<text>&quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles and the first track of the 1968 double album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). Written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership, the song is a parody of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; and the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;California Girls&quot;. The lyrics subvert Berry&#x27;s patriotic sentiments about the United States, as the narrator expresses relief upon returning home to the Soviet Union (officially named Union of Soviet Socialist Republics – USSR).

The Beatles recorded &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as a three-piece after Ringo Starr temporarily left the group, in protest at McCartney&#x27;s criticism of his drumming and the tensions that typified the sessions for the White Album. Instead, the other Beatles created a composite drum track from numerous takes. McCartney&#x27;s singing was based on Jerry Lee Lewis, while the bridge features a Beach Boys–style celebration of girls from various parts of the USSR. The song opens and closes with a tape loop of an aircraft landing on a runway.

Released three months after the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Beatles&#x27; sympathetic portrayal of the USSR prompted condemnation in the West from both the New Left and the political right. In 1976, backed by &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, it was issued as a single to promote the compilation album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;. It peaked at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and number 11 in Ireland. In 2003, McCartney performed the song in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square. Elton John and Billy Joel have also released versions recorded during concerts in Russia.

==Background and inspiration==
Paul McCartney began writing the song as &quot;I&#x27;m Backing the UK&quot;, inspired by the &quot;I&#x27;m Backing Britain&quot; campaign, which had gained wide national support in January 1968, a month before the Beatles departed for India to undertake a course in Transcendental Meditation. According to author Ian MacDonald, McCartney altered the title to &quot;I&#x27;m Backing the USSR&quot; and then, drawing on Chuck Berry&#x27;s 1959 hit song &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot;, arrived at the song&#x27;s eventual title. Donovan, the Scottish singer-songwriter who joined the Beatles in India, said that &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; was one of the &quot;funny little ditties&quot; that McCartney regularly played at the ashram, adding that &quot;of course, melodious ballads just poured out of him&quot;.

In a November 1968 interview for Radio Luxembourg, McCartney said the song was inspired by Berry&#x27;s &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; and was written from the point of view of a Russian spy returning home to the USSR after an extended mission in the United States. Mike Love of the Beach Boys, another student at the meditation retreat, recalled McCartney playing &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; on acoustic guitar over breakfast in Rishikesh, at which point he suggested to McCartney that the bridge section should focus on the &quot;girls&quot; in Russia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Paytress/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the style of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;California Girls&quot;. In his 1984 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, McCartney said he wrote it as &quot;a kind of Beach Boys parody&quot; based on &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; He added:
I just liked the idea of Georgia girls and talking about places like the Ukraine as if they were California, you know? It was also hands across the water, which I&#x27;m still conscious of. &#x27;Cause they like us out there [in Soviet Russia], even though the bosses in the Kremlin may not.

In his lyrics, McCartney transposed the patriotism of Berry&#x27;s song into a Soviet context. He said that he intended it to be a &quot;spoof&quot; on the typical American international traveller&#x27;s contention that &quot;it&#x27;s just so much better back home&quot; and their yearning for the comforts of their homeland. McCartney said that, despite the lack of luxuries in the USSR, his Soviet traveller would &quot;still be every bit as proud [of his home country] as an American would be&quot;. According to author Michael Gray, &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; sardonic comment on Berry&#x27;s idealised Americana, which had become &quot;deeply unfashionable&quot; by the late 1960s.

==Composition==
&quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; opens and closes with the sound of a turboprop aircraft landing on a runway. The effect also appears partway through the recording and represents an &quot;aural cartoon&quot;, according to music critic Tim Riley, who says the song is &quot;offered as a hoot and delivered as such&quot;. The opening lyrics refer to a &quot;dreadful&quot; flight back to the USSR from Miami Beach in the United States, on board a BOAC airliner. Driven by McCartney&#x27;s uptempo piano playing and Harrison&#x27;s lead guitar riffs, the lyrics tell of the singer&#x27;s happiness on returning home, where &quot;the Ukraine girls really knock me out&quot; and the &quot;Moscow girls make me sing and shout&quot;. He invites these women to &quot;Come and keep your comrade warm&quot; and looks forward to hearing the sound of &quot;balalaikas ringing out&quot;.

Cultural historian Doyle Greene describes the song as a parody of Berry&#x27;s &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; &quot;with a bridge that parodies the Beach Boys&#x27; &#x27;California Girls&#x27;&quot;. According to Riley, while &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; is usually viewed as a Beach Boys parody – specifically, a &quot;send-up&quot; of &quot;California Girls&quot; and &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; – its &quot;more direct association&quot; is with Berry&#x27;s track. He adds that Berry&#x27;s focus on commercialism is &quot;relocated and mocked&quot; such that &quot;the joyous return to the Soviet homeland is sarcastic camp.&quot; McCartney&#x27;s lyrics also contain an allusion to Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s and Stuart Gorrell&#x27;s &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;. He sings about the female population of the Soviet Republic of Georgia, right after mentioning &quot;the Ukraine girls&quot; and &quot;Moscow girls&quot;.

==Recording==
The sessions for &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) were fraught with disharmony among the band members. While rehearsing &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, on 22 August 1968, Ringo Starr became tired of McCartney&#x27;s criticism of his drumming on the song, and of the bad atmosphere generally, and walked out, intent on quitting the group. The other Beatles continued with the session, which took place at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London. Ken Scott, the band&#x27;s recording engineer, later recalled that they created a &quot;composite drum track of bits and pieces&quot; in Starr&#x27;s absence.

Five takes were recorded of the basic track, featuring McCartney on drums, George Harrison on electric guitar, and John Lennon on Fender Bass VI. Take 5 was chosen as &quot;best&quot;. During the overdubbing on the song, on 23 August, McCartney and Harrison also contributed bass parts, and both also added lead guitar parts. According to author John Winn, the first overdubs were piano, played by McCartney; drums by Harrison, replacing Lennon&#x27;s bass part from the previous day; and another electric guitar part.

After these additions were mixed down to a single track, McCartney sang a lead vocal, using what he described as his &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis voice&quot;, and Lennon, Harrison and McCartney added backing vocals, including Beach Boys-style harmonies over the song&#x27;s bridges. All three musicians added handclaps. Other overdubs included McCartney&#x27;s bass, Harrison on six-string bass, and Lennon playing a snare drum. Harrison played the guitar solo in the instrumental break, while McCartney contributed a high-pitched, single-note solo over the final verse. MacDonald describes the musical arrangement as a &quot;thunderous wall of sound&quot;. For the sounds of the aircraft that appear on the track, Scott created a tape loop from a recording of a Viscount turboprop stored in EMI&#x27;s library.

After the other Beatles urged him to return, Starr rejoined the group on 4 September to participate in the filming of a promotional clip for their &quot;Hey Jude&quot; single. During a break in the filming, Marc Sinden (who appears in the film) recalls Lennon playing a song on his acoustic guitar. &quot;Everyone went &#x27;Wow&#x27; ... Filming started before we could ask what it was. When it was later released, we realised it was &#x27;Back in the USSR&#x27;.&quot;

==Release==
Apple Records released &quot;The Beatles&quot; on 22 November 1968, with &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; sequenced as the opening song. The turboprop aircraft landing sound at the close of the track was cross-faded with the start of the next song, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;. In 1969, Apple issued &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as a single in Scandinavia, backed by Starr&#x27;s composition &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot;. In 1973, three years after the Beatles&#x27; break-up, the song was included on the band&#x27;s double album compilation &quot;1967–1970&quot;, as one of only three tracks representing the White Album.

On 25 June 1976, the song was issued as a single by Parlophone in the UK to promote the compilation album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;. The B-side was &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, making it the first EMI single by the Beatles to include a non-original composition. It peaked at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, number 11 in Ireland, and number 19 in Sweden. In September 2022, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) awarded the song a silver certification for sales and streaming figures exceeding 200,000 units. EMI made a promotional film for the release, setting the song to footage of the Beatles visiting Amsterdam in 1964 and from their 1966 tour of West Germany. The single was subsequently included in the &quot;Beatles Singles Collection&quot; box set, released by EMI&#x27;s World Division in December 1982, making it the 24th single in the series.

A version by Chubby Checker reached number 86 in Canada, April 28, 1969.

==Critical reception==
In his album review for the &quot;NME&quot;, Alan Smith described the song as &quot;A fantastic piece of screaming excitement. Great opener.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s initial reviewer wrote: &quot;The LP begins with a rock based, falsetto backed number called &#x27;Back In The USSR&#x27; concerning the attributes of Russian women. Wild Harrison guitar and heavy brass lend that soul element as well.&quot; Writing for the same publication, David Griffiths described the song as a &quot;perfectly ingenious&quot; opening track, since:
[I]t serves the purpose of disorientating (both politically and socially) the &quot;average&quot; listener whose mind is likely to be thoroughly confused by such lines as &quot;Back in the US, back in the US, back in the USSR,&quot; and the use of rock and Beach Boy effects to praise Russian chicks. With both Georgias on his mind, perhaps the listener is rendered more receptive. The message comes across that nothing is as simple as it seems and the violence of the beat effectively demonstrates that The Beatles have not gone soft, or too arty, or too far away from the basics, despite their fame and riches.

Writing in &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, Geoffrey Cannon said that &quot;The Beatles&quot; showed the band failing to engage with the contemporary rock audience in the manner that the Rolling Stones had done on their 1968 album &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;. In Cannon&#x27;s view: &quot;The Beatles kick out the jams only in their hard rock numbers: &#x27;Back in the U.S.S.R.&#x27;, &#x27;Birthday&#x27; and &#x27;Helter Skelter&#x27;. But the eclecticism of the first two numbers makes them evanescent. They may intend to be good jokes about the Beach Boys, Chuck Berry and Little Richard; in fact, they hide behind these out-front stars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon/PartisanReview&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Nik Cohn similarly complained that &quot;they hide behind send-up: the middle eight of &#x27;Back in the U.S.S.R.,&#x27; for instance, is pure surf-age Beach Boys but it&#x27;s all half-hearted and limp&quot;.

Jann Wenner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as the &quot;perfect example&quot; of the Beatles&#x27; ability to quote from others&#x27; work and &quot;expand the idiom, but... [also] to penetrate it and take it further&quot; in a way that recent satirical albums by the Turtles and Frank Zappa had failed to do. He added: &quot;It would be too simple to say that &#x27;Back In the USSR&#x27; is a parody, because it operates on more levels than that: it is fine contemporary rock and roll and... also a superb commentary on the United States S. R., hitting every insight – &#x27;honey, disconnect the phone.&#x27; As well as a parody, it&#x27;s also a Beatles song.&quot; Richard Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the double album&#x27;s &quot;burlesque of musical forms&quot;, saying that it represented &quot;almost a mock-history of pop&quot; in which &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; was &quot;a rock primer, quoting the Jefferson Airplane, the Beach Boys, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles&quot;.

Tim Riley describes &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as &quot;Brian Wilson with sex appeal&quot; and an example of how, further to &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, several of McCartney&#x27;s 1968 compositions &quot;straddle the ironic distance between genre treatments and fresh, inventive material that stands well on its own&quot;. In his book on the White Album, David Quantick cites the song as an example of McCartney&#x27;s standing as &quot;a master of pastiche and parody&quot;, adding that &quot;In lesser, feebler, hands, &#x27;Back in the U.S.S.R.&#x27; could have been a rotten comedy song, a weak parody tune, but McCartney – cocky, confident, and able to do almost anything musically – made it into something amazing.&quot; Quantick admires the three Beatles&#x27; musicianship and &quot;hilarious&quot; harmony vocals, and concludes: &quot;The whole thing rocks – and rocks substantially more than the Beach Boys ever did.&quot; In a review coinciding with the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary, John Bohannon of &quot;PopMatters&quot; similarly praised the band&#x27;s performance, including the guitar work and a McCartney vocal that he deemed &quot;one of the best hard rock vocal[s] delivered from below the belt&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; at number 85 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. In a similar list compiled by &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2006, it appeared at number 64.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojo/101 Greatest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary for the magazine, English singer Billy Bragg said that 1968 was when &quot;our love affair with all things American began to turn sour&quot;, with the year marked by reports of US atrocities in Vietnam, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, the gesture of African-American athletes introducing Black Power politics at the Mexico Olympic Games, and Richard Nixon&#x27;s victory in the US presidential race. Bragg added: &quot;By opening [the White Album] with this wonderful inversion of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Back In The USA&quot;, The Beatles made clear whose side they were on... Subversive or just mischievous? You decide.&quot; In 2018, the music staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; ranked the song at number 26 on their list of the best Beatles songs.

==Political controversy and cultural significance==
Like &quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;Piggies&quot;, &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; prompted immediate responses in the US from the New Left and the Right. Among the latter, the John Birch Society&#x27;s magazine cited the song as further evidence of the Beatles&#x27; supposed pro-Soviet sentiments. The line &quot;You don&#x27;t know how lucky you are, boys&quot; left many anti-communist groups stunned. In Riley&#x27;s view, the song&#x27;s mocking tone and communist setting thereby had &quot;the desired effect of inciting the [ire]&quot; of the John Birch Society, who misunderstood the lyrics&#x27; &quot;sympathetic socialism&quot;.

Ian MacDonald described the song as &quot;a rather tactless jest&quot;, given that the Soviet Army had recently invaded Czechoslovakia and thwarted that country&#x27;s attempt to introduce democratic reforms. Some members of the New Left also criticised the Beatles for this gesture.&lt;ref name=&quot;O&#x27;Callaghan/RB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the Beatles were officially derided in the Soviet Union as the &quot;belch of Western culture&quot;. David Noebel, a longstanding critic of the Beatles&#x27; influence on Western youth, said that: &quot;The lyrics have left even the Reds speechless.&quot;

Writing for the website &quot;Russia Beyond&quot;, Tommy O&#x27;Callaghan describes &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as a &quot;parody that became a peace offering&quot;. He says that, just as the Beatles provided a source of unity with the West for contemporary Russian music fans, the band set out to mock the &quot;new Western narrative&quot; presented by both McCarthyism and the New Left. Aside from the send-ups of the Beach Boys, Berry&#x27;s &quot;flag-waving&quot; song and Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;m Backing Britain&#x27; campaign, O&#x27;Callaghan views the references to Russian girls as mocking the &quot;perceived unsexiness&quot; of Soviet culture and says that the song&#x27;s true satirical qualities are in &quot;its portrayal of Russians and Americans at parity&quot;.

Although the Beatles never performed in the USSR, Elton John was permitted to visit the country in 1979 in a historic concert tour, which &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine referred to as the first there by an &quot;out-and-out rock artist&quot;. He sang &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as his closing song throughout the tour,&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson/UCR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring an official request after his opening show that he not do so. Video from these concerts appeared in the documentary film &quot;To Russia with Elton&quot;.

In the 1980s, McCartney was refused permission to perform in the USSR. In Barry Miles&#x27; 1997 book &quot;Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now&quot;, McCartney said that: &quot;Probably my single most important reason for going to Russia would be to play [&#x27;Back in the U.S.S.R.&#x27;]&quot; According to &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;, when McCartney finally got to play the song on his Back in the World tour in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square in May 2003, &quot;the crowd went wild&quot;. When asked about the song before the concert, McCartney said he had known little about the Soviet Union when he wrote it and added: &quot;It was a mystical land then. It&#x27;s nice to see the reality. I always suspected that people had big hearts. Now I know that&#x27;s true.&quot; In his autobiography, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, Mike Love writes: &quot;&#x27;Back in the U.S.S.R.&#x27; was a helluva song, and it&#x27;s lasted longer than the country.&quot;

In 1987, Billy Joel covered the song on his live-in-the-Soviet Union album &quot;Kontsert&quot;. Also released as a single, his version reached number 33 in Australia and number 44 in New Zealand. McCartney said in 1997 that Joel&#x27;s adoption of &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; for his Russian concert tours had contributed to the &quot;jokey&quot; song&#x27;s standing as &quot;a bit of an anthem now&quot;.

On 4 July 1984, the Beach Boys played &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, with Starr joining them as a special guest, during their Fourth of July concerts in Washington, DC, and Miami. In Love&#x27;s recollection, the &quot;irony&quot; of an Englishman being part of the celebrations for America&#x27;s independence from Britain &quot;was not lost on Ringo&quot;. Starr told a reporter: &quot;Happy Birthday [America]... Sorry we lost.&quot;

In 2022, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; and &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; noted the absence of &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, a usual staple of McCartney&#x27;s live concerts, from the setlist of his Got Back tour, in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Immediately preceding the encore at each stop on the tour, McCartney and his fellow band members left the stage and each returned with a flag: the flag of the United Kingdom, the flag of the country they were performing in, an LGBT pride flag, and, in 2022, the flag of Ukraine, as well as the state flag of whichever US state the concert took place in (for example, the flag of Texas at the show in Fort Worth, Texas, and the flag of Florida at the show in Hollywood, Florida).

<text>Kleptomania is the inability to resist the urge to steal items, usually for reasons other than personal use or financial gain. First described in 1816, kleptomania is classified in psychiatry as an impulse control disorder. Some of the main characteristics of the disorder suggest that kleptomania could be an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, but also share similarities with addictive and mood disorders.

The disorder is frequently under-diagnosed and is regularly associated with other psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety, eating disorders, alcohol and substance use. Patients with kleptomania are typically treated with therapies in other areas due to the comorbid grievances rather than issues directly related to kleptomania.

Over the last 100 years, a shift from psychotherapeutic to psychopharmacological interventions for kleptomania has occurred. Pharmacological treatments using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mood stabilizers and opioid receptor antagonists, and other antidepressants along with cognitive behavioral therapy, have yielded positive results. However, there have also been reports of kleptomania induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Some of the fundamental components of kleptomania include recurring intrusive thoughts, impotence to resist the compulsion to engage in stealing, and the release of internal pressure following the act. These symptoms suggest that kleptomania could be regarded as an obsessive-compulsive type of disorder.

People diagnosed with kleptomania often have other types of disorders involving mood, anxiety, eating, impulse control, and drug use. They also have great levels of stress, guilt, and remorse, and privacy issues accompanying the act of stealing. These signs are considered to either cause or intensify general comorbid disorders. The characteristics of the behaviors associated with stealing could result in other problems as well, which include social segregation and substance use. The many types of other disorders frequently occurring along with kleptomania usually make clinical diagnosis uncertain.

There is a difference between ordinary theft and kleptomania: &quot;ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and motivated by the usefulness of the object or its monetary worth,&quot; whereas with kleptomania, there &quot;is the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items even though the items are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value.&quot;

== Cause ==
Initial models of the development of kleptomania came from the field of psychoanalysis. These have been replaced by cognitive-behavioral models, which supplement biological ones based mostly on pharmacotherapy treatment studies.

=== Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approach ===
Several explanations of the mechanics of kleptomania have been presented. A contemporary social approach proposes that kleptomania is an outcome of consumerism and the large quantity of commodities in society. Psychodynamic theories depend on a variety of points of view in defining the disorder. Psychoanalysts define the condition as an indication of a defense mechanism deriving in the unconscious ego against anxiety, prohibited intuition or desires, unsettled struggle or forbidden sexual drives, dread of castration, sexual excitement, and sexual fulfillment and orgasm throughout the act of stealing. The psychoanalytic and psycho-dynamic approach to kleptomania granted the basis for prolonged psychoanalytic or psycho-dynamic psychotherapy as the core treatment method for a number of years. Like most psychiatric conditions, kleptomania was observed within the psycho-dynamic lens instead of being viewed as a bio-medical disorder. However, the prevalence of psychoanalytic approach contributed to the growth of other approaches, particularly in the biological domain.

Many psychoanalytic theorists suggested that kleptomania is a person&#x27;s attempt &quot;to obtain symbolic compensation for an actual or anticipated loss&quot;, and feel that the key to understanding its etiology lies in the symbolic meaning of the stolen items. Drive theory was used to propose that the act of stealing is a defense mechanism which serves to modulate or keep undesirable feelings or emotions from being expressed. Some French psychiatrists suggest that kleptomaniacs may just want the item that they steal and the feeling they get from theft itself.

=== Cognitive-behavioral models ===
Cognitive-behavioral models have been replacing psychoanalytic models in describing the development of kleptomania. Cognitive-behavioral practitioners often conceptualize the disorders as being the result of operant conditioning, behavioral chaining, distorted cognitions, and poor coping mechanisms. Cognitive-behavioral models suggest that the behavior is positively reinforced after the person steals some items. If this individual experiences minimal or no negative consequences (punishment), then the likelihood that the behavior will reoccur is increased. As the behavior continues to occur, stronger antecedents or cues become contingently linked with it, in what ultimately becomes a powerful behavioral chain. According to cognitive-behavioral theory (CBT), both antecedents and consequences may either be in the environment or cognitions. For example, Kohn and Antonuccio (2002) describe a client&#x27;s antecedent cognitions, which include thoughts such as &quot;I’m smarter than others and can get away with it&quot;; &quot;they deserve it&quot;; &quot;I want to prove to myself that I can do it&quot;; and &quot;my family deserves to have better things&quot;. These thoughts were strong cues to stealing behaviors. All of these thoughts were precipitated by additional antecedents which were thoughts about family, financial, and work stressors or feelings of depression. &quot;Maintaining&quot; cognitions provided additional reinforcement for stealing behaviors and included feelings of vindication and pride, for example: &quot;score one for the &#x27;little guy&#x27; against the big corporations&quot;. Although those thoughts were often afterward accompanied by feelings of remorse, this came too late in the operant sequence to serve as a viable punisher. Eventually, individuals with kleptomania come to rely upon stealing as a way of coping with stressful situations and distressing feelings, which serve to further maintain the behavior and decrease the number of available alternative coping strategies.

=== Biological models ===
Biological models explaining the origins of kleptomania have been based mostly on pharmacotherapy treatment studies that used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mood stabilizers, and opioid receptor antagonists.

Some studies using SSRIs have observed that opioid antagonists appear to reduce the urge to steal and mute the &quot;rush&quot; typically experienced immediately after stealing by some subjects with kleptomania. This would suggest that poor regulation of serotonin, dopamine, and/or natural opioids within the brain are to blame for kleptomania, linking it with impulse control and affective disorders.

An alternative explanation too based on opioid antagonist studies states that kleptomania is similar to the &quot;self-medication&quot; model, in which stealing stimulates the person&#x27;s natural opioid system. &quot;The opioid release &#x27;soothes&#x27; the patients, treats their sadness, or reduces their anxiety. Thus, stealing is a mechanism to relieve oneself from a chronic state of hyperarousal, perhaps produced by prior stressful or traumatic events, and thereby modulate affective states.&quot;

== Diagnosis ==
Disagreement surrounds the method by which kleptomania is considered and diagnosed. On one hand, some researchers believe that kleptomania is merely theft and dispute the suggestion that there are psychological mechanisms involved, while others observe kleptomania as part of a substance-related addiction. Yet others categorize kleptomania as a variation of an impulse control disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or eating disorders.

According to the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; fourth edition (DSM IV-TR), a frequent and widely used guide for the diagnosis of mental disorders, the following symptoms and characteristics are the diagnostic criteria for kleptomania:
# repeated inability to defend against urges to steal things that are not essential for private use or for their economic value;
# escalating sense of pressure immediately prior to performing the theft;
# satisfaction, fulfillment or relief at the point of performing the theft;
# the theft is not executed to convey antagonism or revenge, and is not in reaction to a delusion or a fantasy; and
# the thieving is not better accounted for by behavior disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder.

Skeptics have decried kleptomania as an invalid psychiatric concept exploited in legal defenses of wealthy female shoplifters. During the twentieth century, kleptomania was strongly linked with the increased prevalence of department stores, and &quot;department store kleptomaniacs&quot; were a widely held social stereotype that had political implications.

== Comorbidity ==
Kleptomania seems to be linked with other psychiatric disorders, especially mood swings, anxiety, eating disorders, and alcohol and substance use. The occurrence of stealing as a behavior in conjunction with eating disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, is frequently taken as a sign of the harshness of the eating disorder.

A likely connection between depression and kleptomania was reported as early as 1911. It has since been extensively established in clinical observations and available case reports. The mood disorder could come first or co-occur with the beginning of kleptomania. In advanced cases, depression may result in self-inflicted injury and could even lead to suicide. Some people have reported relief from depression or manic symptoms after theft.

It has been suggested that because kleptomania is linked to strong compulsive and impulsive qualities, it can be viewed as a variation of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, together with pathological gambling, compulsive buying, pyromania, nailbiting and trichotillomania. This point achieves support from the unusually higher cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; see below) in close relatives of patients with kleptomania.

=== Substance use disorder ===
Kleptomania and drug addictions seem to have central qualities in common, including:
* recurring or compulsive participation in a behavior in spite of undesirable penalties;
* weakened control over the disturbing behavior;
* a need or desire condition before taking part in the problematic behavior; and
* a positive pleasure-seeking condition throughout the act of the disturbing behavior.
Data from epidemiological studies additionally propose that there is an affiliation between kleptomania and substance use disorders along with high rates in a unidirectional manner. Phenomenological data maintain that there is a relationship between kleptomania and drug addictions. A higher percentage of cases of kleptomania has been noted in adolescents and young adults, and a lesser number of cases among older adults, which imply an analogous natural history to that seen in substance use disorders. Family history data also propose a probable common genetic input to alcohol use and kleptomania. Substance use disorders are more common in kin of persons with kleptomania than in the general population. Furthermore, pharmacological data (e.g., the probable efficacy of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, in the treatment of both kleptomania and substance use disorders) could present additional support for a joint relationship between kleptomania and substance use disorders. Based on the idea that kleptomania and substance use disorders may share some etiological features, it could be concluded that kleptomania would react optimistically to the same treatments. As a matter of fact, certain non-medical treatment methods that are successful in treating substance use are also accommodating in treating kleptomania.

=== Obsessive-compulsive disorder ===
Kleptomania is frequently thought of as being a part of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), since the irresistible and uncontrollable actions are similar to the frequently excessive, unnecessary, and unwanted rituals of OCD. Some individuals with kleptomania demonstrate hoarding symptoms that resemble those with OCD.
Prevalence rates between the two disorders do not demonstrate a strong relationship. Studies examining the comorbidity of OCD in subjects with kleptomania have inconsistent results, with some showing a relatively high co-occurrence (45%-60%) while others demonstrate low rates (0%-6.5%). Similarly, when rates of kleptomania have been examined in subjects with OCD, a relatively low co-occurrence was found (2.2%-5.9%).

=== Pyromania ===
Pyromania, another impulse disorder, has many ties to kleptomania. Many pyromaniacs begin fires alongside petty stealing which often appears similar to kleptomania.

== Treatment ==
Although the disorder has been known to psychologists for a long time, the cause of kleptomania is still ambiguous. Therefore, a diverse range of therapeutic approaches have been introduced for its treatment. These treatments include: psychoanalytic oriented psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy.

=== Behavioral and cognitive intervention ===
Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has primarily substituted the psychoanalytic and dynamic approach in the treatment of kleptomania. Numerous behavioural approaches have been recommended as helpful according to several cases stated in the literature. They include: hidden sensitisation by unpleasant images of nausea and vomiting, aversion therapy (for example, aversive holding of breath to achieve a slightly painful feeling every time a desire to steal or the act is imagined), and systematic desensitisation. In certain instances, the use of combining several methods such as hidden sensitisation along with exposure and response prevention were applied. Even though the approaches used in CBT need more research and investigation in kleptomania, success in combining these methods with medication was illustrated over the use of drug treatment as the single method of treatment.

=== Drug treatment ===
The phenomenological similarity and the suggested common basic biological dynamics of kleptomania and OCD, pathological gambling and trichotillomania gave rise to the theory that the similar groups of medications could be used in all these conditions. Consequently, the primary use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) group, which is a form of antidepressant, has been used in kleptomania and other impulse control disorders such as binge eating and OCD. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), lithium and valproic acid (sodium valproate) have been used as well.

The SSRI&#x27;s usage is due to the assumption that the biological dynamics of these conditions derives from low levels of serotonin in brain synapses, and that the efficacy of this type of therapy will be relevant to kleptomania and to other comorbid conditions.

Opioid receptor antagonists are regarded as practical in lessening urge-related symptoms, which is a central part of impulse control disorders; for this reason, they are used in treatment of substance use. This quality makes them helpful in treating kleptomania and impulse control disorders in general. The most frequently used drug is naltrexone, a long-acting competitive antagonist. Naltrexone acts mainly at μ-receptors, but also antagonises κ- and λ-receptors.

There have been no controlled studies of the psycho-pharmacological treatment of kleptomania. This could be as a consequence of kleptomania being a rare phenomenon and the difficulty in achieving a large enough sample. Facts about this issue come largely from case reports or from bits and pieces gathered from a comparatively small number of cases enclosed in a group series.

== History ==
In the nineteenth century, French psychiatrists began to observe kleptomaniacal behavior, but were constrained by their approach. By 1890, a large body of case material on kleptomania had been developed. Hysteria, imbecility, cerebral defect, and menopause were advanced as theories to explain these seemingly nonsensical behaviors, and many linked kleptomania to immaturity, given the inclination of young children to take whatever they want. These French and German observations later became central to psychoanalytic explanations of kleptomania.

=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;kleptomania&quot; was derived from the Greek words &quot;&quot; (klepto) &quot;to steal&quot; and &quot;&quot; (mania) &quot;mad desire, compulsion&quot;. Its meaning roughly corresponds to &quot;compulsion to steal&quot; or &quot;compulsive stealing&quot;.

=== First generation of psychoanalysis ===
In the early twentieth century, kleptomania was viewed more as a legal excuse for self-indulgent haut bourgeois ladies than a valid psychiatric ailment by French psychiatrists.

Sigmund Freud, the creator of controversial psychoanalytic theory, believed that the underlying dynamics of human behaviours associated with uncivilized savages—impulses were curbed by inhibitions for social life. He did not believe human behaviour to be rational. He created a large theoretical corpus which his disciples applied to such psychological problems as kleptomania. In 1924, one of his followers, Wilhelm Stekel, read the case of a female kleptomaniac who was driven by suppressed sexual urges to take hold of &quot;something forbidden, secretly&quot;. Stekel concluded that kleptomania was &quot;suppressed and superseded sexual desire carried out through medium of a symbol or symbolic action. Every compulsion in psychic life is brought about by suppression&quot;.

=== Second generation of psychoanalysis ===
Fritz Wittels argued that kleptomaniacs were sexually underdeveloped people who felt deprived of love and had little experience with human sexual relationships; stealing was their sex life, giving them thrills so powerful that they did not want to be cured. Male kleptomaniacs, in his view, were homosexual or invariably effeminate.

A famous large-scale analysis of shoplifters in the United Kingdom ridiculed Stekel&#x27;s notion of sexual symbolism and claimed that one out of five apprehended shoplifters was a &quot;psychiatric&quot;.

=== New perspectives ===
Empirically based conceptual articles have argued that kleptomania is becoming more common than previously thought, and occurs more frequently among women than men. These ideas are new in recent history but echo those current in the mid to late nineteenth century.

<text>HMAS &quot;Betano&quot; (L 133) was a heavy landing craft operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The eight-vessel &quot;Balikpapan&quot; class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army&#x27;s LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft. They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of . The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach . The standard ship&#x27;s company is 13-strong. The &quot;Balikpapan&quot;s are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two machine guns for self-defence.

The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armoured personnel carriers, 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a &quot;Balikpapan&quot;-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel&#x27;s payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages.

&quot;Betano&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 3 October 1972, launched on 12 December 1972, and commissioned into the RAN on 8 February 1974.

==Operational history==
In April 1974, &quot;Betano&quot;, &quot;Buna&quot;, and &quot;Brunei&quot; transited to Lord Howe Island as a demonstration of the &quot;Balikpanan&quot; class&#x27; oceangoing capabilities.

Following the destruction of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy during the night of 24–25 December 1974, &quot;Betano&quot; was deployed as part of the relief effort; Operation Navy Help Darwin. &quot;Betano&quot; sailed from Brisbane on 26 December.

From 1985 to 1988, &quot;Betano&quot; and &quot;Brunei&quot; were assigned to the Australian Hydrographic Officer and operated as survey ships in the waters of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea.

The ship was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 January to 19 February 2000. Her service earned her the battle honour &quot;East Timor 2000&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Betano&quot; was decommissioned at Darwin on 12 December 2012. The Philippine Navy has shown interest in acquiring the ship after the Australian government donated two sister ships, and in 2015. It was later confirmed that the Philippine Navy will acquire three more LCHs from Australia, including ex-HMAS &quot;Betano&quot;, at a token price.

<text>The Pee Dee River, also known as the Great Pee Dee River, is a river in the Carolinas of the United States. It originates in the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina, where its upper course, above the mouth of the Uwharrie River, is known as the Yadkin River. The river empties into Winyah Bay, and then into the Atlantic Ocean near Georgetown.

The northeastern counties of South Carolina compose the Pee Dee region of the state.

The exposed rock formations along its course are the source of a NIST reference standard.

It is an important source of electric power and public water supplies, as well as recreational use. 

While the Pee Dee is free-flowing in South Carolina, upstream in North Carolina, several dams have been constructed on it. The opening and closing of these dams causes dramatic swings in the depth of the river in South Carolina. The sharing of water between the two states has sometimes been a matter of controversy, particularly during periods of drought. 

Some commercial fishing is done during the winter shad run, and for shrimp in the lower reaches. The river is excellent for recreational fishing and boating. 

There are numerous boat landings, yet most of the river is wild, with forests of tupelo, oak and gum along its shores. Herons and alligators can be seen along the way, and a lucky sighting of a bald eagle is possible.

Public and private organizations have restored and conserved sections of the Pee Dee River in South Carolina, along with the streams and wetlands around it, with ongoing efforts to restore and conserve even more sections of the river.

The lower part of the river from Highway 378 to Winyah Bay has been designated a Scenic River.

==History==
The river flows through the territory of the historic Pee Dee tribe, and is named after them. The Pee Dee were a part of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture. The first Europeans believed to have possibly navigated part of the river was a party sent by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón in 1521.

Snow&#x27;s Island is a large island at the Pee Dee and Lynches rivers junction. It has been identified as the center of Johnsonville Impact Crater. The island was the headquarters of General Francis Marion for several months during the American Revolution. It proved a haven for him and his militia troops, as the British were unable to find the camp until it was abandoned.

The world&#x27;s largest lumber company existed at the turn of the 20th century near the river&#x27;s mouth at Georgetown. The virgin pine forests of the Pee Dee region were cutover, and the logs floated in rafts downriver to be sawn into lumber and exported to the northern United States and Europe.

==Tributaries==
Some tributaries are the Lumber, the Little Pee Dee, Lynches, Black and Waccamaw rivers.

The river was an important trade route through the Low Country from colonial times. It is navigable from the Atlantic up to the Fall Line at Cheraw.

Today the river is not extensively used for navigation. 

==Rice==
The lower part of the river flood plain was extensively developed for rice culture in colonial time; rice was the major export of the area from the port at Georgetown. Rice culture declined with the freedom of slave labor after the Civil War and with increased overseas competition. Two hurricanes at the beginning of the 20th century destroyed much of the rice canal infrastructure and effectively ended the remnants of rice culture.

<text>was a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine, the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the shark.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Shark&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 24 October 1933. She was launched on 21 May 1935, sponsored by Miss Ruth Ellen Lonergan, the 12-year-old daughter of United States Senator Augustine Lonergan of Connecticut, and commissioned on 25 January 1936.

==Inter-war period==

===Asiatic Fleet===
Following shakedown in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Shark&quot; transited the Panama Canal and arrived at San Diego, California on 4 March 1937. She spent the next year and one-half in training exercises and Army-Navy war problems as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6). Following a regular overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, &quot;Shark&quot; got underway from San Diego on 16 December 1938 bound for Pearl Harbor and reassignment to SubRon 4.

Following two years of operations in the Hawaii area, &quot;Shark&quot; set sail from Pearl Harbor on 3 December 1940 to join the Asiatic Fleet based at Manila, where she engaged in fleet tactics and exercises until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Departing Manila on 9 December 1941, she was at sea during the Japanese bombing raids on Manila the next day. For the next week, &quot;Shark&quot; patrolled Tayabas Bay until ordered back to Manila on 19 December to embark Admiral Thomas C. Hart, Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet, for transportation to Soerabaja, Java.

==World War II==
On 6 January 1942, &quot;Shark&quot; was almost hit by a torpedo from an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine. A few days later, she was ordered to Ambon Island, where a Japanese invasion was expected. On 27 January, she was directed to join the submarines patrolling in Molucca Passage, then to cover the passage east of Lifamatola and Bangka Strait. On 2 February 1942, &quot;Shark&quot; reported to her base at Soerabaja, Java, that she had been depth-charged off Tifore Island and had failed to sink a Japanese ship during a torpedo attack. On 7 February, she reported chasing an empty cargo ship headed northwest, for which the Asiatic Fleet submarine commander, Captain John E. Wilkes, upbraided Shane. No further messages were received from &quot;Shark&quot;. On 8 February, she was told to proceed to Makassar Strait and later was told to report information. Nothing was heard and, on 7 March 1942, &quot;Shark&quot; was reported as presumed lost, the victim of unknown causes. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 June 1942.

&quot;Shark&quot; may have been the first U.S. submarine sunk by enemy antisubmarine forces. Post-war, Japanese records showed numerous attacks on unidentified submarines in &quot;Shark&quot;″s area at plausible times. At 01:37 on 11 February, for example, the Japanese destroyer opened fire with her guns and sank a surfaced submarine. &quot;Yamakaze&quot;′s crew heard voices in the water, but made no attempt to rescue possible survivors.

<text>HMAS &quot;Bombard&quot; (P 99) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Bombard&quot; was built by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 6 July 1968, and commissioned on 5 November 1968.

==Operational history==
During 1978 and 1979, &quot;Bombard&quot; was one of two &quot;Attack&quot;-class vessels used to portray the fictional HMAS &quot;Ambush&quot; for ABC drama series &quot;Patrol Boat&quot;. For this, &quot;Bombard&quot;″s pennant number was changed to 83, to match the other patrol boat used, .

&quot;Bombard&quot; paid off on 12 September 1983, was transferred to the Indonesian Navy and renamed KRI &quot;Siribua&quot;. The patrol boat was listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as still operational in 2011.

<text>HMAS &quot;Bowen&quot; (J285/M285), named for the town of Bowen, Queensland, was a of the Royal Australian Navy.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Bowen&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Bowen&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 9 February 1942, launched on 11 June 1942 by Mrs. Crittal and commissioned on 9 November 1942.

==Operational history==
The corvette operated in the South West Pacific area during World War II, and earned the battle honours &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot; for her service.

==Fate==
&quot;Bowen&quot; paid off on 17 January 1946 and was sold for scrap to the Hong Kong Rolling Mills on 18 May 1956.

<doc id="436059" wikidata="Q111146" url="?curid=436059" title="Hematocrit">
<text>The hematocrit () (Ht or HCT), also known by several other names, is the volume percentage (vol%) of red blood cells (RBCs) in blood, measured as part of a blood test. The measurement depends on the number and size of red blood cells. It is normally 40.7–50.3% for males and 36.1–44.3% for females. It is a part of a person&#x27;s complete blood count results, along with hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count and platelet count.

Because the purpose of red blood cells is to transfer oxygen from the lungs to body tissues, a blood sample&#x27;s hematocrit—the red blood cell volume percentage—can become a point of reference of its capability of delivering oxygen. Hematocrit levels that are too high or too low can indicate a blood disorder, dehydration, or other medical conditions. An abnormally low hematocrit may suggest anemia, a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells, while an abnormally high hematocrit is called polycythemia. Both are potentially life-threatening disorders.

==Names==
There are other names for the hematocrit, such as &quot;packed cell volume&quot; (PCV), &quot;volume of packed red cells&quot; (VPRC), or &quot;erythrocyte volume fraction&quot; (EVF). The term &quot;hematocrit&quot; (or &quot;haematocrit&quot; in British English) comes from the Ancient Greek words (, &quot;blood&quot;) and (, &quot;judge&quot;), and hematocrit means &quot;to separate blood&quot;. It was coined in 1891 by Swedish physiologist Magnus Blix as &quot;haematokrit&quot;, modeled after &quot;lactokrit&quot;.

==Measurement methods==
With modern lab equipment, the hematocrit can be calculated by an automated analyzer or directly measured, depending on the analyzer manufacturer. Calculated hematocrit is determined by multiplying the red cell count by the mean cell volume. The hematocrit is slightly more accurate, as the PCV includes small amounts of blood plasma trapped between the red cells. An estimated hematocrit as a percentage may be derived by tripling the hemoglobin concentration in g/dL and dropping the units.

The packed cell volume (PCV) can be determined by centrifuging EDTA-treated or heparinized blood in a capillary tube (also known as a microhematocrit tube) at 10,000 RPM for five minutes. This separates the blood into layers. The volume of packed red blood cells divided by the total volume of the blood sample gives the PCV. Since a tube is used, this can be calculated by measuring the lengths of the layers.

Another way of measuring hematocrit levels is by optical methods such as spectrophotometry. Through differential spectrophotometry, the differences in optical densities of a blood sample flowing through small-bore glass tubes at isosbestic wavelengths for deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin and the product of the luminal diameter and hematocrit create a linear relationship that is used to measure hematocrit levels.

Other than potential bruising at the puncture site, and/or dizziness, there are no complications associated with this test.

While known hematocrit levels are used in detecting conditions, it may fail at times due to hematocrit being the measure of concentration of red blood cells through volume in a blood sample. It does not account for the mass of the red blood cells, and thus the changes in mass can alter a hematocrit level or go undetected while affecting a subject&#x27;s condition. Additionally, there have been cases in which the blood for testing was inadvertently drawn proximal to an intravenous line that was infusing packed red cells or fluids. In these situations, the hemoglobin level in the blood sample will not be the true level for the patient because the sample will contain a large amount of the infused material rather than what is diluted into the circulating whole blood. That is, if packed red cells are being supplied, the sample will contain a large amount of those cells and the hematocrit will be artificially very high.

== Levels ==
Hematocrit can vary from the determining factors of the number of red blood cells. These factors can be from the age and sex of the subject. The normal hematocrit level is around 40% for adult women and about 45% for adult men. In newborns, it is approximately 55% and drops to around 35% by 2 months of age. After that, it gradually increases during development, reaching adult levels at puberty. Following this, the hematocrit level gradually decreases with aging. Typically, a higher hematocrit level signifies the blood sample&#x27;s ability to transport oxygen, which has led to reports that an &quot;optimal hematocrit level&quot; may exist. Optimal hematocrit levels have been studied through combinations of assays on blood sample&#x27;s hematocrit itself, viscosity, and hemoglobin level.

Hematocrit levels also serve as an indicator of health conditions. Thus, tests on hematocrit levels are often carried out in the process of diagnosis of such conditions, and may be conducted prior to surgery. Additionally, the health conditions associated with certain hematocrit levels are the same as ones associated with certain hemoglobin levels. As blood flows from the arterioles into the capillaries, a change in pressure occurs. In order to maintain pressure, the capillaries branch off to a web of vessels that carry blood into the venules. Through this process blood undergoes micro-circulation. In micro-circulation, the Fåhræus effect will take place, resulting in a large change in hematocrit. As blood flows through the arterioles, red cells will act a feed hematocrit (Hf), while in the capillaries, a tube hematocrit (Ht) occurs. In tube hematocrit, plasma fills most of the vessel while the red cells travel through in somewhat of a single file line. From this stage, blood will enter the venules increasing in hematocrit, in other words the discharge hematocrit (Hd).In large vessels with low hematocrit, viscosity dramatically drops and red cells take in a lot of energy.

Relationships between hematocrit, viscosity, and shear rate are important factors to put into consideration. Since blood is non-Newtonian, the viscosity of the blood is in relation to the hematocrit, and as a function of shear rate. This is important when it comes to determining shear force, since a lower hematocrit level indicates that there is a need for more force to push the red blood cells through the system. This is because shear rate is defined as the rate to which adjacent layers of fluid move in respect to each other. Plasma is a more viscous material than typically red blood cells, since they are able to adjust their size to the radius of a tube; the shear rate is purely dependent on the amount of red blood cells being forced in a vessel.

===Elevated===
Generally at both sea levels and high altitudes, hematocrit levels rise as children mature. These health-related causes and impacts of elevated hematocrit levels have been reported:
* Fall in blood plasma levels
* Dehydration
* Administering of testosterone supplement therapy
* Anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use can also increase the amount of RBCs and, therefore, impact the hematocrit, in particular the compounds boldenone and oxymetholone.
* In cases of dengue fever, a high hematocrit is a danger sign of an increased risk of dengue shock syndrome. Hemoconcentration can be detected by an escalation of over 20% in hematocrit levels that will come before shock. For early detection of dengue hemorrhagic fever, it is suggested that hematocrit levels be kept under observations at a minimum of every 24 hours; 3–4 hours is suggested in suspected dengue shock syndrome or critical cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever.
* Polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces excessive numbers of red cells, is associated with elevated hematocrit.
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxia may elicit an increased production of red blood cells. This increase is mediated by the increased levels of erythropoietin by the kidneys in response to hypoxia.
* Professional athletes&#x27; hematocrit levels are measured as part of tests for blood doping or erythropoietin (EPO) use; the level of hematocrit in a blood sample is compared with the long-term level for that athlete (to allow for individual variations in hematocrit level), and against an absolute permitted maximum (which is based on maximum expected levels within the population, and the hematocrit level that causes increased risk of blood clots resulting in strokes or heart attacks).
* Capillary leak syndrome also leads to abnormally high hematocrit counts, because of the episodic leakage of plasma out of the circulatory system.
* At higher altitudes, there is a lower oxygen supply in the air and thus hematocrit levels may increase over time.

Hematocrit levels were also reported to be correlated with social factors that influence subjects. In the 1966–80 Health Examination Survey, there was a small rise in mean hematocrit levels in female and male adolescents that reflected a rise in annual family income. Additionally, a higher education in a parent has been put into account for a rise in mean hematocrit levels of the child.

===Lowered===
Lowered hematocrit levels also pose health impacts. These causes and impacts have been reported:
* A low hematocrit level is a sign of a low red blood cell count. One way to increase the ability of oxygen transport in red blood cells is through blood transfusion, which is carried out typically when the red blood cell count is low. Prior to the blood transfusion, hematocrit levels are measured to help ensure the transfusion is necessary and safe.
* A low hematocrit with a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with a high red cell distribution width (RDW) suggests a chronic iron-deficient anemia resulting in abnormal hemoglobin synthesis during erythropoiesis. The MCV and the RDW can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower-than-normal hematocrit, because they can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute, although acute blood loss typically does not manifest as a change in hematocrit, since hematocrit is simply a measure of how much of the blood volume is made up of red blood cells. The MCV is the size of the red cells and the RDW is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population.
* Decreased hematocrit levels could indicate life-threatening diseases such as leukemia. When the bone marrow no longer produces normal red blood cells, hematocrit levels deviate from normal as well and thus can possibly be used in detecting acute myeloid leukemia. It can also be related to other conditions, such as malnutrition, water intoxication, anemia, and bleeding.
* Pregnancy may lead to women having additional fluid in blood. This could potentially lead to a small drop in hematocrit levels.

<text>USS &quot;Pickerel&quot; (SS-177), a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pickerel, species of freshwater fish native to the eastern United States and Canada.

Her keel was laid on 25 March 1935 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 7 July 1936 sponsored by Miss Evelyn Standley, daughter of Rear Admiral William Standley, acting Secretary of the Navy. She was commissioned on 26 January 1937, Lieutenant Leon J. Huffman in command.

==Service history==

===Inter-War Period===
After her shakedown cruise, the new boat conducted training exercises out of New London, Connecticut until getting underway on 26 October 1937 and heading, via Guantánamo Bay, Cuba to transit the Panama Canal on 9 November. Joining the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Pickerel&quot; operated out of San Diego, California, along the West Coast, and in Hawaiian waters. Subsequently, transferred to the Asiatic Fleet, she prepared for war with a vigorous training schedule in the Philippines.

===World War II===
Upon receiving word of Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Pickerel&quot; – commanded by Lieutenant Commander Barton E. Bacon, Jr. – sped to the coast of French Indochina and conducted her first war patrol off Cam Ranh Bay and Tourane Harbor. She tracked a Japanese submarine and a destroyer but lost them in haze and rain squalls before they came in torpedo range. On 19 December, she also missed a small Japanese patrol craft with five torpedoes, before returning to Manila Bay on 29 December.

On her second patrol (31 December 1941 – 29 January 1942), conducted between Manila and Surabaya, the submarine sank &quot;Kanko Maru&quot; on 10 January 1942. On her third war patrol (7 February–19 March), along the Malay Barrier, and her fourth (15 April–6 June), in the Philippines, she failed to score.

&quot;Pickerel&quot;″s fifth war patrol (10 July–26 August), was a voyage from Brisbane, Australia, to Pearl Harbor for refit, with a short patrol in the Mariana Islands &quot;en route&quot;, during which she damaged a freighter. During the refit, LCDR Bacon was detached and &quot;Pickerel&quot;″s executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Augustus H. Alston, Jr., became her new CO.

On her sixth war patrol (22 January–3 March 1943), she searched among the Kurile Islands on the Tokyo-Kiska traffic lanes. In sixteen attacks, she sank &quot;Tateyama Maru&quot; and two 35-ton sampans.

She departed Pearl Harbor on 18 March 1943 and, after topping off with fuel and provisions at Midway Island on 22 March, headed for the eastern coast of northern Honshū, Japan and was never heard from again. &quot;Pickerel&quot; was the first submarine to be lost in the Central Pacific area. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 August 1943.

Post-war analysis of Japanese records give conflicting suggestions about &quot;Pickerel&quot;″s fate. The Japanese officially credit her with sinking &quot;Submarine Chaser Number 13&quot; on 3 April and &quot;Fukuei Maru&quot; on 7 April, and give no official report of her destruction. Those records also describe an action off Shiramuka Lighthouse on northern Honshū on 3 April 1943 in which naval aircraft first bombed an unidentified submarine, then directed &quot;Shiragami&quot; and &quot;Bunzan Maru&quot; to the spot, where they dropped twenty-six depth charges. A large quantity of oil floated to the surface, which was often enough for Japanese ASW ships to believe their target was sunk. It is likely &quot;Pickerel&quot;″s fuel oil bunkers leaked. Since there were several other ASW operations in the area in that period, and &quot;Pickerel&quot; was the only American submarine in that area, one of these other attacks, sometime after 7 April, probably claimed her.

<text>The Statistical Abstract of the United States was a publication of the United States Census Bureau, an agency of the United States Department of Commerce. Published annually from 1878 to 2011, the statistics described social, political and economic conditions in the United States.

The Census Bureau ceased publication with the 2012 edition, released in August 2011; the Bureau stopped compiling the data for the Statistical Compendia program, including the &quot;Abstract&quot; and supplemental publications, on October 1, 2011.

A &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist, Robert J. Samuelson, wrote &quot;This is a mighty big loss for a mighty small saving.&quot; The agency’s 2012 budget would eliminate the Statistical Compendia Branch, which compiles the Statistical Abstract and other publications (such as the “County and City Data Book”). This would save $2.9 million and cut 24 jobs. Both the book and online versions of the Statistical Abstract would vanish. The American Library Association, representing about 16,700 public libraries and more than 100,000 academic and school libraries, is arguing to keep the Statistical Abstract. Alesia McManus, library director at Howard Community College in Columbia, started a Facebook page and launched a petition dedicated to reversing the decision, wrote Samuelson. He quoted one librarian as writing “If the library were on fire, this would be the reference book I would try and save first”, and another as saying “[The] Statistical Abstract has for years been one of the top five reference books used by students and faculty at South Dakota State University.” Samuelson said he didn&#x27;t think the librarians&#x27; protest would have much effect.

Joseph Dionne and Paul Krugman published columns agreeing with Samuelson.

ProQuest continued the series, in co-operation with Bernan Press. The list price of the 2012 Department of Commerce edition was $20 (paperback), free online. The list price of the Proquest edition is $199.

In 1975, a Bicentennial Edition, &quot;Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970&quot;, in two volumes, was published.

The 2010 (129th Edition) Statistical Abstract of the United States has 30 sections, 926 pages, and more than 1,300 tables, covering more than 200 topics, including income and wealth, imports and exports, agriculture, energy production and consumption, natural resources, and some international comparisons. All information is downloadable in PDF and Excel spreadsheet formats. The statistical abstract is the standard summary of statistics on the social, political, and economic organization of the United States. It is also designed to serve as a guide to other statistical publications and sources.

<text>HMAS &quot;Broome&quot; (J191), named for the town of Broome, Western Australia, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II and one of 20 built for the Admiralty but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Broome&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.
&quot;Broome&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane on 3 May 1941, launched on 6 October 1941 by Mrs. M. J. McKew, wife of the shipyard&#x27;s works manager, and commissioned on 29 July 1942.

==Operational history==
The corvette operated during World War II, and was awarded the battle honours &quot;Pacific 1942-45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1942-44&quot; for her service.

HMAS &quot;Broome&quot; paid off on 24 August 1946, was sold to the Turkish Navy and renamed &quot;Alanya&quot;. The vessel left Turkish service in 1975. The ship&#x27;s bell was recovered before the sale, and returned to Broome. It was presented to the Broome Road Board in June 1952, who then passed the bell on to Broome State School in November. The bell later ended up at the town&#x27;s Returned and Services League club.

<text>HMAS &quot;Buccaneer&quot; (P 100) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Buccaneer&quot; was built by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, Queensland, launched on 14 September 1968, and commissioned on 11 November 1969.

==Operational history==
==Fate==
&quot;Buccaneer&quot; paid off on 27 July 1984, and was sunk by gunfire during target practice on 8 October 1988.

<text>HMPNGS &quot;Buna&quot; is a heavy landing craft operated by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF). Prior to 1974, the vessel was called HMAS &quot;Buna&quot; (L 132) and was operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The eight-vessel &quot;Balikpapan&quot; class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army&#x27;s LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft. They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of . The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. They are propelled by two GM Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach . The standard ship&#x27;s company is 13-strong. The &quot;Balikpapan&quot;s are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two machine guns for self-defence.

The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armored personnel carriers 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a &quot;Balikpapan&quot;-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel&#x27;s payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages.

&quot;Buna&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 31 July 1972, launched on 26 September 1972, and commissioned into the RAN on 7 December 1973.

==Operational history==
In April 1974, &quot;Buna&quot;, &quot;Betano&quot;, and &quot;Brunei&quot; transited to Lord Howe Island as a demonstration of the &quot;Balikpanan&quot; class&#x27; oceangoing capabilities.

On 14 November 1974, &quot;Buna&quot; was decommissioned from RAN service and transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. In June 2021, &quot;Buna&quot; was decommissioned from PNGDF service.

<text>Diamond Light Source (or Diamond) is the UK&#x27;s national synchrotron light source science facility located at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. 

Its purpose is to produce intense beams of light whose special characteristics are useful in many areas of scientific research. In particular it can be used to investigate the structure and properties of a wide range of materials from proteins (to provide information for designing new and better drugs), and engineering components (such as a fan blade from an aero-engine) to conservation of archeological artifacts (for example Henry VIII&#x27;s flagship the Mary Rose).

There are more than 50 light sources across the world. With an energy of 3 GeV, Diamond is a medium energy synchrotron currently operating with 32 beamlines.

== Design, construction and finance ==

The Diamond synchrotron is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built in the UK since the Nimrod proton synchrotron which was sited at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in 1964. Nearby facilities include the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, the Central Laser Facility, and the laboratories at Harwell and Culham (including the Joint European Torus (JET) project). It replaced the Synchrotron Radiation Source, a second-generation synchrotron at the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire.

Diamond produced its first user beam towards the end of January 2007, and was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 October 2007.

===Construction===
A design study during the 1990s was completed in 2001 by scientists at Daresbury and construction began following the creation of the operating company, Diamond Light Source Ltd.

The construction costs of £260m covered the synchrotron building, the accelerators inside it, the first seven experimental stations (beamlines) and the adjacent office block, Diamond House.

===Governance===
The facility is operated by Diamond Light Source Ltd, a joint venture company established in March 2002. The company receives 86% of its funding from the UK Government via the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and 14% from the Wellcome Trust.

==Synchrotron==

Diamond generates synchrotron light at wavelengths ranging from X-rays to the far infrared. This is also known as synchrotron radiation and is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by charged particles travelling near the speed of light when their path deviates from a straight line. It is used in a huge variety of experiments to study the structure and behaviour of many different types of matter.

The particles Diamond uses are electrons travelling at an energy of 3 GeV round a 561.6 m circumference storage ring. This is not a true circle, but a 48-sided polygon with a bending magnet at each vertex and straight sections in between. The bending magnets are dipole magnets whose magnetic field deflects the electrons so as to steer them around the ring. As Diamond is a third generation light source it also uses special arrays of magnets called insertion devices. These cause the electrons to undulate and it is their sudden change of direction that causes the electrons to emit an exceptionally bright beam of electromagnetic radiation, brighter than that of a single bend when traveling through a bending magnet. This is the synchrotron light used for experiments. Some beamlines, however, use light solely from a bending magnet without the need of an insertion device.

The electrons reach this high energy via a series of pre-accelerator stages before being injected into the 3 GeV storage ring:
* an electron gun – 90 keV
* a 100 MeV linear accelerator
* a 100 MeV – 3 GeV booster synchrotron (158 m in circumference).

The Diamond synchrotron is housed in a silver toroidal building of 738 m in circumference, covering an area in excess of 43,300 square metres, or the area of over six football pitches. This contains the storage ring and a number of beamlines, with the linear accelerator and booster synchrotron housed in the centre of the ring. These beamlines are the experimental stations where the synchrotron light&#x27;s interaction with matter is used for research purposes. Seven beamlines were available when Diamond became operational in 2007, with more coming online as construction continued. As of April 2019 there were 32 beamlines in operation. Diamond is intended ultimately to host about 33 beamlines, supporting the life, physical and environmental sciences.

Diamond is also home to eleven electron microscopes. Nine of these are cryo-electron microscopes specialising in life sciences including two provided for industry use in partnership with Thermo Fisher Scientific; the remaining two microscopes are dedicated to research of advanced materials.

==Case studies==
* In September 2007, scientists from Cardiff University led by Tim Wess, found that the Diamond synchrotron could be used to see hidden content of ancient documents by illumination without opening them (penetrating layers of parchment).
* In November 2010 data collected at Diamond by Imperial College London formed the basis for a paper in the journal Nature advancing the understanding of how HIV and other retroviruses infect human and animal cells. The findings may enable improvements in gene therapy to correct gene malfunctions.
* In June 2011 data from Diamond led to an article in the journal Nature detailing the 3D structure of the human Histamine H1 receptor protein. This led to the development of &#x27;third generation&#x27; anti-histamines, drugs effective against some allergies without adverse side-effects.
* In December 2017, UK established the Synchrotron Techniques for African Research and Technology (START) with a £3.7 million funded by the UK Research and Innovation for 3 years. START aimed to provide access to African researchers with focus on energy materials and structural biology. The step is circuital for the inception of the first African Light Source.
*Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in April 2018, a five institution collaboration including scientists from Diamond used three of Diamond&#x27;s macromolecular beamlines to discover details of how a bacterium used plastic as an energy source. High resolution data allowed the researchers to determine the workings of an enzyme that degraded the plastic PET. Subsequently computational modelling was carried out to investigate and thus improve this mechanism.
*An article published in Nature in 2019 described how a worldwide multidisciplinary collaboration designed several ways to control metal nano-particles, including synthesis at a substantially reduced cost for use as catalysts for the production of everyday goods.
* Research conducted at Diamond Light Source in 2020 helped determine the atomic structure of SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.
* In 2023, Diamond Light Source scanned the Herculaneum papyri including scroll PHerc. Paris. 4 to facilitate non-invasive decipherment through machine learning.

<text>Willamette University is a private liberal arts college with locations in Salem and Portland, Oregon. Founded in 1842, it is the oldest college in the Western United States. Originally named the Oregon Institute, the school was an unaffiliated outgrowth of the Methodist Mission. The name was changed to Wallamet University in 1852, followed by the current spelling in 1870. Willamette founded the first medical school and law school in the Pacific Northwest in the second half of the 19th century.

The college is a member of the NCAA&#x27;s Division III Northwest Conference. Approximately 2,400 students are enrolled at Willamette between the graduate and undergraduate programs.

==History==
The college was founded as the Oregon Institute by the missionary Jason Lee, who had arrived in what was then known as the Oregon Country in 1834 and had founded the Indian Manual Labor Institute for the education of the local Native Americans. Lee requested additional support for his mission, and received 53 additional volunteers in 1839, who arrived on the ship &quot;Lausanne&quot;. After a series of meetings in Lee&#x27;s home, the by-laws were adopted and board of trustees elected and the institute was officially established on February 1, 1842. The Oregon Institute officially opened on August 13, 1844, with a total of five students and one teacher, Mrs. Chloe Clarke Willson. Lee served as the first President of the Board of Trustees, followed by David Leslie after Lee&#x27;s death in 1845. Leslie would serve until his death in 1869. The original purpose of the institute was the education of the missionaries&#x27; children.
The original building of the institute was a three-story frame structure first occupied in 1844. At the time, it was one of the largest structures in the Pacific Northwest. It housed the first session of the state legislature to meet in Salem after the capital was moved there in 1851. The building burned down in 1872. In 1867, a new brick building was finished to house the school and named University Hall. The building was renamed as Waller Hall in 1912 to honor the Reverend Alvin F. Waller, and is now the oldest university building west of the Mississippi River still in use. The first president was Francis S. Hoyt, who served in that position from 1853 until 1860 and was replaced by Thomas Milton Gatch who is the only president of the school to serve as president two different times.

The name of the institution was changed to &quot;Wallamet University&quot; in 1852. The following year, the Oregon Territorial Legislature granted a charter to the university. The first graduate was Emily J. York, who received a degree as Mistress of English Literature in 1859. In 1866, the university established the first school of medicine in the Pacific Northwest. The current spelling of the university was adopted in 1870. In 1883, the university established the first law school in the Pacific Northwest during the presidency of Thomas Van Scoy. The school of medicine then merged with the University of Oregon in 1913 and is now Oregon Health and Science University.

In December 1941, the institution&#x27;s football team traveled to Hawaii to play the University of Hawaii. Many students accompanied the team by passenger ship to Oahu. The game was played on December 6. The following day, many of the Willamette students witnessed the bombing of Pearl Harbor from their hotels on Waikiki Beach. Their return trip was delayed by many weeks, and some of the students returned to Oregon by helping on ships transporting the wounded to the mainland. Many of the team members stayed with football players from Punahou School.

During World War II, Willamette was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. Lausanne Hall, previously a women&#x27;s residence, served as a &quot;ship&quot; for trainees between 1943 and 1945.

In 1965, Willamette and the Tokyo International University entered a sister-college relationship. The Tokyo International University in America, on Willamette University&#x27;s campus, was completed in 1989.

Elizabeth Heaston, of the class of 1999, became the first female to play in a collegiate football game in 1997. In 2013, the Willamette community broke the world record for largest game of Red Light/Green Light with 1,060 players, and reclaimed the record in August, 2015, with 1,203 players.

In September 2020, Willamette announced that it would merge with the Pacific Northwest College of Art. It finalized the merger on June 30, 2021.

==Campus==
The Salem campus is directly south of the Oregon State Capitol, affording students access to internships in the institutions of Oregon government. Much of downtown Salem, including the Capitol, is on land once owned by the college. Railroad tracks are located directly east of the institution, with the Salem Amtrak Station near the southeastern edge of campus. South of the school is Salem Hospital, with Bush&#x27;s Pasture Park and the school&#x27;s McCulloch Stadium opposite the hospital.

Willamette&#x27;s core area in Salem lies between State Street on the north, Bellevue Street on the south, Winter Street to the west, and 12th Street on the east. On the west side of Winter Street lie the university&#x27;s graduate programs in business and law. Additional properties outside of the core area are the Hallie Ford Museum of Art, the Oregon Civic Justice Center, the Tokyo International University of America campus, and several residential buildings. Willamette owns several other properties along State Street west of the main campus. The institution plans to redevelop portions of the west end of campus to better tie the campus to downtown Salem.

Academic buildings on campus include Eaton Hall and Smullin/Walton Hall, which are primarily used by humanities departments. Science classes are generally held in the Collins and Olin buildings. Willamette&#x27;s music program is housed by the G. Herbert Smith Auditorium and Fine Arts building, as well as the Mary Stuart Rogers Music Center. Administrative offices are found in the Putnam University Center and Waller Hall, Willamette&#x27;s oldest building. Waller Hall was built using bricks made of clay from the campus quad. Willamette&#x27;s newest buildings, including the Goudy Commons, Kaneko Commons (a residential college opened in the Fall of 2006), and Rogers Music Center have all been designed by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects. Ford Hall, near Gatke Hall on State Street, is a new academic building completed in the Fall of 2009.

In addition to Greek housing, eleven residence halls exist on the Willamette campus. Undergraduate students are under contract to live on campus for two years, after which they may move into private residence or one of the university&#x27;s apartment complexes. Lausanne Hall, originally home of the university&#x27;s Women&#x27;s College, is now one of the university&#x27;s undergraduate dormitories. The building commemorates the ship that brought the reinforcements to Lee in 1839. York Hall commemorates the university&#x27;s first graduate.
The Mill Stream runs through the middle of the campus. Starting across 12th Street and flowing through the length of the campus, it passes by the Martha Springer Botanical Garden, the Hatfield Library, Hudson Hall, the University Center, Smith Auditorium and Goudy Commons. This artificial stream, commonly referred to as the Mill Stream, was once known as the Mill Race. It forms a &quot;W&quot; shape when viewed from the University Center. Biology and environmental science classes use the Mill Stream as an authentic research venue. As part of the freshman matriculation ceremony, new students place a lit candle into the Mill Stream and watch it float downstream.

On-campus athletics facilities are located in the southeast portion of the campus. These include a soccer field, tennis courts, and the Sparks Center. Softball, football, and baseball stadiums are located outside of the main campus.

==Academics==
===Undergraduate admissions===
For the Class of 2026 (enrolling fall 2022), Willamette received 3,993 applications, admitted 3,218, and enrolled 537 students. For the freshmen who enrolled, the average high school weighted grade point average was 3.96.

For the 2022–2023 academic year, tuition, housing, and fee charges were $65,047. Willamette awarded about $30.2 million in need-based aid to its students in 2015, with the average financial aid package equal to $35,204. In terms of merit-based aid, the majority of Willamette scholarships and grants are awarded to students with demonstrated financial need.

Willamette University is a Common Application-exclusive school and is test-optional. All students who apply for admission are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships, which start at $22,000 per year. The university accepts the FAFSA to determine financial aid packages.

===Programs and resources===
The institution&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences offers 35 majors, six minors and seven special programs, including pre-law, pre-med and a BA/MBA program. The most popular undergraduate majors, by number out of 393 graduates in 2022, were:
*Economics (40)
*Psychology (33)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (30)
*Environmental Science (28)
*Political Science and Government (24)
*Exercise Science and Kinesiology (23)

Learning takes place both in and outside of the classroom. For example, students earn credit as political interns at the Oregon State Capitol, across the street from campus; study the effects of climate change at the nearby research forest; or conduct epidemiology surveys for the local health department.

Students in service-learning courses base papers and projects on their community service experience, and more than half of Willamette&#x27;s undergraduate students study abroad, choosing from programs in 40 countries. Co-located with Tokyo International University of America, Willamette offers opportunities for students interested in Japanese language and culture, and connections to Asia and the Pacific Rim.

Carson Grants offer undergraduates the opportunity to undertake a scholarly, creative, or professional research project during the summer, and the Lilly Project provides grants, internships and programs to help students discern their &quot;calling in life&quot; and create meaningful professional paths. Sustainability mini-grants also provide students with opportunities to initiate contributions to campus sustainability efforts. Five academic Centers of Excellence provide opportunities for student-faculty collaboration and research. Eleven faculty members have been named Oregon Professor of the Year by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) since 1990.

===Graduate programs===

Located on the western side of the campus are the university&#x27;s two graduate level schools. The College of Law is the oldest and largest of the programs, with the Atkinson Graduate School of Management being smaller and newer. The College of Education at Willamette closed in 2014. Atkinson and the College of Law offer a joint-degree program that allows students to earn both an MBA and Juris Doctor.

==Campus life==

The institution&#x27;s weekly newspaper, the &quot;Willamette Collegian&quot;, began publishing in 1875. It also has over 100 student organizations ranging from sport clubs, political groups, and social clubs to religious groups and honor societies. Willamette University has many active club and intramural sports on its campus, including rugby, poi spinning, ultimate frisbee, basketball, and others. The Outdoor Program organizes around 120 trips each year, and more than half of students participate in trips like kayaking, camping, skiing, hiking, whale-watching, and more.

===Greek life===
There are two fraternities and two sororities at Willamette. The sororities are Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Phi. The fraternities are Kappa Sigma and Sigma Chi.

Greek life at Willamette began in the 1920s. In 1942, G. Herbert Smith, a member of Beta Theta Pi, became President of Willamette, and invited more fraternities and sororities onto campus. Pi Beta Phi became the first national sorority at Willamette in 1944, and Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Delta Theta were installed in 1947.

Chi Omega was transformed into a multicultural oriented residence known as WISH (Willamette International Studies House). Pi Beta Phi closed in 2021. In the spring of 2014, Alpha Phi accepted an invitation from the university&#x27;s Panhellenic Council to reorganize their chapter on Willamette&#x27;s campus. In the fall of 2014, Beta Theta Pi began recolonization of its chapter on Willamette&#x27;s campus with the consent of the university&#x27;s Inter-Fraternity council.

Greek life at Willamette came under national scrutiny in 2013 when Facebook messages from one fraternity, Sigma Chi, were leaked. The messages were sexist in nature and included demands for Sigma Chi brothers to &quot;invite any girl who has a pulse&quot; to an upcoming party and that &quot;women&#x27;s [sic] rights are the biggest joke in the US.&quot; The messages included sexually threatening language about a Willamette administrator. The fraternity lost its house and was forced to move off campus. Sigma Chi&#x27;s National Executive Director Mike Dunn said that the fraternity &quot;completely support[s] what the school has done.&quot; Twelve members of the fraternity were punished by being forced to leave the group. In the aftermath, &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; ranked Sigma Chi at Willamette fifth on its list of &quot;The Most Out of Control Fraternities in America&quot;.

==Athletics==
The Willamette University Bearcats compete at the NCAA Division III level. Willamette fields teams in baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, football, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, lacrosse and volleyball. In 2021, Willamette will begin the first women&#x27;s varsity triathlon program in the Pacific Northwest and the 23rd program nationally.

Willamette is a founding member of the Northwest Conference league. The football team plays home games at McCulloch Stadium south of the main campus, while basketball, swimming, and volleyball teams use the Lestle J. Sparks Center for home events. At or adjacent to McCulloch are the Charles Bowles Track used for track meets and Roy S. &quot;Spec&quot; Keene Stadium where baseball plays its home games. 

In 1991, the institution started the Willamette University Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1993, the school earned its only team sport national championship when the men&#x27;s basketball team earned the NAIA Division 2 title.

===Notable athletes===
As an undergraduate, Olympian Nick Symmonds won the 800 NCAA championship race all four years and the 1,500 NCAA championship race as a freshman, junior, and senior. Symmonds later went on to place fifth in the 800-meter run at the 2012 Olympic Games.

In 2007, Sarah Zerzan won the NCAA Division III title in cross country.

In 1997, Liz Heaston became the first woman to ever play in a college football game when the Bearcats beat rival Linfield College. She kicked two extra points in the game. Also that year, the football team finished its best season losing in the NAIA National Championship game to the University of Findlay 14–7.

In 2014, Conner Mertens became the first active college football player to come out about his bisexuality. Mertens generated international headlines when he publicly addressed being bisexual.

In 2017, the Willamette Men&#x27;s Soccer team won their first NCAA division III title.

On Dec. 7, 1941, Willamette&#x27;s football team was in Honolulu, Hawaii, for the Shrine Bowl when Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor. Team members and fans who had made the trip volunteered for 10 days following the attack as guards at Punahou School and nurses at the U.S. Navy hospital. The 1941 team, known today on Willamette&#x27;s campus as &quot;the Pearl Harbor Football Team,&quot; was inducted into the Willamette University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997.

<text>A games table desk is an antique desk form which has a writing surface etched or veneered in the pattern of a given board game. It also provides sufficient storage space for writing implements and a separate space for storing game accessories such as counters. It is often called a &quot;games table&quot; or game table, which leads to confusion with pieces of furniture (antique or modern) which are built specifically for gaming only, with no intention or provision for use as a desk.

== History ==
With the gradual creation of specialized rooms in the homes of the nobility and of the richer members of society during the 18th century, specialized furniture followed. Instead of having large halls which could be transformed quickly into a dining room, ballroom, or audience chamber (thanks to big, sturdy transportable furniture), the trend now was towards a large number of smaller rooms in which smaller and more delicate specialized furniture stayed in permanence.

Just before the French Revolution furniture out-specialized itself. Only the extremely rich could afford to have items of furniture for every possible activity: a dresser for cosmetics, a commode for toiletry, a lady&#x27;s desk for writing during most of the year and a lady&#x27;s Fire screen desk for cold evenings, equivalent desks for the gentleman, a game table for chess, another one for checkers, a billiards table, and so on. This is when furniture giving dual use or triple use became popular among those who were merely rich and could not afford having cabinet makers constantly making new items for their homes. One of the most popular of these combinations was the games table desk.

=== Variations ===

The games table desk has a great variety of forms. Like most of the desks of that period it was built on commission to whatever new design, or modification of an old design, the customer might want. Most of them have in common a double-sided top, covered on one side with a gaming board and on the other side with tooled leather or some other material suitable for placing paper on it and writing with a quill. The top board is sometimes attached loosely and sometimes very securely to the main body of the desk, and it is sometimes hinged. Some desks have not one but several top boards, kept stacked on one another, each having a different board game design on it.

<doc id="436083" wikidata="Q1537299" url="?curid=436083" title="University of South Carolina System">
<text>The University of South Carolina System is a state university system collection of campuses established in 1957 to expand the educational opportunities of the citizens of South Carolina as well as extend the reach of the University of South Carolina (USC) throughout the state. With over 52,000 students at the eight campuses, the system is the largest institution of higher learning in the state of South Carolina.

The system includes the flagship research campus in Columbia, South Carolina, three senior campuses, and four regional campuses. USC has several thousand future students in feeder programs at surrounding technical colleges.

==Campuses==
The University of South Carolina system currently consists of eight campuses with a flagship campus at Columbia. The campuses in Aiken, Beaufort and Spartanburg are Comprehensive campuses and offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The four Palmetto Colleges are regional campuses and offer associate&#x27;s degree as well as providing a straightforward process to transfer to one of the senior campuses through the university&#x27;s on-line Palmetto College.

Four of the campuses have branches in nearby locales. USC Beaufort has a branch in Bluffton, USC Union has a branch in Laurens, USC Salkehatchie has its main campus in Allendale with a branch in Walterboro, and USC Upstate has a branch in Greenville.

;Notes:
===Former campuses===
* USC Florence, a campus from 1957 until it became independent on July 1, 1970 as Francis Marion College (now Francis Marion University).
* USC Coastal Carolina, a previously independent two-year campus, joined the USC System in 1959 and remained until it became independent on July 1, 1993 as Coastal Carolina University.

==Governance==
The University of South Carolina System is governed by the Board of Trustees which oversees the overall management of the system. The Board of Trustees is composed of a total of 20 members. Of the members, 16 are chosen by the General Assembly, three are &quot;ex officio&quot; members, and one is appointed by the Governor of South Carolina.

A President is appointed by the board to serve as the chief executive officer of the system and to manage with the day-to-day affairs of the campuses. In addition, the President is tasked with long-range planning of the system and recommending improvements to the Board of Trustees. Each senior campus is administered by a chancellor and each regional campus is managed by a dean, all of whom report directly to the president. The duties of the chancellor at the Columbia campus are encompassed by the office of the president.

Both the Board of the Trustees and the president have offices in the Osborne Administration Building, at the northeast corner of The Horseshoe. The Board of Trustees meets every other month and the president delivers a yearly state-of-the-university address in the Longstreet Theater.

==Board of trustees==

&quot;Note: This article was transferred from the University of South Carolina article which pertains only to the Columbia campus, since the Board of Trustees governs the whole system.&quot;

The Board of Trustees is a body created by the state of South Carolina responsible for the maintenance and operation of the university, including the University of South Carolina System. Its primary focus is to set the mission for the University system and to approve all financial decisions.

The board was established in the legislation passed by the General Assembly on December 19, 1801 for the foundation of South Carolina College. The original board was composed of twenty-five members, twelve of whom were &quot;ex officio&quot; and 13 were elected. They first met on February 12, 1802 at the home of Governor John Drayton. A quorum was not present so they met again on February 14 when they did have the necessary numbers for a quorum.

On May 7, 1970 about 500 students marched to the flagpole on the Horseshoe and demanded that the U.S. Flag be lowered to half staff to honor those who had died in the Kent State shootings. An equal size counter-protest gathered at the flagpole and demanded that flag remain hoisted at the top of the pole. To thwart off any potential bloodshed, President Tom Jones ordered that the flag be lowered. However, the protesters felt emboldened and took over the Russell House. The National Guard had to be called in to dislodge the students from the building and 42 students were arrested.

The board acted to discipline the students on May 11. A crowd of 300 students formed, marched on the administrative building where the trustees were meeting, and demanded amnesty for the students. The board refused and the protesters responded by vandalizing cars parked at the building. One car that was flipped over was bought the same day by a trustee. The protesters occupied the first floor of the building causing the trustees to huddle in a room on the second floor. After waiting a few hours in the room, Hugh Willcox, a trustee in his 70s, simply left the room, walked past the students, and sped away in his car. Sol Blatt, Jr. commented that he would not have done that for $100,000. The National Guard arrived later that night and the protesters dispersed at their sight. The inability of President Tom Jones to control the actions of the students led to the loss of support by the trustees and his eventual resignation in 1974.

===Composition and powers===
The Board of Trustees is composed of the following 20 members:
*Governor of South Carolina, &quot;ex officio&quot; Chairman of the Board; may appoint a designee in his/her stead
*South Carolina State Superintendent of Education, &quot;ex officio&quot;
*President of the Greater University of South Carolina Alumni Association, &quot;ex officio&quot;
*One member elected by the General Assembly from each of the sixteen judicial circuits
*One member appointed by the governor

The governor&#x27;s appointee and those elected by the General Assembly serve for a term of four years.

Seven standing committees have been set up to streamline the business of the board of trustees. A special or ad hoc committee can be formed by the Chairman of the Board should a need arise. The following are the seven standing committees:

*Executive Committee
*Buildings and Grounds Committee
*Intercollegiate Activities Committee
*Academic Affairs and Faculty-Liaison Committee
*Student-Trustee Liaison Committee
*Health Affairs Committee
*Fiscal Policy Committee

Up until 1981, the positions of head football coach and athletic director were combined. Despite being the athletic director, the head football coach held little sway over the hiring and firing of the coaches for the other athletic programs. The true power lay with the chairman of the athletic committee and the position was dominated from the 1930s to the 1970s by Solomon Blatt, Sr. and his son Solomon Blatt, Jr. Yet in 1966 Blatt, Jr. was trumped when he had lined up Bill Murray to become the head football coach and Governor Robert Evander McNair had instead convinced Paul Dietzel to accept the position.

The trustees have the final say on all affairs that are pertinent to the University. Their powers include:
*Awarding of honorary degrees
*Purchasing, leasing and selling property of the University
*Setting tuition fees
*Hiring and firing faculty and personnel

Additionally, according to the Code of Laws of South Carolina (1976), Section 59-117-100, the board of trustees are tasked with ensuring that the president of the university is not an atheist or an infidel.

<doc id="436088" wikidata="Q677589" url="?curid=436088" title="Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein">
<text>Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (Frederick Christian Charles Augustus; 22 January 1831 – 28 October 1917) was a German prince who became a member of the British royal family through his marriage to Princess Helena of the United Kingdom, the fifth child and third daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

==Early life==
Prince Christian was born in Augustenburg Palace, as the second son of Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and his wife, Countess Louise Sophie of Danneskiold-Samsøe.

In 1848, young Christian&#x27;s father, Duke Christian August, placed himself at the head of a movement to resist by force the claims of Denmark upon the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, two personal possessions of the kings of Denmark, of which Holstein also was a part of the German Confederation. A year earlier, King Frederick VII acceded to the Danish throne without any hope of producing a male heir. Unlike Denmark proper, where the &quot;Lex Regia&quot; of 1665 allowed the throne to pass through the female royal line, in Holstein Salic Law prevailed. The duchy would most likely revert to the line of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, the cadet branch of the House of Holstein-Sonderburg. During the 1852 First War of Schleswig, Prince Christian briefly served with the newly constituted Schleswig-Holstein army, before he and his family were forced to flee the advancing Danish forces (see history of Schleswig-Holstein). After the war, he attended the University of Bonn, where he befriended Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia (later the German Emperor Frederick III).

==Marriage==
In September 1865, while visiting Coburg, The Princess Helena met Prince Christian. The couple became engaged in December of that year. Queen Victoria gave her permission for the marriage with the provision that the couple live in Great Britain. They married at the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle on 5 July 1866. Seven days before the wedding, on 29 June 1866, the Queen granted her future son-in-law the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; by Royal Warrant.

In 1891, Prince Christian lost an eye when he was accidentally shot in the face by his brother-in-law, the Duke of Connaught, during a shooting party at Sandringham.

Prince and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, as they were known, made their home at Frogmore House in the grounds of Windsor Castle and later at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park. They had six children, known commonly as:
* Prince Christian Victor (14 April 1867 – 29 October 1900); never married; died young during military duty and was buried in South Africa.
* Prince Albert (28 February 1869 – 27 April 1931) who in 1921 became the titular Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and the Head of the House of Oldenburg. Never married; but had an illegitimate daughter:
** Valerie Marie zu Schleswig-Holstein (3 April 1900 – 14 Aug 1953). Married firstly Ernst Johann Wagner (b. 10 Jan 1896); married secondly Engelbert-Charles, 16th Duke of Aarschot and 10th Duke of Arenberg (20 April 1899 – 27 April 1974), Head of the (formerly Sovereign) House of Arenberg
* Princess Helena Victoria (3 May 1870 – 13 March 1948); never married.
* Princess Marie Louise (12 August 1872 – 8 December 1956); married in 1891 Prince Aribert of Anhalt, regent of the Duchy of Anhalt, no issue, marriage annulled in 1900.
* Prince Harald (12 May 1876 – 20 May 1876).
* Unnamed stillborn son (born and died 7 May 1877).

==Honours and offices==
===Orders and decorations===

===Military and civil appointments===
Prince Christian was given the rank of major general in the British Army in July 1866 and received promotions to the ranks of lieutenant general in August 1874 and general in October 1877. From 1869 until his death, he was honorary colonel of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, The Royal Berkshire Regiment. However, he never held a major field command or staff position. He was High Steward of Windsor and Ranger of Windsor Great Park, and was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law degree by the University of Oxford.

He received the freedom of the city of Carlisle on 7 July 1902, during a visit to the city for the Royal Agricultural Society&#x27;s Show. As a &quot;Minor Royal&quot;, he officiated at many public functions. These included participation, with the Princess Helena, in the speech day of Malvern College in 1870. 

== The unpopularity of Prince Christian==
Prince Christian has the following written description:

==Death==
Prince Christian died at Schomberg House (half of which is now part of the Oxford and Cambridge Club), Pall Mall, London, in October 1917, in his eighty-sixth year. After being initially interred in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, he was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore in Windsor Great Park.

<text>Grandview Park, also referred to as Turtle Hill by local residents, is a small, elevated park in the Sunset District, San Francisco, California. It is surrounded by 14th and 15th Avenues, as well as Noriega Street.

Despite its small size, or about the size of a city block, the park is important geologically and botanically and offers views of downtown San Francisco, Golden Gate Park, to the Pacific Ocean, the Marin headlands, and across to the Sutro Tower.

The summit of Grandview Park rises to about . It is an outcrop of chert, which is part of the heterogeneous assemblage known as the Franciscan Formation, or Franciscan Assemblage, the primary geologic feature on which the city of San Francisco is founded, here covered with a thin layer of sand. It provides one of the last remaining habitats within the city for a number of native plants, including the endangered Franciscan wallflower and dune tansy, and also bush lupin, beach strawberry, bush monkey flower, and coyote bush. The hill is crowned with Monterey cypress trees.

Because of the fragility of the environment, visitors to the park are asked to keep to paths.

The 16th Avenue Tiled Steps lead up to the park.

<text>The Burdekin River is a river in North and Far North Queensland, Australia. The river rises on the northern slopes of Boulder Mountain at Valley of Lagoons, part of the western slope of the Seaview Range, and flows into the Coral Sea at Upstart Bay over to the southeast of the source, with a catchment area of approximately . The Burdekin River is Australia&#x27;s largest river by (peak) discharge volume.

The river was first encountered by Europeans during the expedition led by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845 and named in honour of Thomas Burdekin, one of the sponsors of the expedition.

==Course and features==
The Burdekin River rises on the western slopes of the Seaview Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, west of . In the river&#x27;s upper catchment, from its source the river generally flows west and then south out of the Girringun National Park, part of the UNESCO Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. This area, now part of Basalt was the location of one of the earliest inland settlements in northern Australia and was known as Dalrymple. The river is joined by Lucy Creek, the Running River, Star River and Keelbottom Creek, above . From the west in the Dry Tropics to the west of the river, the river is joined by the Clarke, Basalt and Dry rivers. South of Charters Towers, the upper catchment of the Burdekin River is joined by the Fanning River, and then continues to flow south through wetlands before entering Lake Dalrymple, the reservoir created by the Burdekin Falls Dam.

Within Lake Dalrymple, the Burdekin River is joined by the Cape, Suttor/Belyando rivers. The source of the Belyando River in central western Queensland is almost from the mouth of the Burdekin River, and extends into the typical black-soil grassland of Central Queensland, with the Belyando draining the Drummond and Galilee Basins and flowing north for over .

Below the dam wall, in the river&#x27;s lower catchment, is northern Australia&#x27;s largest irrigation area with approximately under irrigation, predominantly for growing sugarcane. It consists of two broad regions, the earlier established delta region located on the coarse sedimentary deposits of the Burdekin River Delta, a groundwater dominated scheme, and the Burdekin Haughton Water Supply Scheme (BHWSS) – a more recently developed surface water dominated scheme on alluvial floodplains of the Burdekin River. Here the Burdekin is joined by the Bowen and Bogie rivers.

The Burdekin River descends over its course.

Four DIWA wetlands can be found along the course of the river. The first is at the Valley of Lagoons in the upper region of the catchment, the next is a Lake Dalrymple, then at the junction of the Burdekin and Bowen rivers known as the Burdekin-Bowen Junction and Blue Valley Weir Aggregation and the last is at the river delta which forms a wetland.

The Burdekin River is one of the most economically important rivers in Australia, and has the fourth-largest watershed of any exorheic drainage system in Australia. It is also the fourth-largest river in Australia by volume of flow, but is so erratic that its discharge can reach the mean discharge of the Yangtze River (after two severe cyclones in 1958) or have as many as seven months with &quot;no flow&quot; whatsoever (as in 1923). This exceedingly erratic flow is due to the extreme variability of precipitation throughout the entire basin. Annual rainfall at most gauges within the basin can range from depending on the monsoon and the number of cyclones that cross the coast. On the coast itself, the variability is even higher: at Bowen not far from the river&#x27;s mouth, the annual rainfall has ranged from in 1915 to over in 1950. It has the highest mean annual flow for any river adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.

==History==


&quot;Gugu Badhun&quot; (also known as &quot;Koko-Badun&quot; and &quot;Kokopatun&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Charters Towers Region, particularly the localities of Greenvale and the Valley of Lagoons, and in the Upper Burdekin River area and in Abergowrie.

Yuru (also known as &quot;Juru, Euronbba, Juru, Mal Mal, Malmal&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuru country. The Yuru language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Burdekin, including the town of Home Hill.&quot;&quot;

The river was first discovered by Europeans by John Clements Wickham aboard in 1839 who named it the Wickham River. In 1849, Ludwig Leichhardt named the river after Thomas Burdekin, one of the sponsors of Leichhardt&#x27;s expedition. Because he was inland away from the coast he was not aware it was the same watercourse named by Wickham. The town of Wickham was established on Rita Island at the river mouth but was soon swept away during a flood in the 1860s.

Pastoralists had established runs along the river during the 1860s, with some along the lower reached taken for selection in the 1880s.

In 1899, the Burdekin River Rail Bridge was built over the river about 24 km NE of Charters Towers to carry the Great Northern railway. Although replaced by a new bridge in 1964, the old bridge remains and is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

The townships of Ayr and Brandon were established in 1882 with many sugarmills being erected. The North Coast railway between Ayr and Townsville had the Inkerman Bridge over the Burdekin River from McDesme to Home Hill which was built in 1913 followed by bridge for road traffic in 1930. Both were too low and often damaged during flooding and the decision was made to replace them with a higher dual level bridge known as the Silver Link. Construction commenced in 1947 and was not completed until 1957 when the bridge opened.

A weir was constructed in a gorge in the Leichhardt Range for settlement farms near Clare and Dalbeg in 1953 for growing tobacco. In 1984 construction of the Burdekin Falls Dam commenced and was completed by 1987 when the dam started to fill forming Lake Dalrymple.

===Floods===

Floods events occur on average from no floods to three per year between December and March.

Heavy flooding occurred in 1875 with the Dawson, Fitzroy, Mary and Burdekin Rivers rising up to in a few hours. The waters washed away dwellings, fencing and livestock and effects downstream included the loss of the steamer which was unable to steer effectively and ran aground on a reef at the entrance of Flinders Channel.

In 1917 more severe flooding occurred with the bridge at Inkerman under of water and the one at Ayr over underwater after a day of flooding. Approximately one third of the Inkerman Bridge was later washed away by the floodwaters.

Further flooding occurred in 1927 with waters running nearly over the Inkerman Bridge and over the Burdekin Bridge, the river reached its peak at above summer levels at Sellheim.

During the 1974 flood event associated with Cyclone Wanda, which lasted from 17 December 1973 to 23 April 1974, an estimated mass discharge peak of of water per second was reached, which affected of coastline and created a plume with widths ranging from .

==Water storage==

The Burdekin Falls Dam, the largest dam in Queensland was constructed west of Ayr and Home Hill and completed in 1987 to form what is also known as Lake Dalrymple.

As part of the proposed Bradfield Scheme the upper Burdekin River was to be used to feed water by gravity westwards to the upper reaches of the Flinders River.

===Irrigation===
On the lower Burdekin floodplain an irrigation area was established in the early 1950s. At first only Gorge Weir and Blue Valley Weir provided water to the scheme, until the 1970s when Eungella Dam also provided water. Water is also drawn from the Haughton River. Major pump stations are located at Clare Weir feeding water to both sides of the river. An area of is irrigated.

In the delta around Ayr and Home Hill, groundwater is used extensively to irrigate crops of sugar cane. This groundwater is recharged artificially during the extreme flood events that occasionally occur, usually due to a La Niña event. The use of groundwater in the floodplain is carefully managed so that supply can be maintained during the dry season and to prevent saltwater intrusion.

==Watershed==
The North Coast railway line crosses the river at Home Hill, via a bridge constructed in 1913. At the same location the Bruce Highway traverses the river via the Burdekin Bridge. Further west, the river is crossed by the Flinders Highway.

Although on paper most of the basin of the Burdekin appears perfect for rainfed crops like cotton and maize, in fact the rainfall is so erratic that in almost every year a would-be farmer will experience either too little or too much rain for the crop to mature properly. Thus, most of the basin of the Burdekin can be used only for low-density grazing of sheep and cattle, since grazing is less likely to be damaged economically and ecologically by the extreme risks of an extraordinarily erratic climate.

The Valley of Lagoons Station was established in 1862 after the area in the upper reaches of the Burdekin was opened up by the government. Initially stocked with sheep, the property was later used to raise cattle. In 1864, Inkerman Station was established toward the lower reaches, where the town of Inkerman now stands. The area was plagued by cattle tick, so the government acquired the property in 1910 and sold it off as farmland where sugarcane was later grown.

The natural vegetation away from the coast is a grassland dominated by perennial Mitchell and annual Flinders grasses. Near the coast there are patches of dry eucalypt forest on the typically infertile laterised soils characteristic of most of Australia.

Few mines exist along the waterway, with the notable exception of the Ben Lomond Uranium mine which is situated approximately west of Townsville. The mine is currently dormant, but in 1981 the mine discharged toxic waste containing unacceptable levels of radioactivity, when its tailing dam overflowed into a creek that feeds into the Burdekin.

==Wildlife==
&quot;Neosilurus mollespiculum&quot; is a species of eeltail catfish endemic to the Burdekin. Many other species such as Agassiz&#x27;s glassfish, Irwin&#x27;s turtle, banded grunter, barramundi, black catfish, eastern rainbowfish, empire gudgeon, freshwater longtom, mangrove jack, tilapia and yellowbelly are found throughout the catchment.

<text>HMAS &quot;Burnie&quot; (J198/B238/A112), named for the city of Burnie, Tasmania, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot; class corvettes constructed during World War II and one of 20 built for the Admiralty but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Entering RAN service in April 1941, &quot;Burnie&quot; saw action during World War II, and was decommissioned on 5 July 1946. The corvette was sold to the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) five days later, was renamed HNLMS &quot;Ceram&quot;, and remained in service until 1958.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to be fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Burnie&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Burnie&quot; was laid down by Mort&#x27;s Dock &amp; Engineering Company, Sydney on 4 June 1940. The corvette was launched on 25 October 1940 by Lady King, wife of the Mort&#x27;s Dock Chairman of Directors, and was commissioned into the RAN on 15 April 1941.

==Operational history==

===Royal Australian Navy===

====Australia and Singapore====
&quot;Burnie&quot; was initially assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla, which she joined on 10 May 1941. The ship was then temporarily based at Fremantle, Western Australia as a patrol ship and convoy escort, then was sent to Sydney. In June, &quot;Burnie&quot; and sister ship HMAS &quot;Goulburn&quot; were assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s China Force, and sailed to Singapore via the east coast of Australia, arriving on 12 July. There Burnie with HMAS&quot; Goulburn&quot;, and composed the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla assigned to minesweeping, patrol and escort duties. &quot;Burnie&quot; was present in Singapore when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and invaded Malaya.

====Collapse of Java====
The corvette was involved in a series of actions delaying the Japanese advance through Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies, including anti-submarine patrol, demolition work, troop and civilian evacuation, and anti-aircraft engagements, both individually and in concert with other Allied ships. During this time, she was involved in the evacuation of Sumatra in mid-February 1942, and, with &quot;Bendigo&quot;, rescued survivors from the Dutch vessel on 28 February from the beach at Java Head. During the final days the ship was flagship for Commodore Collins commanding the China Force. This continued until September 1942, when &quot;Burnie&quot; was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet for anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean.

Along with &quot;Goulburn&quot; the ship had left Singapore on 25 January assigned to sweep the southern half of Banka Strait arriving in Batavia 30 January and on finding the harbor congested were at Tanjung Priok by 2 February where &quot;Burnie&quot; and &quot;Goulburn&quot; began on 5 February a continuous anti-submarine patrol until the Japanese invasion of Java. By 12 February and a flood of ships fleeing the fall of Singapore and Japanese advances the ship was sent to Oosthaven in Sumatra for anti-submarine patrols at that port. On the 17th the ship entered the port with to assist in demolition of facilities covering a bridge to the wharf with her gun while a shore party worked through the night destroying ammunition, rail equipment and placing depth charges under the KPM wharf and a cargo shed as well as pouring sulphuric acid into the working parts and destroying propellers of four trucks of torpedoes before &quot;Burnie&quot; got underway and completed destruction with gunfire.

On the morning of 19 February the ship arrived at Tanjung Priok where her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander T. Christy, RANR(S), reported to Commodore Collins and received orders to take temporary command of and, with a party of Royal Air Force personnel return in &quot;Ballarat&quot; to Oosthaven for salvage of air force material. With that mission accomplished Christy returned in &quot;Ballarat&quot; on 21 February, the date when the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command had cabled Winston Churchill that further efforts to hold Java and the purpose of the command itself were useless. Withdrawal from Java began and on 22 February &quot;Ballarat&quot;, &quot;Bendigo&quot;, &quot;Burnie&quot; and &quot;Maryborough&quot; replaced coal burning ships in the Sunda Strait Auxiliary Patrol established by Collins to prevent Japanese landings on Java from Sumatra with night crossings in small craft.

By the 27th all British ships were ordered withdrawn from the Sunda Strait area and all the ships of 21st Minesweeping Flotilla were short of fuel with the flotilla commander ordering withdrawal to Tjilatjap for fueling on 28 February but &quot;Bendigo&quot; and &quot;Burnie&quot; were detached to rescue a party seen signaling from Java Head. On reaching the site &quot;Bendigo&quot; picked up fifteen and &quot;Burnie&quot; twenty-nine people that were survivors of the Dutch ship &quot;Boero&quot; that had been torpedoed several days earlier. Meanwhile, the flotilla had been ordered to return to Sunda Strait but the two ships with survivors were ordered on to Tjilatjap.

On 1 March, with the two ships and survivors approaching Tjilatjap the withdrawal from Batavia was ordered and all British ships were to gather at Tjilatjap for evacuation. By the time the two corvettes arrived on the afternoon of 1 March Japanese forces were already south of the port and &quot;Bendigo&quot; broadcast a message from Commodore Collins that all ships with enough fuel to avoid that port should proceed directly to Fremantle or Colombo. During the evening Collins arrived from Batavia and boarded &quot;Burnie&quot;. Evacuees were loaded on all ships available in the port and at 8 p.m. on 2 March &quot;Burnie&quot; departed flying Collins&#x27; flag and reaching Fremantle on 8 March after narrowly escaping Admiral Kondō&#x27;s cruisers that sunk , the first of the British ships that left Tjilatjap, , and .

====Eastern Fleet====
&quot;Burnie&quot; remained with the Eastern Fleet until December 1944, when she and the other Admiralty-controlled Australian corvettes were ordered to Sydney, formed up as a Minesweeping Flotilla, and attached to the British Pacific Fleet. The corvette was primarily used as a patrol ship and convoy escort in the waters of New Guinea, the Admiralty Islands, and the Philippines.

After World War II ended in August 1945, &quot;Burnie&quot; was ordered to Hong Kong, where she was involved in mine clearance operations. By November, she had returned to Australian waters, and during December 1945 and January 1946 was involved in several public relations activities, including a visit to her namesake town and a cruise for children in Port Phillip Bay. The corvette&#x27;s wartime service was recognised with three battle honours: &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–44&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

===Royal Netherlands Navy service===
Following the end of World War II, all of the Admiralty-operated &quot;Bathurst&quot; class corvettes were earmarked for disposal. &quot;Burnie&quot;, along with sister ships &quot;Ipswich&quot; and &quot;Toowoomba&quot;, were slated for transfer to the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN). The three corvettes departed Brisbane on 4 June 1946, arriving in Ceylon a month and a day later. The three ships were paid off from RAN service and commissioned into the RNLN; &quot;Burnie&quot; being renamed HNLMS &quot;Ceram&quot;

&quot;Ceram&quot; remained in service with the RNLN until 1958, when she was removed from the active service list.

<text>Burnie ( ; pirinilaplu/palawa kani: &quot;pataway&quot;) is a port city located on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Australia. It is the fourth largest city on the island, located approximately north-west of the state capital of Hobart, north-west of Launceston, and west of Devonport. Founded in 1827 as Emu Bay, the township was renamed in the early 1840s after William Burnie, a director of the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company,
and proclaimed a city by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 April 1988.
As of the , Burnie has a population of 19,918, with a municipality area spanning , administered by the City of Burnie.

Burnie&#x27;s economy has historically been driven by heavy manufacturing, mining, forestry, and farming.
Situated on the coastline of Emu Bay, the city’s fortunes are closely tied to its deep water port. An intermodal freight transport facility, the Port of Burnie handles over of freight annually, including nearly half of Tasmania&#x27;s containerised freight. As Tasmania&#x27;s most north-westerly city, it provides the shortest sea lines of communication between mainland Tasmania and mainland Australia.
The city is a key exporter of Tasmanian minerals, including copper, silver, gold, tin, lead, zinc, iron, tungsten, and ultra-high purity silica, alongside forestry products such as logs, pulpwood, and wood chips. The Burnie Chip Export Terminal, often referred to as the &quot;Pyramids of Burnie&quot;, surpassed of annual wood chip exports in 2017.

During the 1970s and 80s, Burnie faced pollution challenges linked to titanium dioxide production.
From the 1990s, the city experienced significant industrial decline, with the closure of several manufacturing plants and the eventual shutdown of its pulp and paper mill.
This downturn led to population decline and high unemployment, presenting economic hardships and uncertainty for the community.

In recent years, Burnie has been positioning itself as a future leader in Tasmania’s renewable energy sector. By 2024, the city is set to be a key player in the proposed North West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), a project designed to foster investment in large-scale wind and solar energy developments. The Marinus Link, a high-voltage direct current submarine power cable, is also planned to connect Tasmania’s renewable energy supply to mainland Australia, potentially generating 1,400 local jobs and bringing an estimated $3 billion in economic investment. Current proposals for the region include the Guildford and Hellyer Wind Farms, as well as Australia’s first synthetic electrofuel facility. Other growing sectors in Burnie include education, healthcare, and logistics, contributing to its economic diversification.

==History==
===Early history (1827–1875)===
Burnie&#x27;s history is closely tied to the establishment of the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company (VDL Company) in the early 19th century. In 1824, a group of wool merchants, bankers, investors, and woollen mill owners gathered in London to explore the idea of creating a land company in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, following the model of the Australian Agricultural Company in the Colony of New South Wales. With backing from William Sorell, a former lieutenant governor, and Edward Curr, who had recently returned from the colony, they established the VDL Company, with William Burnie its inaugural Governor of Company. They applied to Lord Bathurst for a grant of , while Bathurst approved a smaller allotment of , the company received a Royal Charter in 1825, giving it broad authority to cultivate land, and build housing and wharves to support colonial development within a area in North-West Tasmania.

Oakleigh Park, close to Burnie’s business centre, is the birthplace of Burnie and the cradle of the northwest coast. In 1827, chief surveyor of the VDL Company, Henry Hellyer, camped beside Whalebone Creek there. With approval from the Company’s chief agent, Edward Curr, Hellyer selected Emu Bay as the port to service the Company’s inland holdings at Hampshire and Surrey Hills, located around inland. A year later, government surveyor John Helder Wedge recommended Emu Bay be reserved as an official township due to its strategic value for shipping. Still, the VDL Company was already occupying the area. At that time, the Emu Bay settlement consisted of a store, a small jetty, a sawpit, and a few huts. Hellyer also cut the Old Surrey Road through dense rainforest, establishing the first road on the North West Coast, starting from the South Burnie beach.

However, Burnie’s settlement wasn’t peaceful. Between 1828 and 1832, Tarenorerer, a Tommeginne woman who had escaped from sealers, became the leader of the Emu Bay people (Plairhekehillerplue). She led a resistance against settlers during the Black War, attacking VDL Company employees until she was eventually captured. Alexander Goldie, the first superintendent of the Company&#x27;s land assets around Emu Bay, led armed attacks against the Plairhekehillerplue clan. In 1828, Goldie and his men massacred several people inland from the settlement and in August 1829 they murdered a native woman at Emu Bay by shooting her and cutting her neck with an axe. Goldie then kidnapped the woman&#x27;s five-year-old daughter and another woman. After an investigation, Goldie resigned from his position.
Meanwhile, the VDL Company faced difficulties. By 1833, sheep farming at Surrey Hills had failed due to cold conditions, resulting in the near abandonment of the area.

Throughout the 1840s, the VDL Company began leasing bush blocks to tenant farmers, although Burnie’s growth remained slow. In 1843, the town was surveyed by Nathaniel Kentish and renamed after William Burnie, then serving as on of eighteen directors of the VDL Company.
By 1853, Burnie had a population of approximately 200, with basic services such as a doctor and clergyman located in Port Sorell, and a lawyer and banker in Launceston. Transport and communication systems were rudimentary at this time, with no metal roads or established wharves. Nevertheless, the first official birth registrations in Burnie began that year.

Burnie’s first school was opened in 1862 by Mrs. Mary Morris in West Burnie, followed by the construction of the first government school on a rocky hill off Wilmot Street. In 1875, the VDL Company established its headquarters in Oakleigh (now Oakleigh Park), which remained in Burnie until the early 1950s. Burnie became the base for developing the region’s road and rail infrastructure.

===Mineral boom and industrial development (1876–1939)===

In the late 1870s, modern communication systems arrived, with the telegraph and telephone reaching Burnie. A horse-drawn tramway on wooden rails was established to connect Burnie to Waratah. The VDL Company later upgraded this tramway to iron and steam, facilitating the transport of tin from the Mount Bischoff mine, which commenced Burnie’s role as the west coast’s export gateway for minerals. By the 1880s, Burnie&#x27;s fortunes had dramatically improved as west coast mineral deposits were discovered. The Emu Bay Railway Company extended the railway to Zeehan by 1900, propelling the town&#x27;s population to over 1,500.

During this time, Burnie’s business district rapidly grew, thanks to improved port facilities and the expansion of the town&#x27;s infrastructure. By 1900, T. Wiseman&#x27;s motor coach service was operating between Burnie and Stanley, reflecting Burnie&#x27;s growing importance as a regional transport hub.

A major turning point occurred in 1936 with the development of the pulp and paper mill in South Burnie. Constructed by Associated Pulp and Paper Mills (APPM), by 1939 the mill produced of fine paper annually, the first time in the world that paper was made entirely from eucalypt pulp. This industrial expansion caused a surge in employment and population growth, setting Burnie on the path to becoming an industrial powerhouse.

===Post-war boom and industrial expansion (1940–1980s)===
The post-war era saw Burnie become synonymous with industry.Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, APPM expanded its workforce to around 3,500 employees, while other secondary industries, including pigment producer Tioxide and North West Acid, were established.
This industrial boom led to Burnie’s official recognition as a city in 1988. At its peak in the mid 1980s, Burnie had a population exceeding 20,500, thriving as a bustling industrial centre.

However, the town&#x27;s success came with environmental consequences. During the 1970s, the production of titanium dioxide by Tioxide led to heavy pollution, turning the sea rust-red from effluent.
Burnie also developed a reputation as one of Tasmania’s most polluted towns, a situation highlighted by the Australian band Midnight Oil in their song “Burnie,” which criticised the town’s environmental issues.

===Challenges and reinvention (1980s–present)===

The rationalisation of Australian industry during the 1980s and 1990s dealt a severe blow to Burnie. APPM downgraded its operations and eventually closed the pulp mill in 2010, leading to significant job losses. Other closures followed, including the Caterpillar mining machinery factory, triggering a period of economic uncertainty for the town.

Despite these setbacks leading to unstable population and inconsistent investment, Burnie began to reinvent itself in the 1990s. The Lion cheese-making factory remained a major employer, and efforts were made to diversify the city’s economy.
By the 2000s, Burnie shifted toward tourism and the arts. It became known for its clean beaches, inclusion on the annual cruise ship itinerary, and its growing community of artists and makers. In 2016, Elphinstone Group, previously a designer and manufacturer for Caterpillar equipment in Australia, relaunched its original brand and developed the Haulmax 3900 series off-highway haul truck. The company continues to be a major local employer, with a workforce of 2,500 people. Today, Burnie positions itself as the gateway to Tasmania’s northwest, including the Tarkine forest, and as a hub for new industries and outdoor recreation.

==Demographics==
Burnie had a population of 19,918 according to the , making it one of the key urban centres in North West Tasmania. Historically, Burnie has experienced periods of rapid growth, particularly in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, followed by fluctuations in more recent decades, with some signs of stabilisation and recovery in the 21st century. While 2023 State Government growth estimates are positive, Burnie is yet to recover to population levels experienced in the mid 1980s. At the 2021 census, Burnie&#x27;s population is slightly older compared to national averages, with a significant portion (around 19%) aged 65 and over. This reflects a trend of ageing populations common in regional areas.

Economically, Burnie is a working-class hub with a median household income of $1,148 per week, lower than the national median of $1,746. The city&#x27;s unemployment rate was around 8.1%, higher than the national rate of 5.1%. These figures suggest some economic challenges in the area, although Burnie&#x27;s role as a regional port and industrial centre still gives it economic significance within Tasmania.

Burnie also has a notable Indigenous population, with around 8.5% of residents identifying as First Nations people or Torres Strait Islander, higher than the national figure of 3.2%. This reflects Tasmania&#x27;s broader demographics where Indigenous representation is above the national average.
The majority of residents (84.4%) were born in Australia, with smaller populations from England (2.4%), New Zealand (0.9%), India (0.8%), Nepal and the Philippines (0.4%), and mainland China (0.3%). English is the dominant language, spoken by 90.2% of residents at home, while 5.9% of households speak a non-English language.

In terms of religion, 53.4% of Burnie&#x27;s population reported no religious affiliation, while 38.8% identified with a Christian denomination, including 11.4% as Catholic and 11.2% as Anglican. Other religious groups include Hinduism (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%), Islam (0.6%), and Sikhism (0.2%).

==Climate==
Burnie has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), with mild, relatively dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Seasonal variation is low due to its seaside location along the Bass Strait. Average maxima vary from in February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July.
Mean average annual rainfall is moderate, spread between 158.0 precipitation days, and is concentrated in winter. 

The town is fairly cloudy, with 141.1 cloudy days and only 51.7 clear days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 14 July 1967 to on 31 January 2009. Sunshine data were sourced from Elliott, a rural locality west-northwest of Burnie.

==Governance==
There are nine councillors that govern the Burnie City Council, each serving four-year terms. Teeny Brumby was elected mayor of the City of Burnie in 2022. The council oversees Burnie&#x27;s infrastructure, community services, and local regulations. The council also plays a key role in fostering the arts and supporting projects like the Burnie Arts and Function Centre.

Burnie’s political landscape is shaped by a mix of conservative and independent influences, reflecting broader trends in Tasmania’s evolving political dynamics.
At the state level, Burnie falls within the Tasmanian House of Assembly’s electoral division of Braddon, a multi-member electorate that includes both Labor and Liberal members.

Nationally, Burnie is located in the federal electorate of Braddon, currently represented by Gavin Pearce of the Liberal Party of Australia. Braddon has traditionally been a marginal seat, with representation often alternating between the Labor and Liberal parties in federal elections.

In the Australian Senate, Tasmania is represented by six senators, including Jacquie Lambie, the leader and founder of the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN). Lambie, a well-known political figure, resides in Burnie, where she maintains significant support.

== Economy ==
Burnie&#x27;s economy has long been shaped by its key industries of heavy manufacturing, forestry, and farming, with the Port of Burnie playing a central role. 
Historically, the port became the main hub for exporting minerals from Tasmania&#x27;s west coast after the Emu Bay Railway opened in 1897, cementing Burnie’s status as an industrial centre. The railway and the port served as the backbone of Burnie&#x27;s early industry, driving the city’s growth and development.

Over time, the agriculture industry, once prominent in the region, shifted focus following the handover of the Surrey Hills and Hampshire Hills lots.
This transition marked the rise of the forestry sector, which began to dominate Burnie’s economy in the 20th century. Forestry played a pivotal role in the city’s development, particularly with the establishment of the Associated Pulp and Paper Mill (APPM) in 1938.
The founding of the pulp and paper mill marked a significant industrial milestone for Burnie, positioning it as a key player in Australia’s paper production. The city also became a centre for woodchip exports, with the construction of the woodchip terminal further bolstering its role in the forestry supply chain.

However, the decline of the paper industry signaled a major economic shift for Burnie. The closure of the APPM in 2010, after a failed attempt to secure a buyer, marked the end of an era for one of the city&#x27;s most iconic industries.
Despite the mill’s closure, forestry remains an important part of Burnie&#x27;s economy, with woodchip exports continuing through the Burnie Chip Export Terminal, colloquially known as the &quot;Pyramids of Burnie&quot;. While heavy manufacturing and forestry continue to be significant, Burnie has sought to diversify its economy in recent years, exploring opportunities in renewable energy, tourism, and education.

===Emerging industry===
====Marinus Link====
The Marinus Link project is expected to further boost Burnie&#x27;s economy. This $3.5b (2021) project will connect Heybridge to Waratah Bay, Victoria via of high voltage direct current submarine power cable, supplying renewable energy to the Australian mainland.
Supporting infrastructure, including the North West Transmission Developments, will reinforce Burnie’s position as a renewable energy hub. The project is expected to generate 1,400 local jobs and contribute $3b in direct economic investment while supplying enough electricity to power 1.5 million homes and significantly reducing carbon emissions. Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed by 2030.

====E-fuels facility====
Burnie was chosen as the site for Australia’s first commercial-scale e-fuels facility due to Tasmania&#x27;s 100% renewables grid, its deep water port facilities and its proximity to Forico’s Surrey Hills plantation.
This nationally significant, $1b facility will produce up to of carbon-neutral e-fuels annually, helping to decarbonise industries that still rely on liquid fuels, such as aviation, shipping, and heavy transport. By using renewable energy to power its processes, the plant aims to reduce global carbon emissions by approximately per year, equivalent to decarbonising 52,000 cars.
Designed by France’s Technip Energies NV, the facility is set to be active by 2028 and create 200 permanent jobs.

====Wind farms====
Several wind farm projects proposed in the surrounding region, notably the Guildford and Hellyer Wind Farms, located south of Burnie, are part of Tasmania&#x27;s broader push to increase its renewable energy capacity. These wind farms are expected to generate significant power, contributing to the state&#x27;s goal of 200% renewable energy by 2040.

== Cultural and educational institutions ==

Burnie has long been a hub for cultural, educational, and health services in the northwest region of Tasmania. At the heart of its cultural precinct is the Burnie Arts &amp; Function Centre, which replaced the old Burnie Theatre in 1965. Originally known as the Civic Centre, this multi-functional venue is an important space for the community, hosting performances, events, and exhibitions that attract visitors from across the region. The centre is also home to one of Australia&#x27;s largest regional art galleries, which opened in 1978, and the Burnie Regional Museum, designed by architects Leith and Bartlett, which houses the historic Federation Street—the first indoor streetscape of its kind in the country.

In 2021, plans for a new $18m North West Museum and Art Gallery, designed by Terrior Architects,
were abandoned. Instead, the focus shifted toward enhancing and consolidating the region’s existing cultural facilities.
The Burnie Library (formerly known as the Hellyer Regional Library) is part of the Libraries Tasmania network, serving as a major community resource, offering public access to books, digital resources, and research materials. The library also plays an important role in Burnie’s educational and cultural landscape, providing services for children, secondary education, technical college and other tertiary students. In late 2024, during the temporary closure of the Burnie Library, a pop-up library was operated within the Burnie Regional Museum to continue providing services to the community. This temporary arrangement highlighted the collaborative efforts between cultural institutions in Burnie.

In addition to these cultural landmarks, Burnie provides essential health services through the North West Regional Hospital, located on Brickport Road. As the third-largest hospital in Tasmania, it offers a range of in-patient and out-patient services, including general medicine, surgery, orthopaedics, psychiatry, and paediatrics, playing a vital role in the well-being of the wider community.

Burnie is also home to key educational institutions, including the Cradle Coast campus of the University of Tasmania (UTAS), where the Cuthbertson Research Laboratories are part of the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research. The town also hosts campuses for the Tasmanian Polytechnic and Tasmanian Academy, ensuring a range of learning opportunities for students in the region. Alongside these, Burnie boasts numerous sporting and social organisations that contribute to the vibrant community life.

<text>Julius Houseman (December 8, 1832 – February 8, 1891) was an American businessman and politician who served as mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan, as representative in the Michigan House of Representatives and as Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Early life==
He was born in Zeckendorf (near Bamberg), in the Kingdom of Bavaria in the German Confederation. His father, Solomon Houseman, was a merchant and manufacturer of silk and cotton goods in Zeckendorf. Houseman was educated in the national schools of Zeckendorf and Bamberg and finished with a two-year course of study at a commercial school at Munich. He then worked as dry goods clerk in a store in Bavaria, where he remained for three years.

==Career==
He immigrated to the United States in 1851, at the age of nineteen, stopping first in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he was clerk in a clothing house for a few months. He then moved to New Vienna, Ohio, where he remained as clerk in a general store until March 1852. He then moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, and engaged in the merchant tailoring and clothing business with Mr. I. Amberg, the firm name being &quot;Amberg &amp; Houseman&quot;. He moved to Grand Rapids in August 1852, before he was twenty years old, and established a branch of the Battle Creek firm. He is recognized as the first permanent Jewish settler of Grand Rapids.

The business prospered, and in 1854, he became sole proprietor, which he continued for nine years. In 1864 the firm of &quot;Houseman, Alsberg &amp; Co.&quot; was organized, with branch houses in New York, Baltimore and Savannah. The firm continued until 1870, when it was dissolved, with Mr. Houseman retaining possession of the Grand Rapids establishment. In 1876 he disposed of his business to his cousin, Joseph Houseman, who had been a partner for several years, and Moses May, who continued it for a number of years under the firm name of &quot;Houseman &amp; May&quot;, which was later succeeded by &quot;Houseman, Donally &amp; Jones&quot;.

Houseman had developed an active interest in other lines of business and investments, notably in timber lands and the manufacture of pine lumber in Michigan, and after 1876 devoted himself largely to those interests. He was one of the largest holders of real estate in the Grand Rapids area and also held large tracts in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and in other states.

He also became involved with other business interests in Grand Rapids. In 1870 he became a stockholder in the City National bank, the predecessor of the National City bank. In August 1874, he was chosen a director to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the late Ransom E. Wood, who was going to Europe with his family.

In 1882, at the annual meeting in January he was chosen vice president of the bank when the late William B. Ledyard declined a re-election because of infirm health. Houseman was one of the organizers of the Grand Rapids chair company, serving as a director and vice president. He was also a director of the Grand Rapids Brush company and a leading stockholder, director and president of the Grand Rapids Fire Insurance company. He was one of the founders and directors of the Michigan Trust company and was also identified with many other enterprises.

==Political career==
Houseman was also active in the political arena. He was member of the board of aldermen of Grand Rapids for eight years, from 1863 to 1870. He represented the first district of Kent County in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1871 to 1872, He served two terms as mayor of Grand Rapids in 1872-1873 and 1874–1875 and was an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor in 1876. He was elected as a Fusion candidate and seated with the Democrats in the United States House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district, serving from 1883 to 1885, the first Jewish representative from Michigan. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1884 and resumed his former business pursuits.

He became a member of the Freemasons in 1854 and was a member of the Odd Fellows and of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. He was a charter member of the local Peninsular Club and was a member of the local Owashtanong club. He was influential in forming the Temple Emanuel in 1857, the fifth oldest reform congregation in the United States, and in founding the first Jewish organization in Grand Rapids, the Jewish Benevolent and Burial Society.

==Death and legacy==
He died in Grand Rapids and is interred in Oak Hill Cemetery there. He left a large property, estimated to be worth approximately a million dollars. He was survived by his daughter, an only child, Mrs. David M. Amberg and family of Grand Rapids; his sister, Mrs. M. Alsberg of New York city; William Houseman, a half brother; Mrs. Simon Mainzer, a half sister, and his cousin, Mr. Joseph Houseman and family. There were also several half-brothers and half-sisters in Germany.

In 1907, his daughter, Hattie Houseman Amberg, donated six acres (24,000 m2) of land to the Grand Rapids Board of Education for use as an athletic field in memory of her father. In 1924, she gave an additional adjoining tract of land. The Houseman Field continues be shared by several Grand Rapids area high schools.

<doc id="436111" wikidata="Q1383594" url="?curid=436111" title="Executive officer">
<text>An executive officer is a person who is principally responsible for leading all or part of an organization, although the exact nature of the role varies depending on the organization.

In many militaries and police forces, an executive officer (XO) is the second-in-command, reporting to the commanding officer (CO). The XO is typically responsible for the management of day-to-day activities, freeing the commander to concentrate on strategy and planning the unit&#x27;s next move.

==Administrative law==
While there is no clear line between principal executive officers and inferior executive officers, principal officers are high-level officials in the executive branch of U.S. government such as department heads of independent agencies. In &quot;Humphrey&#x27;s Executor v. United States&quot;, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers by stating that the former serve at the pleasure of the president and may be removed at their discretion. The latter are removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress. The decision by the Court was that the Federal Trade Commission was a quasi-legislative body because of other powers it had, and therefore, the president could not fire an FTC member for political reasons. Congress can&#x27;t retain removal power over officials with executive function (&quot;Bowsher v. Synar&quot;). However, statutes can restrict removal if not purely executive (&quot;Humphrey&quot;″s executor), but can&#x27;t restrict removal of purely executive officer (&quot;Myers v. United States,&quot; 272 U.S. 52 (1926)). The standard is whether restriction &quot;impedes the president&#x27;s ability to perform his constitutional duty&quot; (&quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot;, 487 U.S. 654 (1988)).

==Corporate law and other legal associations==
In business, executive officers are usually the top staff members of a corporation, the chief executive officer (CEO) being the best-known type. The definition varies; for instance, the California Corporate Disclosure Act defines &quot;executive officers&quot; as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the board of directors. In many insurance policies, executive officer means, in the case of a corporation, any chairman, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, president, or general counsel. In the case of a sole proprietorship, an executive officer is the sole proprietor. In the case of a partnership, an executive officer is a managing partner, senior partner, or administrative partner. In the case of a limited liability company, an executive officer is any member, manager, or officer.

In charities, voluntary sectors and Nonprofit organizations, the executive officers are those appointed to drive the day-to-day decisions of the organization. This is normally a formal appointment made by the executive board of trustees. Specific responsibilities and scope vary and are usually called out in a governance document.

== Military ==

In the units of some military forces, the executive officer is the second-in-command, reporting to the commanding officer (CO).

In most non-naval military services that are land-based (except the U.S. Army, where an executive officer is the second-in-command of certain units) or in joint military organizations, the executive officer is an administrative staff position versus a command position. XOs in these positions typically assist a commander or deputy commander (or in the case of joint staffs or joint commands, a director) by managing day-to-day activities such as management of the senior officer&#x27;s schedule, screening of documents or other products, and oversight of the senior officer&#x27;s administrative support staff.

Management of individual assets in the airline industry is derived from the military terminology, where an executive officer or first officer, is the second in command of the aircraft. In a fixed wing aircraft, the first officer sits in the right-hand seat, but on a rotary wing aircraft, they sit on the left. Management of the airline as a whole is more in-line with the corporate example above.

=== India ===
The term &#x27;Executive officer&#x27; is used in the Indian Navy. Abbreviated as EXO, the officer is the second-in-command of a ship or shore establishment. In the Indian Army, second-in-command (2IC) is the designation used.

=== United Kingdom ===

The term XO is not used in most British Army or Royal Marines units, where the designation second-in-command (2i/c) is used as a formal appointment. However, the position does exist in some specialist regiments within the Royal Artillery where the exact duties vary. In the Royal Air Force, the term XO is informally used between officers and airmen, referring to the officer who is second-in-command. It is, however, formally used in the Royal Navy. In smaller vessels, such as submarines and frigates, the executive officer also holds the position of first lieutenant. Originally, the second-in-command was usually referred to as the first lieutenant (or as &quot;number one&quot;), although it is becoming more common to hear the term XO. On larger ships of the Royal Navy, in which the XO holds the rank of commander, the XO is usually referred to simply as &quot;the commander&quot;. The XO also heads the executive department.

=== United States ===
==== United States Army ====
There are executive officer slots in each company, battalion, regiment, and brigade, though generally not at higher levels of command until the army level. The XO is typically the second-in-command, and serves as the day-to-day manager of the command staff. The XO is typically responsible for the management of day-to-day activities, such as administration, maintenance, and logistics, freeing a commander to concentrate on tactical/operational planning and execution and a general officer commander to concentrate on similar planning and execution at the operational-strategic level. The XO may take charge in the absence of the commander, the exception being commands with a deputy commander, although recent army command reductions have either merged the two, or eliminated the deputy.

A few organizations within the army maintain authorizations for a chief warrant officer to serve as an XO/2IC. One example of this is the Modular Ammunition Platoon, where the ammunition technician acts as the second-in-command during the absence of the platoon leader. While the experience gained as an XO is highly beneficial for an army officer&#x27;s professional development, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for a command position. At the army level of command, a commanding general will have a deputy commanding general as second in command and an &quot;executive officer&quot; on their personal staff who works as their liaison to the general staff and an aide-de-camp who takes care of their calendar and personal needs.

==== United States Marine Corps ====
The executive officer is the billet of the officer who is second-in-command at the company/battery, battalion/squadron, and Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU)/regiment/aviation group (i.e., Marine Aircraft Group, Marine Air Control Group, and Marine Wing Support Group) level. Per the &quot;Marine Corps Manual&quot;, paragraph 1007.5: &quot;The executive officer shall be an officer of the organization who is eligible to succeed to command, and normally will be the officer next in rank to the commander. As the direct representative of the commander, all orders issued by the executive officer shall have the same force and effect as though issued by the commander. The executive officer shall conform to and effectuate the policies and orders of the commander and shall be prepared to assume command at any time the need should arise.&quot; At higher levels of command, the second-in-command is the assistant division/wing commander or, in the case of a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), deputy commander. For those commands having a general officer (usually a brigadier general) in command without a designated assistant commander or deputy commander, such as a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) or Marine Logistics Group (MLG), the chief of staff (a colonel) is the second-in-command. Unlike their U.S. Navy counterparts, XOs of U.S. Marine Corps squadrons in U.S. Naval Aviation do not &quot;fleet up&quot; to become CO.

==== United States Navy and United States Coast Guard ====
The executive officer is the billet of the officer who is second-in-command. An XO is assigned to all ships, aviation squadrons, and shore units and installations, and is responsible to the captain for all ship&#x27;s work, drills, exercises, personnel organization, and the policing and inspection of the ship. When the ship goes to action stations, the XO confirms that the ship actually is ready for combat and reports this to the captain. The XO&#x27;s own action station is in a separate part of the ship from that of the captain, so that a single hit will not likely incapacitate both officers. On small ships with no first lieutenant, gunnery officer, or navigator, the executive officer may also be responsible for the duties of those officers. Carrier air wings in the U.S. Navy do not have an XO, but have a deputy commander (DCAG) instead; for shore-based or functional naval air wings headed by a commodore, the equivalent position is the deputy commodore.

In the U.S. Coast Guard, on board small cutters and patrol boats that are commanded by either a junior officer or a senior enlisted member, executive chief petty officers or executive petty officers are usually assigned to serve as second-in-command.

On U.S. aircraft carriers, per Title 10 United States Code, both the captain (i.e., the commanding officer or CO) and the XO assigned to the ship are naval aviators or naval flight officers. Although not specified by 10 U.S.C., large, air-capable amphibious assault ships will have one of the two senior positions (CO or XO) occupied by a surface warfare officer and the other by a naval aviator or naval flight officer, alternating at each change of command. In naval aviation, in U.S. Navy squadrons (other than the Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS) and the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron {viz., Blue Angels}), the XO will eventually &quot;fleet up&quot; to become the CO of that squadron after twelve to fifteen months as XO. This fleet up model was also adopted in the late 2000s for XO and CO positions of both large amphibious assault ships (but not aircraft carriers) and &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class guided missile destroyers. In addition to operational and tactical responsibilities, XOs also shoulder most of the CO&#x27;s administrative burden, to include oversight of the command&#x27;s administrative officer (if assigned) and administrative department.

The term of XO in the Navy and Coast Guard should not be confused with the term &quot;executive assistant&quot; (&quot;EA&quot;) in those services, the latter being an officer in the rank of captain (O-6) who serves either dual-hatted as, or in addition to, the chief of staff to a flag officer.

==== United States Air Force ====
In the U.S. Air Force, XO is not a command or second-in-command position. Instead, it is used to designate a company grade officer or junior field grade officer who serves as a staff administrative assistant to a senior officer, starting with a commander at the squadron level or above (e.g., squadron, group, wing, numbered air force, major command). In the other uniformed services, this position may be called an aide, an &quot;executive assistant&quot; or an adjutant.

Like the Army, while experience gained as an XO is highly beneficial for an Air Force officer&#x27;s professional development, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for a command position. However, it is often the norm that nearly all Air Force commanders will have been an XO at some point earlier in their careers. For officers holding second-in-command positions, the U.S. Air Force uses the titles of &quot;vice commander&quot; (CV), or &quot;deputy commander&quot; (CD) for an officer who serves as the second-in-command for an organization above squadron level. For a squadron level organization, the second-in-command is typically termed the &quot;director of operations&quot; or &quot;operations officer&quot; (DO). These latter terms were previously used for similar positions at the group and wing level until renamed as the &quot;operations group commander (OG/CC). The rank of an executive officer in the U.S. Air Force can vary from a junior officer supporting a mid level commander up to a senior field grade (FGO) supporting a general officer.

====Personal staff officers==== 
The U.S. Air Force uses the term &quot;executive officer&quot; for officers assigned as personal staff officers to general officers. Their role is similar to aides-de-camp in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, and flag aides and flag lieutenants in the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard.

==== Executive officer, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ====
A unique application of the term is executive officer to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), and commander, United States European Command. This position is typically held by a brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half) and is drawn from all of the armed services. The duties involve serving as both an &quot;executive assistant&quot; to the SACEUR and also includes command responsibilities for the U.S. military community at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Belgium.

<text>RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; was a British ocean liner launched by the Cunard Line in 1906. She was the world&#x27;s largest passenger ship until the completion of her sister three months later and was awarded the Blue Riband appellation for the fastest Atlantic crossing in 1908. RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sunk on her 202nd trans-Atlantic crossing, on 7 May 1915 by the German submarine &quot;U-20&quot;, off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, killing 1,197 passengers, crew and stowaways. The sinking occurred about two years before the United States declaration of war on Germany, but significantly increased American domestic public support for entering the war.

== Overview ==
German shipping lines were Cunard&#x27;s main competitors for the custom of transatlantic passengers in the early 20th century, and Cunard responded by building two new &#x27;ocean greyhounds&#x27;: &quot;Lusitania&quot; and . Cunard used assistance from the British Admiralty to build both new ships, on the understanding that the ship would be available for military duty in time of war. During construction gun mounts for deck cannons were installed but no guns were ever fitted. Both &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; were fitted with turbine engines that enabled them to maintain a service speed of . They were equipped with lifts, wireless telegraph, and electric light, and provided 50 percent more passenger space than any other ship; the first-class decks were known for their sumptuous furnishings.

A series of tit-for-tat moves intensified the naval portion of World War I. The Royal Navy had blockaded Germany at the start of the war; as a reprisal to German naval mining efforts, the UK then declared the North Sea a military area in the autumn of 1914 and mined the approaches. As their own reprisal, Germany had declared the seas around the United Kingdom a war zone, wherein all allied ships would be liable to be sunk without warning. Britain then declared all food imports for Germany were contraband. When submarines failed to sink many ships, the German authorities loosened U-boat rules of engagement. The German embassy in the United States also placed fifty newspaper advertisements warning people of the dangers of sailing on a British ship in the area, which happened to appear just as RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; left New York for Britain on 1 May 1915. Objections were made by the British and Americans that threatening to torpedo all ships indiscriminately was wrong, whether it was announced in advance or not.

On the afternoon of 7 May, a German U-boat torpedoed &quot;Lusitania&quot; off the southern coast of Ireland inside the declared war zone. A second internal explosion occurred. The damage caused her to sink in 18 minutes, killing 1,197 passengers and crew. Hundreds of bodies washed ashore, but most were never found.

The German government attempted to find justifications for sinking &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Special justifications focused on the small declared cargo of 173 tons of war materials on board the 44,000 ton displacement ship, and false claims that she was an armed warship and carried Canadian troops. In defence of indiscriminately sinking ships without warning, they asserted that cruiser rules were obsolete, as British merchant ships could be armed and had been instructed to evade or ram U-boats if the opportunity arose, and that the general warning given to all ships in the war zone was sufficient.

After the First World War, successive British governments maintained that there were no &quot;munitions&quot; (apart from small arms ammunition) on board &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and the Germans were not justified in treating the ship as a naval vessel. But the most important protests at the time came from the US. Under neutrality inspections, the US was aware the ship was not armed, was acting in accordance with American law, and was chiefly a passenger vessel carrying almost two thousand civilian passengers and crew, including over a hundred American citizens (including many celebrities) among the dead. The US government argued that whatever the circumstances, nothing could justify the killing of large numbers of un-resisting civilians, and that America had a responsibility to protect the lives of law-abiding Americans. The Americans had already warned the Germans repeatedly about their actions, and the Germans had also demonstrated that submarines were able to sink merchant ships under cruiser rules.

The sinking shifted public and leadership opinion in the United States against Germany. US and internal German pressure led to a suspension of German Admiralty policy of deliberately targeting passenger ships, as well as later stronger restrictions. War was eventually declared in 1917 after the German Government chose to violate these restrictions, deliberately attacking American shipping and preparing the way for conflict with the Zimmermann Telegram.

==Development and construction==

&quot;Lusitania&quot; and were commissioned by Cunard, responding to increasing competition from rival transatlantic passenger companies, particularly the German Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) and Hamburg America Line (HAPAG). They had larger, faster, more modern and more luxurious ships than Cunard, and were better placed, starting from German ports, to capture the lucrative trade in emigrants leaving Europe for North America. The NDL liner captured the Blue Riband from Cunard&#x27;s in 1897, before the prize was taken in 1900 by the HAPAG ship . NDL soon wrested the prize back in 1903 with the new and . Cunard saw its passenger numbers affected as a result of the so-called &quot;s&quot;.
American millionaire businessman J. P. Morgan had decided to invest in transatlantic shipping by creating a new company, International Mercantile Marine (IMM), and, in 1901, purchased the British freight shipper Frederick Leyland &amp; Co. and a controlling interest in the British passenger White Star Line and folded them into IMM. In 1902, IMM, NDL and HAPAG entered into a &quot;Community of Interest&quot; to fix prices and divide among them the transatlantic trade. The partners also acquired a 51% stake in the Dutch Holland America Line. IMM made offers to purchase Cunard which, along with the French Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (CGT), was now its principal rival.

Cunard chairman Lord Inverclyde thus approached the British government for assistance. Faced with the impending collapse of the British liner fleet and the consequent loss of national prestige, as well as the reserve of shipping for war purposes which it represented, they agreed to help. Under the terms of an agreement signed in June 1903, Cunard was given a loan of £2.6 million to finance two ships, repayable over 20 years at a favourable interest rate of 2.75%. The ships would receive an annual operating subsidy of £75,000 each plus a mail contract worth £68,000. In return, the ships would be built to Admiralty specifications so that they could be used as auxiliary cruisers in wartime. Due to receiving this subsidy, &quot;Lusitania&quot; and her sister ship received special permission to fly the Blue Ensign, as a Royal Naval Reserve Merchant Vessel.

===Design===

Cunard established a committee to decide upon the design for the new ships, of which James Bain, Cunard&#x27;s Marine Superintendent was the chairman. Other members included Rear Admiral H. J. Oram, who had been involved in designs for steam turbine-powered ships for the Royal Navy, and Charles Parsons, whose company Parsons Marine was now producing turbine engines.

Parsons maintained that he could design engines capable of maintaining a speed of , which would require . The largest turbine sets built so far had been of for the battleship, and for -class battlecruisers, which meant the engines would be of a new, untested design. Turbines offered the advantages of generating less vibration than the reciprocating engines and greater reliability in operation at high speeds, combined with lower fuel consumption. Having initially turned down the use of this relatively untried type of engine, Cunard was persuaded by the Admiralty to set up a committee of marine professionals to look at its possible use on the new liners. The relative merits of turbines and reciprocating engines were investigated in a series of trials between Newhaven and Dieppe using the turbine-driven cross-Channel ferry Brighton and the similarity-designed Arundel, which had reciprocating engines. The Turbine Committee was convinced by these and other tests that turbines were the way forward and recommended on 24 March 1904 that they should be used on the new express liners. In order to gain some experience of these new engines, Cunard asked John Brown to fit turbines on , the second of a pair of 19,500g-intermediate liners under construction at the yard. &quot;Carmania&quot; was completed in 1905 and this gave Cunard almost two years of experience before the introduction of their new super liners in 1907.

The ship was designed by Leonard Peskett and built by John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland. The ship&#x27;s name was taken from Lusitania, an ancient Roman province on the west of the Iberian Peninsula—the region that is now southern Portugal and Extremadura (Spain). The name had also been used by a previous ship built in 1871 and wrecked in 1901, making the name available from Lloyd&#x27;s for Cunard&#x27;s giant.
Peskett had built a large model of the proposed ship in 1902 showing a three-funnel design. A fourth funnel was implemented into the design in 1904 as it was necessary to vent the exhaust from additional boilers fitted after steam turbines had been settled on as the power plant. The original plan called for three propellers, but this was altered to four because it was felt the necessary power could not be transmitted through just three. Four turbines would drive four separate propellers, with additional reversing turbines to drive the two inboard shafts only. To improve efficiency, the two inboard propellers rotated inward, while those outboard rotated outward. The outboard turbines operated at high pressure; the exhaust steam then passing to those inboard at relatively low pressure.

The propellers were driven directly by the turbines, for sufficiently robust gearboxes had not yet been developed, and became available in only 1916. Instead, the turbines had to be designed to run at a much lower speed than those normally accepted as being optimum. Thus, the efficiency of the turbines installed was less at low speeds than a conventional reciprocating steam engine, but considerably superior when the engines were run at high speed, as was usually the case for an express liner. The ship was fitted with 23 double-ended and two single-ended boilers (which fitted the forward space where the ship narrowed), operating at a maximum and containing 192 individual furnaces.
Work to refine the hull shape was conducted in the Admiralty experimental tank at Haslar, Gosport. As a result of experiments, the beam of the ship was increased by over that initially intended to improve stability. The hull immediately in front of the rudder and the balanced rudder itself followed naval design practice to improve the vessel&#x27;s turning response. The Admiralty contract required that all machinery be below the waterline, where it was considered to be better protected from gunfire, and the aft third of the ship below water was used to house the turbines, the steering motors and four steam-driven turbo-generators. The central half contained four boiler rooms, with the remaining space at the forward end of the ship being reserved for cargo and other storage.

Coal bunkers were placed along the length of the ship outboard of the boiler rooms, with a large transverse bunker immediately in front of that most forward (number 1) boiler room. Apart from convenience ready for use, the coal was considered to provide added protection for the central spaces against attack. At the very front were the chain lockers for the huge anchor chains and ballast tanks to adjust the ship&#x27;s trim.

The hull space was divided into 13 watertight compartments, any two of which could be flooded without risk of the ship sinking, connected by 35 hydraulically operated watertight doors. A critical flaw in the arrangement of the watertight compartments was that sliding doors to the coal bunkers needed to be open to provide a constant feed of coal whilst the ship was operating, and closing these in emergency conditions could be problematic. The ship had a double bottom with the space between divided into separate watertight cells. The ship&#x27;s exceptional height was due to the six decks of passenger accommodation above the waterline, compared to the customary four decks in existing liners.

High-tensile steel was used for the ship&#x27;s plating, as opposed to the more conventional mild steel. This allowed a reduction in plate thickness, reducing weight but still providing 26 per cent greater strength than otherwise. Plates were held together by triple rows of rivets. The ship was heated and cooled throughout by a thermo-tank ventilation system, which used steam-driven heat exchangers to warm air to a constant , while steam was injected into the airflow to maintain steady humidity.

Forty-nine separate units driven by electric fans provided seven complete changes of air per hour throughout the ship, through an interconnected system, so that individual units could be switched off for maintenance. A separate system of exhaust fans removed air from galleys and bathrooms. As built, the ship conformed fully with Board of Trade safety regulations which required sixteen lifeboats with a capacity of about 1,000 people.

At the time of her completion, &quot;Lusitania&quot; was briefly the largest ship ever built, but was soon eclipsed by the slightly larger &quot;Mauretania&quot; which entered service shortly afterwards. She was longer, a full faster, and had a capacity of 10,000 gross register tons over and above that of the most modern German liner, . Passenger accommodation was 50% larger than any of her competitors, providing for 552 saloon class, 460 cabin class and 1,186 in third class. Her crew comprised 69 on deck, 369 operating engines and boilers and 389 to attend to passengers. Both she and &quot;Mauretania&quot; had a wireless telegraph, electric lighting, electric lifts, sumptuous interiors and an early form of air-conditioning.

===Interiors===

At the time of their introduction onto the North Atlantic, both &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; possessed among the most luxurious, spacious and comfortable interiors afloat. The Scottish architect James Miller was chosen to design &quot;Lusitania&quot;″s interiors, while Harold Peto was chosen to design &quot;Mauretania&quot;. Miller chose to use plasterwork to create interiors whereas Peto made extensive use of wooden panelling, with the result that the overall impression given by &quot;Lusitania&quot; was brighter than &quot;Mauretania&quot;.

The ship&#x27;s passenger accommodation was spread across six decks; from the top deck down to the waterline they were Boat Deck (A Deck), the Promenade Deck (B Deck), the Shelter Deck (C Deck), the Upper Deck (D Deck), the Main Deck (E Deck) and the Lower Deck (F Deck), with each of the three passenger classes being allotted their own space on the ship. As seen aboard all passenger liners of the era, first-, second- and third-class passengers were strictly segregated from one another. According to her original configuration in 1907, she was designed to carry 2,198 passengers and 827 crew members. The Cunard Line prided itself with a record for passenger satisfaction.
&quot;Lusitania&quot;″s first-class accommodation was in the centre section of the ship on the five uppermost decks, mostly concentrated between the first and fourth funnels. When fully booked, &quot;Lusitania&quot; could cater to 552 first-class passengers. In common with all major liners of the period, &quot;Lusitania&quot;″s first-class interiors were decorated with a mélange of historical styles. The first-class dining saloon was the grandest of the ship&#x27;s public rooms; arranged over two decks with an open circular well at its centre and crowned by an elaborate dome measuring , decorated with frescos in the style of François Boucher, it was elegantly realised throughout in the neoclassical Louis XVI style. The lower floor measuring could seat 323, with a further 147 on the upper floor. The walls were finished with white and gilt carved mahogany panels, with Corinthian decorated columns which were required to support the floor above. The one concession to seaborne life was that furniture was bolted to the floor, meaning passengers could not rearrange their seating for their personal convenience.
All other first-class public rooms were situated on the boat deck and comprised a lounge, reading and writing room, smoking room and veranda café. The last was an innovation on a Cunard liner and, in warm weather, one side of the café could be opened up to give the impression of sitting outdoors. This would have been a rarely used feature given the often inclement weather of the North Atlantic.

The first-class lounge was decorated in Georgian style with inlaid mahogany panels surrounding a jade green carpet with a yellow floral pattern, measuring overall . It had a barrel vaulted skylight rising to with stained glass windows each representing one month of the year.

Each end of the lounge had a high green marble fireplace incorporating enamelled panels by Alexander Fisher. The design was linked overall with decorative plasterwork. The library walls were decorated with carved pilasters and mouldings marking out panels of grey and cream silk brocade. The carpet was rose, with Rose du Barry silk curtains and upholstery. The chairs and writing desks were mahogany, and the windows featured etched glass. The smoking room was Queen Anne style, with Italian walnut panelling and Italian red furnishings. The grand stairway linked all six decks of the passenger accommodation with wide hallways on each level and two lifts. First-class cabins ranged from one shared room through various ensuite arrangements in a choice of decorative styles culminating in the two regal suites which each had two bedrooms, dining room, parlour and bathroom. The port suite decoration was modelled on the Petit Trianon.

&quot;Lusitania&quot;″s second-class accommodation was confined to the stern, behind the aft mast, where quarters for 460 second-class passengers were located. The second-class public rooms were situated on partitioned sections of boat and promenade decks housed in a separate section of the superstructure aft of the first-class passenger quarters. Design work was deputised to Robert Whyte, who was the architect employed by John Brown. Although smaller and plainer, the design of the dining room reflected that of first class, with just one floor of diners under a ceiling with a smaller dome and balcony. Walls were panelled and carved with decorated pillars, all in white. As seen in first class, the dining room was situated lower down in the ship on the saloon deck. The smoking and ladies&#x27; rooms occupied the accommodation space of the second-class promenade deck, with the lounge on the boat deck.

Cunard had not previously provided a separate lounge for second class; the room had mahogany tables, chairs and settees set on a rose carpet. The smoking room was with mahogany panelling, white plaster work ceiling and dome. One wall had a mosaic of a river scene in Brittany, while the sliding windows were blue-tinted. Second-class passengers were allotted shared, yet comfortable two- and four-berth cabins arranged on the shelter, upper and main decks.

Noted as being the prime breadwinner for trans-Atlantic shipping lines, third class aboard &quot;Lusitania&quot; was praised for the improvement in travel conditions it provided to emigrant passengers; &quot;Lusitania&quot; proved to be a quite popular ship for immigrants. In the days before &quot;Lusitania&quot; and even still during the years in which &quot;Lusitania&quot; was in service, third-class accommodation consisted of large open spaces where hundreds of people would share open berths and hastily constructed public spaces, often consisting of no more than a small portion of open deck space and a few tables constructed within their sleeping quarters. In an attempt to break that mould, the Cunard Line began designing ships such as &quot;Lusitania&quot; with more comfortable third-class accommodation.

As on all Cunard passenger liners, third-class accommodation aboard &quot;Lusitania&quot; was located at the forward end of the ship on the shelter, upper, main and lower decks, and in comparison to other ships of the period, it was comfortable and spacious. The dining room was at the bow of the ship on the saloon deck, finished in polished pine as were the other two third-class public rooms, being the smoke room and ladies room on the shelter deck.

When &quot;Lusitania&quot; was fully booked in third class, the smoking and ladies room could easily be converted into overflow dining rooms for added convenience. Meals were eaten at long tables with swivel chairs and there were two sittings for meals. A piano was provided for passenger use. What greatly appealed to immigrants and lower class travellers was that instead of being confined to open berth dormitories, aboard &quot;Lusitania&quot; was a honeycomb of two, four, six and eight berth cabins allotted to third-class passengers on the main and lower decks.

The Bromsgrove Guild had designed and constructed most of the trim on &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Waring and Gillow tendered for the contract to furnish the whole ship, but failing to obtain this still supplied a number of the furnishings.

===Construction and trials===

&quot;Lusitania&quot;″s keel was laid at John Brown on Clydebank as yard no. 367 on 17 August 1904, Lord Inverclyde hammering home the first rivet. Cunard nicknamed her &#x27;the Scottish ship&#x27; in contrast to &quot;Mauretania&quot; whose contract went to Swan Hunter in England and who started building three months later. Final details of the two ships were left to designers at the two yards so that the ships differed in details of hull design and finished structure. The ships may most readily be distinguished in photographs through the flat-topped ventilators used on &quot;Lusitania&quot;, whereas those on &quot;Mauretania&quot; used a more conventional rounded top. 

The shipyard at John Brown had to be reorganised because of her size so that she could be launched diagonally across the widest available part of the river Clyde where it met a tributary (the River Cart), the ordinary width of the river being only compared to the long ship. The new slipway took up the space of two existing ones and was built on reinforcing piles driven deeply into the ground to ensure it could take the temporary concentrated weight of the whole ship as it slid into the water. In addition, the company spent £8,000 to dredge the Clyde, £6,500 on new gas plant, £6,500 on a new electrical plant, £18,000 to extend the dock and £19,000 for a new crane capable of lifting 150 tons as well as £20,000 on additional machinery and equipment.
Construction commenced at the bow working backwards, rather than the traditional approach of building both ends towards the middle. This was because designs for the stern and engine layout were not finalised when construction commenced. Railway tracks were laid alongside the ship and across deck plating to bring materials as required. The hull, completed to the level of the main deck but not fitted with equipment weighed about 16,000 tons.

The ship&#x27;s stockless bower anchors weighed 10 tons, attached to 125 ton, 330 fathom chains all manufactured by N. Hingley &amp; Sons Ltd. The steam capstans to raise them were constructed by Napier Brothers Ltd, of Glasgow. The turbines were long with diameter rotors, the large diameter necessary because of the relatively low speeds at which they operated. The rotors were constructed on site, while the casings and shafting were constructed in John Brown&#x27;s Atlas works in Sheffield. The machinery to drive the 56-ton rudder was constructed by Brown Brothers of Edinburgh. A main steering engine drove the rudder through worm gear and clutch operating on a toothed quadrant rack, with a reserve engine operating separately on the rack via a chain drive for emergency use. The three-bladed propellers were fitted and then cased in wood to protect them during the launch.

The ship was launched on 7 June 1906, eight weeks later than planned due to labour strikes and eight months after Lord Inverclyde&#x27;s death. Princess Louise was invited to name the ship but could not attend, so the honour fell to Inverclyde&#x27;s widow Mary. The launch was attended by 600 invited guests and thousands of spectators. One thousand tons of drag chains were attached to the hull by temporary rings to slow it once it entered the water. The wooden supporting structure was held back by cables so that once the ship entered the water it would slip forward out of its support. Six tugs were on hand to capture the hull and move it to the fitting out berth.
Testing of the ship&#x27;s engines took place in June 1907 prior to full trials scheduled for July. A preliminary cruise, or &quot;Builder&#x27;s Trial&quot;, was arranged for 27 July with representatives of Cunard, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and John Brown aboard. The ship achieved speeds of over a measured at Skelmorlie with turbines running at 194 revolutions per minute producing 76,000 shp. At high speeds the ship was found to suffer such vibration at the stern as to render the second-class accommodation uninhabitable. VIP invited guests now came on board for a two-day shakedown cruise during which the ship was tested under continuous running at speeds of 15, 18 and 21 knots but not her maximum speed. On 29 July, the guests departed and three days of full trials commenced. The ship travelled four times between the Corsewall Light off Scotland to the Longship Light off Cornwall at 23 and 25 knots, between the Corsewall Light and the Isle of Man, and the Isle of Arran and Ailsa Craig. Over an average speed of 25.4 knots was achieved, comfortably greater than the 24 knots required under the Admiralty contract. The ship could stop in 4 minutes in 3/4 of a mile starting from 23 knots at 166 rpm and then applying full reverse. She achieved a speed of 26 knots over a measured mile loaded to a draught of , and managed 26.5 knots over a course drawing . At 180 revolutions a turning test was conducted and the ship performed a complete circle of diameter 1000 yards in 50 seconds. The rudder required 20 seconds to be turned hard to 35 degrees.

The vibration was determined to be caused by interference between the wake of the outer propellers and inner and became worse when turning. At high speeds the vibration frequency resonated with the ship&#x27;s stern making the matter worse. The solution was to add internal stiffening to the stern of the ship but this necessitated gutting the second-class areas and then rebuilding them. This required the addition of a number of pillars and arches to the decorative scheme. The ship was finally delivered to Cunard on 26 August although the problem of vibration was never entirely solved and further remedial work went on throughout her life.

===Comparison with the &quot;Olympic&quot; class===
The White Star Line&#x27;s vessels were almost longer and slightly wider than &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;. This made the White Star vessels about 15,000 tons larger than the Cunard vessels. Both &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; were launched and had been in service for several years before &quot;Olympic&quot;, and &quot;Britannic&quot; were ready for the North Atlantic run. Although significantly faster than the &quot;Olympic&quot; class would be, the speed of Cunard&#x27;s vessels was not sufficient to allow the line to run a weekly two-ship transatlantic service from each side of the Atlantic. A third ship was needed for a weekly service, and in response to White Star&#x27;s announced plan to build the three &quot;Olympic&quot;-class ships, Cunard ordered a third ship: . Like , Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Aquitania&quot; had a lower service speed, but was a larger and more luxurious vessel.

Due to their increased size the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class liners could offer many more amenities than &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;. Both &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; offered swimming pools, Victorian-style Turkish baths, a gymnasium, a squash court, large reception rooms, À la Carte restaurants separate from the dining saloons, and many more staterooms with private bathroom facilities than their two Cunard rivals.

Heavy vibrations as a by-product of the four steam turbines on &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; would plague both ships throughout their voyages. When &quot;Lusitania&quot; sailed at top speed the resultant vibrations were so severe that second- and third-class sections of the ship could become uninhabitable. In contrast, the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class liners used two traditional reciprocating engines and only one turbine for the central propeller, which greatly reduced vibration. Because of their greater tonnage and wider beam, the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class liners were also more stable at sea and less prone to rolling. &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; both featured straight prows in contrast to the angled prows of the &quot;Olympic&quot; class. Designed so that the ships could plunge through a wave rather than crest it, the unforeseen consequence was that the Cunard liners would pitch forward alarmingly, even in calm weather, allowing huge waves to splash the bow and forward part of the superstructure. This would be a major factor in damage that &quot;Lusitania&quot; suffered at the hands of a rogue wave in January 1910.

The vessels of the &quot;Olympic&quot; class also differed from &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; in the way in which they were compartmented below the waterline. The White Star vessels were divided by transverse watertight bulkheads. While &quot;Lusitania&quot; also had transverse bulkheads, it also had longitudinal bulkheads running along the ship on each side, between the boiler and engine rooms and the coal bunkers on the outside of the vessel. The British commission that had investigated the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912 heard testimony on the flooding of coal bunkers lying outside longitudinal bulkheads. Being of considerable length, when flooded, these could increase the ship&#x27;s list and &quot;make the lowering of the boats on the other side impracticable&quot;—and this was precisely what later happened with &quot;Lusitania&quot;. The ship&#x27;s stability was insufficient for the bulkhead arrangement used: flooding of only three coal bunkers on one side could result in negative metacentric height. On the other hand, &quot;Titanic&quot; was given ample stability and sank with only a few degrees list, the design being such that there was very little risk of unequal flooding and possible capsize.

&quot;Lusitania&quot; did not carry enough lifeboats for all her passengers, officers and crew on board at the time of her maiden voyage (carrying four lifeboats fewer than &quot;Titanic&quot; would carry in 1912). This was a common practice for large passenger ships at the time, since the belief was that in busy shipping lanes help would always be nearby and the few boats available would be adequate to ferry all aboard to rescue ships before a sinking. After the &quot;Titanic&quot; sank, &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; were equipped with an additional six clinker-built wooden boats under davits, making for a total of 22 boats rigged in davits. The rest of their lifeboat accommodations were supplemented with 26 collapsible lifeboats, 18 stored directly beneath the regular lifeboats and eight on the after deck. The collapsibles were built with hollow wooden bottoms and canvas sides, and needed assembly in the event they had to be used.

This contrasted with &quot;Olympic&quot; and which received a full complement of lifeboats all rigged under davits. This difference would have been a major contributor to the high loss of life involved with &quot;Lusitania&quot;″s sinking, since there was not sufficient time to assemble collapsible boats or life-rafts, had it not been for the fact that the ship&#x27;s severe listing made it impossible for lifeboats on the port side of the vessel to be lowered, and the rapidity of the sinking did not allow the remaining lifeboats that could be directly lowered (as these were rigged under davits) to be filled and launched with passengers. When &quot;Britannic&quot;, working as a hospital ship during World War I, sank in 1916 after hitting a mine in the Kea Channel the already davited boats were swiftly lowered saving nearly all on board, but the ship took nearly three times as long to sink as &quot;Lusitania&quot; and thus the crew had more time to evacuate passengers.

==Career==
&quot;Lusitania&quot;, commanded by Commodore James Watt, moored at the Liverpool landing stage for her maiden voyage at 4:30 pm on Saturday 7 September 1907 as the onetime Blue Riband holder vacated the pier. At the time &quot;Lusitania&quot; was the largest ocean liner in service and would continue to be until the introduction of &quot;Mauretania&quot; in November that year. A crowd of 200,000 people gathered to see her departure at 9:00 pm for Queenstown, where she was to take on more passengers. She anchored again at Roche&#x27;s Point, off Queenstown, at 9:20 am the following morning, where she was shortly joined by &quot;Lucania&quot;, which she had passed in the night, and 120 passengers were brought out to the ship by tender bringing her total of passengers to 2,320.

At 12:10 pm on Sunday &quot;Lusitania&quot; was again under way and passing the Daunt Rock Lightship. In the first 24 hours she achieved , with further daily totals of 575, 570, 593 and before arriving at Sandy Hook at 9:05 am Friday 13 September, taking in total 5 days and 54 minutes, 30 minutes outside the record time held by of the North German Lloyd line. Fog had delayed the ship on two days, and her engines were not yet run in. In New York hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the bank of the Hudson River from Battery Park to pier 56. All New York&#x27;s police had been called out to control the crowd. From the start of the day, 100 horse-drawn cabs had been queuing, ready to take away passengers. During the week&#x27;s stay the ship was made available for guided tours. At 3 pm on Saturday 21 September, the ship departed on the return journey, arriving Queenstown 4 am 27 September and Liverpool 12 hours later. The return journey was 5 days 4 hours and 19 minutes, again delayed by fog.

On her second voyage in better weather, &quot;Lusitania&quot; arrived at Sandy Hook on 11 October 1907 in the Blue Riband record time of 4 days, 19 hours and 53 minutes. She had to wait for the tide to enter harbour where news had preceded her and she was met by a fleet of small craft, whistles blaring. &quot;Lusitania&quot; averaged westbound and eastbound. In December 1907, &quot;Mauretania&quot; entered service and took the record for the fastest eastbound crossing. &quot;Lusitania&quot; made her fastest westbound crossing in 1909 after her propellers were changed, averaging . She briefly recovered the record in July of that year, but &quot;Mauretania&quot; recaptured the Blue Riband the same month, retaining it until 1929, when it was taken by . During her eight-year service, she made a total of 201 crossings on the Cunard Line&#x27;s Liverpool-New York Route, carrying a total of 155,795 passengers westbound and another 106,180 eastbound.

===Hudson Fulton Celebration===

&quot;Lusitania&quot; and other ships participated in the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York City from the end of September to early October 1909. The celebration was also a display of the different modes of transportation then in existence, &quot;Lusitania&quot; representing the newest advancement in steamship technology. A newer mode of travel was the aeroplane. Wilbur Wright had brought a Flyer to Governors Island and made demonstration flights before millions of New Yorkers who had never seen an aeroplane. Some of Wright&#x27;s trips were directly over &quot;Lusitania&quot;; several photographs of &quot;Lusitania&quot; from that week still exist.

==Rogue wave crash==
On 10 January 1910, &quot;Lusitania&quot; was on a voyage from Liverpool to New York, when, two days into the trip, she encountered a rogue wave that was high. The design of the ship&#x27;s bow allowed her to break through waves instead of riding on top of them. This, however, came with a cost, as the wave rolled over the bow and slammed into the bridge. As a result, the forecastle deck was damaged, the bridge windows were smashed, the bridge was shifted a couple of inches aft, and both the deck and the bridge were given a permanent depression of a few inches. No one was injured, and the &quot;Lusitania&quot; continued on as normal, albeit arriving a few hours late in New York with some shaken-up passengers.

==Outbreak of the First World War==
When &quot;Lusitania&quot; was built, her construction and operating expenses were subsidised by the British government, with the proviso that she could be converted to an armed merchant cruiser (AMC) if need be. A secret compartment was designed in for the purpose of carrying arms and ammunition. When war was declared she was considered for requisition by the British Admiralty as an armed merchant cruiser, and she was put on the official list of AMCs. Though she was not ultimately requisitioned or armed, &quot;Lusitania&quot; remained on the official AMC list and was listed as an auxiliary cruiser in the 1914 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot;, along with &quot;Mauretania&quot;.

Despite failed attempts to codify formally (such as the 1909 London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War) prior to the start of WWI, according to international customary law the treatment of civilian vessels in war is governed by the so-called Cruiser Rules. These required that the lives of the crew and passengers be safeguarded when the ship is confiscated or sunk, unless out of urgent, unforeseen reasons of strict military necessity out of the control of the belligerent (such as forcible resistance), this is not possible.

Regardless of these rules, at the outbreak of hostilities, fears for the safety of &quot;Lusitania&quot; and other great liners ran high. During the ship&#x27;s first east-bound crossing after the war started, she was painted in a grey colour scheme in an attempt to mask her identity and make her more difficult to detect visually.

Many of the large liners were laid up in 1914–1915, in part due to falling demand for passenger travel across the Atlantic, and in part to protect them from damage due to mines or other dangers. Among the most recognisable of these liners, some were eventually used as troop transports, while others became hospital ships. &quot;Lusitania&quot; remained in commercial service; although bookings aboard her were by no means strong during that autumn and winter, demand was strong enough to keep her in civilian service. Economising measures were taken. One of these was the shutting down of her No. 4 boiler room to conserve coal and crew costs; this reduced her maximum speed from over to . With apparent dangers evaporating, the ship&#x27;s disguised paint scheme was also dropped and she was returned to civilian colours. Her name was picked out in gilt, her funnels were repainted in their normal Cunard livery, and her superstructure was painted white again. One alteration was the addition of a bronze/gold-coloured band around the base of the superstructure just above the black paint.

==1915==


By early 1915, a new threat began to materialise: submarines. On 4 February 1915, Germany declared the seas around Great Britain and Ireland a war zone: from 18 February Allied ships in the area would be sunk without warning. This was not wholly unrestricted submarine warfare as efforts would be taken to avoid sinking neutral ships, but &quot;enemy&quot; passenger craft were included as targets, despite the demand of the US for &quot;strict accountability&quot;. Indeed, as U-boat success rates were lower than expected, rules of engagement were loosened in April, encouraging the making of &quot;mistakes&quot;.

On her next arrival at Liverpool, on 6 February, &quot;Lusitania&quot; arrived in Liverpool flying the neutral US ensign, which had been raised off southern Ireland, causing controversy.

&quot;Lusitania&quot; was next scheduled to arrive in Liverpool on 6 March 1915. The Admiralty issued her specific instructions on how to avoid submarines. Such advice added to earlier advice following the declaration of the &quot;war zone&quot; that ships should try to evade submarines if possible or steer towards them to force them to dive, instructions that some argue may compromise the ship&#x27;s rights under cruiser rules. Admiral Henry Oliver ordered HMS &quot;Louis&quot; and HMS &quot;Laverock&quot; to escort &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and took the further precaution of sending the Q-ship HMS &quot;Lyons&quot; to patrol Liverpool Bay. Due to a communications issue, Captain Daniel Dow did not make contact with the destroyers but proceeded to Liverpool unescorted.

Some alterations were made to the ship&#x27;s protocols. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the war zone. It was also suggested that her funnels were most likely painted dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. Clearly, there was no hope of disguising her identity, as her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to paint out the ship&#x27;s name at the bow. Captain Dow was replaced by Captain William Thomas Turner, who had previously commanded &quot;Lusitania&quot;, &quot;Mauretania&quot;, and &quot;Aquitania&quot; in the years before the war.

On 17 April 1915, &quot;Lusitania&quot; left Liverpool on her 201st transatlantic voyage, arriving in New York on 24 April. On 22 April, the German Embassy under Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff submitted a general warning about travel to 50 American newspapers, including those in New York, which coincidentally appeared in newspapers just before the ship sailed.

The ship departed Pier 54 in New York, on 1 May 1915 at 12:20 pm, on what would be her final voyage. A few hours after the vessel&#x27;s departure, the Saturday evening edition of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published two articles on its front page, both referring to the previous day&#x27;s warnings.

==Sinking==

On 7 May 1915, &quot;Lusitania&quot; was nearing the end of her 202nd crossing, bound for Liverpool from New York, and was scheduled to dock at the Prince&#x27;s Landing Stage later that afternoon. Aboard her were 1,264 passengers, 3 stowaways and a crew of 693, totalling 1,960 people. She was running parallel to the south coast of Ireland, and was roughly off the Old Head of Kinsale when the liner crossed in front of at 2:10 pm. Walther Schwieger, the commanding officer of the U-boat, who claimed not to have identified the ship, gave the order to fire one torpedo. He reported that it struck &quot;Lusitania&quot; on the starboard bow, just behind the bridge. Moments later, a second explosion erupted from within &quot;Lusitania&quot;″s hull where the torpedo had struck, and the ship began to founder rapidly, with a prominent list to starboard.

Almost immediately, the crew scrambled to launch the lifeboats but the conditions of the sinking made their usage extremely difficult, and in some cases impossible because of the ship&#x27;s severe list. In all, only six out of 48 lifeboats were launched successfully, with several more overturning and breaking apart. 18 minutes after the torpedo struck, the ship&#x27;s trim levelled out and she sank at position , with the funnels and masts the last to disappear. Of the 1,960 passengers and crew aboard &quot;Lusitania&quot; at the time of the sinking, 1,197 lost their lives. In the hours after the sinking, acts of heroism amongst both the survivors of the sinking and the Irish rescuers who had heard word of &quot;Lusitania&quot;″s distress signals brought the survivor count to 767, four of whom later died from injuries sustained during the sinking. sortied briefly in contravention of Royal Navy policy, but turned back believing erroneously (as initial reports suggested) that there was no &quot;urgent necessity&quot;.

By the following morning, the true scope of the disaster had spread around the world. While most of those lost in the sinking were British or Canadians, the loss of 128 Americans in the disaster, including writer and publisher Elbert Hubbard, millionaire hotelier and builder Albert Clay Bilicke, theatrical producer Charles Frohman, multi-millionaire businessman Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, and the president of Newport News Shipbuilding, Albert L. Hopkins, outraged many in the United States.

==Aftermath==
The sinking caused an international outcry, especially in Britain and across the British Empire, as well as in the United States, since 128 out of 159 U.S. citizens aboard the ship lost their lives (different numbers were believed and given in the media at the time). On 8 May, Bernhard Dernburg, an unofficial German spokesman and a former German Colonial Secretary, said that because &quot;Lusitania&quot; &quot;carried contraband of war&quot; and also because &quot;she was classed as an auxiliary cruiser,&quot; Germany had a right to destroy her regardless of any passengers aboard. Dernburg claimed warnings given by the German Embassy before the sailing, plus the 18 February note declaring the existence of &quot;war zones&quot;, relieved Germany of any responsibility for the deaths of American citizens aboard. He referred to the ammunition and military goods declared on &quot;Lusitania&quot;″s manifest and said that &quot;vessels of that kind&quot; could be seized and destroyed under the Hague Rules. Concurrently, on the advice of Admiral Tirpitz, Germany adopted a similar official line to &quot;incite public opinion at home&quot;.

&quot;Lusitania&quot; was indeed officially listed as an auxiliary war ship, though contrary to Germany&#x27;s claims she was not armed, and her cargo had included an estimated 4,200,000 rounds of rifle cartridges, 1,250 empty shell cases, and 18 cases of non-explosive fuzes, which was openly listed as such in her cargo manifest. The day after the sinking, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published full details of the ship&#x27;s military cargo. Assistant Manager of the Cunard Line, Herman Winter, denied the charge that she carried munitions, but admitted that she was carrying small-arms ammunition, and that she had been carrying such ammunition for years. The fact that &quot;Lusitania&quot; had been carrying shells and cartridges could not be openly discussed in the British press at the time. In the 27-page additional manifest, delivered to U.S. customs 4–5 days after &quot;Lusitania&quot; sailed from New York, and in the Bethlehem Steels papers, it is stated that the &quot;empty shells&quot; were in fact 1,248 boxes of filled (with metal shrapnel) 3&quot; shell, 4 shells to the box, totalling 103,000 pounds or 50 tonnes.

In the United States, public opinion was outraged; war talk was rife and pro-German elements kept quiet. The key issue was the savagery in the German failure to allow passengers to escape on life boats as required by international law, and Germany&#x27;s attempts to defend the attack only increased anger. In Germany, many newspapers celebrated the event as a triumph, though allied propaganda at times exaggerated the level of popular support.

During the weeks after the sinking, the issue was hotly debated within the U.S. government, and correspondence was exchanged between the U.S. and German governments. German officials continued to argue that &quot;Lusitania&quot; was a legitimate military target. German Foreign Minister Von Jagow cited the claims that she was listed as an armed merchant cruiser, she was using neutral flags and she had been ordered to ram submarines—in contravention of the Cruiser Rules. Von Jagow further alleged that &quot;Lusitania&quot; had on previous voyages carried munitions and Allied troops. Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz stated it was sad that many Americans &quot;in wanton recklessness, and in spite of the warnings of our Ambassador, had embarked in this armed cruiser, heavily laden with munitions&quot; and had died, but that Germany had been within her rights to sink the ship.

President Woodrow Wilson saw his main goal as to negotiate an end to the war. He was given contradictory advice: Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan privately advised President Wilson that &quot;ships carrying contraband should be prohibited from carrying passengers.&quot; However Counselor Robert Lansing, an expert on international law, advised Wilson to adhere to the US&#x27;s prior position of &quot;strict accountability&quot;. All that mattered, according to Lansing, was the German responsibility for the safety of the unresisting crew and passengers of the ship. Once it was confirmed that the ship was not armed and was attacked by surprise, no warning or strategic justification can allow the violation of &quot;the principles of law and humanity&quot;, and the US was already committed to this approach. Wilson would adopt Lansing&#x27;s view, insisting the German government apologise for the sinking, compensate U.S. victims, and promise to avoid any similar occurrence in the future. Bryan would resign, believing Wilson&#x27;s approach to compromise American neutrality, to be replaced by Lansing as Secretary of State.

Despite all these facts and arguments, Germany had already declared in February that all allied ships in the area would be sunk, regardless of whether they carried munitions or not. Indeed, the strategic aim of Admiral Hugo von Pohl&#x27;s U-boat campaign was economic warfare against Britain, not the interception of weapons or destruction of war vessels. As in the case of the British naval blockade of Germany, &quot;contraband of war&quot; had expanded, in practice, to include essentially all cargo. U-20 herself had sunk two other vessel en route &quot;out&quot; of Liverpool, making questions of intercepting munitions moot. In addition, in a 12 February order to U-boat captains, Gustav Bachmann had directed that enemy passenger vessels should be deliberately targeted, so as to create a &quot;shock effect&quot;. Thus, while outwardly Germany conducted a propaganda skirmish, within Germany there was a fierce debate, as officials were keenly aware that further sinkings were likely, including ones where Germany&#x27;s excuses did not apply. Hence secret orders were issued in June that rescinded Bachmann&#x27;s orders and stated that unrestricted submarine warfare on ocean liners would cease. Tirpitz and Bachmann offered their resignations, but they were rejected by the Kaiser.

Yet, other passenger ships continued to be attacked and sometimes sunk, such as the and . Targeting of ships such as &quot;Lusitania&quot; would only formally end with the sinking of the westward-sailing ocean liner , with a German decision on 9 September 1915 that stated that attacks were only allowed on ships that were definitely British, while neutral ships were to be treated under the Prize Law rules, and no attacks on passenger liners were to be permitted at all.

In January 1917, the German government announced it would again conduct full unrestricted submarine warfare. This together with the Zimmermann Telegram pushed U.S. public opinion over the tipping point, and on 6 April 1917 the United States Congress followed President Wilson&#x27;s request to declare war on Germany.

After the war American interests sued the German government for compensation. In 1923, 278 claimants were initially awarded $ (equivalent to $ in ). On 23 February 1924, it was reported that Judge Edwin B. Parker, umpire of the American–German mixed claims commission, denied 40 claims and settled on a final payout of $841,000 ($ in ). 

In the years since, the sinking has given rise to a number of conspiracy theories, centering around placing blame for the incident on the British government. In 2014 a release of papers revealed that in 1982 the British government warned salvage divers of the possible presence of explosives on board. Senior diplomat Noel Marshall wrote in a memo that &quot;Successive British governments have always maintained that there was no munitions on board the &quot;Lusitania&quot; (and that the Germans were therefore in the wrong to claim to the contrary as an excuse for sinking the ship) ... The facts are that there is a large amount of ammunition in the wreck, some of which is highly dangerous.&quot; After a search of records, the Ministry of Defence said they could find no evidence to substantiate the rumours of a secret munitions store, and the internal inquiry concluded that the &quot;Lusitania&quot; was not carrying any explosives or any &quot;special ammunition&quot;. But it was still felt to be prudent to warn the salvage company of the &quot;obvious but real danger inherent if explosives did happen to be present&quot;, accepting that &quot;always been public knowledge that the Lusitania&#x27;s cargo included some 5,000 cases of small arms ammunition.&quot; No explosives were found by the salvage company.

===100th commemoration===

To commemorate the centenary of the sinking, on 3 May 2015 a small fleet of ships sailed from the Isle of Man. Seven fishermen from Man, in their boat &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, had rescued 150 people from the &quot;Lusitania&quot; and were awarded medals for their participation. Two of these medals can be seen at the Leece Museum in Peel.

The 100th commemoration of the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; was on 7 May 2015. To commemorate the occasion, Cunard&#x27;s undertook a voyage to Cork, Ireland.

==Wreck==
The wreck of &quot;Lusitania&quot; was located on 6 October 1935, south of the lighthouse at Kinsale. She lies on her starboard side at about a 30-degree angle, in roughly of water. The wreck is badly collapsed onto its starboard side, due to the force with which it struck the bottom coupled with the forces of winter tides and corrosion in the decades since the sinking. The keel has an &quot;unusual curvature&quot; which may be related to a lack of strength from the loss of its superstructure. The beam is reduced with the funnels missing—presumably due to deterioration.

The bow is the most prominent portion of the wreck with the stern damaged by depth charges. Three of the four propellers were removed by Oceaneering International in 1982 for display, though one was melted down. Expeditions to &quot;Lusitania&quot; have shown that the ship has deteriorated much faster than &quot;Titanic&quot; has, being in a depth of of water. When contrasted with her contemporary, &quot;Titanic&quot; (resting at a depth of ), &quot;Lusitania&quot; appears in a much more deteriorated state due to the presence of fishing nets lying on the wreckage, the blasting of the wreck with depth charges and multiple salvage operations. As a result, the wreck is unstable and may at some point completely collapse. There has been recent academic commentary exploring the possibility of listing the wreck site as a World Heritage Site under the World Heritage Convention, although challenges remain in terms of ownership and preventing further deterioration of the wreck.

===Simon Lake&#x27;s attempt to salvage in the 1930s===
Between 1931 and 1935, an American syndicate comprising Simon Lake, an important submarine inventor, and a US Navy officer, Captain H.H. Railey, negotiated a contract with the British Admiralty and other British authorities to partially salvage &quot;Lusitania&quot;. The means of salvage was unique in that a steel tube, five feet in diameter, which enclosed stairs, and a dive chamber at the bottom would be floated out over the &quot;Lusitania&quot; wreck and then sunk upright, with the dive chamber resting on the main deck of &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Divers would then take the stairs down to the dive chamber and then go out of the chamber to the deck of &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Lake&#x27;s primary business goals were to salvage the purser&#x27;s safe and any items of historical value. It was not to be though, and in Simon Lake&#x27;s own words, &quot;... but my hands were too full&quot;—i.e. Lake&#x27;s company was having financial difficulties at the time—and the contract with British authorities expired 31 December 1935 without any salvage work being done, even though his unique salvage tunnel had been built and tested.

=== Argonaut expedition, 1935 ===

In 1935 a Glasgow-based expedition was launched to try to find the wreck of &quot;Lusitania&quot;. The Argonaut Corporation Ltd was founded and the salvage ship &quot;Orphir&quot; used to search for the ship. After three months of searching the wreck was discovered on 6 October 1935. Diver Jim Jarrett wore a Tritonia diving suit to explore the wreck at a depth of 93 metres.

===Gregg Bemis&#x27;s salvage efforts===
In 1967, the wreck of &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sold by the Liverpool &amp; London War Risks Insurance Association to former US Navy diver John Light (1932–1992) for £1,000. American venture capitalist Gregg Bemis (1928–2020) became a co-owner of the wreck in 1968, and by 1982 had bought out his partners to become sole owner. Complex litigation ensued when employees of Bemis brought various artifacts ashore into the UK, with all parties settling their differences apart from the salvors and the British government, which asserted &quot;droits of admiralty&quot; over the recovered items. The judge eventually ruled in &quot;The Lusitania&quot;, [1986] QB 384, [1986] 1 All ER 1011, that the Crown has no rights over wrecks outside British territorial waters, even if the recovered items are subsequently brought into the United Kingdom. , the case remained the leading authority on this point of law. However, a subsequent US court case where Bemis attempted to stop others from diving the wreck found that Bemis had no ownership over the personal effects and cargo on board the ship.

In 1993, Bemis granted permission to Titanic wreck explorer Robert Ballard to explore the wreck. Ballard attempted to prove that the ship was sunk by the explosion of illegal explosives. The exploration was difficult, hampered by snagged fishing nets and the presence of unexploded depth charges. While the ship was lying on her starboard side and so he was not able to access the area of the torpedo strike, he was able to use ROVs to examine under the bow. He found that the entire exposed area of the cargo hold was &quot;clearly undamaged&quot;, concluding that no secondary explosion took place there and that a coal dust explosion was likely responsible instead. Bemis rejected his findings and continued to research the wreck.

Bemis then faced more serious litigation on the issue of artifact recovery occurred versus Ireland. This was because in 1995 the Irish Government declared the &quot;Lusitania&quot; a heritage site under the National Monuments Act, which prohibited him from in any way interfering with her or her contents. After a protracted legal wrangle, the Supreme Court in Dublin overturned the Arts and Heritage Ministry&#x27;s previous refusal to issue Bemis with a five-year exploration licence in 2007, ruling that the then minister for Arts and Heritage had misconstrued the law when he refused Bemis&#x27;s 2001 application. Bemis planned to dive and recover and analyse whatever artefacts and evidence could help piece together the story of what happened to the ship. He said that any items found would be given to museums following analysis. Any fine art recovered—such as the paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt and Monet, among other artists, believed to have been in lead tubes in the possession of Sir Hugh Lane—would remain in the ownership of the Irish Government.

In late July 2008, Bemis was granted an &quot;imaging&quot; licence by the Department of the Environment, which allowed him to photograph and film the entire wreck, and was to allow him to produce the first high-resolution pictures of her. Bemis planned to use the data gathered to assess how fast the wreck was deteriorating and to plan a strategy for a forensic examination of the ship, which he estimated would cost $5m. Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration (OME) was contracted by Bemis to conduct the survey. The Department of the Environment&#x27;s Underwater Archaeology Unit was to join the survey team to ensure that research would be carried out in a non-invasive manner, and a film crew from the Discovery Channel was also to be on hand. A dive team from Cork Sub Aqua Club, diving under licence, discovered 15,000 rounds of the .303 (7.7×56mmR) calibre rifle ammunition transported on &quot;Lusitania&quot; in boxes in the bow section of the ship. The find was photographed but left &quot;in situ&quot; under the terms of the licence.

Results from the dives were provided to researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who in 2012 concluded that this showed that the ship was sunk mainly by the effect of the torpedo, with a secondary explosion due to the boilers that did not significantly affect subsequent events. Bemis rejected the findings.

Continuing to attempt to prove British involvement, in July 2016, Bemis&#x27;s diving partner Eoin McGarry attempted to recover but lost a telegraph machine from the ship. This caused controversy as the dive was unsupervised by anyone with archaeological expertise. In November 2018, Bemis was interviewed for one hour on live radio about the &quot;Lusitania&quot; about some of the logistical complications in conducting a maritime archaeological expedition to penetrate the hull. He claimed that some of the original art presumed to be lost in wreckage may not have been, and discussed his continuing belief that Churchill caused the sinking.

In 2020, Bemis passed away. Despite millions of dollars spent, he was never able to find proof of his conspiracy theory. The wreck is currently owned by a museum in Kinsale, Ireland.

===Diving accidents===
A number of technical divers attempting to dive at the &quot;Lusitania&quot; wreckage site have been seriously injured. Regardless of the unconfirmed presence of secret WWI explosives, mixed gases must be used to reach the wreckage, which purportedly is littered with British depth charges and hedgehog mines, covered in fishing nets, and where sediment limits visibility.

<text>Cupressus is one of several genera of evergreen conifers within the family Cupressaceae that have the common name cypress; for the others, see cypress. It is considered a polyphyletic group. Based on genetic and morphological analysis, the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot; is found in the subfamily Cupressoideae. The common name &quot;cypress&quot; comes via the Old French from the Latin , which is the latinisation of the Greek κυπάρισσος (&quot;kypárissos&quot;).

==Description==
Cypress are evergreen trees or large shrubs, growing to tall, exceptionally up to 102 m tall (the second-tallest tree species on earth, after &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) in &quot;Cupressus austrotibetica&quot;. The leaves are scale-like, 2–6 mm long, arranged in opposite decussate pairs, and persist for three to five years. On young plants up to two years old, the leaves are needle-like and 5–15 mm long. The cones are 8–40 mm long, globose or ovoid with 4 to 14 scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs; they are mature in 18–24 months from pollination. The seeds are small, 4–7 mm long, with two narrow wings, one along each side of the seed.

Many of the species are adapted to forest fires, holding their seeds for many years in closed cones until the parent trees are killed by a fire; the seeds are then released to colonise the bare, burnt ground. In other species, the cones open at maturity to release the seeds.

==Distribution==
As currently treated, these cypresses are native to scattered localities in mainly warm temperate regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including northwest Africa, the Middle East, the Himalayas, southern China and northern Vietnam. As with other conifers, extensive cultivation has led to a wide variety of forms, sizes and colours, that are grown in parks and gardens throughout the world.

==Cultivation==
Many species of cypress are grown as decorative trees in parks and, in Asia, around temples; in some areas, the native distribution is hard to discern due to extensive cultivation. A few species are grown for their timber, which can be very durable. The fast-growing hybrid Leyland cypress (&quot;Cupressus&quot; × &quot;leylandii&quot;), much used in gardens, draws one of its parents from this genus (&quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot;, Monterey cypress); the other parent, &quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot; (Nootka cypress), is also sometimes classified in this genus, or else in the separate genus &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot;, but in the past more usually in &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;.

== Cultural references ==
It was believed in the Hellenic culture that the cypress tree was sacred to the gods and it is now used as an emblem of grief. 
The name of the genus comes from Cyparissus, a young man loved by Apollo, very attached to a deer which he ended up killing by mistake during a hunting trip. To ease the pain Apollo transformed the boy into a plant.
The association with mourning continued in Roman times, up to the present day, also for a practical reason: the roots of the cypress are straight into the ground, and expand slightly laterally, not damaging the burials.

== Taxonomy ==
There has long been significant uncertainty about the New World members of &quot;Cupressus&quot;, with several studies recovering them as forming a distinct clade from the Old World members. A 2021 molecular study found &quot;Cupressus&quot; to be the sister genus to &quot;Juniperus&quot;, whereas the western members (classified in &quot;Callitropsis&quot; and &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot;) were found to be sister to &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
===Species===
The number of species recognised within this genus varies sharply, from 16 to 25 or more according to the authority followed, because most populations are small and isolated, and whether they should be accorded specific, subspecific or varietal rank is difficult to ascertain. Current tendencies are to reduce the number of recognised species; when a narrow species concept is adopted, the varieties indented in the list below may also be accepted as distinct species. See also the New World species (below) for a likely split in the genus in the future.

====Old World species====
The Old World cypresses tend to have cones with more scales (8–14 scales, rarely 6 in &quot;C. funebris&quot;), each scale with a short broad ridge, not a spike. &quot;C. sempervirens&quot; is the type species of the genus, defining the name &quot;Cupressus&quot;. They are more closely related to &quot;Juniperus&quot; than to the New World species, with the exception of the Vietnamese golden cypress, which is more closely related to New World species.

==== New World species ====
The New World cypresses tend to have cones with fewer scales (4–8 scales, rarely more in &quot;C. macrocarpa&quot;), each scale with an often prominent narrow spike. Recent genetic evidence shows they are less closely related to the Old World cypresses than previously thought, being more closely related to &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; than to the rest of &quot;Cupressus&quot;. These species have recently been transferred to &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot; and &quot;Callitropsis&quot;. New World species are found in marginal habitats with xeric soils, and therefore exhibit a fragmented allopatric pattern of distribution. This type of distribution results in disproportionate local abundance with most species restricted to small neighboring populations.

==Allergenic potential==
All plants in the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot;, including New World &quot;Cupressus&quot; (now &quot;Callitropsis&quot;), are extremely allergenic, and have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10. In warm, Mediterranean climates, these plants release large quantities of pollen for approximately seven months each year.

<doc id="436118" wikidata="Q3636393" url="?curid=436118" title="Battle of Chunuk Bair">
<text>The Battle of Chunuk Bair () was a World War I battle fought between the Ottoman defenders and troops of the British Empire over control of the peak in August 1915. The capture of Chunuk Bair, ( Basin Slope, now &quot;Conk Bayırı&quot;), the secondary peak of the Sari Bair range, was one of the two objectives of the Battle of Sari Bair.

British units that reached the summit of Chunuk Bair early on 8 August 1915 to engage the Turks were the Wellington Battalion of the New Zealand and Australian Division, 7th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment; and 8th (Service) Battalion, Welch Regiment, both of the 13th (Western) Division. The troops were reinforced in the afternoon by two squads of the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment, also part of the New Zealand and Australian Division. The first troops on the summit were severely depleted by Ottoman return fire and were relieved at 10:30pm on 8 August by the Otago Battalion (NZ), and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, New Zealand and Australian Division. The New Zealand troops were relieved by 8:00pm on 9 August by the 6th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment, and 5th Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment, who were massacred and driven off the summit in the early morning of 10 August, by an Ottoman counter-attack led by Mustafa Kemal.

The British August Offensive at Anzac Cove and Suvla was an attempt to try to break the stalemate that the Gallipoli Campaign had become. The capture of Chunuk Bair was the only success for the Allies of the campaign but it was fleeting as the position proved untenable. The Ottomans recaptured the peak for good a few days later.

==Background==
===August offensive===
The failure of the Allies to capture Krithia or make any progress on the Cape Helles front, led General Ian Hamilton, commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) to pursue a new plan to secure the Sari Bair Range and capture the high ground of and Chunuk Bair. Both sides had been reinforced, with Hamilton&#x27;s original five divisions increased to 15 divisions and the six original Ottoman divisions having grown to a force of 16 divisions. The British planned to land two fresh infantry divisions from IX Corps (Lieutenant-General Frederick Stopford), at Suvla, north of Anzac, followed by an advance on Sari Bair from the north-west to .

==Prelude==

===Anzac plan of attack ===
At Anzac an offensive would be made against the Sari Bair range by the New Zealand and Australian Division (Major-General Alexander Godley) on the northern flank advancing through rough and thinly defended terrain north of the Anzac perimeter. The division had been reinforced with most of the 13th (Western) Division (Lieutenant-General F. C. Shaw), the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade and the Indian Mountain Artillery Brigade, to about infantry. The attack would be conducted by a Right Assaulting Column up Rhododendron Spur to Chunuk Bair and the Left Assaulting Column would divide at Aghyl Dere and half would advance across Damakjelik Spur and Azma Dere to the Abdul Rahman Spur and then attack Hill 971, the other part of the force would move to the right up Damakjelik Spur to Hill Q. To prevent delays, a Right Covering Force was to take Destroyer Hill, Table top, Old No 3 Post and Bauchop&#x27;s Hill and the Left Covering Force was to reach Walden Point, cross Aghyl Dere and take Damakjelik Bair.

After the covering forces had captured their objectives by the attacking columns would advance at to reach the ridge an hour before dawn. Once Hill Q and Hill 971 had been captured, the Left Assaulting Column was to dig in and the Right Assaulting Column would consolidate Chunuk Bair and capture Battleship Hill, assisted by dawn attacks on the Nek and from the Nek from Russell&#x27;s Top, by dismounted Australian light horse from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, in concert with an attack on the summit of Chunuk Bair by soldiers from the New Zealand Infantry Brigade (Colonel Francis Johnston), who would traverse Rhododendron Spur, the Apex and the Farm. would be attacked by Gurkhas of the 29th Indian Brigade and Australians of the 4th Infantry Brigade.

===Ottoman defences===
The Ottoman senior commanders did not expect an attack at Chunuk Bair as it felt that the rugged terrain was unsuitable for an attack. However, the commanding officer of the section, Mustafa Kemal, commander of the Ottoman 19th Division, anticipated an attack. He felt that the peak of Chunuk Bair was especially vulnerable. He was unable to convince his superiors to significantly strengthen the defences.

==Battle==

===Rhododendron Spur===

The approach to the peak was made along Rhododendron Spur, which ran from the beach to the peak of Chunuk Bair. The Ottomans had outposts at specific points along the spur: at the Table Top, Destroyer Hill and nearest the beach at Old No. 3 Outpost. There was also an Ottoman outpost on Bauchop&#x27;s Hill to the north. All these outposts had to be cleared by the covering force, the four understrength regiments of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, before the main assault column could proceed up the spur to the summit.

The Auckland Mounted Rifles cleared Old No. 3 Outpost and the Wellington Mounted Rifles took Destroyer Hill and the Table Top. The Otago Mounted Rifles and Canterbury Mounted Rifles captured Bauchop&#x27;s Hill, which was named after the Otago&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Bauchop, who was killed during the attack. The fighting was heavy as the Ottomans had several machine guns in positions and the trenches were well protected. Ottoman wounded and prisoners were bayoneted after the fighting was over. In all the New Zealanders lost about 100 men in clearing the outposts. While the attack efforts were successful, the plan was now running two hours behind schedule, making it difficult to reach the summit before first light.

The advance was initially made up the valleys, or &quot;deres&quot;, on either side of Rhododendron Spur and once past the Table Top, the New Zealanders climbed onto the ridge, leaving about to travel to the summit.

The three battalions travelling along the north side of the spur were in position by 4:30am, shortly before dawn. They advanced to a knoll dubbed &quot;The Apex&quot; which was only about from the summit where at the time there were only a handful of Ottoman infantry, about 20. The Canterbury battalion on the south side of the spur was lost and delayed. Overall commander of the attack, Colonel Johnston, made the decision to wait for the last battalion to arrive before making the attack, disobeying original orders to not halt for any reason.

The attack on Chunuk Bair was the main element in a wider offensive. At 4:30am a supporting attack was planned at the Nek against Baby 700, intended to coincide with the New Zealanders attacking &quot;from&quot; Chunuk Bair down onto the rear of the Ottoman trenches on Battleship Hill. Despite the delay to the New Zealand attack, the Battle of the Nek went ahead nonetheless, with huge casualties.

===Chunuk Bair (&quot;Çanak Bayırı&quot;/&quot;Conk Bayırı&quot;)===
The opportunity for a swift victory at Chunuk Bair had been lost. With the failure of attack of the Nek and the realisation that Chunuk Bair was in danger of being overrun, the Ottomans reinforced the peak. At 7:30am, the New Zealanders were just away from the summit, but Ottoman and German reinforcements started arriving in heavy numbers. The commander of the Ottoman 9th Division, German Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Kannengiesser, had reached the summit and was preparing its defence. Kemal, the Ottoman colonel who had warned of the possibility of an attack, arrived soon after Kannengiesser. He ordered several regiments to the area. By 10:00am, the peaks had around 500 Ottoman reinforcements, whereas only hours ago, there had been just 20 sleeping soldiers. However, these reinforcements were spotted by Australian artillery observers, who pinned down movements by the Ottomans, some of whom fled down from the summit to better cover.

In daylight, after an exhausting climb and faced by stiffening opposition, the prospects for a New Zealand assault against the peak looked slim. Johnston requested to wait until nightfall. Nevertheless, General Godley ordered Johnston to attack.

Two hundred yards beyond where the New Zealanders were positioned on the Apex was another knoll called &quot;The Pinnacle&quot; from which it was a straight climb to the summit. Off the side of the spur to the north was a small, sheltered plateau known as The Farm.

Johnston told the Auckland battalion to attack and at 11:00am, they did. About 100 made it as far as the Pinnacle, where they desperately tried to dig in. Around 300 fell as casualties between there and the Apex. Johnston told the Wellington battalion to continue the attack. The battalion&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Malone refused, stating that he was not willing to order his men to carry out a hopeless attack. He said his battalion would take Chunuk Bair at night.

In 2018 New Zealand military historian Ian McGibbon challenged the &quot;myth&quot; that Colonel Malone had refused a direct order to make a daytime attack, holding that Malone and Johnston both disagreed with Godley&#x27;s order for the Auckland Battalion to attack in daylight, which dissention Johnston had reluctantly accepted. McGibbon said that the sole claim that Malone refused a direct order was made by NCO Charlie Clark in 1981. Malone had argued with a British officer, Major Arthur Temperley, who was Johnston&#x27;s brigade major but junior to Malone.

Two charges had been made before Godley finally called off the daytime attack. Hundreds of Anzacs lay dead and wounded before the peak.

Godley spent the rest of the day of 7 August devising a plan for another attack. He sent up reinforcements including the British 13th (Western) Division; the 7th Battalion of The Gloucestershire Regiment and the pioneers of 8th Battalion, the Welch Regiment, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Bald. The Auckland and Canterbury Infantry Battalions were removed from the plan of attack. They were replaced by the Otago and Wellington Infantry Battalions, which would lead the new attack. A 45-minute naval bombardment would start at 3:30 the next morning. Twelve machine guns would provide covering fire to the attacking forces.

Following a naval bombardment of the peak and a delay, the Wellingtons, followed by the Gloucesters, reached Chunuk Bair virtually unopposed. The preceding barrage had driven most of the Ottoman defenders away as the ground was too hard and rocky for deep entrenchments.

Chunuk Bair was hard to defend. It was only possible to scrape shallow trenches amongst the rocks, and the peak was exposed to fire from the main Ottoman line on Battleship Hill to the south and from Hill Q to the north. If the original plan for the offensive had worked, Hill Q would have been in Allied hands. Allanson&#x27;s battalion of Gurkhas reached it briefly the following day but were in no position to offer relief to the troops on Chunuk Bair.

By 5:00am, the Ottomans counter-attacked the Wellingtonians. The slope of the hill was so steep that the Ottomans could get within of the trenches without being seen. The New Zealanders fought desperately to hold off the Ottomans, firing their rifles and those of their fallen companions until the wood of the stock was too hot to touch. When the Ottomans got up to the trenches, the fighting continued with the bayonet. The Ottomans overran part of the New Zealand trench and took some prisoners. In full daylight, reinforcements were only reaching the summit at a trickle.

The fight raged all day until the trenches were clogged with the New Zealand dead. Around 5:00pm, Malone was killed by a misdirected artillery shell, fired from either Anzac artillery or a British ship.

The Ottomans had reclaimed the east side of the summit and were reinforced by the arrival of the 8th Division from Helles. As the extent of the Allied offensive became apparent, General Otto Liman von Sanders, the commander of the Ottoman forces in the Dardanelles, appointed his most competent officer, Colonel Mustafa Kemal, the commander for the defence of Suvla and Sari Bair.

As darkness fell on the evening of 8 August, the fighting subsided and the Wellington Battalion was relieved. Out of the 760 men of the battalion who had reached the summit, 711 had become casualties. Whereas Malone had resisted sending his men on a suicidal charge when told to follow the Auckland Battalion on 7 August, a day later the outcome would be the same. The New Army battalions had also suffered greatly. There were 417 casualties amongst the Welch pioneers and 350 amongst the Gloucesters, including all the officers of the battalion. For the wounded, the suffering was only beginning. Some took three days to travel from the higher reaches of Rhododendron Spur to the beach, a little over a kilometre away.

===The Farm===
Godley remained at his headquarters near the beach, largely ignorant of the state of the fighting. His plan for 9 August was to take Hill Q. The main force for the assault was a brigade commanded by Brigadier-General Anthony Baldwin. Baldwin commanded the 38th Brigade of the 13th Division but the situation was so confused that the force he led towards Hill Q contained only one of his normal battalions, the 6th East Lancashires. He also had the 9th Worcestershires and 9th Warwicks from the 39th Brigade and the 5th Wiltshires from the 40th Brigade (who would later be redirected to reinforce Chunuk Bair). Plus he led two 10th (Irish) Division battalions; the 10th Hampshires and 6th Royal Irish Rifles from the 29th Brigade. Most of the 10th Division had landed at Suvla on 7 August.
This force would climb to Hill Q from the Farm. At the same time, the New Zealanders on the right from Chunuk Bair and units of General Herbert Cox&#x27;s Indian Brigade on the left would also attack the hill. The plan failed when Baldwin&#x27;s battalions became lost in the dark trying to find the Farm which they did not reach until after dawn, around 6:00am. The only force to reach Hill Q was Allanson&#x27;s battalion of Gurkhas. They suffered the same fate as Colonel Malone, shelled by their own artillery, and their stay on the hill was brief.

With the offensive once again stalled, the New Zealanders on Chunuk Bair had to endure another day of Ottoman harassment. As night fell the remaining New Zealanders moved back to the Apex and were replaced by two New Army battalions, the 6th Battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment and some of the 5th Battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment from Baldwin&#x27;s force.

On the morning of 10 August Mustafa Kemal led an overwhelming Ottoman counter-attack. If Chunuk Bair, the one Allied success of the August offensive, was recaptured, the battle was effectively over. His plan lacked subtlety but was brutally effective – overrun the defenders by sheer weight of numbers. Mustafa Kemal had stopped the advance of IX Corps at Suvla, with a counter-attack at dawn on 9 August and late in the day reconnoitred Chunuk Bair and planned an attack with six battalions.

There were about 2,000 defenders on or below the summit of Chunuk Bair. Baldwin&#x27;s brigade at the Farm numbered a further 3,000. The Ottomans swept over the Lancashire battalion on the summit, few of whom survived (510 men were reported missing). The Wiltshires were unarmed and un-equipped and were scattered everywhere. On the right flank, the Ottomans captured the Pinnacle, driving the New Army troops before them. New Zealand machine gunners positioned at the Apex shot down the Ottomans as they tried to continue down the spur. The gunners could not discriminate friend from foe and killed many New Army troops who were amongst the charging Ottomans, as the Leinsters were rushed up to the Apex to reinforce. At the north side of Rhododendron Spur, the Ottomans descended from Chunuk Bair to the small plateau of the Farm and overran Baldwin&#x27;s brigade, the Warwicks being almost annihilated, the 6th Royal Irish Rifles losing half its number and Baldwin being killed; the survivors retreating to Cheshire Ridge. The Turkish infantry were exhausted and fell back to the main ridge and the Farm plateau became part of no man&#x27;s land.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The loss of Chunuk Bair marked the end of the Battle of Sari Bair. Fighting would continue elsewhere until August 29 but there would be no more attempts to capture the heights. The Apex formed the new front line on Rhododendron Spur. In 1919 burial teams found the Farm still covered in the bones of the men from Baldwin&#x27;s brigade; their remains were interred in The Farm Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery when it was constructed on the site after the Armistice.

===Casualties===

Charles Bean, the Australian official historian, wrote that the Ottomans had in four days at Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, from the 19th Division sector around and the top of Monash Valley and in the 16th Division, mainly at Lone Pine.

A memorial arch, the Malone Memorial Gate, commemorating Lieutenant-Colonel Malone was constructed in Stratford, New Zealand in 1923 and a plaque unveiled in the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s Grand Hall in 2005. A memorial to honour New Zealand soldiers who died in the campaign was unveiled on Chunuk Bair in May 1925. 
===Victoria Cross===
One Victoria Cross was awarded for actions at Chunuk Bair to Corporal Cyril Bassett, who repaired phone lines while under fire.

==Appearances in popular culture==

New Zealand writer Maurice Shadbolt produced a play &quot;Once on Chunuk Bair&quot; in 1982. A film version &quot;Chunuk Bair&quot; (Daybreak Pictures) was released in 1991.
There is a detailed fictional description of the battle from the point of view of an Ottoman Turkish soldier in &quot;Birds Without Wings&quot; by Louis de Bernieres, author of &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;. &quot;Once on Chunuk Bair&quot; was performed on the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Chunuk Bair in Christchurch, New Zealand. It was directed by Martin Howells. (see https://ww100.govt.nz/performance-of-&#x27;once-on-chunuk-bair&#x27;-christchurch )

Composer Dwayne Bloomfield was in 2001 inspired by this battle to write the original work for brass band &quot;Behold the Narrows from the Hill&quot; describing the battle. This was the first of several brass band works he has composed commemorating the contributions of New Zealand and Australian forces to particular First World War battles.

Musician PJ Harvey sings about the aftermath of this battle in the song &quot;On Battleship Hill&quot; from her 2011 album Let England Shake.

The Battle of Chunuk Bair was featured in the Gallipoli miniseries in 2015.

<text>Straight pool, which is also called 14.1 continuous and 14.1 rack, is a cue sport in which two competing players attempt to as many s as possible without playing a . The game was the primary version of pool played in professional competition until it was superseded by faster-playing games like nine-ball and eight-ball in the 1980s.

In straight pool, the player may and attempt to pocket any object ball on the table regardless of its number or color until only one object ball and the remain, at which point the other fourteen balls are re-racked. At this point, play resumes with the objective of pocketing the remaining ball in a manner that causes the cue ball to into the rack, spreading out the balls and allowing the player to continue the . The goal is to reach a set number of points that is determined by agreement before the game begins; traditionally 100 points is needed for a win, though professional matches may go higher. One point is scored by pocketing an object ball without a foul, while a point is deducted on a foul.

The game was most popular in the United States and was notably played in the 1961 film &quot;The Hustler&quot;. The World Straight Pool Championship was held from 1911 until 1990, and again from 2006 until 2019. The game is currently represented at a continental level in events such as the International Straight Pool Open and the European Pool Championships&#x27; straight pool event.

==History==

Straight pool is derived from an earlier game called continuous pool, in which points are earned for every ball that is pocketed. In this game, the last is pocketed (not left on the table as in straight pool), and then racked with the rest of them when a new game begins (the player who pocketed the final ball plays the break shot in the new game). As players became skilled in scoring dozens of points in a single turn, they would often use defensive shots on the break to avoid their opponent pocketing the 15 balls on the table. Continuous pool was invented in 1889 and played professionally until 1911.

In 1910, Jerome Keogh, who won numerous continuous pool tournaments, wanted to increase the attacking nature from the break-off shot, and make it more plausible to perform multi-rack s. He introduced the modern rule that the object balls are re-racked not when all have been pocketed but after 14 have been sunk and one remains on the table. This new game became known as &quot;14.1 continuous&quot; and &quot;14.1 rack&quot;, and in 1912 it became known as straight pool. The first 14.1 professional championship was held in 1912 in Philadelphia. The game quickly overtook continuous pool in popularity and was the most-played version of pool until nine-ball and eight-ball became popular.

==Gameplay==
In straight pool&#x27;s first , the fifteen object balls are racked with the center of the apex ball placed over the . Traditionally the is placed at the rack&#x27;s right corner and the is placed at the rack&#x27;s left corner for visibility, though there is no such rule requirement. Other balls are placed at random and must touch adjacent balls.

Unlike most pool games, the object of straight pool&#x27;s typical break shot (with all 15 object balls racked together) is to leave the opponent without the chance to pot a ball. All shots–including the break shot–in straight pool require , in which both a ball and pocket are before the shot is taken. Consequently, in the first break shot the racked balls are usually not struck with force in hopes of pocketing a ball (the odds of pocketing the called one are very low), but just hard enough to drive at least one ball to a to avoid a foul, and ideally off the cushion and gently back into the of balls. This is a form . Some shots, such as s and s, do not have to be called. On the break, either the cue ball and two other balls must touch a rail, or a ball must be pocketed. The failure to accomplish either of these conditions results in a foul. Fouling on the initial break incurs a penalty loss of two points. In addition, the opponent has the choice of either accepting the table in position or of having the balls ed and requiring the offending player to repeat the opening break. All other fouls made during the game incur a one-point deduction, and a player incurs an additional 15-point penalty for committing three consecutive fouls.
The unique feature of straight pool is the racking that is played when one object ball remains. These intra-game racks have a specific set of rules; when the rack is supposed to be replaced, if neither the cue ball nor the object ball remain in the rack area, the balls are replaced with no ball at the apex. At this point, the aim is to pot the remaining ball and carom into the pack of balls, allowing a shot on the next ball to continue the run. Additional rules apply when either ball is in the position where the balls would usually be racked.

==Highest runs==
In straight pool, skilled players can pot all of the balls in a single rack and continue to do so for large runs. On March 19, 1954, Willie Mosconi set a record-high run of 526 points over 36 racks. Mosconi had been playing a -to-200-points match against an amateur player name Earl Bruney in Springfield, Ohio. Bruney scored the first three points in the match, but Mosconi ran the next 200 points to win. However, Mosconi continued the run for over two hours to score 526 before missing a fine . The run was witnessed by 300 people, including a lawyer who produced an affidavit to confirm it took place, and it was later confirmed by the Billiard Congress of America.

Mosconi&#x27;s record for the highest documented run stood for over 65 years. It was finally beaten on May 27, 2019, when John Schmidt ran 626 balls in Monterey, California, which was the result of a sustained, months-long effort to break Mosconi&#x27;s record. Critics have argued that Mosconi&#x27;s record was made in competition while Schmidt simply set up break shots for himself, and that his video was never released. In a similar format as Schmidt&#x27;s run, on January 18th 2022, as part of the &quot;Legends of Pocket Billiards&quot; high run series, where a number of player have attempted to beat the record, Jayson Shaw completed a record-breaking run of 669 balls. On January 6th 2025, this record was broken by Jayson Shaw again, with a new high-run of 832 balls.

==Tournaments and governance==
Straight pool is governed by regional councils such as the European Pocket Billiard Federation, and at a worldwide level by the World Pool-Billiard Association. The World Straight Pool Championship was created in 1912 and ran sporadically until 1990. In 2006, the championship was revived, until again ending in 2010. A straight pool event has been played at the European Pool Championships annually since 1980. The U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship was sanctioned by the Billiard Congress of America (BCA) from 1966 to 2000; It was revived by CueSports International (CSI) for one year in 2007 and afterwards was held annually from 2016, until again ending in 2019.

The game has been in decline since the 1980s; players in the United States have often called straight pool &quot;dead&quot;. Popularity of the game has been reduced due to the popularity of other pool games such as nine-ball and eight-ball, and a lack of straight pool competitions.

==In popular culture==
Straight pool has been featured in popular culture, most notably in the 1959 novel &quot;The Hustler&quot; and its 1961 film adaptation. It also provides the setting and background for John O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s monologue short story &quot;Straight Pool&quot;.

Straight pool, in common with other pool games, has been associated with hustling. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; produced an episode titled &quot;A Game of Pool&quot; in 1961, and remade it in 1989, with a straight-pool player being revived from the afterlife to compete in one last match.

<text>The Symphony No. 36 in C major, K. 425, also known as the Linz Symphony, was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart during a stopover in the Austrian town of Linz on his and his wife&#x27;s way back home to Vienna from Salzburg in late 1783. The entire symphony was written in four days to accommodate the local count&#x27;s announcement, upon hearing of the Mozarts&#x27; arrival in Linz, of a concert. The première in Linz took place on 4 November 1783. The composition was also premièred in Vienna on 1 April 1784. The autograph score of the &quot;Linz Symphony&quot; was not preserved, but a set of parts sold by Mozart to the Fürstenberg court at Donaueschingen in 1786 does survive.

== Structure ==

There are 4 movements:

#Adagio, – Allegro spiritoso, 
#Un Poco Adagio in F major, 
#Menuetto, 
#Finale (Presto), 

Every movement except the minuet is in sonata form.

The first movement briefly quotes the famous Hallelujah Chorus from Handel&#x27;s Messiah in the exposition.

The slow movement has a siciliano character and meter which was rare in Mozart&#x27;s earlier symphonies (only used in one of the slow movements of the &quot;Paris&quot;) but would appear frequently in later works such as No. 38 and No. 40.

The next symphony by Mozart is Symphony No. 38. The work known as &quot;Symphony No. 37&quot; is mostly by Michael Haydn.

<text>Coretta Scott King ( Scott; April 27, 1927 – January 30, 2006) was an American author, activist, and civil rights leader who was the wife of Martin Luther King Jr. from 1953 until his assassination in 1968. As an advocate for African-American equality, she was a leader for the civil rights movement in the 1960s. King was also a singer who often incorporated music into her civil rights work. King met her husband while attending graduate school in Boston. They both became increasingly active in the American civil rights movement.

King played a prominent role in the years after her husband&#x27;s assassination in 1968, when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the Women&#x27;s Movement. King founded the King Center, and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. She finally succeeded when Ronald Reagan signed legislation which established Martin Luther King, Jr., Day on November 2, 1983. She later broadened her scope to include both advocacy for LGBTQ rights and opposition to apartheid. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin&#x27;s death, including John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Robert F. Kennedy. Her telephone conversation with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election has been credited by historians for mobilizing African-American voters.

In August 2005, King suffered a stroke which paralyzed her right side and left her unable to speak; five months later, she died of respiratory failure due to complications from ovarian cancer. Her funeral was attended by some 10,000 people, including U.S. presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. She was temporarily buried on the grounds of the King Center until being interred next to her husband. She was inducted into the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and was the first African American to lie in state at the Georgia State Capitol. King has been referred to as &quot;First Lady of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;.

== Childhood and education ==
Coretta Scott was born in Heiberger, Alabama, the third of four children of Obadiah Scott (1899–1998) and Bernice McMurry Scott (1904–1996). She was born in her parents&#x27; home, with her paternal great-grandmother Delia Scott, a former slave, presiding as midwife. Coretta&#x27;s mother became known for her musical talent and singing voice. As a child, Bernice attended the local Crossroads School; her formal education ended with the fourth grade. Bernice&#x27;s older siblings, however, boarded at the Tuskegee Institute, founded by Booker T. Washington. The senior Mrs. Scott worked as a school bus driver, as a church pianist, and for her husband in his business. She served as Worthy Matron for her Prince Hall Order of the Eastern Star chapter, and was a member of the local Literacy Federated Club.

Obie, Coretta&#x27;s father, was one of the first black people in their town to own a vehicle. Before starting his own businesses, he worked as a policeman. Along with his wife, he ran a clothing shop far from their home and later opened a general store. He also owned a lumber mill, which was burned down by white neighbors after Scott refused to sell his mill to a white logger. Her maternal grandparents were Mollie (née Smith; 1868 – d.) and Martin van Buren McMurry (1863–1950) – both were of African-American and Irish descent. Mollie was born a slave to plantation owners Jim Blackburn and Adeline (Blackburn) Smith. Coretta&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Martin, was born to a slave of Black Native American ancestry, and her white master who never acknowledged Martin as his son. He eventually owned a 280-acre farm. Because of his diverse origins, Martin appeared to be white. However, he displayed contempt for the notion of passing. As a self-taught reader with little formal education, he is noted for having inspired Coretta&#x27;s passion for education. Coretta&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Cora (née McLaughlin; 1876 – 1920) and Jefferson F. Scott (1873–1941). Cora died before Coretta&#x27;s birth. Jeff Scott was a farmer and a prominent figure in the rural black religious community; he was born to former slaves Willis and Delia Scott.

At age 10, Coretta worked to increase the family&#x27;s income. She had an older sister named Edythe Scott Bagley (1924–2011), an older sister named Eunice who did not survive childhood, and a younger brother named Obadiah Leonard (1930–2012). The Scott family had owned a farm since the American Civil War, but were not particularly wealthy. During the Great Depression the Scott children picked cotton to help earn money and shared a bedroom with their parents.

Coretta described herself as a tomboy during her childhood, primarily because she could climb trees and recalled wrestling boys. She also mentioned having been stronger than a male cousin and threatening before accidentally cutting that same cousin with an axe. His mother threatened her, and along with the words of her siblings, stirred her to becoming more ladylike once she got older. She saw irony in the fact that despite these early physical activities, she still was involved in nonviolent movements. Her brother Obadiah thought she always &quot;tried to excel in everything she did.&quot; Her sister Edythe believed her personality was like that of their grandmother Cora McLaughlin Scott, after whom she was named. Though lacking formal education themselves, Coretta Scott&#x27;s parents intended for all of their children to be educated. Coretta quoted her mother as having said, &quot;My children are going to college, even if it means I only have but one dress to put on.&quot;

The Scott children attended a one-room elementary school from their home and were later bused to Lincoln Normal School, which despite being from their home, was the closest black high school in Marion, Alabama, due to racial segregation in schools. The bus was driven by Coretta&#x27;s mother Bernice, who bused all the local black teenagers. By the time Scott had entered the school, Lincoln had suspended tuition and charged only four dollars and fifty cents per year. In her last two years there, Scott became the leading soprano for the school&#x27;s senior chorus. Scott directed a choir at her home church in North Perry Country. Coretta Scott graduated valedictorian from Lincoln Normal School in 1945, where she played trumpet and piano, sang in the chorus, and participated in school musicals and enrolled at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio during her senior year at Lincoln. After being accepted to Antioch, she applied for the Interracial Scholarship Fund for financial aid. During her last two years in high school, Coretta lived with her parents. Her older sister Edythe already attended Antioch as part of the Antioch Program for Interracial Education, which recruited non-white students and gave them full scholarships in an attempt to diversify the historically white campus. Coretta said of her first college:

Coretta studied music with Walter Anderson, the first non-white chair of an academic department in a historically white college. She also became politically active, due largely to her experience of racial discrimination by the local school board. She became active in the nascent civil rights movement; she joined the Antioch chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the college&#x27;s Race Relations and Civil Liberties Committees. The board denied her request to perform her second year of required practice teaching at Yellow Springs public schools, for her teaching certificate Coretta Scott appealed to the Antioch College administration, which was unwilling or unable to change the situation in the local school system and instead employed her at the college&#x27;s associated laboratory school for a second year. Additionally, around this time, Coretta worked as a babysitter for the Lithgow family, babysitting the later prominent actor John Lithgow.

== New England Conservatory of Music and Martin Luther King Jr. ==

Coretta transferred out of Antioch when she won a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. It was while studying singing at that school with Marie Sundelius that she met Martin Luther King Jr. after mutual friend Mary Powell gave King her phone number after he asked about girls on the campus. Coretta was the only one remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King would tell her that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met. She told him &quot;I don&#x27;t see how you can say that. You don&#x27;t even know me.&quot; But King was assured and asked to see her again. She readily accepted his invitation to a weekend party.

She continued to see him regularly in the early months of 1952. Two weeks after meeting Scott, King wrote to his mother that he had met his wife. Their dates usually consisted of political and racial discussions, and in August of that year Coretta met King&#x27;s parents Martin Luther King Sr. and Alberta Williams King. Before meeting Martin, Coretta had been in relationships her entire time in school but never had any she cared to develop. Once meeting with her sister Edythe face-to-face, Coretta detailed her feelings for the young aspiring minister and discussed the relationship as well. Edythe was able to tell her sister had legitimate feelings for him, and she also became impressed with his overall demeanor.

Despite envisioning a career for herself in the music industry, Coretta knew that it would not be possible if she were to marry King. However, since King possessed many of the qualities she liked in a man, she found herself &quot;becoming more involved with every passing moment.&quot; When asked by her sister what made King so &quot;appealing&quot; to her she responded, &quot;I suppose it&#x27;s because Martin reminds me so much of our father.&quot; At that moment, Scott&#x27;s sister knew King was &quot;the one&quot;.

King&#x27;s parents visited him in the fall and had suspicions about Coretta Scott after seeing how clean his apartment was. While the Kings had tea and meals with their son and Scott, Martin Sr. turned his attention to her and insinuated that her plans of a career in music were not fitting for a Baptist minister&#x27;s wife. After Coretta did not respond to his questioning of their romance being serious, Martin Sr. asked if she took his son &quot;seriously&quot;. King&#x27;s father also told her that there were many other women his son was interested in and had &quot;a lot to offer&quot;. After telling him that she had &quot;a lot to offer&quot; as well, Martin Luther King Sr. and his wife went on to try and meet with members of Coretta&#x27;s family. Once the two obtained Edythe&#x27;s number from Coretta, they sat down with her and had lunch with her. During their time together, Martin Luther King Sr. tried to ask Edythe about the relationship between her sister and his son. Edythe insisted that her sister was an excellent choice for Martin Luther King Jr., but also felt that Coretta did not need to bargain for a husband.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1953, the couple announced their plans to marry in the &quot;Atlanta Daily World&quot;. With a wedding set in June, only four months away at that time, Coretta still did not have a commitment to marrying King and consulted with her sister in a letter sent just before Easter Vacation. King&#x27;s father had expressed resentment in his choice of Coretta over someone from Alabama and accused his son of spending too much time with her and neglecting his studies. Martin took his mother into another room and told her of his plans to marry Coretta and told her the same thing when he drove her home later while also berating her for not having made a good impression on his father. When Martin declared his intentions to get a doctorate and marry Coretta after, Martin Sr. finally gave his blessing. In 1964, the &quot;Time&quot; profile of Martin, when he was chosen as &quot;Time&quot; &quot;Man of the Year&quot;, referred to her as &quot;a talented young soprano&quot;. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha.

Coretta Scott and Martin Luther King Jr. were married on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her mother&#x27;s house; the ceremony was performed by Martin Sr. Coretta had the vow to obey her husband removed from the ceremony, which was unusual for the time. After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to Montgomery, Alabama, in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: &quot;After we married, we moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where my husband had accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before long, we found ourselves in the middle of the Montgomery bus boycott, and Martin was elected leader of the protest movement. As the boycott continued, I had a growing sense that I was involved in something so much greater than myself, something of profound historic importance. I came to the realization that we had been thrust into the forefront of a movement to liberate oppressed people, not only in Montgomery but also throughout our country, and this movement had worldwide implications. I felt blessed to have been called to be a part of such a noble and historic cause.&quot;

== Civil Rights Movement ==

On September 1, 1954, Martin became the full-time pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. King&#x27;s devotion to the cause while giving up on her own musical ambitions would become symbolic of the actions of African-American women during the movement. The couple moved into the church&#x27;s parsonage on South Jackson Street shortly after this. Coretta became a member of the choir and taught Sunday school, as well as participating in the Baptist Training Union and Missionary Society. She made her first appearance at the First Baptist Church on March 6, 1955, where according to E. P. Wallace, she &quot;captivated her concert audience&quot;.

The Kings&#x27; first child was born on November 17, 1955, and was named Yolanda at Coretta&#x27;s insistence. After Martin Luther King became involved in the Montgomery bus boycott, Mrs. King often received threats directed towards him. In January 1956, she answered numerous phone calls threatening her husband&#x27;s life, as rumors intended to make African Americans dissatisfied with Martin Luther King spread that he had purchased a Buick station wagon for her. Martin would give her the nickname &quot;Yoki&quot;, and thereby, allow himself to refer to her out of her name. By the end of the boycott, the Kings had come to believe in nonviolent protests as a way of expression consistent with biblical teachings. Two days after the integration of Montgomery&#x27;s bus service, on December 23, a gunshot rang through the front door of the King home while the King family were asleep. The three were not harmed. On Christmas Eve of 1955, King took her daughter to her parents&#x27; house and met with her siblings as well. Yolanda was their first grandchild. Martin joined them the next day, at dinner time.

On February 21, 1956, Martin Luther King said he would return to Montgomery after picking up Coretta and their daughter from Atlanta, who were staying with his parents. During Martin Sr.&#x27;s opposition to his son&#x27;s choice to return to Montgomery, Mrs. King picked up her daughter and went upstairs, which he would express dismay in later and tell her that she &quot;had run out on him&quot;. Two days later, Coretta and Martin Luther King drove back to Montgomery. Coretta took an active role in advocating for civil rights legislation. On April 25, 1958, King made her first appearance at a concert that year at Peter High School Auditorium in Birmingham, Alabama. With a performance sponsored by the Omicron Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, King changed a few songs in the first part of the show but still continued with the basic format used two years earlier at the New York gala as she told the story of the Montgomery bus boycott. The concert was important for Coretta as a way to continue her professional career and participate in the movement. The concert gave the audience &quot;an emotional connection to the messages of social, economic, and spiritual transformation.&quot;

On September 3, 1958, King accompanied her husband and Ralph Abernathy to a courtroom. Martin was arrested outside the courtroom for &quot;loitering&quot; and &quot;failing to obey an officer&quot;. A few weeks later, King visited Martin&#x27;s parents in Atlanta. At that time, she learned that he had been stabbed while signing copies of his book &quot;Stride Toward Freedom&quot; on September 20, 1958. King rushed to see her husband, and stayed with him for the remainder of his time in the hospital recovering. On February 3, 1959, Mr. and Mrs. King and Lawrence D. Reddick started a five-week tour of India. The three were invited to hundreds of engagements. During their trip, Coretta used her singing ability to enthuse crowds during their month-long stay. The two returned to the United States on March 10, 1959.

===House bombing===
On January 30, 1956, Coretta and Dexter congregation member Roscoe Williams&#x27; wife Mary Lucy heard the &quot;sound of a brick striking the concrete floor of the front porch.&quot; Coretta suggested that the two women get out of the front room and went into the guest room, as the house was disturbed by an explosion which caused the house to rock and fill the front room with smoke and shattered glass. The two went to the rear of the home, where Yolanda was sleeping and Coretta called the First Baptist Church and reported the bombing to the woman who answered the phone. Martin returned to their home, and upon finding Coretta and his daughter unharmed, went outside. He was confronted by an angry crowd of his supporters, who had brought guns. He was able to turn them away with an impromptu speech.

A white man was reported by a lone witness to have walked halfway up to King&#x27;s door and thrown something against the door before running back to his car and speeding off. Ernest Walters, the lone witness, did not manage to get the license plate number because of how quickly the events transpired. Both of the couple&#x27;s fathers contacted them over the bombing. The two arrived nearly at the same time, along with her Martin Luther King&#x27;s mother and brother. Coretta&#x27;s father Obie said he would take her and her daughter back to Marion if his son-in-law did not take them to Atlanta. Coretta refused the proclamation and insisted on staying with her husband. Despite Martin Sr. also advocating that she leave with her father, King persisted in leaving with him. Author Octavia B. Vivian wrote &quot;That night Coretta lost her fear of dying. She committed herself more deeply to the freedom struggle, as Martin had done four days previously when jailed for the first time in his life.&quot; Coretta would later call it the first time she realized &quot;how much I meant to Martin in terms of supporting him in what he was doing&quot;.

===John F. Kennedy phone call===
Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed on October 19, 1960, in a department store. After being released three days later, he was sent back to jail on October 22 for driving with an Alabama license while being a resident of Georgia and was sent to jail for four months of hard labor. After his arrest, Mrs. King believed he would not make it out alive and telephoned her friend Harris Wofford and cried while saying &quot;They&#x27;re going to kill him. I know they are going to kill him.&quot; Directly after speaking with her, Wofford contacted Sargent Shriver in Chicago, where presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, was campaigning at the time and told Shriver of King&#x27;s fears for her husband. After Shriver waited to be with Kennedy alone, he suggested that he telephone King and express sympathy. Kennedy called King, after agreeing to the proposal.

Sometime afterward, Robert F. Kennedy obtained King&#x27;s release from prison. Martin Sr. was so grateful for the release that he voted for Kennedy and said: &quot;I&#x27;ll take a Catholic or the devil himself if he&#x27;ll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law&#x27;s eyes.&quot; According to Coretta, Kennedy said &quot;I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I just want you to know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me.&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it &quot;made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt.&quot;

===Kennedy presidency===
Mr. and Mrs. King had come to respect President Kennedy and understood his reluctance at times to get involved openly with civil rights. In April 1962, Coretta served as a delegate for the Women Strike for Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Martin drove her to the hospital on March 28, 1963, where King gave birth to their fourth child Bernice. After King and her daughter were due to come home, Martin rushed back to drive them himself.
After Martin Luther King&#x27;s arrest on April 12, 1963, King tried to make direct contact with President Kennedy at the advisement of Wyatt Tee Walker and succeeded in speaking with Robert F. Kennedy. President Kennedy was with his father Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr, who was not feeling well. In what has been noted as making Kennedy seem less sympathetic towards the Kings, the president redirected Mrs. King&#x27;s call to the White House switchboard.

The next day, President Kennedy reported to King that the FBI had been sent into Birmingham the previous night and confirmed that her husband was fine. He was allowed to speak with her on the phone and told her to inform Walker of Kennedy&#x27;s involvement. She told her husband of her assistance from the Kennedys, which her husband took as the reason &quot;why everybody is suddenly being so polite.&quot; Regarding the March on Washington, Coretta said, &quot;It was as though heaven had come down.&quot; Coretta had been home all day with their children, since the birth of their daughter Bernice had not allowed her to attend Easter Sunday church services. Since Mrs. King had issued her own statement regarding the aid of the president instead of doing as her husband had told her and report to Wyatt Walker, this according to author Taylor Branch, made her portrayed by reports as &quot;an anxious new mother who may have confused her White House fantasies with reality.&quot;

Coretta went to a Women Strike for Peace rally in New York, in the early days of November 1963. After speaking at the meeting held in the National Baptist Church, King joined the march from Central Park to the United Nations Headquarters. The march was timed to celebrate the group&#x27;s second anniversary and celebrated the successful completion of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Coretta and Martin learned of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination when reports initially indicated he had only been seriously wounded. Coretta joined her husband upstairs and watched Walter Cronkite announce the president&#x27;s death. King sat with her visibly shaken husband following the confirmation.

===FBI tapes===

The FBI planned to mail tapes of her husband&#x27;s alleged affairs to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference office since surveillance revealed that Coretta opened her husband&#x27;s mail when he was traveling. The FBI learned that Martin Luther King would be out of office by the time the tapes were mailed and that his wife would be the one to open it. J. Edgar Hoover even advised to mail &quot;it from a southern state.&quot; Coretta sorted the tapes with the rest of the mail, listened to them, and immediately called her husband, &quot;giving the Bureau a great deal of pleasure with the tone and tenor of her reactions.&quot; Martin Luther King played the tape in her presence, along with Andrew Young, Ralph Abernathy and Joseph Lowery. Publicly, Mrs. King would say &quot;I couldn&#x27;t make much out of it, it was just a lot of mumbo-jumbo.&quot; The tapes were part of a larger attempt by J. Edgar Hoover to denounce King by revelations about his personal life.

=== Johnson presidency ===
Most prominently, perhaps, she worked hard to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. King spoke with Malcolm X days before his assassination. Malcolm told her that he was not in Alabama to make trouble for her husband, but instead to make white people have more appreciation for King&#x27;s protests, seeing his alternative. On March 26, 1965, King&#x27;s father joined her and her husband for a march that would later end in Montgomery. Her father &quot;caught a glimpse of America&#x27;s true potential&quot; and for the called it &quot;the greatest day in the whole history of America&quot; after seeing chanting for his daughter&#x27;s husband by both Caucasians and African Americans.

Coretta Scott King criticized the sexism of the Civil Rights Movement in January 1966 in &quot;New Lady&quot; magazine, saying in part, &quot;Not enough attention has been focused on the roles played by women in the struggle. By and large, men have formed the leadership in the civil rights struggle but ... women have been the backbone of the whole civil rights movement.&quot; Martin Luther King Jr. himself limited Coretta&#x27;s role in the movement, and expected her to be a housewife. King participated in a Women Strike for Peace protest in January 1968, at the capital of Washington, D.C., with over five thousand women. In honor of the first woman elected to the House of Representatives, the group was called the Jeannette Rankin Brigade. Coretta co-chaired the Congress of Women conference with Pearl Willen and Mary Clarke. At some point in his activities, Martin suggested that the people working with him should organize a &quot;sex party&quot;.

== Assassination of her husband ==
Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968. She learned of the shooting after being called by Jesse Jackson when she returned from shopping with her eldest child Yolanda. King had difficulty settling her children with the news that their father was deceased. She received a large number of telegrams, including one from Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s mother, which she regarded as the one that touched her the most.

In an effort to prepare her daughter Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she tried to explain to her that the next time she saw her father he would be in a casket and would not be speaking. When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and told him that his father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert F. Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis. Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination and asked if he could persuade Jacqueline Kennedy to attend her husband&#x27;s funeral with him.

Robert F. Kennedy promised her that he would help &quot;any way&quot; he could. King was told to not go ahead and agree to Kennedy&#x27;s offer by Southern Christian Leadership Conference members, who told her about his presidential ambitions. She ignored the warnings and went along with his request. On April 5, 1968, King arrived in Memphis to retrieve her husband&#x27;s body and decided that the casket should be kept open during the funeral with the hope that her children would realize upon seeing his body that he would not be coming home. King called photographer Bob Fitch and asked for documentation to be done, having known him for years. On April 7, 1968, former Vice President Richard Nixon visited King and recalled his first meeting with her husband in 1955. Nixon also went to Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x27;s funeral on April 9, 1968, but did not walk in the procession. Nixon believed participating in the procession would be &quot;grandstanding&quot;.

On April 8, 1968, King and her children headed a march with sanitation workers that her husband had planned to carry out before his death. After the marchers reached the staging area at the Civic Center Plaza in front of Memphis City Hall, onlookers proceeded to take pictures of King and her children but stopped when she addressed everyone at a microphone. She said that despite the Martin Luther King Jr. being away from his children at times, &quot;his children knew that Daddy loved them, and the time that he spent with them was well spent.&quot; Prior to Martin&#x27;s funeral, Jacqueline Kennedy met with her. The two spent five minutes together and despite the short visit, Coretta called it comforting. King&#x27;s parents arrived from Alabama. Robert and Ethel Kennedy came, the latter being embraced by King. King and her sister-in-law Christine King Farris tried to prepare the children for seeing Martin&#x27;s body. With the end of the funeral service, King led her children and mourners in a march from the church to Morehouse College, her late husband&#x27;s alma mater.

=== Early widowhood ===
Two days after her husband&#x27;s death, King spoke at Ebenezer Baptist Church and made her first statement on his views since he had died. She said her husband told their children, &quot;If a man had nothing that was worth dying for, then he was not fit to live.&quot; She brought up his ideals and the fact that he may be dead, but concluded that &quot;his spirit will never die.&quot; Not very long after the assassination, Coretta took his place at a peace rally in New York City. Using notes he had written before his death, King constructed her own speech. Coretta approached the African-American entertainer and activist Josephine Baker to take her husband&#x27;s place in the Civil Rights Movement. Baker declined after thinking it over, stating that her twelve adopted children (known as the &quot;rainbow tribe&quot;) were &quot;too young to lose their mother&quot;.

Coretta Scott King eventually broadened her focus to include women&#x27;s rights, LGBT rights, economic issues, world peace, and various other causes. As early as December 1968, she called for women to &quot;unite and form a solid block of women power to fight the three great evils of racism, poverty and war&quot;, during a Solidarity Day speech. On April 27, 1968, King spoke at an anti-war demonstration in Central Park in place of her husband. King made it clear that there was no reason &quot;why a nation as rich as ours should be blighted by poverty, disease, and illiteracy.&quot; King used notes taken from her husband&#x27;s pockets upon his death, which included the &quot;Ten Commandments on Vietnam&quot;. On June 5, 1968, Bobby Kennedy was shot after winning the California primary for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. After he died the following day, Ethel Kennedy, who King had spoken to with her husband only two months earlier, was widowed. King flew to Los Angeles to comfort Ethel over Bobby&#x27;s death. On June 8, 1968, while King was attending the late senator&#x27;s funeral, the Justice Department made the announcement of James Earl Ray&#x27;s arrest.

Not long after this, the King household was visited by Mike Wallace, who wanted to visit her and the rest of her family and see how they were faring that coming Christmas. She introduced her family to Wallace and also expressed her belief that there would not be another Martin Luther King Jr. because he comes around &quot;once in a century&quot; or &quot;maybe once in a thousand years&quot;. She furthered that she believed her children needed her more than ever and that there was hope for redemption in her husband&#x27;s death. In January 1969, King and Bernita Bennette left for a trip to India. Before arriving in the country, the two stopped in Verona, Italy, where King was awarded the Universal Love Award. King became the first non-Italian to receive the award. King traveled to London with her sister, sister-in-law, Bennette and several others to preach at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Before, no woman had ever delivered a sermon at a regularly appointed service in the cathedral.

As a leader of the movement, King founded the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. She served as the center&#x27;s president and CEO from its inception until she passed the reins of leadership to son Dexter Scott King. Removing herself from leadership, allowed her to focus on writing, public speaking and spend time with her parents.

She published her memoirs, &quot;My Life with Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot;, in 1969. President Richard Nixon was advised against visiting her on the first anniversary of his death since it would &quot;outrage&quot; many people. On October 15, 1969, King was the lead speaker at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam demonstration in Washington, D.C., where she led a crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House bearing candles. At a subsequent speech, she denounced the War in Vietnam.

Coretta was also under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1968 until 1972. Her husband&#x27;s activities had been monitored during his lifetime. Documents obtained by a Houston television station show that the FBI worried that Coretta would &quot;tie the anti-Vietnam movement to the civil rights movement.&quot; The FBI studied her memoir and concluded that her &quot;selfless, magnanimous, decorous attitude is belied by ... [her] actual shrewd, calculating, businesslike activities.&quot; A spokesman for the King family said that they were aware of the surveillance, but had not realized how extensive it was.

== Later life ==

Every year after the assassination of her husband in 1968, Coretta attended a commemorative service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta to mark his birthday on January 15. She fought for years to make it a national holiday. In 1972, she said that there should be at least one national holiday a year in tribute to an African-American man, &quot;and, at this point, Martin is the best candidate we have.&quot; Murray M. Silver, an Atlanta attorney, made the appeal at the services on January 14, 1979. Coretta Scott King later confirmed that it was the &quot;best, most productive appeal ever&quot;. Coretta Scott King was finally successful in this campaign in 1986, when Martin Luther King Jr. Day was made a federal holiday.

After the death of J. Edgar Hoover, King made no attempt to hide her bitterness towards him for his work against her husband in a long statement. Coretta Scott King attended the state funeral of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973, as a very close friend of the former president. On July 25, 1978, King held a press conference in defense of then-Ambassador Andrew Young and his controversial statement on political prisoners in American jails.
On September 19, 1979, King visited the Lyndon B. Johnson ranch to meet with Lady Bird Johnson.
In 1979 and 1980 Dr. Noel Erskine and King co-taught a class on &quot;The Theology of Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; at the Candler School of Theology (Emory University). On September 29, 1980, King&#x27;s signing as a commentator for CNN was announced by Ted Turner.

On August 26, 1983, King resented endorsing Jesse Jackson for president, since she wanted to back up someone she believed could beat Ronald Reagan, and dismissed her husband becoming a presidential candidate had he lived. On June 26, 1985, King was arrested with her daughter Bernice and son Martin Luther King III while taking part in an anti-apartheid protest at the Embassy of South Africa in Washington, D.C.

When President Ronald Reagan signed legislation establishing the Martin Luther King Jr. Day, she was at the event. Reagan called her to personally apologize for a remark he made during a nationally televised conference, where he said we would know in &quot;35 years&quot; whether or not King was a communist sympathizer. Reagan clarified his remarks came from the fact that the papers had been sealed off until the year 2027. King accepted the apology and pointed out the Senate Select Committee on Assassinations had not found any basis to suggest her husband had communist ties. On February 9, 1987, eight civil rights activists were jailed for protesting the exclusion of African Americans during the filming of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in Cumming, Georgia. Oprah Winfrey tried to find out why the &quot;community has not allowed black people to live there since 1912.&quot; King was outraged over the arrests, and wanted members of the group, &quot;Coalition to End Fear and Intimidation in Forsyth County&quot;, to meet with Georgia Governor Joe Frank Harris to &quot;seek a just resolution of the situation.&quot; On March 8, 1989, King lectured hundreds of students about the civil rights movement at the University of San Diego. King tried to not get involved in the controversy around the naming of the San Diego Convention Center after her husband. She maintained it was up to the &quot;people within the community&quot; and that people had tried to get her involved in with &quot;those kind of local situations.&quot;

On January 17, 1993, King showed disdain for the U.S. missile attack on Iraq. In retaliation, she suggested peace protests. On February 16, 1993, King went to the FBI Headquarters and gave an approving address on Director William S. Sessions for having the FBI &quot;turn its back on the abuses of the Hoover era.&quot; King commended Sessions for his &quot;leadership in bringing women and minorities into the FBI and for being a true friend of civil rights.&quot; King admitted that she would not have accepted the arrangement had it not been for Sessions, the then-current director. On January 17, 1994, the day marking the 65th birthday of her husband, King said: &quot;No injustice, no matter how great, can excuse even a single act of violence against another human being.&quot; In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz was indicted on charges of using telephones and crossing state lines in a plot to kill Louis Farrakhan. King defended her, saying at Riverside Church in Harlem that federal prosecutors targeted her to tarnish her father Malcolm X&#x27;s legacy. During the fall of 1995, King chaired an attempt to register one million African American female voters for the presidential election next year with fellow widows Betty Shabazz and Myrlie Evers and was saluted by her daughter Yolanda in a Washington hotel ballroom. On October 12, 1995, King spoke about the O. J. Simpson murder case, which she negated having a long-term effect on relations between races when speaking to an audience at Soka University in Aliso Viejo, California.
On January 24, 1996, King delivered a 40-minute speech at the Loyola University&#x27;s Lake Shore campus in Rogers Park. She called for everyone to &quot;pick up the torch of freedom and lead America towards another great revolution.&quot; On June 1, 1997, Betty Shabazz suffered extensive and life-threatening burns after her grandson Malcolm Shabazz started a fire in their home. In response to the hospitalization of her longtime friend, King donated $5,000 to a rehabilitation fund for her. Shabazz died on June 23, 1997, three weeks after being burned.

During the 1990s, King was subject to multiple break-ins and encountered Lyndon Fitzgerald Pace, a man who admitted killing women in the area. He broke into the house in the middle of the night and found her while she was sitting in her bed. After nearly eight years of staying in the home following the encounter, King moved to a condominium unit which had also been the home, albeit part-time, for singers Elton John and Janet Jackson. Her new home was a gift from Oprah Winfrey. In 1999, the King family finally succeeded in getting a jury verdict saying her husband was the victim of a murder conspiracy after suing Loyd Jowers, who claimed six years prior to having paid someone other than James Earl Ray to kill her husband. On April 4, 2000, King visited her husband&#x27;s grave with her sons, daughter Bernice and sister-in-law. Regarding plans to construct a monument for her husband in Washington, D.C., King said it would &quot;complete a group of memorials in the nation&#x27;s capital honoring democracy&#x27;s greatest leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and now Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; The National Park Service wanted to commemorate Martin Luther King&#x27;s dream, but they did not want any discussion of his opposition to the war in Vietnam or to his struggle to end poverty in America. Coretta Scott King fought to ensure that her husband&#x27;s legacy was not distorted and the history told at his monument in Washington D.C., was true to the Civil Rights Movement.
She became vegan in the last 10 years of her life.

=== Opposition to apartheid ===
During the 1980s, Coretta Scott King reaffirmed her long-standing opposition to apartheid, participating in a series of sit-in protests in Washington, D.C., that prompted nationwide demonstrations against South African racial policies.

King had a 10-day trip to South Africa in September 1986. On September 9, 1986, she cancelled meeting President P. W. Botha and Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. The next day, she met with Allan Boesak. The UDF leadership, Boesak and Winnie Mandela had threatened to avoid a meeting King if she met with Botha and Buthelezi. She also met with Winnie Mandela that day, and called it &quot;one of the greatest and most meaningful moments of my life.&quot; Nelson Mandela was still being imprisoned in Pollsmoor Prison after being transferred from Robben Island in 1982. Prior to leaving the United States for the meeting, King drew comparisons between the civil rights movement and Mandela&#x27;s case. Upon her return to the United States, she urged Reagan to approve economic sanctions against South Africa.

=== Peacemaking ===
Coretta Scott King was a long-time advocate for world peace. Author Michael Eric Dyson has called her &quot;an earlier and more devoted pacifist than her husband.&quot; Although King would object to the term &quot;pacifism&quot;, she was an advocate of non-violent direct action to achieve social change. In 1957, King was one of the founders of The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (now called Peace Action), and she spoke in San Francisco while her husband spoke in New York at the major anti-Vietnam war march on April 15, 1967, organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam.

King was vocal in her opposition to capital punishment and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

=== LGBT equality ===
In August 1983, in Washington, D. C., she urged amendment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include gays and lesbians as a protected class.

In response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1986 decision in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; that there was no constitutional right to engage in consensual sodomy, King&#x27;s long-time friend, Winston Johnson of Atlanta, came out to her and was instrumental in arranging King as the featured speaker at the September 27, 1986, New York Gala of the Human Rights Campaign Fund. As reported in the &quot;New York Native&quot;, King stated that she was there to express her solidarity with the gay and lesbian movement. She applauded gays as having &quot;always been a part of the civil rights movement&quot;.

On April 1, 1998, at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago, King called on the civil rights community to join in the struggle against homophobia and anti-gay bias. &quot;Homophobia is like racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood&quot;, she stated. &quot;This sets the stage for further repression and violence that spread all too easily to victimize the next minority group.&quot;

On March 31, 1998, at the 25th anniversary luncheon for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, King said: &quot;I still hear people say that I should not be talking about the rights of lesbian and gay people, and I should stick to the issue of racial justice. ... But I hasten to remind them that Martin Luther King, Jr., said, &#x27;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&#x27; ... I appeal to everyone who believes in Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x27;s, dream to make room at the table of brotherhood and sisterhood for lesbian and gay people.&quot; On November 9, 2000, she repeated similar remarks at the opening plenary session of the 13th annual Creating Change Conference, organized by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

In 2003, she invited the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force to take part in observances of the 40th anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther King&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. It was the first time that an LGBT rights group had been invited to a major event of the African-American community.

Her funeral was conducted by Bishop Eddie Long, which has been criticized by then-NAACP chairman Julian Bond who refused to attend it, stating that he &quot;just couldn&#x27;t imagine that she&#x27;d want to be in that church with a minister who was a raving homophobe&quot;.

=== The King Center ===
Established in 1968 by Coretta Scott King, The King Center is the official memorial dedicated to the advancement of the legacy and ideas of Martin Luther King Jr., leader of a nonviolent movement for justice, equality, and peace. Two days after her husband&#x27;s funeral, King began planning $15 million for funding the memorial. She handed the reins as CEO and president of the King Center down to her son, Dexter Scott King. The Kings initially had difficulty gathering the papers since they were in different locations, including colleges he attended and archives. King had a group of supporters begin gathering her husband&#x27;s papers in 1967, the year before his death. After raising funds from a private sector and the government, she financed the building of the complex in 1981.

In 1984, she came under criticism by Hosea Williams, one of her husband&#x27;s earliest followers, for having used the King Center to promote &quot;authentic material&quot; on her husband&#x27;s dreams and ideals, and disqualified the merchandise as an attempt to exploit her husband. She sanctioned the kit, which contained a wall poster, five photographs of King and his family, a cassette of the I Have a Dream speech, a booklet of tips on how to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day and five postcards with quotations from King himself. She believed it to be the authentic way to celebrate the holiday honoring her husband, and denied Hosea&#x27;s claims.

King sued her husband&#x27;s alma mater of Boston University over who would keep over 83,000 documents in December 1987 and said the documents belonged with the King archives. However, her husband was held to his word by the university; he had stated after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 that his papers would be kept at the college. Coretta&#x27;s lawyers argued that the statement was not binding and mentioned that King had not left a will at the time of his death. King testified that President of Boston University John R. Silber in a 1985 meeting demanded that she send the university all of her husband&#x27;s documents instead of the other way around. King released the statement, &quot;Dr. King wanted the south to be the repository of the bulk of his papers. Now that the King Center library and archives are complete and have one of the finest civil-rights collections in all the world, it is time for the papers to be returned home.&quot;

On January 17, 1992, President George H. W. Bush laid a wreath at the tomb of her husband and met with and was greeted by King at the center. King praised Bush&#x27;s support for the holiday, and joined hands with him at the end of a ceremony and sang &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;.
On May 6, 1993, a court rejected her claims to the papers after finding that a July 16, 1964 letter from Martin Luther King to the institute had constituted a binding charitable pledge to the university and outright stating that Martin Luther King retained ownership of his papers until giving them to the university as gifts or his death. King, however, said her husband had changed his mind about allowing Boston University to keep the papers. After her son Dexter took over as the president of the King Center for the second time in 1994, King was given more time to write, address issues and spend time with her parents.

=== Coretta Scott King Center for Cultural and Intellectual Freedom ===
In 2005, King gifted the use of her name to her alma mater, Antioch College in Yellow Springs, to create the Coretta Scott King Center as an experiential learning resource to address issues of race, class, gender, diversity, and social justice for the campus and the surrounding community. The center opened in 2007 on the Antioch College campus.

The center lists its mission as &quot;The Coretta Scott King Center facilitates learning, dialogue, and action to advance social justice&quot;, and its vision as &quot;To transform lives, the nation and the world by cultivating change agents, collaborating with communities, and fostering networks to advance human rights and social justice.&quot;

== Illness and death ==

By the end of 2004, Coretta began experiencing health problems. Her husband&#x27;s former secretary, Dora McDonald, assisted her part-time in this period. Hospitalized in April 2005, a month after speaking in Selma at the 40th anniversary of the Selma Voting Rights Movement, she was diagnosed with a heart condition and was discharged on her 78th and final birthday. Later, she suffered several small strokes. On August 16, 2005, she was hospitalized after suffering a stroke and a mild heart attack. Initially, she was unable to speak or move her right side. King&#x27;s daughter Bernice reported that she had been able to move her leg on Sunday, August 21 while her other daughter and oldest child Yolanda asserted that the family expected her to fully recover. She was released from Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta on September 22, 2005, after regaining some of her speech and continued physiotherapy at home. Due to continuing health problems, King canceled a number of speaking and traveling engagements throughout the remainder of 2005. 

On January 14, 2006, Coretta made her last public appearance in Atlanta at a dinner honoring her husband&#x27;s memory. On January 26, 2006, King checked into a rehabilitation center in Rosarito Beach, Mexico under a different name. Doctors did not learn her real identity until her medical records arrived the next day, and did not begin treatment due to her condition.

Coretta Scott King died in the late evening of January 30, 2006, at the rehabilitation center in Mexico, in the Oasis Hospital where she was undergoing holistic therapy for her stroke and advanced-stage ovarian cancer. The main cause of her death is believed to be respiratory failure due to complications from ovarian cancer. The clinic at which she died was called the Hospital Santa Mónica, but was licensed as Clínica Santo Tomás. After reports indicated that it was not legally licensed to &quot;perform surgery, take X-rays, perform laboratory work or run an internal pharmacy, all of which it was doing&quot;, as well as reports of it being operated by highly controversial medical figure Kurt Donsbach, it was shut down by medical commissioner Dr. Francisco Versa. 

King&#x27;s body was flown from Mexico to Atlanta on February 1, 2006. King&#x27;s eight-hour funeral at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia, was held on February 7. Bernice King delivered her eulogy. Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter attended, as did their wives, with the exception of former First Lady Barbara Bush, who had a previous engagement. The Ford family was absent due to the illness of President Gerald Ford (who himself died later that year). Prominent Georgian civil rights leader Julian Bond, an outspoken supporter of the rights of gays and lesbians, boycotted the service on the grounds that the King children had chosen an anti-gay megachurch as the venue. This was in conflict with their mother&#x27;s longstanding support for the rights of gay and lesbian people. Senator and future President Barack Obama, among other elected officials, attended the televised service. President Carter and Rev. Joseph Lowery delivered funeral orations and were critical of the Iraq War and the wiretapping of the Kings.

King was temporarily laid in a grave on the grounds of the King Center until a permanent place next to her husband&#x27;s remains could be built. She had expressed to family members and others that she wanted her remains to lie next to her husband&#x27;s at the King Center. On November 20, 2006, the new sarcophagus containing the bodies of the Kings was unveiled in front of friends and family. The sarcophagus is the third resting place of Martin Luther King and the second of Coretta.

== Family life ==
Martin often called Coretta &quot;Corrie&quot;, even when the two were still only dating.
The FBI captured a dispute between the couple in the middle of 1964, where the two both blamed each other for making the Civil Rights Movement even more difficult. Martin confessed in a 1965 sermon that his secretary had to remind him of his wife&#x27;s birthday and the couple&#x27;s wedding anniversary. For a time, many accompanying her husband would usually hear Coretta argue with him in telephone conversations. King resented her husband when he failed to call her to ask about the children while he was away and when she learned of his plans to not include her in formal visits, such as the White House. However, when King failed to meet his own standards by missing a plane and fell into a level of despair, Coretta told her husband over the phone that &quot;I believe in you, if that means anything.&quot; Author Ron Ramdin wrote &quot;King faced many new and trying moments, his refuge was home and closeness to Coretta, whose calm and soothing voice whenever she sang, gave him renewed strength. She was the rock upon which his marriage and civil rights leadership, especially at this time of crisis, was founded.&quot;

After she succeeded in getting Martin Luther King Jr. Day made a federal holiday, King said her husband&#x27;s dream was &quot;for people of all religions, all socio-economic levels, and all cultures to create a world community free from violence, poverty, racism, and war so that they could live together in what he called the beloved community or his world house concept.&quot;

King considered raising children in a society that discriminated against them seriously, and spoke against her husband whenever the two disagreed on the financial needs of their family. The Kings had four children; Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice. All four children later followed in their parents&#x27; footsteps as civil rights activists. Her daughter Bernice referred to her as &quot;My favorite person&quot;. Years after King&#x27;s death, Bernice would say her mother &quot;spearheaded the effort to establish the King Center in Atlanta as the official living memorial for Martin Luther King Jr., and then went on to champion a national holiday commemorating our father&#x27;s birthday, and a host of other efforts; and so in many respects she paved the way and made it possible for the most hated man in America in 1968 to now being one of the most revered and loved men in the world.&quot; Dexter Scott King&#x27;s resigning four months after becoming president of the King Center has often been attributed to differences with his mother. Dexter&#x27;s work saw a reduction of workers from 70 to 14, and also removed a child care center his mother had founded. She lived in a small house with 4 children.

== Lawsuits ==

The King family has mostly been criticized for their handling of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s estate, both while Coretta was alive and after her death. The King family sued a California auction in 1992, the family&#x27;s attorneys filing claims of stolen property against Superior Galleries in Los Angeles Superior Court for the document&#x27;s return. The King family additionally sued the auction house for punitive damages.

In 1994, &quot;USA Today&quot; paid the family $10,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees and court costs and also a $1,700 licensing fee for using the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech without permission from them. CBS was sued by the King estate for copyright infringement in November 1996. The network marketed a tape containing excerpts of the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. CBS had filmed the speech when Martin Luther King Jr. delivered it in 1963 and did not pay the family a licensing fee.

On April 8, 1998, King met with attorney general Janet Reno as requested by President Bill Clinton. Their meeting took place at the Justice Department four days after the thirtieth anniversary of her husband&#x27;s death. On July 29, 1998, Mrs. King and her son Dexter met with Justice Department officials. The following day, Associate Attorney General Raymond Fisher told reporters, &quot;We discussed with them orally what kind of process we would follow to see if that meets their concerns. And we think it should, but they&#x27;re thinking about it.&quot; On October 2, 1998, the King family filed a suit against Loyd Jowers after he stated publicly he had been paid to hire an assassin to kill Martin Luther King. Mrs. King&#x27;s son Dexter met with Jowers, and the family contended that the shot that killed Martin Luther King came from behind a dense bushy area behind Jim&#x27;s Grill. The shooter was identified by James Earl Ray&#x27;s lawyers as Earl Clark, a police officer at the time of King&#x27;s death, who had been dead for several years before the trial and lawsuits emerged. Jowers himself refused to identify the man he claimed killed Martin Luther King, as a favor to who he confirmed as the deceased killer with alleged ties to organized crimes. The King lawsuit sought unspecified damages from Jowers and other &quot;unknown coconspirators&quot;. On November 16, 1999, Mrs. King testified that she hoped the truth would be brought about, regarding the assassination of her husband. Mrs. King believed that while Ray might have had a role in her husband&#x27;s death, she did not believe he was the one to &quot;really, actually kill him&quot;. She was the first member of the King family to testify at the trial, and noted that the family believed Ray did not act alone. It was at this time that King called for President Bill Clinton to establish a national commission to investigate the assassination, as she believed &quot;such a commission could make a major contribution to interracial healing and reconciliation in America.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Coretta was viewed during her lifetime and posthumously as having strived to preserve her husband&#x27;s legacy. The King Center, which she created the year of his assassination, allowed her husband&#x27;s tomb to be memorialized. King was buried with her husband after her death, on February 7, 2006. King &quot;fought to preserve his legacy&quot; and her construction of the King Center is said to have aided in her efforts.

King has been linked and associated with Jacqueline Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy, as the three all lost their husbands to assassinations. The three were together when Coretta flew to Los Angeles after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy to be with Ethel and shared &quot;colorblind compassion&quot;. She has also been compared to Michelle Obama, the first African-American First Lady of the United States.

She is seen as being primarily responsible for the creation of the federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The holiday is now observed in all fifty states and has been since 2000. The first observance of the holiday after her death was commemorated with speeches, visits to the couple&#x27;s tomb, and the opening of a collection of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s papers. Her sister-in-law Christine King Farris said, &quot;It is in her memory and her honor that we must carry this program on. This is as she would have it.&quot;

On February 7, 2017, Republicans in the Senate voted that Senator Elizabeth Warren had violated Senate rule 19 during the debate on attorney general nominee Senator Jeff Sessions, claiming that she impugned his character when she quoted statements made about Sessions by Coretta and Senator Ted Kennedy. &quot;Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen&quot;, Coretta wrote in a 1986 letter to Senator Strom Thurmond, which Warren attempted to read on the Senate floor. This action prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions&#x27; nomination for United States Attorney General. Instead, she stepped into a nearby room and continued reading Coretta&#x27;s letter while streaming live on the Internet.

== Recognition and tributes ==
Coretta Scott King was the recipient of various honors and tributes both before and after her death. She received honorary degrees from many institutions, including Princeton University, Duke University, and Bates College. She was honored by both of her alma maters in 2004, receiving a Horace Mann Award from Antioch College and an Outstanding Alumni Award from the New England Conservatory of Music.

In 1970, the American Library Association began awarding a medal named for Coretta Scott King to outstanding African-American writers and illustrators of children&#x27;s literature. In 1984, she received a special citation from the award as the editor of &quot;The Words of Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot;

In 1978, Women&#x27;s Way awarded King with their first Lucretia Mott Award for showing a dedication to the advancement of women and justice similar to Lucretia Mott&#x27;s.

Many individuals and organizations paid tribute to Scott King following her death, including U.S. President George W. Bush, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Black Justice Coalition, and her alma mater Antioch College.

In 1983 she received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Worship. She received the Key of Life award from the NAACP. In 1987 she received a Candace Award for Distinguished Service from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women.

In 1997, Coretta Scott King was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2004, Coretta Scott King was awarded the prestigious Gandhi Peace Prize by the Government of India.

In 2006, the Jewish National Fund, the organization that works to plant trees in Israel, announced the creation of the Coretta Scott King forest in the Galilee region of Northern Israel, with the purpose of &quot;perpetuating her memory of equality and peace&quot;, as well as the work of her husband. When she learned about this plan, King wrote to Israel&#x27;s parliament:

In 2007, The Coretta Scott King Young Women&#x27;s Leadership Academy (CSKYWLA) was opened in Atlanta, Georgia. At its inception, the school served girls in grade 6 with plans for expansion to grade 12 by 2014. CSKYWLA is a public school in the Atlanta Public Schools system. Among the staff and students, the acronym for the school&#x27;s name, CSKYWLA (pronounced &quot;see-skee-WAH-lah&quot;), has been coined as a protologism to which this definition has given – &quot;to be empowered by scholarship, non-violence, and social change.&quot; That year was also the first observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day following her death, and she was also honored.
Super Bowl XL was dedicated to King and Rosa Parks. Both were memorialized with a moment of silence during the pregame ceremonies. The children of both Parks and King then helped Tom Brady with the ceremonial coin toss. In addition two choirs representing the states of Georgia (King&#x27;s home state) and Alabama (Park&#x27;s home state) accompanied Dr. John, Aretha Franklin and Aaron Neville in the singing of the national anthem.

She was inducted into the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2009. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2011.

In January 2023, &quot;The Embrace&quot; was unveiled in Boston; this sculpture commemorates Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, and depicts four intertwined arms, representing the hug they shared after he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.

=== Congressional resolutions ===
Upon the news of her death, moments of reflection, remembrance, and mourning began around the world. In the United States Senate, Majority Leader Bill Frist presented Senate Resolution 362 on behalf of all U.S. Senators, with the afternoon hours filled with respectful tributes throughout the U.S. Capitol.

On August 31, 2006, following a moment of silence in memoriam of the death of Coretta Scott King, the United States House of Representatives presented House Resolution 655 in honor of her legacy. In an unusual action, the resolution included a grace period of five days in which further comments could be added to it.

<text>HMAS &quot;Collins&quot; (SSG 73) is the lead vessel of the six-submarine &quot;Collins&quot; class operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Named for Vice Admiral Sir John Augustine Collins, &quot;Collins&quot; was laid down in February 1990, and was the only submarine of the class to be partially constructed by Kockums&#x27; Malmo shipyard. The boat was launched in August 1993, but was not completed until ten months later. Numerous problems with the class were exposed by the lengthy sea trials period undertaken by the boat; &quot;Collins&quot; was not commissioned into the RAN until mid-1996, eighteen months behind schedule, and the submarine was not cleared for operational deployments until 2000. 

With the decommissioning of HMAS Anzac on 18 May 2024, &quot;Collins&quot; became the First Lady of the Fleet as the longest serving commissioned RAN vessel.

==Construction==
Collins was laid down in February 1990. The two most complex sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums&#x27; shipyard in Malmö, Sweden, while the other four sections and complete assembly of the submarine occurred at Australian Submarine Corporation&#x27;s facility in Port Adelaide, South Australia. It was originally planned to construct the first submarine completely overseas, but by the time the tender was awarded, it had been decided to build all six submarines in Australia; the increase in cost by not building the lead ship in the winning designer&#x27;s home shipyard were believed to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries.

While the bow section of the first boat was being assembled in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: the steel alloy used for the hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding but failed to make this clear; delays in delivering the steel plates to Kockums resulted in rushing the work and the resulting drop in quality. It was proposed that the section be kept by Kockums to repair the welds, but it was decided to accept the section as-is and repair the welds at ASC to minimise delays in the project.
The launch of &quot;Collins&quot; was originally planned for 1994, but was later set for August 1993. The submarine was launched by shiplift on 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: the design of the submarine had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings had not been installed, the components of the combat system had not been delivered, and some sections of &#x27;hull&#x27; were sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, the boat was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that she was completed. Work on the other submarines in the class was delayed by the extra effort put in for &quot;Collins&quot; to meet her launching date, and by the subsequent work to complete her. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: &quot;Collins&quot; was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction.

&quot;Collins&quot; was named for Vice Admiral Sir John Augustine Collins; famous for commanding during her Mediterranean deployment in 1940–41, and becoming the first Australian to command a naval squadron in 1944.

==Characteristics==

The &quot;Collins&quot; class is an enlarged version of the &quot;Västergötland&quot;-class submarine designed by Kockums. At in length, with a beam of and a waterline depth of , displacing 3,051 tonnes when surfaced, and 3,353 tonnes when submerged, they are the largest conventionally powered submarines in the world. The hull is constructed from high-tensile micro-alloy steel, and are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar. The depth that they can dive to is classified: most sources claim that it is over ,

The submarine is armed with six torpedo tubes, and carry a standard payload of 22 torpedoes: originally a mix of Gould Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and UGM-84C Sub-Harpoon, with the Mark 48s later upgraded to the Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) version.

Each submarine is equipped with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400 kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The electricity generated is stored in batteries, then supplied to a single Jeumont-Schneider DC motor, which provides 7,200 shaft horsepower to a single, seven-bladed, diameter skewback propeller. The &quot;Collins&quot; class has a speed of when surfaced and at snorkel depth, and can reach underwater. The submarines have a range of at when surfaced, at at snorkel depth. When submerged completely, a &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine can travel at maximum speed, or at . Each boat has an endurance of 70 days.

==Sea trials==

===Training===
Assembly of the crew for &quot;Collins&quot; began in 1992. Problems with the &quot;Collins&quot; trials began in mid-1992, when it was discovered that appropriate training materials and courses in the operation of the new submarine design had been poorly prepared, was inadequate, and often did not reflect the reality of operating the boats.

Several causes were identified: the late completion of the design made preparing training materials difficult, subcontractors did not always provide detailed information on the operation of their equipment, the combat system training was based on the completed version of the software and not the partial system installed in &quot;Collins&quot;, and the training assumed that none of the systems would break down. The last problem was part of an overall attitude that the first boat would be perfect off the production line and that no breakdowns would occur, and as a result, early equipment manuals tended to be light on content, and &quot;Collins&quot; would be sent to sea with few spare parts.

During sea trials, the submarine was often forced back to port because of equipment problems, where the Navy personnel found that ASC engineers would diagnose and repair systems using a combination of supplier data and diagnostic tools not available to the sailors. Problems with the training were compounded by an attitude from ASC that problems were always the fault of the Navy operators. However, most were the result of equipment failure, and the problems caused by operator error could be attributed to poor training or a lack of training, both of which were the responsibility of ASC.

To supplement this training, several officers and sailors assigned to &quot;Collins&quot; were sent to Sweden to train with the Swedish Navy aboard the &quot;Västergötland&quot;-class submarines; the class on which the &quot;Collins&quot;-class design was based.

===Trials===
Evaluation of the submarine was based on attaining a series of licenses, gradually testing the capabilities of &quot;Collins&quot; and those operating her from surface sailing to deep, unaccompanied dives. The main motor was started for the first time on 8 August 1994, as part of a series of &#x27;basin trials&#x27;. &quot;Collins&quot; officially commenced sea trials at when she departed the ASC wharf at 10:00 on 31 October 1994. By the time the submarine had exited Port Adelaide, two of the three diesel generators had broken down. The submarine submerged for the first time on 9 November, remaining underwater for twelve hours.

The submarine was removed from the water at the end of 1994 to allow ASC to further complete the fitting out of the boat and perform repairs to the hull. Although sea trials resumed in early 1995, &quot;Collins&quot; did not dive again until 9 June, when it was decided that the status of the combat system drop was sufficient to allow further underwater tests of the submarine. The tests went without difficulty until the next day, when the anchor cable snapped in poor weather, forcing &quot;Collins&quot; to return to port. When approaching the ASC wharf, a programming problem with the propulsion switchboard caused the main motor to cut out. &quot;Collins&quot; drifted into the wharf, hitting the construction facility&#x27;s shiplift at . The backup motor then belatedly engaged, causing the submarine to collide with , the ship assigned to assist in the submarine&#x27;s sea trials. Repairs to the sonar dome cost A$250,000.

Deep diving tests were delayed until the acquisition of the submarine rescue vessel &quot;Remora&quot; in December 1995. &quot;Collins&quot; performed her first deep dive on 19 January 1996 without any problems. However, during a later deep dive trial, the propeller shaft seal began to leak excessively. Although designed to leak at an hour, the seal had previously shown itself to be faulty, with an hourly leak rate in the hundreds of litres. On this occasion, the water pressure meant the flow rate was significantly greater, to the point where the aft bilge pump was barely keeping up. When the senior engineer entered the compartment, he found personnel trying to stem the flow, including one sailor who was underneath the shaft, attempting to tighten the seal manually. The engineer instructed the commander to take the submarine to the surface as quickly as possible, but keep the boat level—had the engineer instead informed the commander that the submarine was flooding, &quot;Collins&quot; would have blown all ballast and driven for the surface at a steep angle, likely drowning the sailor under the shaft. &quot;Collins&quot; reached the surface without further incident. Modified seals were fitted to all submarines to bring the leak back to the accepted rate. It was later calculated that the submarine was taking on water at over a minute.

Multiple mechanical problems appeared during the sea trials. Many of the problems encountered in &quot;Collins&quot; were quickly repaired, and did not occur again or in the other five submarines. Recurring issues were usually associated with diesel engines, propeller shaft seals, periscopes and masts, hydraulic couplings, and the combat system. At the same time, many of the systems worked with few or no problems, with the submarine meeting or exceeding design specifications for maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and submerged endurance, particularly at low speeds. The ship control system, which had been a major concern during development of the class, functioned beyond positive expectation. The submarine&#x27;s autopilot (which aboard &quot;Collins&quot; was nicknamed &#x27;Sven&#x27;) was found to be better at depth keeping during snorting than many of the operators.

&quot;Collins&quot; was due to be commissioned in November 1995. The submarine was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision and installation of the combat data system software. &quot;Collins&quot; was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.

==Operational history==
In May 1997, two groups of six female sailors were posted to &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Farncomb&quot; as a test on the feasibility of mixed-sex crews aboard submarines. Following the trial&#x27;s success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced training for the submarine service in 1998.

In mid-2000, &quot;Collins&quot; was sent to Ketchikan, Alaska for noise testing with the United States Navy. Although noise testing in Australia was believed to have been affected by natural background noise, the Alaskan tests confirmed the Australian results. Low-speed testing showed that the &quot;Collins&quot; class was almost undetectable at patrol speed.

In August 2000, &quot;Collins&quot; became the first of her class to fire a Harpoon missile.

When &quot;Collins&quot; returned to the ASC facility in April 2001 for a year-long maintenance docking, multiple welding defects were found in both the bow and escape tower sections of the submarine—the two sections constructed by Kockums, while almost no problems were found in the welding of the four Australian-built sections. Repairing these welds quadrupled the time &quot;Collins&quot; spent in dock.

&quot;Collins&quot; completed a full-cycle docking at ASC on 29 July 2005. During this period she was modified to improve her ability to land special forces personnel.

In July 2009, while exercising in the Great Australian Bight, two of the three diesel generators aboard &quot;Collins&quot; failed, forcing the submarine to limp back to base. The cause was believed to be errors during the submarine&#x27;s last refit, with the boat undergoing major maintenance as of December 2009. Although back in service by February 2010, the boat was limited in her duties, but was predicted to be fully operational by May 2010. The Australian government is seeking A$5 million in compensation from ASC for the error.

During the first part of 2012, &quot;Collins&quot; participated in numerous naval exercises, before commencing a full-cycle maintenance docking.

The submarines are predicted to have an operational life of around 30 years, with &quot;Collins&quot; to be decommissioned around 2025.

<text>HMAS &quot;Farncomb&quot; (SSG 74) is the second of six s operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Named for Rear Admiral Harold Farncomb, the submarine was laid down in 1993 and launched in December 1995—the first submarine to be completely constructed in Australia. A combination of factors led to &quot;Farncomb&quot; being the only vessel of her class in operational condition in mid-2009.

The &quot;Collins&quot; class is an enlarged version of the submarine designed by Kockums. At in length, with a beam of and a waterline depth of , displacing 3,051 tonnes when surfaced, and 3,353 tonnes when submerged, they are the largest conventionally powered submarines in the world. The hull is constructed from high-tensile micro-alloy steel, and are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar.

When submerged completely, a &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine can travel at maximum speed, or at . Each boat has an endurance of 70 days.

==Construction and trials==
&quot;Farncomb&quot; was laid down by Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) on 3 March 1991. She was named for Rear Admiral Harold Farncomb; the first Australian-trained officer promoted to captain, and commanding officer of the flagship from 1941 to 1944. Work on the boat was delayed by the need to complete sister boat and class lead to a launchable condition by her set launch date of 28 August 1993. To free up resources at ASC for &quot;Collins&quot;, &quot;Farncomb&quot;″s bow section was sent to Newcastle for completion.

&quot;Farncomb&quot; was launched on 15 December 1995: as she was the first submarine to be completely constructed in Australia (two sections of &quot;Collins&quot; had been assembled in Sweden), the submarine wore a large Made In Australia logo on the fin. The submarine commenced sea trials in September 1996. Lessons learned from the trials of lead boat &quot;Collins&quot; benefitted &quot;Farncomb&quot;, with training materials improved and the trials crew instructed to familiarise themselves with the submarine while she was being completed (the crew of &quot;Collins&quot; had the option to, but most personnel did not). The trial program was impacted on by problems with &quot;Collins&quot;.

&quot;Farncomb&quot; was provisionally accepted into service by the RAN at the end of 1997. She was formally commissioned into the RAN on 31 January 1998.

==Operational history==
In May 1997, two groups of six female sailors were posted to &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Farncomb&quot; as a test on the feasibility of mixed-sex crews aboard submarines. Following the trial&#x27;s success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced training for the submarine service in 1998.

In 1998, while returning from Timor, all three of &quot;Farncomb&quot;″s diesel generators broke down. The submarine limped to Darwin, where she waited several weeks for replacement parts to be organised and transported.

As part of combat system trials, &quot;Farncomb&quot; fired a live Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedo at on 14 June 1999, sinking the decommissioned destroyer escort.

On 19 March 2007, during a five-month intelligence-gathering mission in Asian waters, fishing lines became entangled in &quot;Fancomb&quot;″s propeller. The submarine surfaced in international waters during the night, and five sailors were out on the casing attempting to free the propeller when the weather suddenly worsened and the sailors were washed overboard. A rescue party, involving three volunteer swimmers was successful in retrieving the five sailors during a ninety-minute effort, and the submarine continued on without detection. The incident remained classified until August 2009, when the RAN nominated the three rescue swimmers for bravery decorations, the first submariners to be nominated since a 1981 incident aboard .

In 2008 and 2009, personnel shortages reduced the number of submarines able to be deployed to three, with the maintenance schedule and battery malfunctions on several boats combining to reduce this to one, &quot;Farncomb&quot; in mid-2009.

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Farncomb&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The submarine did not participate in the fleet entry, but was anchored in the harbour for the review.

In January 2010, &quot;Farncomb&quot; was forced to return to port for urgent repairs after a generator failure. This left sister boat as the only fully operational submarine, with on restricted duties, and the other three submarines undergoing repairs or maintenance.

In August 2011, &quot;Farncomb&quot; suddenly lost propulsion while using the schnorkel at periscope depth off Rottnest Island. The restart did not function, and the boat began falling backwards. A full emergency ballast blow brought the submarine to the surface, and the engine was restarted.

&quot;Farncomb&quot; was deployed to Hawaii to participate in the 2012 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) multinational exercise. On 22 July, the submarine fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the former ammunition ship , breaking the ship in two and sinking her. A few days later, a hose in the submarine&#x27;s weight compensation system split while the boat was recharging her batteries, causing flooding. &quot;Farncomb&quot; surfaced from periscope depth without major incident and sailed to Pearl Harbor for repairs.
In October 2013, &quot;Farncomb&quot; was the only submarine to participate in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney. During November 2013, &quot;Farncomb&quot; participated in the Black Carillion 2013 submarine escape training exercise. She began a full docking cycle refit in 2014, with most of her crew transferring across to . She returned to the Fleet in August 2016.

&quot;Farncomb&quot; returned to base at Fleet Base West, Rockingham, in August 2019 after a five month deployment during which she participated in the international exercises Bersama Shield, Pacific Vanguard and Talisman Sabre.

In October 2022 &quot;Farncomb&quot; visited Yokosuka in Japan to participate in an international fleet review organised to mark the 70th anniversary of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force.

In September 2023, &quot;Farncomb&quot; suffered a small electrical fire while on routine patrol. The Australian Defence Forces stated that the crew quickly extinguished the fire and no crew members were injured. The ship continued on patrol.

HMAS &quot;Farncomb&quot; is expected to undergo sustainment and capability enhancements under the Life-of-Type Extension (LOTE) program in 2026, extending her service life into the 2030&#x27;s. She will be the first &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine to receive the upgrades.

<text>HMAS &quot;Waller&quot; (SSG 75) is the third of six &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Named for Captain Hector Waller, the boat was laid down in 1992, and launched in 1997. Despite the RAN initially refusing to accept the submarine for service, &quot;Waller&quot; has demonstrated the capabilities of the &quot;Collins&quot; class against surface and submarine targets during several international war-games.

==Construction==
&quot;Waller&quot; was laid down by Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) on 19 March 1992, launched on 14 March 1997, and commissioned into the RAN on 10 July 1999. During sea trials, the number of problems and defects with &quot;Waller&quot; were significantly fewer that with the previous two submarines, indicating that problems with earlier submarines were being fixed in the latter boats during construction.

Despite this, the RAN initially refused to accept &quot;Waller&quot; into service until all defects in the submarine were repaired, unlike &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Farncomb&quot;, which had been provisionally accepted while defects were fixed. Although ASC believed that all problems with &quot;Waller&quot; had been rectified, the Defence Acquisition Organisation refused to accept the boat. In response, ASC began to charge the Australian Government A$100,000 a day over contract for the delays. Despite legal opinion being that ASC did not have the right to make that claim, the Government eventually paid half of what was claimed.

&quot;Waller&quot; was named for Captain Hector Waller, who commanded the five-ship &#x27;Scrap Iron Flotilla&#x27; from 1940 to 1941, then commanded the cruiser until his death and the ship&#x27;s loss on 1 March 1942 during the Battle of Sunda Strait.

In 1999, &quot;Waller&quot; reportedly operated in the International Force East Timor (INTERFET) together with a second &quot;Collins&quot;-class boat providing escorts for transport ships and monitoring Indonesian communications. &quot;Waller&quot; had overtly docked in Darwin during the international naval buildup in September shortly before the Force sailed to East Timor.

In late May 2000, &quot;Waller&quot; became the first Australian submarine to operate as a fully integrated component of a United States Navy carrier battle group during wargames. &quot;Waller&quot;’s role was to search for and engage opposing submarines hunting the aircraft carrier , a role in which she performed better than expected. A few days later, as part of the RIMPAC 2000 exercise, &quot;Waller&quot; was assigned to act as an &#x27;enemy&#x27; submarine, and was reported to have successfully engaged two USN nuclear submarines before coming into attacking range of &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. &quot;Waller&quot; performed similarly during the Operation Tandem Thrust wargames in 2001, when she &#x27;sank&#x27; two USN amphibious assault ships in waters just over deep; although the submarine was &#x27;destroyed&#x27; herself later in the exercise.

During a multinational exercise in September 2003, which was attended by &quot;Waller&quot; and sister boat &quot;Rankin&quot;, &quot;Waller&quot; successfully &quot;sank&quot; a &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class nuclear submarine, prompting claims from the USN that diesel submarines like the &quot;Collins&quot; class are one of the major threats facing modern navies.

In 2006, the Mark 48 torpedoes carried by the &quot;Collins&quot; class were upgraded to the Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) version, which had been jointly developed with the United States Navy. &quot;Waller&quot; was the first vessel of either navy to fire an armed version of the torpedo, sinking the decommissioned &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer on 16 July 2008, during RIMPAC 08.

In early 2009, battery problems aboard &quot;Waller&quot; forced the submarine to undergo emergency maintenance. This, combined with other factors affecting &quot;Waller&quot;’s sister boats, left as the only operational submarine in Australian service as of mid-2009. The boat was returned to service during the end of the year, but maintenance delays and malfunctions aboard other submarines during early 2010, meant that &quot;Waller&quot; was the only fully operational submarine during February and March 2010.

&quot;Waller&quot; was undergoing deep maintenance during 2012, and was due to return to service in 2013.

On 27 February 2014, a fire broke out aboard the submarine while she was surfaced off the Western Australian coast. The fire was extinguished by those aboard, and there were no injuries, although four personnel who fought the fire directly were taken ashore for medical observation. &quot;Waller&quot; was docked for repairs, which were due to be completed by the end of 2015, with the submarine returning to full operational status in mid-2016.

&quot;Waller&quot; was damaged by two fires in an auxiliary machine space on 8 April 2021. At the time the submarine was alongside at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;. Repairs were completed in September 2021.

In June 2022, Vice-Admiral Michael Noonan smuggled a civilian on board, his girlfriend, for an overnight trip and proposed marriage to her.

<text>Hesperocyparis macrocarpa also known as Cupressus macrocarpa, or the Monterey cypress is a coniferous tree, and is one of several species of cypress trees native to California.

The Monterey cypress is found naturally only on the Central Coast of California. Due to being a glacial relict, the natural distributional range of the species during modern times is confined to two small relict populations near Carmel, California, at Cypress Point in Pebble Beach and at Point Lobos. Historically during the peak of the last ice age, Monterey cypress would have likely comprised a much larger forest that extended much further north and south.

== Description ==
&quot;Hesperocyparis macrocarpa&quot; is a medium-sized coniferous evergreen tree, which often becomes irregular and flat-topped as a result of the strong winds that are typical of its native area. It grows to heights of up to 40 meters (133 feet) in perfect growing conditions, and its trunk diameter can reach 2.5 meters (over 8 feet). The foliage grows in dense sprays which are bright green in color and release a deep lemony aroma when crushed. The leaves are scale-like, 2–5 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots; seedlings up to a year old have needle-like leaves 4–8 mm long.

The seed cones are globose to oblong, 20–40 mm long, with 6–14 scales, green at first, maturing brown about 20–24 months after pollination. The pollen cones are 3–5 mm long, and release their pollen in late winter or early spring. The Latin specific epithet &quot;macrocarpa&quot; means &quot;with large fruit&quot;.

Because of the large trunk size some trees develop, people have assumed that individual &quot;H. macrocarpa&quot; trees may be up to 2,000 years old. However, the longest-lived report based on physical evidence is only 284 years old. The renowned Californian botanist Willis Linn Jepson wrote that &quot;the advertisement of [&quot;C. macrocarpa&quot; trees] in seaside literature as 1,000 to 2,000 years old does not ... rest upon any actual data, and probably represents a desire to minister to a popular craving for superlatives&quot;. Few trees survive beyond 100 years. As a counterpoint to this, many of the earliest introductions of the species into New Zealand around 1860 still survive and the major cause of mortality of these cultivated specimens is felling. One such example is the 160 year old St. Barnabas Church tree in Stoke, Nelson, New Zealand.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Hesperocyparis macrocarpa&quot; was given its first scientific description by the German botanist Karl Theodor Hartweg with the name &quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot;. Hartweg&#x27;s trip to California coincided with the Mexican–American War. He observed in his report, &quot;Under these circumstances I cannot venture far away from Monterey, nor is it advisable that I should do so, as I might fall in with a party of country people, who could not be persuaded that a person would come all the way from London to look after weeds, which in their opinion are not worth picking up, but might suppose that I have some political object in view; I, therefore, confine my excursions within a few miles of the town.&quot; In July 1846 he observed the Monterey cypress trees and named them, though his paper was not received in London until 10 May of the following year.

Along with other New World &quot;Cupressus&quot; species, it has recently been transferred to the genus &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot;, on genetic evidence that the New World &quot;Cupressus&quot; (NWC) are not very closely related to the Old World &quot;Cupressus&quot; (OWC) species.

&quot;Hesperocyparis macrocarpa&quot; is a paleoendemic, with fossilized remains discovered in Drakes Bay and Rancho La Brea evidencing a much larger extent in the past.

Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear DNA sequences and organismic data recover distinct lineages, with the NWC being sister to &quot;Juniperus&quot; or &quot;Juniperus&quot; and the OWC. However, chloroplast sequences sometimes place both OWC and NWC with a common ancestor, possibly due to ancient hybridization. Other more obvious morphological differences support their separation, such as the presence of 3 to 5 cotyledons in NWC, as opposed to 2 in Old World species, glaucous seed coats, and monomorphic leaves on ultimate branch segments.

Analysis of phylogenetic relationships show that the species is placed within the &quot;Macrocarpa&quot; clade, which diverged from the &quot;Arizonica&quot; clade, both within &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot;. The two clades are separated biogeographically by the Transverse Ranges, which forms a barrier to any north–south migration of most species within these clades.

== Distribution ==
The two native cypress forest stands are protected, within Point Lobos State Natural Reserve and Del Monte Forest. The natural habitat is noted for its cool, moist summers, frequently enveloping the trees in sea fog.

This species has been widely planted outside its native range, particularly along the coasts of California and Oregon. Its European distribution includes Great Britain (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), France, Ireland, Greece, Italy and Portugal. In New Zealand, plantings have naturalized, finding conditions there more favorable than in its native range. It has also been grown experimentally as a timber crop in Kenya.

The tree has been successfully planted in Sri Lanka, with a 130-year old specimen on view at the Hakgala Botanical Garden in Nuwara Eliya.

&quot;Hesperocyparis macrocarpa&quot; is also grown in South Africa. For example, a copse has been planted to commemorate South African infantrymen who died in the Allied cause in Italy and North Africa during World War 2. As in California, the Cape trees are gnarled and wind-sculpted.

==Cultivation==
Monterey cypress has been widely cultivated away from its native range, both elsewhere along the California coast, and in other areas with similar cool summer, mild winter oceanic climates. It was very early cultivated in the United Kingdom. In 1846 Karl Hartweg sent the Royal Horticultural Society seeds along with a report on his journeys in California. It is a popular private garden and public landscape tree in California. It is so widely planted in Golden Gate Park that the silhouette of the tree is sometimes printed as a symbol of the park.

When planted in areas with hot summers, for example in interior California away from the coastal fog belt, Monterey cypress has proved highly susceptible to cypress canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Seiridium cardinale&quot;, and rarely survives more than a few years. This disease is not a problem where summers are cool.

The foliage is slightly toxic to livestock and can cause miscarriages in cattle. Sawn logs are used by many craftspeople, some boat builders and small manufacturers, as a furniture structural material and a decorative wood because of its fine colours, though it must be preserved carefully to prevent the wood from splitting. It is also a fast, hot burning, albeit sparky (therefore not suited to open fires), firewood.

=== In Australasia ===
In Australia and New Zealand, Monterey cypress is most frequently grown as a windbreak tree on farms, usually in rows or shelter belts. It is also planted in New Zealand as an ornamental tree and, occasionally, as a timber tree. There, finding more favorable growing conditions than in its native range, and in the absence of many native pathogens, it often grows much larger, with trees recorded at over tall and in trunk diameter. One specimen – with a trunk diameter of more than – is considered to be the largest recorded single-stemmed specimen in the world. The timber of Monterey cypress was used for fence posts on New Zealand farms before electric fencing became popular.

=== Cultivars ===
A number of cultivars have been selected for garden use, including Goldcrest, with yellow-green, semi-juvenile foliage (with spreading scale-leaf tips) and Lutea with yellow-green foliage. Goldcrest has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).

Monterey cypress is one of the parents of the fast-growing cultivated hybrid Leyland cypress, &quot;Cupressus&quot; × &quot;Leylandii&quot;, the other parent being Nootka cypress (&quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis)&quot;.

&quot;Hesperocyparis macrocarpa&quot; cultivars grown in New Zealand are:
*&#x27;Aurea Saligna&#x27;—long cascades of weeping, golden-yellow, thread-like foliage on a pyramidal tree
*&#x27;Brunniana Aurea&#x27;—pillar or conical form with soft rich-golden foliage
*&#x27;Gold Rocket&#x27;—narrow erect form with golden colouring, slow-growing
*&#x27;Golden Pillar&#x27;—compact conical tree with dense yellow shoots and foliage
*&#x27;Greenstead Magnificent&#x27;—dwarf form with blue-green foliage
*&#x27;Lambertiana Aurea&#x27;—hardy upright form tolerating poor soil and climate conditions

== Chemistry ==
Isocupressic acid, a labdane diterpenoid, is an abortifacient component of &quot;H. macrocarpa&quot;. Monoterpenes (α- and γ-terpinene and terpinolene) are constituents of the foliage volatile oil. The oil exact composition is : α-pinene (20.2%), sabinene (12.0%), p-Cymene (7.0%) and terpinen-4-ol (29.6%). Unusual sesquiterpenes can be found in the foliage. Longiborneol (also known as juniperol or macrocarpol) can also be isolated from Monterey cypresses.

<text>Golden Spike National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park located at Promontory Summit, north of the Great Salt Lake in east-central Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The nearest city is Corinne, approximately east-southeast of the site.

It commemorates the completion of the first Transcontinental Railroad where the Central Pacific Railroad and the first Union Pacific Railroad met on May 10, 1869. The final joining of the rails spanning the continent was signified by the driving of the ceremonial golden spike.

==Background==

The Golden Spike National Historical Park encompasses . Initially just when it was established in 1957, limited to the area near the junction of the two rail systems, the site was expanded by in 1965 through land swaps and acquisition of approximately a strip of land mostly wide along of the former railroad right-of-way. It reached its present size in 1980. In addition to the Summit site where the rails were joined, the Park includes the two linear areas known as the west slope (west of the junction) and the east slope (east of the junction), which include worker campsites, partially-completed grades, incomplete cuts, specialty workshops, and two historical landmarks: where the Central Pacific finished its &quot;Ten miles of track, laid in one day&quot; tracklaying record (west slope) and where the Big Fill and Big Trestle were completed (east slope).

Although the line was abandoned in 1904 (bypassed by the Lucin Cutoff) and the original rails were removed in 1942 to serve the war effort, the site presently includes of rebuilt track from the summit area (where the rail systems were joined) to a train storage building. The rebuilt track was designed to be an authentic representation of the 1869 rails.

In 2002, it received 49,950 visitors. annual visitation ranges from 48,000 to 64,000.

The first monument erected at the site was a concrete obelisk built by the Southern Pacific Railroad (successor to the Central Pacific) . It has since been moved several times, but can presently be seen near the 1969 Visitor Center.

Bernice Gibbs Anderson founded and led the movement to have the site preserved as a memorial to the First Transcontinental Railroad, starting with articles about local history that began in 1926. Anderson was president of the Golden Spike Association of Box Elder County, which held its first re-enactment of the joining of the rails on May 10, 1952, using local volunteers organized by Judge B.C. Call from a script written by Marie Thorne Jepson. Anderson tirelessly wrote to state and federal officials urging them to build a monument at Promontory Summit, and it was authorized as a National Historic Site on April 2, 1957, under non-federal ownership; at that time, the Golden Spike Association maintained the site under a cooperative agreement between the Southern Pacific Railroad and the state and federal governments.

It was authorized for federal ownership and administration by an act of Congress on July 30, 1965, as Golden Spike National Historic Site. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed into law March 12, 2019, redesignated it as a national historical park. Historic sites are typically a single building, while historical parks include multiple landmarks in a larger district.

28,000 visitors attended the centennial anniversary of the completion ceremony on May 10, 1969, including Bernice Gibbs Anderson. The Visitor Center had just been completed. On that day, the Virginia and Truckee locomotives nos. 11, &quot;Reno&quot;, and 12, &quot;Genoa&quot; were loaned from their respective owners, the Pacific Coast Chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society, and MGM Studios, redecorated to represent the Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Pacific &quot;Jupiter&quot;, respectively, and placed on a section of restored trackage to recreate the completion ceremony. That year, the railroad grade was named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The &quot;119&quot; (the V&amp;T &quot;Reno&quot;) was sold to Old Tucson Studios in Tucson, Arizona, and the &quot;Jupiter&quot; (the &quot;Genoa&quot;), was sold to the state of California, and the two engines were sent to their respective new owners the following year, the latter engine joining the rest of the former Pacific Coast Chapter RLHS-owned equipment in what ultimately became the California State Railroad Museum. Replacing the engines at Promontory were the Virginia and Truckee locomotives nos. 22, &quot;Inyo&quot;, and 18, &quot;Dayton&quot; redecorated as the &quot;Jupiter&quot; and &quot;No. 119&quot;, respectively. These engines remained at the site until 1978, when they were sent to the state of Nevada, which had purchased them in 1974, to be a part of what ultimately became the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City.

In 1978, a general master plan for the site was adopted with the goal of maintaining the site&#x27;s scenic attributes as closely as possible to its appearance and characteristics in 1869. The functioning replicas of the &quot;Jupiter&quot; and &quot;No. 119&quot; locomotives were brought to the site in time to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the joining of the rails in 1979.

In 2006, a petition to the Board on Geographic Names resulted in a name change for Chinaman&#x27;s Arch, a limestone arch at Golden Spike National Historical Park. Named Chinaman&#x27;s Arch in honor of the 19th century Chinese railroad workers, the arch was officially renamed in the same year as the Chinese Arch to mollify sensitivities about the original name.

On May 10, 2019, a 150th anniversary celebration was held in commemoration of the completion of the railroad. This event was attended by several notable local leaders, including Utah governor Gary Herbert and the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Russell M. Nelson.

<text>HMAS &quot;Dechaineux&quot; (SSG 76) is the fourth of six &quot;Collins&quot; class submarines operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Named for Captain Emile Dechaineux, the boat was laid down in 1993 and launched in 1998. &quot;Dechaineux&quot; and sister boat &quot;Sheean&quot; were modified during construction as part of the &quot;fast track&quot; program—an attempt to fix the problems affecting the &quot;Collins&quot; class, and put at least two fully operational submarines in service before the last &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarine was decommissioned.

In 2003, a seawater pipe burst while &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was submerged deep, nearly resulting in the loss of the submarine.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Collins&quot; class is an enlarged version of the &quot;Västergötland&quot;-class submarine designed by Kockums. At in length, with a beam of and a waterline depth of , displacing 3,051 tonnes when surfaced, and 3,353 tonnes when submerged, they are the largest conventionally powered submarines in the world. The hull is constructed from high-tensile micro-alloy steel, and are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar. The depth that they can dive to is classified: most sources claim that it is over ,

The submarine is armed with six torpedo tubes, and carry a standard payload of 22 torpedoes: originally a mix of Gould Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and UGM-84C Sub-Harpoon, with the Mark 48s later upgraded to the Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) version.

Each submarine is equipped with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400 kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The electricity generated is stored in batteries, then supplied to a single Jeumont-Schneider DC motor, which provides to a single, seven-bladed, diameter skewback propeller. The &quot;Collins&quot; class has a speed of when surfaced or at snorkel depth, and can reach underwater. The submarines have a range of at when surfaced, at at snorkel depth. When submerged completely, a &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine can travel at maximum speed, or at . Each boat has an endurance of 70 days.

The issues with the &quot;Collins&quot; class highlighted in the McIntosh-Prescott Report and the pressing need to have combat-ready submarines in the RAN fleet with the pending decommissioning of , the final &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarine in Australian service, prompted the establishment of an A$1 billion program to bring &quot;Dechaineux&quot; and sister boat &quot;Sheean&quot; up to an operational standard as quickly as possible, referred to as the &quot;fast track&quot; or &quot;get well&quot; program. The fast track program required the installation of reliable diesel engines, fixing hydrodynamic noise issues by modifying the hull design and propeller, and providing a functional combat system. The original Rockwell International-designed combat system had been cancelled, but because there wasn&#x27;t enough time to evaluate the replacement system to include it in the &quot;fast track&quot; program, the two submarines were fitted with components from the old Rockwell system, which were augmented by commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software. Even with the enhanced Rockwell system, it was believed that the capabilities of the fast track &quot;Collins&quot; boats was only equivalent to the &quot;Oberons&quot;.

&quot;Dechaineux&quot; was laid down by the Australian Submarine Corporation on 4 March 1993, launched on 12 March 1998, and commissioned into the RAN on 23 February 2001. &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was named for Captain Emile Dechaineux, who was killed by a kamikaze attack on 21 October 1944 while commanding .

==Operational history==
On 14 December 2000, &quot;Dechaineux&quot; and &quot;Sheean&quot; arrived at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;, following the completion of sea trials.

On 12 February 2003, &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was operating near her maximum safe diving depth off the coast of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented &quot;Dechaineux&quot; from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines to base after the incident, and after engineers were unable to determine the flaw in the pipes that caused the incident, instructed that the maximum safe depth of the class be reduced.

&quot;Dechaineux&quot; underwent a maintenance period during 2009 and early 2010; the submarine was returned to service in late May 2010.

On 9 November 2010, &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was damaged after a tugboat helping the submarine to manoeuvre from her berth at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot; crossed over the submarine&#x27;s stern. The submarine was sent to the Australian Marine Complex at Henderson, Western Australia for repairs: these were completed within a week, and &quot;Dechaineux&quot; was operational by late November.

During 2012, &quot;Dechaineux&quot; underwent an intermediate maintenance docking, assisted during trials of the MU90 Impact torpedo, and participated in several training exercises.

<text>HMAS &quot;Sheean&quot; (SSG 77) is the fifth of six &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

&quot;Sheean&quot; was named for Ordinary Seaman Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Sheean, who manned an Oerlikon and fired on Japanese aircraft attacking the bathurst-class corvette , dying when the ship sank. After his ship was damaged shortly in the fight, an abandon ship order was called. Teddy, realizing that the men in the water would be massacred by the incoming Japanese zeroes, manned an anti-aircraft gun, successfully downing 3 aircraft. Teddy was last seen still at his gun, continuously firing, even as he was pulled under, stilled strapped to his anti-aircraft gun. &quot;Sheean&quot; is the only submarine named after an enlisted sailor. The submarine was laid down by Australian Submarine Corporation, on 17 February 1994, launched on 1 May 1999 by Ivy Hayes, Teddy Sheean&#x27;s sister, and commissioned into the RAN on 23 February 2001.

==Operational history==

On 14 December 2000, &quot;Sheean&quot; and &quot;Dechaineux&quot; arrived at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;, following the completion of sea trials.

The submarine participated in RIMPAC 02, where &quot;Sheean&quot; was able to penetrate the air and surface anti-submarine screens of an eight-ship amphibious task force, then successfully attacked both the amphibious assault ship and the dock landing ship . During two weeks of combat trials in August 2002, &quot;Sheean&quot; demonstrated that the class was comparable in the underwater warfare role to the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class nuclear-powered attack submarine . The two submarines traded roles during the exercise and were equally successful in the attacking role, despite &quot;Olympia&quot; being larger, more powerful, and armed with more advanced torpedoes than &quot;Sheean&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Sheean&quot; was presented with the Gloucester Cup for being the RAN vessel with the greatest overall efficiency over the previous twelve months.

&quot;Sheean&quot; was docked for a long maintenance period in 2008, but workforce shortages and malfunctions on other submarines requiring urgent attention have drawn this out: RAN and ASC officials predicted in 2010 that she would not be back in service until 2012. The maintenance period ended in late 2012, and &quot;Sheean&quot; spent the rest of the year working back up to operational status. The submarine was formally returned to service on 23 February 2013.

On 16 July 2013, &quot;Sheean&quot; was damaged while berthed at the Australian Marine Complex. &quot;Combi Dock III&quot;, a cargo ship owned by Danish company Combi Lift and intended to supply the Gorgon gas project, broke free of moorings during a storm, and drifted into the submarine, causing damage to &quot;Sheean&quot;″s propeller and steering apparatus. &quot;Combi Dock III&quot; was impounded by the Australian government until 13 September, when Combi Lift agreed to pay for the damage.

On 21 September 2021 &quot;Sheean&quot; experienced an emergency during a training exercise when water entered via a pump and the automatic system that is intended to respond to such malfunctions failed. The crew were forced to rapidly bring the submarine to the surface. The &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; reported that there were concerns that the submarine&#x27;s crew had a poor safety culture, and that some members of the crew had requested transfers off the boat due to the trauma they experienced in the accident. The Navy stated that the submarine had experienced a &quot;minor flooding incident&quot; and had not been in danger of sinking, and that it returned to service within a few days of the accident.

<text>HMAS &quot;Rankin&quot; is the sixth and final submarine of the &quot;Collins&quot; class, which are operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Named for Lieutenant Commander Robert William Rankin, the boat was laid down in 1995, and commissioned into the RAN in March 2003, following major delays.

Early in her career, &quot;Rankin&quot; was the subject of a documentary series and a coffee table book. She was the first submarine since 1987 to be awarded the Gloucester Cup.

==Construction==
&quot;Rankin&quot; was laid down by Australian Submarine Corporation on 12 May 1995. The boat was launched on 7 November 2001. She was delivered to the RAN on 18 March 2003 and commissioned on 29 March 2003, 41 months behind schedule, after major delays in the completion and fitting out of the boat due to the diversion of resources to the &quot;fast track&quot; submarines and and repeated cannibalisation for parts to repair the other five &quot;Collins&quot;-class boats.

&quot;Rankin&quot; was named for Lieutenant Commander Robert William Rankin, who died when the ship he commanded, , engaged a force of five Japanese warships on 4 March 1942, to allow an Allied convoy to escape. The boat is nicknamed &quot;The Black Knight&quot;.

==Characteristics==

The &quot;Collins&quot; class is an enlarged version of the &quot;Västergötland&quot;-class submarine designed by Kockums. At in length, with a beam of and a waterline depth of , displacing 3,051 tonnes when surfaced, and 3,353 tonnes when submerged, they are the largest conventionally powered submarines in the world. The hull is constructed from high-tensile micro-alloy steel, and are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar. The depth that they can dive to is classified: most sources claim that it is over ,

The submarine is armed with six torpedo tubes, and carry a standard payload of 22 torpedoes: originally a mix of Gould Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and UGM-84C Sub-Harpoon, with the Mark 48s later upgraded to the Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) version.

Each submarine is equipped with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400 kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The electricity generated is stored in batteries, then supplied to a single Jeumont-Schneider DC motor, which provides 7,200 shaft horsepower to a single, seven-bladed, diameter skewback propeller. The &quot;Collins&quot; class has a speed of when surfaced and at snorkel depth, and can reach underwater. The submarines have a range of at when surfaced, at at snorkel depth. When submerged completely, a &quot;Collins&quot; class submarine can travel at maximum speed, or at . Each boat has a endurance of 70 days.

==Operational history==
During a multinational exercise in September 2003, which was attended by &quot;Rankin&quot; and sister boat &quot;Waller&quot;, &quot;Rankin&quot; successfully &quot;sank&quot; a Singaporean anti-submarine warfare vessel.
In 2004, a film crew was embarked aboard &quot;Rankin&quot; for the creation of &quot;Submariners&quot;, a six-part documentary aired by SBS in 2005 and depicting life aboard a submarine. The film crew was on board from February to April 2004, during which the boat completed pre-deployment trials, participated in the submarine rescue exercise Pacific Reach, and made a diplomatic visit to Kure, Japan. They later rejoined &quot;Rankin&quot; during the submarine&#x27;s deployment to Hawaii for RIMPAC 04 in June and July. Later that year, &quot;Rankin&quot; was also the subject of the book &quot;Beneath Southern Seas&quot;. The coffee table book, which encompasses the history of the Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service, was primarily based on photographs and interviews of &quot;Rankin&quot; and those aboard taken by the authors during a twelve-day voyage from Sydney to Fremantle, concluding the six-month deployment started during the filming of &quot;Submariners&quot;. The voyage—the longest undertaken by a &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine to that date—began with workups in February, and saw the submarine visit Korea, Japan, and Hawaii, and participate in various multinational exercises before returning to Fremantle via Sydney. &quot;Rankin&quot; was at sea for 126 days, 80% of which was spent underwater.

On 10 June 2005, &quot;Rankin&quot; was presented with the Gloucester Cup. Presented to the RAN vessel with the greatest overall efficiency over the previous twelve months, &quot;Rankin&quot; was the first &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine to earn the Cup, and the first submarine to receive it since in 1987. The award was again presented to &quot;Rankin&quot; in 2008.

&quot;Rankin&quot; was docked for a long maintenance period in 2008, but workforce shortages and malfunctions on other submarines requiring urgent attention have drawn this out: in 2010 RAN and ASC officials predicted that she would not be back in service until 2013. At the end of the works on &quot;Rankin&quot;, personnel were transferred from (which was commencing a similar period of maintenance and upgrades), and &quot;Rankin&quot; arrived at Fleet Base West on 1 October 2014.

<text>Irene Papas or Irene Pappas (, ; born Eirini Lelekou (); 3 September 1929 – 14 September 2022) was a Greek actress and singer who starred in over 70 films in a career spanning more than 50 years. She gained international recognition through such popular award-winning films as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964) and &quot;Z&quot; (1969). She was a powerful protagonist in films including &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; (1971) and &quot;Iphigenia&quot; (1977). She played the title roles in &quot;Antigone&quot; (1961) and &quot;Electra&quot; (1962). She had a fine singing voice, on display in the 1968 recording &quot;Songs of Theodorakis&quot;.

Papas won Best Actress awards at the Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;Antigone&quot; and from the National Board of Review for &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;. Her career awards include the Golden Arrow Award in 1993 at Hamptons International Film Festival, and the Golden Lion Award in 2009 at the Venice Biennale.

== Early life ==
Papas was born as Eirini Lelekou (Ειρήνη Λελέκου) on 3 September 1929, in the village of Chiliomodi, outside Corinth, Greece. Her mother, Eleni Prevezanou (Ελένη Πρεβεζάνου), was a schoolteacher, and her father, Stavros Lelekos (Σταύρος Λελέκος), taught classical drama at the Sofikós school in Corinth. She recalled that she was always acting as a child, making dolls out of rags and sticks; after a touring theatre visited the village performing Greek tragedies with the women tearing their hair, she used to tie a black scarf around her head and perform for the other children. The family moved to Athens when she was seven years old. She was educated from age 15 at the National Theatre of Greece Drama School in Athens, taking classes in dance and singing. She found the acting style advocated by the school old-fashioned, formal, and stylised, and rebelled against it, causing her to have to repeat a year; she eventually graduated in 1948.

== Career ==

=== Theatre ===

Papas began her acting career in Greece in variety and traditional theatre, in plays by Ibsen, Shakespeare, and classical Greek tragedy, before moving into film in 1951. She continued to appear on stage from time to time, including in New York City in productions such as Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;. She played in &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot; in Broadway&#x27;s Circle in the Square Theatre in 1968. 

She starred in &quot;Medea&quot; in 1973 on Broadway. Reviewing the production in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, drama critic Clive Barnes described her as a &quot;very fine, controlled Medea&quot;, smouldering with a &quot;carefully dampened passion&quot;, constantly fierce. 
Theatre critic Walter Kerr also praised the performance. Both saw in her portrayal what Barnes called an &quot;unrelenting determination and unwavering desire for justice&quot;. She appeared in &quot;The Bacchae&quot; in 1980 at Circle in the Square, and in &quot;Electra&quot; at the Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus in 1985.

=== Film ===

==== Europe ====
Papas was discovered by Elia Kazan in Greece, where she achieved widespread fame. Her first film work was a small part in Nikos Tsiforos&#x27;s 1948 &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (Greek, &quot;Hamenoi angeloi&quot;). She began to attract attention with her role in Frixos Iliadis&#x27;s 1952 film &quot;Dead City&quot; (Greek, &quot;Nekri Politeia&quot;). The film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, where Papas was welcomed by the international press, and photographed spending time with the wealthy Aga Khan. Greek filmmakers thought her a noncommercial actress, and she tried her hand abroad, signing with Lux Film in Italy, where the publicity for &quot;Dead City&quot; was enough to launch her as a film star. She played in Lux&#x27;s 1954 films &quot;Attila&quot; and &quot;Theodora, Slave Empress&quot;, which attracted Hollywood&#x27;s attention. Many other films followed, both in Greece and internationally.

She was a leading figure in cinematic transcriptions of ancient tragedy, playing the title roles in George Tzavellas&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; (1961) and Michael Cacoyannis&#x27;s &quot;Electra&quot; (1962), with her powerful portrayal of the doomed heroine; this brought her star status. She played Helen in Cacoyannis&#x27;s &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; (1971) opposite Katharine Hepburn, and Clytemnestra with &quot;smoldering eyes&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in his &quot;Iphigenia&quot; (1977).

Papas became fluent in Italian, and many of her films were made in that language. She said Cacoyannis was the only director that she was really comfortable with, describing herself as &quot;too obedient&quot; to stand up to other directors. Cacoyannis said that she was part of his decision to make &quot;Iphigenia&quot;, forming his image of Clytemnestra with her power and physique, and her un-selfpitying, impersonal anger against the injustice of life, something that in his view was accessible to actors from countries like Greece that had experienced long years of oppression.

Alejandro Valverde García described Papas&#x27;s part in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; as &quot;the most convincing cinematographic Helen that has ever been represented&quot;, noting that the script was written with her in mind.

==== Hollywood ====
Papas debuted in American film with a bit part in the B-movie &quot;The Man from Cairo&quot; (1953); her next American film was a much larger role as Jocasta Constantine, with James Cagney, in the Western &quot;Tribute to a Bad Man&quot; (1956). She then starred in films such as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961) and Cacoyannis&#x27;s &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964), based on Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27;s novel of the same name, set to Mikis Theodorakis&#x27;s music, establishing her reputation internationally.

In &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, she stars as a resistance fighter involved in the action, an addition to Alistair Maclean&#x27;s novel, providing a love interest and a strong female character. Gerasimus Katsan comments that she plays a &quot;hard as nails&quot; partisan in &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, &quot;capable, unafraid, stoic, patriotic, and heroic&quot;; when the men hesitate, she kills the traitorous Anna; but although she interacts romantically with Andreas (Anthony Quinn), she remains &quot;cool and rational&quot;, revealing little of her sensual persona; she is as tough as the men, like the stereotype of a Greek village woman, but she is contrasted with them in the film.

Bosley Crowther called her appearance in &quot;Zorba&quot; &quot;dark and intense as the widow&quot;. Katsan said that she was most often remembered as the &quot;sensual widow&quot; in &quot;Zorba&quot;. Katsan wrote that she was again contrasted to the other village women, playing &quot;the beautiful and tortured widow&quot; who is eventually hunted to death with what Vrasidas Karalis called &quot;elemental nobility&quot;. The scholar of film Jefferson Hunter wrote that Papas helped lift &quot;Zorba&quot; from being merely an &quot;exuberant&quot; film with the stark passion of her subplot role.

This success did not earn her an easy life; she stated that she did not work for 2 years after &quot;Electra&quot;, despite the prizes and acclamation; and again, she was out of work for 18 months after &quot;Zorba&quot;. It turned out to be her most popular film, but she said she earned only $10,000 from it.

Papas played leading roles in several critically acclaimed films. In &quot;Z&quot; (1969), her political activist&#x27;s widow has been called &quot;indelible&quot;. She played an admired Catherine of Aragon in &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;, opposite Richard Burton and Geneviève Bujold in 1969. In 1976, she starred in &quot;The Message&quot; about the origin of Islam, a film which Mark Cousins stated was &quot;perhaps seen by as many people as...any film in cinema history.&quot; In 1982, she appeared in &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot;. One of her last film appearances was in &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; in 2001, where in Katsan&#x27;s view she was underused reprising her strong peasant woman from &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; and the widow from &quot;Zorba&quot;.

==== Stardom ====
The &quot;Enciclopedia Italiana&quot; described Papas as a typical Mediterranean beauty, with a lovely voice both in singing and acting, greatly talented and with an adventurous spirit. Olga Kourelou added that film-makers from Cacoyannis onwards have made systematic use of her looks: &quot;Her chalk-white skin and long black hair, dark brown eyes, thick arched eyebrows, and straight nose make Papas appear as the quintessential idea of Greek beauty.&quot; She writes that the camera has lingered in close-up on Papas&#x27;s face, and that she is often photographed in profile, intentionally recalling the iconography of ancient Greece. Kourelou gives as example the profile shot in &quot;Iphigenia&quot; where Papas sings a lullaby to her daughter, in front of a Hellenic sculpture of a woman, the shot bringing out the resemblance of their facial features; she notes that posters of Papas have often used the same motif.

Gerasimus Katsan wrote that she is the best-known and most recognisable Greek film star, &quot;an actor with incredible range, power, and subtlety&quot;. In the view of the film critic Philip Kemp,

Kemp described Papas as an awe-inspiring presence, which paradoxically limited her career. He admired her roles in Cacoyannis&#x27;s films, including the defiant Helen of Troy in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;; the vengeful, grief-stricken Clytemnestra in &quot;Iphigenia&quot;; and &quot;memorably&quot; as the cool but sensual widow in &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;. David Thomson, in his &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot;, called Papas&#x27;s manner in &quot;Iphigenia&quot; &quot;blatant declaiming&quot;. She stood out in Costa-Gavras&#x27;s 1968 political film &quot;Z&quot;, based on a real-life assassination, and in Ruy Guerra&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Eréndira&quot;, with a screenplay by the novelist Gabriel García Márquez.

The film critic Roger Ebert observed that there were many &quot;pretty girls&quot; in cinema &quot;but not many women&quot;, and called Papas a great actress. Ebert noted her uphill struggle, her height, limiting the leading men she could play alongside, her accent limiting the roles she could take, and that &quot;her unusual beauty is not the sort that superstar actresses like to compete with.&quot; Ordinary actors, he suggested, had trouble sharing the screen with Papas. All the same, her presence in many well-known movies, wrote Ebert, inspired &quot;something of a cult&quot;.

In his book on Greek cinema, Mel Schuster called Papas a great actress on the strength of her roles in four of Cacoyannis&#x27;s films. He found her stage presence awe-inspiring, especially in &quot;Electra&quot;, and so powerful as to limit the film roles she could take, as she seemed to be an elemental force of nature. That resulted, Schuster stated, in Hollywood&#x27;s treating her as &quot;a Mother Earth who suffered and survived, but rarely talked or acted&quot;. That made her Helen in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, pacing up and down like a caged panther &quot;with just the searching eyes darting through the bars&quot;, a &quot;marvelous surprise&quot;, as Hollywood saw that in fact she was also an accomplished actor. In his view, casting her as the beautiful Helen was daring, as Papas was not, in 1971, as conventionally beautiful as a Hedy Lamarr or an Elizabeth Taylor; if she was the face that launched a thousand ships, then she brought &quot;a force which might indeed have inspired a holocaust&quot;. Schuster commented that in each of the four Cacoyannis films, one shot of Papas&#x27;s gave &quot;indelible pleasure&quot; and remained etched in the memory. In &quot;Iphigenia&quot;, that shot was in his view wisely placed at the end, under the closing credits, so that viewers see her until that moment as a versatile and powerfully histrionic actress, appropriate both to the ancient mythic dimensions of the tale and to a modern psychological reading of the myth.

Bella Vivante contrasted Papas&#x27;s dark-haired Helen in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; with the conventional choice of a blonde, Rossana Podestà, in Robert Wise&#x27;s 1956 &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;. Where Wise emphasised Helen&#x27;s seductive gaze and framed Podesta as an ideal beauty for the audience to look at, Cacoyannis made the scenes framed as Papas&#x27;s gaze provide &quot;an empowering female identity&quot;.

The scholar of Greek, Gerasimus Katsan, called her the most recognizable and best-known Greek film star, with &quot;range, power, and subtlety&quot;, stating that her work made her a kind of national hero. She acted strong women with &quot;beauty and sensuality, but also fierce independence and spirit&quot;.

Robert Stam wrote of Papas&#x27;s role in Ruy Guerra&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Eréndira&quot; that &quot;the near-indestructible grandmother [of the eponymous young prostitute] reigns supreme&quot;; she gives the effect of &quot;a kind of queen&quot; both through the regal props and her powerful performance, at once villainous and sympathetic, &quot;an oracle who speaks truths, especially about men and love&quot;.

Kourelou wrote that although Papas had appeared in the films of both European and American &quot;auteurs&quot;, she was best known as a &quot;tragedienne&quot;, citing the film-maker Manoel de Oliveira&#x27;s remark that &quot;this great tragedienne is the grand and beautiful image that embodies the deepest essence of the female soul. She is the image of Greece of all time ..., the mother of western civilisation&quot;. In Kourelou&#x27;s view, Papas&#x27;s tragic persona &quot;offers an image of sublimated beauty with a transcendental quality&quot;; she notes that Papas is neither &quot;sexualised nor glamorised&quot; with the single exception of her role as Helen in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;.

In 1973, she was honoured with a photo shoot by the Magnum photographer Ferdinando Scianna.

Asked about her acting for film and stage, and in classical and modern films, Papas stated that the acting techniques and method of expressing oneself are the same. One might, she said, need to use a louder voice on a classical stage, but &quot;you always use the same soul&quot;. She denied having any secret to acting with such energy, but said that one&#x27;s attitude to death was what drove action. Death was in her view &quot;the greatest catalyst in human life&quot;; while waiting to die, one had to decide what to do with one&#x27;s life.

=== Singing ===
In 1969, the RCA label released Papas&#x27; vinyl LP &quot;Songs of Theodorakis&quot; (INTS 1033). This has 11 songs sung in Greek, conducted by Harry Lemonopoulos and produced by Andy Wiswell, with sleeve notes in English by Michael Cacoyannis. It was released on CD in 2005 (FM 1680). Papas knew Mikis Theodorakis from working with him on &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; as early as 1964. The critic Clive Barnes said of her singing performance on the album that &quot;Irene Pappas is known to the public as an actress, but that is why she sings with such intensity, her very appearance, with her raven hair, is an equally dynamic means of expression&quot;.

In 1972, she appeared on the album &quot;666&quot; by the Greek rock group Aphrodite&#x27;s Child on the track &quot;∞&quot; (&quot;infinity&quot;). She chants &quot;I was, I am, I am to come&quot; repeatedly and wildly over a percussive backing, worrying the label, Mercury, who hesitated over releasing the album, causing controversy with her &quot;graphic orgasm&quot;.

In 1979, Polydor released her album of eight Greek folk songs entitled &quot;Odes&quot;, with electronic music performed (and partly composed) by Vangelis. The lyrics were co-written by Arianna Stassinopoulos. They collaborated again in 1986 for &quot;Rapsodies&quot;, an electronic rendition of seven Byzantine liturgy hymns, also on Polydor; Jonny Trunk wrote that there was &quot;no doubting the power, fire and earthy delights of Papas&#x27; voice&quot;.

== Politics ==

In 1967, Papas, a lifelong liberal, called for a &quot;cultural boycott&quot; against the &quot;Fourth Reich&quot;, meaning the military government of Greece at that time. Her opposition to the regime sent her, and other artists such as Mikis Theodorakis, whose songs she sang, into exile when the military junta came to power in Greece in 1967; she moved into temporary exile in Italy and New York. When the junta fell in 1974, she returned to Greece, spending time both in Athens and in her family&#x27;s village house in Chiliomodi as well as continuing to work in Rome.

== Personal life ==
In 1947, she married the film director Alkis Papas; they divorced in 1951.
In 1954, she met the actor Marlon Brando, and they had a long love affair, which they kept secret at the time. Fifty years later, when Brando died, she recalled that &quot;I have never since loved a man as I loved Marlon. He was the great passion of my life, absolutely the man I cared about the most and also the one I esteemed most, two things that generally are difficult to reconcile&quot;. 
Her second marriage was to the film producer José Kohn in 1957; that marriage was later annulled. She was the aunt of the film director Manousos Manousakis and the actor Aias Manthopoulos.

In 2003 she served on the board of directors of the Anna-Marie Foundation, a fund which provided assistance to people in rural areas of Greece. In 2013 she began to suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Papas spent her final years in home care at her niece&#x27;s house in Kifissia. She died there on 14 September 2022, at the age of 93, and was interred at the Chiliomodi Cemetery, Corinthia.

<text>Greil Marcus (né Gerstley; born June 19, 1945) is an American author, music journalist and cultural critic. He is notable for producing scholarly and literary essays that place rock music in a broader framework of culture and politics.

== Biography ==
Marcus was born Greil Gerstley in San Francisco, California, the only son of Greil Gerstley and Eleanor Gerstley (&quot;née&quot; Hyman). Marcus is Jewish. His father, a naval officer, died in December 1944, when a Philippine typhoon sank the USS &quot;Hull&quot;, on which he was serving as second-in-command. Admiral William Halsey had ordered the U.S. Third Fleet to sail into Typhoon Cobra &quot;to see what they were made of,&quot; and, despite the crew&#x27;s urging, Gerstley refused to disobey the order, arguing that there had never been a mutiny in the history of the U.S. Navy and that &quot;somebody had to die&quot;. The incident inspired the novel &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;. Eleanor Gerstley was three months pregnant when her husband died. In 1948, she married Gerald Marcus, who adopted her son and gave the boy his surname. Greil Marcus has several half-siblings.

His wife is Jennelle Marcus (&quot;née&quot; Berstein).

Marcus earned an undergraduate degree in American studies from the University of California, Berkeley, where he also undertook graduate studies in political science. He often cited as a major influence a Berkeley political science professor, Michael Rogin, of whom he said: &quot;That course had more to do with putting me on the path I&#x27;ve followed ever since, for good or ill, than anything else.&quot;

He has been a rock critic and columnist for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (where he was the first reviews editor) and other publications, including &quot;Creem&quot;, the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Artforum&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. From 1983 to 1989, he was on the board of directors of the National Book Critics Circle. Since 1966 he has been married to Jenny Marcus, with whom he has two daughters. Marcus&#x27; daughter Emily died on January 31, 2023 of cancer.

His book &quot;Mystery Train&quot; (published in 1975 and in its sixth revised and updated edition in 2015) is notable for placing rock and roll in the context of American cultural archetypes, from &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; to &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to Stagger Lee. Marcus&#x27;s &quot;recognition of the unities in the American imagination that already exist&quot; inspired countless rock journalists. On August 30, 2011, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a list of its selection of the 100 best nonfiction books since 1923, when the magazine was first published; &quot;Mystery Train&quot; was on the list, one of only five books dealing with culture and the only one on the subject of American music. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Dwight Garner said, &quot;&quot;Mystery Train&quot; is among the few works of criticism that can move me to something close to tears. It reverberated in my young mind like the E major chord that ends the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot;

His next book, &quot;Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century&quot; (1989), stretched his trademark riffing across a century of Western civilization. Positing punk rock as a transhistorical cultural phenomenon, Marcus examined philosophical connections between subjects as diverse as medieval heretics, Dada, the Situationists, and the Sex Pistols.

Marcus published &quot;Dead Elvis&quot;, a collection of writings about Elvis Presley, in 1991, and &quot;Ranters and Crowd Pleasers&quot; (reissued as &quot;In the Fascist Bathroom: Punk in Pop Music&quot;), an examination of post-punk political pop, in 1993.

Using bootleg recordings of Bob Dylan as a starting point, he dissected the American subconscious in &quot;Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan&#x27;s Basement Tapes&quot;, published in 1997.

He writes the column &quot;Elephant Dancing&quot; for &quot;Interview&quot; and &quot;Real Life Rock Top Ten&quot; for &quot;The Believer&quot;. He occasionally teaches graduate courses in American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and teaches a lecture class, &quot;The Old Weird America: Music as Democratic Speech – From the Commonplace Song to Bob Dylan&quot;, at the New School. During the fall of 2008, he held the Winton Chair in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, where he taught and lectured on the history of American pop culture.

His book &quot;When That Rough God Goes Riding: Listening to Van Morrison&quot; was published in March 2010. It focuses on &quot;Marcus&#x27;s quest to understand Van Morrison&#x27;s particular genius through the extraordinary and unclassifiable moments in his long career&quot;. The title is derived from Morrison&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Rough God Goes Riding&quot;.

He subsequently published &quot;Bob Dylan by Greil Marcus: Writings 1968–2010&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Doors: A Lifetime of Listening to Five Mean Years&quot; (2011).

<text>USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; (CGN-40), a nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 20th state admitted to the Union. Her keel was laid down by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Newport News, Virginia, on 22 February 1975. She was launched on 31 July 1976. The ship was commissioned on 5 August 1978 by Jimmy Carter, then serving as the 39th president of the United States. Early deployment included escorting the carrier . She also was deployed in 1989 as a response to the capture and subsequent murder of U.S. Marine Corps Colonel William R. Higgins by terrorists.

==Ship history==
&quot;Mississippi&quot; (DLGN 40) was laid down on 22 February 1975 at Newport News, Virginia, by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.; reclassified as a guided missile cruiser and designated CGN 40 on 30 June 1975; launched on 31 July 1976; sponsored by Miss. Janet H. Finch, daughter of Governor Charles C. Finch of Mississippi; and, in ceremonies attended by President James E. [Jimmy] Carter, Jr., Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, and Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi, was commissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 August 1978.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; conducted her shakedown cruise to Caribbean and South American waters (8 January–13 February 1979), then made her first deployment—to the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean – (3 August 1981 – 12 February 1982) during a confrontation between the United States and Libya. She operated as part of the screen for aircraft carriers and during the Gulf of Sidra incident. &quot;Mississippi&quot; fired three RIM-66B Standard SM-1 surface-to-air missiles during a live-fire exercise.

While &quot;Mississippi&quot; steamed with &quot;Nimitz&quot; and guided missile cruiser off the coast of Lebanon, she received a distress call from Greek cargo vessel &quot;Andalusia&quot;, at 00:30 on 3 December 1982). Crew 11, a Lockheed P-3C Orion from VP-49, vectored &quot;Mississippi&quot; to &quot;Andalusia&quot; and the cruiser rescued all 19 crewmembers. Two Sikorsky Sea Kings from HS-9 operating from &quot;Nimitz&quot; transferred survivors from &quot;Mississippi&quot; to the carrier. &quot;Mississippi&quot;″s chief engineer and damage control assistant inspected &quot;Andalusia&quot; but determined that her damage precluded salvage, and the ship sank at 08:24, 1,200 yards off the port bow of the cruiser in 195 fathoms (36°1&#x27;N, 12°19&#x27;2&quot;E).

On 1 August 1989 Arab terrorists in Beirut, Lebanon, kidnapped and hanged Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, USMC, a member of the UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, and threatened to murder additional hostages they held. The carrier departed early from a visit to Singapore and made for the Arabian Sea, and steamed from Alexandria, Egypt, to the Eastern Mediterranean as a show of force. &quot;Mississippi&quot; had deployed as part of the Sixth Fleet&#x27;s Med 3–89 Battle Force and was visiting Haifa, Israel, when the crisis began. She emergency sortied and operated as the battle group&#x27;s Composite Warfare Coordinator for anti-surface warfare off the Lebanese littoral throughout the remainder of the month. had originally been scheduled to participate in Pacific Exercise-89, but sailed to fill a carrier commitment in the Indian Ocean, where she operated until mid-October.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; deployed with the Battle Group to the Mediterranean for Operations Desert Shield/Storm (16 August 1990 – 28 March 1991). She escorted the carrier , which broke with her conventionally fueled battle group upon exiting the Suez Canal. These two ships travelled at flank speed the length of the Red Sea and through the Bab-el-Mandeb into the Gulf of Aden arriving on (15 January). The importance of that day and break-neck speed to arrive on it was due to uncertainty about Yemen&#x27;s position on the war, getting the carrier beyond shore batteries and short range patrol boats in the narrow straights was a priority before hostilities could commence on (16 January). &quot;Mississippi&quot; then waited off the coast of Yemen to escort the engine room troubled through the Bab-el-Mandeb (18 January) and out beyond the Gulf of Aden. As an ammunition ship, &quot;Nitro&quot; was needed for battleship shore battery and amphibious landing support. Once escort duty was complete &quot;Mississippi&quot; made flank speed to her launch position in the northern Red Sea. &quot;Mississippi&quot; fired three BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) at Iraqi strategic and military targets (25 January 1991) and two more the following day. One Tomahawk failed after launch and landed in the sea after a short erratic flight. The ship then operated as the local anti-air warfare screen commander for the Red Sea Battle Force (27 January – 24 February).

Following the Haitian Army&#x27;s overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide (September 1991), a succession of governments led to sectarian violence. The UN authorized force to restore order and the U.S. initiated Operations Support Democracy and Uphold/Restore Democracy—Uphold Democracy for a peaceful entry into Haiti, and &quot;Restore Democracy&quot; in the event of resistance. &quot;Mississippi&quot; enforced the embargoes imposed upon Haiti as part of &quot;Support Democracy&quot; (14 July – 3 August). The deteriorating situation then (12 September 1994) prompted the dispatch of a multinational force that included the carriers &quot;America&quot; and —about 1,800 soldiers of the Army&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps embarked on board &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;. The Haitians agreed to allow the Americans to land peacefully, and (31 March 1995) the U.S. transferred peacekeeping functions to international forces. The crisis marked the first deployment operationally of Army helicopters on board a carrier in lieu of most of an air wing.

NATO and the UN carried out Operations: Provide Promise to provide humanitarian relief for people displaced by the fighting in former Yugoslavia (2 July 1992 – 9 January 1996); Deny Flight to monitor the air space over Bosnia-Herzegovina to prevent the warring parties from using their air strength (12 April 1993 – 21 December 1995); and Sharp Guard to enforce the arms embargo against the combatants (15 June 1993 – 2 October 1996). &quot;Mississippi&quot; served as Red Crown—coordinating air operations—in the Maverick Operating Area in the Adriatic Sea (2–18 April, 14–21 May, 11–21 June, 30 June – 9 July, 22–27 July, and 22 August–6 September 1995). In addition, the cruiser intercepted Polish vessel &quot;Dajti&quot;, and her boarding team boarded and inspected the Eastern European ship as a possible smuggler (7 April).

Two Cuban Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29UB Fulcrums shot down two Cessna 337 Skymasters flown by the &quot;Brothers to the Rescue,&quot; a non-profit organization opposed to the Cuban government of Fidel Castro, over contested international waters (24 February 1996). &quot;Mississippi&quot; led a surface action group that included guided missile cruiser and guided missile frigate during Operations Sentinel Lifeguard, Standoff IV, and Escort 1–96 in the Straits of Florida in response to the Cubans&#x27; downing the Skymasters (25–28 February and 1–7 March). In addition, the group escorted a civilian flotilla that laid a wreath on the water where the victims fell.

==Decommissioning==
By 1995 it was determined her nuclear reactors would need to be refueled, but cuts in the Navy budget ruled out the refueling overhaul the ship would need to continue in service. After serving just 18 years in commissioned service, &quot;Mississippi&quot; was deactivated on 6 September 1996 at Norfolk and was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 July 1997. The ship was prepared and then towed from Norfolk, Virginia, to Bremerton, Washington, via the Panama Canal from March 1998 to May 1998. The Military Sealift Command fleet tug executed the initial tow until the decommissioned cruiser was moored at Rodman Naval Station, Panama. The Pacific tow was completed by to the Naval Sea Systems Command Inactive Ships Onsite Maintenance Office, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program around October 2004 and recycling was completed 30 November 2007.

In 2003, the ship&#x27;s main mast was installed at the Vietnam Veteran&#x27;s Memorial in Ocean Springs, Mississippi.

<text>The third USS &quot;Northampton&quot; (CLC-1/CC-1) was a US Navy command light cruiser (command ship). She was laid down as an heavy cruiser (CA–125), on 31 August 1944 by the Fore River Yard, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Quincy, Massachusetts. Work suspended between 11 August 1945 and 1 July 1948; she was converted to a command cruiser under project SCB 13 and launched as CLC–1, on 27 January 1951; sponsored by Mrs. Edmond J. Lampron; and commissioned as CLC–1, on 7 March 1953.

== History ==
Following shakedown, &quot;Northampton&quot; reported for duty to Commander Operational Development Forces, Atlantic Fleet. For seven months she conducted extensive tests of her new equipment. Evaluation completed in September 1954 and she reverted to the operational control of Commander Battleship Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet. She next demonstrated her capabilities as a tactical Command Ship by serving as flagship, first for Commander Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet (October–November 1954) and then for Commander 6th Fleet (December 1954–March 1955). Between 1 September and 22 October she served as flagship for Commander Strike Force, Atlantic, a position she was to hold frequently over the next fifteen years.

On 24 February 1956, &quot;Northampton&quot; emerged from her first overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, and, after refresher training off Cuba, participated as a unit of the Navy’s first guided missile division afloat, CruDiv 6, in the first public demonstration of the Terrier missile. In April, she steamed east for six months with the 6th Fleet, and, during the summer of 1957, resumed midshipmen training cruises. However, between that time and 1961, she infrequently returned to European waters. Deployed on occasion for NATO and fleet exercises and People to People visits, the command ship was visited by high government officials of various European countries, including Kings Baudouin of Belgium and Olav V of Norway.

== Decommissioning ==
Redesignated CC–1 on 15 April 1961, &quot;Northampton&quot; remained in the western Atlantic until decommissioning in February 1970. Her cruises ranged from Canadian to Panamanian waters as she extensively tested and evaluated new communications equipment and played host to visiting national and international dignitaries, including Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The ship was eventually withdrawn from service, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 December 1977 during the Carter Administration.

The ship&#x27;s bell is preserved at the war memorial in front of Memorial Hall, in the ship&#x27;s namesake city of Northampton, Massachusetts.

==Other roles==
Besides acting as a fleet command ship, &quot;Northampton&quot; was planned for or actually functioned in at least two other roles.

===Pilotfish===
When the first supercarrier USS &quot;United States&quot; (CVA-58) was being designed, it was thought she would not be able to have an island or masts for radar or other antennas. Therefore the &quot;Northampton&quot; was seen as a &#x27;pilotfish&#x27;, a ship that would escort the carrier and act not only as a radar picket (although from the center of the task force rather than the periphery as a true picket would), but also as the radar director of aircraft approach and landing on the carrier. The recent invention of the angled flight deck made it possible to install islands and radar on supercarriers, and so this role was eliminated from the &quot;Northampton&quot;.

===&quot;Floating White House&quot;===

According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article on 29 July 2006, &quot;Northampton&quot; was part of the U.S. government&#x27;s plan for Continuity of Operations and reported to be a &quot;floating White House&quot; to which the President could be evacuated in the event of nuclear attack. As such she was designated as the National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA); &quot;Northampton&quot; was one of two ships to serve in the role, with the other being the aircraft carrier . The ship was modified with an extra deck, the tallest communications mast in the Navy and multi-link communications gear.

<text>Damhnait Doyle (; born December 9, 1975) is a Canadian singer, composer and radio host. A phonetic spelling of her first name (which is Irish) also serves as the title of her 2003 album. She was a member of Atlantic Canadian band Shaye from 2003–2009 with Kim Stockwood and Tara MacLean (2003–2007). Along with Blake Manning, Stuart Cameron and Peter Fusco, she formed a new band called The Heartbroken; they have been active since 2009.

==Career==
Doyle took singing, guitar and clarinet lessons as a child, and released her debut album, &quot;Shadows Wake Me&quot;, in 1996. The lead single was &quot;A List of Things&quot;, and the album garnered a Juno Award nomination and several East Coast Music Award nominations for Doyle. She toured Canada with Steve Earle in support of his album &quot;I Feel Alright&quot;.

In 2000, Doyle released her follow-up album, &quot;Hyperdramatic&quot; which included the single &quot;Tattooed&quot;, &quot;Never Too Late&quot;, directed by Rob Heydon was nominated for Video of the Year at the East Coast Music Awards. In 2001, Doyle won four ECMA&#x27;s, including Video of the Year and Female Artist of the Year.

In 2003, Doyle&#x27;s third album, &quot;Davnet&quot;, was released. The CD was produced and co-written by Gordie Sampson at Lakewind Sound Studios, his Cape Breton recording studio. The first single was &quot;Another California Song&quot;, written by Doyle and Sampson. The video featured Doyle&#x27;s Shaye bandmates Kim Stockwood and Tara MacLean. A video was also released for &quot;Traffic&quot;.

In Christmas of that year, she went to Kabul, Afghanistan, to sing for the Canadian troops there, on the Christmas special &quot;Rick Mercer&#x27;s Christmas in Kabul&quot;.

She has worked with Alexz Johnson, co-writing two songs on &quot;Songs from Instant Star&quot;, then four on &quot;Songs from Instant Star Two&quot;. She recorded two songs on &quot;Songs from Instant Star 3&quot;: &quot;Just the Beginning&quot; as well as &quot;Darkness Round The Sun&quot; and two songs on &quot;Songs from Instant Star 4&quot;: &quot;The Music&quot; and &quot;I Still Love You&quot;. The song &quot;Say What You Will&quot; was featured in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Bitterest Pill&quot;, where the school held a memorial for a J.T. Yorke, who was fatally stabbed in the prior episode.

She did a duet with Rex Goudie on his album &quot;Look Closer&quot;, on the song &quot;Like I Was Dying&quot;, which she also co-wrote.

In 2008, Doyle lent her voice to the title sequence of &quot;&quot;, but her version of the theme was only used for the eighth season.

In 2009, Doyle, along with Blake Manning, Stuart Cameron and Peter Fusco, formed a new band called The Heartbroken. They released their debut album &quot;Tonight Tonight&quot; in June 2010. In September 2016, they released their follow up recording, Storm Clouds.

Doyle wrote a song for a play her father Clar Doyle wrote for EDFNL, titled the same as the play: &quot;Are You Watching Me Now?&quot;.

In April 2019, Doyle released her solo album, &quot;Liquor Store Flowers&quot;.

In June 2020, she co-hosted the Juno Awards of 2020 alongside Odario Williams. She is the host of &quot;Mornings&quot; on the CBC Music radio network.

In April 2021, Doyle sang the song &quot;Sleeping in the Cold Below&quot;, a stylised sea shanty, for inclusion in the game &quot;Warframe&quot;&quot;s &quot;Call Of The Tempestarii&quot; update.

<text>Shaye was a Canadian pop group, consisting of singer-songwriters Kim Stockwood, Damhnait Doyle and Tara MacLean. MacLean left the group in 2007 and the band folded by 2009. The band is named after MacLean&#x27;s sister who died in a car accident in 2002.

==Biography==
===&quot;The Bridge&quot;===
Shaye&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Bridge&quot; (produced by Bill Bell and Jay Joyce) was released in 2003 on EMI Canada. The album features songs by Ron Hynes, Sinéad Lohan and Crash Vegas. Support for the album included shows in Canada and Japan. &quot;Happy Baby&quot;, the lead single, was nominated for Single of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards. At the 2004 Canadian Radio Music Awards the group was named Best New Group in the mainstream adult contemporary radio category. Another single, &quot;Beauty&quot;, followed in January 2005.

===&quot;Lake of Fire&quot;===
Their 2006 followup, &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; was released on EMI Canada. It was exclusively available on iTunes in November 2006, then released physically as a cardboard Digipak in February 2007. It was produced by Jay Joyce (Patty Griffin, Tim Finn, Chantal Kreviazuk) and features songs by Van Morrison, Mike Scott of The Waterboys and Ron Sexsmith. Two singles were released from the album and the band toured Canada opening for Willie Nelson.

===Disbanding===
On October 8, 2007, Tara MacLean announced that she was leaving the trio.

After MacLean&#x27;s departure, Stockwood and Doyle announced on their website they would continue making music together as &quot;Shaye&quot;. In 2009 Shaye&#x27;s official website was redirected to MySpace where it was announced the band was officially no longer together. Kim Stockwood and Damhnait Doyle thanked their fans for all of their support.

===Solo careers===
In 2009, Damhnait Doyle, along with Blake Manning, Stuart Cameron and Peter Fusco, formed a new band called The Heartbroken. They released their debut album Tonight Tonight in June 2010. In September 2016, they released their follow up recording, Storm Clouds.[5] Doyle most recently released her solo album, &quot;Liquor Store Flowers&quot; in April 2019.

In March 2011, Stockwood released her fourth studio album Back to the Water. It includes performances with fellow Shaye band member Damhnait Doyle, and Newfoundland bands The Once and The Dardanelles. The album won the East Coast Music Association Award for traditional recording of the year in 2011. CMT aired a TV special about Stockwood, also entitled Back to the Water, in March 2011.

On 20 October 2017, Stockwood released an EP featuring Bill King on piano entitled Sometimes The Moon. This project features six cover songs including the title track by her deceased mentor Ron Hynes.

Tara MacLean&#x27;s fourth studio album Atlantic Blue was released on 22 May 2017 to project supporters on PledgeMusic on digital, CD and vinyl. As part of the promotion of the project, an EP called Evidence was released on NoiseTrade as a free download (donation optional), which featured a mix of released and previously unreleased tracks.

Atlantic Blue is a show and an album celebrating of Canadian east coast songwriters and contains covers of songs by Gene MacLellan, Gordie Sampson, Hank Snow, Lennie Gallant, The Rankin Family, Rita MacNeil, Ron Hynes, Sarah McLachlan, Shaye, Stan Rogers and Stompin’ Tom Connors.

<doc id="436166" wikidata="Q705396" url="?curid=436166" title="Variable-frequency oscillator">
<text>A variable frequency oscillator (VFO) in electronics is an oscillator whose frequency can be tuned (i.e., varied) over some range. It is a necessary component in any tunable radio transmitter and in receivers that work by the superheterodyne principle. The oscillator controls the frequency to which the apparatus is tuned.

==Purpose==
In a simple superheterodyne receiver, the incoming radio frequency signal (at frequency formula_1) from the antenna is &quot;mixed&quot; with the VFO output signal tuned to formula_2, producing an intermediate frequency (IF) signal that can be processed downstream to extract the modulated information. Depending on the receiver design, the IF signal frequency is chosen to be either the sum of the two frequencies at the mixer inputs (up-conversion), formula_3 or more commonly, the difference frequency (down-conversion), formula_4.

In addition to the desired &quot;IF&quot; signal and its unwanted image (the mixing product of opposite sign above), the mixer output will also contain the two original frequencies, formula_1 and formula_2 and various harmonic combinations of the input signals. These undesired signals are rejected by the IF filter. If a double balanced mixer is employed, the input signals appearing at the mixer outputs are greatly attenuated, reducing the required complexity of the IF filter.

The advantage of using a VFO as a heterodyning oscillator is that only a small portion of the radio receiver (the sections before the mixer such as the preamplifier) need to have a wide bandwidth. The rest of the receiver can be finely tuned to the IF frequency.

In a direct-conversion receiver, the VFO is tuned to the same frequency as the incoming radio frequency and formula_7 Hz. Demodulation takes place at baseband using low-pass filters and amplifiers.

In a radio frequency (RF) transmitter, VFOs are often used to tune the frequency of the output signal, often indirectly through a heterodyning process similar to that described above. Other uses include chirp generators for radar systems where the VFO is swept rapidly through a range of frequencies, timing signal generation for oscilloscopes and time domain reflectometers, and variable frequency audio generators used in musical instruments and audio test equipment.

==Types==
There are two main types of VFO in use: analog and digital.

===Analog VFOs===
An analog VFO is an electronic oscillator where the value of at least one of the passive components is adjustable under user control so as to alter its output frequency.
The passive component whose value is adjustable is usually a capacitor, but could be a variable inductor.

====Tuning capacitor====
The variable capacitor is a mechanical device in which the separation of a series of interleaved metal plates is physically altered to vary its capacitance. Adjustment of this capacitor is sometimes facilitated by a mechanical step-down gearbox to achieve fine tuning.

====Varactor====
A reversed-biased semiconductor diode exhibits capacitance. Since the width of its non-conducting depletion region depends on the magnitude of the reverse bias voltage, this voltage can be used to control the junction capacitance. The varactor bias voltage may be generated in a number of ways and there may need to be no significant moving parts in the final design.
Varactors have a number of disadvantages including temperature drift and aging, electronic noise, low Q factor and non-linearity.

===Digital VFOs===
Modern radio receivers and transmitters usually use some form of digital frequency synthesis to generate their VFO signal.
The advantages include smaller designs, lack of moving parts, the higher stability of set frequency reference oscillators, and the ease with which preset frequencies can be stored and manipulated in the digital computer that is usually embedded in the design in any case.

It is also possible for the radio to become extremely frequency-agile in that the control computer could alter the radio&#x27;s tuned frequency many tens, thousands or even millions of times a second.
This capability allows communications receivers effectively to monitor many channels at once, perhaps using digital selective calling (DSC) techniques to decide when to open an audio output channel and alert users to incoming communications.
Pre-programmed frequency agility also forms the basis of some military radio encryption and stealth techniques.
Extreme frequency agility lies at the heart of spread spectrum techniques that have gained mainstream acceptance in computer wireless networking such as Wi-Fi.

There are disadvantages to digital synthesis such as the inability of a digital synthesiser to tune smoothly through all frequencies, but with the channelisation of many radio bands, this can also be seen as an advantage in that it prevents radios from operating in between two recognised channels.

Digital frequency synthesis relies on stable crystal controlled reference frequency sources. Crystal-controlled oscillators are more stable than inductively and capacitively controlled oscillators. Their disadvantage is that changing frequency (more than a small amount) requires changing the crystal, but frequency synthesizer techniques have made this unnecessary in modern designs.

====Digital frequency synthesis====
The electronic and digital techniques involved in this include:
;Direct digital synthesis (DDS): Enough data points for a mathematical sine function are stored in digital memory. These are recalled at the right speed and fed to a digital-to-analog converter where the required sine wave is built up.
;Direct frequency synthesis: Early channelized communication radios had multiple crystals - one for each channel on which they could operate. After a while this thinking was combined with the basic ideas of heterodyning and mixing described under purpose above. Multiple crystals can be mixed in various combinations to produce various output frequencies.
;Phase locked loop (PLL): Using a varactor-controlled or voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) (described above in varactor under analog VFO techniques) and a phase detector, a control-loop can be set up so that the VCO&#x27;s output is frequency-locked to a crystal-controlled reference oscillator. The phase detector&#x27;s comparison is made between the outputs of the two oscillators after frequency division by different divisors. Then by altering the frequency-division divisor(s) under computer control, a variety of actual (undivided) VCO output frequencies can be generated. The PLL technique dominates most radio VFO designs today.

==Performance==
The quality metrics for a VFO include frequency stability, phase noise and spectral purity. All of these factors tend to be inversely proportional to the tuning circuit&#x27;s Q factor. Since in general the tuning range is also inversely proportional to Q, these performance factors generally degrade as the VFO&#x27;s frequency range is increased.

===Stability===
Stability is the measure of how far a VFO&#x27;s output frequency drifts with time and temperature. To mitigate this problem, VFOs are generally &quot;phase locked&quot; to a stable reference oscillator. PLLs use negative feedback to correct for the frequency drift of the VFO allowing for both wide tuning range and good frequency stability.

===Repeatability===
Ideally, for the same control input to the VFO, the oscillator should generate exactly the same frequency. A change in the calibration of the VFO can change receiver tuning calibration; periodic re-alignment of a receiver may be needed. VFO&#x27;s used as part of a phase-locked loop frequency synthesizer have less stringent requirements since the system is as stable as the crystal-controlled reference frequency.

===Purity===

A plot of a VFO&#x27;s amplitude vs. frequency may show several peaks, probably harmonically related. Each of these peaks can potentially mix with some other incoming signal and produce a &quot;spurious&quot; response. These &quot;spurii&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;spuriae&quot;) can result in increased noise or two signals detected where there should only be one. Additional components can be added to a VFO to suppress high-frequency parasitic oscillations, should these be present.

In a transmitter, these spurious signals are generated along with the one desired signal. Filtering may be required to ensure the transmitted signal meets regulations for bandwidth and spurious emissions.

===Phase noise===

When examined with very sensitive equipment, the pure sine-wave peak in a VFO&#x27;s frequency graph will most likely turn out not to be sitting on a flat noise-floor. Slight random &#x27;jitters&#x27; in the signal&#x27;s timing will mean that the peak is sitting on &#x27;skirts&#x27; of phase noise at frequencies either side of the desired one.

These are also troublesome in crowded bands. They allow through unwanted signals that are fairly close to the expected one, but because of the random quality of these phase-noise &#x27;skirts&#x27;, the signals are usually unintelligible, appearing just as extra noise in the received signal. The effect is that what should be a clean signal in a crowded band can appear to be a very noisy signal, because of the effects of strong signals nearby.

The effect of VFO phase noise on a transmitter is that random noise is actually transmitted either side of the required signal. Again, this must be avoided for legal reasons in many cases.

===Frequency reference===
Digital or digitally controlled oscillators typically rely on constant single frequency references, which can be made to a higher standard than semiconductor and LC circuit-based alternatives. Most commonly a quartz crystal based oscillator is used, although in high accuracy applications such as TDMA cellular networks, atomic clocks such as the Rubidium standard are as of 2018 also common.

Because of the stability of the reference used, digital oscillators themselves tend to be more stable and more repeatable in the long term. This in part explains their huge popularity in low-cost and computer-controlled VFOs. In the shorter term the imperfections introduced by digital frequency division and multiplication (jitter), and the susceptibility of the common quartz standard to acoustic shocks, temperature variation, aging, and even radiation, limit the applicability of a naïve digital oscillator.

This is why higher end VFO&#x27;s like RF transmitters locked to atomic time, tend to combine multiple different references, and in complex ways. Some references like rubidium or cesium clocks provide higher long term stability, while others like hydrogen masers yield lower short term phase noise. Then lower frequency (and so lower cost) oscillators phase locked to a digitally divided version of the master clock deliver the eventual VFO output, smoothing out the noise induced by the division algorithms. Such an arrangement can then give all of the longer term stability and repeatability of an exact reference, the benefits of exact digital frequency selection, and the short term stability, imparted even onto an arbitrary frequency analogue waveform—the best of all worlds.

<text>The Silver Medal of Military Valor () is an Italian medal for gallantry.

Italian medals for valor were first instituted by Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia on 21 May 1793, with a gold medal, and, below it, a silver medal. These were intended for junior officers or common soldiers who had distinguished themselves in combat.

These medals fell into disuse during the period of Napoleonic domination. They were reinstated on 1 April 1815, by Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia, who, however, abolished them only a few months later, on 4 August 1815, replacing them with the Military Order of Savoy (l&#x27;Ordine militare di Savoia), now known as the Military Order of Italy.

However, in 1833, Charles Albert of Sardinia, recognizing that the Military Order was too exclusive in that it could only be awarded to persons of high rank, re-instituted the medals for valor (gold and silver) as awards for noble acts performed by soldiers in both war and peace.

According to royal decree no. 753 of 24 May 1915, the number of times one individual could receive a medal for valor (both silver and gold) was limited to three, after which a promotion was foreseen. This limit was abolished with royal decree no. 975 of 15 June 1922.

During World War I, the medal was awarded to military personnel, units above the level of company and civilians for exceptional valor in the face of the enemy.

During World War I, the medal was given out some 38,614 times for individual acts of heroism (compared to 368 Gold Medals and 60,244 Bronze medals).

Thus, the Italian Silver Medal for Military Valor is equivalent in frequency and prestige to the British Military Cross, which was awarded some 40,253 times during World War I.

The Silver Medal for Military Valor is still awarded by the Italian state, and it, along with the Gold and Bronze medals for Military Valor as well as the &quot;Croce di Guerra al Valor Militare&quot; (War Cross of Military Valor - which can only be awarded in time of war) is established by the Royal Decree of 4 November 1932, in which the purpose of these medals is defined as &quot;To distinguish and publicly honor the authors of heroic military acts, even ones performed in time of peace, provided that the exploit is closely connected with the purposes for which the Armed Forces are constituted, whatever may be the condition or quality of the author.&quot;

<text>The , , or , is alleged to be the preferred weapon of the &quot;shinobi&quot; of feudal Japan, described in one 21st-century portrayal as carried on the person&#x27;s back, specifically horizontally at a height of around that of the person&#x27;s waist. It is portrayed by modern ninjutsu practitioners (including Masaaki Hatsumi and Stephen K. Hayes) as the weapon of the ninja, and features prominently in popular culture. Contemporary examples of this sword are displayed at the Koka Ninja Village Museum in Kōka, Shiga, at the Gifu Castle Archives Museum in Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, Japan and at the Ninja Museum of Igaryu, established in the mid-1960s.

Historically, there is no evidence for the existence of this &quot;katana-like short sword legendarily used by ninja&quot; before the 20th century. Instead, the designs demonstrated by alleged replicas may be based on the design of &quot;wakizashi&quot; or &quot;chokutō&quot; swords or the swords associated with ashigaru—common infantrymen with no &quot;ninja&quot; aspects.

==History==
Because of the lack of any physical evidence or antique swords from the Sengoku to the Edo matching the description of the ninjatō, the history of the weapon can only be chronicled reliably from the 20th century onwards.
*1956: The first known photograph of a straight-blade &quot;ninja&quot; sword was featured in a 26-page Japanese booklet entitled &quot;Ninjutsu&quot; by Heishichirō Okuse.
*1964: The Ninja Museum of Igaryu in Japan, which houses contemporary examples of the sword, is established. That same year, the swords appeared in and , the 4th and 5th entries in the Japanese jidaigeki movie series &quot;Shinobi no Mono&quot;, released in theaters in Japan.
*1973: Ads selling newly manufactured and imported ninja swords appear in the American magazine &quot;Black Belt&quot;.
*1981: Books containing references to the sword written by Masaaki Hatsumi, the founder of the Bujinkan, and Stephen K. Hayes, an American who studied under Hatsumi in 1975, are published.
*1981: The first Hollywood film to feature the ninjatō, &quot;Enter the Ninja&quot;, was released in theaters.
*1983: The next Hollywood film to feature the ninjatō, &quot;Revenge of the Ninja&quot;, was released in theaters in September 1983.
*1984: The first American television production to feature these swords, &quot;The Master&quot;, was broadcast on NBC from January to August 1984.

==Appearance==
The ninjatō is typically depicted as being a short sword, often portrayed as having a straight blade (similar to that of a shikomizue) with a square guard. Usually of a length &quot;less than 60 cm&quot;, the rest of the sword is comparatively &quot;thick, heavy and straight&quot;. Despite the disputed historical existence of the ninjato, Hayes claims to describe it in detail, and suggests that the typical description of the ninjatō could be due to ninja having to forge their own blades from slabs of steel or iron with the cutting edge being ground on a stone, with straight blades being easier to form than the much more refined curved traditional Japanese sword. His second offered reason for ninjatō being described as a straight-bladed, rather short sword is that the ninja were emulating one of the patron Buddhist deities of ninja families, Fudo Myo-oh, who, per Hayes, is depicted brandishing a straight-bladed short sword similar to a chokutō.

==Usage==
Due to the lack of historical evidence regarding the existence of the ninjatō, techniques for usage in a martial context are largely speculative. When used in film and stage, ninjatō are depicted as being shorter than a katana with a straight blade but they are utilized in a &quot;nearly identical&quot; manner as the katana. Books and other written materials have described a number of possible ways to use the sword including &quot;fast draw techniques centered around drawing the sword and cutting as a simultaneous defensive or attacking action&quot;, with &quot;a thrust fencing technique&quot;, and with a &quot;reverse grip&quot;.

Contemporary sources allege the scabbard was used for various purposes, such as a respiration pipe (snorkel) in underwater activities or for secretly overhearing conversations. The scabbard is also said to have been longer than the blade of the ninjatō in order to hide various objects such as chemicals used to blind pursuers. The tsuba (hand guard) of the ninjato is described in one contemporary source as being larger than average and square instead of the much more common round tsuba. One source&#x27;s belief about the ninjatō tsuba size and shape is that the user would lean the sword against a wall and would use the tsuba as a step to extend his normal reach, and the sword would then be retrieved by pulling it up by the sageo (saya cord).

<doc id="436173" wikidata="Q1232442" url="?curid=436173" title="Ogygia">
<text>Ogygia (; , or &quot;Ōgygíā&quot; ) is an island mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Book V, as the home of the nymph Calypso, the daughter of the Titan Atlas. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Calypso detained Odysseus on Ogygia for seven years and kept him from returning to his home of Ithaca, wanting to marry him.

Athena complained about Calypso&#x27;s actions to Zeus, who sent the messenger Hermes to Ogygia to order Calypso to release Odysseus. Hermes is Odysseus&#x27;s great grandfather on his mother&#x27;s side, through Autolycos. Calypso finally, though reluctantly, instructed Odysseus to build a small raft, gave him food and wine, and let him depart the island.

The &quot;Odyssey&quot; describes Ogygia as follows:

==Location==
A long-standing tradition begun by Euhemerus in the late 4th century BC and supported by Callimachus, endorsed by modern Maltese tradition, identifies Ogygia with the island of Gozo, the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago.

Aeschylus calls the Nile Ogygian, and Eustathius the Byzantine grammarian said that Ogygia was the earliest name for Egypt, while other suggested locations for Ogygia include the Ionian Sea.

Maps of historians and geographers like Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d&#x27;Anville, Philipp Clüver, Petrus Bertius and Aaron Arrowsmith refer to Ogygia as an island northwest of Corfu, Ionian Islands, Greece, which adds fuel to modern Greek tradition that Ogygia is, indeed, the same island as the island of Othonoi.

Victor Bérard identified Perejil as the location of the mythical island of Ogygia.

==Geographical account by Strabo==

Approximately seven centuries after Homer, the Alexandrian geographer Strabo criticized Polybius on the geography of the Odyssey. Strabo proposed that Scheria and Ogygia were located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
==Geographical account by Plutarch==

Plutarch also gives an account of the location of Ogygia:

The passage of Plutarch has created some controversy. W. Hamilton indicated the similarities of Plutarch&#x27;s account on &quot;the great continent&quot; and Plato&#x27;s location of Atlantis in &quot;Timaeus&quot; 24E – 25A. Kepler in his &quot;Kepleri Astronomi Opera Omnia&quot; estimated that “the great continent” was America and attempted to locate Ogygia and the surrounding islands. Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh used &quot;Ogygia&quot; as a synonym for Ireland in the title of his Irish history, &quot;Ogygia: Seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia&quot; (&quot;Ogygia: Or a Chronological Account of Irish Events&quot;), 1685. Wilhelm von Christ was convinced that the continent was America and states that in the 1st-century sailors traveling through Iceland, Greenland, and the Baffin Region (Qikiqtaaluk) reached the North American coast.

==Primeval &quot;Ogygia&quot;==
&quot;Ogygia&quot; is associated with the Ogygian deluge and with the mythological figure Ogyges, in the sense that the word &quot;Ogygian&quot; means &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;at earliest dawn&quot;, which would suggest that Homer&#x27;s Ogygia was a primeval island. However, Ogyges as a primeval, aboriginal ruler was usually sited in Boeotia, where he founded Thebes there, naming it Ogygia at the time.
In another account of Ogyges, he brought his people to the area first known as Acte. That land was subsequently called Ogygia in his honor but ultimately known as Attica.

Ogygia is used by Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty as an allegory for Ireland in his book published in 1685 as Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia &amp; etc., in 1793 translated into English by Rev. James Hely, as &quot;Ogygia, or a Chronological account of Irish Events (collected from Very Ancient Documents faithfully compared with each other &amp; supported by the Genealogical &amp; Chronological Aid of the Sacred and Profane Writings of the Globe”.

==Namesake==
Ogygia Island in Antarctica is named after the mythical island.

The first list of (with 17 names in total) was compiled by the 12th Jinmaku Kyūgorō in 1900 but was not regarded as official until 1926 when it was published by the newly formed Japan Sumo Association and updated to 31 names. Since that time, 43 more have been promoted. The Sumo Association have overseen all promotions since Chiyonoyama&#x27;s in 1951. Two consecutive tournament championships or an &quot;equivalent performance&quot; at level are the minimum requirement for promotion to in modern sumo.

<doc id="436181" wikidata="Q862836" url="?curid=436181" title="Billiard Congress of America">
<text>The Billiard Congress of America (BCA) is the governing body for cue sports in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, and the regional member organization of the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA). It was established under this name in 1948 as a non-profit trade organization in order to promote the sport and organize its players via tournaments at various levels. The BCA is headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado. The voting members of the organization are mostly equipment manufacturers.

The BCA publishes an annual rule and record book that incorporates the WPA world standardized rules for games such as nine-ball, eight-ball, ten-ball and straight pool, as well as rules for other games that are not presently the subject of international competition, such as one pocket, bank pool, cowboy pool, rotation, American snooker, and Chicago among many others. The BCA holds an annual trade show, the International Billiards &amp; Home Recreation Expo. Also annually, it inducts great players, and those who have made great contributions to the sport, into the BCA Hall of Fame.

==History==
The origins of the BCA began with the National Billiard Association of America (NBAA), founded July 25, 1921. The organization rapidly became the &quot;de facto&quot; governing body of the sport in the United States, with 35,000 members by 1928, and was closely tied to the Brunswick-Balke-Collender company, a major equipment manufacturer. After a decline in influence in the late 1930s, in part owing to a dispute with world carom billiards champion Willie Hoppe, the NBAA reformed in 1941 as the Billiard Association of America (BAA). Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, and calling itself &quot;the Governing Body of Billiards&quot;, the BAA produced a concise, portable, inexpensive rulebook of carom and pool games that was to serve as the model for future BCA releases. The BAA in turn became the BCA in 1947. The BCA formed with, and for several years shared offices with, the promotional trade association National Billiard Council (NBC), now defunct. Early BCA rulebooks were essentially identical to the 1946 BAA edition, including the cover art and the absence of the increasingly popular game nine-ball from the ruleset. (Nine-ball did not appear until the 1967 edition.) The BCA rulebooks have remained in near-annual continuous publication to the present day.

In 2000, the BCA made the major move of adopting the World Pool-Billiard Association&#x27;s standardized rules for eight-ball, nine-ball, and other games subject to international professional competition. The BCA had by this time become the national affiliate of the WPA. In the new edition of the rules, the organization expressed a commitment to seeing pool and carom billiards become Olympic sports (and in fact selected Colorado Springs for its new headquarters for proximity to the US Olympic Committee). The rules changes have not been without controversy, as some of them upset US player expectations; various leagues have ignored the new rules and continued with traditional US rules (e.g., in the game of eight-ball, legally pocketing the 8 ball on the has commonly been treated as an instant win).

==BCA Hall of Fame==

In 1966, the Billiard Congress of America created its hall of fame to honor people who have been known to enrich the sport, containing two categories — &quot;The Greatest Player&quot;, a category including players who played either internationally or nationally for 20 years or more and have won at least one national or international championship, and &quot;The Meritorious Service&quot;, a category for players that have made &quot;lasting, memorable and important contributions&quot; to billiards.

==International Billiard &amp; Home Recreation Expo==
The BCA&#x27;s annual Billiard Expo (as it is known for short, or simply the Expo, within the industry) is the largest mostly-cue-sports trade convention in the world, and despite its broad name is primarily focused on pool (pocket billiards). It has been held in various locations, most frequently Las Vegas, Nevada, since its founding in 1984. The Expo is exclusively sponsored by the BCA (and its members), and is managed by William T. Glasgow, Inc. of Orland Park, Illinois. The expressed purpose of the event is to &quot;provide industry manufacturers, distributors, retailers, dealers and poolroom operators an annual venue for new business opportunities, including education, new products and networking.&quot; Vendor attendance in 2006 was nearly 300 companies filling between 1,300 and 1,400 booth spaces. The June 25–27, 2009 event at the Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas saw 116 exhibitor in 412 booth spaces, with 1,120 buy attendees. The next event will be held June 14 (Wednesday) through 16 (Friday), 2010, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, with registration for attendees opening February 15. These were not the original dates, and some debate surrounded the matter, with the dates being finalized only as late as September 2009, and chosen to ensure maximum attendance by billiard entrepreneurs, most of whom have business peaks on weekends. By the end of the 2009 Expo, 65 companies had already contracted for 326 booth spaces at the 2010 Expo.

The vast majority of attendees are industry insiders, rather than players. In 2006, 94% were billiard retailers, 5% billiard hall operators, and 1% &quot;other&quot; (e.g. bowling and amusement center operators). In 2009, only 70% were retailers. In that year, 83% were from the United States and 7% from Canada, with the remaining 10% being from elsewhere around the world. Despite operators not being in the majority, the event is geared toward them, with &quot;Business of Billiards&quot; seminars on successful hall operation, and exhibitors principally in the business of supplying such venues. Exhibiting vendors typically include product lines such as pool equipment (tables, cues, racks, chalk, etc.), billiards-themed apparel and accessories, instructional materials, bar and billiard furniture and furnishings (stools, neon signs, juke boxes, etc.), business services (food processing, point-of-sale computer systems, etc.), other commercial gaming equipment (darts, table shuffleboard, foosball, video games, pinball machines, etc.), plus assorted home recreation categories (poker, home spas and pools, tanning beds, sound systems, outdoors equipment, etc.), and billiard-related services such as cue repair. The BCA claims that, as of 2009, 55% of attendees make purchasing decisions for their businesses, 50% buy there, and 20% more buy within one month of the show.

While Las Vegas is the most frequent host city for the event, it has also been held in Charlotte, North Carolina, Houston, Texas, Baltimore, Maryland, New Orleans, Louisiana, Kansas City, Missouri, Orlando, Florida, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Nashville, Tennessee, Louisville, Kentucky, and Ft. Worth, Texas.

As of the 2010 event, the cost per exhibitor booth varied from US$1,350 to $1,800 depending upon BCA membership status. The event ticket price was $100 for non-exhibitors and non-members. These prices were up from $1,200 and $50, respectively, in 2007.

==BCA Pool League==
The BCA Pool League (BCAPL) is one of the major amateur pool leagues in the United States and is present in over a dozen other countries outside the U.S., with a significant presence in Canada. Originally operated by the BCA, since 2004 the BCAPL has been owned and operated by billiards event promoter CueSports International (CSI) of Henderson, Nevada.

The BCA Pool League has approximately 450 local leagues with 60,000+ members. Leagues are played on both bar-size and regulation tables. Beginning in the 2009/2010 season, CSI introduced a second league, the USA Pool League (USAPL), aimed at a more casual player. Both the BCAPL and USAPL (who share a rulebook) use BCA rules, with the addition of wheelchair rules, team play adaptations, and &quot;Applied Rulings&quot; from years of large-scale tournament administration.

== Collegiate National Championship ==
The US Collegiate Pocket Billiards National Championship, organized by the Association of College Unions International (ACUI) since 1937, with separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s divisions since 1939, is recognized and supported by the BCA. The amateur tournament&#x27;s annual champions are listed in the BCA&#x27;s &quot;Billiards: The Official Rules and Records Book&quot;.

==United States Billiard Media Association==
The United States Billiard Media Association (USBmA) was organized in January 2007 to elect &quot;billiard media members to the Billiard Congress of America&#x27;s Hall of Fame Board&quot;. This media-focused suborganization also lists other goals in its materials, including &quot;elevating the visibility and status of billiards in the media at large&quot; as well as various member-support functions. Membership is strictly limited to &quot;professional print, radio, TV, public relations and Internet media persons who cover cue sports&quot;, as determined by the USBmA executive board. As of February 2010, the group listed 33 members, including most of the better-known names in US-based cue sports publishing. USBmA is nominally based in Chicago, Illinois, at the same address as &quot;Billiards Digest&quot; (Luby Publishing).

<doc id="436208" wikidata="Q3091220" url="?curid=436208" title="Solar thermal rocket">
<text>A solar thermal rocket is a theoretical spacecraft propulsion system that would make use of solar power to directly heat reaction mass, and therefore would not require an electrical generator, like most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do. The rocket would only have to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as concentrators and mirrors. The heated propellant would be fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust. Its engine thrust would be directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation.

In the shorter term, solar thermal propulsion has been proposed both for longer-life, lower-cost, more efficient use of the sun and more-flexible cryogenic upper stage launch vehicles and for on-orbit propellant depots. Solar thermal propulsion is also a good candidate for use in reusable inter-orbital tugs, as it is a high-efficiency low-thrust system that can be refuelled with relative ease.

==Solar-thermal design concepts==

There are two solar thermal propulsion concepts, differing primarily in the method by which they use solar power to heat up the propellant:
*&quot;Indirect solar heating&quot; involves pumping the propellant through passages in a heat exchanger that is heated by solar radiation. The windowless heat exchanger cavity concept is a design taking this radiation absorption approach.
*&quot;Direct solar heating&quot; involves exposing the propellant directly to solar radiation. The rotating bed concept is one of the preferred concepts for direct solar radiation absorption; it offers higher specific impulse than other direct heating designs by using a retained seed (tantalum carbide or hafnium carbide) approach. The propellant flows through the porous walls of a rotating cylinder, picking up heat from the seeds, which are retained on the walls by the rotation. The carbides are stable at high temperatures and have excellent heat transfer properties.

Due to limitations in the temperature that heat exchanger materials can withstand (approximately 2800 K), the indirect absorption designs cannot achieve specific impulses beyond 900 seconds (900 s· = 8.8 km/s) (or up to 1000 seconds, see below). The direct absorption designs allow higher propellant temperatures and therefore higher specific impulses, approaching 1200 seconds. Even the lower specific impulse represents a significant increase over that of conventional chemical rockets, however, an increase that can provide substantial payload gains (45 percent for a LEO-to-GEO mission) at the expense of increased trip time (14 days compared to 10 hours).

Small-scale hardware has been designed and fabricated for the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (AFRPL) for ground test evaluation. Systems with 10 to 100 N of thrust have been investigated by SART.

Reusable Orbital Transfer Vehicles (OTV), sometimes called (inter-orbital) space tugs, propelled by solar thermal rockets have been proposed. The concentrators on solar thermal tugs are less susceptible to radiation in the Van Allen belts than the solar arrays of solar electric OTV.

An initial proof of concept was demonstrated in 2020 with helium at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory solar simulator.

==Propellants==

Most proposed designs for solar thermal rockets use hydrogen as their propellant due to its low molecular weight which gives excellent specific impulse of up to 1000 seconds (10 kN·s/kg) using heat exchangers made of rhenium.

Conventional thought has been that hydrogen—although it gives excellent specific impulse—is not space storable. Design work in the early 2010s has developed an approach to substantially reduce hydrogen boiloff, and to economically utilize the small remaining boiloff product for requisite in-space tasks, essentially achieving zero boil off (ZBO) from a practical point of view.

Other substances could also be used. Water gives quite poor performance of 190 seconds (1.9 kN·s/kg), but requires only simple equipment to purify and handle, and is space storable and this has very seriously been proposed for interplanetary use, using in-situ resources. 

Ammonia has been proposed as a propellant. It offers higher specific impulse than water, but is easily storable, with a freezing point of −77 degrees Celsius and a boiling point of −33.34 °C.

A solar-thermal propulsion architecture outperforms architectures involving electrolysis and liquification of hydrogen from water by more than an order of magnitude, since electrolysis requires heavy power generators, whereas distillation only requires a simple and compact heat source (either nuclear or solar); so the propellant production rate is correspondingly far higher for any given initial mass of equipment. However its use does rely on having clear ideas of the location of water ice in the solar system, particularly on lunar and asteroidal bodies, and such information is not known, other than that the bodies within the asteroid belt and further from the Sun are expected to be rich in water ice.

==Solar-thermal for ground launch==

Solar thermal rockets have been proposed as a system for launching a small personal spacecraft into orbit. The design is based on a high altitude airship which uses its envelope to focus sunlight onto a tube. The propellant, which would likely be ammonia, is then fed through to produce thrust. Possible design flaws include whether the engine could produce enough thrust to overcome drag, and whether the skin of the airship wouldn&#x27;t fail at hypersonic velocities. This has many similarities to the orbital airship proposed by JP Aerospace.

==Proposed solar-thermal space systems==
, two proposals for utilizing solar-thermal propulsion on in-space post-launch spacecraft systems had been made.

A concept to provide low Earth orbit (LEO) propellant depots that could be used as way-stations for other spacecraft to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO missions has proposed that waste gaseous hydrogen—an inevitable byproduct of long-term liquid hydrogen storage in the radiative heat environment of space—would be usable as a monopropellant in a solar-thermal propulsion system. The waste hydrogen would be productively utilized for both orbital stationkeeping and attitude control, as well as providing limited propellant and thrust to use for orbital maneuvers to better rendezvous with other spacecraft that would be inbound to receive fuel from the depot.

Solar-thermal monoprop hydrogen thrusters are also integral to the design of the next-generation cryogenic upper stage rocket proposed by U.S. company United Launch Alliance (ULA). The Advanced Common Evolved Stage (ACES) was intended as a lower-cost, more-capable and more-flexible upper stage that would supplement, and perhaps replace, the existing ULA Centaur and ULA Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) upper stage vehicles. The ACES Integrated Vehicle Fluids option eliminates all hydrazine monopropellant and all helium pressurant from the space vehicle—normally used for attitude control and station keeping—and depends instead on solar-thermal monoprop thrusters using waste hydrogen.

The viability of various trips using Solar Thermal propulsion was investigated by Gordon Woodcock and Dave Byers in 2003.

A subsequent proposal in the 2010s was the Solar Moth spacecraft that would use lightweight mirrors to focus solar radiation on a solar thermal engine.

<text>Walter Brown Newman (11 February 1916 – 14 October 1993) was an American radio writer and screenwriter active from the late 1940s to the early 1990s. He was nominated three times for Academy Awards (&quot;Ace in the Hole,&quot; &quot;Cat Ballou,&quot; and &quot;Bloodbrothers&quot;), but he is best-known for a work that never made it to the screen: his unproduced original script &quot;Harrow Alley&quot;, which &quot;has achieved legendary status in Hollywood.&quot;

Newman earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at New York University and studied law at Harvard University. After working as a publicist in New York and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he moved to Los Angeles and began writing radio dramas. Newman&#x27;s radio writing included scripts for &quot;Escape&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, and &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot; as well as the first broadcast episode of &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot;

He is not officially credited for his screenplays for &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, having renounced after sharp disagreements with the director, John Sturges in both cases, over changes made during shooting.

Newman was born in New York City. He died in Sherman Oaks, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, on 14 October 1993.

<text>Eric Mottram (29 December 1924 – 16 January 1995) was a British teacher, critic, editor and poet who was one of the central figures in the British Poetry Revival.

==Early life and education==
Mottram was born in London and educated at Purley Grammar School, Croydon, and Blackpool Grammar School, Lancashire. In 1943, he was awarded a scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge, but opted to serve in the Royal Navy instead, only taking up the scholarship in 1947. He graduated with honours in 1950, obtaining a first in both parts of the English Literature, Life and Thought tripos (Double First). M.A. in 1951. Over the following decade, Mottram travelled extensively and worked as a lecturer at the University of Zurich, Switzerland (1951–52), University of Malaya in Singapore (1952–55), and as Professor at the University of Groningen, Netherlands (1955–60).

==King&#x27;s College London==
In 1960, Mottram returned to London and took a post as Lecturer in English and American Literature at King&#x27;s College London. At the time, King&#x27;s was one of very few British universities to offer American studies, and Mottram was to prove a pioneer in the field. He co-founded the Institute of United States Studies in 1963, the same year in which his tenure as a lecturer at King&#x27;s was confirmed. In 1973, became Reader in English and American Literature and a special Chair was created for him as professor in 1982. In September 1990 he retired with the title Emeritus Professor of English and American Literature.

==Mottram and the Beat Generation==
In the early 1960s, Mottram travelled to the United States and met a number of writers, including William Carlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg and others. He became friendly with William Burroughs during his time in London. These contacts resulted in three of Mottram&#x27;s best-known critical books - &quot;William Burroughs: the algebra of need&quot; (1971, British edition 1977), &quot;Allen Ginsberg in the Sixties &quot; (1972) and &quot;Paul Bowles: staticity &amp; terror&quot; (1976). These studies did much to help introduce the Beat Generation writers to a wider British audience.

==Mottram and Robert Duncan==
Mottram corresponded with the American poet Robert Duncan between 1971 and 1986. The full correspondence was published as &quot;The Unruly Garden: Robert Duncan and Eric Mottram, Letters and Essays&quot;, edited and with an Introduction by Amy Evans and Shamoon Zamir (Peter Lang, 2007).

==Mottram as poet==
Mottram&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Inside the Whale&quot;, was published by Bob Cobbing&#x27;s Writers Forum in 1970. Mottram went on to publish at least another 34 collections, including &quot;A Book of Herne: 1975–1981&quot;, &quot;Elegies&quot; (both 1981) and &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1989).

Kears proposes Mottram as a key overlooked figure of 20th-century medievalism, suggesting that Mottram&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Herne&quot; &#x27;developed forms of collage that brought the early medieval past into collision with new ways of thinking about poetic form&#x27;.

His work clearly shows the influence of the American &quot;avant-garde&quot; poets he admired, particularly in his use of techniques such as found poetry, cut-up technique and collage, but it also has a distinctly British quality in the tradition of Basil Bunting.

An interview with Mottram appeared in the London-based magazine &quot;Angel Exhaust&quot;, along with his poetry.

An interview and poetry reading, recorded in 1982, appears in My KPFA.

==Mottram as editor==
In 1971, Mottram was made editor of the Poetry Society&#x27;s magazine &quot;Poetry Review&quot;. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key poets associated with the British Poetry Revival and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them. Mottram also included work by a number of American poets, a fact that ultimately led to his removal from the post.

During this period, Mottram was twice a guest lecturer at Kent State University, where, along with Black Mountain poet Ed Dorn, he was an early supporter of the musical group Devo, and its founders Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis, whose poetry Mottram published when he was editor of &quot;Poetry Review&quot;. He also edited &quot; The Rexroth Reader&quot; (1972) and the section of the 1988 anthology &quot;The New British Poetry&quot; that was given over to the poets associated with the Revival.

== Death, archives and collections ==
Mottram died 16 January 1995 in London.
His archive is now in the care of the King&#x27;s College London Archives. Mottram&#x27;s &quot;protege&quot; Bill Griffiths assisted with organising the collection and it is currently being completed by Valerie Soar. Carl Kears notes that within the archive the influence of medieval poetry, especially Old English poetry is apparent.

An article by Eric Mottram: &quot;Notes on Poetics&quot;, Curriculum Vitae, Letter and three poems, and the complete Eric Mottram bibliography, are collated in a dossier edited by T. Wignesan, &quot;The Journal of Comparative Poetics&quot;, Vol. I, No. 1 (Paris), Spring 1989, pp. 37–63. Volume 1, Nos 2 &amp; 3 of the same journal include a supplement to the Eric Mottram bibliography by Clive Bush.
