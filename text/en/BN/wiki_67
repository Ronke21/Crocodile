<text>The USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident was a Japanese bombing attack on the U.S. Navy river gunboat and three Standard Oil Company tankers on the Yangtze River near the Chinese capital of Nanjing on December 12, 1937. Japan and the United States were not at war at the time. The boats were part of the American naval operation called the Yangtze Patrol, which began following the joint British, French, and American victory in the Second Opium War. 

The bombing raid resulted in the sinking of the &quot;Panay&quot; as well as the deaths of three Americans on board, plus an unknown but likely high casualty toll amongst the Chinese passengers in the three river tankers. 

Public reaction was mixed in the U.S., with the president weighing various diplomatic and military responses only to settle for an apology and compensation. 

The Japanese claimed that they did not see the large U.S. flags painted on the deck and canvases of the gunboat. Tokyo officially apologized and paid a cash indemnity of $2.2 million USD. The settlement mollified some of the U.S. anger, and newspapers called the matter closed. 

However, camera footage taken during the attack showed Japanese aircraft flying so low near the &quot;Panay&quot; that the pilots&#x27; faces were visible, providing &quot;potent evidence that the mistaken identity claim was not true.&quot;

The attack on the &quot;Panay&quot; was not an isolated case in the Battle of Nanjing. In addition to the &quot;Panay&quot; and her consort of three tankers, Japanese aircraft and land forces would attack a multitude of other vessels belonging to the Western powers along the Yangtze near Nanjing. 

==Background==
A flat-bottomed craft built in Shanghai specifically for river duty, &quot;Panay&quot; served as part of the US Navy&#x27;s Yangtze Patrol in the Asiatic Fleet, which was responsible for patrolling the Yangtze River to protect American lives and property in China. 

After invading China in the summer of 1937, Japanese forces had fought their way to the city of Nanjing by in the early weeks of December. The Japanese then began a fierce attack on the city and its surrounding region, which would later culminate in the infamous massacre that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians and prisoners of war. 
Since November, the &quot;Panay&quot; had been evacuating U.S. citizens from the battle zone around Nanjing. On December 11, the &quot;Panay&quot; evacuated some of the last remaining Americans from the city, bringing the number of people aboard to five officers, 54 enlisted men, four US embassy staff, and 10 civilians, including Universal Newsreel cameraman Norman Alley, Fox Movietone News cameraman Eric Mayell, the &quot;New York Times&#x27;&quot;s Norman Soong, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; correspondent Jim Marshall, &quot;La Stampa&quot; correspondent Sandro Sandri and &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; correspondent Luigi Barzini Jr.

The &quot;Panay&quot; was also tasked with escorting three Standard Oil tankers, &quot;Mei Ping&quot;, &quot;Mei An&quot;, and &quot;Mei Hsia,&quot; which were carrying some 800 Chinese employees of Standard Vacuum Oil and their families. 

== Attack ==

On the morning of the 12th, Japanese air forces stationed near Nanjing received information that fleeing Chinese forces were in the area in ten large steamers and a large number of junks and that they were between upstream from Nanjing. Japanese naval aircraft led by Lieutenant Okumiya Masatake and Lieutenant Shigeharu Murata (who would lead torpedo bombers at Pearl Harbor four years later) departed from Changzhou.

While anchored some 28 miles upstream from Nanjing, &quot;Panay&quot; and her three consorts, came under attack by the Japanese formations. The &quot;Panay&quot; was clearly marked and identified with two large American flags painted on its canvas awnings.

&quot;Panay&quot; was hit by two of the eighteen bombs dropped by three Yokosuka B4Y Type-96 bombers from high altitude, and then strafed by nine Nakajima A4N Type-95 fighters at low altitude. The first bomb split the &quot;Panay&#x27;s&quot; foremast and disabled its forward gun. Shrapnel from several of the bombs that exploded near the vessel damaged the ship&#x27;s hull and injured crew on the deck. Several Americans manned a 30-caliber machine gun on board and returned fire at the Japanese, but did not manage to hit any of the aircraft. 

At 2pm, facing irreparable damage and grievous injuries amongst the crew, Lieutenant Arthur Anders gave the order to abandon ship, and evacuated the crew and civilians onto two motorboats, the vast majority of them wounded. Planes also machine-gunned these small boats taking the wounded ashore, and several more survivors were wounded. According to Lieutenant J.W. Geist, an officer aboard &quot;Panay&quot;, &quot;the day before we told the Japanese army in the area who we were,&quot; and three U.S. flags were plainly visible on the ship. &quot;The Times&quot; correspondent Colin MacDonald, who had also been aboard &quot;Panay&quot;, saw a Japanese army small boat machine-gun the &quot;Panay&quot; as it was sinking in spite of the American flag painted on the side of the ship. Since Japanese planes continued to circle overhead, survivors cowered knee deep in mud in a swamp. 

&quot;Panay&quot;&#x27;s lifeboats were machine-gunned by Japanese fighter planes in the attack. As the ship sank, Japanese colonel Kingoro Hashimoto, who was in the immediate vicinity, ordered his artillery to fire on the &quot;Panay.&quot; Hashimoto would also order his troops to fire on British vessels whose identities he knew.

At 3:54pm, the &quot;Panay&quot; sank as a result of the attack. Storekeeper First Class Charles Lee Ensminger, Standard Oil tanker captain Carl H. Carlson and Italian reporter Sandro Sandri were killed, Coxswain Edgar C. Hulsebus died later that night. 43 sailors and five civilians were wounded.

The three Standard Oil tankers were also bombed and destroyed, and the captain of &quot;Mei An&quot; and many Chinese civilian passengers were killed, although the number was not recorded in Standard Oil&#x27;s Records. Also lost were two of four smaller company craft elsewhere by Japanese attacks. The vessels had been helping to evacuate the families of Standard Oil&#x27;s employees and agents from Nanjing during the Japanese attack on that city.

Two newsreel cameramen, Norman Alley of Universal Newsreel and Eric Mayell of Fox Movietone News, were aboard &quot;Panay&quot; during the attack; they were able to film parts of the attack including Japanese aircraft on low-level strafing runs and, after reaching shore, the sinking of the ship in the middle of the river. The survivors of the attack then waded through knee-deep mud to a nearby village, carrying those too badly wounded to walk. 

The survivors were later taken aboard the American vessel and the British gunboats and . Earlier the same day, a Japanese shore battery had fired on &quot;Ladybird&quot;.
The survivors coped with near freezing nights wearing inadequate clothing along with no food. It took three days to move the sixteen wounded to the safety of several British and American ships.

The Japanese pilots who attacked the &quot;Panay&quot; would also bomb the British vessel SS &quot;Wantung&quot; later that same day.

==Diplomacy==
The aftermath of the &quot;Panay&quot; sinking was a nervous time for the American ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew. Grew, whose experience in the foreign service spanned over 30 years, &quot;remembered the USS &quot;Maine&quot;,&quot; the U.S. Navy ship that blew up in Havana Harbor in 1898. The sinking of &quot;Maine&quot; had propelled the U.S. into the Spanish–American War and ambassador Grew hoped the sinking of &quot;Panay&quot; would not be a similar catalyst for the severance of diplomatic ties and war with Japan.

The Japanese government took full responsibility for sinking &quot;Panay&quot; but continued to maintain that the attack had been unintentional. Chief of Staff of Japanese naval forces in northern China, Vice Admiral Rokuzo Sugiyama, was assigned to make an apology. The formal apology reached Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve.

Although Japanese officials maintained that their pilots never saw any American flags on &quot;Panay&quot;, a US Navy court of inquiry determined that several US flags were clearly visible on the vessel during the attacks. At the meeting held at the American embassy in Tokyo on December 23, Japanese officials maintained that one navy airplane had attacked a boat by machine gun for a short period of time and that Japanese army motor boats or launches had been attacking the Chinese steamers escaping upstream on the opposite bank. However, the Japanese navy insisted that the attack had been unintentional. The Japanese government paid an indemnity of $2,214,007.36 (approximately $ in 2025) to the US on April 22, 1938, officially settling the &quot;Panay&quot; incident.

==Post-incident==

===Donations===
Following the incident, Japanese individuals and organizations sent letters of apology and gifts of money to U.S. diplomatic offices and the U.S. Navy Department in Washington, D.C. This ranged from letters penned by schoolchildren to organized pools of donors.

The most prominent donor was the America-Japan Society, headed by Prince Tokugawa Iesato, which amassed ¥16,242.56 in &quot;Panay&quot; contributions from 7,749 people and 218 organizations.

In response to the donations, Secretary of State Cordell Hull stated that &quot;neither the American Government nor any agency of it nor any of its nationals should receive sums of money thus offered or take direct benefit therefrom.&quot; However, Hull noted that since &quot;a flat rejection of such offers would produce some misunderstanding of our general attitude and offend those Japanese who make such a gesture, the Department is of the opinion that some method should be found whereby Japanese who wish to give that type of expression to their feelings may do so.&quot;

The United States State Department expressed the desire that any necessary arrangements should be made promptly. Hull did not wish to keep the Japanese people waiting for a decision on what was to become of the money they donated. A prolonged delay could lead to misunderstanding, especially if a decision were reached months later to return the money to the donors.

A temporary solution was reached to allow only the American ambassador in Japan and the American ambassador in China to accept donations related to the &quot;Panay&quot; incident. Several American consulates were receiving money, including consulates at Nagoya, Kobe, Nagasaki and Osaka, in Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; Keijo (Seoul), Korea; Dairen, Manchuria; and São Paulo, Brazil. These contributions were eventually forwarded to the ambassador in Tokyo. Grew kept all money received related to the &quot;Panay&quot; incident in the embassy safe until the State Department could find a solution.

Despite this policy, a local newspaper in Nagasaki, the &quot;Nagasaki Minyu Shimbun&quot;, published stories about some Japanese donations to the American consulate in Nagasaki, including an excerpt from a letter attached to a schoolboy&#x27;s donation. Arthur F. Tower, the American consul in Nagasaki, informed Ambassador Grew of the article, which had been published on January 7. Tower also informed Grew that a reporter of another newspaper—the Tokyo and Osaka &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, had called on him on 23 December to discuss the &quot;Panay&quot; contributions. Towers reassured Grew that &quot;this consulate has not sought to give publicity to the donations received or offered and has furnished information concerning them on two occasions only, when requested.&quot; However, the newspaper stories may nonetheless have increased contributions to the location.

A final solution to the donations was reached by creating the Japan-America Trust in the name of the &quot;Panay&quot; survivors and relatives of those who lost their lives. The trust would be used to care for the graves of American sailors buried in Japan, dating back to the graves of sailors involved in the Perry Expedition in 1853. The formation of the trust allowed the State Department to avoid returning donations or directly distributing them to the U.S. government or individuals. (see also Foreign cemeteries in Japan)

===Awards===
Service members aboard the &quot;Panay&quot; were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and China Service Medal.Fireman First Class John L. Hodge and Lieutenant Clark G. Grazier were presented with the Navy Cross for their actions during the &quot;Panay&quot; incident.

The Navy Cross was also presented to two British naval officers, Vice Admiral Lewis Eyre Crabbe and Lieut. Commander Harry Barlow, for their assistance in recovering survivors from the USS &quot;Panay&quot;.

==Responsibility for the attack==
Modern historians believe that the attack may have been intentional. 

Newsreel footage captured by the cameramen aboard the &quot;Panay&quot; showed Japanese aircraft passing so close to the ship that the pilots&#x27; faces were visible, which provided &quot;potent evidence&quot; that Japanese claim of mistaken identity was not true according to American historian Richard B. Frank. Per Roosevelt&#x27;s request, Universal Pictures edited the sequence out of its newsreels per to quell a political crisis. 

According to John Prados, Navy cryptographers had intercepted and decrypted traffic relating to the attacking planes which clearly indicated that they were under orders during the attack and that it had not been a mistake of any kind. This information was not released at the time because it would have revealed that the United States had broken Japanese Naval codes. 

Writer Nick Sparks believes that the chaos in Nanjing created an opportunity for renegade factions within the Japanese army who wanted to force the U.S. into an active conflict so that the Japanese could once and for all drive the U.S. out of China.

The &quot;Panay&quot; was not the only Western vessel attacked on the Yangtze during the Battle of Nanking. The Japanese pilots responsible for the &quot;Panay&quot; attack would bomb the British ship &quot;SS&quot; &quot;Wantung&quot; on the same afternoon. Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto, who had founded a right-wing secret society in Japan and targeted the &quot;Panay&quot; as it sank, had also deliberately shelled the British vessels &quot;SS Scarab&quot; and &quot;HMS Cricket&quot; beforehand&quot;.&quot; When informed that the ships had clearly flown the British flag, Hashimoto responded &quot;I do not recognize any flag but my own.&quot; Hashimoto had also issued orders to his troops to fire on all ships on the Yangtze &quot;regardless of nationality.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Fon Huffman, the last survivor of the incident, died in 2008. The last surviving Japanese pilot who participated in the attack was Kaname Harada, who died in 2016.

The episode has been cited by Philip K. Dick in his novel &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, depicted in a collectible picture-card of the 1940s, in the series &quot;Horrors of War&quot; with the title &quot;The sinking of the Panay.&quot;

The incident features in the 2005 novel &quot;A Winter in China&quot; by the British writer Douglas Galbraith. It is also described in the historical fiction novel &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen.

The 2009 film &quot;John Rabe&quot; portrays a fictionalized version of the incident.

<doc id="439438" wikidata="Q17089409" url="?curid=439438" title="Mad Mad World">
<text>Mad Mad World is the second studio album by Canadian rock singer Tom Cochrane, originally released in 1991 in Canada and in the United States on February 17, 1992. The first single from the album, &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;, became a hit in late 1991, reaching number one in Canada and number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States.

The album earned Cochrane four Juno Awards including Album of the Year, Single of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, and Songwriter of the Year. In addition, Cochrane won two SOCAN Awards and an ASCAP Award. &quot;Mad Mad World&quot; achieved a Diamond sales award in Canada for selling more than 1 million copies in Cochrane&#x27;s native Canada. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA for album sales of more than 500,000 copies in the United States.

The album also included the hits &quot;No Regrets&quot; (No. 3 &quot;RPM&quot; Charts), &quot;Sinking Like a Sunset&quot; (No. 2 &quot;RPM&quot; Charts), &quot;Washed Away&quot; (No. 7 &quot;RPM&quot; Charts), &quot;Bigger Man&quot; and the title track &quot;Mad Mad World&quot;. The album was produced by Joe Hardy and was recorded in Memphis, Tennessee and at three different Ontario studios: Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Hungry Hollow Studio in Georgetown and at Cochrane&#x27;s cabin in Oakville.

Upon the album&#x27;s initial releases in the US and Canada, the album featured two different album covers. The original album cover (designed by Ralph Alfonso) was on the initial Canadian release in 1991, while the alternate album cover was on the US release for the album in 1992. The alternate cover is now the main album cover for the album.

On October 28, 2016, Cochrane released an expanded 25th-anniversary edition of the album. Included on the expanded album is &quot;Love Is a Highway&quot;, the original demo version of the album&#x27;s first single, and a second disc featuring a concert recorded on May 14, 1992, on the Mad Mad World Tour in Chicago, Illinois.

<text>Caledonian MacBrayne (), in short form CalMac, is the trade name of CalMac Ferries Ltd, the major operator of passenger and vehicle ferries to the west coast of Scotland, serving ports on the mainland and 22 of the major islands. It is a subsidiary of holding company David MacBrayne, which is owned by the Scottish Government.

Its predecessor, the government owned Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd, was formed in 1973 as a ferry owner and operator. In 2006 these functions were separated to meet EU requirements for competitive tendering. The company, renamed Caledonian Maritime Assets (CMAL), continued to own the Caledonian MacBrayne fleet and assets. The contract for operating Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services using these vessels was put out to open competitive tender. and CalMac Ferries Ltd was created in October 2006 as a separate company to bid for the work. CalMac was awarded the contract, as well as a later competitive procurement process, and since 1 October 2007 has operated the services.

CalMac operates 36 ferries. A further 5 vessels are currently under construction for the fleet. The company serves over 50 ports and harbours on the west coast of Scotland, with CMAL owning 16 of these ports and harbours. Caledonian MacBrayne operate on average over 162,700 sailings annually. 2018 was the company&#x27;s busiest in terms of passenger numbers, carrying an estimated 5,309,771 passengers.

==History==

===David MacBrayne===

MacBrayne&#x27;s, initially known as David Hutcheson &amp; Co., began in 1851 as a private steamship operator when G. and J. Burns, operators of the largest of the Clyde fleets, decided to concentrate on coastal and transatlantic services and handed control of their river and Highland steamers to a new company in which Hutcheson, their manager of these services, became senior partner. One of the other partners was David MacBrayne (1817–1907), nephew of Messrs. Burns. In 1878, the company passed to David MacBrayne.

Their main route went from Glasgow down the Firth of Clyde through the Crinan Canal to Oban and Fort William, and on through the Caledonian Canal to Inverness. Services were later added to Islay and the Outer Hebrides. In 1928, the company ran into financial difficulties, and the business was acquired by Coast Lines and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS Railway). In 1948, the shares in the company owned by the LMS Railway passed to the British Transport Commission, thus partially nationalising it. In July 1969, Coast Lines&#x27; 50% shareholding passed into state ownership, so that the company became wholly nationalised, and all the shares were transferred to the state-owned Scottish Transport Group.

===Caledonian Steam Packet Company===

The Caledonian Railway at first used the services of various early private operators of Clyde steamers, then began operating steamers on its own account on 1 January 1889 to compete better with the North British Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway. It extended its line to bypass the G&amp;SW&#x27;s Prince&#x27;s Pier at Greenock and continue on to the fishing village of Gourock, where they had purchased the harbour.

After years of fierce competition between all the fleets, the Caledonian and G&amp;SW were merged in 1923 into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and their fleets were amalgamated into the Caledonian Steam Packet Company. Their funnels were painted yellow with a black top. At the same time, the North British Railway fleet became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (which built the in 1947). With nationalisation in 1948, the LMS and LNER fleets were amalgamated under British Railways with the name &quot;Clyde Shipping Services&quot;. In 1957, a reorganisation restored the CSP name, and in 1965 a red lion was added to each side of the black-topped yellow funnels. The headquarters remained at Gourock pierhead.

At the end of December 1968, management of the CSP passed to the Scottish Transport Group, which gained control of MacBrayne&#x27;s the following June. The MacBrayne service from Gourock to Ardrishaig ended on 30 September 1969, leaving the Clyde entirely to the CSP.

===Caledonian MacBrayne===
On 1 January 1973, the Caledonian Steam Packet Co. acquired most of the ships and routes of MacBrayne&#x27;s and commenced joint Clyde and West Highland operations under the new name of Caledonian MacBrayne, with a combined headquarters at Gourock. Funnels were now painted red with a black top, and a yellow circle at the side of the funnel featuring the red Caledonian lion. In 1974, a new car ferry service from Gourock to Dunoon was introduced with the ferries and .

In 1990, the ferry business was spun off as a separate company, keeping the Caledonian MacBrayne brand, and shares were issued in the company. All shares were owned by the state, first in the person of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and (after devolution) by the Scottish Government.

In 1996, CalMac opened its first route outside Scotland, winning a ten-year contract to provide a lifeline service to Rathlin Island in Northern Ireland. This service continued until 2008, when CalMac lost the tender.

A joint venture between Caledonian MacBrayne and the Royal Bank of Scotland named &quot;NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries&quot; won the tender for the subsidised Northern Isles services, previously run by P&amp;O Scottish Ferries, commencing in 2002. The ambitious programme ran into financial difficulties, and the service was again put out to tender. Caledonian MacBrayne won this tender, and formed a separate company called NorthLink Ferries Limited which began operating the Northern Isles ferry service on 6 July 2006.

===Restructuring – Caledonian Maritime Assets and CalMac Ferries Ltd===
Several groups have proposed privatising the service, and there has been a long commercial and political struggle with a privately owned company, Western Ferries, which has run a rival unsubsidised service from Gourock to Hunters Quay (near Dunoon) since 1973. To meet EU requirements for competitive tendering, the Scottish Executive put the collective &quot;Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services&quot; routes out to competitive tender in 2005. As part of this process the Dunoon route was put out as a separate tender. Some island and union groups opposed the tendering process, fearing it would lead to cuts in services and could be a prelude to full privatisation.

To enable competitive bidding on an equal basis, Caledonian MacBrayne was split into two separate companies on 1 October 2006. Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CMAL) retained ownership of CalMac vessels and infrastructure, including harbours, while CalMac Ferries Ltd submitted tenders to be the ferry operator. The company of David MacBrayne Ltd, which had been legally dormant for many years, was re-activated as a company wholly-owned by the Scottish Government on 4 July 2006. During September 2006, David MacBrayne Group Ltd acquired the entire share capital of CalMac Ferries Ltd. Thus, from leaving the hands of David MacBrayne 78 years earlier in 1928, the west coast ferry service returned to the fold in 2006, vastly enlarged. The David MacBrayne Group Ltd also cquired the full share capital of NorthLink Ferries, and took over operations of the NorthLink routes on 6 July 2006. A further subsidiary company - Rathlin Ferries Ltd - was established by David MacBrayne Group Ltd to operate the Rathlin to Ballycastle service in Northern Ireland.

Three operators submitted bids for the main block of routes, but CalMac retained all its existing routes. On 1 October 2007 CalMac Ferries Ltd began operating these services on a six-year contract. The Gourock to Dunoon service was the subject of a separate tender, but no formal bids were made. In an interim arrangement, CalMac Ferries Ltd continued to provide a subsidised service on this route, using the name Cowal Ferries. The Scottish Government subsequently decided not to subsidise a vehicle service on the Gourock–Dunoon route due to the existence of the rival Western Ferries vehicle service, and the route was put out to tender again, this time with subsidy available only for a passenger services to maintain a direct link between Gourock railway station and Dunoon town centre. In May 2011, Argyll Ferries Ltd, a newly formed subsidiary of David MacBrayne, was named as the preferred bidder for a passenger-only Dunoon-Gourock service. The timetable was extended into the early hours at weekends, with additional sailings integrated with rail services. Two passenger-only ferries, and (formerly MV &quot;Banrion Chonomara&quot;), were arranged for the run. When the service began on 30 June 2011, preparation of the &quot;Argyll Flyer&quot; was incomplete, and as an interim measure the cruise boat was leased from Clyde Cruises. Argyll Ferries was incorporated into Caledonian MacBrayne on 21 January 2019.

On 14 July 2009, it was announced that CalMac would begin Sunday sailings to Stornoway on Lewis from Sunday 19 July. These had historically faced strong opposition from Sabbatarian elements in the Lewis community, particularly the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society and the Free Church of Scotland. However, CalMac stated that EU equality legislation made it unlawful to refuse a service to the whole community because of the religious beliefs of a part of it.

NorthLink Ferries lost the contract for provision of the Northern Isles ferry services to Serco on 29 May 2012.

===COVID-19: Emergency lifeline timetable===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, CalMac operated a much reduced timetable. From 22 March 2020, they provided a turn up and go service to ensure essential goods and services were delivered to the islands. There were no reservations and no onboard retail facilities. Timetables were modified to meet local needs, with occasional additional crossings and extended layovers.

The Portavadie, Campbeltown and Armadale services were cancelled. Crossing frequencies were reduced on other routes, with single vessels at Rothesay, Largs and Kennacraig. On the smaller vessels, vehicle occupants were required to remain in their vehicle.

Until returned from dry dock in Liverpool, remained on the Uig triangle, with &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot; and providing services to Lochboisdale, Coll/Tiree and Colonsay from Oban. operated to Arran (22 April – 2 May) and Islay (27 May – 2 June) while and were out of service.

Unused vessels were laid up:
 in Campbeltown; at Craignure; , and at Sandbank; in Mallaig (covered Sound of Barra service while in Troon); and in Rothesay and in Troon.

===Post COVID===
In the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, the company began to struggle to maintain services due to an increasingly ageing fleet. The situation was exacerbated by long delays to the delivery of two new ferries for the Arran service ( and ), a situation dubbed by critics as the “ferry fiasco”. &quot;Glen Sannox&quot;, launched in 2017, was not handed over until November 2024, and entered service on 12 January 2025. &quot;Glen Rosa&quot; is expected to be delivered in September 2025, and a further four new ferries are expected to be delivered during the course of 2025.

In May 2024 Transport Scotland granted a contract extension to CalMac to continue to operate the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services until 30 September 2025.

==Service==

The company enjoys a de facto monopoly on the shipment of freight and vehicles to the islands, and competes for passenger traffic with a number of aircraft services of varying quality and reliability. Nonetheless, few if any of the routes currently operated by CalMac are profitable, and the company receives significant government subsidies due to its vital role in supplying the islands: these routes are classified as &quot;lifeline&quot; services.

Various versions of a local poem (based loosely on Psalm 24) refer to MacBrayne&#x27;s long dominance of Hebridean sailings:
===Routes===
===Passenger numbers===
==Fleet==

32 of the vessels operated by CalMac are owned by the asset holding company CMAL. Two ferries, and , are directly owned by CalMac, and a further two, and , are on charter from other owners.

Ten of the vessels can be categorised as &quot;major units&quot; – ships of or more in length. The largest is at in length. is almost long and able to carry 550 passengers with 88 cars. She was built in Poland at a cost of £24.5 million and operates the Islay service. The others are , , , , , and . The tenth &quot;major unit&quot;, , was handed over to CalMac on 21 November 2024, and entered full passenger service on the Troon - Brodick route on 13 January 2025.

There are 13 &quot;Loch Class&quot; vessels in different shapes and sizes. These double-ended ferries are mostly symmetrical when viewed from the side, with no operational bow or stern (although in official documents the designation of such is given). They generally serve shorter, more sheltered routes, although is able to handle Force 7 gales and carry 36 cars and 149 passengers, with a crew of five. , sometimes referred to as a &quot;super loch&quot;, entered service in 2007 on the Largs–Cumbrae route. &amp; are spare and relief vessels and are not assigned to any specific route.

Similar in outward appearance to the Loch Class vessels are the three diesel-electric ferries built by Ferguson Marine Engineering: (2013; for Raasay), (2013; for Tarbert) and (2015; for Lochranza).

A number of vessels have specific features and are designed for specific crossings. (2000) was designed for the Small Isles service, being fitted with a large stern vehicle ramp that allows her to berth a considerable distance from a slipway, protecting her exposed Azimuth thrusters in shallow waters. (2005) and (2007), both built in Gdańsk, work solely on the busy Wemyss Bay–Rothesay route. In 2022, a Norwegian ferry was purchased for the Mull service; after modification it entered service as . is a catamaran ferry owned by Pentland Ferries, currently on charter to CalMac for the Arran service. The smallest vessel in the fleet is , built in Shetland for the Kerrera route.

There are three passenger-only vessels in the fleet: , and . All operate on the Clyde. is leased from Clyde Marine Services for the Gourock to Kilcreggan service, whilst and operate the Gourock-Dunoon service.

===Future fleet===
The second of two dual fuel ferries for Arran constructed by Ferguson Marine Engineering, , is expected by September 2025.

A £91 million contract to build two ferries for the Islay service was awarded to Cemre Shipyard in Turkey in March 2022. The first steel for two ferries was cut at a ceremony in Turkey in October 2022, with the second vessel&#x27;s being done in January 2023, in the same week as the first vessel&#x27;s keel was laid. In May 2023, the same week as the second vessel&#x27;s keel was laid, it was announced that these ferries would be named and . &quot;Isle of Islay&quot; is expected to be delivered by the first quarter of 2025, with the second vessel following in the second quarter of 2025.
In October 2022 it was announced that two further vessels would be built to a very similar specification as the ferries under construction for Islay. CMAL signed a contract in January 2023 for Cemre Shipyard to also build the two ferries, which would allow a dedicated, peak season services to Tarbert and Lochmaddy from Uig and provide additional resilience in the fleet.
 The two vessels, and are expected to be delivered by the end of 2025.

<text>Rawkus Records (or Rawkus Entertainment) is an American hip hop record label, owned by James Murdoch, known for starting the careers of many rappers. Rawkus started in 1995 with releases in hip-hop, drum and bass and fun-dustrial (Dystopia One).

Label heads Brian Brater and Jarret Myer then signed some of the top underground talent from the New York area, notably Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Hi-Tek and Company Flow, who went on to define the label&#x27;s sound. The string of 12&quot; releases and full-length albums that followed helped initiate a resurgence in the New York/East Coast sound. Many of these are considered classics among hip-hop aficionados. During the mid to late 1990s, Rawkus became a dominant label in the underground hip-hop scene, producing a string of gold albums and a platinum album.

==History==
Rawkus Records was established in 1995 by Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, with financial backing from their high school friend James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. In 1996, Rupert Murdoch bought a majority of Rawkus. 
In 1999 the label entered into a distribution deal with Priority Records.

Over the years, Rawkus recorded several notable independent hip hop artists, including Reflection Eternal, Company Flow, the High and Mighty, Mos Def and Talib Kweli (as Blackstar), Eminem, Common, Pharoahe Monch and Skillz.

In 2000, Rawkus released New York City rapper Big L&#x27;s second and final studio album, &quot;The Big Picture&quot;. Released posthumously after Big L&#x27;s 1999 murder, the album debuted and peaked in the top 15 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. Anchored by the success of the single, &quot;Flamboyant&quot;, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA for selling over 500,000 copies in America.

In 2002, Rawkus signed a joint venture deal with MCA. Soon after, MCA folded and Interscope/Geffen bought Rawkus. After the sale of its catalog in 2004, Rawkus split from Geffen.

In 2006, Rawkus signed with RED (a Sony Music distribution company) and reemerged with a new line up of notable independent hip hop artists: The Procussions, Mr. J. Medeiros, Kidz in the Hall, Marco Polo, and Panacea.

In early 2007, Rawkus Records accepted album submissions from Hip Hop artists, known or unknown, to be considered for their new campaign. The 50 artists chosen to wear the Rawkus 50 badge were signed to a digital distribution deal through IODA&#x27;s (Independent Online Distribution Alliance) digital distribution network and had their albums released under the banner &quot;Rawkus 50 presents&quot;. The campaign was unsuccessful. Since 2007, Rawkus has not released a new project.

<text>Marc-André Hamelin, OC, OQ (born September 5, 1961) is a Canadian virtuoso pianist and composer who has received 11 Grammy Award nominations. He is on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music.

==Biography==

Born in Montreal, Quebec, Hamelin began his piano studies at the age of five. His father, a pharmacist who was also an amateur pianist, introduced him to the works of Charles-Valentin Alkan, Leopold Godowsky and Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji when he was still young. He studied at the École de musique Vincent-d&#x27;Indy in Montreal with Yvonne Hubert and then at Temple University in Philadelphia with Harvey Wedeen. In 1989, he received the Virginia Parker Prize.

Hamelin has given recitals in many cities. His festival appearances have included Bad Kissingen, Belfast, Cervantino, La Grange de Meslay, Husum Piano Rarities, Lanaudière, Ravinia, La Roque d’Anthéron, Ruhr Piano, Halifax (Nova Scotia), Singapore Piano, Snape Maltings Proms, Mänttä Music Festival, Turku and Ottawa Strings of the Future, as well as the Chopin Festivals of Bagatelle (Paris), Duszniki and Valldemossa. He appears regularly in both the Wigmore Hall Masterconcert Series and the International Piano Series at London’s South Bank Centre. He plays annually in the Herkulessaal in Munich and has given a series of recitals in Tokyo.

Hamelin has recorded a wide variety of composers&#x27; music with the Hyperion label. His recording of Leopold Godowsky&#x27;s complete &quot;Studies on Chopin&#x27;s Études&quot; won the 2000 Gramophone Magazine Instrumental Award. He is well known for his attention to lesser-known composers, especially of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Max Reger&#x27;s Piano Concerto, Leo Ornstein, Nikolai Roslavets, Georgy Catoire), and for performing works by pianist-composers Sophie-Carmen Eckhardt-Gramatté, Leopold Godowsky, Charles-Valentin Alkan, Kaikhosru Sorabji, Alexander Scriabin, Nikolai Kapustin, Franz Liszt, Nikolai Medtner and Frederic Rzewski.

Hamelin has also composed several works, including a set of piano études in all of the minor keys; completed in 2009, it was published by C. F. Peters, with a recording released on Hyperion. A cycle of seven pieces, &quot;Con Intimissimo Sentimento&quot;, was published (with a recording by Hamelin) by Ongaku No Tomo Sha; and a transcription of Zequinha de Abreu&#x27;s &quot;Tico-Tico No Fubá&quot; has been published by Schott Music. Although the majority of his compositions are for solo piano, he has also written three pieces for player piano (including the comical &quot;Circus Galop&quot;, &quot;Pop Music for Player Piano&quot; based upon &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;, and &quot;Solfeggietto a cinque&quot;, based on a theme by C.P.E. Bach), and several works for other instruments, including &quot;Fanfares&quot; for three trumpets, published by Presser. His other works are distributed by the Sorabji Archive.

In 1985, Hamelin won the Carnegie Hall International Competition for American Music; he made his recital debut at Carnegie Hall in 1988. In 2004, Hamelin received the international record award in Cannes. He has been made an Officer of the Order of Canada and a Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre national du Québec (National Order of Québec). He has won seven Juno Awards, most recently in 2012 for Classical Album of the Year: Solo or Chamber Ensemble, for his Liszt Piano Sonatas album.

==Critical appraisal==
Writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2000, senior critic Alex Ross said: &quot;Hamelin’s legend will grow—right now there is no one like him.&quot; Later in 2010, Ross added that Hamelin was ranked highly by piano connoisseurs, and &quot;admired for his monstrously brilliant technique and his questing, deep-thinking approach.&quot;

In 2015, Zachary Woolfe, classical music editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, noted Mr. Hamelin&#x27;s &quot;preternatural clarity and control, qualities that in him don’t preclude sensitivity [or] even poetry&quot;.

==Discography==
==Personal life==
Hamelin&#x27;s first marriage was to soprano Jody Karin Applebaum. He currently lives in Boston, Massachusetts, with his second wife Cathy Fuller, a pianist and WGBH classical music broadcaster. Hamelin has Type 1 diabetes.

<text>Willard Harrison Bennett (June 13, 1903 – September 28, 1987) was an American scientist and inventor, born in Findlay, Ohio. Bennett conducted research into plasma physics, astrophysics, geophysics, surface physics, and physical chemistry. The Bennett pinch is named after him.

==Biography==
Born in Findlay, Ohio, Bennett attended Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1920 to 1922 and Ohio State University; the University of Wisconsin, Sc.M. in physical chemistry, 1926; and the University of Michigan, Ph.D. in physics, 1928. Bennett was elected to a National Research Fellowship in Physics and in 1928 and 1929 studied at the California Institute of Technology. In 1930 he joined the Physics faculty at Ohio State. During the World War II era, he served as an officer in the United States Army and developed aircraft equipment. Following military service, Bennett worked at the National Bureau of Standards, the University of Arkansas, and the United States Naval Research Laboratory. In 1961, he was appointed Burlington Professor of Physics at North Carolina State University (emeritus in 1976). Bennett held 67 patents.

Bennett made scientific history in the 1930s pioneering studies in plasma physics, the study of gases ionized by high-voltage electricity. Bennett invented radio frequency mass spectrometry in (1955). Bennett&#x27;s radio-frequency mass spectrometer measured the masses of atoms. It was the first such experiment in space. He also researched gases ionized by high-voltage electricity. This research was used in later thermonuclear fusion research.

==Invention impact==
These studies and later research have been used throughout the world in controlled thermonuclear fusion research. In the 1950s, Bennett&#x27;s experimental tube called the Stormertron predicted and modeled the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the Earth six years before they were discovered by satellite. It also reproduced intricate impact patterns found on the Earth&#x27;s surface which explained many features of the polar aurora. Sputnik 3 carried the first radio frequency mass spectrometer into space.

<text>In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy role-playing game, dragons are an iconic type of monstrous creature. As a group, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; dragons are loosely based on dragons from a wide range of fictional and mythological sources. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; allows players to fight the fictional dragons in the game (Tiamat being one of the most notable) and &quot;slay their psychic dragons&quot; as well. These dragons, specifically their &quot;dungeon ecology&quot;, have implications for the literary theory of fantasy writing. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; dragons also featured as targets of the moral panic surrounding the game.

In &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, dragons are depicted as any of various species of large, intelligent, magical, reptilian beasts, each typically defined by a combination of their demeanor and either the color of their scales or their elemental affinity. For example, a commonly presented species of dragon is the red dragon, which is named for its red scales, and known for its evil and greedy nature, as well as its ability to breathe fire. In the game, dragons are usually adversaries of player characters, and less commonly, allies or helpers.

== Overview ==
Powerful and intelligent, the fictional dragons of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; are usually reptiles with magical abilities and breath weapons. The different sub-species, distinguished by their coloring, vary in power.

Despite the variety of dragons in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, a number of traits are common to nearly all types of dragons. All species are portrayed as generally reptilian or serpentine in their natural form. Except for the youngest dragons, they are described as quite large—usually at least as big as a horse, and often much larger. Most species are depicted to have wings and be capable of flight, and nearly all are quadrupedal. Almost all species of dragon are depicted as highly intelligent (at least as intelligent as a human being) and are able to speak. All species of dragon are noted to be magical in nature, and in most species this nature is expressed as an affinity for some type of elemental power. Some dragon species are naturally able to cast magical spells as well. Most dragons in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; have the ability to breathe or expel one or more types of energy associated with their elemental affinity, as well as to resist some damage or injury from other sources of such energy. Some dragons have two different kinds of breath weapons, usually one that can cause physical harm to player characters (fire, ice, acid, lightning, etc.) and another that typically has a non-damaging effect (paralysis, repulsion, confusion, etc.).

Dragons are noted to be egg-layers, and most are described with sharp teeth, horns, and claws. A dragon in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; is protected by its scaly hide, the color of which is determined by the dragon&#x27;s species, and which offers a visual clue to the specific elemental nature of each species of dragon. Each species of dragon has a particular temperament associated with it, as well as a moral outlook derived from that temperament; these factors underlie the personality and behavior of individual dragons. While dragons typically are not portrayed with wide variances in appearance or personality within a species, exceptions are possible, especially in certain in-game settings, such as Eberron.

Because dragons in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; are portrayed as monstrous creatures designed to antagonize player characters, the majority of dragons in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; are described as evil by default. This was more prominent in the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; releases (such as the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;white box&quot; set (1974) and Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set) where only the gold dragon was specified to be lawful good while all other colors were noted to be chaotic evil (red, green, black) or neutral evil (blue, white).

Detailed information about dragonkind in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th editions of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; may be found in their respective editions of the &quot;Draconomicon&quot;, a supplement book designed to provide players with more information about dragons; fifth edition has the similarly-themed &quot;Fizban&#x27;s Treasury of Dragons&quot;. No such book was published for the first edition, although the Basic game had a &quot;Bestiary of Dragons and Giants&quot; (coded AC10).

=== Origins ===
Medieval literature scholar Thomas Honegger considered it &quot;no coincidence&quot; that the seminal role-playing game &quot;features the dragon, a most formidable opponent, as the second element of its name&quot; as the &quot;recognition of the dragon as the most dangerous animal is traditional&quot; in epic literature.

Five evil-aligned dragons (white dragon, black dragon, green dragon, blue dragon, and red dragon), and the lawful-good aligned golden dragon (in ascending order of magic power and capabilities) first appeared in the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;white box&quot; set (1974). The Greyhawk Campaign supplement (1975) added the copper dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, and silver dragon, along with the Platinum Dragon (Bahamut) and the Chromatic Dragon (Tiamat). &quot;Dragon&quot; was one of the protected terms from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien involved in a lawsuit between rights holder Saul Zaentz and TSR in 1977.

The white dragon, black dragon, red dragon and brass dragon reappeared in the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; (1977). The six dragons from the 1974 boxed set appeared in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rulebook&quot; (1981), and again in the 1983 version of the &quot;Basic Set&quot; (1983). These six appeared along with the gemstone dragons (crystal dragon, onyx dragon, jade dragon, sapphire dragon, ruby dragon and amber dragon), and the dragon rulers (Pearl (the Moon Dragon), Ruler of all Chaotic Dragons; Diamond (the Star Dragon), Ruler of all Lawful Dragons; Opal (the Sun Dragon), Ruler of all Neutral Dragons; and the Great One, Ruler of All Dragonkind) in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia&quot; (1991).

The five chaotic-aligned dragon types from the 1974 boxed set, as well as the gold dragon and the four new dragon types from the &quot;Greyhawk&quot; supplement (the copper dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, and silver dragon) appeared in first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in the original &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977), along with Bahamut and Tiamat. The former five dragon types were given as evil-aligned, while the latter five dragon types were given as good-aligned. The ten dragon types were given pseudoscientific names as follows: black (&quot;draco causticus sputem&quot;), blue (&quot;draco electricus&quot;), brass (&quot;draco impudentus gallus&quot;), bronze (&quot;draco gerus bronzo&quot;), copper (&quot;draco comes stabuli&quot;), gold (&quot;draco orientalus sino dux&quot;), green (&quot;draco chlorinous nauseous respiratorus&quot;), red (&quot;draco conflagratio horriblis&quot;), silver (&quot;draco nobilis argentum&quot;), and white (&quot;draco rigidus frigidus&quot;). 

The Oriental dragons appeared in the original &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (1981), including the li lung (earth dragon), the lung wang (sea dragon), the pan lung (coiled dragon), the shen lung (spirit dragon), the t&#x27;ien lung (celestial dragon), and the yu lung (carp dragon). The cloud dragon, the faerie dragon, the mist dragon, and the shadow dragon appeared in the original &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; (1983).

=== Second edition ===
In the second edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;), dragons were altered heavily from their first edition equivalents and were made much more powerful with magic resistance, removing the subdual rules, and now had more physical attack forms besides claws and bites. &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition and &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd edition divided true dragons further into three main categories: &quot;chromatic dragons&quot; which are evil-aligned; &quot;metallic dragons&quot; which are good; and neutral-aligned &quot;gem dragons&quot;, rare creatures that possess psionic abilities. In addition, there were other subspecies of true dragons that did not fit into the three main categories. For example, mercury and steel dragons would seem to be metallic dragons, but in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; world they are considered to be outside of the main family of metallic dragons because of various biological differences (though the book &quot;Dragons of Faerûn&quot; did list them as metallic dragons). The &quot;lung dragons&quot; or spirit-dragons of &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; are also true dragons.

The black dragon, blue dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, green dragon, red dragon, silver dragon, and white dragon appeared in second edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume One&quot; (1989). The faerie dragon, and the Oriental dragons—lung wang (sea dragon), pan lung (coiled dragon), shen lung (spirit dragon), t&#x27;ien lung (celestial dragon), tun mi lung (typhoon dragon), yu lung (carp dragon), chiang ling (river dragon), and li lung (earth dragon)—appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Forgotten Realms Appendix&quot; (1989). The radiant dragon appeared in the &quot;&quot; boxed set (1989). 

The dragons of Krynn&#x27;, the , the astral dragon, the , the , and the sea dragon appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Dragonlance Appendix (1990)&quot;. The cloud dragon, the Greyhawk dragon, the mist dragon, and the shadow dragon appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Greyhawk Appendix&quot; (1990). The adamantite dragon appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix&quot; (1991). The moon dragon, the sun dragon, and the stellar dragon appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Spelljammer Appendix&quot; (1991). The deep dragon appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Forgotten Realms Appendix II&quot; (1991). 

The gem dragons (the amethyst dragon, the crystal dragon, the emerald dragon, the sapphire dragon, and the topaz dragon) first appeared in &quot;The Dragon&quot; magazine #037 (May 1980), and then appeared again in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix&quot; (1992). The chromatic dragons (black dragon, blue dragon, green dragon, red dragon, and white dragon), the gem dragons (amethyst dragon, crystal dragon, emerald dragon, sapphire dragon, and topaz dragon), metallic dragons (brass dragon, bronze dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, and silver dragon), brown dragon, cloud dragon, deep dragon, mercury dragon, mist dragon, shadow dragon, steel dragon, and yellow dragon appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993). The onyx dragon, jade dragon, ruby dragon and amber dragon appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Mystara Appendix&quot; (1994).

=== Third edition ===
The chromatic dragons (black, blue, green, red, and white), and the metallic dragons (brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver) appeared in the third edition in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2000), and in the revised 3.5 &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2003). The Gem dragons appeared in the third edition in the &quot;Monster Manual II&quot;.

The third edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; classifies dragon as a type of creature, simply defined as &quot;a reptilelike creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual abilities&quot;. The dragon type is broken down into several classifications. True dragons are dragons which increase in power by age categories (wyrmling to great wyrm). Lesser dragons do not improve in age categories and may lack all of the abilities of true dragons. Examples of lesser dragons include dragon turtles and wyverns. Other creatures with the dragon type include drakes, , elemental drakes, landwyrms, linnorms and wurms.

=== Fourth edition ===
With &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 4th edition, the classifications were changed: chromatic dragons turned not strictly evil, and metallic dragons proved not necessarily good. Also, there are several new categories (although the gem dragons did not return): &quot;planar dragons&quot; which are defined as dragons that were warped by living on a plane of existence other than the Material Plane, &quot;catastrophe dragons&quot;, which take on the aspects of natural disasters which are chaotic evil and cause chaos for its own sake, and &quot;scourge dragons&quot;.

The five chromatic dragon types (black, blue, green, red, and white) appeared in young, adult, elder, and ancient variants in the fourth edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2008). Chromatic dragons were again presented in the &quot;Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons&quot;. This supplement also included three more chromatic dragon types: the brown dragon (aka, sand dragon), the grey dragon (aka, fang dragon), and the purple dragon (aka, deep dragon). The adamantine dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, iron dragon, and silver dragon appeared in the &quot;Monster Manual 2&quot; (2009). Metallic dragons are presented in the &quot;Monster Manual 2&quot; and &quot;Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons&quot;. Catastrophe dragons are presented in &quot;Monster Manual 3&quot;. Planar dragons have been presented in both &quot;Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons&quot; and &quot;Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons&quot;.

=== Fifth edition ===
The five basic chromatic dragons (red, blue, green, black, and white) and metallic dragons (copper, brass, silver, gold, and bronze) appeared in the fifth edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2014) in wyrmling, young, adult, and ancient. Gem dragons and other new-to-fifth-edition dragons appeared in &quot;Fizban&#x27;s Treasury of Dragons&quot; (2021).

== Game mechanics ==
In &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, true dragons continue to become more powerful as they mature and age; they grow bigger and stronger, become more resistant to damage and magic, their breath weapon become increasingly dangerous and their knowledge and magical abilities improves. Old dragons can cast &quot;draconic magic&quot; which is a special form of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; magic; dragons can cast spells with just a few words, rather than a sometimes long and complex ritual involving words, gestures and preparations like other &quot;D&amp;D&quot; wizards. In 3 and 3.5 editions dragons cast spells spontaneously like sorcerers do, sometimes having a wider choice of spells. Dragons also radiate a mystical &quot;fear aura&quot; around them. After a millennium or two, a dragon reaches their maximum development.

Many &quot;D&amp;D&quot; dragons have some innate magical abilities, but they vary from race to race. Metallic dragons are often able to shapechange into small animals or human forms, and use this ability to secretly help or watch over humans. Dragons also have some innate powers over the element they are linked to. For example, a red dragon (fire) will have some control over fires. Like all other draconic powers, they gain more as they grow older. Lesser dragons (such as wyverns, halfdragons or dragonwrought kobolds) may lack innate magical abilities, while still counting as dragons for purpose of all other effects.

===Breath weapon===

A breath weapon is the cone or line shaped weapon exhaled by dragons in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. Each type of dragon has a different breath weapon. The chromatic dragons have one breath weapon and the metallic dragons have two. Other dragons and semi-dragons frequently have breath weapons. One example is the dragon turtle&#x27;s cone of steam breath weapon.

====Form====

Breath weapons typically come in one of three forms.
* Line: Does damage in a straight line.
* Cone: Does damage in a wide cone shape.
* Cloud: Does damage with a cloud of gas.

====Composition====

Breath weapons typically are composed of one of several materials (gem dragons may have breath weapons of other materials, such as psychic energy and thunderous bursts of sound).
* Fire: Magical fire is used by gold dragons, brass dragons and red dragons.
* Electricity: Lightning is exhaled by blue dragons and bronze dragons.
* Acid: The black and copper dragon exhale a powerful acid.
* Poison: The green dragon&#x27;s breath weapon is a cloud of chlorine gas.
* Cold: The white and silver dragons both release a cone of sub zero air and ice.

=== Magic ===
True dragons are born with a natural flair for magic, but they need to practice and hone their skills and come of age before they are able to use it to any meaningful effect.

== Fictional traits ==

=== Biology ===
Dragons are inherently magical beings, and are, contrary to appearances, not reptilian in nature. All true dragons are endothermic, with its body temperature varying based on their age and species. However, unlike a most endothermic creatures, dragons have no way of shedding excess heat; instead, the heat is extracted via an organ known as the draconis fundamentum, where it is transformed into energy for the creature. A dragon is also unaffected by a lack of external heat, without slowing their metabolism nor activity level.

The number of eggs laid each time depends on the race of the dragon, but is usually low (between one and ten). Dragons can also cross-breed with virtually any other creature, creating a half-dragon. The most commonly heard of are in the humanoid races, particularly with human and elves. Nearly any combination is possible, even with devils or angels.

While varying depending on species, dragon senses are often superior in most ways to other creatures; like any predator, they have exceptionally acute senses, which only increase with age. Like avian creatures, they have excellent depth perception and comparingly good peripheral vision, able to see twice as well as a human in daylight; unlike avian, they have great night vision, and are able to see even when conditions have no light to offer, although in such conditions they cannot discern between colors.

=== Behavior ===
All true dragons in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; are depicted as intelligent beings, and most of them exceedingly so. A dragon&#x27;s personality varies by individual, but dragons of the same subrace tend to have similar mindsets. This is not always true; several exceptions exist in official &quot;D&amp;D&quot; material. Dragon subraces encompass all &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; alignments, going from lawful good paladin-like gold dragons to the cruel and very greedy chaotic evil red dragons.

All dragons share a common desire to collect treasure, be it precious, beautiful, magical or just shiny—indeed, the treasure in question needn&#x27;t always be gold, and may sometimes be aesthetic in nature, ranging from popular artwork or sculptures or even rare books and tomes that might otherwise have an overwhelming monetary value. For evil-aligned dragons, this generally directs a greedy attitude to achieve such wealth by whatever means suit them. For good dragons this lust for treasure is tempered, although they are certainly not averse to earning such wealth, and still appreciate gifts (while being insulted if offered an obvious bribe).

Being stronger, faster, generally smarter, and possessing longer life than humans and most other races, dragons tend to consider themselves superior creatures. For good-aligned dragons, this may only mean they often consider humanoid races as children, trying to take care of them and educate them; for evil-aligned dragons, they consider humanoids as mere animals, or as toys to play with; at best, they are minions and slaves, while at worst, they are the dragon&#x27;s next dinner.

The longevity of dragons is evident in their often lackadaisical attitudes. Good-aligned dragons, while concerned with defeating evil, are able to see a much broader scope of the world, and although certain crises arise that may seem extremely important to good-aligned humans, their dragon counterparts are able to see the event as an unimportant hiccup that will pass in mere centuries; even those that adventure with others tend show a sense of incredible patience, even in situations where all others feel they&#x27;ve not a second to lose. Similarly, evil-aligned dragons that are crossed by belligerent adventurers may plot for dozens of generations before exacting revenge on the trespasser&#x27;s line—it is not uncommon for those descended from the mentioned adventurer to find themselves the target of a dragon based simply on their lineage.

== In campaign settings ==
In many settings, the god-king of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, and the goddess and queen of the chromatic dragons is Tiamat, the Five-Headed Dragon. She is based on the Tiamat from Babylonian mythology, who was considered the evil mother of dragons, though the appearances of the fictional deity differs greatly from its model.

The progenitor and supreme deity of all dragons in the game is known as Io. Other deities often included in the draconic pantheon of gods include Aasterinian, Chronepsis, and Faluzure. Other draconic gods may be present in different campaign settings.

=== Dragonlance setting ===
The &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels and campaign setting, which had the idea of &quot;a world were dragons dominated&quot; as a core concept of its development, helped popularize the &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-derived perspective on dragons. Here the Platinum Dragon is called Paladine, and the Dragon Queen is called Takhisis. Dragons are divided up into good and evil groups, known as the Metallic Dragons and the Chromatic Dragons, respectively. Paladine leads the Metallic Dragons and Takhisis the Chromatic. The Metallic Dragons rarely became involved in the world other than to oppose the actions of Chromatic Dragons, who often joined into war as their goddess Takhisis instructed. However, in the &quot;Fifth Age&quot;, massive Chromatic Dragons who were not native to Krynn emerged and took over many of the humanoid-controlled nations of Krynn, as well as slaying many of the native dragons. They are known as Dragon Overlords. There was one from each race of Chromatic Dragons; red, green, black, white, and blue.

=== Dark Sun setting ===
In the world of Athas of the Dark Sun campaign setting, normal D&amp;D dragons do not exist. Dragon-like &quot;drake&quot; races exist, one for each classical element, but for most people the word &quot;dragon&quot; refers to the Dragon of Tyr, who is a very powerful &quot;sorcerer-king&quot; (the tyrannic leaders of Athasian cities, who are both masters of magic and psi abilities) who transformed himself into a dragon-like creature using very powerful (and painful) magic. However, this dragon (Bors or Borys) was eventually killed in Troy Denning&#x27;s book &quot;The Cerulean Storm&quot; by his former master, the sorcerer Rajaat. Several other sorcerer kings had been rumored to be dragons, but all others were only in a process of being transformed into a dragon type being, unique to the Athas world, which took several long stages to complete, but became greatly powerful if achieved.

=== Forgotten Realms setting ===
In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting, dragons are very close to the ones in Dragonlance. A sect of cultists called the &quot;Cult of the Dragon&quot; believes that dragons, particularly undead ones, will rule the world, and are trying to persuade evil dragons to become &quot;dracoliches&quot;—undead lich-like dragons, which are partially bound to the cult by the rituals which grant them their undead status. Additionally, in the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; supplement book &quot;The Draconomicon&quot;, several other undead varieties of the dragon – ghost, skeleton, vampire, and zombie dragons – are described.

A series called Wyrms of the North ran in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine issues #230 through #259 and was later updated to third edition rules on Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s website (see external links). Each article detailed an individual dragon of significance in Faerûn.

Lately an ancient affliction that attacks dragons, rendering them mad; the Dracorage, was invoked causing countless dragons to rampage throughout Faerûn. A novel trilogy, &quot;The Year of Rogue Dragons&quot; set (&quot;The Rage&quot;, &quot;The Rite&quot;, and &quot;The Ruin&quot;) by Richard Lee Byers, as well as a game accessory, &quot;Dragons of Faerûn&quot;, details the exploits and deeds of several dragons as the Dracorage swept the continent.

=== World of Greyhawk setting ===
Steel dragons, originally known as Greyhawk dragons, are those originating in the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; campaign setting, later appearing in other settings like the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. They have hair-like spines around their heads, cat-like bodies with vaguely human-like faces, and scales resembling steel armor. They are much like the other races of metallic dragon with one primary exception: they prefer to maintain the form of another sentient race in order to mingle with, infiltrate, and study the cultures of men and their ilk. Few people know when they are interacting with a Steel Dragon, but they always have a feature which betrays them by resembling their natural complexion. Within the Greyhawk setting, such dragons are known to have made journeys into other material planes where they have come to be called steel dragons.

=== Council of Wyrms setting ===
The &quot;Council of Wyrms&quot; campaign setting is the only one that allows for dragon player characters in its base rules. (The &quot;Draconomicon&quot; introduces rules for dragon PCs in standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.) The setting is based around a society of dragons and their servitors and uses the standard &quot;D&amp;D&quot; dragon races and dragon gods. It has detailed rules for creating and playing dragon PCs and NPCs, including various draconic character classes.

=== Eberron setting ===
In the &quot;Eberron&quot; campaign setting, three dragon gods have created the world: Siberys, Eberron and Khyber. Siberys and Eberron waged war against Khyber and imprisoned it within the depths of the earth. In the end, all three dragons merged with the land: Siberys becoming the sky, Eberron the continents and Khyber the underground world.

Dragons are apart from civilization, which is mostly concentrated on the continent of Khorvaire. They live on the continent of Argonnessen, a rather unknown place, since dragons are very territorial, it makes exploration often hazardous. The dragons used to rule over Eberron many centuries ago, but at the end of the Dragon-Fiend war, against the demons and devils of Khyber, they departed from Khorvaire to go to Argonnessen.

Dragons are immersed in the Draconic Prophecy, a legend which all bits of information are scattered throughout the world and that the outcome is unknown. They see every event as an important event in the Prophecy, and they even form an organization called the Chamber, where they send their brethren in search of clues. They can be of any alignment, like any creature in Eberron, so a good red dragon (usually evil) is as common as an evil gold dragon (usually good). This rule might throw some players off-balance. Dragons also consider themselves superior, treating all other races as inferior. Furthermore, any half-dragon spotted by these dragons is vowed to be hunted, as they treat these half-breeds as a disgrace to their image.

=== Birthright setting ===
The Birthright campaign setting had its own version of a Dragon, named Cerilian Dragon, Cerilia being the main continent in the setting. They resemble more the eastern-type dragons being long and serpentine with leathery wings. Their backs are protected by iron-hard scales, their bellies by layers of thick, leathery skin. Their color ranges from reddish rust-brown to iron gray, with their bellies usually of a paler tone than their scales. Cerilian dragons are among the most ancient inhabitants of the continent, predating even elves and dwarves. Perhaps once there were many, but over the years, in-fighting and fighting the younger races have taken their toll. There are only a half dozen dragons known to be left. All living dragons are of the Old age or higher. Dragons are extremely intelligent and knowledgeable, conserving much lore that has been lost to the younger races. They speak their own language; some also speak Elven or Dwarven. Some of these dragons took part in the Battle of Deismaar, the only verified alive and awake dragons right now are the dragon of Vstaive Peaks in Vosgaard, also known as Vore Lekiniskiy and Kappenkriaucheran who inhabits the Drachenward mountains and controls their magic. The most famous of the dragons is Tarazin the Grey who has not been seen for several decades when the official campaign begins. The only known Dracolich is Komassa who lives in the Shadow World. Dragons in Birthright are meant to be rare and powerful beings and only rarely if ever appear in any adventure.

==Chromatic dragons==
Chromatic dragon is a classification of fictional dragon. Chromatic dragons are typically of evil alignment, in contrast to the metallic dragons, which are typically of good alignment. Chromatic dragons have played a large role in various &quot;D&amp;D&quot; monster compilation books: white, black, green, blue and red dragons being the classic chromatic dragons. Tiamat is the queen of chromatic dragons, based on the evil mother of all dragons from Babylonian mythology.

===Publication history===
The classification of &quot;chromatic dragons&quot; was used in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; second edition &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993), although the dragons comprising the category had been in print since the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;white box&quot; set (1974). The term continued to be used in the third, fourth and fifth editions of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;.

The German magazine &quot;Envoyer&quot; commented that the artistic rendering of dragons in the game evolved positively through the editions, giving the different races more distinctive characteristics aside from color.

===Red dragon===
Red dragons are the largest and most powerful of the classic chromatic dragons. They are large with a wide wingspan. They have two swept back horns on their heads. Once they hatch, the wyrmlings are left to fend for themselves. A red wyrmling is roughly human-sized at hatching and dangerous. They are capable of breathing fire, and revel in wreaking destruction and havoc on almost anything that moves. The latter trait is carried fully into adulthood. They regard all other Chromatic dragons as inferiors, with the amount of disdain proportional to the variety&#x27;s general power level. All other chromatic dragons that red dragons encounter are either killed, driven away, or bullied into servitude depending on the red dragon&#x27;s mood and personality, with the except of white dragons who are allowed to leave since red dragons do not consider them worth the effort to kill. 

Due to their choice of living space they cross paths with many of the metallic dragons, most notably the silver dragons who are their worst enemies, and holding the greatest disdain for copper dragons with whom they often clash. Red dragons have an eye for value, and can determine the monetary worth of any object at a glance. The gaining and keeping of treasure is the focus of a red dragon&#x27;s adult life, and they tend to amass incredible hoards with amazing rapidity. Red dragons prefer to make their homes inside active volcanoes. If a volcano is not available, they will reside in any mountain, provided that it has a good ledge from which the dragon can survey its territory. A red dragon&#x27;s lair may have only one entrance, high above ground level. 

Red dragons are very dangerous in combat. Proficient in magic, they are also fast in the air, but clumsy, so prefer to fight on the ground. They spend years designing battle strategies, and wait until the best moment to call upon them. Their blasts of fire end most battles before they begin.

The red dragon Themberchaud, which first appeared in &quot;Drizzt Do’Urden’s Guide to the Underdark&quot; (1999) and reappeared in subsequent modules such as &quot;Out of the Abyss&quot; (2015), was featured in the live-action film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot; (2023).

David M. Ewalt described ancient red dragons&#x27; place in the game as &quot;there are few beasts more powerful&quot;.

===Blue dragon===
Blue dragons are the second most powerful of the classic chromatic dragons. They have single large horns protruding from their heads and large, frilled ears. The tail is thick and bumpy. The wings are more pronounced than most other species.

They are more likely to be mocking and manipulative than out rightly cruel or murderous to &#x27;lesser&#x27; creatures, aided by their natural talents for hallucination. They trick desert travelers into drinking sand or going miles out of their way. Blue dragons are mostly carnivorous though they will eat plants on occasion. Camels are the preferred food. They are enemies of brass dragons. 

Blue dragons are unusual for chromatics in that they keep fairly well-ordered, hierarchical societies. Despite their evil nature, they are excellent parents to their young, and rarely leave their eggs unattended. Blue wyrmlings are quick to taunt any other creature. They hunt small desert creatures for food. The typical blue dragon lair is dug into desert rock formations with two entrances: one at ground level, hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it can perch and survey its territory. Each lair also has a cavern with a pool of water and sandy beach, which its inhabitant will use for drinking and relaxation. 

The blue dragon excels at aerial combat. They discharge lightning at aerial foes, or at creatures on the ground. They are powerful at spell craft and adept at burrowing in sand. They often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they are so burrowed, their large horns can be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.

===Green dragon===
Green dragons are the third most powerful of the classic chromatic dragons. They have a large, waving crest or fin that starts at the dragon&#x27;s nose and runs the length of the dragon&#x27;s body. They also have long, slender forked tongues. They are highly adept at magic. 

Green dragons are reasonably good parents, with both mother and father typically staying close to their eggs while they are incubating. The green wyrmling may be mistaken for a black, due to their nearly black scales. As the wyrmling matures, its scales lighten in color. The wyrmlings typically stay with both parents until they reach adulthood. 

A green dragon lair will be a complex of caves and tunnels, with its main entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The dragons prefer caves high up on a cliff. The territories of Green and Black dragons frequently overlap, but as greens are more powerful, they typically hold the upper hand. Greens may allow a Black dragon to remain in their forest, as long as the lesser dragon remains in the swamps. 

Green dragons revel in combat, and will often attack for no apparent reason. They are territorial, and may view any intrusion into their domain as an affront. They are cunning and duplicitous foes, and love to double-cross. A traveler who stumbles into a green dragon&#x27;s territory may be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but the dragon may pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard is down. Though aggressive, green dragons prefer to use magic before attacking physically.

===Black dragon===
Black dragons are the most vile-tempered and cruel of all chromatic dragons, apart from their love of bargaining. Black dragons are distinguished by their horns, which protrude from the sides of their heads and wrap around, projecting forward, a longer body and thinner tail. A large frill adorns the upper part of the neck. 

Black dragons are fierce hunters that will normally attack from the water. They will often prey on fish, crabs, birds, turtles, crocodiles, lizardfolk, chuuls, hydras, and green dragons that are smaller and younger than they are. Their enemies include green dragons and swamp landwyrms. Black dragons are not noted as good parents. Their wyrmlings (babies) are exceptionally cruel with insatiable appetites for nearly anything organic. As a black dragon matures, its scales gradually grow lighter. The oldest black dragons appear almost purple in color; hence the name of Cormyr&#x27;s Purple Dragon knights stems from the legend of the great black dragon Thauglor, who once dominated the area encompassed by the present kingdom. 

A black dragon typically lairs in a large cave or underground chamber next to a swamp or murky pond. Their lairs always have two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp/pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth. In combat, black dragons prefer ambushes to straightforward fighting. They are vicious and ruthless adversaries, and their acidic bile can easily work its way under the heaviest armor. Their heavily wooded habitats prevent them from flying very high in combat.

===White dragon===
White dragons are the weakest and the most feral of the classic chromatic dragons. Though dimmer than other dragons, they are still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and have good long-term memories. Their heads and necks blend seamlessly into one another, and their wings are frayed along the edges. They have a flap of skin (dewlap) lined with spines under their chins. They have a high crest atop a streamlined head. 

A newly hatched white wyrmling has clear scales, which become white as the dragon matures. They are expected to survive on their own after hatching, although some white dragon parents will permit their young to live in their lair until they reach adulthood. Adult white dragons have several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat. They can climb ice cliffs with ease, fly high and fast, and are exceptional swimmers. They love to swim in cold water. Much of their diet consists of aquatic creatures. White dragons are always hungry, and tend to become more savage as they mature. 

Knowing that they are the smallest and weakest of dragons, many whites harbor inferiority complexes. They take any opportunity to bully beings such as giants and younger dragons of other species. White dragons lair in ice caves dug into mountains. Their lairs contain many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. White dragons are not strong combatants compared to other dragons. Their icy breath can freeze a foe solid. They avoid fights with more powerful dragons. Whites also have exceptional memories, and will hunt down those who cross them, no matter how long it takes.

===Other chromatic dragons===
This is a list of other dragons which are based on colors, but are not truly related to other chromatic dragons. In 4th edition, the gray, brown, and purple dragons were released in the &quot;Draconomicon&quot;, but the grey and purple dragons were different. Instead of being based on the dragons listed here, they were based on the fang and deep dragons of 3rd edition.
===Reception===
The young adult black dragon was ranked first among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons For Dummies&quot;. The young white dragon was ranked eighth among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons For Dummies&quot;. The authors chose the young white dragon over a wyrmling, feeling that &quot;it&#x27;s more satisfying for characters to battle against a dragon that&#x27;s at least as big as a person, if not bigger. The young white dragon offers the best chance for this kind of fight&quot;. Dant &quot;et al.&quot; called the red dragon &quot;deadly&quot;, and &quot;one of the most fearsome and classic monsters&quot; in role-playing games.

== Metallic dragons ==
Metallic dragon is a classification of dragon found in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. In many campaign settings, metallic dragons are of good alignment. Bahamut is the deity of good-aligned dragons and metallic dragons, and currently the only known Platinum dragon in existence. Metallic dragons have played a large role in D&amp;D&#x27;s various monster compilation books, and for most of the game&#x27;s history five main types – brass, copper, bronze, silver, and gold – were presented as roughly analogous to the five types of chromatic dragons. The fourth edition of the game&#x27;s second &quot;Monster Manual&quot; substituted iron and adamantine dragons for brass and bronze, and released the latter dragons in a later book alongside cobalt, mercury, mithral, orium, and steel dragons.

=== Publication history ===
The classification of &quot;metallic dragons&quot; was used in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; second edition &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993), although the gold(en) dragon first appeared in the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;white box&quot; set (1974) and the other dragons comprising the category had been in print since the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977). The term was continued in use in the third edition, fourth, and fifth edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot;.

=== Brass dragon ===

Although weaker than many other varieties of dragonkind, brass dragons are still powerful creatures by any measure. They have a strong mercenary streak and often agree to serve as guardians or battle champions for anyone willing to pay suitably well. Ancient brass dragons are some of the best – and most willing – sources of advice in the entire Prime Material Plane.

Physically, the brass dragon is highly distinctive. From below, its outstretched wings form a triangular shape, as they are attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings are longest at the shoulder and taper gently as they reach the tail. Their scales seem to radiate heat and light. The shape of the head is quite unusual, as it includes a large, curved plate that extends from the dragon&#x27;s eyes and cheeks on either side and curves upwards into two points, much like a plowshare. They have two sharp horns on the chin, which become steadily pointier as the dragon ages. They smell like hot, oiled metal. Brass wyrmlings probably learn to talk more quickly than the young of any other sentient species. As it matures, a brass dragon adds a love of fire to its love of speech. Though they have an extremely deadly breath weapon, they are more fragile than other dragons. As a result, they make alliances with small groups of intelligent creatures, such as tribes of nomadic Dragonborn. 

The brass dragon prefers to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also prefer to have their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun will warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon&#x27;s lair is well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders along with bolt holes. The centerpiece of any brass dragon&#x27;s lair is the Grand Conversation Hall, where it spends the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors.

The brass dragon was an example of content misrepresented by the game&#x27;s detractors, by whom it was described erroneously as the worst of dragons.

=== Bronze dragon ===
Duty-bound and honorable to a fault, bronze dragons commit themselves to order and are among the greatest and most devout champions of that ideal. As order&#x27;s sworn servants, bronze dragons can seem arrogant and haughty, with an inflated sense of self, a tendency that can put them at odds with those they meet. Bronze dragons claim coastlines, inlets, and islands as their own, constructing lairs in coastal caves that have access to the sea. All bronze dragons share a deep and abiding hatred for blue dragons, and they are vigilant in protecting their homes from these interlopers.

Physically, the bronze dragon is quite fierce in appearance, despite its good nature. While most of its body is a reflective copper color, the wings are often tipped with green. The eyes of a bronze dragon begin with a green iris and as they age the eye slowly becomes a solid green with no distinct iris. The dragon has three main large horns protruding from each cheek, pointing back towards the tail. It also has a couple of smaller horns. The tips of these points are black and very sharp, and are often used for grooming. The tongue is purple-gray, long and pointed, and not forked. A large frill runs down the upper part of its neck.

Bronze dragons mate for life and they lay their eggs in a dry cave. Upon hatching, the wyrmlings are raised, taught, and protected by their parents. A newly hatched bronze wyrmling appears yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales will gradually shift to bronze as it matures. Bronze wyrmlings hold a strong sense of responsibility from the moment it leaves the egg. Given its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon&#x27;s lair is quite naturally underwater, and often disguised with seaweed and coral. The bulk of the lair is above water level, however, consisting of multiple tunnels and large chambers, some as much as a thousand feet above sea level.

While bronze dragons are often fascinated with battles, especially fighting to defeat evil, they have strong moral compunctions against killing living beings unless absolutely necessary. They will often join good-aligned armies to fight the forces of evil, either in human form or their own.

=== Copper Dragon ===

Copper dragons are the second weakest of the metallic dragons. They are born tricksters and jokesters.

Physically, the copper dragon is very striking, with scales of a warm copper color tinged with blue. Like the brass dragon, the copper dragon&#x27;s wings connect to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. However, its wings have a pronounced bend to them, giving them the appearance of a &quot;V&quot; from below, rather than the brass dragon&#x27;s triangular appearance. Copper dragons are powerful jumpers and climbers, with massive thigh and shoulder muscles. Their two horns are broad and flat, pointing backwards towards the tail from the top of their heads. They also have a distinctive frill protruding from either jaw. When the mouth is closed, the teeth are completely hidden.

When newly hatched, the scales of a copper wyrmling are a muddy brown in color, which gradually shifts to a glowing copper as it matures. Adult copper dragons are quite social, mainly due to the desire to play tricks upon each other. A typical copper dragon&#x27;s lair is a cave, whose entrance is concealed by rocks and boulders. Upon entering, visitors find themselves in a huge labyrinth of tunnels. Copper dragons compete amongst themselves to see who can design the most confusing layout.

When it comes to combat, copper dragons prefer to avoid it. Rather than fighting openly, they prefer to taunt, humiliate, and tease their opponents until they simply give up and run away. Their ability to dramatically slow opponents often gives them ample time to run away. When forced, however, a copper dragon will fight to the very end, and is an incredibly devious antagonist.

=== Gold dragon ===
Gold dragons are based on creatures from Chinese mythology. In the game, they are the most powerful of the metallic dragons (in some versions they are the strongest of all dragons), and the most dedicated to defeating evil. They spend the bulk of their lives in human form, seeking out evil and punishing wrongdoers to the best of their considerable abilities. Gold dragons are also voracious learners who freely share their knowledge and experience.

Gold dragons have several large horns tipped with umber shoot sideways from their cheeks, and two very prominent horns point backwards along their heads. The most obvious feature is probably the tentacle whiskers that sprout from the top and bottom of the gold dragon&#x27;s jaw, giving the appearance of a beard of sorts. Their wings, like those of brass and copper dragons, connect to the body all the way to the tip of the tail. From below, the overall shape resembles that of a brass dragon, but the different coloring and dramatic difference in size enables easy differentiation. When in flight, the gold dragon&#x27;s wings ripple, giving the appearance of swimming rather than flying. A newly hatched gold wyrmling appears similar to an adult, except that it lacks horns or tentacle whiskers.

Gold dragons devote immense time and energy to the construction of their lairs. The layout of their lairs often resemble those of elegant human mansions, albeit buried underground. Unlike many species of dragons, gold dragons have a very firm and hierarchical social structure, encompassing all members of the species. 

Gold dragons prefer to talk rather than to fight. While powerful opponents, they avoid unnecessary combat since they dislike killing.

=== Silver Dragon ===
Silver dragons are the second most powerful of the metallic dragons, and are true friends to all. The silver dragon enjoys the company of humans and elves so much that it will often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life.

At first glance, the silver dragon appears very similar to the white dragon. The wings are more curved than a white&#x27;s though, and the silver has two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also has a beautiful frill that begins at the top of its head and flows all the way down its neck and body to the tip of the tail. The frill is silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They have two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also have a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which has the rough appearance of a goatee. Silver dragons are extremely rare and elusive, preferring to take the guise of kind and elderly humanoids or very young humanoids. 

Most silvers group together in &quot;clans&quot;, a loose organization of dragons who choose to live together as a family. Clans take communal responsibility for protecting and raising their wyrmlings which are intelligent, kind, extremely curious, and adorable. A senior member of the clan may act as a leader, but no true leader actually exists. However, many silver dragons leave their clans for long periods of time to live among non-dragons. Unlike the gold or bronze dragon, the silver dragon does not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. They are more interested in protecting the humanoids they have come to care for than in looking for evil. 

Like most metallic dragons, silvers do not enjoy combat, and are averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they are as deadly as any other dragon. Silver dragons&#x27; favored enemy are red dragons because these chromatic dragons are almost always evil and have a talent for destruction. Additionally, silvers and reds favor the same sort of mountainous terrain for lairs, which leads to territorial disputes on top of having attitudes and philosophies at odds with the others&#x27;. A silver dragon&#x27;s lair is typically found within an icy mountain, with the main entrance only accessible by air.

=== Rare types ===
== Gem dragons ==
Gem dragons are a classification of dragon based on &quot;gem type rather than color or metal&quot;. They are typically of neutral alignment with respect to good and evil, but some kinds are quite egoistic and awful company nevertheless. The Gem dragon family comprise Amethyst Dragons, Crystal Dragons, Emerald Dragons, Sapphire Dragons, and Topaz Dragons. Sardior is the deity of gem dragons. Although Obsidian Dragons are also technically gem dragons, they are opposed to Sardior and most other gem dragons.

=== Publication history ===
The gem dragons (the amethyst dragon, the crystal dragon, the emerald dragon, the sapphire dragon and the topaz dragon) and Sardior the Ruby Dragon first appeared in the first edition in &quot;Dragon&quot; #37 (May 1980).

The gem dragons appeared in the second edition in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix&quot; (1992), and the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993). They appeared as player character races in the &quot;Council of Wyrms&quot; set (1994) and the &quot;Campaign Option: Council of Wyrms&quot; book (1999).

The gem dragons appeared in the third edition in &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; (2002).

The sapphire dragon was introduced in the fifth edition as a stat block, along with some history on gem dragons, in a charity supplement to raise money for Extra Life. Gem dragons (amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, and topaz) in full detail then appeared in the supplement &quot;Fizban&#x27;s Treasury of Dragons&quot; (2021). &quot;SyFy Wire&quot; highlighted that &quot;they have new abilities and breath weapons that use the less-common damage types of radiant, necrotic, thunder, psychic, and force. &quot;Fizban&quot;&quot;&#x27;s&quot; contains stat blocks for gem dragons at different ages and challenge ratings, same as the dragons in the basic &quot;Monster Manual&quot;&quot;.

=== Amethyst dragon ===
The most powerful of the neutral gem dragons, amethyst dragons are honorable, regal creatures. At birth, these dragons have lavender skin with fine, translucent-purple scales. These scales darken as the creature grows older, eventually reaching a sparkling lavender color. These creatures approach life with a detached air, ignoring the conflicts of good and evil, law and chaos. At best, they see these conflicts as petty squabbles over inconsequential points of view, and not worthy of their time or consideration. These majestic dragons consider themselves to be the leaders of the gem dragons, and most of the lesser gem dragons acquiesce to this leadership – in everyday life and in the Council Aerie.

Amethyst dragons eat large quantities of fish and gems. They keep vassals to attend to their needs, though they do not place as many restrictions or requirements on them as other dragon lords do. Most keep at least one hidden, underwater cave for seclusion and secrecy. While amethyst dragons consider their silver and copper cousins to be foolish and have an active dislike of red and white dragons, they do not consider any life form to be their inherent enemies. They prefer to reason out a settlement through discussion and negotiation rather than through combat, but they can and will fight if they must.

=== Crystal dragon ===
Crystal dragons spend much time trying to learn about world around them. They value friendship over all else and the treasures tend to be sentimental rather than valuable, they welcome visitors who come to them with good intentions. Like other benevolent dragons, the crystal dragons prefer to talk rather than fight. Hatchlings have glossy white scales that become more and more translucent with age. By the time they reach adulthood, these scales become luminescent in moonlight. In the full light of the day they glow with a dazzling, almost unbearable brilliance.

Fun-loving and mischievous, crystal dragons tend to be irresponsible rulers. They establish domains in the cold, open northern reaches, building castles out of snow and ice. They leave these castles open to the sky, for they love to watch the stars on clear, cold nights. The white dragon clans consider crystal dragons to be nothing more than prey, so the two types are almost always in conflict. However, it has also been known for crystal dragons to adopt white dragon hatchlings.

=== Emerald dragon ===
Emerald dragons live among the tropical islands. They are a curious species, taken to keeping track of history, lore and customs. They tend to be very reclusive, suspicious that others covet their treasure hoards and territory. Hatchlings have translucent green scales, which harden and take on many shades of green as they age. These scales are scintillating in the light, giving an emerald dragon&#x27;s hide the appearance of being in constant motion.

A desire for privacy runs through the emerald clans, going so far as to determine where the dragon lords and their spawn establish lairs. The primary lairs consist of traps and alarms designed to warn the dragon of visitor and other threats. Emerald dragons prefer to quietly observe intruders and rarely emerge from hiding. When forced into combat, emerald dragons prefer to attack by ambush, using stealth and surprise attacks to quickly disable their enemies. If the threat prove to be too great to handle, an emerald dragon will not hesitate to retreat. However, it will plan revenge, and its patience can last for centuries if need be.

Emerald dragons have no compunctions about what they eat. They prefer lizards and giants, but they will eat anything in a pinch. Of all the other type of dragonkind, emerald dragons get along best with the sapphire dragons, often controlling parallel domains (emerald dragons taking the surface, sapphire dragon the subterranean areas below). They fear the red dragons because of their well-known greed. Emeralds like the security and protection offered by a trusted partner and will take a single mate for a long time.

=== Sapphire dragon ===
The sapphire dragons prefer subterranean domains. While most of the territory above their realms belong to the emerald dragons, they keep a small portion of the surface area as their own as well as the extensive caverns beneath the tropical jungles. Of all dragonkind, perhaps the sapphire dragon clans are the most militaristic. They fervently protect their territory from outsiders, going so far as to distrust anyone who even gets close to their borders. As most of the territory that interests the sapphire clans is below the ground, they rarely come into conflict with other dragon clans unless they attempt to take caverns currently in use. Only the black dragons compete with them for the tropical underground, and even they are wary of going into direct conflict with the armies of the sapphire clans.

From birth, sapphire dragons are beautiful, with scale ranging from light to dark blue in color, which sparkle in the light. Because of their coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for blue dragons. Giant spiders make up most of a sapphire dragon&#x27;s diet, and great hunts are conducted in the tunnels to find these delicacies. While militaristic and warlike, the sapphire dragons are not quick to attack. They prefer to observe intruders (all visitors are intruders) so that they can plan how to deal with them. If a sapphire dragon or its treasure is ever threatened, it attacks immediately with its breath weapon, spells, and physical attacks. It uses psionics and special abilities to escape if faced with a more powerful foe. Sapphire dragons take a single mate for long periods of time, however sapphires seek to possess a mate to enhance their prestige and status more than other reasons

=== Topaz dragon ===
Topaz dragons inhabit the coastal regions of temperate islands, building lairs below the waterline, though constructing them so they remain dry. Clannish and self-seeking, these gem dragons usually want little to do with the other inhabitants of the isles. For the most part these dragons neither seek company nor welcome it.

Out of the egg, a topaz dragon is a dull yellow-orange in color. With the age, its scales harden and become translucent and faceted. When it reaches adulthood, a topaz dragon sparkles in the light of the sun. While topaz dragons enjoy the feel of sea wind and spray on their faceted-scale hides, they do not particularly like the water. They swim to hunt, attack, or reach their lairs, but not for enjoyment. They do love to eat fish and other sea creatures, especially the tasty giant squids that live in the Coral Sea.

Unless it specifically interests or affect them, topaz dragons tend to be indifferent to the causes and concerns that occupy the rest of dragonkind. While not malicious, topaz dragons are not the best of company or particularly pleasant to deal with. Besides caring little for social graces, they display erratic behavior that is unsettling and very confusing. They dislike visitors, but tend to avoid combat if they can help it. If combat is unavoidable, they use tricks and promises to distract their foes before striking with teeth and claws. They dislike bronze dragons. It takes time for a topaz dragon to accept another dragon&#x27;s friendship, but once it does it remains a friend for life. Once another dragon gets past its outer defenses and gruff exterior, it finds a loyal companion and ready protector in the topaz dragon.

=== Obsidian dragon ===
Obsidian dragons, while the most intelligent of the gem dragons, are also the most vicious. They are extremely haughty, anger easily, and like to toy with prey before finishing it off. An obsidian dragon has smooth black skin with razor edges where joints come together. When first hatched, their scales are gray, rough to touch, and well defined. As they get older, the scales darken, become smoother, and begin to blend together.

Most obsidian dragons prefer to make their lairs around volcanoes or in one of the mountains of coal found on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Most great wyrms, though, make use of the genesis power to create their own demiplane.

===Reception===
Mark Theurer, in a 2002 review for &quot;Fictional Reality&quot;, remarked that gem dragons &quot;have some interesting breath weapons&quot;.

Jennifer Melzer, for &quot;CBR&quot; in 2021 prior to the publication of &quot;Fizban&#x27;s Treasury of Dragons&quot;, commented that &quot;one of the most unique characteristics of the Gem dragons are their scales, which have the crystalline appearance of gemstones. They also tend to be psionic, meaning they are great masters of magical abilities of a psychic nature such as telepathy, psychokinesis and clairsentience&quot;. She stated that these dragons range in temperament and &quot;while some of them enjoy (and even long for) conversation with intelligent creatures, they tend to be solitary, preferring to maintain their distance from the world and its problems in hopes that the world keeps its distance from them&quot;. Melzer also highlighted that back in third edition &quot;obsidian dragons were the most intelligent and dangerous of the Gem dragons&quot;.

In ranking the dragons included in &quot;Fizban&#x27;s Treasury of Dragons&quot;, Brooke Thomas of &quot;CBR&quot; listed gem dragons as #2. Thomas stated that these dragons were &quot;likely opponents for the average campaign&quot; unlike dragons towards the higher end of the challenge-rating range. Thomas considered gem dragons &quot;exciting&quot; due to &quot;their versatility, utility, and contribution to world-building efforts&quot;.
==Other types of dragons==
In most descriptions, true dragons only comprise the two families of chromatic dragons and metallic dragons. There are, however, many more families among the true dragons, and some kinds exists outside any specific category.

=== Lesser dragons ===
Lesser Dragons comprise all dragonkind that are not true dragons, and includes a broad range of creatures.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons for Dummies&quot; assigned the dragon a central role, stating that for many characters &quot;the opportunity to fight a dragon (and pillage its hoard) is the reason you play the game&quot;. The authors also chose a specific dragon each among the ten best monsters for low- and mid-level characters. Michael Witwer &quot;et al.&quot; observed that few dragons appeared in adventures published early in the game&#x27;s history, however, due to their extreme danger to characters: &quot;Dragons were great for book and box covers; in games they were impractical. There simply wasn&#x27;t a playable D&amp;D framework for including dragons as a regular feature.&quot; The &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting was developed as one means to remedy this discrepancy.

Jon Peterson described dragons in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; as greedy for treasure. He found it ironic, that they became &quot;the&quot; iconic creature in the game to conquer for the characters, as accumulation of treasures was one major goal of the game - exactly what the folkloric and fantasy images of hoarding dragons preceding &quot;D&amp;D&quot; warned against.

Similarly, Philip J. Clements wrote about &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;: &quot;Even the name suggests&quot; that &quot;both dungeons and dragons exist to be overcome and exploited by the power and cunning of the characters&quot;.

GameSpy author Allan Rausch commented on the improvements in the depiction of dragons in 3rd edition artwork: &quot;Dragons were redesigned with an eye toward giving them distinctive characteristics that would work in their preferred environments -- making them distinctively D&amp;D dragons.&quot;

The ancient blue dragon was ranked third among the ten best high-level 4th Edition monsters by the authors of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies&quot;. The authors described the ancient dragons as &quot;the most powerful versions of these majestic and deadly creatures, and the ancient blue dragon approaches the pinnacle of all dragon-kin&quot;, surpassed only by the red dragon. The authors concluded that &quot;Few single challengers can stand long against the fury of this terrible dragon as it unleashes lightning and thunder.&quot;

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; compiled a list of the game&#x27;s &quot;10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked&quot; in 2018, calling the prismatic dragon one of the strongest, saying &quot;It represents the ultimate challenge for any party of adventurers, though it would easily dispose of all but the most insanely overleveled groups. Defeating a prismatic dragon would also represent the ultimate challenge for the actual players, as they would likely expire from old age before rolling all of the dice necessary to finish an encounter with the creature.&quot;

==Other publishers==
A dragon was the main antagonist in the early handheld electronic games licensed to Mattel, the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Computer Labyrinth Game&quot; (1980) and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Computer Fantasy Game&quot; (1981) and appeared in the Intellivision games &quot;Cloudy Mountain&quot; (1982) and &quot;Treasure of Tarmin&quot; (1983).

In 1981 Varanae published a supplement named &quot;Dragons&quot; detailing 50 new dragon types in the format of a &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. In 1986 a scenario also titled &quot;Dragons&quot; was published by Mayfair Games, with a war between good and evil dragons as backdrop, and including more background material about dragons.

The black dragon, blue dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, green dragon, red dragon, silver dragon, and white dragon are fully detailed in Paizo Publishing&#x27;s book &quot;Dragons Revisited&quot; (2009).

<doc id="439458" wikidata="Q217068" url="?curid=439458" title="Charles-Valentin Alkan">
<text>Charles-Valentin Alkan (; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life.

Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians.

Alkan&#x27;s attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer&#x27;s works.

Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase), Alkan&#x27;s music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought it back into the repertoire.

==Life==

===Family===
Alkan was born Charles-Valentin Morhange on 30 November 1813 at 1 Rue de Braque in Paris to Alkan Morhange (1780–1855) and Julie Morhange, née Abraham. Alkan Morhange was descended from a long-established Jewish Ashkenazic community in the region of Metz; the village of Morhange is located about from the city of Metz. Charles-Valentin was the second of six children – one elder sister and four younger brothers; his birth certificate indicates that he was named after a neighbour who witnessed the birth.

Alkan Morhange supported the family as a musician and later as the proprietor of a private music school in le Marais, in the Jewish quarter of Paris. At an early age, Charles-Valentin and his siblings adopted their father&#x27;s first name as their last (and were known by this during their studies at the Conservatoire de Paris and subsequent careers). His brother Napoléon (1826–1906) became professor of solfège at the Conservatoire, his brother Maxim (1818–1897) had a career writing light music for Parisian theatres, and his sister, Céleste (1812–1897), was a singer. His brother Ernest (1816–1876) was a professional flautist, while the youngest brother Gustave (1827–1882) was to publish various dances for the piano.

===Prodigy (1819–1831)===


Alkan was a child prodigy. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at an unusually early age, and studied both piano and organ. The records of his auditions survive in the Archives Nationales in Paris. At his solfège audition on 3 July 1819, when he was just over 5 years 7 months, the examiners noted Alkan (who is referred to even at this early date as &quot;Alkan (Valentin)&quot;, and whose age is given incorrectly as six-and-a-half) as &quot;having a pretty little voice&quot;. The profession of Alkan Morhange is given as &quot;music-paper ruler&quot;. At Charles-Valentin&#x27;s piano audition on 6 October 1820, when he was nearly seven (and where he is named as &quot;Alkan (Morhange) Valentin&quot;), the examiners comment &quot;This child has amazing abilities.&quot;

Alkan became a favourite of his teacher at the Conservatoire, Joseph Zimmerman, who also taught Georges Bizet, César Franck, Charles Gounod, and Ambroise Thomas. At the age of seven, Alkan won a first prize for solfège and in later years prizes in piano (1824), harmony (1827, as student of Victor Dourlen), and organ (1834). At the age of seven-and-a-half he gave his first public performance, appearing as a violinist and playing an air and variations by Pierre Rode. Alkan&#x27;s Opus 1, a set of variations for piano based on a theme by Daniel Steibelt, dates from 1828, when he was 14 years old. At about this time he also undertook teaching duties at his father&#x27;s school. Antoine Marmontel, one of Charles-Valentin&#x27;s pupils there, who was later to become his &quot;&quot;, wrote of the school:

Young children, mostly Jewish, were given elementary musical instruction and also learnt the first rudiments of French grammar ... [There] I received a few lessons from the young Alkan, four years my senior ... I see once more ... that really parochial environment where the talent of Valentin Alkan was formed and where his hard-working youth blossomed ... It was like a preparatory school, a juvenile annexe of the Conservatoire.

From about 1826 Alkan began to appear as a piano soloist in leading Parisian &quot;salons&quot;, including those of the Princesse de la Moskova (widow of Marshal Ney), and the Duchesse de Montebello. He was probably introduced to these venues by his teacher Zimmerman. At the same time, Alkan Morhange arranged concerts featuring Charles-Valentin at public venues in Paris, in association with leading musicians including the sopranos Giuditta Pasta and Henriette Sontag, the cellist Auguste Franchomme and the violinist Lambert Massart, with whom Alkan gave concerts in a rare visit out of France to Brussels in 1827. In 1829, at the age of 15, Alkan was appointed joint professor of solfège – among his pupils in this class a few years later was his brother Napoléon. In this manner Alkan&#x27;s musical career was launched well before the July Revolution of 1830, which initiated a period in which &quot;keyboard virtuosity ... completely dominated professional music making&quot; in the capital, attracting from all over Europe pianists who, as Heinrich Heine wrote, invaded &quot;like a plague of locusts swarming to pick Paris clean&quot;. Alkan nonetheless continued his studies and in 1831 enrolled in the organ classes of François Benoist, from whom he may have learnt to appreciate the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, of whom Benoist was then one of the few French advocates.

===Early fame (1831–1837)===

Throughout the early years of the July Monarchy, Alkan continued to teach and play at public concerts and in eminent social circles. He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first &quot;Concerto da camera&quot; for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential &quot;Société Académique des Enfants d&#x27;Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo)&quot;, whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society&#x27;s concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, &quot;Hermann et Ketty&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Entrée en loge&quot;, have remained unpublished and unperformed.
In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence. Like virtually all of Alkan&#x27;s correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second &quot;Concerto da camera&quot; was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo piano, the &quot;Twelve Caprices&quot;, published in 1837 as Opp. 12, 13, 15 and 16. Op. 16, the &quot;Trois scherzi de bravoure&quot;, is dedicated to Masarnau. In January 1836, Liszt recommended Alkan for the post of Professor at the Geneva Conservatoire, which Alkan declined, and in 1837 he wrote an enthusiastic review of Alkan&#x27;s Op. 15 Caprices in the &quot;Revue et gazette musicale&quot;.

===At the Square d&#x27;Orléans (1837–1848)===

From 1837, Alkan lived in the Square d&#x27;Orléans in Paris, which was inhabited by numerous celebrities of the time including Marie Taglioni, Alexandre Dumas, George Sand, and Chopin. Chopin and Alkan were personal friends and often discussed musical topics, including a work on musical theory that Chopin proposed to write. By 1838, at 25 years old, Alkan had reached a peak of his career. He frequently gave recitals, his more mature works had begun to be published, and he often appeared in concerts with Liszt and Chopin. On 23 April 1837 Alkan took part in Liszt&#x27;s farewell concert in Paris, together with the 14-year-old César Franck and the virtuoso Johann Peter Pixis. On 3 March 1838, at a concert at the piano-maker Pape, Alkan played with Chopin, Zimmerman, and Chopin&#x27;s pupil Adolphe Gutmann in a performance of Alkan&#x27;s transcription, now lost, of two movements of Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony for two pianos, eight hands.

At this point, for a period which coincided with the birth and childhood of his , Élie-Miriam Delaborde (1839–1913), Alkan withdrew into private study and composition for six years, returning to the concert platform only in 1844. Alkan neither asserted nor denied his paternity of Delaborde, which, however, his contemporaries seemed to assume. Marmontel wrote cryptically in a biography of Delaborde that &quot;[his] birth is a page from a novel in the life of a great artist&quot;. Alkan gave early piano lessons to Delaborde, who was to follow his natural father as a keyboard virtuoso.

Alkan&#x27;s return to the concert platform in 1844 was greeted with enthusiasm by critics, who noted the &quot;admirable perfection&quot; of his technique, and lauded him as &quot;a model of science and inspiration&quot;, a &quot;sensation&quot; and an &quot;explosion&quot;. They also commented on the attending celebrities including Liszt, Chopin, Sand and Dumas. In the same year he published his piano étude &quot;Le chemin de fer&quot;, which critics, following Ronald Smith, believe to be the first representation in music of a steam engine. Between 1844 and 1848 Alkan produced a series of virtuoso pieces, the 25 &quot;Préludes&quot; Op. 31 for piano or organ, and the sonata Op. 33 &quot;Les quatre âges&quot;. Following an Alkan recital in 1848, the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer was so impressed that he invited the pianist, whom he considered &quot;a most remarkable artist&quot;, to prepare the piano arrangement of the overture to his forthcoming opera, &quot;Le prophète&quot;. Meyerbeer heard and approved Alkan&#x27;s arrangement of the overture for four hands (which Alkan played with his brother Napoléon) in 1849; published in 1850, it is the only record of the overture, which was scrapped during rehearsals at the Opéra.

===Retreat (1848–1872)===

In 1848 Alkan was bitterly disappointed when the head of the Conservatoire, Daniel Auber, replaced the retiring Zimmerman with the mediocre Antoine Marmontel as head of the Conservatoire piano department, a position which Alkan had eagerly anticipated, and for which he had strongly lobbied with the support of Sand, Dumas, and many other leading figures. A disgusted Alkan described the appointment in a letter to Sand as &quot;the most incredible, the most shameful nomination&quot;; and Delacroix noted in his journal: &quot;By his confrontation with Auber, [Alkan] has been very put out and will doubtless continue to be so.&quot; The upset arising from this incident may account for Alkan&#x27;s reluctance to perform in public in the ensuing period. His withdrawal was also influenced by the death of Chopin; in 1850 he wrote to Masarnau &quot;I have lost the strength to be of any economic or political use&quot;, and lamented &quot;the death of poor Chopin, another blow which I felt deeply.&quot; Chopin, on his deathbed in 1849, had indicated his respect for Alkan by bequeathing him his unfinished work on a piano method, intending him to complete it, and after Chopin&#x27;s death a number of his students transferred to Alkan. After giving two concerts in 1853, Alkan withdrew, in spite of his fame and technical accomplishment, into virtual seclusion for some twenty years.

Little is known of this period of Alkan&#x27;s life, other than that apart from composing he was immersed in the study of the Bible and the Talmud. Throughout this period Alkan continued his correspondence with Ferdinand Hiller, whom he had probably met in Paris in the 1830s, and with Masarnau, from which some insights can be gained. It appears that Alkan completed a full translation into French, now lost, of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from their original languages. In 1865, he wrote to Hiller: &quot;Having translated a good deal of the Apocrypha, I&#x27;m now onto the second Gospel which I am translating from the Syriac ... In starting to translate the New Testament, I was suddenly struck by a singular idea – that you have to be Jewish to be able to do it.&quot;

Despite his seclusion from society, this period saw the composition and publication of many of Alkan&#x27;s major piano works, including the &quot;Douze études dans tous les tons mineurs&quot;, Op. 39 (1857), the &quot;Sonatine&quot;, Op. 61 (1861), the 49 &quot;Esquisses&quot;, Op. 63 (1861), and the five collections of &quot;Chants&quot; (1857–1872), as well as the &quot;Sonate de concert&quot; for cello and piano, Op. 47 (1856). These did not pass unremarked; Hans von Bülow, for example, gave a laudatory review of the Op. 35 &quot;Études&quot; in the &quot;Neue Berliner Musikzeitung&quot; in 1857, the year in which they were published in Berlin, commenting that &quot;Alkan is unquestionably the most eminent representative of the modern piano school at Paris. The virtuoso&#x27;s disinclination to travel, and his firm reputation as a teacher, explain why, at present, so little attention has been given to his work in Germany.&quot;

From the early 1850s Alkan began to turn his attention seriously to the pedal piano (pédalier). Alkan gave his first public performances on the pédalier to great critical acclaim in 1852. From 1859 onwards he began to publish pieces designated as &quot;for organ or piano à pédalier&quot;.

===Reappearance (1873–1888)===
It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six &quot;Petits Concerts&quot; at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the &quot;Petits Concerts&quot; led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan&#x27;s health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The &quot;Petits Concerts&quot; featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.

Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d&#x27;Indy, who recalled Alkan&#x27;s &quot;skinny, hooked fingers&quot; playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: &quot;I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.&quot; Alkan later played Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 110 sonata, of which d&#x27;Indy said: &quot;What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ... I couldn&#x27;t begin to describe – above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt—perhaps less perfect, technically—but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving...&quot;

The biographer of Chopin, Frederick Niecks, sought Alkan for his recollections in 1880 but was sternly denied access by Alkan&#x27;s concierge – &quot;To my ... enquiry when he could be found at home, the reply was a ... decisive &#x27;Never&#x27;.&quot; However, a few days later he found Alkan at Érard&#x27;s, and Niecks writes of their meeting that &quot;his reception of me was not merely polite but most friendly.&quot;
===Death===

According to his death certificate, Alkan died in Paris on 29 March 1888 at the age of 74. Alkan was buried on 1 April (Easter Sunday) in the Jewish section of Montmartre Cemetery, Paris, not far from the tomb of his contemporary Fromental Halévy; his sister Céleste was later buried in the same tomb.

For many years it was believed that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a &quot;porte-parapluie&quot; (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan&#x27;s family originated.

==Personality==

Alkan was described by Marmontel (who refers to &quot;a regrettable misunderstanding at a moment of our careers in 1848&quot;), as follows:

We will not give the portrait of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some photographs we have seen. His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities.

Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to a friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: &quot;[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn&#x27;t get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn&#x27;t a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.&quot; Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan &quot;particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, &#x27;des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]&#x27;, as Isidore Philipp described them.&quot;

Alkan&#x27;s aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that &quot;Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.&quot;

Alkan&#x27;s later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller:

I&#x27;m becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can&#x27;t see the point or goal.&quot;

This spirit of anomie may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public, or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions. However, it should not be ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self-analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau.

Hugh MacDonald writes that &quot;Alkan&#x27;s enigmatic character is reflected in his music – he dressed in a severe, old-fashioned, somewhat clerical manner – only in black – discouraged visitors and went out rarely – he had few friends – was nervous in public and was pathologically worried about his health, even though it was good&quot;. Ronald Smith writes that &quot;Alkan&#x27;s characteristics, exacerbated no doubt by his isolation, are carried to the edge of fanaticism, and at the heart of Alkan&#x27;s creativity there is also fierce obsessional control; his obsession with a specific idea can border on the pathological.&quot;

Jack Gibbons writes of Alkan&#x27;s personality: &quot;Alkan was an intelligent, lively, humorous and warm person (all characteristics which feature strongly in his music) whose only crime seems to have been having a vivid imagination, and whose occasional eccentricities (mild when compared with the behaviour of other &#x27;highly-strung&#x27; artistes!) stemmed mainly from his hypersensitive nature.&quot; Macdonald, however, suggests that &quot;Alkan was a man of profoundly conservative ideas, whose lifestyle, manner of dress, and belief in the traditions of historic music, set him apart from other musicians and the world at large.&quot;
==Judaism==
Alkan grew up in a religiously observant Jewish household. His grandfather Marix Morhange had been a printer of the Talmud in Metz, and was probably a &quot;melamed&quot; (Hebrew teacher) in the Jewish congregation at Paris. Alkan&#x27;s widespread reputation as a student of the Old Testament and religion, and the high quality of his Hebrew handwriting testify to his knowledge of the religion, and some of his habits indicate that he practised at least some of its obligations, such as maintaining the laws of kashrut. Alkan was regarded by the Paris Consistory, the central Jewish organisation of the city, as an authority on Jewish music. In 1845 he assisted the Consistory in evaluating the musical ability of Samuel Naumbourg, who was subsequently appointed as &quot;hazzan&quot; (cantor) of the main Paris synagogue; and he later contributed choral pieces in each of Naumbourg&#x27;s collections of synagogue music (1847 and 1856). Alkan was appointed organist at the Synagogue de Nazareth in 1851, although he resigned the post almost immediately for &quot;artistic reasons&quot;.

Alkan&#x27;s Op. 31 set of &quot;Préludes&quot; includes a number of pieces based on Jewish subjects, including some titled &quot;Prière (Prayer)&quot;, one preceded by a quote from the &quot;Song of Songs&quot;, and another titled &quot;Ancienne mélodie de la synagogue (Old synagogue melody).&quot; The collection is believed to be &quot;the first publication of art music specifically to deploy Jewish themes and ideas.&quot; Alkan&#x27;s three settings of synagogue melodies, prepared for his former pupil Zina de Mansouroff, are further examples of his interest in Jewish music; Kessous Dreyfuss provides a detailed analysis of these works and their origins. Other works evidencing this interest include no. 7 of his Op. 66. &quot;11 Grands préludes et 1 Transcription&quot; (1866), entitled &quot;Alla giudesca&quot; and marked &quot;con divozione&quot;, a parody of excessive &quot;hazzanic&quot; practice; and the slow movement of the cello sonata Op. 47 (1857), which is prefaced by a quotation from the Old Testament prophet Micah and uses melodic tropes derived from the cantillation of the &quot;haftarah&quot; in the synagogue.

The inventory of Alkan&#x27;s apartment made after his death indicates over 75 volumes in Hebrew or related to Judaism, left to his brother Napoléon (as well as 36 volumes of music manuscript). These are all lost. Bequests in his will to the Conservatoire to found prizes for composition of cantatas on Old Testament themes and for performance on the pedal-piano, and to a Jewish charity for the training of apprentices, were refused by the beneficiaries.

==Music==
===Influences===

Brigitte François-Sappey points out the frequency with which Alkan has been compared to Berlioz, both by his contemporaries and later. She mentions that Hans von Bülow called him &quot;the Berlioz of the piano&quot;, while Schumann, in criticising the Op. 15 &quot;Romances&quot;, claimed that Alkan merely &quot;imitated Berlioz on the piano.&quot; She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni repeated the comparison with Berlioz in a draft (but unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji commented that Alkan&#x27;s Op. 61 &quot;Sonatine&quot; was like &quot;a Beethoven sonata written by Berlioz&quot;. Berlioz was ten years older than Alkan, but did not attend the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were acquainted, and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of Anton Reicha who taught at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the French Revolution. They both created individual, indeed, idiosyncratic sound-worlds in their music; there are, however, major differences between them. Alkan, unlike Berlioz, remained closely dedicated to the German musical tradition; his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism, whereas Berlioz could hardly play at the keyboard and wrote almost nothing for piano solo. Alkan&#x27;s works therefore also include miniatures and (among his early works) &quot;salon&quot; music, genres which Berlioz avoided.

Alkan&#x27;s attachment to the music of his predecessors is demonstrated throughout his career, from his arrangements for keyboard of Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony (1838), and of the minuet of Mozart&#x27;s 40th Symphony (1844), through the sets &quot;Souvenirs des concerts du Conservatoire&quot; (1847 and 1861) and the set &quot;Souvenirs de musique de chambre&quot; (1862), which include transcriptions of music by Mozart, Beethoven, J. S. Bach, Haydn, Gluck, and others. In this context should be mentioned Alkan&#x27;s extensive cadenza for Beethoven&#x27;s 3rd Piano Concerto (1860), which includes quotes from the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony. Alkan&#x27;s transcriptions, together with original music of Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Couperin and Rameau, were frequently played during the series of &quot;Petits Concerts&quot; given by Alkan at Erard.

As regards the music of his own time, Alkan was unenthusiastic, or at any rate detached. He commented to Hiller that &quot;Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease.&quot; While he admired Berlioz&#x27;s talent, he did not enjoy his music. At the &quot;Petits Concerts&quot;, little more recent than Mendelssohn and Chopin (both of whom had died around 25 years before the series of concerts was initiated) was played, except for Alkan&#x27;s own works and occasionally some by his favourites such as Saint-Saëns.

===Style===
 &quot;Like ... Chopin&quot;, writes pianist and academic Kenneth Hamilton, &quot;Alkan&#x27;s musical output was centred almost exclusively on the piano&quot;. Some of his music requires extreme technical virtuosity, clearly reflecting his own abilities, often calling for great velocity, enormous leaps at speed, long stretches of fast repeated notes, and the maintenance of widely spaced contrapuntal lines. The illustration (right) from the &quot;Grande sonate&quot; is analysed by Smith as &quot;six parts in invertible counterpoint, plus two extra voices and three doublings – eleven parts in all.&quot; Some typical musical devices, such as a sudden explosive final chord following a quiet passage, were established at an early stage in Alkan&#x27;s compositions.

Macdonald suggests that

unlike Wagner, Alkan did not seek to refashion the world through opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music at the service of literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.

However, not all of Alkan&#x27;s music is either lengthy or technically difficult; for example, many of the Op. 31 &quot;Préludes&quot; and of the set of &quot;Esquisses&quot;, Op. 63.

Moreover, in terms of structure, Alkan in his compositions sticks to traditional musical forms, although he often took them to extremes, as he did with piano technique. The study Op. 39, no. 8 (the first movement of the &quot;Concerto for solo piano&quot;) takes almost half an hour in performance. Describing this &quot;gigantic&quot; piece, Ronald Smith comments that it convinces for the same reasons as does the music of the classical masters; &quot;the underlying unity of its principal themes, and a key structure that is basically simple and sound.&quot;

The &quot;Chant&quot; Op. 38, no. 2, entitled &quot;Fa&quot;, repeats the note of its title incessantly (in total 414 times) against shifting harmonies which make it &quot;cut ... into the texture with the ruthless precision of a laser beam.&quot; In modelling his five sets of &quot;Chants&quot; on the first book of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Songs Without Words&quot;, Alkan ensured that the pieces in each of his sets followed precisely the same key signatures, and even the moods, of the original. Alkan was rigorous in his enharmonic spelling, occasionally modulating to keys containing double-sharps or double-flats, so pianists are occasionally required to come to terms with unusual keys such as E major, the enharmonic equivalent to F major, and the occasional triple-sharp.

===Works===

====Early works====
Alkan&#x27;s earliest works indicate, according to Smith, that in his early teens he &quot;was a formidable musician but as yet ... industrious rather than ... creative&quot;. Only with his 12 &quot;Caprices&quot; (Opp.12–13 and 15–16, 1837) did his compositions begin to attract serious critical attention. The Op. 15 set, &quot;Souvenirs: Trois morceaux dans le genre pathétique&quot;, dedicated to Liszt, contains &quot;Le vent (The Wind)&quot;, which was at one time the only piece by the composer to figure regularly in recitals. These works, however, did not meet with the approval of Robert Schumann, who wrote: &quot;One is startled by such false, such unnatural art ... the last [piece, titled &quot;Morte (Death)&quot;, is] a crabbed waste, overgrown with brush and weeds ... nothing is to be found but black on black&quot;. Ronald Smith, however, finds in this latter work, which cites the &quot;Dies Irae&quot; theme also used by Berlioz, Liszt and others, foreshadowings of Maurice Ravel, Modest Mussorgsky and Charles Ives. Schumann did, however, respond positively to the pieces of &quot;Les mois&quot; (originally part published as Op. 8 in 1838, later published as a complete set in 1840 as Op. 74): &quot;[Here] we find such an excellent jest on operatic music in no. 6 [&quot;L&#x27;Opéra&quot;] that a better one could scarcely be imagined ... The composer ... well understands the rarer effects of his instrument.&quot; Alkan&#x27;s technical mastery of the keyboard was asserted by the publication in 1838 of the &quot;Trois grandes études&quot; (originally without opus number, later republished as Op. 76), the first for the left hand alone, the second for the right hand alone, the third for both hands; and all of great difficulty, described by Smith as &quot;a peak of pianistic transcendentalism&quot;. This is perhaps the earliest example of writing for a single hand as &quot;an entity in its own right, capable of covering all registers of the piano, of rendering itself as accompanied soloist or polyphonist.&quot;

====Early maturity====
Alkan&#x27;s large scale &quot;Duo&quot; (in effect a sonata) Op. 21 for violin and piano (dedicated to Chrétien Urhan) and his Piano Trio Op. 30 appeared in 1841. Apart from these, Alkan published only a few minor works between 1840 and 1844, after which a series of virtuoso works was issued, many of which he had played at his successful recitals at Érard and elsewhere; these included the &quot;Marche funèbre&quot; (Op. 26), the &quot;Marche triomphale &quot; (Op. 27) and &quot;Le chemin de fer&quot; (also published, separately, as Op. 27). In 1847 appeared the Op. 31 &quot;Préludes&quot; (in all major and minor keys, with an extra closing piece returning to C major) and his first large-scale unified piano work, the Grande sonate &quot;Les quatre âges&quot; (Op. 33). The sonata is structurally innovative in two ways; each movement is slower than its predecessor, and the work anticipates the practice of progressive tonality, beginning in D major and ending in G minor. Dedicated to Alkan Morhange, the sonata depicts in its successive movements its &#x27;hero&#x27; at the ages of 20 (optimistic), 30 (&quot;Quasi-Faust&quot;, impassioned and fatalistic), 40 (domesticated) and 50 (suffering: the movement is prefaced by a quotation from Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;). In 1848 followed Alkan&#x27;s set of &quot;12 études dans tous les tons majeurs&quot; Op. 35, whose substantial pieces range in mood from the hectic &quot;Allegro barbaro&quot; (no. 5) and the intense &quot;Chant d&#x27;amour-Chant de mort (Song of Love – Song of Death)&quot; (no. 10) to the descriptive and picturesque &quot;L&#x27;incendie au village voisin (The Fire in the Next Village)&quot; (no. 7).

A number of Alkan&#x27;s compositions from this period were never performed and have been lost. Among the missing works are some string sextets and a full-scale orchestral symphony in B minor, which was described in an article in 1846 by the critic Léon Kreutzer, to whom Alkan had shown the score. Kreutzer noted that the introductory &quot;adagio&quot; of the symphony was headed &quot;by Hebrew characters in red ink ... This is no less than the verse from Genesis: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.&quot; Kreutzer opined that, set beside Alkan&#x27;s conception, Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot; was a &quot;mere candle (&quot;lampion&quot;).&quot; A further missing work is a one-act opera, mentioned frequently in the French musical press of 1846–7 as being shortly to be produced at the Opéra-Comique, which however never materialized. Alkan also referred to this work in a letter of 1847 to the musicologist François-Joseph Fétis, stating that it had been written &quot;a few years ago.&quot; Its subject, title and librettist remain unknown.

====Internal exile====
During his twenty-year absence from the public between 1853 and 1873 Alkan produced many of his most notable compositions, although there is a ten-year gap between publication of the Op. 35 studies and that of his next group of piano works in 1856 and 1857. Of these, undoubtedly the most significant was the enormous Opus 39 collection of twelve studies in all the minor keys, which contains the &quot;Symphony for Solo Piano&quot; (numbers four, five, six and seven), and the &quot;Concerto for Solo Piano&quot; (numbers eight, nine and ten). The &quot;Concerto&quot; takes nearly an hour in performance. Number twelve of Op. 39 is a set of variations, &quot;Le festin d&#x27;Ésope&quot; (&quot;Aesop&#x27;s Feast&quot;). The other components of Op. 39 are of a similar stature. Smith describes Op. 39 as a whole as &quot;a towering achievement, gathering ... the most complete manifestation of Alkan&#x27;s many-sided genius: its dark passion, its vital rhythmic drive, its pungent harmony, its occasionally outrageous humour, and, above all, its uncompromising piano writing.&quot;

In the same year appeared the &quot;Sonate de concert&quot;, Op. 47, for cello and piano, &quot;among the most difficult and ambitious in the romantic repertoire ... anticipating Mahler in its juxtaposition of the sublime and the trivial&quot;. In the opinion of the musicologist Brigitte François-Sappey, its four movements again show an anticipation of progressive tonality, each ascending by a major third. Other anticipations of Mahler (who was born in 1860) can be found in the two &quot;military&quot; Op. 50 piano studies of 1859 &quot;Capriccio alla soldatesca&quot; and &quot;Le tambour bat aux champs (The drum beats the retreat)&quot;, as well as in certain of the miniatures of the 1861 &quot;Esquisses&quot;, Op. 63. The bizarre and unclassifiable &quot;Marcia funebre, sulla morte d&#x27;un Pappagallo&quot; (&quot;Funeral march on the death of a parrot&quot;, 1859), for three oboes, bassoon and voices, described by Kenneth Hamilton as &quot;Monty-Pythonesque&quot;, is also of this period.

The &quot;Esquisses&quot; of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, &quot;Les cloches (The Bells)&quot;, to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, &quot;Les diablotins (The Imps)&quot;, and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, &quot;Laus Deo (Praise God).&quot; Like the earlier &quot;Preludes&quot; and the two sets of &quot;Etudes&quot;, they span all the major and minor keys (in this case covering each key twice, with an extra piece in C major). They were preceded in publication by Alkan&#x27;s deceptively titled &quot;Sonatine&quot;, Op. 61, in &#x27;classical&#x27; format, but a work of &quot;ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.&quot;

Two of Alkan&#x27;s substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. &quot;Salut, cendre du pauvre&quot;, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem &quot;La Mélancolie&quot; by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while &quot;Super flumina Babylonis&quot;, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (&quot;By the waters of Babylon ...&quot;). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan&#x27;s Bible translation. Alkan&#x27;s lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of &quot;Chants&quot; inspired by Mendelssohn (Opp. 38, 65, 67, and 70), which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces, such as three &quot;Nocturnes&quot;, Opp. 57 and 60bis (1859).

Alkan&#x27;s publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his &quot;Benedictus&quot;, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith&#x27;s opinion, &quot;seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space&quot;, and which he believes reveal &quot;Alkan&#x27;s essential spiritual modesty.&quot; These were followed by pieces such as the &quot;13 Prières (Prayers)&quot;, Op. 64 (1865), and the &quot;Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther &quot;Un fort rempart est notre Dieu&quot; &quot;, Op. 69 (1866). Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the &quot;Bombardo-carillon&quot; for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.

Alkan&#x27;s return to the concert platform at his &quot;Petits Concerts&quot;, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the &quot;Toccatina&quot;, Op. 75, in 1872.

==Reception and legacy==
Alkan had few followers; however, he had important admirers, including Liszt, Anton Rubinstein, Franck, and, in the early twentieth century, Busoni, Petri and Sorabji. Rubinstein dedicated his fifth piano concerto to him, and Franck dedicated to Alkan his &quot;Grand pièce symphonique&quot; op. 17 for organ. Busoni ranked Alkan with Liszt, Chopin, Schumann and Brahms as one of the five greatest composers for the piano since Beethoven. Isidor Philipp and Delaborde edited new printings of his works in the early 1900s. In the first half of the twentieth century, when Alkan&#x27;s name was still obscure, Busoni and Petri included his works in their performances. Sorabji published an article on Alkan in his 1932 book &quot;Around Music&quot;; he promoted Alkan&#x27;s music in his reviews and criticism, and his Sixth Symphony for Piano (&quot;Symphonia claviensis&quot;) (1975–76), includes a section entitled &quot;Quasi Alkan&quot;. The English composer and writer Bernard van Dieren praised Alkan in an essay in his 1935 book, &quot;Down Among the Dead Men&quot;, and the composer Humphrey Searle also called for a revival of his music in a 1937 essay. The pianist and writer Charles Rosen however considered Alkan &quot;a minor figure&quot;, whose only music of interest comes after 1850 as an extension of Liszt&#x27;s techniques and of &quot;the operatic techniques of Meyerbeer.&quot;

For much of the 20th century, Alkan&#x27;s work remained in obscurity, but from the 1960s onwards it was steadily revived. Raymond Lewenthal gave a pioneering extended broadcast on Alkan on WBAI radio in New York in 1963, and later included Alkan&#x27;s music in recitals and recordings. The English pianist Ronald Smith championed Alkan&#x27;s music through performances, recordings, a biography and the Alkan Society of which he was president for many years. Works by Alkan have also been recorded by Jack Gibbons, Marc-André Hamelin, Mark Latimer, John Ogdon, Hüseyin Sermet and Mark Viner, among many others. Ronald Stevenson composed a piano piece &quot;Festin d&#x27;Alkan&quot; (referring to Alkan&#x27;s Op. 39, no. 12) and the composer Michael Finnissy has also written piano pieces referring to Alkan, e.g. &quot;Alkan-Paganini&quot;, no. 5 of &quot;The History of Photography in Sound&quot;. Marc-André Hamelin&#x27;s &quot;Étude No. IV&quot; is a moto perpetuo study combining themes from Alkan&#x27;s Symphony, Op. 39, no. 7, and Alkan&#x27;s own perpetual motion étude, Op. 76, no. 3. It is dedicated to Averil Kovacs and François Luguenot, respectively activists in the English and French Alkan Societies. As Hamelin writes in his preface to this étude, the idea to combine these came from the composer Alistair Hinton, the finale of whose Piano Sonata No. 5 (1994–95) includes a substantial section entitled &quot;Alkanique&quot;.

Alkan&#x27;s compositions for organ have been among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire. As to Alkan&#x27;s pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.

<text>Maryanne Amacher (February 25, 1938 – October 22, 2009) was an American composer and installation artist.
She is known for working extensively with a family of psychoacoustic phenomena called auditory distortion products (also known as distortion product otoacoustic emissions and combination tones), in which the ears themselves produce audible sound.

==Biography==
Amacher was born in Kane, Pennsylvania, to an American nurse and a Swiss freight train worker. An only child, she grew up playing the piano. Amacher left Kane to attend the University of Pennsylvania on a full scholarship where she received a B.F.A in 1964. While there she studied composition with George Rochberg and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

She also studied composition in Salzburg, Austria, and Dartington, England. Subsequently, she did graduate work in acoustics and computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

While in residence at the University of Buffalo, in 1967, she created &quot;City Links: Buffalo&quot;, a 28-hour piece using 5 microphones in different parts of the city, broadcast live by radio station WBFO. There were 21 other pieces in the &quot;City Links&quot; series, and more information can be found in the brochure for an exhibition on the series by Ludlow 38 in NYC (available on their website). A common feature was the use of dedicated, FM radio quality telephone (0–15,000 Hz range) lines to connect the sound environments of different sites into the same space, a very early example of what is now called &quot;telematic performance&quot; which preceded much more famous examples by Max Neuhaus, amongst others. (Neuhaus himself was involved with the original 1967 work in Buffalo.)

Her major pieces have almost exclusively been site-specific, often using many loudspeakers to create what she called &quot;structure borne sound&quot;, differentiating it from &quot;airborne sound&quot;. By using many diffuse sound sources (either not in the space or speakers facing at the walls or floors) she would create the psychoacoustic illusions of sound shapes or &quot;presence&quot;. Amacher&#x27;s early work is best represented in three series of multimedia installations produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan: the sonic telepresence series, &quot;City Links 1–22&quot; (1967– ); the architecturally staged &quot;Music for Sound-Joined Rooms&quot; (1980– ); and the &quot;Mini-Sound Series&quot; (1985– ) a new multimedia form she created that is unique in its use of architecture and serialized narrative.

She was invited while doing a fellowship at the Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by John Cage to work on several projects. The collaboration resulted with a storm soundtrack for Cage&#x27;s multimedia &quot;Lecture on the Weather&quot; (1975) and a work on sound environment &quot;Close Up&quot; for a 10-hour solo voice work for Cage &quot;Empty Words&quot; (1978). She also produced, alongside other works, &quot;Torse&quot; for Merce Cunningham from 1974 to 1980.

Amacher worked extensively with a set of psychoacoustic phenomena known as &#x27;auditory distortion products&#x27;; put simply: sounds generated inside the ear that are clearly audible to the hearer. These tones have a long history in music theory and scientific research, and are still the object of disagreement and debate. In music, they are most commonly known by the name of &#x27;combination tones&#x27;, &#x27;difference tones&#x27;, and sometimes &#x27;Tartini tones&#x27; (after the violinist Giuseppe Tartini, who is credited with discovering them). Amacher herself termed them &#x27;ear tones&#x27; until 1992, when she discovered the work of David T. Kemp and Thomas Gold and began referring to them by the psychoacoustical terminology of &#x27;otoacoustic emissions&#x27;. It has since become clear that some of the sounds Amacher, and indeed all musicians who have exploited this phenomenon, were generating can be attributed to a particular family of otoacoustic emissions known as &#x27;distortion product otoacoustic emissions&#x27; (DPOAE). Occurring in response to two pure tones presented simultaneously to the ear, these tones appear to localise in or around the head, as though there were a &#x27;tiny loudspeaker inside the ear&#x27;. Amacher was the first to systematically explore the musical use of these phenomena using electroacoustic sound technologies. The subtitle of her first Tzadik Records album &quot;Sound Characters (Making the Third Ear)&quot; is a reference to them. She describes the subjective experience of these phenomena in the following passage:

Over the years she received several major commissions in the United States and Europe with occasional work in Asia and Central and South America. Amacher received a 1998 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. In 2005, she was awarded the Prix Ars Electronica (the Golden Nica) in the &quot;Digital Musics&quot; category for her project &quot;TEO! A sonic sculpture&quot;. In 2009 she was invited for Brückenmusik, Cologne. At the time of her death she had been working three years on a 40-channel piece commissioned by the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center in Troy, New York.

Maryanne Amacher has been an important influence for composers such as Rhys Chatham and Thurston Moore. For the last decade of her life she taught at the Bard College MFA program.

In 2020, The Music and Recorded Sound Division of The New York Public Library acquired Amacher&#x27;s archives.

<text>Emil Wolf (July 30, 1922 – June 2, 2018) was a Czech-born American physicist who made advancements in physical optics, including diffraction, coherence properties of optical fields, spectroscopy of partially coherent radiation, and the theory of direct scattering and inverse scattering. He was also the author of numerous other contributions to optics.

==Life and career==
Wolf was born into a Jewish family in Prague, Czechoslovakia. He was forced to leave his native country when the Germans invaded. After brief periods in Italy and France (where he worked for the Czech government in exile), he moved to the United Kingdom in 1940. He received his B.Sc. in Mathematics and Physics (1945), and Ph.D. in Mathematics from Bristol University, England, in 1948. Between 1951 and 1954 he worked at the University of Edinburgh with Max Born, writing the famous textbook &quot;Principles of Optics&quot; now usually known simply as &quot;Born and Wolf&quot;. After a period on the Faculty of the University of Manchester, he moved to the United States in 1959 to take a position at the University of Rochester. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen and was the Wilson Professor of Optical Physics at the University of Rochester. He was president of the Optical Society of America in 1978. Until his death Wolf resided in Cloverwood in Pittsford, New York, with his wife.

Wolf predicted a new mechanism that produces redshift and blueshift, that is not due to moving sources (Doppler effect), that has subsequently been confirmed experimentally (called the Wolf effect). Technically, he found that two non-Lambertian sources that emit beamed energy, can interact in a way that causes a shift in the spectral lines. It is analogous to a pair of tuning forks with similar frequencies (pitches), connected together mechanically with a sounding board; there is a strong coupling that results in the resonant frequencies getting &quot;dragged down&quot; in pitch. The Wolf effect can produce either redshifts or blueshifts, depending on the observer&#x27;s point of view, but is redshifted when the observer is head-on. A subsequent 1999 article by Sisir Roy &quot;et al.&quot; have suggested that the Wolf effect may explain discordant redshift in certain quasars.

Wolf remained an active teacher, researcher and author well into his 80s. He died on June 2, 2018, aged 95.

==Works==
Wolf was a very well known book author in the field of optics. Along with Max Born, he co-wrote &quot;Principles of Optics&quot; one of the standard textbooks of optics commonly known as &quot;Born and Wolf&quot;. In addition he co-authored, with Leonard Mandel, &quot;Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics&quot;. He also authored &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Coherence and Polarization of Light&quot; and &quot;Selected Works of Emil Wolf with Commentary&quot; (World Scientific Publishing, 2001, ). Furthermore, he edited the &quot;Progress in Optics&quot; series of books, for Elsevier, from its inception in 1962.

<doc id="439475" wikidata="Q318633" url="?curid=439475" title="Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli">
<text>Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli (; 5 January 1920 – 12 June 1995) was an Italian classical pianist. He is considered one of the greatest pianists of the twentieth century. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he was perhaps the most reclusive, enigmatic and obsessive among the handful of the world&#x27;s legendary pianists.

== Early life and studies ==
Benedetti Michelangeli was born near Brescia, in Italy. His date of birth is usually given as 5 January 1920. He himself once said that he was born &#x27;during the first hour of the morning of 6 January 1920&#x27;. His father, who was a count and a lawyer by profession, was also a musician and a composer and began teaching music to Benedetti Michelangeli before he was four years old. Benedetti Michelangeli learned to play the violin at the age of three and would later study the instrument at the Venturi Institute in Brescia before switching to piano under Dr. Paolo Chimeri, who accepted him into his class following an audition. He also studied organ and composition. When he was nine, he began having private lessons with Giovanni Anfossi in Milan.

At ten years old, Benedetti Michelangeli began his formal music education at the Milan Conservatory, where he graduated with honours at the age of 14. Although Benedetti Michelangeli&#x27;s parents were passionate about music, they did not want Arturo to become a pianist. In view of his family&#x27;s attitude Benedetti Michelangeli studied medicine for several years although he never set music aside and continued to play regularly.

== Professional career ==

In May 1938, at the age of eighteen, Michelangeli began his international career by entering the Ysaÿe International Festival in Brussels, Belgium, where he finished seventh. A brief account of the competition, at which Emil Gilels took first prize and Moura Lympany second, is given by Arthur Rubinstein, who was one of the judges. According to Rubinstein, Benedetti Michelangeli gave &quot;an unsatisfactory performance, but already showed his impeccable technique.&quot; A year later he won the first prize in the Geneva International Music Competition, where he was acclaimed as &quot;a new Liszt&quot; by pianist Alfred Cortot, a member of the judging panel, which was presided over by Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Upon winning the competition, Benito Mussolini gave Michelangeli a teaching position at the Martini Conservatory in Bologna, Italy.

The outbreak of World War II interrupted Michelangeli&#x27;s career just as it had begun. Despite future Queen of Italy Maria José Savoia&#x27;s efforts to exonerate him from the army, Michelangeli was drafted. He joined the Italian airforce, and as soon as the war was over, returned to music. After a long break, his first appearance was in Warsaw during the 5th Chopin Festival, where he dropped out of the competition in protest as Vladimir Ashkenazy, who he believed should have won, finished second to Adam Harasiewicz by a small margin. In 1948 Michelangeli toured the United States for the first time, making his orchestral debut at Carnegie Hall in November, performing Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 54 with the New York Philharmonic and Dimitri Mitropoulos. In January 1949 he made his solo debut at Carnegie Hall. Following his spell at Conservatorio in Bologna, Michelangeli&#x27;s teaching activity continued in Venice, Berlin, Geneva and Budapest. His concept of training students to become professional piano concertists was unorthodox but successful, and he taught for several years in Bozen, and from 1952 to 1964 in Arezzo (with a break caused by ill health between 1953 and 1955). The courses eventually resulted in the foundation of the Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli International Piano Academy, which was to be organized by the city and provincial authorities in Arezzo, in cooperation with the &#x27;Amici della Musica&#x27; Society. Unfortunately, the project did not come to fruition. He ran further courses in Moncalieri, Siena, and Lugano, and from 1967 he gave private tuitions at a Rabbi in his Alpine villa in the province of Trento.

In 1988, Michelangeli suffered a ruptured abdominal aneurysm during a concert in Bordeaux. After more than seven hours of surgery, he overcame this health issue. A few months later, on 7 June 1989, he played Mozart concertos Nos. 20 and 25 with the Symphony Orchestra of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) conducted by Cord Garben. In 1990, he again recorded two Mozart concertos, KV. 415 and KV. 503 in Bremen. Michelangeli&#x27;s last public performance was held in Hamburg on 7 May 1993.

As a composer, Benedetti Michelangeli arranged 19 Italian folk songs a cappella for the &quot;Coro della Società Alpinisti Tridentini&quot; and a men&#x27;s chorus from Trento (Italy). A recording of these pieces are available on the DIVOX music label.

Benedetti Michelangeli&#x27;s students included Maurizio Pollini, Martha Argerich, Ivan Moravec, Paul Stewart, Aldo Antognazzi, Vladimir Krpan, Lucia Passaglia and Carlo Dominici.

Sergiu Celibidache considered Benedetti Michelangeli a fellow conductor, and not merely a pianist: &quot;Michelangeli makes colors; he is a conductor.&quot; Celibidache also described Michelangeli as one of the &quot;greatest living artists&quot;.

Teacher and commentator David Dubal argued that Benedetti Michelangeli was at his best when he performed the earlier works of Beethoven but seemed insecure with Chopin. He added that Benedetti Michelangeli was &quot;demonic&quot; in works such as the Bach-Busoni &quot;Chaconne&quot; and Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Paganini Variations&quot;.

Benedetti Michelangeli&#x27;s highlights include the (authorized) live performances in London of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;, Chopin&#x27;s Mazurkas and Sonata No. 2, Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Carnaval&quot;, Op. 9 and &quot;Faschingsschwank aus Wien&quot;, Op. 26 as well as various recordings of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5, Liszt&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 and Totentanz, and the piano concertos of Robert Schumann, and Edvard Grieg.

== Personal life ==
On 20 September 1943 Benedetti Michelangeli married pianist Giulia Linda Guidetti, who was a pupil of his father. They lived in Bornato, near Brescia, Bolzano and Arezzo. They separated in 1970. In the 1970s Michelangeli lived in Switzerland and refused to live or perform in his native Italy for over a decade.

Following his divorce, his secretary, and later his agent and partner, Marie-José Gros-Dubois organized concerts and dates for him, and also presided over his financial affairs.

In an interview, Gros-Dubois recalled that Benedetti Michelangeli could not believe his musical career was so financially successful. After a concert, she reported that he gloomily said: &quot;You see, so much applause, so much public. Then, in half an hour, you feel alone more than before.&quot;

Benedetti Michelangeli was a connoisseur of the piano mechanics and insisted for his concert instruments to be in perfect condition. His last concert took place on 7 May 1993 in Hamburg, Germany. After a long illness he died on 12 June 1995 in Lugano, Switzerland. He is buried in nearby Pura.

== Racing career ==
Michelangeli was a three-time competitor in the Mille Miglia road race.

== Awards and recognition ==
*Queen Elisabeth Competition: Seventh Prize (1938)
*Geneva International Competition: First Prize (1939)
*15th Annual Grammy Awards Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (Without Orchestra): Nomination (1972)
::Debussy: Images, Books 1 And 2 and Children&#x27;s Corner Suite (Album) 
*18th Annual Grammy Awards Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (Without Orchestra): Nomination (1975)
::Schumann: Carnaval, Op. 9 (Album)

Michelangeli was chosen by an international panel as the official pianist for the 100th anniversary of Chopin&#x27;s death (1949).

== The International Piano Festival of Brescia and Bergamo ==
In 1962, the &#x27;Amici della Musica&#x27; Society in Arezzo organized the first Benedetti Michelangeli Festival. Michelangeli&#x27;s pupils took part, giving concerts in various locations in Tuscany. The festival concluded with a performance in Arezzo by Michelangeli himself. A similar event took place the following year.

In 1964, Benedetti Michelangeli founded the International Piano Festival of Brescia and Bergamo – one of the major world events dedicated to piano music, intended both as a solo instrument and as an orchestra interlocutor.

From 1964, the festival moved to Brescia and Bergamo, and Michelangeli remained its artistic director for about three years. Pianists appearing at the festival include Magaloff, Richter, Arrau, Pollini, Ashkenazy, Radu Lupu, Zimerman, Brendel, Martha Argerich, Evgeny Kissin, Grigory Sokolov, and instrumentalists, singers and conductors such as Mstislav Rostropovich, Mischa Maisky, Uto Ughi, Luciano Pavarotti, Riccardo Muti, Claudio Abbado, Gergiev, Giulini, Sawallisch, Solti, Maazel and Chung.

<text>Jean-Pierre Vigier (16 January 19204 May 2004) was a French theoretical physicist, known for his work on the foundations of physics, in particular on his stochastic interpretation of quantum physics.

==Education==
A native of Paris, Vigier earned his PhD in mathematics from University of Geneva in 1946 with a study on &quot;Infinite Sequences of Hermitian Operators&quot;. In 1948 he was appointed assistant to Louis de Broglie, a position he held until the latter&#x27;s retirement in 1962. Vigier was professor emeritus in the Department of Gravitational Physics at &quot;Pierre et Marie Curie University&quot; in Paris. He authored more than 300 scientific papers, and co-authored and edited a number of books and conference proceedings. He was a member of the editorial board of &quot;Physics Letters A&quot;.

Vigier was a proponent of the stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics, which was based on the ideas of de Broglie and David Bohm. Politically, Vigier was an active supporter of communism throughout his life.

Vigier was invited to be Einstein&#x27;s assistant; but at the time because of his political controversy related to Vietnam the United States Department of State would not allow him entry into the United States.

Vigier died in 2004 in Paris.

==Family==
Vigier&#x27;s father was a professor of English, such that Vigier became fluent in English and French, his native language.

<text>Oscar William Kapell (September 20, 1922 – October 29, 1953) was an American classical pianist. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described him as &quot;America&#x27;s first great pianist&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;one of the last century&#x27;s great geniuses of the keyboard&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; critic and pianist Michael Kimmelman, writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, remarked: &quot;Was there any greater American pianist born during the last century than Kapell? Perhaps not.&quot; In 1953, at age 31, Kapell died in the crash of BCPA Flight 304 while returning from a concert tour in Australia.

==Biography==

William Kapell was born in New York City on September 20, 1922, and grew up in the eastside neighborhood of Yorkville, Manhattan, where his parents owned a Lexington Avenue bookstore. His father was of Spanish-Russian Jewish ancestry and his mother of Polish descent. Dorothea Anderson La Follette (the wife of Chester La Follette) met Kapell at the Third Street Music School and became his teacher, giving him lessons several times a week at her studio on West 64th Street. Kapell later studied with Olga Samaroff, former wife of conductor Leopold Stokowski, at the Juilliard School.

Kapell won his first competition at the age of ten and received as a prize a turkey dinner with the pianist José Iturbi. In 1941, he won the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s youth competition as well as the Naumburg Award. The following year, the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation sponsored the 19-year-old pianist&#x27;s New York début, a recital which won him the Town Hall Award for the year&#x27;s outstanding concert by a musician under 30. He was signed to an exclusive recording contract with RCA Victor.

Kapell achieved fame while in his early twenties, in part as a result of his performances of Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s Piano Concerto in D-flat. His 1946 world premiere recording of the piece with Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra was a sell-out hit. Eventually, he became so associated with the work that he was referred to in some circles as &quot;Khachaturian Kapell.&quot; Besides his pianism and technical gifts, Kapell&#x27;s attractive appearance and mop of black hair helped make him a favorite with the public.

By the late 1940s, Kapell had toured the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia to acclaim and praised as the most brilliant and audacious of his generation of young American pianists. On May 18, 1948, he married Rebecca Anna Lou Melson, with whom he had two children. She was a pianist herself, having been a student of Sergei Tarnowsky, the teacher of Vladimir Horowitz.

Early on, there was a tendency to typecast Kapell as a performer of technically difficult repertoire. While his technique was exceptional, he was a versatile musician, and was impatient with what he considered shallow or sloppy music making. His own repertoire was diverse, encompassing works from J. S. Bach to Aaron Copland, who so admired Kapell&#x27;s performances of his Piano Sonata that he was writing a new work for him at the time of the pianist&#x27;s death. Kapell practiced up to eight hours a day, keeping track of his sessions with a notebook and clock. He also set aside time from his busy concert schedule to work with the musicians he most admired, including Artur Schnabel, Pablo Casals, and Rudolf Serkin. Kapell also approached Arthur Rubinstein and Vladimir Horowitz (whose East 94th Street townhouse was diagonally across the street from the Kapells&#x27; apartment) for lessons, but they demurred. Horowitz later commented that there was nothing he could have taught Kapell.

== Health, death and aftermath ==
Kapell suffered from asthma and rheumatic fever during his life. In 1952, Kapell reportedly suffered from a serious lung condition. He was diagnosed with bronchitis in April and a doctor advised him to stop playing. In August, he wrote in his diary to tend to a &quot;lung condition – immediately&quot;. Three months prior, in May, he allegedly told Anthony Harris, a pianist from Sacramento who he had dinner with, that he was suffering from cancer and that the doctors had given him two years to live.

From August to October 1953, Kapell toured Australia, playing 37 concerts in 14 weeks. He appeared in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Bendigo, Shepparton, Albury, Horsham and finally in Geelong. Kapell played the final concert of his Australian tour in Geelong, Victoria, on October 22, 1953, a recital which included a performance of Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March&quot; Sonata. Days after the concert, he set off on his return flight to the United States, telling reporters at Mascot Airport he would never return to Australia because of the harsh comments from some Australian critics. He was aboard BCPA Flight 304 when on the morning of October 29, 1953, the plane, descending to land in fog, struck the treetops and crashed on Kings Mountain, south of the San Francisco airport. Everyone on board died. His friend, broadcaster Alistair Cooke, covered Kapell&#x27;s death in his &quot;Letter from America&quot; on October 30, 1953. On November 2, Kapell&#x27;s funeral took place at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York; interment followed at the Mount Ararat Cemetery near Farmingdale, New York.

Musician Isaac Stern set up the William Kapell Memorial Fund to bring musicians to the United States for wider experience. The Australian violinist Ernest Llewellyn, a friend of Stern&#x27;s, was the inaugural recipient in 1955.

Pianists including Eugene Istomin, Gary Graffman, Leon Fleisher and Van Cliburn have acknowledged Kapell&#x27;s influence. Fleisher stated that Kapell was &quot;the greatest pianistic talent that this country has ever produced&quot;. Kapell&#x27;s widow, Anna Lou Dehavenon (1926–2012), undertook a career as an expert on homelessness in New York in part as a result, she said, of her own experience of suddenly becoming a single mother with no income. For the rest of her life she worked to keep her late husband&#x27;s recordings before the public.

Kapell&#x27;s estate sued BCPA, Qantas (which had taken over BCPA in 1954), and BOAC (which was alleged to have sold Kapell the ticket). In 1964, more than ten years after the crash, Kapell&#x27;s widow and two children were awarded US$924,396 in damages. The award was overturned on appeal in 1965.

==Kapell International Piano Competition and Festival==
In 1986, the University of Maryland&#x27;s piano competition was renamed the William Kapell International Piano Competition in Kapell&#x27;s honor. It became quadrennial in 1998 and is currently held at the university&#x27;s Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center.

==Recordings==

In 1944, Kapell signed an exclusive recording contract with RCA Victor. Many of his recordings were originally issued as 78RPM records. Some were issued on LP, but by 1960, all of Kapell&#x27;s commercial recordings were out of print. In 1962, RCA Victor reissued the Kapell/Koussevitzky recording of the Khachaturian Piano Concerto. Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 were reissued on the RCA Victrola label in 1970. For decades, pirated copies of the Kapell&#x27;s commercial RCA Victor recordings and unlicensed recordings of &quot;live&quot; performances circulated among collectors.

In the 1980s, RCA Victor issued two compact discs of Kapell&#x27;s recordings, including the Khatchaturian and Prokofiev Third Piano Concertos, and an all-Chopin disc.

A 9 CD set released by RCA Victor in 1998 contains Kapell&#x27;s complete authorized recordings, including renditions of Chopin&#x27;s mazurkas and sonatas as well as concertos by Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, and Khatchaturian. It also has many lesser-known items, some of them first releases, including Shostakovich preludes, Scarlatti sonatas, and the Copland Piano Sonata. The set sold well throughout the world and brought Kapell&#x27;s work to a new audience.

VAI 1027 contains broadcast recordings of the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 and the Khatchaturian Piano Concerto. Arbiter 108 features part of the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 3 and the Shostakovich Concerto No. 1, and it includes Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, which also appears in the RCA Victor set, as well as on VAI 1048, the last from an Australian recital of July 21, 1953.

In 2004, a number of broadcast recordings made during William Kapell&#x27;s last Australian tour were returned to his family. RCA Victor issued these recordings in 2008 under the title &quot;Kapell Rediscovered&quot;. Included are several previously unknown performances of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Suite bergamasque&quot;, Chopin&#x27;s Barcarolle, Op. 60, and Scherzo No. 1 in B minor, Op. 20, and Prokofiev&#x27;s Sonata No. 7, Op. 83.
In 2013, RCA issued a new 11 CD set of Kapell&#x27;s complete recordings, including the broadcast recordings from the final Australian tour.

<text>A commitment scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. Commitment schemes are designed so that a party cannot change the value or statement after they have committed to it: that is, commitment schemes are &quot;binding&quot;. Commitment schemes have important applications in a number of cryptographic protocols including secure coin flipping, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure computation.

A way to visualize a commitment scheme is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box, and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves. Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be changed—merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the key at some later time.

Interactions in a commitment scheme take place in two phases:

# the &quot;commit phase&quot; during which a value is chosen and committed to
# the &quot;reveal phase&quot; during which the value is revealed by the sender, then the receiver verifies its authenticity

In the above metaphor, the commit phase is the sender putting the message in the box, and locking it. The reveal phase is the sender giving the key to the receiver, who uses it to open the box and verify its contents. The locked box is the commitment, and the key is the proof.

In simple protocols, the commit phase consists of a single message from the sender to the receiver. This message is called &quot;the commitment&quot;. It is essential that the specific value chosen cannot be extracted from the message by the receiver at that time (this is called the &quot;hiding&quot; property). A simple reveal phase would consist of a single message, &quot;the opening&quot;, from the sender to the receiver, followed by a check performed by the receiver. The value chosen during the commit phase must be the only one that the sender can compute and that validates during the reveal phase (this is called the &quot;binding&quot; property).

The concept of commitment schemes was perhaps first formalized by Gilles Brassard, David Chaum, and Claude Crépeau in 1988, as part of various zero-knowledge protocols for NP, based on various types of commitment schemes. But the concept was used prior to that without being treated formally. The notion of commitments appeared earliest in works by Manuel Blum, Shimon Even, and Adi Shamir et al. The terminology seems to have been originated by Blum, although commitment schemes can be interchangeably called bit commitment schemes—sometimes reserved for the special case where the committed value is a bit. Prior to that, commitment via one-way hash functions was considered, e.g., as part of, say, Lamport signature, the original one-time one-bit signature scheme.

==Applications==

===Coin flipping===

Suppose Alice and Bob want to resolve some dispute via coin flipping. If they are physically in the same place, a typical procedure might be:

# Alice &quot;calls&quot; the coin flip,
# Bob flips the coin,
# If Alice&#x27;s call is correct, she wins, otherwise Bob wins.

If Alice and Bob are not in the same place a problem arises. Once Alice has &quot;called&quot; the coin flip, Bob can stipulate the flip &quot;results&quot; to be whatever is most desirable for him. Similarly, if Alice doesn&#x27;t announce her &quot;call&quot; to Bob, after Bob flips the coin and announces the result, Alice can report that she called whatever result is most desirable for her. Alice and Bob can use commitments in a procedure that will allow both to trust the outcome:

# Alice &quot;calls&quot; the coin flip but only tells Bob a &quot;commitment&quot; to her call,
# Bob flips the coin and reports the result,
# Alice reveals what she committed to,
# Bob verifies that Alice&#x27;s call matches her commitment,
# If Alice&#x27;s revelation matches the coin result Bob reported, Alice wins.

For Bob to be able to skew the results to his favor, he must be able to understand the call hidden in Alice&#x27;s commitment. If the commitment scheme is a good one, Bob cannot skew the results. Similarly, Alice cannot affect the result if she cannot change the value she commits to.

A real-life application of this problem exists, when people (often in media) commit to a decision or give an answer in a &quot;sealed envelope&quot;, which is then opened later. &quot;Let&#x27;s find out if that&#x27;s what the candidate answered&quot;, for example on a game show, can serve as a model of this system.

===Zero-knowledge proofs===

One particular motivating example is the use of commitment schemes in zero-knowledge proofs. Commitments are used in zero-knowledge proofs for two main purposes: first, to allow the prover to participate in &quot;cut and choose&quot; proofs where the verifier will be presented with a choice of what to learn, and the prover will reveal only what corresponds to the verifier&#x27;s choice. Commitment schemes allow the prover to specify all the information in advance, and only reveal what should be revealed later in the proof. 
Second, commitments are also used in zero-knowledge proofs by the verifier, who will often specify their choices ahead of time in a commitment. This allows zero-knowledge proofs to be composed in parallel without revealing additional information to the prover.

===Signature schemes===
The Lamport signature scheme is a digital signature system that relies on maintaining two sets of secret data packets, publishing verifiable hashes of the data packets, and then selectively revealing partial secret data packets in a manner that conforms specifically to the data to be signed. In this way, the prior public commitment to the secret values becomes a critical part of the functioning of the system.

Because the Lamport signature system cannot be used more than once, a system to combine many Lamport key-sets under a single public value that can be tied to a person and verified by others was developed. This system uses trees of hashes to compress many published Lamport-key-commitment sets into a single hash value that can be associated with the prospective author of later-verified data.

=== Verifiable secret sharing ===
Another important application of commitments is in verifiable secret sharing, a critical building block of secure multiparty computation. In a secret sharing scheme, each of several parties receive &quot;shares&quot; of a value that is meant to be hidden from everyone. If enough parties get together, their shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but even a malicious cabal of insufficient size should learn nothing. Secret sharing is at the root of many protocols for secure computation: in order to securely compute a function of some shared input, the secret shares are manipulated instead. However, if shares are to be generated by malicious parties, it may be important that those shares can be checked for correctness. In a verifiable secret sharing scheme, the distribution of a secret is accompanied by commitments to the individual shares. The commitments reveal nothing that can help a dishonest cabal, but the shares allow each individual party to check to see if their shares are correct.

==Defining the security==

Formal definitions of commitment schemes vary strongly in notation and in flavour. The first such flavour is whether the commitment scheme provides perfect or computational security with respect to the hiding or binding properties. Another such flavour is whether the commitment is interactive, i.e. whether both the commit phase and the reveal phase can be seen as being executed by a cryptographic protocol or whether they are non-interactive, consisting of two algorithms &quot;Commit&quot; and &quot;CheckReveal&quot;. In the latter case &quot;CheckReveal&quot; can often be seen as a derandomised version of &quot;Commit&quot;, with the randomness used by &quot;Commit&quot; constituting the opening information.

If the commitment &quot;C&quot; to a value &quot;x&quot; is computed as &quot;C:=Commit(x,open)&quot; with &quot;open&quot; being the randomness used for computing the commitment, then &quot;CheckReveal (C,x,open)&quot; reduces to simply verifying the equation &quot;C=Commit (x,open)&quot;.

Using this notation and some knowledge about mathematical functions and probability theory we formalise different versions of the binding and hiding properties of commitments. The two most important combinations of these properties are perfectly binding and computationally hiding commitment schemes and computationally binding and perfectly hiding commitment schemes. Note that no commitment scheme can be at the same time perfectly binding and perfectly hiding – a computationally unbounded adversary can simply generate &quot;Commit(x,open)&quot; for every value of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;open&quot; until finding a pair that outputs &quot;C&quot;, and in a perfectly binding scheme this uniquely identifies &quot;x&quot;.

===Computational binding===
Let &quot;open&quot; be chosen from a set of size formula_1, i.e., it can be represented as a &quot;k&quot; bit string, and let formula_2 be the corresponding commitment scheme. As the size of &quot;k&quot; determines the security of the commitment scheme it is called the security parameter.

Then for all non-uniform probabilistic polynomial time algorithms that output formula_3 and formula_4 of increasing length &quot;k&quot;, the probability that formula_5 and formula_6 is a negligible function in &quot;k&quot;.

This is a form of asymptotic analysis. It is also possible to state the same requirement using concrete security: A commitment scheme &quot;Commit&quot; is formula_7 secure, if for all algorithms that run in time &quot;t&quot; and output formula_8 the probability that formula_5 and formula_10 is at most formula_11.

===Perfect, statistical, and computational hiding===

Let formula_12 be the uniform distribution over the formula_1 opening values for security parameter &quot;k&quot;. A commitment scheme is respectively perfect, statistical, or computational hiding, if for all formula_14 the probability ensembles formula_15 and formula_16 are equal, statistically close, or computationally indistinguishable.

===Impossibility of universally composable commitment schemes===

It is impossible to realize commitment schemes in the universal composability
(UC) framework. The reason is that UC commitment has to be &quot;extractable&quot;, as shown by Canetti and Fischlin and explained below.

The ideal commitment functionality, denoted here by &quot;F&quot;, works roughly as follows. Committer &quot;C&quot; sends value &quot;m&quot; to &quot;F&quot;, which
stores it and sends &quot;receipt&quot; to receiver &quot;R&quot;. Later, &quot;C&quot; sends &quot;open&quot; to
&quot;F&quot;, which sends &quot;m&quot; to &quot;R&quot;.

Now, assume we have a protocol &quot;π&quot; that realizes this functionality. Suppose that the committer &quot;C&quot; is corrupted. In the UC framework, that essentially means that &quot;C&quot; is now controlled by the environment, which attempts to distinguish protocol execution from the ideal process. Consider an environment that chooses a message &quot;m&quot; and then tells &quot;C&quot; to act as prescribed by &quot;π&quot;, as if it has committed to &quot;m&quot;. Note here that in order to realize &quot;F&quot;, the receiver must, after receiving a commitment, output a message &quot;receipt&quot;. After the environment sees this message, it tells &quot;C&quot; to open the commitment.

The protocol is only secure if this scenario is indistinguishable from the ideal case, where the functionality interacts with a simulator &quot;S&quot;. Here, &quot;S&quot; has control of &quot;C&quot;. In particular, whenever &quot;R&quot; outputs &quot;receipt&quot;, &quot;F&quot; has to do likewise. The only way to do that is for &quot;S&quot; to tell &quot;C&quot; to send a value to &quot;F&quot;. However, note
that by this point, &quot;m&quot; is not known to &quot;S&quot;. Hence, when the commitment is opened during protocol execution, it is unlikely that &quot;F&quot; will open to &quot;m&quot;, unless &quot;S&quot; can extract &quot;m&quot; from the messages it received from the environment before &quot;R&quot; outputs the receipt.

However a protocol that is extractable in this sense cannot be statistically hiding. Suppose such a simulator &quot;S&quot; exists. Now consider an
environment that, instead of corrupting &quot;C&quot;, corrupts &quot;R&quot; instead. Additionally it runs a copy of &quot;S&quot;. Messages received from &quot;C&quot; are fed into &quot;S&quot;, and replies from &quot;S&quot; are forwarded to &quot;C&quot;.

The environment initially tells &quot;C&quot; to commit to a message &quot;m&quot;. At some point in the interaction, &quot;S&quot; will commit to a value &quot;m′&quot;. This message is handed to &quot;R&quot;, who outputs &quot;m′&quot;. Note that by assumption we have &quot;m&#x27; = m&quot; with high probability. Now in the ideal process the simulator has to come up with &quot;m&quot;. But this is impossible, because at this point the commitment has not been opened yet, so the only message &quot;R&quot; can have received in the ideal process is a &quot;receipt&quot; message. We thus have a contradiction.

==Construction==

A commitment scheme can either be perfectly binding (it is impossible for Alice to alter her commitment after she has made it, even if she has unbounded computational resources); or perfectly concealing (it is impossible for Bob to find out the commitment without Alice revealing it, even if he has unbounded computational resources); or formulated as an instance-dependent commitment scheme, which is either hiding or binding depending on the solution to another problem. A commitment scheme cannot be both perfectly hiding and perfectly binding at the same time.

===Bit-commitment in the random oracle model===

Bit-commitment schemes are trivial to construct in the random oracle model. Given a hash function H with a 3&quot;k&quot; bit output, to commit the &quot;k&quot;-bit message &quot;m&quot;, Alice generates a random &quot;k&quot; bit string &quot;R&quot; and sends Bob H(&quot;R&quot; || &quot;m&quot;). The probability that any &quot;R′&quot;, &quot;m′&quot; exist where &quot;m′&quot; ≠ &quot;m&quot; such that H(&quot;R′&quot; || &quot;m′&quot;) = H(&quot;R&quot; || &quot;m&quot;) is ≈ 2−&quot;k&quot;, but to test any guess at the message &quot;m&quot; Bob will need to make 2&quot;k&quot; (for an incorrect guess) or 2&quot;k&quot;-1 (on average, for a correct guess) queries to the random oracle. We note that earlier schemes based on hash functions, essentially can be thought of schemes based on idealization of these hash functions as random oracle.

===Bit-commitment from any one-way permutation===

One can create a bit-commitment scheme from any one-way function that is injective. The scheme relies on the fact that every one-way function can be modified (via the Goldreich-Levin theorem) to possess a computationally hard-core predicate (while retaining the injective property).

Let &quot;f&quot; be an injective one-way function, with &quot;h&quot; a hard-core predicate. Then to commit to a bit &quot;b&quot; Alice picks a random input &quot;x&quot; and sends the triple
:formula_17
to Bob, where formula_18 denotes XOR, &quot;i.e.&quot;, bitwise addition modulo 2. To decommit, Alice simply sends &quot;x&quot; to Bob. Bob verifies by computing &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and comparing to the committed value. This scheme is concealing because for Bob to recover &quot;b&quot; he must recover &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Since &quot;h&quot; is a computationally hard-core predicate, recovering &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) from &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) with probability greater than one-half is as hard as inverting &quot;f&quot;. Perfect binding follows from the fact that &quot;f&quot; is injective and thus &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has exactly one preimage.

===Bit-commitment from a pseudo-random generator===

Note that since we do not know how to construct a one-way permutation from any one-way function, this section reduces the strength of the cryptographic assumption necessary to construct a bit-commitment protocol.

In 1991 Moni Naor showed how to create a bit-commitment scheme from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. The construction is as follows. If &quot;G&quot; is a pseudo-random generator such that &quot;G&quot; takes &quot;n&quot; bits to 3&quot;n&quot; bits, then if Alice wants to commit to a bit &quot;b&quot;:

*Bob selects a random 3&quot;n&quot;-bit vector &quot;R&quot; and sends &quot;R&quot; to Alice.
*Alice selects a random &quot;n&quot;-bit vector &quot;Y&quot; and computes the 3&quot;n&quot;-bit vector &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;).
*If &quot;b&quot;=1 Alice sends &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) to Bob, otherwise she sends the bitwise exclusive-or of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) and &quot;R&quot; to Bob.

To decommit Alice sends &quot;Y&quot; to Bob, who can then check whether he initially received &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) or &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) formula_18 &quot;R&quot;.

This scheme is statistically binding, meaning that even if Alice is computationally unbounded she cannot cheat with probability greater than 2−&quot;n&quot;. For Alice to cheat, she would need to find a &quot;Y&#x27;&quot;, such that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&#x27;&quot;) = &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) formula_18 &quot;R&quot;. If she could find such a value, she could decommit by sending the truth and &quot;Y&quot;, or send the opposite answer and &quot;Y&#x27;&quot;. However, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;&#x27;) are only able to produce 2&quot;n&quot; possible values each (that&#x27;s 22&quot;n&quot;) while &quot;R&quot; is picked out of 23&quot;n&quot; values. She does not pick &quot;R&quot;, so there is a 22&quot;n&quot;/23&quot;n&quot; = 2−&quot;n&quot; probability that a &quot;Y&#x27;&quot; satisfying the equation required to cheat will exist.

The concealing property follows from a standard reduction, if Bob can tell whether Alice committed to a zero or one, he can also distinguish the output of the pseudo-random generator &quot;G&quot; from true-random, which contradicts the cryptographic security of &quot;G&quot;.

===A perfectly binding scheme based on the discrete log problem and beyond===

Alice chooses a ring of prime order &quot;p&quot;, with multiplicative generator &quot;g&quot;.

Alice randomly picks a secret value &quot;x&quot; from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;p&quot; − 1 to commit to and calculates &quot;c&quot; = &quot;g&quot;&quot;x&quot; and publishes &quot;c&quot;. The discrete logarithm problem dictates that from &quot;c&quot;, it is computationally infeasible to compute &quot;x&quot;, so under this assumption, Bob cannot compute &quot;x&quot;. On the other hand, Alice cannot compute a &quot;x&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;x&quot;, such that &quot;g&quot;&quot;x&quot; = &quot;c&quot;, so the scheme is binding.

This scheme isn&#x27;t perfectly concealing as someone could find the commitment if he manages to solve the discrete logarithm problem. In fact, this scheme isn&#x27;t hiding at all with respect to the standard hiding game, where an adversary should be unable to guess which of two messages he chose were committed to - similar to the IND-CPA game. One consequence of this is that if the space of possible values of &quot;x&quot; is small, then an attacker could simply try them all and the commitment would not be hiding.

A better example of a perfectly binding commitment scheme is one where the commitment is the encryption of &quot;x&quot; under a semantically secure, public-key encryption scheme with perfect completeness, and the decommitment is the string of random bits used to encrypt &quot;x&quot;. An example of an information-theoretically hiding commitment scheme is the Pedersen commitment scheme, which is computationally binding under the discrete logarithm assumption.

Additionally to the scheme above, it uses another generator &quot;h&quot; of the prime group and a random number &quot;r&quot;. The commitment is set formula_21.

These constructions are tightly related to and based on the algebraic properties of the underlying groups, and the notion originally seemed to be very much related to the algebra. However, it was shown that basing statistically binding commitment schemes on general unstructured assumption is possible, via the notion of interactive hashing 
for commitments from general complexity assumptions (specifically and originally, based on any one way permutation) as in.

===A perfectly hiding commitment scheme based on RSA===

Alice selects formula_22 such that formula_23, where formula_24 and formula_25 are large secret prime numbers. Additionally, she selects a prime formula_26 such that formula_27 and formula_28. Alice then computes a public number formula_29 as an element of maximum order in the formula_30 group. Finally, Alice commits to her secret formula_31 by first generating a random number formula_32 from formula_30 and then by computing formula_34.

The security of the above commitment relies on the hardness of the RSA problem and has perfect hiding and computational binding.

===Additive and multiplicative homomorphic properties of commitments===

The Pedersen commitment scheme introduces an interesting homomorphic property that allows performing addition between two commitments. More specifically, given two messages formula_35 and formula_36 and randomness formula_37 and formula_38, respectively, it is possible to generate a new commitment such that: formula_39. Formally:

formula_40

To open the above Pedersen commitment to a new message formula_41, the randomness formula_37 and formula_38 has to be added.

Similarly, the RSA-based commitment mentioned above has a homomorphic property with respect to the multiplication operation. Given two messages formula_35 and formula_36 with randomness formula_37 and formula_38, respectively, one can compute: formula_48. Formally:
formula_49.

To open the above commitment to a new message formula_50, the randomness formula_37 and formula_38 has to be added. This newly generated commitment is distributed similarly to a new commitment to formula_53.

==Partial reveal==
Some commitment schemes permit a proof to be given of only a portion of the committed value. In these schemes, the secret value formula_54 is a vector of many individually separable values.
:formula_55
The commitment formula_56 is computed from formula_54 in the commit phase. Normally, in the reveal phase, the prover would reveal all of formula_54 and some additional proof data (such as formula_59 in simple bit-commitment). Instead, the prover is able to reveal any single value from the formula_54 vector, and create an efficient proof that it is the authentic formula_61th element of the original vector that created the commitment formula_56. The proof does not require any values of formula_54 other than formula_64 to be revealed, and it is impossible to create valid proofs that reveal different values for any of the formula_64 than the true one.

===Vector hashing===

Vector hashing is a naive vector commitment partial reveal scheme based on bit-commitment. Values formula_66 are chosen randomly. Individual commitments are created by hashing formula_67. The overall commitment is computed as
:formula_68
In order to prove one element of the vector formula_54, the prover reveals the values
:formula_70
The verifier is able to compute formula_71 from formula_64 and formula_73, and then is able to verify that the hash of all formula_74 values is the commitment formula_56. 
Unfortunately the proof is formula_76 in size and verification time. Alternately, if formula_56 is the set of all formula_74 values, then the commitment is formula_76 in size, and the proof is formula_80 in size and verification time. Either way, the commitment or the proof scales with formula_76 which is not optimal.

===Merkle tree===
A common example of a practical partial reveal scheme is a Merkle tree, in which a binary hash tree is created of the elements of formula_54. This scheme creates commitments that are formula_80 in size, and proofs that are formula_84 in size and verification time. The root hash of the tree is the commitment formula_56. To prove that a revealed formula_64 is part of the original tree, only formula_87 hash values from the tree, one from each level, must be revealed as the proof. The verifier is able to follow the path from the claimed leaf node all the way up to the root, hashing in the sibling nodes at each level, and eventually arriving at a root node value that must equal formula_56.

===KZG commitment===
A Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg commitment uses pairing-based cryptography to build a partial reveal scheme with formula_80 commitment sizes, proof sizes, and proof verification time. In other words, as formula_90, the number of values in formula_54, increases, the commitments and proofs do not get larger, and the proofs do not take any more effort to verify.

A KZG commitment requires a predetermined set of parameters to create a pairing, and a trusted trapdoor element. For example, a Tate pairing can be used. Assume that formula_92 are the additive groups, and formula_93 is the multiplicative group of the pairing. In other words, the pairing is the map formula_94. Let formula_95 be the trapdoor element (if formula_24 is the prime order of formula_97 and formula_98), and let formula_99 and formula_100 be the generators of formula_97 and formula_98 respectively. As part of the parameter setup, we assume that formula_103 and formula_104 are known and shared values for arbitrarily many positive integer values of formula_61, while the trapdoor value formula_106 itself is discarded and known to no one.

====Commit====

A KZG commitment reformulates the vector of values to be committed as a polynomial. First, we calculate a polynomial such that formula_107 for all values of formula_64 in our vector. Lagrange interpolation allows us to compute that polynomial
:formula_109
Under this formulation, the polynomial now encodes the vector, where formula_110. Let formula_111 be the coefficients of formula_24, such that formula_113. The commitment is calculated as
:formula_114
This is computed simply as a dot product between the predetermined values formula_103 and the polynomial coefficients formula_116. Since formula_97 is an additive group with associativity and commutativity, formula_56 is equal to simply formula_119, since all the additions and multiplications with formula_99 can be distributed out of the evaluation. Since the trapdoor value formula_106 is unknown, the commitment formula_56 is essentially the polynomial evaluated at a number known to no one, with the outcome obfuscated into an opaque element of formula_97.

====Reveal====

A KZG proof must demonstrate that the revealed data is the authentic value of formula_64 when formula_56 was computed. Let formula_126, the revealed value we must prove. Since the vector of formula_64 was reformulated into a polynomial, we really need to prove that the polynomial formula_24, when evaluated at formula_61, takes on the value formula_74. Simply, we just need to prove that formula_131. We will do this by demonstrating that subtracting formula_74 from formula_24 yields a root at formula_61. Define the polynomial formula_25 as
:formula_136
This polynomial is itself the proof that formula_131, because if formula_25 exists, then formula_139 is divisible by formula_140, meaning it has a root at formula_61, so formula_142 (or, in other words, formula_131). The KZG proof will demonstrate that formula_25 exists and has this property.

The prover computes formula_25 through the above polynomial division, then calculates the KZG proof value formula_146
:formula_147
This is equal to formula_148, as above. In other words, the proof value is the polynomial formula_25 again evaluated at the trapdoor value formula_106, hidden in the generator formula_99 of formula_97.

This computation is only possible if the above polynomials were evenly divisible, because in that case the quotient formula_25 is a polynomial, not a rational function. Due to the construction of the trapdoor, it is not possible to evaluate a rational function at the trapdoor value, only to evaluate a polynomial using linear combinations of the precomputed known constants of formula_103. This is why it is impossible to create a proof for an incorrect value of formula_64.

====Verify====

To verify the proof, the bilinear map of the pairing is used to show that the proof value formula_146 summarizes a real polynomial formula_25 that demonstrates the desired property, which is that formula_139 was evenly divided by formula_140. The verification computation checks the equality
:formula_160
where formula_26 is the bilinear map function as above. formula_162 is a precomputed constant, formula_163 is computed based on formula_61.

By rewriting the computation in the pairing group formula_93, substituting in formula_166 and formula_167, and letting formula_168 be a helper function for lifting into the pairing group, the proof verification is more clear.

:formula_169
:formula_170
:formula_171
:formula_172
:formula_173

Assuming that the bilinear map is validly constructed, this demonstrates that formula_174, without the validator knowing what formula_24 or formula_25 are. The validator can be assured of this because if formula_173, then the polynomials evaluate to the same output at the trapdoor value formula_178. This demonstrates the polynomials are identical, because, if the parameters were validly constructed, the trapdoor value is known to no one, meaning that engineering a polynomial to have a specific value at the trapdoor is impossible (according to the Schwartz–Zippel lemma). If formula_174 is now verified to be true, then formula_25 is verified to exist, therefore formula_139 must be polynomial-divisible by formula_182, so formula_142 due to the factor theorem. This proves that the formula_61th value of the committed vector must have equaled formula_74, since that is the output of evaluating the committed polynomial at formula_61.

Additionally, a KZG commitment can be extended to prove the values of any arbitrary formula_187 values of formula_54 (not just one value), with the proof size remaining formula_80, but the proof verification time scales with formula_190. The proof is the same, but instead of subtracting a constant formula_74, we subtract a polynomial that causes multiple roots, at all the locations we want to prove, and instead of dividing by formula_140 we divide by formula_193 for those same locations.

==Quantum bit commitment==
It is an interesting question in quantum cryptography if &quot;unconditionally secure&quot; bit commitment protocols exist on the quantum level, that is, protocols which are (at least asymptotically) binding and concealing even if there are no restrictions on the computational resources. One could hope that there might be a way to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanics, as in the protocols for unconditionally secure key distribution.

However, this is impossible, as Dominic Mayers showed in 1996 (see for the original proof). Any such protocol can be reduced to a protocol where the system is in one of two pure states after the commitment phase, depending on the bit Alice wants to commit. If the protocol is unconditionally concealing, then Alice can unitarily transform these states into each other using the properties of the Schmidt decomposition, effectively defeating the binding property.

One subtle assumption of the proof is that the commit phase must be finished at some point in time. This leaves room for protocols that require a continuing information flow until the bit is unveiled or the protocol is cancelled, in which case it is not binding anymore. More generally, Mayers&#x27; proof applies only to protocols that exploit quantum physics but not special relativity. Kent has shown that there exist unconditionally secure protocols for bit commitment that exploit the principle of special relativity stating that information cannot travel faster than light.

==Commitments based on physical unclonable functions==
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) rely on the use of a physical key with internal randomness, which is hard to clone or to emulate. Electronic, optical and other types of PUFs have been discussed extensively in the literature, in connection with their potential cryptographic applications including commitment schemes.

<doc id="439493" wikidata="Q2927471" url="?curid=439493" title="Buckley v. Valeo">
<text>Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court on campaign finance. A majority of justices held that, as provided by section 608 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, limits on election expenditures are unconstitutional. In a &quot;per curiam&quot; (by the Court) opinion, they ruled that expenditure limits contravene the First Amendment provision on freedom of speech because a restriction on spending for political communication necessarily reduces the quantity of expression. It limited disclosure provisions and limited the Federal Election Commission&#x27;s power. Justice Byron White dissented in part and wrote that Congress had legitimately recognized unlimited election spending &quot;as a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken&quot;.

&quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; was extended by the U.S. Supreme Court in further cases, including in the five to four decision of &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; in 1978 and &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; in 2010. The latter held that corporations may spend from their general treasuries during elections. In 2014, &quot;McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission&quot; held that aggregate limits on political giving by an individual are unconstitutional.

By some measures, &quot;Buckley&quot; is the longest opinion ever issued by the Supreme Court.

==Facts==
Congress had made previous attempts to regulate campaign finance. It passed the Tillman Act of 1907, and then the Taft–Hartley Act in 1947. Neither was well enforced.

Then, in 1974, Congress passed significant amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), creating the most comprehensive effort by the federal government to date to regulate federal campaign contributions and spending. President Gerald Ford signed the bill into law on October 15. The key parts of the amended law did the following:
*limited contributions to candidates for federal office (2 USC §441a)
*required the disclosure of political contributions (2 USC §434),
*provided for the public financing of presidential elections (IRC Subtitle H),
*limited expenditures by candidates and associated committees,
*limited independent expenditures to $1,000 (formerly 18 U.S.C. §608e),
*limited candidate expenditures from personal funds (formerly 18 U.S.C. §608a),
*created and fixed the method of appointing members to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) (formerly 2 U.S.C. §437c(a) (1)(A–C)). Eight members of the commission were to be chosen as follows: the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives were &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Commission without a right to vote; two members would be appointed by the President &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Senate upon recommendations of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate; two would be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives upon recommendations of the majority and minority leaders of the House, and two would be appointed by the President. The six voting members would then need to be confirmed by the majority of both Houses of Congress. In addition, there was a requirement that each of the three appointing authorities was forbidden to choose both of their appointees from the same political party.

The lawsuit was filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, on January 2, 1975, by U.S. Senator James L. Buckley (a member of the Conservative Party of New York State), former U.S. Senator and 1968 presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy (a Democrat from Minnesota), the New York Civil Liberties Union, the American Conservative Union, the Peace &amp; Freedom Party, the Libertarian Party, and numerous other plaintiffs. The named defendant in the caption was Francis R. Valeo, the Secretary of the Senate, an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the FEC who represented the U.S. federal government. The trial court denied plaintiffs&#x27; request for declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Appeals and finally to the Supreme Court.

The plaintiffs argued that the legislation violated the 1st and 5th Amendment rights to freedom of expression and due process, respectively.

==Judgment==
In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court held that several key provisions of the Campaign Finance Act, § 608(a), which limited expenditure by political campaigns, are unconstitutional and contrary to the First Amendment. The major holdings were as follows:
* The Court upheld limits on contributions to candidates.
* The Court upheld limitations on volunteers&#x27; incidental expenses. 
* The Court upheld the aggregate limit on an individual&#x27;s total contributions to all candidates and committees in a calendar year. 
* The Court struck down limits on expenditures by candidates.
* The Court struck down limits on independent expenditures (i.e., expenditures by other groups or individuals than candidates and political parties).
* The Court upheld mandatory disclosure and reporting provisions, but it narrowed the types of speech to which they could apply.
* The Court upheld a system of voluntary government funding of campaigns, including limits on spending by candidates who choose to accept government subsidies.
* The Court struck down the system by which members of Congress directly appointed Federal Election Commission commissioners.
The Court&#x27;s opinion begins by stating certain &quot;General Principles&quot;, and then dealing with individual parts of the law in turn.

===General principles=== 
* First, the Court cited the importance of the First Amendment issues at stake: &quot;The Act&#x27;s contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities. Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution. The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order &#x27;to assure (the) unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.&#x27;&quot; The Court stated that these issues include &quot;political association as well as political expression.&quot;
* The Court rejected the idea that limits on campaign contributions and spending merely limited conduct: &quot;[T]his Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to ... reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment.&quot; The opinion cited &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, and it noted that sending a telegram to a public official—a clearly protected activity—costs money.
* Further, even if considered &quot;conduct&quot;, the Court found that &quot;it is beyond dispute that the interest in regulating the alleged &#x27;conduct&#x27; of giving or spending money &#x27;arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful.&#x27;&quot;
* The restrictions were not justified under the &quot;times, places, and manner&quot; clause giving the government the authority to regulate elections: The restrictions were &quot;direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by persons, groups, candidates, and political parties.&quot;
* The Court affirmed a First Amendment interest in spending money to facilitate campaign speech, writing, &quot;A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.&quot; Further, the law&#x27;s &quot;$1,000 ceiling on spending &#x27;relative to a clearly identified candidate,&#x27; would appear to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, political parties, and the institutional press from any significant use of the most effective modes of communication.&quot; (citations omitted). 
* However, &quot;limitation[s] upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor&#x27;s ability to engage in free communication&quot;, because such persons or groups are free to communicate directly with voters. Nevertheless, &quot;[g]iven the important role of contributions in financing political campaigns, contribution restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue if the limitations prevented candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.&quot;
* &quot;The Act&#x27;s contribution and expenditure limitations also impinge on protected associational freedoms. Making a contribution, like joining a political party, serves to affiliate a person with a candidate.&quot;
* Finally, the Court concluded this section by stating, &quot;In sum, although the Act&#x27;s contribution and expenditure limitations both implicate fundamental First Amendment interests, its expenditure ceilings impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than do its limitations on financial contributions.&quot;

===Contribution limits===
* The Court held that restrictions on &quot;large campaign contributions&quot; are justified by the state&#x27;s interest in &quot;the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates&#x27; positions and on their actions if elected to office.&quot; The Court further defined &quot;corruption&quot; to mean &quot;large contributions ... given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders.&quot;
* The Court rejected the plaintiffs&#x27; claim that all &quot;contribution limitations must be invalidated because bribery laws and narrowly drawn disclosure requirements constitute a less restrictive means of dealing with &#x27;proven and suspected quid pro quo arrangements.&#x27;&quot;
* Thus the Court upheld the limits on contributions to candidates and their campaign committees, and to parties and political action committees, in the Act.

===Expenditure limits===
* The Court first reiterated that &quot;[t]he Act&#x27;s expenditure ceilings impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech.&quot; It reviewed the sweeping scope of the law, noting, &quot;The plain effect of [the Act] is to prohibit all individuals, who are neither candidates nor owners of institutional press facilities, and all groups, except political parties and campaign organizations, from voicing their views &#x27;relative to a clearly identified candidate&#x27; through means that entail aggregate expenditures of more than $1,000 during a calendar year. The provision, for example, would make it a federal criminal offense for a person or association to place a single one-quarter page advertisement &#x27;relative to a clearly identified candidate&#x27; in a major metropolitan newspaper.&quot;
* The Court held that the &quot;key operative language of the provision ... [—]&quot;any expenditure ... relative to a clearly identified candidate&quot;—was unconstitutionally vague, for it &quot;fails to clearly mark the boundary between permissible and impermissible speech, unless other portions of [the Act] make sufficiently explicit the range of expenditures covered by the limitation. The section prohibits &#x27;any expenditure ... relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year which, when added to all other expenditures ... advocating the election or defeat of such candidate, exceeds, $1,000.&#x27; (Emphasis added.) This context clearly permits, if indeed it does not require, the phrase &quot;relative to&quot; a candidate to be read to mean &#x27;advocating the election or defeat of&#x27; a candidate.&quot; The Court elaborated in a footnote that &quot;[t]his construction would restrict the application of [the law] to communications containing express words of advocacy of election or defeat, such as &#x27;vote for,&#x27; &#x27;elect,&#x27; &#x27;support,&#x27; &#x27;cast your ballot for,&#x27; &#x27;Smith for Congress,&#x27; &#x27;vote against,&#x27; &#x27;defeat,&#x27; &#x27;reject.&#x27;&quot;
* Even after narrowing the scope of the provision, however, the Court found that limits on expenditures are unconstitutional. &quot;We find that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify s 608(e)(1)&#x27;s ceiling on independent expenditures... First, assuming, arguendo, that large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements as do large contributions, Sec. 608(e)(1) does not provide an answer that sufficiently relates to the elimination of those dangers. Unlike the contribution limitations&#x27; total ban on the giving of large amounts of money to candidates, Sec. 608(e)(1) prevents only some large expenditures. So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views. The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitation&#x27;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or office-holder.&quot;
* &quot;Second, quite apart from the shortcomings ... in preventing any abuses generated by large independent expenditures, the independent advocacy restricted by the provision does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions ... The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate. Rather than preventing circumvention of the contribution limitations, Sec. 608(e)(1) severely restricts all independent advocacy despite its substantially diminished potential for abuse.&quot;
* The Court rejected the notion that a &quot;governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections serves to justify the limitation on express advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates imposed by Sec. 608(e)(1)&#x27;s expenditure ceiling ... [T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed &#x27;to secure &quot;the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources,&quot;&#x27; and &#x27;&quot;to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.&quot;&#x27;&quot;
* Thus, the Court struck down limits on both candidate and independent spending as unconstitutional.

===Reporting and disclosure requirements===
* The Court recognized that reporting and disclosure requirements infringe on First Amendment rights. &quot;[W]e have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.&quot;
* However, the Court held that the government has a vital interest in &quot;provid[ing] the electorate with information &#x27;as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate&#x27; in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who seek federal office&quot;, a vital interest in allowing &quot;voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches.&quot; These interests are a result of the fact that &quot;the sources of a candidate&#x27;s financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office.&quot; Further, &quot;disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity.&quot; Finally, &quot;recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations described above.&quot;
* However, the Court again found the statute&#x27;s reach, as written, to be unconstitutionally overbroad. It thus ruled that the Act&#x27;s disclosure requirements apply to &quot;individuals and groups that are not candidates or political committees only in the following circumstances: (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent, to some person other than a candidate or political committee, and (2) when they make expenditures for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.&quot;

===Public funding of campaigns===
* The Court ruled that the government can directly subsidize political campaigns, but that it cannot require candidates to forego private fundraising if they choose the subsidy instead.
* The Court held that the government can condition receipt of the campaign subsidy on a candidate&#x27;s voluntary agreement to limit his or her total spending.

===Make-up of FEC===
* The Court held that the method for appointments to the Federal Election Commission was an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers. The Court opined that these powers could properly be exercised by an &quot;Officer of the United States&quot; (validly appointed under Article II, Section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution) but held that the Commissioners could not exercise this significant authority because they were not &quot;appointed&quot;. &quot;Id.&quot; at 137. Burger and Rehnquist agreed that limits on expenditure are unconstitutional, but dissented otherwise, stating that they would have held much larger parts of the Act to be unconstitutional.

==Dissents==

Although Justice Douglas took part in oral arguments, his resignation intervened and he cast no official vote in the case. Thus, eight justices decided the case. The opinion was a per curiam opinion, that is, not authored by a single justice, but an opinion for the Court. Several justices dissented from portions of the opinion.

Justice White would have upheld all the restrictions on both contributions and expenditures, striking down only the FEC&#x27;s appointment process. He said the following:

Concededly, neither the limitations on contributions nor those on expenditures directly or indirectly purport to control the content of political speech by candidates or by their supporters or detractors. What the Act regulates is giving and spending money, acts that have First Amendment significance not because they are themselves communicative with respect to the qualifications of the candidate, but because money may be used to defray the expenses of speaking or otherwise communicating about the merits or demerits of federal candidates for election. The act of giving money to political candidates, however, may have illegal or other undesirable consequences: it may be used to secure the express or tacit understanding that the giver will enjoy political favor if the candidate is elected. Both Congress and this Court&#x27;s cases have recognized this as a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken.

I also disagree with the Court&#x27;s judgment that § 608(a), which limits the amount of money that a candidate or his family may spend on his campaign, violates the Constitution. Although it is true that this provision does not promote any interest in preventing the corruption of candidates, the provision does, nevertheless, serve salutary purposes related to the integrity of federal campaigns. By limiting the importance of personal wealth, § 608(a) helps to assure that only individuals with a modicum of support from others will be viable candidates. This in turn would tend to discourage any notion that the outcome of elections is primarily a function of money. Similarly, § 608(a) tends to equalize access to the political arena, encouraging the less wealthy, unable to bankroll their own campaigns, to run for political office.

Since the contribution and expenditure limitations are neutral as to the content of speech and are not motivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech of particular candidates or of political speech in general, this case depends on whether the nonspeech interests of the Federal Government in regulating the use of money in political campaigns are sufficiently urgent to justify the incidental effects that the limitations visit upon the First Amendment interests of candidates and their supporters.

Justice Marshall dissented on the point of limiting personal contributions and expenditures by a candidate to his or her own campaign – he would have upheld that provision, which was stricken by the Court.

One of the points on which all Members of the Court agree is that money is essential for effective communication in a political campaign. It would appear to follow that the candidate with a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant &quot;headstart.&quot; Of course, the less wealthy candidate can potentially overcome the disparity in resources through contributions from others. But ability to generate contributions may itself depend upon a showing of a financial base for the campaign or some demonstration of preexisting support, which, in turn, is facilitated by expenditures of substantial personal sums. Thus, the wealthy candidate&#x27;s immediate access to a substantial personal fortune may give him an initial advantage that his less wealthy opponent can never overcome. And even if the advantage can be overcome, the perception that personal wealth wins elections may not only discourage potential candidates without significant personal wealth from entering the political arena, but also undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.

Justice Rehnquist dissented on the application of the public funding provisions to minor parties, believing that it was unconstitutional as applied to them.

Justice Blackmun would have held that contribution limits are unconstitutional.

Chief Justice Burger would have held that contribution limits are unconstitutional, that the government financing provisions are unconstitutional, and that disclosure of small contributions to campaigns is unconstitutional.

Justice Stevens arrived on the Court after argument so he did not participate in the decision. However, he said later that he &#x27;always thought that Byron [White] got it right&#x27;. Stevens would go on to write the dissent in Citizens United and called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Court&#x27;s campaign finance decisions.

<doc id="439497" wikidata="Q3090317" url="?curid=439497" title="Classical limit">
<text>The classical limit or correspondence limit is the ability of a physical theory to approximate or &quot;recover&quot; classical mechanics when considered over special values of its parameters. The classical limit is used with physical theories that predict non-classical behavior.

==Quantum theory==
A heuristic postulate called the correspondence principle was introduced to quantum theory by Niels Bohr: in effect it states that some kind of continuity argument should apply to the classical limit of quantum systems as the value of the Planck constant normalized by the action of these systems becomes very small. Often, this is approached through &quot;quasi-classical&quot; techniques (cf. WKB approximation).

More rigorously, the mathematical operation involved in classical limits is a group contraction, approximating physical systems where the relevant action is much larger than the reduced Planck constant , so the &quot;deformation parameter&quot; / can be effectively taken to be zero (cf. Weyl quantization.) Thus typically, quantum commutators (equivalently, Moyal brackets) reduce to Poisson brackets, in a group contraction.

In quantum mechanics, due to Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, an electron can never be at rest; it must always have a non-zero kinetic energy, a result not found in classical mechanics. For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it cannot really have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can effectively appear to be at rest, and hence it appears to obey classical mechanics. In general, if large energies and large objects (relative to the size and energy levels of an electron) are considered in quantum mechanics, the result will appear to obey classical mechanics. The typical occupation numbers involved are huge: a macroscopic harmonic oscillator with  = 2 Hz,  = 10 g, and maximum amplitude 0 = 10 cm, has  = , so that  ≃ 1030. Further see coherent states. It is less clear, however, how the classical limit applies to chaotic systems, a field known as quantum chaos.

Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are usually treated with entirely different formalisms: quantum theory using Hilbert space, and classical mechanics using a representation in phase space. One can bring the two into a common mathematical framework in various ways. In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, which is statistical in nature, logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are made, enabling natural comparisons between them, including the violations of Liouville&#x27;s theorem (Hamiltonian) upon quantization.

In a crucial paper (1933), Dirac explained how classical mechanics is an emergent phenomenon of quantum mechanics: destructive interference among paths with non-extremal macroscopic actions  »  obliterate amplitude contributions in the path integral he introduced, leaving the extremal action class, thus the classical action path as the dominant contribution, an observation further elaborated by Feynman in his 1942 PhD dissertation. (Further see quantum decoherence.)

==Time-evolution of expectation values==

One simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the &quot;expected&quot; position and &quot;expected&quot; momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the Ehrenfest theorem. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential formula_1, the Ehrenfest theorem says
:formula_2
Although the first of these equations is consistent with the classical mechanics, the second is not: If the pair formula_3 were to satisfy Newton&#x27;s second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have read
:formula_4.
But in most cases,
:formula_5.
If for example, the potential formula_1 is cubic, then formula_7 is quadratic, in which case, we are talking about the distinction between formula_8 and formula_9, which differ by formula_10.

An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when formula_1 is quadratic and formula_7 is linear. In that special case, formula_13 and formula_14 do agree. In particular, for a free particle or a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum exactly follows solutions of Newton&#x27;s equations.

For general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will &quot;approximately&quot; follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point formula_15, then formula_13 and formula_14 will be &quot;almost&quot; the same, since both will be approximately equal to formula_18. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least &quot;for as long as&quot; the wave function remains highly localized in position.

Now, if the initial state is very localized in position, it will be very spread out in momentum, and thus we expect that the wave function will rapidly spread out, and the connection with the classical trajectories will be lost. When the Planck constant is small, however, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in &quot;both&quot; position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle &quot;remains&quot; well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories for a long time.

==Relativity and other deformations==
Other familiar deformations in physics involve:

*The deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics (special relativity), with deformation parameter ; the classical limit involves small speeds, so , and the systems appear to obey Newtonian mechanics. 
*Similarly for the deformation of Newtonian gravity into general relativity, with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension, we find that objects once again appear to obey classical mechanics (flat space), when the mass of an object times the square of the Planck length is much smaller than its size and the sizes of the problem addressed. See Newtonian limit.
*Wave optics might also be regarded as a deformation of ray optics for deformation parameter .
*Likewise, thermodynamics deforms to statistical mechanics with deformation parameter .

<doc id="439501" wikidata="Q214704" url="?curid=439501" title="Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland">
<text>Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, Duke of Värmland (Carl Philip Edmund Bertil; born 13 May 1979) is the only son and the second of three children of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. , Prince Carl Philip is fourth in the line of succession, after his older sister, Crown Princess Victoria, his niece and goddaughter Princess Estelle, and his nephew Prince Oscar. He lives with his wife, Princess Sofia, and four children in Villa Solbacken in Djurgården, Stockholm.

== Early life and education ==
Prince Carl Philip was born at Stockholm Palace, Sweden, on 13 May 1979 at 07:20 (CET). He was baptised at the Royal Chapel on 31 August 1979. His mother is of half German and half Brazilian descent.

Carl Philip was heir apparent to the throne of Sweden (and thus held the title Crown Prince) for seven months, until 1 January 1980 when a change in the constitution came into effect which made natural birth order the basis for succession to the throne, replacing the principle of agnatic primogeniture. His elder sister Victoria became heir apparent and Crown Princess, with Carl Philip becoming second in line.

During 1984–1986, Prince Carl Philip attended the Västerled parish preschool. In the autumn of 1986, he started school at Smedslättsskolan in Bromma which he attended at junior level. For the intermediate level, he attended Ålstensskolan in Bromma, proceeding from there, in the autumn of 1992, to senior level at Enskilda Gymnasiet in Stockholm. In the autumn of 1994, Carl Philip enrolled at Kent School. He then continued his studies in a science programme at Lundsbergs upper secondary school. He graduated in the spring of 1999. In 2007–2008, he studied graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design for one year. In 2011, Prince Carl Philip finished his studies in Agricultural and Rural Management at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Alnarp.

Carl Philip has dyslexia, as do his father King Carl XVI Gustaf and his sister Crown Princess Victoria.

==Interests==
Prince Carl Philip has been a scout and is fond of outdoor life. He is keen on sport and athletics, especially football, swimming, sailing and skiing. In 2003, he completed the historic Swedish &quot;Vasaloppet&quot;, the longest cross country ski race in the world. Carl Philip also enjoys car racing, a passion he inherited from his great-uncle and godfather, Prince Bertil, and has a licence to compete. Prince Carl Philip has taken part in the racing series Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia in a Porsche 911 GT3. Since 2013 he has raced in the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship.

The prince completed his military service at the Amphibious Battalion at Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment as a combat boat commander (Combat Boat 90) in the autumn of 2000. In December 2002, the Prince was promoted to second lieutenant, and in 2004 to the rank of lieutenant in the Swedish Amphibious Corps. In 2007 and 2008 he went to the Swedish Defence University. The course was divided in three weeks autumn 2007 and three weeks spring 2008. After that course he was appointed captain. On 1 October 2014, Prince Carl Philip achieved the rank of major.

With a great interest for design and drawing, the prince began studying graphic design in Stockholm in 2003, studies which he continues still. In 2012 he founded Bernadotte &amp; Kylberg with Oscar Kylberg. The company has since designed products for many brands.

== Activities and charity work ==
Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia&#x27;s Foundation was established to mark the occasion of the couple&#x27;s marriage in 2015. The foundation&#x27;s purpose is to counteract bullying.

In 2013, the Prince Carl Philip Racing Cup was founded. The racing cup aims to help young people with karting talents progress within the sport. The Prince with the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences conducts a range of visits to companies, with focus on the companies&#x27; creative work.

Prince Carl Philip is a patron of several organizations such as The Swedish National Dyslexia Association, The Swedish Rural Economy and Agricultural Societies, The International Union for Conservation of Nature, The Royal Swedish Motorboat Club and others.

==Personal life and family==
Prince Carl Philip dated Emma Pernald from 1999 to 2009. Pernald worked at a PR firm for several years. However, the prince and Pernald broke off their relationship in March 2009. She revealed in the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; that she and the prince mutually decided to go their separate ways. Pernald made no further comment as to the reason for the break-up.

In April 2010, Carl Philip was linked in the press with former glamour model Sofia Hellqvist. In August 2010, Royal Court spokesperson Nina Eldh confirmed the relationship between Carl Philip and Hellqvist in a statement released by the palace. On 27 June 2014, it was announced that Carl Philip and Hellqvist were engaged.

They married on 13 June 2015 in Stockholm&#x27;s Royal Palace chapel, and thousands of people lined the streets for the occasion. In an interview he criticized the press for suggesting that Hellqvist was not welcome in the royal family. He told the press that the opposite was true and that his family easily accepted her into the family. He compared the &quot;bullying&quot; of her past to that of himself being bullied for having dyslexia.

The couple was due to move into the Villa Solbacken which had been vacant since the death of Princess Lilian and, while it was being renovated, they lived in Rosendal Palace until 2017.

Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia have four children:

*Prince Alexander Erik Hubertus Bertil, Duke of Södermanland, born on 19 April 2016. 
*Prince Gabriel Carl Walther, Duke of Dalarna, born on 31 August 2017. 
*Prince Julian Herbert Folke, Duke of Halland, born on 26 March 2021. 
*Princess Ines Marie Lilian Silvia, Duchess of Västerbotten, born on 7 February 2025.

All four children were born at Danderyd Hospital.

On 7 October 2019, Carl Philip&#x27;s father, the king, issued a statement rescinding the royal status of Prince Alexander and Prince Gabriel in an effort to more strictly associate Swedish royalty to the office of the head of state; they are still to be styled as princes and dukes of their provinces, and they remain in the line of succession to the throne. Carl Philip and his wife commented that their sons now will have more freedom of choice for their future lives.

<text>Air Hong Kong (stylised as air Hongkong) is an all-cargo airline based in Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong, with its main hub at Hong Kong International Airport. The airline operates an express freight network to 13 destinations in nine countries, including China, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. It has a fleet of Airbus A300-600F General Freighters, which the airline was the launch customer of. Its head office is located on the fourth floor of the South Tower of Cathay Pacific City.

Air Hong Kong was founded in November 1986 by three local businessmen and commenced charter services with a Boeing 707-320C freighter on 4 February 1988. In June 1994, Hong Kong&#x27;s largest carrier, Cathay Pacific acquired 75% holdings of the airline; and acquired the remaining 25% in February 2002. In October, Cathay Pacific entered into a joint venture with DHL Worldwide Express (DHL), that eventually saw DHL take a 40% stake in the cargo airline, while Cathay Pacific retained the other 60% holding.

In 2017, Cathay Pacific entered into an agreement with DHL International for Cathay Pacific to acquire from DHL International the 40% shareholding in Air Hong Kong that it did not already own. This agreement was completed at the end of 2018, with the result that Air Hong Kong is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific. Air Hong Kong continues to operate an agreed freighter network to destinations in Asia for DHL International.

== History ==

Air Hong Kong was established in November 1986 by three local businessmen from London&#x27;s Stansted Airport, which included Roger Walman. Roger teamed up with Tomas Sang from Hong Kong to help fund the business. The airline commenced charter services with a Boeing 707-320C freighter on 4 February 1988, to Bombay (now known as Mumbai), Britain and Kathmandu; and scheduled services began on 18 October 1989. By early 1990, the airline had two Boeing 707-320C and operated a scheduled cargo service to Manchester, with traffic rights to Auckland, Brussels, Fukuoka, Guam, Melbourne, Nagoya, Osaka, Perth, Busan, Singapore, Sydney, Vienna and Zürich. Schedule cargo service to Nagoya was introduced and new traffic rights to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City granted by April 1991. In March 1992, Air Hong Kong was granted additional traffic rights to Cairns, Darwin, Dhaka, Dubai, Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur and Townsville. By March 1993, the airline operated scheduled cargo services to Brussels, Dubai, Ho Chi Minh City, Manchester, Nagoya and Singapore with a fleet of two Boeing 747-100SF and one Boeing 707-320C freighters.

Polaris Aircraft Leasing, a subsidiary of General Electric Capital, entered into agreement in 1993 to suspend lease payments on the airline&#x27;s three Boeing 747-100SFs in return for an option to buy up to 49 percent of the airline in January 1995. However, Cathay Pacific acquired 75 percent of the airline&#x27;s shares for HK$200 million in June 1994 and the option was cancelled. Facing weak demands and heavy financial losses, the airline was forced to terminate the lease on its Boeing 707-320C and one of its Boeing 747-100SF in November 1994 and January 1995, respectively, with only two Boeing 747-100SFs remaining. By 2000, the airline had a fleet of three Boeing 747-200Fs with scheduled cargo services to Brussels, Dubai, Manchester and Osaka.

The airline&#x27;s parent, Cathay Pacific, acquired the remaining 25 percent of the airline&#x27;s shares in February 2002 and became a wholly owned subsidiary. An operational restructure followed on 1 July, where Air Hong Kong ceased services to Brussels, Dubai and Manchester to focus on services in Asia. In October 2002, Cathay Pacific entered into a joint venture agreement with DHL Worldwide Express (DHL) by selling a 30 percent stake in the cargo airline in exchange for funds to purchase medium-size freighters to operate DHL&#x27;s network in the Asia-Pacific region from Hong Kong. The airline set aside $300 million to purchase five freighters by 2004 and another $100 million towards at least three more freighters by 2010. In March 2003, Cathay Pacific sold another 10 percent stake to DHL and retained 60 percent of the airline.

Air Hong Kong was the launch customer for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, which is a new variant of the Airbus A300-600F. This new variant has a cargo loading system capable of handling virtually every type of container and pallet, and a side door at the rear of the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.

In November 2007, Air Hong Kong received an Award for Operational Excellence by the aircraft manufacturer Airbus for achieving an overall best performance on aircraft utilisation, operational reliability and average delay time.

== Destinations ==
Air Hong Kong operates cargo flights to the following destinations :

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
Air Hong Kong operates the following all-Airbus freighter fleet:

In 2020, Air Hong Kong transferred a second A330F to its own air operator&#x27;s certificate. While the first was a freighter-converted A330-322F, the latest is a production A330-243F. ASL Airlines is currently operating one converted A330-322F for Air Hong Kong, while another aircraft an A330-343F, is being converted at EFW in Dresden. It is unknown when the fourth aircraft will be introduced into the network or when the current aircraft (being operated by ASL Airlines) will transfer under Air Hong Kong&#x27;s AOC. The program is currently behind schedule.

The airline was the launch customer for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, which was the new variant of the Airbus A300-600F.

<doc id="439508" wikidata="Q212035" url="?curid=439508" title="Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland">
<text>Princess Madeleine of Sweden, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland (Madeleine Thérèse Amelie Josephine; born 10 June 1982) is the second daughter and youngest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. Upon her birth, she was third in line of succession to the Swedish throne; currently, she is ninth. Princess Madeleine is married to British-American financier Christopher O&#x27;Neill. They have three children, Princess Leonore, Prince Nicolas and Princess Adrienne.

==Early life==
Madeleine was born on 10 June 1982 at 19:05 CEST at Drottningholm Palace and is a member of the Swedish royal family from the House of Bernadotte. She was christened at The Royal Palace Church on 31 August 1982, her godparents being her father&#x27;s maternal cousin the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, her maternal uncle Walther L. Sommerlath, her father&#x27;s paternal cousin Princess Benedikte of Denmark, and her paternal aunt Princess Christina, Mrs Magnuson. Madeleine was given the honorary title of Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland. It was the first time since the early 17th century (when such titles were still more than honorary) that a Swedish ducal title included more than one province. Both Hälsingland and Gästrikland are encompassed by Gävleborg County.

==Education==
From 1985 to 1989, Madeleine began her education at Västerled Parish Pre-School. In the autumn of 1989, she entered Smedslättsskolan in Bromma, attending at the junior level. For the intermediate level, she proceeded to Carlssons School in Stockholm, and then went on to Enskilda Gymnasiet in Stockholm, which she attended at the senior level. She also completed upper secondary school at Enskilda, from which she graduated in 2001. During the autumn of 2001, she lived in London, where she studied English. In the spring of 2002, she took a basic module in Introduction to Swedish Law and studied for the European Computer Driving Licence. In January 2003, she enrolled at the Stockholm University where she began studies in art history. She took 60 Swedish academic units in this subject (two semesters). In the autumn of 2004, she began a course in ethnology at the same university. She speaks English, German and Swedish fluently, and also intermediate-level French. She graduated 23 January 2006 with a Bachelor of Arts in art history, ethnology and modern history. During 2007, she studied child psychology at University of Stockholm.

==Leisure pursuits==
Madeleine is an enthusiastic equestrian. She has owned horses (which were stabled at the Royal Stables) and competed in showjumping under the name &quot;Anna Svensson&quot;. She also enjoys skiing, and is interested in theatre, dance and art. In recognition of her age of majority in 2001, a scholarship fund was created in her name by the Gävleborg province, which comprises her duchies of Hälsingland and Gästrikland. It encourages and supports young people involved in horse riding. In 2001, Madeleine first distributed such awards as &#x27;Pony Rider of the Year with trainer in Gävleborg&#x27; and &#x27;Gold Rider&#x27;.

==Activities==
Madeleine undertakes various engagements on behalf of her father and the people of Sweden. She participates in the celebrations of Sweden&#x27;s National Day, the Nobel festivities, dinners and state visits with other members of the royal family. She represented Sweden at the opening of the &quot;New Sweden Gallery&quot; on 5 June 2011, at the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which features an animated map of the New Sweden settlement by Sean Moir.

From 25 October to 1 November 2024 Madeleine temporarily acted as Regent Ad Interim. This is because her father the King was traveling to Brazil together with Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Carl Philip, leaving Madeleine as the closest in line to the throne remaining in Sweden.

===Charity work===
==== Patronages and interests ====
Madeleine is the patron of the organisation &quot;Min Stora Dag&quot; (the Swedish equivalent of Make-A-Wish Foundation), more commonly known as &quot;My Big Day&quot; (its translation into English). She is also affiliated with Europa Nostra, Carl Johan-League and the Royal Motorboat Club.

==== Victims of child exploitation ====
In 2006, Princess Madeleine interned for UNICEF for six months in New York City and worked for the division of Child Protective Services. In 2012, she co-founded the ThankYou by Childhood campaign which works to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the sexual abuse of children and the work the World Childhood Foundation does to prevent it. Princess Madeleine became involved in the work of the World Childhood Foundation during her studies. She became one of the juries of the Childhood Prize. She serves on the board of Swedish branch and is an honorary member of the board of the American branch of the World Childhood Foundation since 2016. She became the vice honorary chair of the World Childhood Foundation in December 2021. Her first visit as a vice honorary chair was in July 2022 when the Princess visited Frankfurt, Germany. There, she visited the German branch of the World Childhood Foundation, construction of Child House and met a former child sexual abuse victim. She also visited Frankfurt University Hospital and toured the hospital&#x27;s children department to meet with doctors to learn about their work.

In 2015, the Princess initiated the #EyesWideOpen campaign. It aims to increase the awareness about the sexual abuse of children. In conjunction with a high-level meeting in New York in the autumn of 2016, the Princess presented the continuation of the campaign – an app that makes it easier for adults to prevent, recognise and react to sexual abuse and exploitation of children. The app is a collaboration between the World Childhood Foundation, Darkness to Light and Ericsson. In February 2017, the Princess announced she was writing a children&#x27;s book during a visit to London&#x27;s Southbank Centre. On 28 January 2019, the Princess shared the book&#x27;s title and cover via Instagram. She wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m very excited to finally share with you a book which will hopefully show children how important it is to stand up for themselves and to tell someone when something doesn&#x27;t feel right.&quot; The book titled &quot;Stella och hemligheten&quot; (English: Stella and the Secret) was published in support of the World Childhood Foundation and was released on 4 June 2019.

==Personal life==

===First engagement===

Madeleine announced her engagement to lawyer Jonas Bergström (b. 1979) in August 2009. She said in her engagement interview that they became engaged in Capri in early June that year. An engagement dinner took place on the engagement day in Solliden Palace on Öland. The engagement could only take place after Bergström had been awarded the official approval of the Swedish Cabinet &quot;Regeringen&quot; and that had been communicated to her father, the King.

The wedding was originally due to take place in the second half of 2010 but was postponed due to &quot;many things happening in an intense period of time&quot;, mainly her sister Victoria&#x27;s wedding in June. Queen Silvia denied the rumoured relationship issues. However, media reporting of the relationship issues escalated, and on 24 April 2010 it was announced that the wedding would not go ahead, and the engagement was broken off.

After her relationship with Bergström ended, Madeleine moved to New York City, where she worked for the World Childhood Foundation, the organisation that her mother co-founded.

=== Marriage and children ===
On 25 October 2012, the Swedish Royal Court announced Princess Madeleine&#x27;s engagement with the British-born American financier Christopher O&#x27;Neill. On 23 December 2012, it was announced that the wedding would take place on 8 June 2013, at the Royal Palace chapel in Stockholm. O&#x27;Neill chose to remain untitled: a member of the Swedish royal family must hold Swedish citizenship which O&#x27;Neill declined.

The couple has three children:

* Princess Leonore Lilian Maria, Duchess of Gotland, born on 20 February 2014 at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City.
* Prince Nicolas Paul Gustaf, Duke of Ångermanland, born on 15 June 2015 at Danderyds sjukhus in Danderyd Municipality, Stockholm.
* Princess Adrienne Josephine Alice, Duchess of Blekinge, born on 9 March 2018 at Danderyds sjukhus in Danderyd Municipality, Stockholm. She was baptised at Drottningholm Palace Chapel on 8 June 2018.

In February 2015, the Swedish Royal Court announced that the family had moved to Stockholm from New York. In May 2015, the Swedish Royal Court announced that O&#x27;Neill had moved to London in April. In Autumn 2015, several months after the birth of Prince Nicolas, the entire family moved to London, where O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s business is located. In August 2018, the Swedish Royal Court announced that the princess and her family would move to Florida. In March 2023, it was announced that the family would move back to Sweden in August 2023. In June 2023, it was announced that the move has been postponed until 2024.

On 7 October 2019, the king issued a statement rescinding the royal status of her three children in an effort to more strictly associate Swedish royalty to the office of the head of state; they are no longer styled as His/Her Royal Highness (HRH), but their princely titles remain and they are still duchesses and duke of their provinces, remaining in the line of succession to the throne. Madeleine commented that her children now will have greater possibilities to shape their own lives as private individuals.

<doc id="439520" wikidata="Q17008852" url="?curid=439520" title="Living Church of God">
<text>The Living Church of God (LCG) is one of several groups that formed after the death of Herbert W. Armstrong, when major doctrinal changes (causing turmoil and divisions) were occurring in the former Worldwide Church of God (WCG) during the 1990s. It was after its founder, the late Roderick C. Meredith, was fired by board members of the Global Church of God (GCG), that he went on to found, for a second time, a new organization in 1998. It is just one of many and varied Sabbatarian Churches of God groups that have sprung up from the former Worldwide Church of God, known today as Grace Communion International (GCI). The US membership of the LCG is claimed to be around 11,300 with about 5,000 of that total number being claimed international members. From the LCG organization, several additional split-off groups have resulted over the years, each one headed by a former LCG minister.

==Founder==
The LCG&#x27;s founder and Presiding Evangelist was, until his death, Roderick C. Meredith (June 21, 1930 – May 18, 2017).

Following Meredith&#x27;s graduation from Ambassador College in Pasadena, California in June 1952, he was assigned by Herbert W. Armstrong (Pastor General of the Worldwide Church of God) to set up and pastor WCG congregations in Portland, Oregon; San Diego, California; and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. On December 20, 1952, after summoning him back to the WCG&#x27;s headquarters in Pasadena, California, from his pastorship in Oregon, Armstrong ordained him and four other men — including his uncle Dr. C. Paul Meredith — to the position of Evangelist. These men were the very first Evangelists of the WCG. Meredith was the youngest of the newly ordained men and the fifth to be ordained.

In the subsequent years, Meredith would help start scores of WCG congregations throughout the United States. He would also conduct many baptizing and evangelizing tours in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Africa. From the early to mid-1950s, and again in 1960, he was assigned by Armstrong to live in Britain to form congregations for the Church there. For years he was one of the WCG&#x27;s leading theologians and top executives, and an instructor at Ambassador College. However, when overseeing the ministry during the 1960s, he began to gain a reputation for being too strict in his application of Church rules and regulations.

==LCG&#x27;s Presiding Evangelist==

Due to declining health, in 2016 (aged 86), Meredith appointed Evangelist Gerald E. Weston as his successor and as President of the LCG. Weston has served congregations throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. He has been a frequent writer for the Church&#x27;s publications, and has trained many ministers over the years. He has been a long time member of the Church&#x27;s Council of Elders. Upon Meredith&#x27;s death in May 2017, Weston became the LCG&#x27;s Presiding Evangelist.

==Formation==
After Armstrong died, the WCG began to change many of its core doctrines; a process that brought the organization into the mainstream of Evangelical Christianity. However, many members objected and hundreds of splinter groups arose as a result.

Meredith initially founded the Global Church of God (GCG) in December 1992, but due to disagreements in operation strategy the board fired Meredith from his positions as chairman of the board and Presiding Evangelist in 1998. He then formed the LCG, incorporating the church in San Diego, California, in December 1998. His dismissal was unpopular with GCG members, with as much as 80 percent of the GCG membership following Meredith to the newly formed LCG. In 2004, the late Evangelist Raymond F. McNair (ordained by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1953, a year after Meredith&#x27;s ordination) left the LCG to start the Church of God 21st Century, which disbanded after his death in 2008. In 2005, ministers Don Haney and Ben Faulkner also left. Haney formed the Church of God In Peace and Truth, and Faulkner formed the Church of the Sovereign God. In 2006, Charles Bryce (whom Meredith had appointed head of Church administration) left and formed the Enduring Church of God. In late 2012, member Bob Thiel left and formed the Continuing Church of God. In 2013, minister Rod Reynolds left and formed the COG Messenger. In September 2020, minister Sheldon Monson formed the Church of God Assembly after he resigned.

In 2003, the church&#x27;s corporate headquarters were moved from San Diego to Charlotte, North Carolina. The church reported in 2011 that it had 330 congregations in 45 countries, and that over 8,000 members attended its annual eight-day festival of the Feast of Tabernacles and Last Great Day, at 46 sites in 31 countries on every continent (except Antarctica). An independent auditor specializing in non-profits reported that the church&#x27;s income for 2010 was over US$14.3 million. The LCG&#x27;s revenue comes from tithes, holy day offerings, and other contributions from both members and non-members. The tithe is 10% of a member&#x27;s income and it is permitted to tithe on the net income. The members should not tithe on &quot;unearned income&quot; (such as Social Security, old-age assistance, unemployment benefits, pensions, gifts, disability, or similar types of income).

==Doctrines==
The LCG believes that the Bible is God&#x27;s inspired revelation to mankind, and as such is complete and inerrant in its original form. The Church has a three-fold mission: 1. To preach the true Gospel of the Kingdom of God (Mark 1:14; Matthew 24:14; Ezekiel 3 and 33), and the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 8:12) to all nations as a witness. 2. To feed the flock and to organize local Church congregations to provide for the spiritual and material needs of our members as God makes it possible (1 Peter 5:1-4; John 21:15-18). 3. To preach the end-time prophecies and to warn the English-speaking nations and all the world of the coming Great Tribulation (Matthew 24:21).

Other beliefs include:
*Binitarianism: The belief that there are two divine Persons in the Godhead rather than the three in Christianity&#x27;s more common Trinitarianism. These two co-equal and co-eternal Persons are God the Father and God the Son (also called The Word). The Holy Spirit is not a Person, but is considered the very essence, the mind, life, breath, and power of God. Much in the same way the physical world is made of matter, the spiritual world is made of Spirit.
*Non-partisanism: Generally, members should not take part in politics, juries, voting, swearing oaths (members can only &quot;affirm&quot;, not swear, in court), or military service.
*British Israelism: The belief that the Anglo-American people are descended from the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, specifically Ephraim and Manasseh and are the possessors of the birthright promises and accompanying blessings of Abraham&#x27;s descendants, through his grandson Jacob. Other countries believed to be Israelite are Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Denmark.
*Many laws revealed in the Hebrew Scriptures should still be adhered to by Christians today, including clean and unclean animals, mentioned in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14:3–21, delineating which animals may be eaten. This was also a practice of the first-century Church (see Acts 10:14)
*Christians should observe the biblical seventh-day Sabbath. According to the biblical definition, a day is measured from sunset to sunset, and therefore the Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday, and ends at sunset on Saturday. No business is to be conducted or paid physical labor performed during this time period, nor any personal activities that take away from worship and family time. These include entertainment, such as participating in sporting events (for example, high school football), going to the movies, theater, dance hall, or bar, and watching non-religious movies or television, except news. Feeding livestock and cooking for family members are allowed. The Sabbath is viewed as holy, and set apart by God at creation (Genesis 2:2–3), and is a sign between God and his believers (Exodus 31:13).
*Annual festivals listed in Leviticus 23 and Deuteronomy 16 should be observed by Christians today as they were kept by Jesus, the original apostles, and the first-century Church of God, headquartered at Jerusalem. Members do not celebrate Christmas, Easter, saints&#x27; days, Lent, or other traditional Catholic or Christian holy days that were adopted by the Catholic Church (and some Protestant denominations) later in history. Regarding birthday celebrations, while many members do not participate in large birthday parties, a family meal or a day out is often substituted to celebrate and give thanks for another year of life. The new year is very much under some discussion as to where it falls, some believe it to fall in the fall, and some believe it to be in the spring. No official stance is given.

==Media projects==
Shortly after the LCG&#x27;s incorporation, it started producing a weekly, half-hour television program: &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. It is carried on 211 television stations throughout the world. In May 2006, the LCG&#x27;s media department reported that the show was accessible to nearly 78 million American households, or 71 percent of the American television market.

According to reports in March 2007 by Nielsen Research, the program was estimated to reach an average of 50,000 new viewers each week. From 1999 to date, approximately 320 programs have been taped and televised.

The LCG also publishes a free, bi-monthly, subscription magazine titled&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World.&quot; Circulation figures (July 2017), were 282,000 issues. From the magazine&#x27;s inception in 1999 through to May 2007, 8.3 million copies were produced. Additionally, the church operates a &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; website.

The church produces several foreign-language radio programs, which are broadcast on 15 stations. These include a Spanish program titled &quot;El Mundo de Mañana&quot; (&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;), presented by Mario Hernández, who also presents the Spanish telecast with the same title. Also, the French program &quot;Le Monde Demain&quot; (&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;) is broadcast throughout the Caribbean. It was presented by longtime evangelist and radio presenter Dibar K. Apartian until his death in 2010.

==Former online college==
On February 27, 2007, the LCG launched Living University, a nonprofit, online (distance-learning) institution. The LCG explored accreditation for Living University&#x27;s undergraduate degrees, diplomas, and certificates, but Living University was never accredited by any agency recognized by the United States Department of Education. More and more states were blocking non-accredited colleges and universities from offering classes within their borders, so it was decided to close Living University. Living University closed on May 14, 2018, after final commencement exercises for 30 students present. In August 2018, the LCG introduced a new program &quot;Living Education&quot;.

==Mass shooting by Terry Ratzmann==
On March 12, 2005, the LCG was thrust into national and international spotlight when member Terry Ratzmann (aged 44) shot at his brethren congregated for church services at the Sheraton Hotel in Brookfield, Wisconsin. It was one of the worst mass shootings in the state&#x27;s history. Ratzmann killed eight, including his pastor, his pastor&#x27;s son, and himself. No conclusive motive for the mass murder was reached, though police investigated religious issues as potential motives for the shooting 

==Suicide of minister Beyersdorfer==
&quot;A popular elder and former pastor of the Living Church of God, Karl Beyersdorfer, 73, took his own life May 27, 2016, at his home in Joplin, Mo.&quot; He committed suicide just days before his fiftieth wedding anniversary. Depression is thought to have been a factor. A 1966 graduate of Ambassador College, Karl had been an ordained minister for 49 years ministering in the Worldwide Church of God, and then joined Meredith in Global, and then followed him again to the LCG (1998).

<doc id="439523" wikidata="Q3178443" url="?curid=439523" title="California towhee">
<text>The California towhee (Melozone crissalis) is a bird of the family Passerellidae, native to the coastal regions of western Oregon and California in the United States and Baja California  and Baja California Sur in Mexico.

The taxonomy of this species has been debated. At the higher level, some authors place the towhees in the family Fringillidae. Within the group, there has been debate about whether the distinction between this species and the similar canyon towhee (&quot;Melozone fuscus&quot;) should be at the specific or subspecific level. The two species used to be grouped together as the brown towhee, yet today they are identified separately, especially because of their differing feather coloration, and the canyon towhee&#x27;s dark central breast spot. The two populations are quite isolated from each other, and molecular genetics seems to have settled the matter in favour of two distinct species for the present. On the other hand, there seems to be little distinction between the northern and Baja Californian populations within &quot;M. crissalis&quot;. Nowadays, scientists consider the Abert&#x27;s towhee as the California towhee&#x27;s closest relative due to closely aligned DNA and patterns.

== Taxonomy ==
Some authorities use &quot;Pipilo crissalis&quot; or &quot;Pyrgisoma crissale&quot; to refer to the California towhee, although the most widely regarded classification is &quot;Melozone crissalis.&quot; The difference arises between the distinct classifications the bird has due to its close proximity to other Passerellidae.

== Etymology ==
The classification of this bird follows the quinarian system popularized in the early 19th century to better identify birds. The term &quot;Melozone crissalis&quot; was developed by Nicholas Vigors in 1839, an Irish politician and zoologist who popularized the quinarian system around the world.

==Appearance==
The California towhee&#x27;s coloring is dull brown overall with light rust undertail covert feathers and buff or rust-colored streaks at the throat. There is little sexual dimorphism.

California towhees have the short, rounded wings of a sparrow, as well as a long tail and thick beak which is used for cracking seeds. However, the towhees are larger and bulkier than sparrows. Both sexes of towhee generally grow to be in length, with a wingspan of about . They weigh . The California towhee&#x27;s color pattern is matte brown all around, barring a rusty patch beneath its tail and around its bill. This is true of both females and males.

It is around in length, and has a noticeably long tail of . Its appearance suggests a large, plain sparrow. Males weigh from , with an average of , while females weigh from , with an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is .

== Distribution and habitat ==
This bird&#x27;s natural habitat is California&#x27;s brush, chaparral, open woodlands, and along streams adjacent to desert slopes. It has widely adapted to parks and gardens and is found throughout Baja California, as well. They can be found along the North Pacific coastline from Southern Oregon, USA to Baja California, Mexico. The California towhee is a non-migratory bird and they only change their homes when finding a mate.

As these birds are of Least Concern in their natural habitats, they do not face any imminent threats to their livelihood. According to the National Audubon Society, the three biggest threats to the California towhee are fire weather, spring heat waves, and urbanization. Fire weather may affect this towhee because they tend to hide in shrubbery. If these birds are found in a very densely forested area during a wildfire, they would definitely be under threat, but due to their reproductive patterns, their general population would remain largely unaffected. Spring heat waves affect populations by increasing the temperature, decreasing the supply of water and other resources, and can affect food chains. This would affect the California towhee, but once again, not enough for the entire population to move into the Not Threatened bracket. Urbanization may seem like the greatest threat to all species, however, this bird species has adapted well to living among and near people.

Currently, the California towhee&#x27;s range will not decrease or increase, however, if global warming continues at the same or a more rapid pace, their range and population may be greatly reduced. If the temperature of their range increases between during the summertime, they would gain at least a 2% range in available habitat, yet that still means they would have to migrate upwards. If the temperature of their range increases between during the winter, they would lose at least 20% of their range and at most 77% of their range. This highlights the fragility of the balance of their ecosystems, especially considering that they are not migratory birds.

Aside from the wild habitat they traditionally live in, they also find comfort among rural and suburban area. This shows they are either reluctant to give up their given range or that they enjoy a greater quality of life within less densely populated human settlements.

== Behavior and ecology ==
The California towhee feeds on the ground or in low scrub where it prefers a variety of seeds, grasses, and herbs. When eating grass seeds, towhees can strip all seeds off at once using its beak. During breeding season, the California towhee supplements its diet with insects such as grasshoppers and beetles. Additionally, they may eat snails, millipedes, and spiders. It is most often seen traveling or feeding singly or in pairs. It is very active on the ground. The California towhee uses a &quot;double-scratch&quot; maneuver when foraging, looking beneath leaves by lunging forward and hopping backwards, using its feet to scratch the ground and reveal food. Additionally, it visits feeders, often eating the millet that other birds disdain. Able to run rapidly for short distances, it keeps in constant contact with its mate—perhaps forming lifelong pairs.

While the towhee is seen drinking freely in the wild and in captivity, in drier habitats their water needs may be met mostly via feeding on insects and succulent foods.

The call consists of a single-note sound that different people hear as &#x27; or &#x27; and the song consists of a long repeating series ended with a trill.

=== Nesting ===
Nests are typically found in low branches or shrubs about above ground. The nest is a bulky cup made of twigs, stems, grasses, and hair, and is constructed by female towhees.

The female incubates the nest of 2 to 4 eggs alone for 11–14 days. Eggs are laid from March through September with shells that are slightly glossy and pale bluish white with some brownish flecks concentrated mostly on the larger end. At the time of hatching, the young have sparse down feathers. Young leave the nest after 6–11 days.

The California towhee breeding season lasts from early April to early August, peaking in late May or early June. Towhees may raise 2–3 broods each year.

== Conservation ==
Within the half century of 1966–2015, the population of the California towhee was stable, with a slight decline in population due to increased temperatures and urbanization. The organization, Partners in Flight estimates that 61% of actively breeding California towhees live in the United States, while the remainder live in Baja California, Mexico. This bird has a global breeding population of around nine million birds spread across this range, making them a minimally threatened species. While the species in general is not under threat, a sub-species (&quot;M. c. eremophilus&quot;) of the California towhee in the Inyo mountains of Eastern California was previously down to around 175 breeding birds in the early 1980s. They had been mostly displaced by increasing agricultural projects and destruction of habitat to accommodate these projects.

Because the California towhee is generally known to be a less threatened bird, these Inyo California towhees were not receiving the conservation efforts to be able to sustainably recover their populations and recover lost habitats. If trends had continued, they might have required to have been repopulated by local wildlife sources, however, in 2001 the Bureau of Land Management enacted a reform to reduce mining, livestock agriculture, and general habitat displacement practices which has helped aid this subspecies to over 700 living birds today. Although significant progress has been made, they still must be protected against human interventions and feral burros.  

== Relationship with humans ==
California towhees have adapted to human presence in California. As suburbs and cities were developed in the state, towhees have moved into parks in lowland towns, as well as backyards with appropriate shrubbery. Consequently, they are found eating garden produce, such as apricots, plums, and peas.

Because they are ground foragers, California towhees are more likely to be attracted by feed spread on the ground than in hanging feeders.

Chase was born in 1927 in Cleveland, Ohio. Her father was a Western Reserve University Science Instructor and she grew up with her family in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. After graduating from Cleveland Heights High School, she received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the College of Wooster in 1950, then worked as a research assistant before returning to school in 1959 and receiving a PhD in Microbiology from the University of Southern California in 1964.

==Research and later life==

In 1950, Chase began working as a research assistant at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the laboratory of bacteriologist and geneticist Alfred Hershey. In 1952, she and Hershey performed the Hershey–Chase experiment, which helped to confirm that genetic information is held and transmitted by DNA, not by protein. The experiment involved radioactively labeling either protein or nucleic acid of the bacteriophage T2 (a virus that infects bacteria) and seeing which component entered &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; upon infection. They found that nucleic acids but not protein were transferred, helping resolve controversy over the composition of hereditary information. Hershey won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery in 1969, but Chase was not included.

Chase left Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1953 and worked with Gus Doermann at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, and later at the University of Rochester. Throughout the 1950s, she returned yearly to Cold Spring Harbor to take part in meetings of the Phage Group of biologists. In 1959, she began doctoral studies at University of Southern California in the laboratory of Giuseppe Bertani. Bertani moved to Sweden and Chase finished her thesis with Margaret Lieb in 1964.

While in California, Chase met and married fellow scientist Richard Epstein in the late 1950s and changed her name to Martha C. Epstein. The marriage was brief and they divorced shortly after with no children. A series of personal setbacks through the 1960s ended her career in science. She moved back to Ohio to live with family and spent the last decades of her life suffering from a form of dementia that robbed her of short-term memory. She died of pneumonia on August 8, 2003, at the age of 75.

==Namesakes==
The family &quot;Chaseviridae&quot;, a group of bacteriophages in order &quot;Caudovirales&quot;, was named in honor of Martha Chase.

<text>A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a hash algorithm (a map of an arbitrary binary string to a binary string with a fixed size of formula_1 bits) that has special properties desirable for a cryptographic application:
* the probability of a particular formula_1-bit output result (hash value) for a random input string (&quot;message&quot;) is formula_3 (as for any good hash), so the hash value can be used as a representative of the message; 
* finding an input string that matches a given hash value (a &quot;pre-image&quot;) is infeasible, &quot;assuming all input strings are equally likely.&quot; The &quot;resistance&quot; to such search is quantified as security strength: a cryptographic hash with formula_1 bits of hash value is expected to have a &quot;preimage resistance&quot; strength of formula_1 bits, unless the space of possible input values is significantly smaller than formula_6 (a practical example can be found in ); 
* a &quot;second preimage&quot; resistance strength, with the same expectations, refers to a similar problem of finding a second message that matches the given hash value when one message is already known;
* finding any pair of different messages that yield the same hash value (a &quot;collision&quot;) is also infeasible: a cryptographic hash is expected to have a &quot;collision resistance&quot; strength of formula_7 bits (lower due to the birthday paradox). 

Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (&quot;digital&quot;) &quot;fingerprints&quot;, &quot;checksums&quot;, or just &quot;hash values&quot;, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.

Non-cryptographic hash functions are used in hash tables and to detect accidental errors; their constructions frequently provide no resistance to a deliberate attack. For example, a denial-of-service attack on hash tables is possible if the collisions are easy to find, as in the case of linear cyclic redundancy check (CRC) functions.

== Properties ==
Most cryptographic hash functions are designed to take a string of any length as input and produce a fixed-length hash value.

A cryptographic hash function must be able to withstand all known types of cryptanalytic attack. In theoretical cryptography, the security level of a cryptographic hash function has been defined using the following properties:

; Pre-image resistance : Given a hash value , it should be difficult to find any message such that . This concept is related to that of a one-way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks.
; Second pre-image resistance : Given an input , it should be difficult to find a different input such that . This property is sometimes referred to as &quot;weak collision resistance&quot;. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second-preimage attacks.
; Collision resistance : It should be difficult to find two different messages and such that . Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as &quot;strong collision resistance&quot;. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre-image resistance; otherwise, collisions may be found by a birthday attack.

Collision resistance implies second pre-image resistance but does not imply pre-image resistance. The weaker assumption is always preferred in theoretical cryptography, but in practice, a hash-function that is only second pre-image resistant is considered insecure and is therefore not recommended for real applications.

Informally, these properties mean that a malicious adversary cannot replace or modify the input data without changing its digest. Thus, if two strings have the same digest, one can be very confident that they are identical. Second pre-image resistance prevents an attacker from crafting a document with the same hash as a document the attacker cannot control. Collision resistance prevents an attacker from creating two distinct documents with the same hash.

A function meeting these criteria may still have undesirable properties. Currently, popular cryptographic hash functions are vulnerable to &quot;length-extension&quot; attacks: given and but not , by choosing a suitable an attacker can calculate , where denotes concatenation. This property can be used to break naive authentication schemes based on hash functions. The HMAC construction works around these problems.

In practice, collision resistance is insufficient for many practical uses. In addition to collision resistance, it should be impossible for an adversary to find two messages with substantially similar digests; or to infer any useful information about the data, given only its digest. In particular, a hash function should behave as much as possible like a random function (often called a random oracle in proofs of security) while still being deterministic and efficiently computable. This rules out functions like the SWIFFT function, which can be rigorously proven to be collision-resistant assuming that certain problems on ideal lattices are computationally difficult, but, as a linear function, does not satisfy these additional properties.

Checksum algorithms, such as CRC32 and other cyclic redundancy checks, are designed to meet much weaker requirements and are generally unsuitable as cryptographic hash functions. For example, a CRC was used for message integrity in the WEP encryption standard, but an attack was readily discovered, which exploited the linearity of the checksum.

=== Degree of difficulty ===
In cryptographic practice, &quot;difficult&quot; generally means &quot;almost certainly beyond the reach of any adversary who must be prevented from breaking the system for as long as the security of the system is deemed important&quot;. The meaning of the term is therefore somewhat dependent on the application since the effort that a malicious agent may put into the task is usually proportional to their expected gain. However, since the needed effort usually multiplies with the digest length, even a thousand-fold advantage in processing power can be neutralized by adding a dozen bits to the latter.

For messages selected from a limited set of messages, for example passwords or other short messages, it can be feasible to invert a hash by trying all possible messages in the set. Because cryptographic hash functions are typically designed to be computed quickly, special key derivation functions that require greater computing resources have been developed that make such brute-force attacks more difficult.

In some theoretical analyses &quot;difficult&quot; has a specific mathematical meaning, such as &quot;not solvable in asymptotic polynomial time&quot;. Such interpretations of &quot;difficulty&quot; are important in the study of provably secure cryptographic hash functions but do not usually have a strong connection to practical security. For example, an exponential-time algorithm can sometimes still be fast enough to make a feasible attack. Conversely, a polynomial-time algorithm (e.g., one that requires steps for -digit keys) may be too slow for any practical use.

== Illustration ==
An illustration of the potential use of a cryptographic hash is as follows: Alice poses a tough math problem to Bob and claims that she has solved it. Bob would like to try it himself, but would yet like to be sure that Alice is not bluffing. Therefore, Alice writes down her solution, computes its hash, and tells Bob the hash value (whilst keeping the solution secret). Then, when Bob comes up with the solution himself a few days later, Alice can prove that she had the solution earlier by revealing it and having Bob hash it and check that it matches the hash value given to him before. (This is an example of a simple commitment scheme; in actual practice, Alice and Bob will often be computer programs, and the secret would be something less easily spoofed than a claimed puzzle solution.)

== Applications ==

=== Verifying the integrity of messages and files ===
An important application of secure hashes is the verification of message integrity. Comparing message digests (hash digests over the message) calculated before, and after, transmission can determine whether any changes have been made to the message or file.

MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-2 hash digests are sometimes published on websites or forums to allow verification of integrity for downloaded files, including files retrieved using file sharing such as mirroring. This practice establishes a chain of trust as long as the hashes are posted on a trusted site – usually the originating site – authenticated by HTTPS. Using a cryptographic hash and a chain of trust detects malicious changes to the file. Non-cryptographic error-detecting codes such as cyclic redundancy checks only prevent against &quot;non-malicious&quot; alterations of the file, since an intentional spoof can readily be crafted to have the colliding code value.

=== Signature generation and verification ===
Almost all digital signature schemes require a cryptographic hash to be calculated over the message. This allows the signature calculation to be performed on the relatively small, statically sized hash digest. The message is considered authentic if the signature verification succeeds given the signature and recalculated hash digest over the message. So the message integrity property of the cryptographic hash is used to create secure and efficient digital signature schemes.

=== Password verification ===
Password verification commonly relies on cryptographic hashes. Storing all user passwords as cleartext can result in a massive security breach if the password file is compromised. One way to reduce this danger is to only store the hash digest of each password. To authenticate a user, the password presented by the user is hashed and compared with the stored hash. A password reset method is required when password hashing is performed; original passwords cannot be recalculated from the stored hash value.

However, use of standard cryptographic hash functions, such as the SHA series, is no longer considered safe for password storage. These algorithms are designed to be computed quickly, so if the hashed values are compromised, it is possible to try guessed passwords at high rates. Common graphics processing units can try billions of possible passwords each second. Password hash functions that perform key stretching – such as PBKDF2, scrypt or Argon2 – commonly use repeated invocations of a cryptographic hash to increase the time (and in some cases computer memory) required to perform brute-force attacks on stored password hash digests. For details, see .

A password hash also requires the use of a large random, non-secret salt value that can be stored with the password hash. The salt is hashed with the password, altering the password hash mapping for each password, thereby making it infeasible for an adversary to store tables of precomputed hash values to which the password hash digest can be compared or to test a large number of purloined hash values in parallel.

=== Proof-of-work ===
A proof-of-work system (or protocol, or function) is an economic measure to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. A key feature of these schemes is their asymmetry: the work must be moderately hard (but feasible) on the requester side but easy to check for the service provider. One popular system – used in Bitcoin mining and Hashcash – uses partial hash inversions to prove that work was done, to unlock a mining reward in Bitcoin, and as a good-will token to send an e-mail in Hashcash. The sender is required to find a message whose hash value begins with a number of zero bits. The average work that the sender needs to perform in order to find a valid message is exponential in the number of zero bits required in the hash value, while the recipient can verify the validity of the message by executing a single hash function. For instance, in Hashcash, a sender is asked to generate a header whose 160-bit SHA-1 hash value has the first 20 bits as zeros. The sender will, on average, have to try times to find a valid header.

=== File or data identifier ===

A message digest can also serve as a means of reliably identifying a file; several source code management systems, including Git, Mercurial and Monotone, use the sha1sum of various types of content (file content, directory trees, ancestry information, etc.) to uniquely identify them. Hashes are used to identify files on peer-to-peer filesharing networks. For example, in an ed2k link, an MD4-variant hash is combined with the file size, providing sufficient information for locating file sources, downloading the file, and verifying its contents. Magnet links are another example. Such file hashes are often the top hash of a hash list or a hash tree, which allows for additional benefits.

One of the main applications of a hash function is to allow the fast look-up of data in a hash table. Being hash functions of a particular kind, cryptographic hash functions lend themselves well to this application too.

However, compared with standard hash functions, cryptographic hash functions tend to be much more expensive computationally. For this reason, they tend to be used in contexts where it is necessary for users to protect themselves against the possibility of forgery (the creation of data with the same digest as the expected data) by potentially malicious participants.

==== Content-addressable storage ====
== Hash functions based on block ciphers ==
There are several methods to use a block cipher to build a cryptographic hash function, specifically a one-way compression function.

The methods resemble the block cipher modes of operation usually used for encryption. Many well-known hash functions, including MD4, MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-2, are built from block-cipher-like components designed for the purpose, with feedback to ensure that the resulting function is not invertible. SHA-3 finalists included functions with block-cipher-like components (e.g., Skein, BLAKE) though the function finally selected, Keccak, was built on a cryptographic sponge instead.

A standard block cipher such as AES can be used in place of these custom block ciphers; that might be useful when an embedded system needs to implement both encryption and hashing with minimal code size or hardware area. However, that approach can have costs in efficiency and security. The ciphers in hash functions are built for hashing: they use large keys and blocks, can efficiently change keys every block, and have been designed and vetted for resistance to related-key attacks. General-purpose ciphers tend to have different design goals. In particular, AES has key and block sizes that make it nontrivial to use to generate long hash values; AES encryption becomes less efficient when the key changes each block; and related-key attacks make it potentially less secure for use in a hash function than for encryption.

== Hash function design ==

=== Merkle–Damgård construction ===

A hash function must be able to process an arbitrary-length message into a fixed-length output. This can be achieved by breaking the input up into a series of equally sized blocks, and operating on them in sequence using a one-way compression function. The compression function can either be specially designed for hashing or be built from a block cipher. A hash function built with the Merkle–Damgård construction is as resistant to collisions as is its compression function; any collision for the full hash function can be traced back to a collision in the compression function.

The last block processed should also be unambiguously length padded; this is crucial to the security of this construction. This construction is called the Merkle–Damgård construction. Most common classical hash functions, including SHA-1 and MD5, take this form.

=== Wide pipe versus narrow pipe ===
A straightforward application of the Merkle–Damgård construction, where the size of hash output is equal to the internal state size (between each compression step), results in a narrow-pipe hash design. This design causes many inherent flaws, including length-extension, multicollisions, long message attacks, generate-and-paste attacks, and also cannot be parallelized. As a result, modern hash functions are built on wide-pipe constructions that have a larger internal state size – which range from tweaks of the Merkle–Damgård construction to new constructions such as the sponge construction and HAIFA construction. None of the entrants in the NIST hash function competition use a classical Merkle–Damgård construction.

Meanwhile, truncating the output of a longer hash, such as used in SHA-512/256, also defeats many of these attacks.

== Use in building other cryptographic primitives ==
Hash functions can be used to build other cryptographic primitives. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure, care must be taken to build them correctly.

Message authentication codes (MACs) (also called keyed hash functions) are often built from hash functions. HMAC is such a MAC.

Just as block ciphers can be used to build hash functions, hash functions can be used to build block ciphers. Luby-Rackoff constructions using hash functions can be provably secure if the underlying hash function is secure. Also, many hash functions (including SHA-1 and SHA-2) are built by using a special-purpose block cipher in a Davies–Meyer or other construction. That cipher can also be used in a conventional mode of operation, without the same security guarantees; for example, SHACAL, BEAR and LION.

Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) can be built using hash functions. This is done by combining a (secret) random seed with a counter and hashing it.

Some hash functions, such as Skein, Keccak, and RadioGatún, output an arbitrarily long stream and can be used as a stream cipher, and stream ciphers can also be built from fixed-length digest hash functions. Often this is done by first building a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and then using its stream of random bytes as keystream. SEAL is a stream cipher that uses SHA-1 to generate internal tables, which are then used in a keystream generator more or less unrelated to the hash algorithm. SEAL is not guaranteed to be as strong (or weak) as SHA-1. Similarly, the key expansion of the HC-128 and HC-256 stream ciphers makes heavy use of the SHA-256 hash function.

== Concatenation ==

Concatenating outputs from multiple hash functions provide collision resistance as good as the strongest of the algorithms included in the concatenated result. For example, older versions of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) used concatenated MD5 and SHA-1 sums. This ensures that a method to find collisions in one of the hash functions does not defeat data protected by both hash functions.

For Merkle–Damgård construction hash functions, the concatenated function is as collision-resistant as its strongest component, but not more collision-resistant. Antoine Joux observed that 2-collisions lead to -collisions: if it is feasible for an attacker to find two messages with the same MD5 hash, then they can find as many additional messages with that same MD5 hash as they desire, with no greater difficulty. Among those messages with the same MD5 hash, there is likely to be a collision in SHA-1. The additional work needed to find the SHA-1 collision (beyond the exponential birthday search) requires only polynomial time.

== Cryptographic hash algorithms ==

There are many cryptographic hash algorithms; this section lists a few algorithms that are referenced relatively often. A more extensive list can be found on the page containing a comparison of cryptographic hash functions.

=== MD5 ===
MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function, MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. Collisions against MD5 can be calculated within seconds, which makes the algorithm unsuitable for most use cases where a cryptographic hash is required. MD5 produces a digest of 128 bits (16 bytes).

=== SHA-1 ===
SHA-1 was developed as part of the U.S. Government&#x27;s Capstone project. The original specification – now commonly called SHA-0 – of the algorithm was published in 1993 under the title Secure Hash Standard, FIPS PUB 180, by U.S. government standards agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It was withdrawn by the NSA shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS  PUB 180-1 and commonly designated SHA-1. Collisions against the full SHA-1 algorithm can be produced using the shattered attack and the hash function should be considered broken. SHA-1 produces a hash digest of 160 bits (20 bytes).

Documents may refer to SHA-1 as just &quot;SHA&quot;, even though this may conflict with the other Secure Hash Algorithms such as SHA-0, SHA-2, and SHA-3.

=== RIPEMD-160 ===
RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest) is a family of cryptographic hash functions developed in Leuven, Belgium, by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart Preneel at the COSIC research group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and first published in 1996. RIPEMD was based upon the design principles used in MD4 and is similar in performance to the more popular SHA-1. RIPEMD-160 has, however, not been broken. As the name implies, RIPEMD-160 produces a hash digest of 160 bits (20 bytes).

=== Whirlpool ===
Whirlpool is a cryptographic hash function designed by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto, who first described it in 2000. Whirlpool is based on a substantially modified version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Whirlpool produces a hash digest of 512 bits (64 bytes).

=== SHA-2 ===
SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA), first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle–Damgård structure, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a (classified) specialized block cipher.

SHA-2 basically consists of two hash algorithms: SHA-256 and SHA-512. SHA-224 is a variant of SHA-256 with different starting values and truncated output. SHA-384 and the lesser-known SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are all variants of SHA-512. SHA-512 is more secure than SHA-256 and is commonly faster than SHA-256 on 64-bit machines such as AMD64.

The output size in bits is given by the extension to the &quot;SHA&quot; name, so SHA-224 has an output size of 224 bits (28 bytes); SHA-256, 32 bytes; SHA-384, 48 bytes; and SHA-512, 64 bytes.

=== SHA-3 ===
SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) was released by NIST on August 5, 2015. SHA-3 is a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak. The Keccak algorithm is the work of Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. Keccak is based on a sponge construction, which can also be used to build other cryptographic primitives such as a stream cipher. SHA-3 provides the same output sizes as SHA-2: 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits.

Configurable output sizes can also be obtained using the SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 functions. Here the -128 and -256 extensions to the name imply the security strength of the function rather than the output size in bits.

=== BLAKE2 ===
BLAKE2, an improved version of BLAKE, was announced on December 21, 2012. It was created by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O&#x27;Hearn, and Christian Winnerlein with the goal of replacing the widely used but broken MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms. When run on 64-bit x64 and ARM architectures, BLAKE2b is faster than SHA-3, SHA-2, SHA-1, and MD5. Although BLAKE and BLAKE2 have not been standardized as SHA-3 has, BLAKE2 has been used in many protocols including the Argon2 password hash, for the high efficiency that it offers on modern CPUs. As BLAKE was a candidate for SHA-3, BLAKE and BLAKE2 both offer the same output sizes as SHA-3 – including a configurable output size.

=== BLAKE3 ===
BLAKE3, an improved version of BLAKE2, was announced on January 9, 2020. It was created by Jack O&#x27;Connor, Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, and Zooko Wilcox-O&#x27;Hearn. BLAKE3 is a single algorithm, in contrast to BLAKE and BLAKE2, which are algorithm families with multiple variants. The BLAKE3 compression function is closely based on that of BLAKE2s, with the biggest difference being that the number of rounds is reduced from 10 to 7. Internally, BLAKE3 is a Merkle tree, and it supports higher degrees of parallelism than BLAKE2.

== Attacks on cryptographic hash algorithms ==

There is a long list of cryptographic hash functions but many have been found to be vulnerable and should not be used. For instance, NIST selected 51 hash functions as candidates for round 1 of the SHA-3 hash competition, of which 10 were considered broken and 16 showed significant weaknesses and therefore did not make it to the next round; more information can be found on the main article about the NIST hash function competitions.

Even if a hash function has never been broken, a successful attack against a weakened variant may undermine the experts&#x27; confidence. For instance, in August 2004 collisions were found in several then-popular hash functions, including MD5. These weaknesses called into question the security of stronger algorithms derived from the weak hash functions – in particular, SHA-1 (a strengthened version of SHA-0), RIPEMD-128, and RIPEMD-160 (both strengthened versions of RIPEMD).

On August 12, 2004, Joux, Carribault, Lemuel, and Jalby announced a collision for the full SHA-0 algorithm. Joux et al. accomplished this using a generalization of the Chabaud and Joux attack. They found that the collision had complexity 251 and took about 80,000 CPU hours on a supercomputer with 256 Itanium 2 processors – equivalent to 13 days of full-time use of the supercomputer.

In February 2005, an attack on SHA-1 was reported that would find collision in about 269 hashing operations, rather than the 280 expected for a 160-bit hash function. In August 2005, another attack on SHA-1 was reported that would find collisions in 263 operations. Other theoretical weaknesses of SHA-1 have been known, and in February 2017 Google announced a collision in SHA-1. Security researchers recommend that new applications can avoid these problems by using later members of the SHA family, such as SHA-2, or using techniques such as randomized hashing that do not require collision resistance.

A successful, practical attack broke MD5 (used within certificates for Transport Layer Security) in 2008.

Many cryptographic hashes are based on the Merkle–Damgård construction. All cryptographic hashes that directly use the full output of a Merkle–Damgård construction are vulnerable to length extension attacks. This makes the MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool, and the SHA-256 / SHA-512 hash algorithms all vulnerable to this specific attack. SHA-3, BLAKE2, BLAKE3, and the truncated SHA-2 variants are not vulnerable to this type of attack.

== Attacks on hashed passwords ==

Rather than store plain user passwords, controlled-access systems frequently store the hash of each user&#x27;s password in a file or database. When someone requests access, the password they submit is hashed and compared with the stored value. If the database is stolen (an all-too-frequent occurrence), the thief will only have the hash values, not the passwords.

Passwords may still be retrieved by an attacker from the hashes, because most people choose passwords in predictable ways. Lists of common passwords are widely circulated and many passwords are short enough that even all possible combinations may be tested if calculation of the hash does not take too much time.

The use of cryptographic salt prevents some attacks, such as building files of precomputing hash values, e.g. rainbow tables. But searches on the order of 100 billion tests per second are possible with high-end graphics processors, making direct attacks possible even with salt.

The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends storing passwords using special hashes called key derivation functions (KDFs) that have been created to slow brute force searches. Slow hashes include pbkdf2, bcrypt, scrypt, argon2, Balloon and some recent modes of Unix crypt. For KDFs that perform multiple hashes to slow execution, NIST recommends an iteration count of 10,000 or more.

<text>Erwin Finlay-Freundlich (; 29 May 1885 – 24 July 1964) was a German astronomer, a pupil of Felix Klein. Freundlich was a working associate of Albert Einstein and introduced experiments for which the general theory of relativity could be tested by astronomical observations based on the gravitational redshift.

==Life==

He was born in Biebrich, Germany the son of Friedrich Philipp Ernst Freundlich, a manufacturer, and his wife Elizabeth (Ellie) Finlayson. He was one of seven children, all of whom were raised Protestant, despite their father&#x27;s Jewish heritage. His elder brother was Herbert Max Finlay Freundlich. He studied locally, leaving school in 1903. He spent 6 months working in the shipyards of Stettin which inspired him to begin studying shipbuilding at the Charlottenburg Polytechnic in Berlin. However he abandoned this in autumn 1905 to instead study Mathematics and Astronomy at Göttingen. Here he studied under Felix Klein and Karl Schwarzschild.

In 1913 he married Kate Hirschberg.
After finishing his thesis under the direction of Paul Koebe at the University of Göttingen in 1910 and gaining his doctorate (PhD), he became assistant at the Berlin Observatory, where he became associated with Albert Einstein. During an expedition to verify general relativity during a solar eclipse in 1914, World War I broke out and he was interned in Russia, for a few days, before being freed in an exchanging of prisoners. The expedition failed. After the war, he was engaged in the construction of a solar observatory in Potsdam, the &quot;Einsteinturm&quot;, and he was director of the Einstein-Institut. In 1933 Hitler came to power and Freundlich was forced to leave Germany; he had a Jewish grandmother and his wife was Jewish. He was appointed professor at the University of Istanbul, which was reformed by Kemal Atatürk with the help of many German scholars. In 1937 he left Istanbul to take up the post of professor of astronomy at the Charles University of Prague, but this appointment was terminated by the German occupation in 1938.

On the recommendation of Arthur Stanley Eddington he went to St. Andrews University in Scotland, where he lectured in astronomy from 1939. In 1941 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Greaves, Alexander Aitken, Max Born and Robert Schlapp.

In 1951 he was created John Napier Professor of Astronomy. On his retirement in 1959, he returned to his native town Wiesbaden and was appointed professor at the University of Mainz. Freundlich died in Wiesbaden, Germany on 24 July 1964.

==Achievements==

Freundlich researched the deflection of light rays passing close to the Sun. He proposed an experiment, during an eclipse, to verify the validity of Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. Freundlich&#x27;s demonstration would have proven Newton&#x27;s theories incorrect. He did conduct inconclusive tests on the prediction by Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravitation-induced red shift of spectral lines in the Sun, using the solar observatories he had constructed in Potsdam and Istanbul.
In 1953, he proposed with Max Born an alternative explanation of the red shifts observed in galaxies by a tired light model.

<doc id="439536" wikidata="Q697800" url="?curid=439536" title="Pierogi">
<text>Pierogi ( , ; ) are filled dumplings made by wrapping unleavened dough around a filling and cooked in boiling water. They are occasionally flavored with a savory or sweet garnish. Typical fillings include potato, cheese, quark, sauerkraut, ground meat, mushrooms, fruits, or berries. Savory pierogi are often served with a topping of sour cream, fried onions, or both.

Pierogi varieties are associated with the cuisines of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Dumplings most likely originated in Asia and came to Europe via trade in the Middle Ages. However, the dish itself dates back to at least 1682, when Poland&#x27;s first cookbook, &quot;Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw&quot;, was published. The widely used English name pierogi was derived from Polish. In Ukraine and parts of Canada they are known under their Ukrainian name – varenyky&quot;,&quot; or, in some dialects, pyrohy. Pierogi are also popular in modern-day American cuisine where they are sometimes known under different local names.
== Terminology ==

The Polish word is the plural form of , a generic term for one filled dumpling. It derives from Old East Slavic () and further from Proto-Slavic , &#x27;feast&#x27;. While dumplings as such are found throughout Eurasia, the specific name &quot;pierogi&quot;, with its Proto-Slavic root and its cognates in the West and East Slavic languages, including Russian (, &#x27;pie&#x27;) and (, &#x27;small pies&#x27;), shows the name&#x27;s common Slavic origins, antedating the modern nation states and their standardized languages. In most of these languages the word means &#x27;pie&#x27;. However, a recent theory speculates that the words &quot;bierock&quot;, &quot;pierogi&quot; or &quot;pirog&quot; may be derived from Turkic &quot;bureg&quot;.

Among Ukrainians, Russians and their diasporas, they are known as &quot;varenyky&quot; (). The word is the plural form of (), which derives from Ukrainian () &quot;boiling liquid&quot;, indicating boiling as the primary cooking method for this kind of dumpling. The same term is used in the Mennonite community, sometimes spelled &quot;varenikie&quot; or &quot;wareniki&quot;; and &quot;vareniki&quot; among Canadian Doukhobors.

 is the Slovak term for dumplings filled with sheep milk cheese.

 is the Romanian term for filled dumplings. It is derived from Greek , &quot;kaltsúni&quot;, itself a borrowing from Italian calzoni. A similarly named type of dumpling related to, or considered a variety of, pierogi, is known in Belarus as , in Lithuania as , and in Poland as .

Pierogi had a local variant in Poland known as Saint Peter&#x27;s pierogi or &quot;pierogi Świętego Piotra&quot;.

== Origins ==

Because the exact origin of the pierogi is unknown and unverifiable, it is the subject of frequent debate. Dumplings most likely originated in China and became widespread in Europe during the Middle Ages or later periods. Some claim that pierogi were spread by Marco Polo&#x27;s expeditions through the Silk Road, thus suggesting a connection to Chinese mantou. Other sources theorize that in the 13th century, pierogi were brought by Saint Hyacinth of Poland from the Far East (Asia) via what was then the Kievan Rus&#x27;. These became characteristic to Central and East European cuisines, where different varieties (preparation methods, ingredients, fillings) were invented.

== Ingredients and preparation ==

===Fillings===
Pierogi may be stuffed (singly or in combinations) with mashed potatoes, fried onions, quark or farmer cheese, cabbage, sauerkraut, ground meat, mushrooms, spinach, or other ingredients depending on the cook&#x27;s preferences. Dessert versions of the dumpling can be stuffed with sweetened quark or with a fresh fruit filling such as cherry, strawberry, raspberry, bilberry, blueberry, apple, or plum; stoned prunes are sometimes used, as well as jam. For more flavor, sour cream can be added to the dough mixture, and this tends to lighten the dough.

===Preparation===
The dough, which is made by mixing flour and warm water, sometimes with an egg, is rolled flat and then cut into squares with a knife or circles using a cup or drinking glass. The dough can be made with some mashed potato, creating a smoother texture. Another variation, popular in Slovakia, uses dough made of flour and curd with eggs, salt, and water.

The filling is placed in the middle and the dough folded over to form a half circle or rectangle or triangle (if the dough is cut squarely). The seams are pressed together to seal the pierogi so that the filling will remain inside when it is cooked. The pierogi are simmered until they float, drained, and then sometimes fried or baked in butter before serving or fried as leftovers. They can be served with melted butter or sour cream, or garnished with small pieces of fried bacon, onions, and mushrooms. Dessert varieties may be topped with apple sauce, jam, or &quot;varenye&quot;.
==Countries==

===Poland===
Traditionally considered peasant food, pierogi eventually gained popularity and spread throughout all social classes, including the nobility. Cookbooks from the 17th century describe how during that era, pierogi were considered a staple of the Polish diet, and each holiday had its own special kind of pierogi created. They have different shapes, fillings and cooking methods. Important events like weddings had their own special type of pierogi kurniki – baked pie filled with chicken. Also, pierogi were made especially for mournings or wakes, and some for caroling season in January. In the east baked pierogi are a common and well-liked Christmas dish. They were stuffed with potatoes, cheese, cabbage, mushrooms, buckwheat, or millet. The most famous is the Biłgoraj pierogi stuffed with buckwheat, potatoes, and cheese and then baked in the oven.

Pierogi are an important part of Polish festive seasons, particularly Christmas Eve (Wigilia) and Christmastide. They are also served during public events, markets or festivals in a variety of forms and tastes, ranging from sweet to salty and spicy. At the 2007 Pierogi Festival in Kraków, 30,000 pierogi were consumed daily.

Polish pierogi are often filled with fresh quark, boiled and minced potatoes, and fried onions. This type is known in Polish as &quot;pierogi ruskie&quot; (&quot;Ruthenian pierogi&quot;). Other popular pierogi in Poland are filled with ground meat, mushrooms and cabbage, or for dessert an assortment of fruits (berries, with strawberries or blueberries the most common).

Sweet pierogi are usually served with sour cream mixed with sugar, and savory pierogi with bacon fat and bacon bits. Poles traditionally serve two types of pierogi for Christmas Eve supper. One kind is filled with sauerkraut and dried mushrooms, anothersmall &quot;uszka&quot; filled only with dried wild mushroomsis served in clear &quot;barszcz&quot;. &quot;Leniwe pierogi&quot; (&quot;lazy pierogi&quot;) are a different type of food, similar to lazy vareniki (see below), &quot;kopytka&quot;, or &quot;halušky&quot;.

===Ukraine===
Varenyky in Ukraine are a popular national dish, served both as a common everyday meal and as a part of some traditional celebrations, such as Christmas Eve Supper (). In some regions in or bordering modern-day Western Ukraine, particularly in Carpathian Ruthenia and Galicia, the terms &quot;varenyky&quot; and &quot;pyrohy&quot; are used to denote the same dish. However, Ukrainian varenyky are often not pan-fried.

Varenyky play a fundamental role in Ukrainian culture. Contrary to many other countries that share these dumplings, Ukrainians tended to use fermented milk products (soured milk or ryazhanka) to bind the dough together; however, today eggs tend to be used instead. Typical Ukrainian fillings for varenyky include curd cheese, potato, boiled beans, cabbage, mushy peas, plum, currants, sour cherries (and other fruits), meat, fish, and buckwheat.

In Ukraine, varenyky are traditionally topped with sour cream () and butter, as well as with fried onions, and fried pieces of salo (). Whilst traditionally savory, varenyky can also be served as a dessert by simply substituting the filling of the dumpling to a sweet one. Dessert varenyky fillings include sour cherry, bilberries, sweet quark, and various fruits. The central regions of Ukraine are known for their more unusual varenyky, Poltava being known for its flour varenyky filling, in which the dumplings are filled with a mixture of flour, lard and fried pieces of bacon. However, unusual fillings can also be found in other regions, such as the hempseed varenyky from Polissia and Galicia.

A yearly festival commemorating varenyky is held at the Ukrainian ski resort town of Bukovel in the Carpathian Mountains. In 2013, a snow monument to varenyky was made in Bukovel, and was submitted to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the biggest snow varenyk in the world.

In Ukrainian tradition, varenyky were equated with a young moon due to the similar shape, and were used as part of pagan and sacrificial rituals. For example, cheese varenyky would be sacrificed near water springs, and farmers would also believe that varenyky helped bring a rich harvest, so they took homemade dumplings with them to the fields.

===German-speaking regions===
The common term &quot;Pirogge&quot; (pl. &quot;Piroggen&quot;) describes all kinds of Eastern European filled dumplings and buns, including pierogi, pirozhkis and pirogs. Certain types of piroggen, both boiled and baked, were common fare for Germans living in Eastern Europe and the Baltic are still prepared by their descendants living there and in Germany. In particular, baked pīrādziņi are known as &quot;Kurländer Speckkuchen&quot; (&quot;Courland bacon/speck pies&quot;) in the cuisine of Baltic Germans.

&quot;Schlutzkrapfen&quot; closely resemble pierogi; they are common in Tirol and northern Italy&#x27;s German-speaking region of South Tyrol, and are occasionally found in Bavaria. Fillings may include meat or potatoes, but the most widespread filling is a combination of spinach and quark (&quot;Topfen&quot;) or ricotta. Another similar Austrian dish, known as &quot;Kärntner Nudel&quot; (Carinthian noodles), is made with a wide range of fillings, from meat, mushrooms, potato or quark to apples, pears or mint. These regional specialties differ significantly from the most common Swabian filled dumplings known as &quot;Maultaschen&quot;.

===Hungary===
In Hungarian cuisine, the &quot;derelye&quot; is similar to the pierogi, consisting of pasta pockets filled with jam, cottage cheese, or sometimes meat. Derelye is consumed primarily as a festive food for special occasions such as weddings; it is also eaten for regular meals, but this tradition has become rare. 

===Romania and Moldova===
In Romania and Moldova, a similar recipe is called &quot;colțunași&quot;, with regional varieties such as &quot;piroști&quot; in Transylvania and Bukovina regions and &quot;chiroște&quot; in Moldavia region. &quot;Colțunași&quot; is either a dessert filled with jam (usually plum), fresh sour cherries, or cottage cheese, or savory, filled with dill seasoned cheese (telemea or urdă), mashed potatoes, or chopped meat. The dough is made with wheat flour and the colțunași are boiled in salted water, pan-fried in oil, or baked in the oven.

The word is a cognate with Slavic &quot;kalduny&quot;, a type of dumplings. In both Bukovina and Transylvania, the name &quot;piroști&quot; is used in Romanian families of German or Slavic origin and the filling can also be a whole, fresh, seedless plum. The term &quot;colțunaș&quot; is used by native Romanian families and are usually filled with cottage cheese or quark and served topped with sour cream smântână, traditionally called &quot;colțunași cu smântână&quot;.

===Russia and Belarus ===

&quot;Vareniki&quot; are most often filled with potatoes (sometimes mixed with mushrooms), quark cheese, cabbage, beef, and berries. They can be topped with fried onions and bacon, or butter, and served with sour cream. This Ukrainian dish became especially popular in Russia during the Soviet period, when it became part of the menu of public catering and international Soviet cuisine. Pelmeni are significantly different; they are smaller, shaped differently and usually filled with ground meat (pork, lamb, beef, fish) or mushrooms as well as salt, pepper, and sometimes herbs and onions.

In modern Russian, pirozhki always mean a baked, in oven, or sometimes in a frying pan, usually under the lid, dough with filling. For dough with fillings, cooked in boiling water, exact naming is used – vareniki, pelmeni, pozy (steamed), etc.

In Belarus, its close proximity to Poland, Ukraine, and Russia helps create a unique blend which takes up all three. Kalduny are the result, and are one of the most recognizable foods from Belarus.

====Russian Mennonite cuisine====
Due to centuries of close-knit community and mass migration from the Netherlands, northern Prussia, the Russian Empire, and the Americas, the Russian Mennonites developed a unique ethnicity and cuisine. In Russian Mennonite cuisine the pierogi is more commonly called &quot;vereniki&quot; and almost always is stuffed with cottage cheese and served with a thick white cream gravy called &quot;schmaunt fat&quot;. Russian Mennonites will also stuff the &quot;vereniki&quot; with fruit such as Saskatoon berries or blueberries. It is often accompanied with farmer sausage (&quot;formavorscht&quot;) or ham. Mennonite-style &quot;vereniki&quot; is no longer common in Poland, Russia, or Ukraine, but is very common in the Canadian prairies, Chihuahua, Mexico, Paraguay, Bolivia, and other places where Russian Mennonites settled.

===Slovakia===
A traditional dish in Slovak cuisine is , dumplings filled with salty cheese mixed with mashed potatoes. are served with some more (mixed with milk or sour cream, so it has a liquid consistency and serves as a dip) and topped with bacon or fried onion. In Slovakia, are semicircular in shape.

Along with , is one of Slovakia&#x27;s national dishes. Some other varieties include &quot;pirohy&quot; filled with mashed potatoes, apples, jam, or quark.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Klepe are popular in Sarajevo, filled with minced meat, and topped with sour cream, garlic, and paprika.

===Slovenia===

&quot;Ajdovi krapi&quot; (literally buckwheat carps) are a dish popular in the northeastern and Alpine regions of Slovenia. Made with buckwheat rather than wheat flour and filled with a mixture of cottage cheese (&quot;skuta&quot;), millet, and fried onions, they are traditionally topped with pork fat crisps, fried bacon, or fried onion, but today often with butter breadcrumbs. Along with žganci and štruklji, they form a trio of buckwheat-based dishes typical of Slovenian cuisine.

===Turkey===
&quot;Piruhi&quot; is a traditional dish made in some parts of Anatolia which was also existed in Ottoman court cuisine. It is usually made with wheat flour and egg 
and filled with a mixture of Tulum cheese, parsley, and onion. Served with toasted walnuts in butter.

===United States and Canada===

Pierogi were brought to the United States and Canada by Central and Eastern European immigrants. They are particularly common in areas with large Polish or Ukrainian populations, such as the Province of Alberta, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and New York City (particularly in the East Village of Manhattan and Greenpoint in Brooklyn) along with its New Jersey suburbs. Pierogi were at first a family food among immigrants as well as being served in ethnic restaurants. The pierogi in America initially came from Cleveland, Ohio, when the first documented sale of pierogi was made at the Marton House Tavern in Cleveland in 1928. In the post–World War II era, freshly cooked pierogi became a staple of fundraisers by ethnic churches. By the 1960s, pierogi were a common supermarket item in the frozen food aisles in many parts of the United States and Canada, and are still found in grocery stores today.

Numerous towns with Central and Eastern European heritage celebrate the pierogi. They have become a symbol of Polish-American cultural identity. Many families make them together for Christmas. The city of Whiting, Indiana, celebrates the food at its Pierogi Fest every July. Pierogi are also commonly associated with Cleveland, where there are yearly events such as the Slavic Village Pierogi Dash and the Parma Run-Walk for Pierogies. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, also celebrates pierogi. There is a &quot;pierogi race&quot; at every home Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game. In the race, six runners wearing pierogi costumes race toward a finish line. In 1993, the village of Glendon, Alberta erected a roadside tribute to this culinary creation: a fiberglass perogy (preferred local spelling), complete with fork.

The United States has a substantial pierogi market because of its large Central and Eastern European immigrant populations. Unlike other countries with newer populations of European settlers, the modern pierogi is found in a wide selection of flavors throughout grocery stores in the United States. Many of these grocery-brand pierogi contain non-traditional ingredients to appeal to American tastes, including spinach, jalapeño, and chicken.

Pierogi enjoyed a brief popularity as a sports food when Paula Newby-Fraser adopted them as her food of choice for the biking portion of the 1989 Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. For more than a decade thereafter, Mrs. T&#x27;s (the largest American pierogi manufacturer) sponsored triathlons, some professional triathletes and &quot;fun runs&quot; around the country. For many triathletes, pierogi represented an alternative to pasta as a way to boost their carbohydrate intakes.

According to pierogi manufacturer Mrs. T&#x27;s, based in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, pierogi consumption in the United States is largely concentrated in a geographical region dubbed the &quot;Pierogi Pocket&quot;, an area including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Chicago, Detroit, parts of the northern Midwest and southern New England which accounts for 68 percent of annual US pierogi consumption.
Canada has a large Polish population as well as Ukrainian populations, the latter being particularly concentrated in the Prairie provinces. Pierogi (known locally as perogies) are common throughout the country. The Canadian market for pierogi is second only to that of the U.S. market, the latter having been the destination of choice for the majority of Central and Eastern European immigrants before and during World War II.
Packed frozen pierogi can be found wherever Central and Eastern European immigrant communities exist and are generally ubiquitous across Canada, even in big chain stores. Typically frozen flavors include analogs of &quot;ruskie pierogi&quot; filled with potato and either cheddar cheese, onion, bacon, cottage cheese, or mixed cheeses. Homemade versions are typically filled with either mashed potatoes (seasoned with salt and pepper and often mixed with dry curd cottage cheese or cheddar cheese), sauerkraut, or fruit. These are then boiled, and either served immediately, put in ovens and kept warm, or fried in oil or butter. Popular fruit varieties include strawberry, blackberry, blueberry, and saskatoon berry.

Potato and cheese or sauerkraut versions are usually served with some or all the following: butter or oil, sour cream (typical), fried onions, fried bacon or kielbasa (sausage), and a creamy mushroom sauce (less common). Some ethnic kitchens will deep-fry perogies; dessert and main course dishes can be served this way.

The frozen varieties are sometimes served casserole-style with a mixture of chopped ham, onions, peppers, and cheddar cheese or with an Italian-style mixture of ground beef, onions, and tomato sauce.

National chain restaurants in Canada feature the dish or variations. Boston Pizza has a sandwich and a pizza flavored to taste like pierogies, while Smitty&#x27;s serves theirs as an appetizer deep-fried with a side of salsa.

==Lazy noodles and lazy varenyky==

&quot;Lazy varenyky&quot; (, ) in Ukrainian and Russian cuisine or &quot;leniwe pyrohy&quot; in Rusyn are gnocchi-shaped dumplings made by mixing domashniy sir (curd cheese) with egg and flour into quick dough. The cheese-based dough is formed into a long sausage about thick, then cut diagonally into gnocchi, called halushky in Ukrainian and Rusyn and &quot;galushki&quot; in Russian. The dumplings are then quickly boiled in salted water and served with sour cream or melted butter.

The name &quot;lazy varenyky&quot; reflects the quick preparation time of the dish, usually taking 10 to 15 minutes from assembling the simple ingredients to serving the cooked dumplings. Lazy varenyky differ from standard varenyky in the same way that Italian gnocchi differ from ravioli or tortellini: these are fluffy solid dumplings, rather than stuffed pockets of dough. The same dish in Polish cuisine is called &quot;lazy pierogi&quot; ().

== In culture ==
Pierogi have their own patron saint: Saint Hyacinth of Poland, a monk tied to the history of pierogi. He is sometimes called &quot;Święty Jacek z pierogami&quot; (St. Hyacinth with his pierogi) and prayed to under this moniker, this custom is especially tied to the traditional &quot;baked pierogi of St. Hyacinth&quot; of Nockowa in Subcarpathia. In addition, &quot;Święty Jacek z pierogami!&quot; is an old Polish expression of surprise, roughly equivalent to the English language &quot;good grief&quot; or American &quot;holy smokes!&quot; The origin of this usage is unknown.

In Ukrainian literature, varenyky appeared as a symbol of national identity, sometimes stressing its distinction from Russian. In the poem by Stepan Rudansky &quot;Varenyky-Varenyky&quot; (1858), a Russian soldier asks a Ukrainian countrywoman to cook varenyky for him. However, he cannot think of the word &quot;varenyky&quot;, while the woman pretends not to understand him.

The Great Pittsburgh Pierogi Race N&#x27;at, commonly called the Great Pierogi Race, is an American mascot race between innings during a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game that features six contestants racing in giant pierogi costumes: Potato Pete (blue hat), Jalapeño Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow hat), Sauerkraut Saul (red hat), Oliver Onion (purple hat), and Bacon Burt (orange hat).

Though Pierogi simply refers to filled dumplings in Poland and other Slavic countries, they actually hold deeper significance. Traditionally in the medieval ages, the rich enjoyed pierogi as a high-class meal, considering it a delicacy. Pierogi gradually gained popularity due to their affordability and versatility, and people began serving them at festivals, religious holidays, and as a common food for everyone. On festival days and religious occasions such as wigilia, families served pierogi as a symbol of unity. Pierogi also represented ethnic pride in Polish communities and helped unite Poles during difficult times. Entire communities often gathered to spend a day making pierogi together. Pierogi require labor-intensive preparation, symbolizing the tenacity of the Polish people and their ability to overcome hardships. 

===Monuments===
A monument to varenyky was inaugurated in Cherkasy, Ukraine in September 2006. The monument erected at the entrance to a hotel depicts Cossack Mamay (a Ukrainian folklore hero whose fondness for varenyky was narrated by Taras Shevchenko and Nikolay Gogol) eating varenyky from an earthenware pot, with a huge crescent-shaped varenyk behind him.

In 1991, a giant -tall pierogi statue on a fork was erected in the village of Glendon in Alberta, Canada. In January 2010, a pierogi statue was proposed to be erected in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<text>Doppelgänger is the fifth studio album by Christian alternative rock band Daniel Amos issued on their own Alarma! Records label in 1983. It is the second album in their &quot;¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot; album cycle.

==Content==
&quot;Doppelgänger&quot; is much darker than the album that preceded it, &quot;¡Alarma!&quot;. The album starts with the eerie backward sounds of &quot;Hollow Man&quot; (inspired by T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;). Taylor&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Build it For Me&quot;, &quot;Autographs for the Sick&quot;, and &quot;New Car&quot; were sharp attacks on televangelists, anticipating the Jimmy Swaggart/Jim Bakker/Robert Tilton scandals of 1987–88.

&quot;Doppelgänger&quot; is the second of a four-part series of albums by DA entitled &quot;The ¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot;, which also includes &quot;¡Alarma!&quot;, &quot;Vox Humana&quot; and &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;. In the tour that followed the release, the band presented a full multimedia event, complete with video screens synchronized to the music, something that was unusual in the early 1980s for any Christian band. The stage presentation even prompted heckling at some shows.

This album, along with the other three albums from the &quot;Alarma! Chronicles&quot;, was rereleased as part of the &quot;Alarma! Chronicles&quot; book-set in 2000. The book set included three CDs, over 200 pages of lyrics, photos, liner notes, essays, interviews and other information in a hardcover book.

==Reissue==
In 2014, 
Born Twice Records revisited the album as part of its ongoing deluxe reissue series re-issued the album as a two-CD.

The stress in is on the last syllable: . (, singular) is the diminutive form of Russian &quot;pirog&quot;, which means a full-sized pie. Pirozhki are not to be confused with the Polish pierogi (a cognate term), which are called or &quot;pyrohy&quot; in Ukrainian and Doukhoborese, and &quot;vareniki&quot; in Russian.

==Variations==
A typical pirozhok is boat- or rarely crescent-shaped, made of yeast-leavened dough, with filling completely enclosed. Similar Russian pastries (pirogs) of other shapes include coulibiac, kalitka, rasstegai, and vatrushka.

Pirozhki are either fried or baked. They come in sweet or savory varieties. Common savory fillings include ground meat, mashed potato, mushrooms, boiled egg with scallions, or cabbage. Typical sweet fillings are fruit (apple, cherry, apricot, lemon), jam, or tvorog.

Baked pirozhki may be glazed with egg to produce golden color. They may also be decorated with strips of dough.

Pirozhki are usually hand-sized. A smaller version may be served with soups.

<doc id="439551" wikidata="Q3548376" url="?curid=439551" title="Takeshi Kaga">
<text>, real name , is a well-known stage and movie actor in Japan who is best known internationally for his portrayal of Chairman Kaga in the Japanese television show &quot;Iron Chef&quot; produced by Fuji TV.
==Biography==
Kaga was born on October 12, 1950, in the city of Kanazawa in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. His first experience on stage was at the age of seven when he joined the Kanazawa City Boys choral group.

In 1972, he joined the Japanese theatrical company Gekidan Shiki. While with the company, he played the role of Jesus in the Japanese stage production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), and role of Tony in &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1974). In 1980 he left Shiki to play the role of Sanada in the movie &quot;The Beast To Die&quot;. He starred in several movies throughout the 1980s, but his most famous role would be that of &quot;Chairman Kaga&quot;, the eccentric and flamboyant host of &quot;Ryōri no Tetsujin&quot;, a cooking competition show (1993–1999). It became very popular, not only in Japan, but around the English-speaking world. Previously broadcast on the Food Network, then on the Fine Living Network in the United States and on SBS in Australia, under the name &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, the show is now being carried on the Cooking Channel in the United States, and in the UK in Iron Chef UK. The host of &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, Mark Dacascos, is claimed on &quot;ICA&quot; to be Takeshi&#x27;s nephew, though the stated relationship is actually between the fictional characters played by the two men.

Despite his international fame with the show, he has not given up his love for musicals. In 1987 he starred in the popular Japanese production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; as Jean Valjean and Javert. He reprised his role as Valjean in 1995 as the representative of Japan during the encore of the 10th Anniversary Concert of Les Misérables at the Royal Albert Hall in London. During the encore, Valjeans from 17 countries joined the cast on stage. He also starred in &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 2000, and in &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; as well as in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; in 2001. In 2009, he starred in a Japanese-language version of &quot;La Cage aux Folles &quot;.

He has also lent his voice to Japanese anime. Notably, he voiced Jirarudan, an antagonist, in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon the Movie: Revelation Lugia&quot;, the second Pokémon movie, and also sung his theme song, &quot;Ware Wa Collector.&quot; He also notably voiced Dr. Kiriko in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Black Jack: The Two Doctors of Darkness.&quot;

After &quot;Iron Chef&quot; ended, he returned to acting in movies and dramas. He also hosted &quot;Time Shock 21&quot;, a quiz show on Asahi Television in Japan. In 2005, Kaga performed as the lead in the Japanese production of Michael Frayn&#x27;s &quot;Democracy&quot; and starred in the blockbuster film &quot;Sengoku Jieitai 1549&quot;. Kaga also appeared in both installments of the highly successful &quot;Death Note&quot; film series as Soichiro Yagami.

<doc id="439554" wikidata="Q1814753" url="?curid=439554" title="Phossy jaw">
<text>Phossy jaw, formally known as phosphorus necrosis of the jaw, was an occupational disease affecting those who worked with white phosphorus (also known as &quot;yellow phosphorus&quot;) without proper safeguards. It is also likely to occur as the result of use of chemical weapons that contain white phosphorus. It was most commonly seen in workers in the matchstick industry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was caused by white phosphorus vapor, which destroys the bones of the jaw. Modern occupational hygiene practices have since eliminated the working conditions that caused this disease.

==Symptoms==
Those with phossy jaw would usually begin suffering painful toothaches and swelling of the gums. The pain was characterized as &quot;persistent yet progressive ... spreading to neighboring teeth and jawbone&quot;. Over time, pus formation developed penetrating the oral mucosa with the formation of fistula, tooth loss, and recurrent abscesses. Further progression led to the formation of sequestrum (dead bone that has separated from living bone) after three months and necrosis of the jaw within six months. The distinguishing feature of this disease was the eventual separation of the sequestrum which was described as porous and light in weight. The lower jaw was more commonly affected than the upper jaw. Affected bones glowed a greenish-white colour in the dark. The condition also affected the brain, provoking seizures in some chronic cases.

==Treatment==
Treatments included topical antimicrobials, conservative debridement of sequestra and surgery. Surgical removal of the afflicted jaw bones could save the patient; otherwise, death from organ failure would follow. The disease was extremely painful and disfiguring to the patient, with dying bone tissue rotting away accompanied by a foul-smelling discharge. Removal of the jaw bone also had serious effects on patients&#x27; ability to eat, leading to further health concerns including malnutrition.

==Diagnostic imaging==
The clinical features appear first, pain in the teeth and jaw, abscesses, etc. as described above. Once the clinical changes occur and the problem is made known a doctor or dentist could see changes in the jaw bones through radiographs or X-rays. The sequestra, the parts of the bone that die and break off, are light in weight and yellow to brown in color. Thus phossy jaw can be clearly demarcated from similar entities by radiographs. In radiographs, the sequestra present a typical worm-eaten appearance similar to a pumice stone. Sequestra appear osteoporotic and decalcified. Separation of the dead bone from the surrounding bone appears clearly demarcated in the radiographs.

==History==
===Discovery===
The first case of phossy jaw was diagnosed in 1839 by Friedrich Wilhelm Lorinser, a doctor in Vienna. The patient was a female Viennese matchstick maker who had been exposed to the phosphorus vapors over a five-year period. He named the disease &quot;Phosphorimus chronicus&quot;. In 1844 Lorinser reported 22 cases of phossy jaw and established the toxic effects of white phosphorus in matchsticks.

===International and national legislation and public organisations===
====Europe====

In 1872, the Grand Duchy of Finland, part of the Russian Empire, was the first country to place an absolute ban on the manufacture, use and sale of white phosphorus in matches; this was followed by Denmark in 1874 and France in 1897. In Great Britain, a ban on white phosphorus matches became effective on 1 January 1910. The international association for labor legislation, an international conference, met at Berne, Switzerland, in 1906 and pledged to prohibit the manufacture, importation and sale of white phosphorus matches. This treaty was signed by Finland, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, in what is considered as the first international attempt to ban an industrial product.

====United States====
Phossy jaw was publicized by the American Association for Labor Legislation, whose secretary, John B. Andrews, began investigating the disease in 1909 and found more than 100 cases. This report was published in the &quot;Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor&quot;. The White Phosphorus Match Act of 1912, signed by President William Howard Taft on April 9, 1912, required manufacturers who used white phosphorus to register with district collectors of internal revenue and to file periodic notices and returns, levied a tax of two cents per hundred matches and required makers of white-phosphorus matches to affix revenue stamps to the matchboxes.

====Asia====
Russia placed a heavy tax on white phosphorus matches in 1892 which was doubled in 1905. By 1906, the production of white phosphorus matches had been reduced to one match in every fifty. India and Japan banned the use of white phosphorus in 1919 after the United States, followed by China&#x27;s ban on white phosphorus usage in match production in 1925.

==Match industry==
White phosphorus was the active ingredient of most matches from the 1840s to the 1910s. Concern over phossy jaw contributed to the London matchgirls strike of 1888, and although this strike did not end the use of white phosphorus, William Booth and The Salvation Army opened a match-making factory in 1891 that used the much safer, though more expensive, red phosphorus. The Salvation Army also campaigned with local retailers to get them to sell only red phosphorus matches.

However it was not until the use of white phosphorus was prohibited by the international Berne Convention in 1906 and its provisions were implemented in national laws over the next few years that industrial use ceased.

==Mechanism of action of white phosphorus==
In phossy jaw patients, the forensic evidence suggested the conversion of yellow phosphorus to potent amino bisphosphonates by natural chemical reactions in the human body. Yellow phosphorus has a simple chemistry; when combined with H2O and molecules from respiration and some amino acids such as lysine, bisphosphonates result.

==Links to bisphosphonates==
A related condition, medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), has been described as a side-effect of amino-bisphosphonates, a class of phosphorus-based drugs that inhibit bone resorption and are used widely for treating osteoporosis, bone disease in cancer and some other conditions. BON, sometimes called &quot;bis-phossy jaw&quot;, is primarily associated with the use of intravenous bisphosphonates in the treatment of cancer. The percentage incidence of BON from this use is approximately 1000 times higher than the incidence of BON caused by the use of oral bisphosphonates.

<text>Pope Adeodatus II ( 621–17 June 676), sometimes called Deodatus, was the bishop of Rome from 672 to his death. He devoted much of his papacy to improving churches and fighting monothelitism.

==Rise==
Born in Rome in c. 621, Adeodatus was the son of a man named Jovinianus. He became a Benedictine monk of the Roman cloister of St Erasmus on the Caelian Hill. He became Pope on 11 April 672 in succession to Vitalian. His election was ratified by the exarch of Ravenna within weeks, as required during the period of Byzantine papacy.

==Pontificate==
Adeodatus II&#x27;s pontificate is extremely obscure. It coincided with a surge of passionate interest in Pope Martin I and Maximus the Confessor, who were known for resisting the support of the Eastern Roman emperors for Monothelism. In light of this, Pope Adeodatus rejected the 
synodical letters sent to him by Patriarch Constantine I of Constantinople. Because of this, his name was excluded from the diptychs in Constantinople. Adeodatus was active in improving monastic discipline and in the repression of Monothelitism and gave Venice the right to choose its doge. During his pontificate, the Basilica of St. Peter was built at the eighth milestone of the Via Portuensis. St. Erasmus was also reconstructed. Elected as Pope on 11 April 672, Adeodatus II did not get involved in political events and disengaged himself from the events at the time surrounding Monothelitism.

Pope Adeodatus II devoted his reign to the restoration of churches in disrepair. He protected the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul (known as St. Augustine&#x27;s Abbey), exempted Marmoutier Abbey, Tours (Abbey of St. Martin of Tours) from the authority of the Holy See, and led improvements to St. Erasmus&#x27; monastery. He is sometimes called saint and 26 June is given as his feast day, but this is disputed. Adeodatus II&#x27;s papacy did not contribute by a large amount to society. He died on 17 June 676 and was succeeded by Donus.

<doc id="439564" wikidata="Q460136" url="?curid=439564" title="Beverley McLachlin">
<text>Beverley Marian McLachlin (born September 7, 1943) is a Canadian jurist and author who served as the 17th chief justice of Canada from 2000 to 2017. She is the longest-serving chief justice in Canadian history and the first woman to hold the position.

In July 2018, McLachlin began a three-year term as a non-permanent judge on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, the first Canadian jurist nominated to the post. She was re-appointed for a second three-year term in 2021. In June 2024, she announced that she would retire from the court when her term ends on July 29, 2024.

==Early life and education==
McLachlin was born Beverley Gietz in Pincher Creek, Alberta, the eldest child of Eleanora Marian (née Kruschell) and Ernest Gietz. Her parents, who were of German descent, were &quot;fundamentalist Christians&quot; of the Pentecostal Church. She received a B.A. and an M.A. in philosophy as well as an LL.B. degree (winning the gold medal as top student, and serving as notes editor of the &quot;Alberta Law Review&quot;) from the University of Alberta. She was called to the bar of Alberta in 1969, and to the Bar of British Columbia in 1971. McLachlin practised law from 1969 until 1975. From 1974 to 1981, she was a professor at the University of British Columbia.

McLachlin has one son, Angus (born 1976), from her first marriage to Roderick McLachlin, who took care of much of Angus&#x27;s upbringing. Roderick McLachlin died of cancer in 1988, a few days after she was appointed chief justice of the B.C. Supreme Court. In 1992, McLachlin married Frank McArdle, a lawyer and the executive director of the Canadian Superior Courts Judges Association.

==Judicial career==
===Canada===

In April 1981, McLachlin was appointed to the County Court of Vancouver. Five months later, in September 1981, she was appointed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In December 1985, McLachlin was appointed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. In September 1988, McLachlin was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. She was nominated by Brian Mulroney to be made a puisne justice to the Supreme Court of Canada on March 30, 1989. On the advice of Jean Chrétien, McLachlin was appointed the chief justice of Canada on January 7, 2000.

Upon being sworn into the Supreme Court of Canada, she also became a deputy of the Governor General of Canada together with the other justices of the Supreme Court. When Governor General Adrienne Clarkson was hospitalized for a cardiac pacemaker operation on July 8, 2005, McLachlin performed the duties of the governor general as the administrator of Canada. In her role as administrator, she gave royal assent to the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; which legalized same-sex marriage nationally in Canada. She relinquished that task when the governor general returned to good health in late July.

While she was Chief Justice, McLachlin chaired the Canadian Judicial Council. She is also on the board of governors of the National Judicial Institute and on the advisory council of the Order of Canada. She is a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. McLachlin was made a commander of the Legion of Honour by the government of France in 2008. On December 15, 2006, she was appointed a commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John.

In July 2013, during the consultation period prior to appointment for Marc Nadon, Chief Justice McLachlin contacted justice minister Peter MacKay and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office regarding the eligibility of Marc Nadon for a Quebec seat on the Supreme Court. Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that he had refused a phone call from McLachlin on the attorney general&#x27;s advice. Harper&#x27;s comments were criticized by the legal community and a complaint was forwarded to the International Commission of Jurists in Switzerland. The International Commission of Jurists concluded that Beverly McLachlin deserved an apology from Harper, but none had been given as of July 2014.

In May 2015, McLachlin was invited to speak at the Global Centre for Pluralism, and said that Canada attempted to commit &quot;cultural genocide&quot; against aboriginal peoples in what she called the worst stain on Canada&#x27;s human-rights record. University of Regina academic Ken Coates supported McLachlin, and said that she was &quot;only stating what is clearly in the minds of judges, lawyers and aboriginal people across the country&quot;. Others were less sympathetic. Columnist Lysiane Gagnon called the comments &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;highly inflammatory&quot; and suggested that McLachlin had opened herself up to accusations of prejudice. Gordon Gibson, another columnist, said the use of the word &quot;genocide&quot; was incendiary and disproportionate and that the Chief Justice&#x27;s comments made her sound like a legislator.

McLachlin retired from the Supreme Court on December 15, 2017, nine months before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. Her successor as Chief Justice of Canada is Richard Wagner, who was nominated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2017. Her successor as a justice of the court is Sheilah Martin, who was nominated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau through a new process for judicial appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada that permitted, &quot;any Canadian lawyer or judge who fits a specified criteria&quot; to apply.

===Hong Kong===

McLachlin was nominated in March 2018 to become a non-permanent member of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong. The court appoints foreign judges from common-law jurisdictions outside of Hong Kong, of which McLachlin is the first Canadian, to sit as non-permanent members of the court. Her three-year appointment was approved by the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and the chief executive gazetted the appointment effective July 30, 2018. McLachlin&#x27;s appointment was accompanied by those of Brenda Hale, also as non-permanent judge, and Andrew Cheung, as permanent judge, at the court. She was reappointed to the court in 2021 for a second three-year term.

Her service on the court has been criticized amidst the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests and imposition of the National Security Law, which is seen by Western observers as threatening civil liberties in the city. As a Court of Final Appeal judge, McLachlin would be required to uphold the law in appellate judgements. A motion at the Law Society of Ontario to condemn her appointment was defeated 28–17 in February 2021. In June 2022, she announced her decision to remain on the court which she believes to still be independent. McLachlin has stated her intention to retire once her term in Hong Kong expires in July 2024.

=== Other courts ===
McLachlin also serves as an international judge on the Singapore International Commercial Court.

== Judicial philosophy ==
McLachlin has defined the judicial function as one that requires &quot;conscious objectivity&quot;, which she has described as follows:

McLachlin has argued that courts may be justified in changing the law where such a change would accord with changes in society&#x27;s values. She regards &quot;Edwards v Canada (Attorney General)&quot;, in which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council found that women were entitled to sit in the Senate of Canada, as a paradigm case in Canadian law. She has stated &quot;courts are the ultimate guardians of the rights of society, in our system of government.&quot; She has also stated, &quot;I think the court belongs to the Canadian people and it should reflect the Canadian people.&quot;

McLachlin has defended the view that &quot;legal certainty&quot;—the notion that there is one correct answer to a legal question, which judges can discover with diligence—is a &quot;myth&quot;.

Mahmud Jamal, now a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, has argued that McLachlin&#x27;s jurisprudence on the law of federalism is consistent with her &quot;self-described judicial philosophy&quot;, namely that judges are to be &quot;scrupulously non-partisan and impartial&quot;.

== Writing ==
In 2018, McLachlin published a legal thriller novel titled &quot;Full Disclosure&quot;. Her memoir &quot;Truth Be Told: My Journey Through Life and the Law&quot;, was published in 2019. It won the Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing in 2020. McLachlin&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Denial&quot;, was published in 2021 by Simon &amp; Schuster.

==Honours and awards==
McLachlin is the honorary patron of the Institute of Parliamentary and Political Law. From 2016 to 2020, she was a college visitor at Massey College. In 2017, she was elected Visitor of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. She has been awarded with over 31 honorary degrees from various universities, which include:

* Order of Saint John – Commander

<text>Pope Donus (died on 11 April 678) was the bishop of Rome from 676 to his death. Few details survive about him or his achievements beyond what is recorded in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;.

==Election==
Donus was the son of a Roman named Maurice. He became pope on 2 November 676, having been selected to succeed Adeodatus II. By that time, Donus was already elderly.
==Pontificate==
Donus expanded the clergy of Rome with twelve new priests and five deacons. He also consecrated six bishops for various sees. One of these may have been Vitalianus of Arezzo. He had the atrium of Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica paved with large blocks of white marble, and restored other churches of Rome, notably the church of St. Euphemia on the Appian Way and the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls. Donus was shocked to discover a colony of Nestorian monks in Boetianum, a Syrian monastery in Rome. He gave their monastery to Roman monks and dispersed them through the various religious houses of the city in the hope that they would accept Chalcedonian Christianity. The Nestorians were possibly refugees fleeing the Muslim conquest of the Levant. 

During the pontificate of Donus, Archbishop Reparatus of Ravenna returned to the obedience of the Holy See, thus ending the schism created by Archbishop Maurus, who had aimed at making Ravenna autocephalous. Donus&#x27; relations with Constantinople tended towards the conciliatory. On 10 August 678, Emperor Constantine IV addressed him as &quot;the most holy and blessed archbishop of our ancient Rome and the universal pope,&quot; hoping to attract him to engage in negotiations with the patriarch of Constantinople and the Monothelites. He ordered that Pope Vitalianus&#x27; name be put back in the diptychs of those bishops in communion with Constantinople, an act which caused him a great deal of trouble from the Monothelites and Patriarch Theodore I of Constantinople.

Donus died on 11 April 678 and was buried the same day in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He was succeeded by Agatho.

<text>Oscar Buneman (28 September 1913 – 24 January 1993) made advances in science, engineering, and mathematics. Buneman was a pioneer of computational plasma physics and plasma simulation.

==Career==
In 1940 upon completion of his PhD with Douglas Hartree, Buneman joined Hartree&#x27;s magnetron research group assisting the development of radar during World War II. They discovered the Buneman–Hartree criterion for the voltage threshold of a magnetron operation. After the war, Buneman developed theories and simulations of collision-less dissipation of currents called the Buneman instability. This is an example of anomalous resistivity or absorption. It is &quot;anomalous&quot; because the phenomenon does not depend on collisions. Buneman advanced elliptic equation solver methods and their associated applications (as well as for the fast Fourier transforms).

==Personal life==
On 24 January 1993 Oscar Buneman at the age of 79 died near Stanford University. The computer scientist Peter Buneman is his son.

<doc id="439570" wikidata="Q2794113" url="?curid=439570" title="Hate mail">
<text>Hate mail (as electronic, posted, or otherwise) is a form of harassment, usually consisting of invective and potentially intimidating or threatening comments towards the recipient. Hate mail often contains exceptionally abusive, foul or otherwise hurtful language.

The recipient may receive disparaging remarks concerning their ethnicity, sexuality, gender, religion, intelligence, political ideology, sense of ethics, or sense of aesthetics. The text of hate mail often contains profanity, or it may simply contain a negative message. 

Senders of hate mail normally send anonymous letters or pose as someone else (either a different or fictitious individual) in order to avoid being identified and tracked down, as the nature of some hate mail would inevitably result in criminal charges if the sender was identified.

==Notable examples of hate mail==

Hate mail has frequently been issued to footballers and managers by fans of rival football teams, and also by their own fans who are dissatisfied with the performance of an individual player, manager or the team. Neil Lennon, the former Celtic F.C. manager, received hate mail including a package containing a nail bomb from Rangers fans. Two men were jailed for five years in April 2012 for sending a nail bomb to Lennon.

The parents of 10-year-old Holly Wells, a Cambridgeshire girl who was murdered along with her friend Jessica Chapman in the highly-publicised Soham murders in August 2002, received several letters shortly after their daughter&#x27;s body was found, accusing them both of being involved in the murder of the two girls. They also received several letters with content including that they &quot;got what they deserved&quot; for allowing their daughter to play out on the Sabbath. Other letters with sexual content referring to the possible circumstances of her death were also written.

The parents of Sarah Payne, who was murdered in West Sussex in July 2000, received an anonymous letter while she was still missing, accusing her father and grandfather of having murdered her. After Sarah&#x27;s body was found, her parents also received letters berating them for allowing Sarah and her three siblings to play unsupervised on a beach. Her mother, Sara Payne, now a child protection campaigner, closed her Twitter social networking account in November 2014 following a long campaign of abuse by trolls, which included allegations that she had made a vast amount of money from her media work and was &quot;glorying in a lavish lifestyle&quot; as a result, suggestions that Roy Whiting (convicted of Sarah&#x27;s murder) was innocent, threatening messages from Twitter users claiming to be paedophiles, and remarks about the death of her former husband Michael from an alcoholism related illness the previous month.

<doc id="439578" wikidata="Q1138905" url="?curid=439578" title="Crank Yankers">
<text>Crank Yankers is an American television sketch comedy show produced by Adam Carolla, Jimmy Kimmel and Daniel Kellison. It features actual crank calls made by show regulars and celebrity guests, with on-screen re-enactments by puppets. The show premiered on June 2, 2002, on Comedy Central. It returned to MTV2 on February 9, 2007, running again until March 30.

On February 11, 2019, Jimmy Kimmel announced on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that the show would be revived on Comedy Central for a fifth 20-episode season and mark the first project on Kimmel&#x27;s new Kimmelot production imprint. The new season includes pranks on social media and other platforms. Kimmel&#x27;s brother Jonathan Kimmel serves as the showrunner and executive producer. The fifth season premiered on September 25, 2019.

On March 5, 2020, Comedy Central announced &quot;Crank Yankers&quot; had been renewed for a 20-episode sixth season. The sixth season premiered on May 5, 2021.

== Behind the scenes ==
The performers are given a basic outline of a premise by the writers, and call telephone numbers from a list of selected targets (known as &quot;marks&quot;). Using the basic premises, the performers improvise most of their lines, playing off of the responses of their marks, with the intention to keep them on the phone as long as possible.

With the exception of a few outside sources (including previous material from Jim Florentine and the Touch-Tone Terrorists), all the calls are made from Nevada. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 makes it illegal in eleven states to record telephone calls without both parties&#x27; consent. Under Nevada law, only one of the parties has to give consent (i.e., the caller), so prank calls can be recorded without the consent of the prank victims. One result of this was the series&#x27; schedule of creating and airing new episodes was fairly sporadic due to most of the celebrities living in Los Angeles, having Los Angeles-based jobs, and so were only periodically able to go to Las Vegas to make calls. Carolla, for example, took his radio program to Las Vegas once or twice a year, and while there would record new calls for the program.

The puppet designs were drawn by artist Todd James before being constructed based on the various marks&#x27; voices, and, along with a series of stock characters (such as &quot;Niles Standish&quot;, &quot;Bobby Fletcher&quot; and &quot;Special Ed&quot;) based on the performers&#x27; character voices, the calls are re-enacted for the skits.

The main character puppets for the first season were constructed by Bob Flanagan&#x27;s company Den Design with additional puppets built by BJ Guyer, Carol Binion, Rick Lyon, Ron Binion, Jim Kroupa and Artie Esposito. An in-house puppet shop was set up for the following seasons to accommodate the fast-paced schedule of the show and the sheer volume of puppet characters required for each episode.

The puppets are puppeteered by Ron Binion, Rick Lyon, BJ Guyer, Victor Yerrid, Paul McGinnis, Alice Dinnean, Tyler Bunch, Drew Massey, Robin Walsh, Marc Petrosino, &amp; Artie Esposito.

Originally, the show was titled &quot;Prank Puppets&quot;; it was renamed after Comedy Central lawyers deemed that it implied malice.

* Gladys Murphy (voiced by Wanda Sykes): A boisterous black woman who makes embarrassing announcements, generally of a scatological or sexual nature. Her many children do things like gluing her buttocks to the toilet and stealing money from a malfunctioning bank machine.
* Niles Standish (voiced by Tony Barbieri): The British Earl of Yankerville, a rich and eccentric middle-aged pervert with homosexual tendencies. He frequently calls various services and asks for their price, then orders them to &quot;double it&quot; (Once even confusing someone by telling them to &quot;cut it in half, and double it!&quot;). He has an assistant named Cavendish.
* Giles Standish (voiced by Tony Barbieri): Niles&#x27; deformed twin brother.
* Special Ed (voiced by Jim Florentine): Bobby Fletcher&#x27;s mentally challenged younger cousin who constantly repeats himself, makes random comments and shouts his catchphrase &quot;Yay!&quot; until the prank-victim gets frustrated. He makes a cameo in one of Bobby&#x27;s prank calls, &quot;Let Me Put My Brother on the Phone&quot;. In two prank calls of his own (one to a movie theater and one to a video store), Ed reveals that his favorite film is &quot;Air Bud&quot;. In the video-store call, he works in several references to &quot;The Shining&quot;. Ed is not present in the 2019 revival due to the character being deemed too offensive for modern audiences.
* Dick Birchum (voiced by Adam Carolla): A psychotic Vietnam War veteran whose hobbies include carpentry, Shotokan karate, spying on women in their beds or bathrooms by drilling holes or a hidden camera, and gun ownership. He has a 600-pound wife, a large 8-year-old son, and conjoined twin daughters. He lost part of his right leg in the war and 3 right-hand fingers in a carpentry accident. He frequently refers to his time in Vietnam and &quot;smoking hash out of a human skull&quot;.
* Jimmy (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel): A Kimmel-based grown man who lives with his mother. He also has two young children who swear and play juvenile pranks.
* Bobby Fletcher (voiced by Jim Florentine): Ed&#x27;s stoner underachieving older cousin. He is known to belch uncontrollably into the phone, which he uses to his advantage in order to annoy the victims of his prank calls.
* Elmer Higgins (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel): A crabby, elderly man (based on Kimmel&#x27;s grandfather). He makes complaint calls and frequently goes off on unrelated, long-winded tangents about his younger days and various irrelevant subjects. He sometimes mentions his brother Charlie, as well as his gay grandson, Terrence Catheter.
* Helen Higgins (voiced by Susie Essman): Elmer&#x27;s beautiful wife of over 60 years, she is an elderly woman who likes to proposition young men. Her son gave her a pet parrot who is well-versed in profanity. In a late-in-the-series sketch about Elmer wanting driving lessons, he mentions that she has died.
* Landalious &quot;The Truth&quot; Truefeld (voiced by David Alan Grier): A former football player who likes to rap.
* Spoonie Luv (voiced by Tracy Morgan): A smooth-talking African American hip hop-type character who makes lewd and suggestive comments. He often refers to himself as &quot;Spoonie Luv from Up Above&quot;. In one particularly noteworthy prank call, he attempts to sell a video store tapes of himself masturbating.
* Hadassah Guberman (voiced by Sarah Silverman): A Jewish female college student who works various part-time jobs, including conducting surveys for &quot;O&quot; magazine. She frequently asks intrusive questions and makes veiled passive-aggressive insults. Her sexuality and sanity seem highly questionable.
* Terrence Catheter (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel): Elmer Higgins&#x27; grandson is an effeminate redhead who acts as spokesperson for various celebrities, such as Tom Cruise, Bill Cosby, Jared Fogle, J. K. Rowling, Mr. T and the Olsen twins. He calls various places of business to book appearances and asks them to comply with the celebrities&#x27; ridiculous demands.
* Tony Deloge (voiced by Bob Einstein): A loud-mouthed, fast-paced politician who calls random people to pander for votes as &quot;district selectman&quot;. He occasionally tries to use his political power to get things for free.

* Boomer and the Nudge (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel and Patton Oswalt): Two obnoxious morning-radio disc jockeys who call people to make &quot;on-air dares&quot;.
* Junkyard Willie (voiced by the Touch-Tone Terrorists): An obstructionist in the form of a gravelly-voiced black man who is actually an import from the Touch-Tone Terrorists where he is a regular character. He appears in two sketches as a supervisor at YPS (&quot;Yankerville Package Service&quot;).
* Jim Bob the Handicapped Hillbilly (voiced by the Touch-Tone Terrorists): A mentally disabled hillbilly who works with Junkyard Willie at YPS.
* Sav Macauley (voiced by Dane Cook): The overly enthusiastic host of a phone game show, &quot;The Phone Zone&quot;, where he calls people and asks ridiculous random trivia questions for cash prizes and interjects his own sound effects.
* OCD Ken (voiced by Kevin Nealon): An accountant with obsessive–compulsive disorder who prefers cleanliness and even numbers. He often requests people to press the pound key as part of his disorder.
* Danny (voiced by David Alan Grier): A man who repeatedly gets nervous or disgusted causing him to vomit over the phone. The vomit is depicted as an &quot;Exorcist&quot;-like liquid shooting out of the puppet&#x27;s throat. On the show, there is also a minor story arc of Danny marrying a Jewish woman.
* Chip Douglas (voiced by Fred Armisen): A Mexican immigrant who is perpetually building a house with minimal supplies and poor command of the English language. He makes two prank calls to newspaper offices, one to attempt to sell cartoons and the other (a prank call in Spanish) to inform a Spanish-language newspaper that he has not received that day&#x27;s edition.
* Katie (voiced by Katie Kimmel): Kimmel&#x27;s then-12-year-old daughter made occasional appearances from 2003, initially with a few short lines but later making entire crank calls herself (notably pretending to be a drunken 9-year-old trying to order alcohol by phone).
* Kevin (voiced by Kevin Kimmel): Kimmel&#x27;s then-10-year-old son made occasional appearances from 2003, including as Elmer Higgins&#x27; great-grandson.

* Gene Winterbuck (voiced by Dane Cook): A paraplegic young man, who calls libraries requesting books with titles referring to disabilities in an offensive manner, such as &quot;Johnny NoodleLegs&quot;.
* Lou Vilman (voiced by Kevin Nealon): An easily impressed guy who responds &quot;Wow!&quot; to everything.
* Dick Rogers (voiced by Seth MacFarlane): He will often call to complain about issues that would make someone from the 1940s uncomfortable, such as being hit on by men at a gay bar or getting a haircut from a female hairdresser. He also calls the YMCA for help with his alcohol problem.
* The Concierge (voiced by Tony Barbieri): A hotel concierge who calls guests informing them of issues with their room or the building and offering them little compensation, or otherwise inconveniencing their stay.

<doc id="439589" wikidata="Q241701" url="?curid=439589" title="Ann Miller">
<text>Ann Miller (born Johnnie Lucille Collier; April 12, 1923 – January 22, 2004) was an American actress and dancer. She is best remembered for her work in the classical Hollywood cinema musicals of the 1940s and 1950s. Her early film work included roles in &quot;Room Service&quot; with the Marx Brothers and Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;, both released in 1938. She later starred in the musical classics &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949) and &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; (1953). Her final film role was in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001).

In 1960, Miller received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2017, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named her one of the greatest actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

==Early life==
Johnnie Lucille Collier (some sources provide other names, such as Lucille Collier and Lucy Ann Collier) was born on April 12, 1923, at St. Joseph&#x27;s Infirmary in Houston, Texas. She was the only child of mother Clara Emma (née Birdwell) and father John Alfred Collier, a criminal lawyer who represented the Barrow gang, Machine Gun Kelly, and Baby Face Nelson. Her maternal grandmother was of Cherokee descent.

Miller was put in dance classes at the age of five in an attempt to strengthen her legs after suffering from rickets. She came to be considered a child dance prodigy. In a documentary on the making of the compilation film &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! Part III&quot; (1994), she said that Eleanor Powell was an early inspiration.

When Miller was nine, her parents divorced, reportedly due to her father&#x27;s infidelities. Miller later noted that her father &quot;wasn&#x27;t a very good dad.&quot; After the divorce, her mother and she moved to Los Angeles, but her mother struggled to find work due to deafness. Because Miller appeared much older than her true age, she began to work as a dancer in nightclubs and supported her mother. She adopted the stage name Ann Miller, which she kept throughout her career.

==Career==
===1936–1956: Film actress===
====RKO====
In 1936, at age 13, Miller was hired as a showgirl at the Bal Tabarin. Due to employment laws regarding establishments that sold liquor, Miller lied and gave her age as 18. Miller appeared in small roles in films like &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1934), &quot;The Good Fairy&quot; (1935), and &quot;The Devil on Horseback&quot; (1936).

While working at Bal Tabarin, Miller was discovered by Lucille Ball and talent scout/comic Benny Rubin. This led to a contract with RKO Pictures, who also believed that Miller was 18. When RKO discovered her true age later, Miller&#x27;s father provided a fake birth certificate with the name Lucy Ann Collier.

Miller had small appearances for RKO in &quot;New Faces of 1937&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Life of the Party&quot; (1937). Her first major role came as Ginger Rogers’ dancing partner in Gregory La Cava’s &quot;Stage Door&quot; in 1937.

In 1938 and 1939, Miller was a supporting actress in many of the studio&#x27;s films, such as &quot;Radio City Revels&quot;, &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot;, &quot;Room Service&quot;, &quot;Tarnished Angel&quot;, and most notably as the quirky Essie Carmichael in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; (made at Columbia). Her last film at RKO was &quot;Too Many Girls&quot; (1940).

In 1939, Miller made her Broadway debut in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals of 1939&quot;. She remained at RKO until 1940.

Miller was famed for her speed in tap dancing. Studio publicists drafted press releases claiming that she could tap 500 times per minute, but because the stage floors were waxed and too slick for regular tap shoes, she had to dance in shoes with rubber treads on the soles. Then, like all other film dancers of the time -- including Fred Astaire, Eleanor Powell, Gene Kelly, etc., -- she would then loop or &#x27;dub&#x27; the sound of the taps while watching the film and dance on a &quot;tap board&quot; to match her steps in the film.

In later life, Miller claimed to have invented pantyhose in the 1940s as a solution to the continual problem of torn stockings during the filming of dance-production numbers. The common practice had been to sew hosiery to briefs, and if torn, the entire garment had to be removed and resewn with a new pair. Miller asked a hosiery maker to produce a single combined garment.

====Republic and Columbia Pictures====

Miller made two films for Republic, &quot;Hit Parade of 1941&quot; (1940) and &quot;Melody Ranch&quot; (1940) with Gene Autry.

In 1941, Miller signed with Columbia Pictures starring in 11 B musicals from 1941 to 1945, beginning with &quot;Time Out for Rhythm&quot; with Rudy Vallee. Miller followed it with &quot;Go West, Young Lady&quot; (1941), &quot;True to the Army&quot; (1942), &quot;Priorities on Parade&quot; (1942), &quot;Reveille with Beverly&quot; (1943), &quot;What&#x27;s Buzzin&#x27;, Cousin?&quot; (1943), &quot;Hey, Rookie&quot; (1943), &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1944), &quot;Jam Session&quot; (1944), &quot;Carolina Blues&quot; (1945), &quot;Eadie Was a Lady&quot; (1945), and &quot;Eve Knew Her Apples&quot; (1945), a musical remake of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;.

In July 1945, Miller posed in a bathing suit as a &quot;Yank&quot; pin-up girl. She ended her contract in 1946 with one A film, &quot;The Thrill of Brazil&quot;. An advertisement for the film in &quot;Life&quot; featured Miller&#x27;s leg in a stocking tied with a large red bow as the &quot;T&quot; in &quot;Thrill.&quot;

====MGM====
After leaving Columbia and recovering from an injury, Miller was hired as a contract player at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first appearance was in &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), in which she co-starred alongside Fred Astaire and Judy Garland.

During her tenure at MGM, Miller usually appeared as the secondary female lead in musical films such as &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot; (1948), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Watch the Birdie&quot; with Red Skelton, &quot;Texas Carnival&quot; (1951) with Esther Williams, &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot; (1951), &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot; (1952), &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1953), &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; (1953), &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954), &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; (1955), and &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (1956). Her last MGM film was a flop &quot;straight&quot; comedy &quot;The Great American Pastime&quot; (1956).

===1957–1989: Stage work===

As the studio system and musical films began to fade in the late 1950s, Miller turned her attention to theater and television appearances. She became known later for her distinctive appearance, which reflected a studio-era ideal of glamour - large, black, bouffant hair, heavy makeup with a splash of crimson lipstick, and fashions that emphasized her figure and long legs.

In May 1969, Miller made a comeback on Broadway when she took over the title role in the musical &quot;Mame&quot;, dancing a tap number created for her. Miller remained in the role until the show closed in January 1970. The following year, she headlined a television production of &quot;Dames at Sea&quot; alongside Ann-Margret for NBC.

She also appeared in an iconic television commercial for &quot;The Great American Soup&quot; (created by Stan Freberg), in which she rose through the floor atop an eight-foot-high cylinder designed to resemble a giant soup can. The advertisement was intended as a spectacular song-and-dance number in the tradition of the musicals in which she had starred.

Miller began touring with theater productions such as &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;. In 1979, she appeared in the Broadway show &quot;Sugar Babies&quot; with fellow MGM veteran Mickey Rooney, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award. The duo toured the country extensively after the show&#x27;s Broadway run. In 1983, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre, On May 1, 1989, at the age of 66, Miller sang and tap-danced to &quot;42nd Street&quot; at the opening of the Disney MGM Studios, her last live dance performance.

Miller appeared in a special 1982 episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, joined by fellow showbiz legends Ethel Merman, Carol Channing, Della Reese, Van Johnson, and Cab Calloway in a storyline that cast them as older relatives of the show&#x27;s regular characters. Miller also published two books. Her first was an autobiography, &quot;Miller&#x27;s High Life&quot; (1972). Her second was &quot;Tapping into the Force&quot; (1990), a book about her experiences in the psychic world.

===1990–2001: Final projects===

During the 1990s, Miller rose as a popular figure to interview for her time in the Golden Age of Hollywood. She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on British television in 1993, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel at the studios of CBS Television City. That same year, she appeared as a dance instructor in the &quot;Home Improvement&quot; episode &quot;Dances with Tools&quot;. 

Miller&#x27;s last stage performance was a 1998 Paper Mill Playhouse production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;, in which she played hard-boiled Carlotta Campion and received rave reviews for her rendition of the song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;. In 2001, Miller played her last role as landlady Coco in director David Lynch&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;.

Between 1995 and 2001, Molly Shannon parodied Miller several times on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in a recurring sketch titled &quot;Leg-Up!&quot;

==Personal life==
Miller was married three times, to Reese Llewellyn Milner from 1946 to 1947, to William Moss from 1958 to 1961, and to Arthur Cameron from 1961 to 1962. Between marriages, she dated well-known men such as Howard Hughes and Conrad Hilton. In 1944, Louis B. Mayer proposed to her despite his being married.

During her marriage to Milner, Miller became pregnant. During her last trimester, Milner threw her down a flight of stairs, breaking her back and causing her to experience premature labor. Her baby, Mary, lived only three hours on November 12, 1946. Miller filed for divorce shortly after. She alleged that her second husband was also abusive.

===Death===
Miller died from lung cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on January 22, 2004, at the age of 80. Confusion over her age persisted after her death: &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave her age as 82, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said she was 81, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; cautiously said &quot;she was believed to be about 80&quot;. Her remains were interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

For her contribution to the motion-picture industry, Miller has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6914 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her. To honor Miller&#x27;s contribution to dance, the Smithsonian Institution displays her favorite pair of tap shoes, which she playfully nicknamed &quot;Moe and Joe&quot;.

<doc id="439591" wikidata="Q2356650" url="?curid=439591" title="Rusholme">
<text>Rusholme () is an area of Manchester, in Greater Manchester, England, two miles south of the city centre. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 13,643. Rusholme is bounded by Chorlton-on-Medlock to the north, Victoria Park and Longsight to the east, Fallowfield to the south and Moss Side to the west. It has a large student population, with several student halls and many students renting terraced houses, and suburban houses towards Victoria Park.

==History==
===Etymology===
Rusholme, unlike other place names in Manchester with the suffix &quot;-hulme/holme&quot; is not a true water meadow. Its name derives from &quot;ryscum&quot; the dative plural of the Old English &quot;rysc&quot;, a &quot;rush&quot; meaning at the rushes. The name was recorded as Russum in 1235, Ryssham in 1316 and Rysholme in 1551.

===Early history===
Late in the Roman occupation of Britain a hoard of about 200 gold coins was hidden in the valley of the Gore Brook. These date from the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE and were found where Birchfields Road crosses the brook in the 1890s. They are now held in the Manchester Museum.

The name Rusholme first appears in the mid-13th century, when &quot;Russum&quot; is mentioned. A house is known to have existed at Platt at that time, which was replaced by a larger one of black-and-white construction. This remained the home of the Platts until the present classical building replaced it in the mid-18th century. An early record of the Platt estate mentions the Nico Ditch, an 8th or 9th-century Anglo-Saxon linear earthwork running east–west through the area and probably marking an administrative boundary. Tales of battles between Danes and Normans associated with the road names Danes Road and Norman Road are not accepted by historians. Another black-and-white hall at Birch was probably built in the 16th century.

The economy of the area was dependent on agriculture until the 18th century; however during the 17th and 18th centuries there was a growth of cottage industries such as spinning, weaving and brickmaking.

===Social history===

Over the Victorian era, there were several different socio-political meanings of Rusholme. Primarily, it was a township based around a general area known as Rusholme since at least the 13th century. The area grew into a township, and by the beginning of the 19th century, it had its own government responsible for public health, roads, policing, poor relief, and other local government tasks. Rusholme was originally a politically autonomous entity, which was vital to its self-conception as a discrete area even after its incorporation into Manchester. Low-cost terraced housing built between 1880 and 1930 dominates the landscape, along with a sprawling council housing estate from the interwar period.

===Political history===
Richard Cobden, William Royle (author of a history of the township), and Thomas Lowe (1815–1892) were long-time residents. Lowe began working as a baker and became a flour dealer, later a nurseryman and finally the proprietor of a dairy. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was married here in 1877 to Miss Helen Melland.

The Conservative Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw was for 26 years one of the councillors for Rusholme on Manchester City Council, before becoming Lord Mayor of Manchester in 1975–1976. Other local politicians included ward Councillor Paul Shannon, a Liberal Democrat and former deputy leader of the Manchester City Council Liberal Democrat group who was defeated by Ahmed Ali (Labour) in May 2012. Rabnawaz Akbar was elected as a Labour councillor for Rusholme ward in May 2010. Councillor Akbar served on the Citizenship and Inclusion Committee.

==Governance==

Rusholme was formerly a township in the parish of Manchester, in 1866 Rusholme became a separate civil parish, on 26 March 1896 the parish was abolished to form South Manchester. In 1891 the parish had a population of 10,696.

It is served in Westminster by the MP for Manchester Gorton, currently Afzal Khan.

==Geography==
The community is surrounded by Fallowfield to the south, Moss Side to the west, Victoria Park to the east and Chorlton-on-Medlock to the north.
===Platt Fields Park===
A large public park in the south-west, it opened in 1910 and proved popular; it was maintained by a team of up to 50 gardeners until the second half of the 20th century. The centrepiece is a large pleasure lake used for boating and fishing. The grounds contain Platt Hall, several formal gardens, and three dedicated show fields for outdoor events. In 2010, Platt Fields Park received a Green Flag Award for achieving the national standard for parks and green spaces.

==Churches==

The Anglican Church of the Holy Trinity is in Platt Lane. At Birch in Rusholme is the now disused, much older chapel of ease of St James (formerly known as Birch Chapel). The present building was built in 1845–1846 to replace an earlier chapel of 1595. The architect was J. M. Derick and it is in Gothic revival style. The south-west tower is topped by a broach spire; the aisle arcades have five bays. Since its conversion into a nursing home it has been known as St James House. The Housing Group of the St James&#x27;, Birch, Fellowship investigated housing conditions in Chorlton-on-Medlock in 1931.

In Thurloe Street is the Roman Catholic Church of St Edward. The architect was E. W. Pugin and the church was built in 1861–1862. It is small and the exterior sober; the planned south-west tower was never built and there is an apse at the east end. The arcades have short polished granite columns.

A Wesleyan Church once stood on Dickenson Road near the junction with Wilmslow Road. It was designed in the Gothic Revival style by the architects William Hayley &amp; Son, and opened in 1862. The chapel closed to worship in 1937 and after some years in use as a film and television studio, it was demolished in 1975.

==Culture and cultural references==

John Ruskin gave the lectures later published as &quot;Sesame and Lilies&quot; in 1865 at Rusholme Town Hall.

In 1947 the disused Wesleyan church on Dickenson Road was converted into a film studios by Mancunian Films. Between 1947 and 1954 the company produced many feature films at Dickenson Road Studios, including the first Manchester-made feature film, &quot;Cup-Tie Honeymoon&quot; starring Sandy Powell and Pat Phoenix. Many Mancunian productions were filmed in local streets. In 1963 the BBC bought the studios as its northern base and on New Year&#x27;s Day 1964, the first edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was broadcast from the Rusholme premises, presented by Jimmy Savile and opening with The Rolling Stones performing &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;. &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was broadcast from Rusholme until 1967, when the show moved to a larger facility at Lime Grove Studios in London. In 1975 the BBC transferred its operations to the New Broadcasting House in Oxford Road and the Dickenson Road chapel building was demolished. Today, a commemorative plaque affixed to a house marks the site of it.

Rusholme was mentioned in the song &quot;Rusholme Ruffians&quot; by the Smiths on their 1985 album &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;. According to the Smiths&#x27; singer, Morrissey: &quot;[The song] is about going to a fair and being stabbed.&quot;

Mint Royale&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;On the Ropes&quot; contained a track titled &quot;From Rusholme with Love&quot;.

Rusholme was the home of the second indoor ice-skating rink in England, after the London Glaciarium, although this has since been replaced by a grocery store, having spent many years as a cabaret venue (Oceans 11).

==Social and economic conditions==
===Social conditions===
Rusholme is one of the south Manchester areas, along with Moss Side, Longsight, Hulme and Old Trafford, to have suffered from gang-related gun crime and gang activity. However, shooting incidents have declined in recent years.

===Wilmslow Road===
Wilmslow Road is part of the B5117, a thoroughfare running from Parrs Wood north into the city centre, traversing the campuses of the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University. It forms part of what is the busiest bus route in Europe, with many stops being serviced by a bus from one of many different bus companies every 60 to 90 seconds during peak times. A section of this road known locally as the Curry Mile contains at least 70 restaurants, takeaways and kebab houses specialising in the cuisines of South Asia and the Middle East. Appleby Lodge is a 1930s block of flats opposite Platt Fields Park.

==Notable people==
The cricket writer and music critic Neville Cardus (1888–1975) was born in Rusholme, as were musicians Roy Harper (born 1941) and Marc Riley (born 1961), actors Alan Badel (1923–1982) and Tina O&#x27;Brien (born 1983), and the novelist and dramatist Ian Hay: John Hay Beith (1876–1952). Others include Marguerite Addy, a Spanish Civil War nurse and Second World War spy.

<text>The Hog&#x27;s Back is a hilly ridge, part of the North Downs in Surrey, England. It runs between Farnham in the west and Guildford in the east.

==Toponym==
Compared with the main part of the Downs to the east of it, it is a narrow elongated ridge, hence its name.

Jane Austen, in a letter to her sister Cassandra dated Thursday 20 May 1813 from her brother&#x27;s house in Sloane Street, wrote of her journey to London in a curricle via &quot;the Hog&#x27;s-back&quot;

:&quot;Upon the whole it was an excellent journey &amp; very thoroughly enjoyed by me; the weather was delightful the greatest part of the day. ... I never saw the country from the Hogsback so advantageously.&quot; 

This shows that it was known as the Hog&#x27;s Back by Jane Austen&#x27;s time. However, the medieval name for the ridge was &quot;Guildown&quot; (recorded first in 1035 where it was the site of the abduction of Prince Alfred of Wessex by Earl Godwin and then in the Pipe Rolls for 1190 and onwards) but this name is no longer in use. However, the name Guildown is evoked by Guildown Road, a residential road that climbs the southern side of the ridge on the southwestern fringes of Guildford.

The Guild- element of Guildown is the same as that found in Guildford, meaning &quot;gold&quot;. Various explanations have been suggested for the relationship between the names of Guildown and Guildford. Guildown may be an abbreviation of Guildford Down (&quot;the Down by Guildford&quot;). The Hog&#x27;s Back ends at Guildford, which is the point where the River Wey cuts through the North Downs. Alternatively, both Guildown and Guildford may derive independently from a gold-coloured feature; either the yellow flowers of the marsh marigold or the gold-coloured (sandy) soil of the hillside.

== Geology ==
The Hog&#x27;s Back is formed of chalk of Cretaceous age, laid down in shallow seas from the deposition of the calcium carbonate skeletons of micro-organisms. The Hog&#x27;s Back is the surface representation of a monoclinal fold, where once horizontal chalk beds have been folded into steeply sloping layers. Across much of the North Downs, the angle of the chalk as it disappears below the surface is relatively shallow (c. 18° near Dorking), however at the Hog&#x27;s Back, local faulting has produced a much steeper angle (up to 55°). To the north of the ridge lies the London Clay, and to the south the clays of the Wealden Group. The chalk is more resistant to weathering than the flanking clays, leading to the ridge&#x27;s prominence over the surrounding terrain.

The Hog&#x27;s Back gives its name to the geomorphological landform known as a Hogback, which is a long narrow ridge or series of hills with a narrow crest and steep slopes of nearly equal inclination on both flanks.

==Geography==

The Hog&#x27;s Back has a minimum prominence (drop) of , reaching above sea level, the 24th highest hill in Surrey.

Along its course are half panoramas north and south separated by less than viewable from paths alongside the road which runs along the Hog&#x27;s Back (the A31).

The view north includes many towns and villages, including Woking, Ash and Aldershot which on a clear day reaches to London, as far as Canary Wharf, Tower 42, The Gherkin, Wembley Arch and Heathrow Airport. The view to the south is unspoilt and has been designated an area of outstanding natural beauty as well as a site of special scientific interest. These views extend to Hindhead and the Devil&#x27;s Punchbowl.

==History==

The route along the Hog&#x27;s Back is ancient, since its raised position offered travellers a vantage point and also kept them above the thick ancient woodland of the valleys on either side. It was part of the ancient ridgeway which runs from Wiltshire down to the east coast of Kent. The Hog&#x27;s Back might have been &quot;the Via Regia of early deeds and Hundred Rolls&quot;.

The road is part of the highway from London to Winchester. Although there is very little archaeological evidence in support, it has been suggested that a Roman road ran from London to Winchester and that, at this point, it passed, either over the Hog&#x27;s Back or perhaps a little to the north (e.g. &quot;Roman Surrey&quot;, David Bird, 2004). Research on this is continuing.

The original A31 along the Hog&#x27;s Back originally formed part of a road leading directly from Winchester into Guildford High Street and from there into London. However, the modern A31 adopts a slightly less direct and less steep approach to the High Street, and reorganisation of central Guildford into a roundabout road system centred on the Friary Centre (named after the medieval Dominican Friary there) has also broken up this direct stretch of road at the point that it reaches Guildford, where it ends at the junction with the A3.

When the idea of the Pilgrims&#x27; Way to Canterbury was popularised in the nineteenth century, a route over the southern slopes of the Hog&#x27;s back, parallel with the ridgeway and running through Seale and Puttenham, was incorporated in its course. In order to avoid the A31, however, the Pilgrims&#x27; Way does not run along the top of the Hog&#x27;s Back.

The Hog&#x27;s Back stretch of the A31 is now a dual carriageway, but the two directions of the road are separated by a central area of trees, some of them very old. The original road ran along the stretch now occupied by the lanes running from Guildford to Farnham, i.e. from east to west. The other two lanes, running from west to east, which are a little below the high point occupied by the original carriageways, were added in the early 1970s.

==Archaeology ==
Roughly midway along the ridge of the Hog’s Back between Farnham and Guildford (OS grid reference SU911483), the human remains of at least six skeletons were discovered in 1935 when ground was being dug for a new water pipe. They were buried less than a yard from the then-northern edge of the road (now part of the central grass verge between the two carriageways). One of them was buried prone and another showed signs of having originally been bound or trussed, and scholars now believe that they were criminals buried here after execution at different times over an extended period (Reynolds in 2005; Briggs in 2010). Their burial place was at the meeting point of the parishes of Wanborough, Seale (originally Farnham) and Puttenham, which were each in the different hundreds of Woking, Farnham and Godalming respectively. It is suggested by Rob Briggs that an elevated site at the junction of different hundreds and parishes was probably a site of general assembly and he identifies it with the place name Seven Ditches, found in the charter of King Caedwalla of Wessex confirming Farnham to the Bishop of Winchester (following the original grant by King Edward the Elder in 909 AD) (Latin &quot;&quot;); and also in a feoffment defining the Shoelands estate in about 1210 (Latin &quot;“Seuedic”&quot;); and also in the plea rolls of the 1263 Surrey Eyre, noting the hanging of one Robert de la Felde of Send at (Latin) &quot;“Seinedik”&quot;, translated Sendike or Seven Ditches.

==Notable buildings==
On the north side of the Hog&#x27;s Back near the turn off to the village of Seale formerly stood a mansion known as Poyle Hill Lodge. This was once one of the Admiralty semaphore stations because of its high vantage point. In 1935 it became the Hog&#x27;s Back Hotel, initially owned by the Guildford Friary Brewery, and it remains a hotel, now officially known as the Hog&#x27;s Back Hotel and Spa, Farnham.

On the south side of the Hog&#x27;s Back, a little to the east of Poyle Hill, another large mansion was built in 1873 called Great Down, attributed to Robert Kerr. This was demolished in about 1950, but the parkland and other associated buildings, such as a lodge and stables, remain.

Also on the south side is Greyfriars House, a Grade II* listed Arts and Crafts style mansion built in 1896 by the renowned architect Charles Voysey. It is now a boutique wedding venue.

The Hogs Back Brewery is an independent real ale brewery based in Tongham, which is a village just below the Hog&#x27;s Back.

The Hog&#x27;s Back Cafe is in a layby on the Guildford to Farnham (westbound) carriageway of the A31 along the Hog&#x27;s Back, between the turn offs to Puttenham and Seale. It is popular with lorry drivers, who use the cafe and toilets during the day. The hillside adjacent to the A31 layby was a popular site for dogging (viewing or participating in sexual relations in a public place), but recently (2012–13) Guildford police and local residents are curbing these practices.

Towards Guildford, on the north-east side of the Hog’s Back, lie Down Place and Blackwell Farm. The manor of Down Place was demolished in 1963, all that remains today of the estate are the stables where is established Hogs Back Books, the children’s book publisher. 
Once associated with the manor as one of the first model farm in Surrey, Blackwell Farm is now a place of controversies since the University of Surrey, its owner, announced its plan to build a &quot;Garden Neighbourhood&quot; as part of Guildford Borough Council&#x27;s local plan consultation.

<text>USS &quot;Tennessee&quot; (SSBN-734) is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine that has been in commission since 1988. She is the fourth ship and first submarine of the U.S. Navy to be named for Tennessee, the 16th state.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Tennessee&quot; construction was authorized in fiscal year 1980, and the contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 7 January 1982. Her keel was laid down there on 9 June 1986. She was launched on 13 December 1986, sponsored by Mrs. Landess Kelso, and commissioned on 17 December 1988, with Captain Dennis Witzenburg in command of the Blue Crew and Captain Kenneth D. Barker in command of the Gold Crew.

The &quot;Tennessee&quot; was the first &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarine commissioned capable of launching the Trident II ballistic missile (D5). On 21 March 1989, off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, the &quot;Tennessee&quot; attempted the first submerged launch of the D5 which failed four seconds into the flight. Once the problem was understood, relatively simple changes were made and the first successful submerged test launch of a D5 missile was completed on 2 August 1989 by the &quot;Tennessee&quot; Gold Crew.

==Service History==

In 2021, &quot;Tennessee&quot; entered drydock to undergo a major overhaul at TRF Kings Bay, one that the facility says is the longest and most extensive work package it has executed in its history.

In December 2022, &quot;Tennessee&quot; conducted a training exercise in the Atlantic with HMS Victorious (S29).

Commander of the United States European Command, General Christopher G. Cavoli, embarked the &quot;Tennessee&quot; in July 2023 alongside William J. Houston who, at the time, held the position of Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic. They were given a formal tour by the crew.

In July 2023, &quot;Tennessee&quot; made a scheduled port visit to HMNB Clyde in Scotland. Simultaneously, the USS Kentucky (SSBN-737) pulled into the Busan Naval Base in South Korea. This was allegedly conducted as a show of force and to show the capabilities of the U.S. SSBN Fleet. The following year, July 2024, the &quot;Tennessee&quot; made yet another port call to HMNB Clyde. Prior to this, it had conducted operations in the Norwegian Sea alongside the USS Normandy (CG-60), where it was reported that the Norwegian Flag Commodore Trond Gimmingsrud embarked &quot;Tennessee&quot; for a demonstration of SSBN operations. During its transits into HMNB Clyde, HMS Northumberland (F238) was seen escorting the Submarine.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; was awarded the Battle Effectiveness Award in 2023. &quot;Tennessee&quot; additionally won a second &quot;Battle E&quot; award in 2024.

On 22 November 2024, Miss America 2024 Madison Marsh and Georgia Congressman Buddy Carter toured &quot;Tennessee&quot; in Kings Bay, Georgia as the boat was undergoing refit. They were given a formal tour by the crew. They additionally toured the Kings Bay Naval Base.

==In popular culture==
*In Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, &quot;Tennessee&quot; is one of several submarines sent to deal with a Japanese invasion of the Northern Mariana Islands. She is used as a &quot;slow-attack&quot; submarine, relying on her stealthiness and her torpedo tubes in combating Japanese forces. &quot;Tennessee&quot; is also used as a refueling point for a group of attack helicopters.

<doc id="439598" wikidata="Q2976061" url="?curid=439598" title="Natural justice">
<text>In English law, natural justice is technical terminology for the rule against bias (&quot;nemo iudex in causa sua&quot;) and the right to a fair hearing (&quot;audi alteram partem&quot;). While the term &quot;natural justice&quot; is often retained as a general concept, it has largely been replaced and extended by the general &quot;duty to act fairly&quot;.

The basis for the rule against bias is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. Bias can take the form of actual bias, imputed bias, or apparent bias. Actual bias is very difficult to prove in practice whereas imputed bias, once shown, will result in a decision being void without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. Cases from different jurisdictions currently apply two tests for apparent bias: the &quot;reasonable suspicion of bias&quot; test and the &quot;real likelihood of bias&quot; test. One view that has been taken is that the differences between these two tests are largely semantic and that they operate similarly.

The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, and the opportunity to present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the right to a fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.

==Background==
Natural justice is a term of art that denotes specific procedural rights in the English legal system and the systems of other nations based on it. It is similar to the American concepts of fair procedure and procedural due process, the latter having roots that to some degree parallel the origins of natural justice.

Although natural justice has an impressive ancestry and is said to express the close relationship between the common law and moral principles, the use of the term today is not to be confused with the &quot;natural law&quot; of the Canonists, the mediaeval philosophers&#x27; visions of an &quot;ideal pattern of society&quot; or the &quot;natural rights&quot; philosophy of the 18th century. Whilst the term &quot;natural justice&quot; is often retained as a general concept, in jurisdictions such as Australia, and the United Kingdom, it has largely been replaced and extended by the more general &quot;duty to act fairly&quot;. Natural justice is identified with the two constituents of a fair hearing, which are the rule against bias (&quot;nemo iudex in causa sua&quot;, or &quot;no man a judge in his own cause&quot;), and the right to a fair hearing (&quot;audi alteram partem&quot;, or &quot;hear the other side&quot;).

The requirements of natural justice or a duty to act fairly depend on the context. In &quot;Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)&quot; (1999), the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence the content of the duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person&#x27;s legitimate expectations, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker. 

Earlier, in &quot;Knight v Indian Head School Division No 19&quot; (1990), the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect. 

Whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority&#x27;s decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.

==Rule against bias==

===In general===
People are barred from deciding any case in which bias exists or bias may fairly be suspected. This principle embodies the basic concept of impartiality, and applies to courts of law, tribunals, arbitrators and all those having the duty to act judicially. A public authority has a duty to act judicially whenever it makes decisions that affect people&#x27;s rights or interests, and not only when it applies some judicial-type procedure in arriving at decisions.

The basis on which impartiality operates is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. The erosion of public confidence undermines the nobility of the legal system and leads to ensuing chaos. The essence of the need for impartiality was observed by Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in &quot;Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon&quot; (1968): &quot;Justice must be rooted in confidence and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking: &#x27;The judge was biased.&#x27;&quot;

Public confidence as the basis for the rule against bias is also embodied in the often-quoted words of Lord Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, that &quot;[i]t is not merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done&quot;.

===Forms of bias===

====Actual and imputed bias====
Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent. Actual bias is established where it is actually established that a decision-maker was prejudiced in favour of or against a party. However, in practice, the making of such an allegation is rare as it is very hard to prove.

One form of imputed bias is based on the decision-maker being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic—the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. A classic case is &quot;Dimes v Grand Junction Canal&quot; (1852), which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham, in fact, owned several pounds&#x27; worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.

In certain limited situations, bias can also be imputed when the decision-maker&#x27;s interest in the decision is not pecuniary but personal. This was established in the unprecedented case of &quot;R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2)&quot; (1999). In an appeal to the House of Lords, the Crown Prosecution Service sought to overturn a quashing order made by the Divisional Court regarding extradition warrants made against the ex-Chilean dictator, Senator Augusto Pinochet. Amnesty International (AI) was given leave to intervene in the proceedings. However, one of the judges of the case, Lord Hoffmann, was a director and chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd. (AICL), a company under the control of AI. He was eventually disqualified from the case and the outcome of the proceedings set aside. 

The House of Lords held that the close connection between AICL and AI presented Lord Hoffmann with an interest in the outcome of the litigation. Even though it was non-pecuniary, the Law Lords took the view that the interest was sufficient to warrant Lord Hoffmann&#x27;s automatic disqualification from hearing the case. In &quot;Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd&quot; (1999), the Court of Appeal warned against any further extension of the automatic disqualification rule, &quot;unless plainly required to give effect to the important underlying principles upon which the rule is based&quot;.

====Apparent bias====
Apparent bias is present where a judge or other decision-maker is not a party to a matter and does not have an interest in its outcome, but through his or her conduct or behaviour gives rise to a suspicion that he or she is not impartial. An issue that has arisen is the degree of suspicion which would provide the grounds on which a decision should be set aside for apparent bias. Currently, cases from various jurisdictions apply two different tests: &quot;real likelihood of bias&quot; and &quot;reasonable suspicion of bias&quot;.

The real likelihood test centres on whether the facts, as assessed by the court, give rise to a real likelihood of bias. In &quot;R v Gough&quot; (1993), the House of Lords chose to state the test in terms of a &quot;real danger of bias&quot;, and emphasized that the test was concerned with the possibility, not probability, of bias. Lord Goff of Chievely also stated that &quot;the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man&quot;. However, the test in &quot;Gough&quot; has been disapproved of in some Commonwealth jurisdictions. One criticism is that the emphasis on the court&#x27;s view of the facts gives insufficient emphasis to the perception of the public. These criticisms were addressed by the House of Lords in &quot;Porter v Magill&quot; (2001). The Court adjusted the &quot;Gough&quot; test by stating it to be &quot;whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased&quot;. This case therefore established the current test in the UK to be one of a &quot;real possibility of bias&quot;.

On the other hand, the reasonable suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible. Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the Singapore courts.

It has been suggested that the differences between the two tests are largely semantic and that the two tests operate similarly. In &quot;Locabail&quot;, the judges stated that in a large proportion of the cases, application of the two tests would lead to the same outcome. It was also held that &quot;[p]rovided that the court, personifying the reasonable man, takes an approach which is based on broad common sense, and without inappropriate reliance on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed members of the public, there should be no risk that the courts will not ensure both that justice is done and that it is perceived by the public to be done&quot;. 

In the Singapore High Court decision &quot;Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board&quot; (2005), Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang observed that the real likelihood test is in reality similar to that of reasonable suspicion. First, &quot;likelihood&quot; is in fact &quot;possibility&quot;, as opposed to the higher standard of proof centring on &quot;probability&quot;. Secondly, he suggested that &quot;real&quot; in &quot;real likelihood&quot; cannot be taken to mean &quot;actual&quot;, as this test relates to apparent and not actual bias. He also observed that both the court&#x27;s and the public&#x27;s perspectives are &quot;integral parts of a holistic process&quot; with no need to draw a sharp distinction between them.

In contrast, in &quot;Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni&quot; (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, &quot;suspicion&quot; suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. &quot;Reasonable&quot; suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, &quot;likelihood&quot; points towards something being likely, and &quot;real&quot; suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue is the degree to which a particular event is not likely or possible Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in &quot;Gough&quot; and Phang J.C. in &quot;Tang Kin Hwa&quot; in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was &quot;a very significant point of departure&quot;. 

The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in &quot;Tang Kin Hwa&quot; or &quot;Shankar Alan&quot; is preferable.

===Exceptions to the rule against bias===

====Necessity====
There are cases in which a disqualified adjudicator cannot be replaced, as no one else is authorized to act. It has been observed that &quot;disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act&quot;. In such cases, natural justice has to give way to necessity in order to maintain the integrity of judicial and administrative systems.

This issue regarding necessity was raised in &quot;Dimes&quot;. The Lord Chancellor had to sign an order for enrolment in order to allow the appeal to proceed from the Vice-Chancellor to the House of Lords. It was held that his shareholding in the canal company which barred him from sitting in the appeal did not affect his power to enroll, as no one but him had the authority to do so. It was mentioned this was allowed &quot;for this [was] a case of necessity, and where that occurs the objection of interest cannot prevail&quot;.

====Waiver====
The court normally requests that an objection be taken as soon as the prejudiced party has knowledge of the bias. If an objection is not raised and proceedings are allowed to continue without disapproval, it will be held that the party has waived its right to do so.

===Effect of a finding of bias===
In &quot;Dimes&quot;, the judges advised the House of Lords that Lord Cottenham&#x27;s pecuniary interest made his judgment not void, but voidable. This advice is not wrong in the context of a judicial act under review, where the judgment will be held valid unless reversed on appeal.

However, in the cases of administrative acts or decisions under judicial review, the court can only intervene on the grounds of &quot;ultra vires&quot;, hence making the judgment void. Lord Esher said in &quot;Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration&quot; (1894) that the participation of a disqualified person &quot;certainly rendered the decision wholly void&quot;.

==Right to a fair hearing==

===In general===
It has been suggested that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearingmust be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.

Besides promoting an individual&#x27;s liberties, the right to a fair hearing has also been used by courts as a base on which to build up fair administrative procedures. It is now well established that it is not the character of the public authority that matters but the character of the power exercised. However, in the United Kingdom prior to &quot;Ridge v Baldwin&quot; (1963), the scope of the right to a fair hearing was severely restricted by case law following &quot;Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works&quot; (1863). In &quot;R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd.&quot; (1923), Lord Atkin observed that the right only applied where decision-makers had &quot;the duty to act judicially&quot;. In natural justice cases this &quot;dictum&quot; was generally understood to mean that a duty to act judicially was not to be inferred merely from the impact of a decision on the rights of subjects; such a duty would arise only if there was a &quot;superadded&quot; express obligation to follow a judicial-type procedure in arriving at the decision.

In &quot;Ridge v Baldwin&quot;, Lord Reid reviewed the authorities extensively and attacked the problem at its root by demonstrating how the term &quot;judicial&quot; had been misinterpreted as requiring some additional characteristic over and above the characteristic that the power affected some person&#x27;s rights. In his view, the mere fact that the power affects rights or interests is what makes it &quot;judicial&quot; and so subject to the procedures required by natural justice. This removal of the earlier misconception as to the meaning of &quot;judicial&quot; is thought to have given the judiciary the flexibility it needed to intervene in cases of judicial review.

The mere fact that a decision-maker is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by &quot;Ahmed v H.M. Treasury (No. 1)&quot; (2010). The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants&#x27; financial assets and economic resources on the ground that it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 made under the United Nations Act 1946. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was &quot;ultra vires&quot; the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.

===Article 6 of the European Convention===
The right to a fair hearing is also referred to in Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which states:

Article 6 does not, however, replace the common law duty to ensure a fair hearing. It has been suggested that Article 6 alone is not enough to protect procedural due process, and only with the development of a more sophisticated common law will the protection of procedural due process extend further into the administrative machine. Nonetheless, Article 6 supplements the common law. For example, the common law does not impose a general duty to give reasons for a decision, but under Article 6(1) a decision-maker must give a reasoned judgment so as to enable an affected individual to decide whether to appeal.

===Aspects of a fair hearing===

====Prior notice of hearing====
Natural justice allows a person to claim the right to adequate notification of the date, time, place of the hearing as well as detailed notification of the case to be met. This information allows the person adequate time to effectively prepare his or her own case and to answer the case against him or her. In &quot;Cooper v Wandsworth&quot;, Chief Justice William Erle went so far as to state that the lack of notice and hearing afforded to Cooper could be said to be a form of abuse, as he had been treated as if he did not matter. As Lord Mustill famously held in &quot;R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody&quot; (1993): &quot;Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer.&quot;

It has been suggested that the requirement of prior notice serves three important purposes:

*The interest in good outcomes – giving prior notice increases the value of the proceedings as it is only when the interested person knows the issues and the relevant information that he or she can make a useful contribution.
*The duty of respect – the affected person has the right to know what is at stake, and it is not enough to simply inform him or her that there will be a hearing.
*The rule of law – notice of issues and disclosure of information opens up the operations of the public authority to public scrutiny.

The British courts have held it is not enough for an affected person to merely be informed of a hearing. He or she must also be told what is at stake; in other words, the gist of the case.

====Opportunity to be heard====
Every person has the right to have a hearing and be allowed to present his or her own case. Should a person not attend the hearing, even with adequate notice given, the adjudicator has the discretion to decide if the hearing should proceed. In &quot;Ridge v Baldwin&quot;, a chief constable succeeded in having his dismissal from service declared void as he had not been given the opportunity to make a defence. In another case, &quot;Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans&quot; (1982), a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in &quot;Surinder Singh Kanda v Federation of Malaya&quot; (1962), a public servant facing disciplinary proceedings was not supplied with a copy of a prejudicial report by a board of inquiry which the adjudicating officer had access to before the hearing. The Privy Council held that the proceedings had failed to provide him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.

However, this requirement does not necessarily mean the decision-maker has to meet the complainant face to face—&quot;Natural justice does not generally demand orality&quot;. It has been suggested that an oral hearing will almost be as good as useless if the affected person has no prior knowledge of the case. In &quot;Lloyd v McMahon&quot; (1987), an oral hearing did not make a difference to the facts on which the case was based. Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Lord Justice Harry Woolf held that an oral hearing may not always be the &quot;very pith of the administration of natural justice&quot;. It has also been suggested that an oral hearing is only required if issues concerning deprivations of legal rights or legally protected interests arise.

====Conduct of the hearing====
When deciding how the hearing should be conducted, the adjudicator has to ask whether the person charged has a proper opportunity to consider, challenge or contradict any evidence, and whether the person is also fully aware of the nature of the allegations against him or her so as to have a proper opportunity to present his or her own case. In &quot;Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF&quot; (2009), Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers said:

However, when a hearing requires the balancing of multiple issues such as natural justice and the protection of confidential information for national security reasons, both the concerns of public security and the right to a fair trial must be adequately met. It was held by the House of Lords in &quot;AF&quot;, applying the decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights &quot;A v United Kingdom&quot; (2009), that a person accused of terrorism against whom a control order has been issued must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to his special advocate. If this requirement is satisfied, a fair hearing can be conducted without detailed disclosure of confidential information that might compromise national security. On the facts of the case, a special advocate was not permitted further contact with an applicant or his ordinary legal representatives except with permission of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after viewing confidential (or &quot;closed&quot;) materials. 

The House of Lords recognized that although a special advocate&#x27;s usefulness is stymied somewhat from having no further instructions after viewing such materials, if the SIAC decides to issue a control order predominantly on the basis of non-confidential (or &quot;open&quot;) materials, an applicant cannot be regarded as having been denied an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the government&#x27;s beliefs and suspicions about him. If the evidence against the applicant is largely closed but allegations contained in open material are sufficiently specific, an applicant should be able to provide his legal representatives and special advocate with information to refute it (such as an alibi, if the open material alleges he was at a certain place during a certain period) without having to know the detail or sources of the closed evidence. However, if the evidence revealed to the person consists only of general assertions and the case against him is based solely or to a substantive extent on undisclosed adverse evidence, the fair hearing rule under natural justice will not be satisfied.

In such cases, there are strong policy considerations supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair if a person is kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts to be sure that the disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, &quot;if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust&quot;.

The right to be heard in answer to charges before an unbiased tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case &quot;Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore&quot; (1980). During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not hear all the oral evidence and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to undue prejudice. It was held in &quot;Re Teo Choo Hong&quot; (1995) that the function of a lay member of a lawyers&#x27; disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered undue prejudice.

On the basis of reciprocity, if one side is allowed to cross-examine his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity. In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice. However, a genuine &quot;bona fide&quot; mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission is not enough to be a breach of natural justice. This may occur when the submissions were accidentally omitted, or were so unconvincing that it was not necessary to explicitly state the adjudicator&#x27;s findings.

====Right to legal representation====
There is no inherent common law right to legal representation before a domestic tribunal. A tribunal has the discretion to admit either a legally qualified or unqualified counsel to assist the person appearing before it, based on the facts of the case. When assessing whether a party should be offered legal assistance, the adjudicator should first ask whether the right to be heard applies, and, secondly, whether counsel&#x27;s assistance is needed for an effective hearing given the subject matter, bearing in mind the consequences of such a denial.

In &quot;R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant&quot; (1983), Webster J. set out six factors to be considered when deciding whether to allow representation by counsel, namely:

*the seriousness of the charge and the potential penalty;
*whether any points of law are likely to arise.;
*whether the prisoner is capable of presenting his own case;
*whether there are any procedural difficulties faced by prisoners in conducting their own defence;
*whether there is reasonable speed in making the adjudication; and
*whether there is a need for fairness between prisoners or between prisoners and prison officers.

It has also been suggested that where a tribunal hearing concerns the individual&#x27;s reputation or right to livelihood, there is a greater need for allowing legal representation as this vindicates the idea of equality before the law.

When one refuses legal representation, one cannot expect to receive a higher &quot;standard&quot; of natural justice. This was enunciated in Singapore in &quot;Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council&quot; (2008). Dr. Ho, who had been charged with professional misconduct, chose to appear before the council in person and declined to cross-examine the council&#x27;s key witness. Subsequently, he argued that he should have been warned of the legal implications of not being legally represented. The High Court rejected this argument and held he had suffered no prejudice. Dr. Ho had been given a fair opportunity of presenting his own case and, most importantly, had not been deprived of his right to cross-examine the witnesses.

It is also not a court&#x27;s obligation to provide assistance when a party presents his or her case without legal representation. In &quot;Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor&quot; (1998), the accused had appeared in person before a magistrate and had entered a plea of guilt. He later petitioned the High Court for criminal revision, arguing that as the magistrate had not informed him of the defences available to him, his plea had been equivocal. The Court held:

In Singapore, the right to legal representation is contingent on the nature of the inquiry. However, since Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore guarantees equal protection under the law, it has been suggested that greater weightage should be accorded to this procedural right when balancing it against the competing demand of efficiency.

====The decision and reasons for it====
Currently, the principles of natural justice in the United Kingdom and certain other jurisdictions do not include a general rule that reasons should be given for decisions. In &quot;R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw&quot; (1951), Denning L.J. stated: &quot;I think the record must contain at least the document which initiates the proceedings; the pleadings, if any; and the adjudication; but not the evidence, nor the reasons, unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them. If the tribunal does state its reasons, and those reasons are wrong in law, certiorari lies to quash the decision.&quot; It has been stated that &quot;no single factor has inhibited the development of English administrative law as seriously as the absence of any general obligation upon public authorities to give reasons for their decisions&quot;.

Historically, uncontrolled public decisions have led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes the rule of law by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. 

Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority to face up to the people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public&#x27;s eyes.

<text>The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) is a holiness pentecostal megachurch and denomination headquartered in Ebute Metta, Lagos, Nigeria. With presence in 197 countries and territories of the world and more than 5 million members in Nigeria alone, it is one of the biggest church denominations in the world with over 9 million members worldwide.

After the death of founder Pa Josiah Akindayomi in 1980, pastor E.A. Adeboye, a former university lecturer, became its General Overseer in 1981.

==History==
The RCCG was founded in 1952 by Rev. Josiah Olufemi Akindayomi (1909–1980).

Adeboye was a mathematics lecturer at the University of Lagos and had joined the church in 1973. Adeboye was initially a Yoruba-to-English interpreter for Akindayomi&#x27;s sermons. He was ordained a pastor of the church in 1975. His appointment as the leader (styled &#x27;General Overseer&#x27;) of the church in 1981, was formalized by the posthumous reading of Akindayomi&#x27;s sealed pronouncement. In 1990, the Redeemed Christian Church of God Bible School was founded.

Andrew Rice, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, calls the RCCG &quot;one of [Africa&#x27;s] most vigorously expansionary religious movements, a homegrown Pentecostal denomination that is crusading to become a global faith&quot;. The church&#x27;s mission statement states that &quot;In every household, there will be at least one member of Redeemed Christian Church of God in the whole world.&quot;

In 2008, the RCCG had more than 14,000 churches and five million members in Nigeria, and as at 2024, it is present in more than 190 countries.

The international church is structured in different areas throughout the world. The local churches are grouped into regions, with 59 regions currently in Nigeria after the 2024 Annual Convention of the church, held in August. It is also organised throughout most of the world. Notable special spiritual programs are the &quot;Holy Ghost Service&quot;, which holds on the first Friday of every month in Nigeria. Others include the annual &quot;Holy Ghost Convention&quot; that holds in August and the &quot;Holy Ghost Congress&quot; which holds in December.

==Beliefs==
The RCCG website outlines its beliefs in the Bible and the Holy Trinity, that the devil exists, that God formed man in his image, in repentance, in cleansing from sins by God&#x27;s grace, in sanctification, water baptism, Holy Spirit baptism, restitution and that God can heal without medicine (by His divine intervention e.g. through prayer).

<doc id="439612" wikidata="Q361261" url="?curid=439612" title="Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland">
<text>Prince Bertil of Sweden, Duke of Halland (Bertil Gustaf Oskar Carl Eugén; 28 February 1912 – 5 January 1997), was a member of the Swedish royal family. He was the third son of King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught, as well as the uncle of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. From 1973 to 1979, he was heir presumptive to his nephew Carl XVI Gustaf and the Swedish throne.

==Early life==
Bertil was born 28 February 1912 at Stockholm, as the fourth of five children born to Princess Margaret of Connaught and Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden. 
His siblings included: Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Vasterbotten, Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland, Princess Ingrid and Prince Carl Johan, Duke of Dalarna.

The family lived in apartments at Stockholm Palace in Stockholm, at Ulriksdal Palace near the capital in Ulriksdal and at the summer residence: Sofiero Palace in Helsingborg in the southernmost province of Sweden, Scania.

==Royal role==

Bertil was granted a very old dukedom, one that was bestowed in the Middle Ages on various Danish and Swedish royal relatives. After his eldest brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, died in 1947, leaving an infant son, Prince Carl Gustaf, in the line of succession, and because his elder brother Sigvard had already given up his place in the succession (owing to a constitutionally unacceptable marriage), it seemed likely that Bertil could one day become regent. After Carl Gustaf became king, Bertil remained the next in line to the throne (until the birth of Prince Carl Philip in 1979), and continued to act as the King&#x27;s deputy.

When the Act of Succession was changed in 1980, rights to the throne were restricted to Carl XVI Gustaf and his descendants; however, a special addendum was made for Bertil&#x27;s case, so that he became third (and, after the birth of Princess Madeleine in 1982, fourth) in line to the throne.

==Personal life==
Bertil became a naval officer; and, during the Second World War, he served as Swedish naval attaché at the embassy in London.

In 1943, Bertil met his long-term partner, Welsh commoner Lilian Craig. However, in order to preserve his place in the royal succession, Bertil and Lilian did not marry for decades. They lived together discreetly, as a fully private arrangement, from the 1940s until their marriage was announced and took place in 1976. Their common base was a home in Sainte-Maxime, in the south of France.

Since his life with Craig was not official, Prince Bertil&#x27;s single status meant he was suggested as a match for, among others, Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom. After the death of Gustaf VI Adolf in 1973, the new king, Carl XVI Gustaf, married a non-royal woman and approved the marriage of Bertil and Lilian, which took place at Drottningholm Palace on 7 December 1976.

Bertil was fond of cars, owning a rare Aston Martin DB2 and a Chevrolet Corvette. Volvo asked him to open the Volvo Halifax Assembly plant in 1963 in Nova Scotia, Canada. A parking garage in Sainte-Maxime is named after him. The ex-HRH Prince Bertil of Sweden also owned a 1926 Bugatti Type 35 Grand Prix A copy of its original Swedish registration document starting in the name of HRH Prince Bertil in 1939.

Prince Bertil was a keen supporter and practitioner of various sports, notably tennis and boules. In 1947, he was elected Chairman of both the Swedish Sports Confederation and Sweden&#x27;s Olympic Committee. He was also a member of the fine-dining society &quot;La Chaine des Rotisseurs&quot;.

He died at his home the Villa Solbacken in Stockholm in 1997, with Princess Lilian at his side. Their grave is at the Royal Cemetery in Haga Park.

<text>A newsletter is a printed or electronic report containing news concerning the activities of a business or an organization that is sent to its members, customers, employees or other subscribers.

Newsletters generally contain one main topic of interest to its recipients and may be considered grey literature. E-newsletters are delivered electronically via e-mail and can be viewed as spamming if e-mail marketing is sent unsolicited.

The newsletter, sometimes a periodical, is the most common form of serial publication. About two-thirds of newsletters are internal publications, aimed towards employees and volunteers, while about one-third are external publications, aimed towards advocacy or special interest groups.

==History==
In ancient Rome, newsletters were exchanged between officials or friends. By the Middle Ages, they were exchanged between merchant families. Trader&#x27;s newsletters covered various topics such as the availability and pricing of goods, political news, and other events that would influence trade. These commercial newsletters were in effect, the first &quot;serious&quot; outlet for news publishing, from which evolved newspapers.

The first full &quot;newspaper&quot; was &quot;Relation of Strasbourg&quot;, printed in 1609 by Johann Carolus. Many rivals soon followed, such as the German &quot;Avisa Relation oder Zeitung&quot; and the Dutch &quot;Nieuwe Tijdingen&quot;. By the end of the 17th century, several newspapers were established all across Europe, and were often translated into other languages. By the late 17th century, several governments were censoring newspapers, which harmed their development. Wars, like the Thirty Years&#x27; War, also imposed restrictions on trade, which could lead to shortage of paper in addition to censorship.

Government censorship remains in effect in several countries to this day, although several countries now have laws guaranteeing freedom of the press.

===Modernity===
Modern newsletters are usually created and distributed electronically by companies, organizations or individuals.

Newsletter marketing is a form of direct-to-consumer advertising. This is used by companies that want to send information directly to potential and existing customers. When received unsolicited, they can be seen as spam.

Newsletters are also used by organizations to inform their members of ongoing developments.

Writing and distributing personal newsletters by individuals can be observed since the late 2010s in the advent of social networking services. Due to the way the algorithms on such services work, followers may not see the updates someone posts.

==Production==
Many paper newsletters are letter-size pamphlets, sometimes made of side- or corner-stapled letter-size paper, sometimes of saddle-stitched (stapled) tabloid paper.

Until the early 20th century, newsletters were generally produced by letterpress. The development of spirit duplicators and mimeograph machines in the early 20th century made short-run reproduction more economical. In the 1960s, xerographic photocopying became ubiquitous.

<doc id="439633" wikidata="Q525987" url="?curid=439633" title="The Terror State">
<text>The Terror State is the fifth studio album by Pittsburgh punk rock band Anti-Flag, released on October 21, 2003, on Fat Wreck Chords. The album&#x27;s artwork was regarded as somewhat controversial (picturing lead vocalist Justin Sane&#x27;s niece, Rachel, amongst rubble and holding an automatic handgun), and the band was forced to create an alternate version (which was simply all black with the Terror State logo centered) for sale in some larger chain stores, such as Wal-Mart.

On the inside of the cardboard sleeve surrounding the CD case there is a stencil print of GW Bush with text stating &quot;one term President&quot;.

Produced by Tom Morello, &quot;The Terror State&quot; was hailed as Anti-Flag&#x27;s most polished album to date. The album made #1 on KTUH&#x27;s charts on the week of January 19, 2004. As of April 3, 2008, the album had sold 106,000 copies.

&quot;The Terror State&quot; was removed from Spotify in 2023 following the several rape and sexual assault allegations made against Sane. 

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
* Justin Sane - guitar, lead vocals on tracks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14
* Chris Head - guitar, backing vocals

<doc id="439638" wikidata="Q1744046" url="?curid=439638" title="Pincher Creek">
<text>Pincher Creek is a town in southern Alberta, Canada. It is located immediately east of the Canadian Rockies, west of Lethbridge and south of Calgary.

== History ==
For centuries before European settlers reached this area and inhabited it, Indigenous clans of the Blackfoot, Peigan and Kootenai passed through, lived in or frequented the region.

The town received its name in 1868 when a group of prospectors lost a pincer in the small creek at this location. These pincers would have been used as a device for trimming the feet of the horses and thus had some value to the group. In 1874, the North-West Mounted Police came to southern Alberta. One of them discovered the rusting tools in the creek, and they named the area Pincher Creek.

Pincher Creek was officially listed as a place name in the Geological Survey Report, 1880.

In 1876, the NWMP established a horse farm in the area. It closed in 1881, but many of the troops stayed to help the town. James Schofield opened Pincher Creek&#x27;s first store in 1884. By 1885 Pincher Creek had a store known as Schofield &amp; Hyde General Store. Harry Hyde succeeded Schofield as Pincher Creek&#x27;s first postmaster.

In 1898, Pincher Creek was incorporated a village. In 1906, the community was officially incorporated as a town and named &quot;Pincher Creek&quot;. Many residents are descendants of the pioneer families who settled there over 100 years ago.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Strong Chinook winds often blow off the mountains and Pincher Creek can be extremely windy. The Oldman River and Castle River valleys seem to act as a kind of funnel for air masses, arguably making the area around Pincher Creek the windiest in Alberta. Any typical day may see wind speeds of 50–90 km/h, the most violent recorded wind being 177 km/h. The strong winds have given rise to a significant amount of wind farm development in the area, with the towers and blades of wind turbines being a characteristic of the scenery. Another consequence of the breezy conditions is that the weather is mostly sunny and very dry as the wind tends to dissipate cloud cover.

The town was severely affected by a flood that hit the area in 1995 as the peak stream flow discharge of the creek that gave the town its name was 271 cubic meters per second.

On January 10, 1962, a dramatic weather change happened in the area. The temperature in the area rose by 41 °C (74 °F) from -19 °C to 22 °C (-2 °F to 72 °F) in only a few hours.
== Attractions ==

The Kootenai Brown Pioneer Village is a popular tourist stop open year-round. It was named after Kootenai Brown, who was responsible for the preservation of the land Waterton Park now inhabits. The six-acre site is home to over thirty one historical buildings, all on open exhibit. Each July, the Village has a large Canada Day celebration, as well as hosting other community based events through the year. Among over 18,000 artifacts, historical archives are also located on site and accessible to the public.

Pincher Creek is located north of Waterton Lakes National Park, while Beauvais Lake Provincial Park is a drive to the southwest. Castle Mountain Ski Resort is located to the southwest. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump World Heritage Site is to the northeast.

== Airport ==

The town is served by the Pincher Creek Airport which is a general aviation airfield that does not currently have any scheduled passenger airline flights.
== Media ==
Pincher Creek is served by two newspapers, the Sun Media owned Pincher Creek Echo, which publishes on Wednesdays and has been in operation since 1900 and the locally owned Shootin&#x27; the Breeze which has been serving the community since 2011. It is also served by an online news website, the Pincher Creek Voice, established in 2011.

<text>The Wasp (Janet van Dyne) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee, Ernie Hart, and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #44 (June 1963).

Janet van Dyne is usually depicted as having the ability to shrink to a height of several centimeters, fly by means of insectoid wings, and fire bioelectric energy blasts. She is a founding member of the Avengers and the one who gave them their name as well as a longtime leader of the team. She is also the ex-wife of Hank Pym and the stepmother of Nadia van Dyne. The Wasp has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes.

Michelle Pfeiffer portrayed Janet van Dyne in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films while Evangeline Lilly portrayed an original MCU version, [[Hope van Dyne]] (based after Hope Pym), in the films &quot;Ant-Man&quot; (2015), &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019) and &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023).

==Publication history==

Janet van Dyne debuted in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #44 (plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by H. E. Huntley, and drawn by Jack Kirby, June 1963) as Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Pym&#x27;s partner, becoming the Wasp to avenge the death of her father, scientist Vernon van Dyne. She co-starred in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; from issue #44–69 (1963–65). She was also the star of her own backup feature in issues #51–58 (1964).

She was a founding member of the Avengers, appearing in the first issue and giving the team its name. It is with the Avengers that Janet became most well known. At first she was the weak link of the team, but later on became one of the smartest and craftiest of its members. Though she takes leaves of absence throughout the series, she is one of the longest active members and has acted as leader of the team for longer than anyone besides Captain America.

During her absences from the core &quot;Avengers&quot; book, Janet appeared in various other publications, including appearing as a main character in &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; issues #6–10 (1972–73). She has also made sporadic guest appearances in various other books, such as &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

Janet became the leader of the Avengers in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #217 (1982), a position she held until issue #278 (1987), with the exception of a brief period where she handed leadership off to the Vision. She then appeared in issue #32 of &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot; (May 1988), becoming a full-time member in issue #42.

She made occasional appearances in &quot;Avengers&quot; (vol. 3), returning as an active member of the team in issue #27 (2000) before resuming leadership duties. She and Captain America became co-leaders of the team starting in issue #38.

After the events of &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;, Janet appeared in the limited series &quot;Beyond!&quot; before rejoining the Avengers in &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot; #1 (2007). She was presumed dead during the events of &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; in 2008. the Wasp returned in the &quot;Avengers&quot; &quot;End Times&quot; storyline that ran from issue #31 (December 2012) to 34 (January 2013). She then appeared as a member of the Avengers Unity Squad in &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot; and as an Agent of Wakanda in the Fresh Start title of the Avengers. Janet also returned as a romantic interest to Tony Stark in 2018, and left the female lead role of the Iron Man comic book two years later in 2020.

===Design===
In his 1970s run on &quot;The Avengers&quot;, artist George Pérez revamped the character&#x27;s costume a number of times, having a significant impact on the character&#x27;s development:
It became a joke. In the case of the Wasp, I noticed that she has so many costumes that eventually I said &quot;Why not?&quot; I think I was on the book long enough what was once just a little bit of idiosyncrasy about the character became fully part of the character&#x27;s persona.

==Fictional character biography==
===1960s===

Janet van Dyne was born in Cresskill, New Jersey, the socialite daughter of wealthy scientist Vernon van Dyne. When her father is killed by an alien entity unleashed during one of his experiments, Janet turns to his associate Dr. Hank Pym for aid and convinces him to help her. To avenge her father&#x27;s death, she undergoes a biochemical procedure that grants her the ability to grow wings upon shrinking under four feet tall and uses a supply of &quot;Pym particles&quot; by which to change her size. Together, she and Ant-Man defeat the alien and avenge her father. Janet decides to remain as Wasp and be Hank&#x27;s partner as she has fallen in love with him, though Hank initially rejects her feelings due to the similarities between her and his murdered first wife.

During her time as Hank&#x27;s partner, she took part in numerous conflicts with villains who included the Porcupine, Egghead, and Whirlwind (then known as the Human Top). Though initially without any offensive powers, Janet proves to be resourceful, using her ability to communicate with insects to fight, as well as using a pin to poke people as a weapon. Later, she uses a miniature air gun, the original wasp&#x27;s sting.

After the initial confrontation with Loki that brought together the founding Avengers, it is Janet and Hank who propose forming a team of superheroes. Janet suggests the name for the team and becomes a founding member. Never lacking confidence or bravery and by nature an outgoing personality, Janet is always in the thick of battles with villains, who include Norse gods and aliens, despite being the most underpowered member of the team. Janet frequently comments on the attractiveness of her male colleagues, especially Thor, to provoke jealousy from Hank and get him to commit to a relationship. Early on in her Avengers career, she is seriously wounded by a stray bullet in battle against Count Nefaria, and nearly dies from a collapsed lung. She leaves the team several issues later. When she returns in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #26, her shrinking powers have progressed to the point where she no longer needs Pym particle capsules to use them.

Though Janet hopes on several occasions that her long-term boyfriend Hank will propose, their relationship does not move forward to that point until something more dramatic happens. The new vigilante Yellowjacket breaks into the Avengers mansion, demands to be admitted as a member of the team, claims to have killed Hank Pym, and then kidnaps Janet. Not believing that Yellowjacket was Hank&#x27;s killer, she attempts to find where Yellowjacket is holding Hank, but instead determines that Yellowjacket is her boyfriend. Before revealing this, and during the period in which Yellowjacket still believes himself to have killed Hank, Janet marries Hank, though the wedding is disrupted by an attack from the Circus of Crime. During the fight, it is revealed that Yellowjacket is Pym.

===1970s===
After another departure from the team, Janet van Dyne returns briefly and becomes a member of the original Lady Liberators, before once more leaving the team. She becomes temporarily trapped at insect size, and battles Whirlwind, Para-Man and Doctor Nemesis. She also battles Equinox alongside Spider-Man and Yellowjacket; during this time her powers are augmented to allow her to harness her body&#x27;s bio-electrical current and fire blasts of energy which she calls her &quot;wasp&#x27;s stings&quot;.

During one of her breaks from active Avengers duty, Janet approaches the team with concerns about her husband having suffered a breakdown and attacked former teammates. In attempting to find a way to help Hank, she is captured by a brainwashed Hank, and used by Ultron as a template to create Jocasta. She is rescued when Jocasta alerts the Avengers to her location, and Black Panther suggests that the A.I.&#x27;s ability to reach out to them was brought about because of Janet&#x27;s personality breaking through.

===1980s===
Janet van Dyne discovers that her husband, now paranoid, overbearing and verbally abusive, has concocted a plan to make himself look good in front of the Avengers by staging an attack that can only be stopped by the instigator. When she attempts to dissuade him, Hank strikes her; she divorces him soon after and takes a very brief break from the team.

When Janet returns to the Avengers, she proposes that the team is in need of new leadership and nominates herself for the role of chairperson. She is elected to the position by Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. Janet takes to the role naturally, proving to be an efficient and smart leader who is praised by Captain America for her leadership skills. She makes it a point to increase the number of women on the team and recruits She-Hulk and Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau).

At the same time as taking on leadership of the team, Janet begins to work in earnest as a professional fashion designer. Part of her friendship with She-Hulk includes designing new clothing for her. She also renews her social life, engaging in a whirlwind romance with Tony Stark before learning that the billionaire is Iron Man. She breaks off the relationship, saying that she cannot date a colleague who is also a friend of her ex-husband. Later, she has a relationship with Paladin, though they are often apart due to their jobs.

Janet briefly hands leadership of the team off to the Vision, though he soon leaves the team and returns the position to her. The new team line-up proves difficult, and Janet clashes with Hercules taking issue with a woman leading. It is during this time that she meets the Space Phantom for the second time and defeats the villain. During the first Secret War, despite being the official leader of the Avengers gathered by the Beyonder, Janet nominates Captain America for leadership of the assembled heroes as the non-Avengers present know him better. As the conflict unfolds, Janet is briefly captured by Magneto, but she turns the situation to her advantage by pretending to be seduced; she learns Magneto&#x27;s plans and then defeats him before leaving to alert the Avengers. She is shortly afterwards killed by the Wrecking Crew, but resurrected by the alien healer Zsaji.

During the &quot;Under Siege&quot; storyline, Janet leads the team during a time where they are attacked from all sides. She defeats Titania and the Absorbing Man, then leads a team against Baron Zemo&#x27;s Masters of Evil to rescue Captain America, the Black Knight, and other team members who have been captured. Shortly after the resolution of this story, she steps down from leadership once more, succeeded by Monica Rambeau in that position. After leaving the team, she battles the threat of Red Ronin by herself. She later joins the West Coast Avengers. Initially, she still acts as though the team leader, to the chagrin of other West Coast Avengers who desire that role. During this time, she resumes a romantic relationship with Hank. Although she is elected as a regular member of the Avengers West, Janet chooses to become a reserve member.

===1990s===
Several years later, Janet van Dyne returns to the Avengers, first at reserve status, and later as a full member of the team. During the Destiny War, the Janet of the present becomes the leader of a team of Avengers assembled from different time periods, cited as being chosen due to her &quot;inner strength and flexibility to give the team direction without exerting too much control&quot;. After the Destiny War, Janet returns to work with the Avengers once more, taking up leadership of the team and commanding the team through a number of conflicts, including Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion of Earth.

===2000s===
Janet van Dyne once more takes up leadership of the Avengers and continues to make sure there is a strong female presence on the team. Under her leadership, the number of women on the team outnumbers the number of men for the first time in Avengers history. Though her relationship with Hank Pym remains strong for some time, she turns down his proposal of remarrying, saying she wouldn&#x27;t marry him again. During the &quot;Lionheart of Avalon&quot; storyline, Janet is shown fighting the Wrecking Crew while at giant size, a power she had rarely, if ever, used prior. She is shown to be powerful enough at this size to take down a jet. She has a brief fling with fellow team member Hawkeye.

====JLA/Avengers====
Janet van Dyne is shown as a member of the Avengers and aids them during the battle with Starro. She also gives Iron Man the idea to create a dimensional alarm and rallies other Avengers to defend the artifacts. After the final battle in the Savage Land against the Justice League, Janet ends up as an Avenger in the new merged world that the villain Krona created and is unaware of the changes. In this world she and Hank are good friends with Elongated Man and his wife Sue Dibny. When the two teams decide to team up against Krona, the Wasp fights alongside the Avengers until the battle is over.

====Avengers Disassembled====
While discussing her fling with Hawkeye, with the Scarlet Witch, a slightly tipsy Wasp confesses to a pregnancy scare and inadvertently mentions Wanda Maximoff&#x27;s own children, whose unnatural existence Agatha Harkness has erased from the Witch&#x27;s memory. Wasp&#x27;s slip of the tongue, combined with Scarlet Witch&#x27;s increasingly unstable and growing powers, cause Wanda to suffer a mental breakdown which leads to the events of &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;. Janet is knocked into a coma by a rampaging She-Hulk during an attack on Avengers Mansion by the Scarlet Witch. Hank Pym watches over her in the hospital, and when she recovers, they reconcile. The two retire from the Avengers to pursue a new life together in Oxford.

====Beyond!====
Janet van Dyne is pulled into space and placed in a situation where she is expected to fight to the death with other heroes and villains. Instead of following the wishes of the Stranger—who they thought to be the Beyonder—Janet falls into the leadership position for the group, giving tactical orders in battle and calling upon her years of experience with the Avengers to handle the threats thrown at them. After tension between her and her ex-husband, Janet explains to Medusa why she cannot reconcile with Hank Pym, despite an attempt to do so while in London. Upon learning that the Space Phantom has impersonated Spider-Man, Janet leads the group and keeps one of the team from being trapped in limbo.

====Civil War====

During the superhuman Civil War, Janet van Dyne is pro-registration and suggests that they push forward the fifty-state initiative to get things under control after Ragnarok (the cyborg clone of Thor) kills Bill Foster, an event which upsets her greatly. She also becomes the host of a pro-registration reality TV show called &quot;America&#x27;s Newest Superhero&quot;.

====Mighty Avengers====
Janet van Dyne is selected as a member of the Mighty Avengers by Carol Danvers and Tony Stark as part of the Fifty State Initiative. During its attempt to destroy humanity, she correctly determines that Ultron has taken over Iron Man&#x27;s body. When alien symbiotes attack New York, Janet uses a refined growth formula given to her by Hank Pym—who is actually a Skrull impostor—which allows her to shift to giant-size without side effects. During the beginning of the fight, she is briefly turned into a symbiote monster before a cure is created by Stark.

====Secret Invasion====

Janet van Dyne is among the Mighty Avengers who are fighting heroes from the Skrull ship. She is later seen with the rest of the Avengers heading to New York to confront the Skrulls. While fighting the Skrulls, the true purpose of the serum that the Skrull Hank Pym has given her is revealed. After Queen Veranke is thought to be dead, the Skrull imposter presses a button that makes Janet increase in size rapidly, as well as causes her to emit lethal amounts of black-purple energy. Janet realizes that the &quot;new&quot; particles Pym has given her are turning her into a bio-bomb, and she tries to flee the battlefield and take as many Skrulls with her as possible when she explodes. To save both the city and heroes, Thor uses the enchanted hammer Mjolnir to create a spatial warp to seemingly disperse Janet into nothingness. Thor is devastated by the act and vows to avenge her. Upon accepting Janet&#x27;s death, Hank Pym takes up his ex-wife&#x27;s role as the Wasp.

===2010s===
Following the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Janet was transported to the Microverse by Thor&#x27;s spatial warp. Using her Avengers communication card, she sends a signal that enables the Avengers to rescue her. In the process, they liberate the Microverse from its tyrannical leader, Gouzar.

Following a brief hiatus, Janet returns to the team as a member of the Avengers Unity Squad. In addition to serving on the roster, she privately funds the team to avoid the problems that would come with government sponsorship. During the events of &quot;Inhumanity&quot;, Janet returns to the Microverse to rescue a family who has been pulled there through a newly awakened Inhuman&#x27;s powers. There she confronts Gouzar once more, before returning to normal space. In the Avengers Unity Squad&#x27;s fight with the Horsemen of Death, the Wasp defeats both the resurrected Banshee and Sentry, using both her ability to grow to giant size as well as her ability to control insect life. After the team is defeated and the Earth destroyed, Wasp is the last surviving human and begins a romance with Havok (Alex Summers) with whom she has a daughter named Katie. Years later on Planet X, she is captured when she and Havok destroy a tachyon dam preventing time travel to their era. They are able to undo the destruction of Earth by forming an alliance with Kang and projecting their minds back into their past selves (physical time-travel still being impossible) but Kang takes their daughter to a place outside of time to &#x27;protect&#x27; her from the changes in history, Kang subsequently attempts to use Katie as a hostage to force Havok to stop attacking him when he tries to take the Celestial power for himself, departing with Katie as his prisoner. Although Alex is left disfigured after the battle, he and Janet remain together. They are contacted by Immortus informing them that Immortus can return their daughter to them if they take action at the right time and place to conceive her, but he also warns them about the imminent threat posed by the Red Skull.

After the Red Skull&#x27;s actions cause all heroes and villains present at his defeat to undergo a &#x27;moral inversion&#x27;, Alex attempts to argue for Janet&#x27;s life as the X-Men prepare to detonate a gene bomb that will destroy all non-mutants in the blast radius, but accepts the decision nevertheless. After Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast, Alex attempts to take credit for it, but Janet sees through the deception. Although the inversion is undone, the two separate for good when Alex is one of three characters (the other two being Iron Man and Sabretooth) to remain in their new state.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Wasp confronts Wolverine (X-23) and her clones called The Sisters when they try to steal an Ant-Man suit. Wolverine explains what they are doing, so Wasp agrees to shrink down and destroys the nanites in Zelda&#x27;s body. While Wasp and Wolverine made their way through Zelda&#x27;s body, Captain Mooney of Alchemax Genetics shows up and shoots Zelda causing Wasp and Wolverine to exit the body. The two of them knock out Captain Mooney.

Wasp later caught up with the Uncanny Avengers and confronted Ultron Pym after helping to fend off the monsters in the subway. When Wasp asked Ultron Pym about the recent events, she figured out that Ultron is in control of Hank when Ultron guessed wrong. The rest of the Uncanny Avengers were informed of this causing Cable to pressure Hank enough for Ultron to go on the attack and reveal his true self.

Janet was called by Tony Stark to help him analyze the brain waves of Jocasta, since they were based on Janet&#x27;s herself, after finding the data they went on a date and rekindled their past relationship after fending off malfunctioning robots attacking Stark Unlimited. Wasp later helps defeating The Controller after he took over the virtual reality eScape and empowered various criminals throughout the city, and also directly aids Iron Man in subduing the supervillain Sudurang. During the &quot;Ultron Agenda&quot; arc, Wasp and Iron Man are suddenly attacked by a fusion of Vision and Wonder Man created by Ultron, who is trying to kidnap her, while Iron Man fends off the fusion, Wasp is found and captured by a brain-washed Jarvis and is taken to Ultron&#x27;s base, who reveals to her he is now fused with her ex-husband Hank Pym. Ultron later has Jocasta captured as well and reveals he is planning to combine both Jan and Jocasta in the same body the same way he did with Pym, therefore creating his &quot;Perfect wife&quot;, he is found by Iron Man and Machine Man before he activates his procedure, and cause him to have a mental breakdown through continued taunting, Ultron activates his machine but both Jan and Jocasta are saved by Iron Man who is fused with his armor in the process, Dr. Shapiro finds a way to revert Iron Man&#x27;s condition but Ultron sends a miniature version on himself to infiltrate Iron Man&#x27;s body who&#x27;s engaged by Wasp, gaining enough time for Iron Man to expel everything from his body and return to normal. Wasp later helps fend off an enraged Ultron who&#x27;s trying to kill everyone with his army of machine-fused human army, Iron Man uses his newly developed technology to separate the robotic parts from the organic ones to stop Ultron&#x27;s army and scare him off. Janet tries to comfort Tony after he finds out he is actually an A.I. before he flies away.

Wasp later appears as a member of the Agents of Wakanda.

Wasp and Nadia were later attacked by Whirlwind who was hired by W.H.I.S.P.E.R. and the Creature from the Kosmos. They defeated Whirlwind who offered to tell them who hired him in exchange for protection. Whirlwind did not get protection as he was killed in his cell by a mysterious person.

Mayor Luke Cage dispatched Wasp to the Raft to investigate the murders there. When the dead bodies came back to life and attacked Wasp, she is saved by Whirlwind whose dead body is possessed by an artificial personality named Victor Shade. She plans to keep an eye on &quot;Victor&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Making use of the cellular implantation of sub-atomic Pym particles, the Wasp possesses the power to alter her physical size, causing her body&#x27;s mass to be shunted to or gained from an alternate dimension known as Kosmos. She is able to shrink to a minimum of several centimeters or grow to a maximum of several hundred feet. Smaller or larger sizes are possible but the exertion puts a strain on her body. Initially, these abilities stem from use of a Pym particle gas released from special capsules, and later biochemical augmentation by Henry Pym. Over time, however, her body absorbs enough particles to cause cellular mutation due to repeated exposure to Pym particles, allowing her to alter her size at will.

At miniature size, her strength level increases as her body&#x27;s mass is compacted. At giant size, her strength and endurance increase geometrically with her height, reaching superhuman levels.

At miniature size, the Wasp grows a pair of translucent insect wings from her back, a result of genetic modifications provided by Hank Pym. These grant her the power of flight, at speeds up to .

The Wasp is able to harness and augment her body&#x27;s natural bio-electric energy, releasing it from her hands in powerful electrical force bursts, which she calls her &quot;stinger blasts&quot;, &quot;stingers&quot;, or &quot;wasp&#x27;s stings&quot;. Originally, she requires special wrist devices to produce these, but again, Pym particle absorption allows her to create the ability unaided.

The Wasp&#x27;s genetic modifications also grant her the ability to sprout small prehensile antennae from her temples which allowed her to telepathically communicate with and control insects. However, this is an ability she rarely uses.

Van Dyne displays several non-superhuman abilities that garner her special fame and attention, foremost of which is her fashion sense; in nearly all of her early appearances, she sports a new costume, presumably designed and manufactured on her own as she is a gifted fashion designer. She is also a skilled amateur screenwriter. The Wasp is trained in unarmed combat by Captain America and in combat using her special powers by Henry Pym. In addition, the Wasp is one of the most intuitive, if not deductive, members of the Avengers, and is an experienced leader and strategist. She effectively determines that a chemical accident has created a schizophrenic break in Henry and that the relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the Vision is the result of the infused personality of Wonder Man, and guesses Iron Man&#x27;s identity of Tony Stark.

==Critical reception==
George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; referred to the Wasp as one of the &quot;best female superheroes,&quot; writing, &quot;Though she started as something of a sidekick to her on-again-off-again (currently off-again) paramour Hank Pym, Janet quickly became a hero in her own right, leading the Avengers several times, and often acting as the team&#x27;s moral center. Wasp&#x27;s arc has consistently projected upwards, quickly leaving behind any semblance of being a &#x27;damsel in distress,&#x27; and progressing to the top levels of Marvel&#x27;s heroic roster. Add to that her historical significance, and it&#x27;s easy to see why she&#x27;s one of the greatest female heroes ever to grace the printed page.&quot; Rob Bricken of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; asserted, &quot;If Captain America epitomizes the Avengers, Janet Van Dyne is still its heart and soul. She was a founding member, has led the team through some of its most difficult moments, and has the unequivocal respect of gods, robots, and the most powerful beings in the cosmos. Marvel actually put it best when it said if the Avengers were asked to rank themselves, The Wasp would likely be #1.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; stated, &quot;Superhero comics were still lacking for strong female characters in the mid &#x27;60s. The Wasp was one of the ladies at the forefront of the feminist superhero movement. At first merely a bubbly sidekick to her husband, Giant-Man, Wasp quickly grew and built a career of her own. She remained one of the core Avengers members for much of the franchise&#x27;s history, and her extensive wardrobe rivals even the likes of Wolverine&#x27;s.&quot;

==Other characters named Wasp==

It was revealed that Hank Pym had a daughter named Nadia through Maria Trovaya who was abducted and supposedly killed by foreign agents. This caused Nadia to be raised in the Red Room until the day she obtained a Pym Particle sample that enabled her to escape.

It is later stated the Maker ruined Hank Pym&#x27;s experiments with Pym Particles, which left him with brain damage enough that he doesn&#x27;t remember doing them or the occurring of his impairing. Hank and Janet operate a extermination service as a couple where they deal with an infestation at a Hoboken restaurant. They find a family of Moloids as they recommend to its owner to enlist a relocation service for them. Afterwards, they are confronted by the Ultimates. They assume the alias of Giant-Man and Wasp when the Ultimates are attacked by Henri Duggary of Maker&#x27;s Council and his army. Both of them join the Ultimates afterwards.

Wasp later accompanied Iron Lad, Captain America, and Giant-Man in attacking the White House to confront a follower of Maker&#x27;s Council named Midas. After Giant-Man is knocked out upon everyone falling through the floor, Wasp dragged his unconscious body away.

<text>The Inland Northwest, historically and alternatively known as the Inland Empire, is a region of the American Northwest centered on the Greater Spokane, Washington Area, encompassing all of Eastern Washington and North Idaho. Under broader definitions, Northeastern Oregon and Western Montana may be included in the Inland Northwest. Alternatively, stricter definitions may exclude Central Washington and Idaho County, Idaho.

The phrase Inland Empire was first used by the Spokane Falls Review newspaper of Spokane Falls, Washington Territory (today’s Spokane, Washington) in its first issue on May 19, 1883.

, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the combined population of eastern Washington and north Idaho alone to be 2,240,645, comparable to that of New Mexico. Its Canadian counterpart, north of the border, is the British Columbia Interior, which together comprise the inland portion of the broader Pacific Northwest. Significant urban centers include the Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene area and the Tri-Cities.

There have been several proposals to politically unite the Inland Northwest. In the mid and late 1860s, there was a proposal centered on Lewiston in northern Idaho for a Columbia Territory to be formed in the region from parts of what is now eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana. In 1901, another proposal was made, this time to combine the Idaho Panhandle with Eastern Washington to create the State of Lincoln. A third proposal was popularized in the late 1920s to consist of eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana to the Continental Divide.

== Counties ==

;Washington: Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, and Yakima
;Idaho: Benewah, Bonner, Boundary, Clearwater, Idaho, Kootenai, Latah, Lewis, Nez Perce, and Shoshone

Oregon (often included)
: Morrow, Umatilla, Union, and Wallowa

Montana (sometimes included; never included as part of the Inland Empire)
: Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders

== Geography ==
The region is bounded by the Cascade Mountains on the west and the Rocky Mountains (following the spine of the remote and rugged Cabinet Mountains) on the east, the Blue Mountains of Oregon and foothills of the Wallowa Mountains to the south, southeast, and encompasses the Columbia river basin (or Columbia Plateau). Between the three mountain ranges are large, sweeping areas of semi-arid steppe, part of which has been irrigated due to the Columbia Basin Project, resulting in expansive farmland in central Washington. The Palouse, original home of the Appaloosa, is another major agricultural region located in the gently rolling hills of southeastern Washington and extending into Idaho. In northern Idaho, the precipitation from the Pacific Ocean over the North Central Rockies forests, create the North American inland temperate rainforest. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains of this range is noted for its natural resource wealth, particularly the Silver Valley with its mining heritage dating back to the 1880s.

Spokane, the region&#x27;s largest city, is located near where the arid, and largely unforested Columbia plateau meets the lush forests of the Selkirk Mountains. The urban area stretches east into Idaho along the I-90 corridor through the Spokane River valley. Across the border in Idaho the suburbs stretch into the cities of Post Falls and Coeur d&#x27;Alene on the north shore of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The Northeastern Washington and North Idaho portion of the Inland Empire are mountainous and forested, and the crest of the Bitterroot Range of the Rocky Mountains forms part of the eastern boundary of the Inland Empire region, while the Columbia River forms a significant part of its southern boundary.

=== Climate ===
The Washington side is generally semi-arid, while the Idaho side experiences a mostly dry summer continental climate.



== Demographics ==
===Population Centers===
The Inland Northwest is home to seven Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), eight if Western Montana is included, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. The two largest centers of population are formed out of multiple neighboring MSAs that are classified as Combined Statistical Areas. The largest in the region is the conurbation formed by the Spokane and Coeur d&#x27;Alene MSAs, the Spokane-Coeur d&#x27;Alene combined statistical area, which ranks 70th in the nation. The second largest center is the Kennewick-Richland-Walla Walla combined statistical area, which is made up of the Tri-Cities and Walla Walla and ranks as the 103rd largest in the nation.

==Economy==
Agriculture dominates the economy across large swaths of the region. The Palouse is a major producer of wheat and lentils. The Columbia Basin Project opened up 670,000 acres of the Columbia Plateau to irrigated farming. The Yakima Valley is the nation&#x27;s leading grower of hops as well as a major wine producing region. Washington is second to only California nationally in terms of wine production, with Eastern Washington being home to 19 of the state&#x27;s 20 recognized American Viticultural Areas.

==Culture==
===Arts and theater===
In Spokane, the Davenport Arts District has the largest concentration of art galleries and is home to many of Spokane&#x27;s main performing arts venues, including the Knitting Factory, Fox Theater, and Bing Crosby Theater. The Knitting Factory is a concert house that serves as a setting for many mainstream touring musicians and acts. The Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox, restored to its original 1931 Art Deco state after years of being derelict, is home to the Spokane Symphony Orchestra. The Metropolitan Performing Arts Center was restored in 1988 and renamed the Bing Crosby Theater in 2006 to honor the former Spokanite. Touring stand-up comedians are hosted by the Spokane Comedy Club. Theater is provided by Spokane&#x27;s only resident professional company, The Modern Theater, though there are also the Spokane Civic Theatre and several other amateur community theaters and smaller groups. The First Interstate Center for the Arts often hosts large traveling exhibitions, shows, and tours. 

In the Tri-Cities, the Richland Players Theater has offered live performances annually for over 70 years. Originally known as The Village Players, the theater group was created in 1944 to bring music, comedy, and cultural opportunities to the local community. Today, the theater has more than 7,500 attendees annually attracting audiences from across the region such as Spokane, Yakima, and Walla Walla. The theater also serves the local community by bringing local retirees to shows and accommodating the visually and hearing impaired (with the participation of non-profit United Blind).

===Sports===
The Inland Northwest is home to the Spokane Indians and Tri-City Dust Devils, professional teams in Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Northwest League; the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Spokane Chiefs and Tri-City Americans; and the Spokane Velocity and Spokane Zephyr teams in soccer.

==Media==
The Spokane area is served by The Spokesman-Review, a daily newspaper, as well as the Inlander, an alternative weekly, and the bi-weekly Spokane Journal of Business. Spokane is the 73rd largest TV market in the nation according to Nielsen. KREM carries CBS on channel 2, KXLY carries ABC on channel 4, KHQ carries NBC on channel 6 and KAYU carries FOX on channel 28.

The Tri-Cities is served by the Tri-City Herald, a daily newspaper. Yakima is served by the Yakima Herald-Republic, a daily newspaper. The Tri-Cities and Yakima are considered one media market by Nielsen, the 122nd largest in the country. KNDU carries NBC, KVEW carries ABC, KEPR carries CBS and KFFX carries Fox.

<text>Pope Sisinnius (died 4 February 708) was the bishop of Rome from 15 January 708 to his death on 4 February. Besides being Syrian and his father being named John, little is known of Sisinnius&#x27; early life or career. At the time of his election to the papal throne, Sisinnius suffered from severe gout, leaving him weak. During the course of his twenty-day papacy, Sisinnius consecrated a bishop for Corsica and ordered the reinforcement of the walls surrounding the papal capital of Rome. On his death, Sisinnius was buried in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He was succeeded by Pope Constantine.

==Background==
===Religious===

In the late fifth century, the churches of the East and West were divided over the monophysite controversy, the East largely accepting that Jesus Christ&#x27;s divine nature overshadowed his human nature, and the West (under the guidance of the 451 Council of Chalcedon) believing in a hypostatic union. The Eastern Byzantine emperors sought a theological compromise to hold their domains together, but the popes in Rome (the papal capital) suspected them of harboring heretical sympathies and accordingly attempted to resist imperial claims of dominance over the Church. By the time of Pope Martin I (), East–West relations had become incredibly strained; by the late seventh century, as the historian Eamon Duffy describes, &quot;[t]he requirement that the pope[s] should wait for confirmation of their appointment from Constantinople before they could be considered was waived, the Exarch at Ravenna [the Byzantine representative in the Italian Peninsula] being empowered to issue the necessary mandate&quot;.

The role of the pope in the time of Sisinnius, and the first millennium as a whole, was limited to that of a mediator. As the theologian Richard McBrien explains, the popes were not able to appoint all bishops, nor were they able to &quot;govern the universal Church&quot;. They also did not publish encyclicals or catechisms, and were not able to canonize saints or convene ecumenical councils.

===Political===

The centuries preceding the reign of Sisinnius were characterized by external intervention in the selection of the pope. The eastern Byzantine Empire nominated men of the Roman aristocracy to the office; the Italian Ostrogothic kingdom chose members of the provincial aristocracy. As the historian Jeffrey Richards explains, &quot;[t]he reasons for this are both political and social&quot;. The monarchs of both states relied on the support of the groups they installed on the papal throne. The seventh century saw a shift in the geographical origins of the popes: only eight out of twenty-seven popes between 604 and 752 were Roman, compared to the figure of eleven out of seventeen from 483 to 604. The change has its origins in the restoration of Byzantine dominion over Italy under Justinian I (), which saw the phasing out of the Roman senate as an institution as senatorial families were either executed or fled to the East. During the Ostrogothic kingdom&#x27;s rule over Rome from the late-fifth to the mid-sixth century, the senate held major sway over the selection of new popes, but following the imperial reconquest, control over the papal throne was no longer in its hands. Instead, the election of the pope was left to the clergy of Rome, the city&#x27;s people, and the Imperial military garrison. Richards argues that before the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and after the rise of the Holy Roman Empire in Italy in 752, the &quot;prestige, power and influence&quot; of the pope was augmented under the protection of the imperial powers, and notes the papacy&#x27;s growth in power during the sixth and seventh centuries.

Sisinnius&#x27; predecessor, John VII () was installed as the bishop of Rome the same year that the Byzantine emperor Justinian II () was restored to his throne. Shortly after regaining power, the latter sent several decrees of canon law from the 692 Quinisext Council to John, any of which he could approve or reject. Out of worry of displeasing the Emperor, the Pope sent the decrees back to Justinian unchanged. The issue of the Quinisext canons continued into the reign of Sisinnius&#x27; successor, Constantine, who travelled to Constantinople in 711 to negotiate with the East over the matter.

==Life and papacy==

Little information about Sisinnius before his election to the papal throne is extant. Much of what is known about him is deduced from four lines of the (), a collection of papal biographies. The historian Jean Durliat stated that &quot;[t]he concision of his biography may be interpreted as the result of aversion to him on the part of the Roman clergy, or perhaps a reflection of the absence of anomaly in an ecclesiastical career that led naturally to the pontificate&quot;. By birth, Sisinnius was Syrian and his father was named John. Sisinnius was respected for his upright, moral disposition and concern for the people of Rome, politically and militarily part of the Exarchate of Ravenna. Like many of his immediate predecessors, he was likely not a member of the upper class, as indicated by the paucity of donations of gold and silver during his pontificate and the pontificates of the popes between him and Pope Honorius I in the seventh century.

Sisinnius was elected to become the bishop of Rome, likely in October 707, and was consecrated on 15 January 708; the nearly three-month delay was due to a wait for confirmation of Sisinnius&#x27; election by the exarch of Ravenna. By the time of his election, Sisinnius was ridden with gout and could not feed himself using his hands. He was one of many such early medieval popes who were elderly, which Richards explains by saying that &quot;[o]ld age in the popes generally also betokened experience&quot; in either administrative or spiritual tasks, which the electorate would have taken into consideration when choosing a new pope. During his reign, Sisinnius consecrated a bishop for Corsica. He also ordered the preparation of lime so that the walls surrounding the city of Rome, which by then were in poor condition due to past attacks, could be reinforced. The task was never executed, as Sisinnius died in Rome on 4 February after a reign of twenty days. He was buried in the left nave of Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica; his tomb was destroyed in the 17th century during the Basilica&#x27;s demolition. The next pope elected was Constantine, another Syrian, who was consecrated on 25 March 708.

<text>Mario Savio (December 8, 1942 – November 6, 1996) was an American activist and a key member of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. He is most famous for his passionate speeches, especially the &quot;Bodies Upon the Gears&quot; address given at Sproul Hall, University of California, Berkeley on December 2, 1964.

Savio remains historically relevant as an icon of the earliest phase of the 1960s counterculture movement.

==Early life==
Savio was born in New York City to a Sicilian-born Italian-American father who designed and manufactured restaurant equipment. Savio&#x27;s mother was from Veneto, born in the US, and worked in retail sales. Both his parents were devout Catholics and, as an altar boy, Savio planned to become a priest.

He graduated from Martin Van Buren High School in Queens at the top of his class in 1960. He went to Manhattan College on a full scholarship, and to Queens College. When he finished in 1963, he spent the summer working with a Catholic relief organization in Taxco, Mexico helping to improve the sanitary problems by building facilities in the slums.

His parents had moved to Los Angeles and in late 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. In March 1964, he was arrested while demonstrating against the San Francisco Hotel Association for excluding Black people from non-menial jobs. He was charged with trespassing, along with 167 other protesters. While in jail, a cellmate asked if he was heading for Mississippi that summer to help with the Civil Rights project.

==Activism==
In mid-1964, he joined the Freedom Summer projects in Mississippi and was involved in helping African Americans register to vote. He also taught at a freedom school for Black children in McComb, Mississippi. In July, Savio, another white civil-rights activist and a Black acquaintance were walking down a road in Jackson and were attacked by two men. They filed a police report where the FBI became involved. However, the case stalled until President Lyndon Johnson, who had recently signed the Civil Rights Act, allowed the FBI to look into it as a civil-rights violation. Eventually one of the attackers was found, charged with misdemeanor assault and fined $50.

After Savio participated in these protests, he was inspired to fight further against the violence he had witnessed. He came to see the violence and racism of the American South as the visible facet of an overall structure of nationwide socioeconomic hegemony. When Savio returned to Berkeley after his time in Mississippi, he intended to raise money for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, but found that the university had banned all political activity and fundraising. He told Karlyn Barker in 1964 that it was a question as to whose side one was on. &quot;Are we on the side of the civil rights movement? Or have we gotten back to the comfort and security of Berkeley, California, and can we forget the sharecroppers whom we worked with just a few weeks back? Well, we couldn&#x27;t forget.&quot;

Savio&#x27;s part in the protest on the Berkeley campus started on October 1, 1964, when former graduate student Jack Weinberg was staffing a table for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Weinberg was arrested when he refused to provide identification. The university police had just put him into a police car when someone from the surrounding crowd yelled, &quot;We can all see better if we sit down.&quot; Soon those in front of and behind the police car starting sitting as the call &quot;sit down&quot; echoed through the crowd, trapping the car in the plaza. Savio, along with others during the 32-hour sit-in, climbed on top of the police car (after taking off his shoes, to avoid scratching the paint on the car), and spoke with words that roused the crowd into a frenzy.

The last time he climbed on the police car was to tell the crowd of a short-term understanding that had been reached with UC President Clark Kerr. Savio said to the crowd, &quot;I ask you to rise quietly and with dignity and go home.&quot; Savio became the prominent leader of the newly formed Free Speech Movement. Negotiations failed to change the situation; therefore direct action began in Sproul Hall on December 2. There, Savio gave his most famous speech, &quot;Bodies Upon the Gears,&quot; in front of 4,000 people. He and 800 others were arrested that day. In 1967, he was sentenced to 120 days at Santa Rita Jail. He told reporters that he &quot;would do it again.&quot;

In April 1965, he quit the FSM because &quot;he was disappointed with the growing gap between the leadership of the FSM ... and the students themselves.&quot;

===&quot;Bodies Upon the Gears&quot; speech===
Also known as &quot;Operation of the Machine&quot;, this speech is possibly Savio&#x27;s best-known work. He spoke on the steps of Sproul Hall, on December 2, 1964:

===FBI surveillance===
In 1999, the media revealed that Savio had been tailed by the FBI from the moment that he had climbed onto the police car in which Jack Weinberg was detained. He was followed for more than a decade because he had emerged as the nation&#x27;s most prominent student leader. There was no evidence that he was a threat or that he had any connection with the Communist Party, but the FBI decided he merited their attention because they thought he could inspire students to rebel.

Even after he had left the FSM, the FBI called him to their Berkeley office. They told Savio that they had received letters of a threatening nature towards him, but they would not speak while Savio&#x27;s attorney was present. However, Savio would not agree to being alone with the agents, and instead criticized the FBI &quot;for failure to make arrests and take action in the South where human rights are being violated every day&quot;. At this point, the meeting ended.

According to hundreds of pages of FBI files, the bureau:

*Collected, without court order, personal information about Savio from schools, telephone companies, utility firms, and banks and compiled information about his marriage and divorce.
*Monitored his day-to-day activities by using informants planted in political groups, covertly contacting his neighbors, landlords and employers, and having agents pose as professors, journalists, and activists to interview him and his wife.
*Obtained his tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service in violation of federal rules, mischaracterized him as a threat to the president and arranged for the CIA and foreign intelligence agencies to investigate him when he and his family traveled in Europe.
*Put him on an unauthorized list of people to be detained without judicial warrant in the event of a national emergency and designated him as a &quot;Key Activist&quot; whose political activities should be &quot;disrupted&quot; and &quot;neutralized&quot; under the bureau&#x27;s illegal counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO.

The FBI&#x27;s Savio investigation finally ended at the beginning of 1975, when an investigation into the FBI&#x27;s abuse of power began. Savio&#x27;s ex-wife, Suzanne Goldberg, said that the &quot;FBI&#x27;s investigation of her and Savio [was] a waste of money and an invasion of privacy&quot;.

==Physics, teaching career, and death==
Between 1965 and his death, Savio held a variety of jobs, including as a salesclerk in Berkeley and instructor at Sonoma State University. In 1965, he married Suzanne Goldberg, whom he had met in the Free Speech Movement. Two months after their wedding, they moved to England because Savio won a scholarship to the University of Oxford. While there, they had their first child, Stefan. Savio did not complete his degree at Oxford, and they moved back to California in February 1966. In 1968, he ran for state senator from Alameda County on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, but lost to Nicholas C. Petris, a liberal Democrat. In April 1970, the Savios had their second son, Nadav, but filed for divorce soon after (April 1972), citing irreconcilable differences. After that, he entered a period of severe emotional troubles. According to his friend Jackie Goldberg (a former FSM leader, and not related to his wife), Savio showed up homeless on her doorstep, and she found him in a &quot;very bad emotional state.&quot; Savio was suffering from depression, and in February 1973 the FBI was told he had been hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center.

In 1980, he married a second time, to Lynne Hollander, an old acquaintance from the Free Speech Movement. He returned to study at San Francisco State University soon thereafter. In 1984, he received a summa cum laude bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics and earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1989. Savio was a good student and had a theorem named after him by a professor. In 1990, Savio and Hollander moved with their ten-year-old son to Sonoma County, California, where Savio taught mathematics, philosophy, and logic at Sonoma State University. Although Savio generally kept a low profile on campus, he joined students to protest a rise in student fees.

Savio had a history of heart problems and the day following a bitter and extended public debate with Sonoma State University&#x27;s then-president, Ruben Armiñana, Savio had a heart attack. He was admitted to Columbia-Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, California, on November 2, 1996. He slipped into a coma on November 5 and died the following day, shortly after being removed from life support.

==Legacy==
A Memorial Lecture Fund was set up to honor Mario Savio upon his death. The Mario Savio Memorial Lecture Fund hosts an annual lecture on the University of California, Berkeley campus. Past lecturers include Howard Zinn, Winona LaDuke, Lani Guinier, Barbara Ehrenreich, Arlie Russell Hochschild, Cornel West, Christopher Hitchens, Adam Hochschild, Amy Goodman, Molly Ivins, Jeff Chang, Tom Hayden, Angela Davis, Seymour Hersh, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Naomi Klein, Elizabeth Warren, Robert Reich, and Van Jones.

The Memorial Fund also set up the Mario Savio Young Activist Award to honor an outstanding young activist with a deep commitment to human rights and social justice and the qualities of leadership ability, creativity, and integrity.

In 1997, the steps of Sproul Plaza, from which he had given his most famous speech, were officially renamed the &quot;Mario Savio Steps&quot;. The Free Speech Movement Cafe on the Berkeley campus honors him.

On March 12, 2011, at the end of an announcement by hacktivist group Anonymous of an attack, called the Empire State Rebellion, on the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of International Settlements and the World Bank, an excerpt of Savio&#x27;s speech was included. Since the onset of the Occupy movement in the United States in late 2011, Savio&#x27;s speech and his activism have been cited many times.

On October 16, 2012, the Sebastopol City Council rededicated the Downtown Plaza as the &quot;Mario Savio Free Speech Plaza&quot;. On November 15, 2012, the &quot;Mario Savio Speakers&#x27; Corner&quot; was dedicated on the campus of Sonoma State University. At the ceremony, Lynne Hollander Savio told the audience, &quot;I hope you will use this free speech corner often, to advocate and organize with dignity and responsibility for the causes you believe in.&quot;

Footage of Mario Savio is prominently featured in the 1990 documentary film &quot;Berkeley in the Sixties&quot;.

<text>Wasps in the family Pompilidae are commonly called spider wasps, spider-hunting wasps, or pompilid wasps. The family is cosmopolitan, with some 5,000 species in six subfamilies. Nearly all species are solitary (with the exception of some group-nesting Ageniellini), and most capture and paralyze prey, though members of the subfamily Ceropalinae are kleptoparasites of other pompilids, or ectoparasitoids of living spiders.

In South America, species may be referred to colloquially as or , though these names can be generally applied to any very large stinging wasps. Furthermore, in some parts of Venezuela and Colombia, it is called , or &quot;horse killers&quot;, while in Brazil some particular bigger and brighter species of the general kind might be called /, or &quot;throat locker&quot;.

== Morphology ==
Like other strong fliers, pompilids have a thorax modified for efficient flight. The metathorax is solidly fused to the pronotum and mesothorax; moreover, the prothorax is best developed in Pompilidae and Scoliidae because wasps in these families use their forelegs to dig.
Pompilids typically have long, spiny legs; the hind femur is often long enough to reach past the tip of the abdomen. The tibiae of the rear legs usually have a conspicuous spine at their distal end. The first two segments of the abdomen are narrow, giving the body a slender look. The pompilid body is typically dark (black or blue, sometimes with metallic reflections), but many brightly colored species exist. From a lateral view, its pronotum looks rectangular and it extends back to the tegulae, near the base of the wings. Most species are macropterous (having long wings), but a few brachypterous (short-winged) and apterous (no wings) species are known.

Spider wasps are best distinguished from other vespoid wasps in having (in most species) a transverse groove bisecting the mesopleuron (the mesepisternal sclerite, a region on the side of middle segment of the thorax above the point where the legs join). They have antennae with 10 flagellomeres in females and 11 in males. Most Pompilidae have straight inner eye margins. The hind wings do not have a distinct claval lobe, but they have a distinctive jugal lobe. The hind leg has a tibial spur with a tuft or row of fine hairs. The legs are long and slender with the tips of the tibia (metatibia) long enough to extend beyond the tip of the abdomen (metasoma). Sexual dimorphism is not pronounced, although females are often larger than the males. Coloration and wing appearance vary greatly among the many species. General coloration is aposematic (warning off predators), generally based on black, often with markings of orange, red, yellow, or white. Larvae can also be identified by physical examination.

== Systematics ==
The Pompilidae have in the past been split into either 4 or 6 subfamilies. However, Pitts, Wasbauer &amp; Von Dohlen (2005) found that Notocyphinae was nested within the Pompilinae, while Epipompilinae was nested within the Ctenocerinae. This left 4 subfamilies as monophyletic clades, with Ceropalinae being the most basal subfamily and Pepsinae being the sister clade to the more derived Ctenocerinae and Pompilinae. Waichert et al (2015) resurrected the Notocyphinae as a subfamily, to have 5 subfamilies within Pompilidae. In this classification Ctenocerinae were found to be the basal group; Pepsinae and Notocyphinae were sister taxa, as were Pepsinae and Pompilinae. They placed the genus &quot;Epipompilus&quot; in the Pepsinae.

The subfamilies according to Waichert et al are:

*Ceropalinae containing 2 genera, &quot;Ceropales&quot; and &quot;Irenangelus&quot;
*Notocyphinae containing a single genus, &quot;Notocyphus&quot;, distributed in both the Nearctic and Neotropics
*Ctenocerinae containing 26 genera, including 2 genera in the Neotropics, 4 in Australia and 11 in Africa
*Pepsinae a diverse subfamily containing 84 genera, distributed worldwide except for Antarctica
*Pompilinae a diverse subfamily containing 107 genera, distributed worldwide except for Antarctica

== Evolution ==
The oldest fossil currently known is an indeterminate fossil from the Early Eocene (Ypresian) Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington State, USA. Other fossil species are known from Dominican and Baltic ambers, the Florissant Formation and various other localities in Germany, France and Spain. &quot;Bryopompilus&quot; described from the mid Cretaceous Burmese amber was initially thought to belong to this family; however, it was subsequently placed in its own family, the Bryopompilidae.

== Ecology and behavior ==
Unlike many other families in the Aculeata, essentially all wasps in this family are solitary (nests made by a single female).

Adult pompilids are nectar-feeding insects and feed on a variety of plants. Depending on genus and species, pompilids capture a variety of spiders for their larvae to feed on, covering nearly all free-living spider families, including tarantulas, wolf spiders (Lycosidae), huntsman spiders (Sparassidae), jumping spiders (Salticidae) and baboon spiders (Harpactirinae), though any given pompilid tends to attack only a limited diversity of spiders.

A female wasp searches the ground and/or vegetation for a spider, and upon finding one, stings it, paralyzing the spider. The targeted spider is typically unable to kill the wasp, because the wasp can just fly out of reach, so at best the spider fights fiercely to escape. Tarantula hawks (Pepsini) do not attack when adult tarantulas are close to or in their burrows. Instead, the wasps seek out adult males who have left their burrows in search of females to mate with. In the open the wasp first uses its wings to beat air over the tarantula, deceiving the tarantula into thinking that it is being targeted by a large bird so the tarantula reacts by curling up to appear smaller and less noticeable, which in turn makes the tarantula defenseless against the wasp&#x27;s attack. However, Brazilian Wandering spiders (&quot;Phoneutria&quot;) and their predators have a different interaction dynamic, and the spiders often manage to defeat the hunting wasp.

Once the spider is paralyzed, a female pompilid digs a burrow or flies or drags the spider to a previously made burrow. Because of the large body size of their prey, tarantula hawks usually will either construct burrows near the site of attack or use the host&#x27;s own burrow or tunnel. Pompilids typically provide each of their larvae with a single prey/host, which must be large enough to serve as its food source throughout its development. Typically, a single egg is laid on the abdomen of the spider, and the nest or burrow is closed so the larva can develop without disruption by other parasites or scavengers. The female wasp may then engage in spreading soil or other changes to the area, leaving the nest site inconspicuous. One species of spider wasp protects its nests by putting dead ants into the outermost chamber, where the ants&#x27; chemicals deter predators.
The egg hatches and the larva feeds on the spider, breaking through the integument with its mandibles. As the larva feeds on its host, it saves the vital organs, such as the heart and central nervous system, for last. By waiting until the final larval instar, it ensures the spider will not decompose before the larva has fully developed. The larva has five instar stages before it pupates; no major morphological differences are noted between the first four instars, with the exception of size. At the conclusion of the final instar, the larva spins a durable silk cocoon, and emerges as an adult either later in the same season or overwinters, depending on the species and the time of year the larva pupates. Some ceropalines lay their egg on a still-active spider, only temporarily paralyzing it, and the wasp larva feeds externally by extracting hemolymph after the egg hatches. In time, the spider will die, and the mature wasp larva will then pupate.

The size of the host can influence whether the wasp&#x27;s egg will develop as a male or a female; larger prey often yield the (larger) females.
&quot;Pepsis thisbe&quot; of the southwestern United States exhibits a direct correlation between adult wasp body length and the weight of its host spider, &quot;Aphonopelma echina&quot;. Because the size of a &quot;P. thisbe&quot; adult is determined by the size of the host provided for it by its mother, the seasonal frequency of host sizes implicitly will determine the size variation in adult wasps.

In another study on &quot;Pepsis thisbe&quot;, chemosensory cues were shown to be used to detect specific hosts. Specific chemosensory cues attract the wasp to its prey, &quot;Aphonopelma echina&quot;, despite other host spiders of the same size and frequency being present. In studies on &quot;Pepsis grossa&quot; (formerly &quot;P. formosa&quot;), a pompilid of the southwestern United States, the wasps were found to have behavioral plasticity. Their hunting behavior concerning their host &quot;Rhechostica echina&quot; improved with experience. The time required to complete all behavioral components decreased with each spider killed.

Concerning mating behavior, males acquire perch territories to scan for incoming receptive females. In studies on the tarantula wasp &quot;Hemipepsis ustulata&quot;, larger males are more likely to acquire perch territories and territorial males appear to increase their chances of mating because receptive females fly to perch sites held by said males.


== Sting ==

=== Toxins ===

The Pompilidae produce a venom, delivered when they sting, containing a variety of powerful neurotoxins named pompilidotoxin (PMTX). These inhibit the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, causing too much sodium to flow through neuron cell membranes, causing long bursts of nerve impulses (action potentials), and thus overstimulating these nerves. Alpha- and beta-PMTX are both small peptide chains of just 13 amino acids; alpha-PMTX has been studied in &quot;Anoplius samariensis&quot;, while beta-PMTX has been studied in &quot;Batozonellus maculifrons&quot;.

=== Schmidt pain index ===
In 1984, Justin O. Schmidt developed a hymenopteran sting pain scale, now known as the Schmidt sting pain index. In this index, a 0 is given to a sting from an insect that cannot break through human skin, a 2 is given for intermediate pain, and a 4 is given for intense pain. The scale rates stings from 78 different species in 42 different genera. The species &quot;Pepsis grossa&quot;, one of the species of tarantula hawk, has a sting rating of 4. The sting is described as &quot;blinding, fierce, and shockingly electric. A running hair dryer has been dropped into your bubble bath.&quot;

<doc id="439665" wikidata="Q313964" url="?curid=439665" title="Antipope Christopher">
<text>Christopher claimed the papacy from October 903 to January 904. Although he was listed as a legitimate pope in most modern lists of popes until the first half of the 20th century, the apparently uncanonical method by which he obtained the papacy led to his being removed from the quasi-official roster of popes, the &quot;Annuario Pontificio.&quot; As such, he is now considered an antipope by the Catholic Church.

==Life and reign==
Little is known about the life of Christopher; the lack of reliable, consistent sources makes it difficult to establish a concise biography. It is believed that he was a Roman, and that his father&#x27;s name was Leo. He was cardinal-priest of the title of St. Damasus when he became pope. His predecessor, Leo V, was deposed and imprisoned, most likely around October 903. As it is believed that Leo died in prison, Christopher may be regarded as pope after his death. However, the account of Auxilius of Naples says that Sergius III murdered both Leo V and Christopher. An eleventh-century Greek document says that Christopher was the first pope to state that the Holy Ghost proceeded &quot;from the Father and from the Son&quot;. However, the document claims that Christopher made this profession to Sergius, Patriarch of Constantinople. At that time, however, Nicholas Mystikos was Patriarch of Constantinople, making the account historically suspect. (Sergius I was Patriarch in 610–638, and Sergius II in 1001–1019.)
==Dethroning==
Christopher was driven from the antipapacy by Pope Sergius III (904–911). Hermannus Contractus contends that Christopher was compelled to end his days living as a monk. However, the historian Eugenius Vulgarius says he was strangled in prison.

==Legitimacy==
Some hold that Christopher was a legitimate pope, regardless of the illegitimate means by which he appears to have acquired the title. His name is included in all major catalogues of the popes through the early twentieth century. His portrait figures among the other likenesses of the popes in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome, and among the frescoes of tenth-century popes painted in the thirteenth century on the walls of the ancient church of San Pietro a Grado, outside Pisa. He was, moreover, acknowledged as pope by his successors. For example, in confirming the privileges of the Abbey of Corbie in France, Leo IX mentioned the preceding grants of Benedict and Christopher. This privilege is the only one of Christopher&#x27;s acts that is extant. However, he has not been considered a legitimate pope since the first half of the 20th century and has been erased from the &quot;Annuario pontificio&quot;″s list of popes.

<text>Poza Rica (), formally: Poza Rica de Hidalgo is a city and its surrounding municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Its name means &quot;rich well/pond&quot;. It is often thought that the name came to be because it was a place known for its abundance of oil. In reality, before oil was discovered, there existed a pond rich in fish, which gave origin to the city’s name. In the 20th century oil was discovered in the area. It has since been almost completely extracted. This has resulted in the decline of oil well exploration and drilling activities, though there are still many oil facilities. 

The city shares borders with the municipalities of Papantla, Tihuatlán, and Coatzintla, and stands on Federal Highway 180. The archaeological zone of El Tajín is located approximately from Poza Rica. The area is tropical, with two beaches within one hour, Tuxpan, and Tecolutla, and one within 40 minutes east, Cazones. Mexico City is about from Poza Rica.Unlike most Mexican cities, it does not have old buildings because it is a new city founded officially on November 20, 1951. For that reason it has contemporary architecture with well-lined and designed streets with a modern look.

While the petroleum industry features heavily amongst the industrial landscape in Poza Rica, the city also has a wide variety of other industries with a large middle class. As one of the largest and most populous cities in Veracruz, Poza Rica is an important industrial and commercial center, and a central hub for several road transportation lines.

The administrative boundaries of the municipality are determined by the municipality northeast of Papantla, south to the town of Coatzintla and to the northwest by the municipality of Tihuatlán, separated from the latter by the course of the river Cazones.
=== Geology and relief ===

The center of the city sits in a small valley on the basin river Cazones, in the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico, with an average altitude of 60 m, although most of the land sits on uneven ground and mostly hills northeast of the city, among which is the Cerro del Meson, with a maximum height of 242 meters. The predominant soils are of the vertisol type, with a high content of clay forming expansive cracks in dry seasons.

Since its inception, the rapid urban growth in extension exceeded the capacity of available flat land in the city, expanding the urban area to the northeast of the city, using increasingly uneven ground and hills bordering the town of Papantla, inhabiting the slopes of the hills that surround the city center.

=== Hydrography ===

The town of Poza Rica is located in the watershed of the river Cazones, this River 100 km long born in the mountainous region of Hidalgo and flows into the Gulf of Mexico, has a higher average annual runoff of 40 m3/s in its mouth. The city is also surrounded by several Cazones River tributary streams such as the Mollejón, Hueleque, Salsipuedes and Arroyo Corn, which is regularly affected by flooding the annual rainy season.

Mexico&#x27;s only nuclear power plant, Laguna Verde nuclear power plant, is about away, near the state&#x27;s capital city of Xalapa, Veracruz.
