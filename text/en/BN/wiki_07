<text>General Sir Henry George Chauvel, (16 April 1865 – 4 March 1945) was a senior officer of the Australian Imperial Force who fought at Gallipoli and during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. He was the first Australian to attain the rank of lieutenant general and later general, and the first to lead a corps. As commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, he was responsible for one of the most decisive victories and fastest pursuits in military history.

The son of a , Chauvel was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, a unit organised by his father, in 1886. After the family moved to Queensland he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry in 1890, and saw service during the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike. He became a regular officer in 1896, and went to the United Kingdom as part of the Queensland contingent for the 1897 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1899 he commanded one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that were Queensland&#x27;s initial contribution to the Boer War. After the war, he was closely involved with the training of the Australian Light Horse.

Promoted to colonel in 1913, Chauvel became the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff but the First World War broke out while he was still &quot;en route&quot; to the United Kingdom. Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt, where he joined his new command, the 1st Light Horse Brigade, in December. In May 1915, it was sent dismounted to Gallipoli, where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous parts of the line. He took charge of the 1st Division that November. In March 1916, Chauvel became commander of the Anzac Mounted Division, gaining victories in the Battle of Romani in August and the Battle of Magdhaba in December, and nearly winning the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917. The following month, he took over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps, and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general. At Beersheba in October 1917, his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history&#x27;s last great cavalry charges. By September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the enemy that won the Battle of Megiddo. He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history.

In 1919, Chauvel was appointed Inspector General, the Army&#x27;s most senior post. He was forced to maintain an increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure. He was concurrently Chief of the General Staff from 1923 until his retirement in 1930. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. During the Second World War, he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the Volunteer Defence Corps.

==Early life==
Henry George Chauvel was born in Tabulam, New South Wales, on 16 April 1865, the second child of a , Charles Henry Edward Chauvel, and his wife Fanny Ada Mary, née James. By 1884, Charles Henry Chauvel&#x27;s station at Tabulam consisted of , on which he raised 12,000 head of cattle and 320 horses. From an early age Henry George Chauvel was known as &quot;Harry&quot;. He was educated at Mr Belcher&#x27;s School near Goulburn, before going to Sydney Grammar School from 1874 to 1880, and Toowoomba Grammar School from 1881 to 1882. While at Sydney Grammar, Harry served in the school cadet unit, rising to the rank of lance corporal. In 1886, Charles Henry was given permission to raise two troops of cavalry. On 14 March 1886, he was commissioned as a captain in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, with his sons Arthur and Harry becoming second lieutenants, while his two younger sons became troopers. The unit escorted Lord Carrington, Governor of New South Wales, when he formally opened the railway at Tenterfield in 1886.

Following a series of severe droughts in northern New South Wales, Charles Henry Chauvel sold his property at Tabulam in 1888 for £50,000. After paying his debts, he bought a much smaller property at Canning Downs on the Darling Downs in Queensland. In 1889, Harry Chauvel embarked on a solo tour of Europe, visiting Venice, Rome, Florence, Paris and London. While in the United Kingdom, he watched military manoeuvres near Aldershot in the presence of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany. Harry resigned his commission in the New South Wales Military Forces when he moved to Queensland, but on 9 January 1890 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry. After completing his examinations for the rank, he was confirmed as lieutenant in June 1890.

Chauvel&#x27;s unit was called up in March 1891 during the shearers&#x27; strike that had begun earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small detachment of Queensland Police, Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of strikebreakers to a station north of Charleville. Near Oakwood, Chauvel&#x27;s troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted sheep shearers. When the inspector in charge of the police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers&#x27; strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in Clermont, and later the district around Longreach.

On 9 September 1896, Chauvel transferred to the Queensland Permanent Military Forces with the rank of captain in the Moreton Regiment. He was sent to the United Kingdom with the Queensland contingent for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Sporting the emu feathers worn by Queensland units, he marched with the colonial troops through London behind Lord Roberts on 21 June 1897. Chauvel qualified at the School of Musketry at Hythe, Kent, and served on exchange with the 3rd Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps and 2nd Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment at Aldershot. On returning to Australia, he became a staff officer at headquarters, Queensland Defence Force.

==Boer War==
In July 1899, the Premier of Queensland, James Dickson, offered a contingent of troops for service in South Africa in the event of war between the British Empire, and the Boer Transvaal Republic and Orange Free State. For a time Chauvel served as an enrolment officer, signing up volunteers from the Darling Downs. The Boer War broke out in October 1899, and Chauvel was given command of one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that departed Brisbane on 1 November 1899. They disembarked at Cape Town on 14 December and joined the Imperial force under Lord Methuen at the Orange River. The Queensland Mounted Infantry&#x27;s first fighting was in an action at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 alongside the infantry of the Royal Canadian Regiment. In February, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General John French&#x27;s Cavalry Division. After a strenuous march, the Cavalry Division relieved the siege of Kimberley on 15 February.

In the reorganisation that followed, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General Edward Hutton&#x27;s 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade, along with the Canadian and New Zealand mounted units. Chauvel distinguished himself fighting alongside a group of New Zealanders and capturing a Maxim gun. The Queensland Mounted Infantry participated in the capture of Pretoria and the Battle of Diamond Hill. Chauvel was given a mixed force of British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand mounted troops that became known as &quot;Chauvel&#x27;s Mounted Infantry&quot;, with Victor Sellheim as his chief of staff. Initially, Chauvel was given the mission of escorting 10,000 head of cattle to Belfast, Mpumalanga to supply the troops in the eastern Transvaal. However, his force was diverted by local commanders, who assigned it to burning homesteads sheltering Boer commandos and attacking Boer units. The Queensland Mounted Infantry embarked for Australia on 13 December 1900. They reached Brisbane on 17 January 1901 and the regiment was disbanded there on 23 January. For his part in the fighting, Chauvel was mentioned in dispatches, and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG).
On 1 January 1901, the colonies of Australia federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia. When Chauvel returned to Australia on 17 January, he found that during his absence he had become an officer in the newly formed Australian Army. A force of 14,000 troops was assembled for the opening of the first Federal Parliament on 9 May 1901 in Melbourne; Chauvel was selected as brigade major of the mounted contingent, his first Federal posting. He became Staff Officer, Northern Military District, based at Townsville, Queensland, in July. In 1902, Chauvel was appointed to command of the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse, a unit newly raised for service in South Africa, with the local rank of lieutenant colonel. Departing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902, the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse arrived at Durban on 22 June, three weeks after the war ended. It therefore re-embarked for Brisbane, where it was disbanded. Chauvel remained in South Africa for a few weeks in order to tour the battlefields. On returning to Australia he became Staff Officer, Northern Military District once more. He was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1902.

In 1903, Hutton, now General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces, sent Chauvel to South Australia to organise the light horse regiments there. On returning to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff in London was blocked by Hutton&#x27;s successor Major General Charles Hoad. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas on the nature of mounted infantry. He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation.

Chauvel knew Keith Jopp of Newmarket, Queensland even before the Boer War, and while stationed in Brisbane, Chauvel and Major Brudenell White played tennis at the Jopps&#x27; place with their daughters Dora and Sibyl. Chauvel became engaged to Sibyl in January 1906, and they were married on 16 June 1906 at All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane. Their union ultimately produced two sons and two daughters. That year Chauvel also sold the property at Canning Downs South. In the shuffle of senior positions that followed Hoad&#x27;s death in 1911, Chauvel was appointed to the Military Board in Melbourne as Adjutant General. As such, Chauvel was involved in the implementation of the Universal Training Scheme. Chauvel was particularly involved with the training of the light horse. &quot;When the next war comes,&quot; White predicted, &quot;it will only need an Ashby or a J.E.B. Stuart to make their name immortal.&quot;

==First World War==

===War Office===
Chauvel was promoted to colonel in 1913. On 3 July 1914, he sailed for England with his wife and three children to replace Colonel James Gordon Legge as the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff. While he was still travelling, the First World War broke out. On reporting for duty at the War Office in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) when it arrived in the United Kingdom. Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF&#x27;s proposed quarters on the Salisbury Plain. He made frequent visits to the site and had a Royal Australian Engineers officer, Major Cecil Henry Foott, appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests. Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time, and that Australian troops would therefore have to spend a winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas, Chauvel persuaded the High Commissioner for Australia in London, former Prime Minister Sir George Reid, to approach Lord Kitchener with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt, which was done. Accompanied by Major Thomas Blamey, Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the ocean liner on 28 November 1914, arriving at Port Said on 10 December 1914.

===Gallipoli===
Chauvel began training his brigade upon arrival in Egypt. He was noted for insisting on high standards of dress and bearing from his troops. The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General Alexander Godley&#x27;s New Zealand and Australian Division, along with the 4th Infantry Brigade, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. When the rest of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps departed for Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the mounted brigades remained in Egypt – the Gallipoli Peninsula being unsuited to mounted operations. Following heavy casualties in the early days of the Gallipoli Campaign, however, the light horse were called upon to provide 1,000 reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell, elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact.
Chauvel arrived on 12 May 1915 and took over the critical sector, which included Pope&#x27;s Hill and Quinn&#x27;s, Courtney&#x27;s and Steele&#x27;s Posts, from Colonel John Monash. Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts at the top of Monash Valley were the linchpin of the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts. He also formed special sniper groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley. Chauvel&#x27;s brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn&#x27;s Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Cannan was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major S. C. E. Herring was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel&#x27;s decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.

On 9 July 1915, Chauvel was promoted to brigadier general, back-dated to when he assumed command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade on 10 December 1914. He spent six weeks in Egypt, in June and July, in hospital with pleurisy, but returned in time for the August offensive, for which he was mentioned in despatches. Chauvel was acting commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division for short periods in September and October in Godley&#x27;s absence. Then on 6 November 1915, he became commander of the 1st Division, and was promoted to temporary major general. He commanded this division through the final phase of the Gallipoli campaign, the evacuation, and the reorganisation in Egypt in February and March 1916. For his part in the evacuation, he was mentioned in despatches. His role in the campaign as a whole was recognised by his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

===Sinai===

====Anzac Mounted Division====
Chauvel assumed command of the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it relieved the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches for his part in the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, the northern part of the Canal, under Major General Herbert Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel&#x27;s command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GOC Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.

For the Battle of Romani, Chauvel chose his ground carefully, reconnoitring it from the ground and the air, and selecting both forward and fall back positions. His luck held; the German commander – Friedrich Kreß von Kressenstein – selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier-General Edward Chaytor&#x27;s New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence. The counter-attack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter-attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners, Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks. However, for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130 British casualties, it was a clear-cut victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside West Africa Campaign.

In his report to the War Office on the battle, Murray passed lightly over the part played by the Anzac Mounted Division. The majority of awards for the Battle of Romani went to British troops, including a generous number to officers of Murray&#x27;s staff. Lawrence was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, but Chauvel, having already been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for South Africa and Companion of the Order of the Bath for Gallipoli, was recommended for a lesser award, which he refused. In view of this, Murray decided that Chauvel should receive no award at all, and he was merely mentioned in despatches.

====Desert Column====
In October 1916 Major General Sir Charles Macpherson Dobell, a Canadian officer with broad experience in fighting colonial wars took over command of Eastern Force. Its advanced troops – including Chauvel&#x27;s Anzac Mounted Division – became part of the newly formed Desert Column under Major-General Sir Philip Chetwode, a British cavalry baronet. In the Battle of Magdhaba in December 1916, Chauvel therefore was answerable to the newly arrived Chetwode, instead of the distant commanders on the Canal. His intelligence on enemy dispositions was considerably better thanks to the work of the aviators of No. 5 Wing, which consisted of No. 14 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps and No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps. However, he had only limited time to capture the position and its water supply, and when the issue was in doubt Chauvel ordered a withdrawal. The order was ignored by Brigadier-General Charles Frederick Cox of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, whose troops carried the position, and was cancelled by Chetwode. Despite his premature withdrawal order, it was Chauvel&#x27;s plan of attack that won the battle. &quot;Chauvel&#x27;s leadership,&quot; wrote Henry Gullett, &quot;was distinguished by the rapidity with which he summed up the very obscure Turkish position in the early morning, and by his judgement and characteristic patience in keeping so much of his force in reserve until the fight developed sufficiently to ensure its most profitable employment.&quot;

Chauvel gained another important success in the Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger and the threat of its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel&#x27;s concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray&#x27;s mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.

However, Chauvel continued to be concerned about the lack of recognition for Australian and New Zealand troops and on 28 September 1917 wrote:
Chauvel appended 32 names of soldiers he recommended for awards that had been ignored. Two New Zealanders recommended for a Bar to their Distinguished Service Orders (DSO) were not even mentioned in despatches and an outstanding Australian regimental commander recommended for the CMG was also not even mentioned in despatches, while a brigade commander and a staff officer Chauvel recommended for DSOs received mentions.

===Palestine===
In January 1917, a second mounted division – the Imperial Mounted Division – was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh from experience in the Senussi Campaign, Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel&#x27;s approval but was contrary to the policy of the Australian Government, which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir Robert Anderson to Cairo to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.

In the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917, Chauvel&#x27;s mission was similar to Rafa and Magdhaba, but on a larger scale. He enveloped the Turkish position at Gaza while the British 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division attempted to capture it. When this failed, Chetwode ordered Chauvel to attempt to capture Gaza from the rear. Chauvel successfully improvised a late afternoon assault on Gaza that captured the town despite the barriers of high cactus hedges and fierce enemy opposition, entering it after dark, only to have an out-of-touch Dobell order the mounted troops to withdraw, despite Chauvel&#x27;s protests. This time his brigadiers at the front, Generals Ryrie and Chaytor, although they believed that Gaza could be held, felt compelled to obey, as they could not see the whole battle. All guns, including captured ones were hauled away, as were all unwounded prisoners, the wounded and even the dead. Chauvel ensured that wounded Turkish prisoners that were unfit to make the march to Deir al-Balah were each left with a full water bottle.

Dobell launched the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917 with a full scale frontal assault supported by naval gunfire, tanks and poison gas. It ended even more unsatisfactorily, and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April. His place was taken by Chetwode, while Chauvel took over the Desert Column, thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of lieutenant general. Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor. In June, during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine, General Sir Edmund Allenby took over the EEF from Murray. Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re-organised his command along more regular lines. Eastern Force was abolished and two corps headquarters were formed, XX Corps under Chetwode and XXI Corps under Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin. The three corps commanders were professional soldiers, none of whom had graduated from a military college or a staff college, they had all been commissioned from the militia or volunteers.

Two weeks before Allenby arrived, Chauvel attended an awards ceremony:
====Desert Mounted Corps====

When Chauvel learned that the Desert Column was to be renamed the 2nd Cavalry Corps he requested Desert Mounted Corps. The corps consisted of the Anzac Mounted Division, the Australian Mounted Division, the newly formed Yeomanry Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade.

Although some British thought that Allenby should replace Chauvel with a British officer, Allenby retained him in command. However he overrode Chauvel&#x27;s own preference to appoint a Royal Horse Guards officer, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse, known as &quot;Wombat&quot;, as Chauvel&#x27;s chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps. A &quot;brass-bound brigadier&quot; was quoted as saying, &quot;Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world&#x27;s history to an Australian.&quot; On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, &quot;I cannot say how much I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand – it is my own trade – but Fate has willed it otherwise.&quot; At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa. Chetwode&#x27;s &quot;arms length&quot; style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza.

In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, it was again Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the critical role. Chetwode believed that the EEF did not have the resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at Beersheba, in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade – the last of history&#x27;s great cavalry charges – to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List.
Chauvel, however, was still disappointed with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing the commitment of the Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy. In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time. In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan. Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of Spahis and Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique.

In September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of two of his mounted divisions. Allenby launched a surprise attack on the enemy and won the Battle of Megiddo. He then followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history – 167 km in only three days. This time he succeeded in destroying the Turkish army. The Desert Mounted Corps moved across the Golan Heights and captured Damascus on 1 October. Between 19 September and 2 October, the Australian Mounted Division lost 21 killed and 71 wounded, and captured 31,335 Turkish prisoners. To restore calm in the city, Chauvel ordered a show of force. Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence later lampooned this as a &quot;triumphal entry&quot; but it was actually a shrewd political stroke, freeing Chauvel&#x27;s forces to advance another 300 km to Aleppo, which was captured on 25 October. Five days later, Turkey surrendered. For this victory, Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches.

Chauvel was obliged to remain in the Middle East due to the situation in Syria and the Egyptian Rebellion, although he was able to have Lady Chauvel join him there in January 1919. By April, the situation had calmed and Chauvel was able to hand over command of the AIF in the Middle East to Ryrie. Chauvel and Lady Chauvel then headed for London on the RMS &quot;Malwa&quot;. They arrived in time for him to lead Australian troops on a victory march through the city on 3 May. Soon after, he was hospitalised at the 3rd London General Hospital at Wandsworth with appendicitis. The whole Chauvel family was able to sail for home on the transport HMAT &quot;Demosthenes&quot; on 26 July 1919. For his services as commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, Chauvel was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1919, was awarded the French &quot;Croix de Guerre avec Palme&quot; by the President of France and the Order of the Nile (2nd Class) by the Sultan of Egypt, and was mentioned in despatches for the 11th time. At his special request, when he was conferred with vestments and accoutrements of the Order of St Michael and St George by King George V, the King dubbed him &quot;Sir Harry&quot; rather than &quot;Sir Henry&quot;.

==Later life==

===Between the wars===
Chauvel&#x27;s AIF appointment was terminated on 9 December 1919, and the next day he was appointed Inspector General, the Army&#x27;s most senior post, which he held until 1930. The office of Inspector General had been created as an auditor who provided annual reports to the Council of Defence. In the event of war, it was intended that the Inspector General would become the Commander in Chief with the Military Board as his general staff. Chauvel&#x27;s annual reports tended to emphasise the parlous state of the nation&#x27;s defences. He warned, for example, that if war came, soldiers would &quot;be subject to the unfair handicap and the certainty of increased loss of life which inferiority in armament and shortage of ammunition must inevitability entail&quot;. Looking back from the perspective of World War II, historian Gavin Long noted that Chauvel&#x27;s annual reports were &quot;a series of wise and penetrating examinations of Australian military problems of which, however, little notice was taken&quot;.
In February 1920, Chauvel was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, back-dated to 31 December 1919. In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee&#x27;s recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement in the face of defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922. On Lieutenant General Brudenell White&#x27;s retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff. Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. He attempted to maintain the Army&#x27;s structure in the face of short-sighted politicians intent on cutting expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When conscription was abolished by Prime Minister James Scullin&#x27;s government in 1929, it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.
Chauvel&#x27;s sons Ian and Edward resigned their commissions in the Australian Army in 1930 and 1932 respectively, and accepted commissions in cavalry regiments of the British Indian Army. His daughter Elyne married Thomas Walter Mitchell, a grazier. Chauvel became a frequent visitor to their property &quot;Towong Hill&quot; near Corryong, Victoria. He was staying at Towong Hill during the Black Friday Bushfires of 1939. When the property was threatened by fire, he directed the firefighting effort, and at one point climbed a tree close to the house to hack away burning branches.

The dedication of the Shrine of Remembrance in 1934 saw a series of reunions. Ian and Edward arrived from India on leave, Alexander Godley came from Britain, and Richard Howard-Vyse as chief of staff to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. In 1937, Chauvel travelled to the United Kingdom as head of the Australian contingent for the coronation of King George VI, where he was welcomed by Chetwode and Howard-Vyse. Chauvel had the contingent dressed as light horsemen, wearing emu plumes, bandoliers and spurs. When the Dominion troops assembled at Buckingham Palace to receive their King George VI Coronation Medals, Chauvel led the parade, with Howard-Vyse as his chief of staff. On the way back, the contingent visited France, where ceremonies were held at the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial and the Arc de Triomphe. Chauvel frequently led Anzac Day parades through Melbourne but resigned from the leadership of the march in 1938 in protest against a decision by the Returned and Services League of Australia to change the form of service at the Shrine from a Christian to a secular one.

===Second World War and legacy===
During the Second World War, Chauvel was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the Volunteer Defence Corps (VDC), the Australian version of the British Home Guard. Following Brudenell White&#x27;s death in the Canberra air disaster, Prime Minister Robert Menzies turned to Chauvel for advice on a successor as Chief of the General Staff. On Chauvel&#x27;s recommendation, Menzies appointed Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee to the post. During the war, Chauvel&#x27;s son Ian served as staff officer in the Italian campaign, while Edward was posted to New Guinea to learn about jungle warfare from the Australian Army. Chauvel&#x27;s daughter Eve joined the Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Naval Service and spent a day in a lifeboat in the North Atlantic after her ship was torpedoed by a U-boat. Tom Mitchell was captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore. Chauvel remained with the VDC, based at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne but constantly travelling on inspections until his death on 4 March 1945.
Chauvel was given a state funeral service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne officiated by the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, Joseph John Booth, after which he was cremated at Springvale Crematorium with full military honours. Eight generals acted as pallbearers: Lieutenant General John Northcott, Chief of the General Staff; Lieutenant General John Whitham, Corps Commander, VDC; Major General James Cannan, Quartermaster General; Major General Charles Brand; Major General Cyril Clowes, GOC, Victoria Line of Communications Area; Major General John Austin Chapman, Deputy Chief of General Staff; Major General Charles Lloyd, Adjutant General; and Major General Clive Steele, Engineer in Chief.

Portraits of Chauvel are held by the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the Naval and Military Club in Melbourne, and the Imperial War Museum in London. A portrait by George Washington Lambert is in the possession of the family. Chauvel is commemorated in a bronze plaque in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne. His sword is in Christ Church, South Yarra, his uniform in the Australian War Memorial, and his saddle is kept by the 1st Armoured Regiment in South Australia. There is also a memorial window in the chapel of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Chauvel Street in North Ryde, Sydney is named in his honour.

Chauvel&#x27;s daughter Elyne Mitchell wrote a number of non-fiction works about her father and his corps. In his book &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, T. E. Lawrence provided a wildly inaccurate version of Chauvel. Charles Bean noted that &quot;this wise, good and considerate commander was far from the stupid martinet that readers of Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; might infer.&quot; Lawrence confessed that &quot;little of his book was strict truth though most of it was based on fact.&quot;

Chauvel&#x27;s nephew Charles Chauvel became a well-known film director, whose films included &quot;Forty Thousand Horsemen&quot; (1940), about the Battle of Beersheba.

Harry Chauvel was portrayed in film: by Bill Kerr in &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot; (1987), which covered the exploits of an Australian cavalry regiment during the Third Battle of Gaza; by Ray Edwards in &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot; (1990), which took place around the 1919 Paris peace conference; and by Colin Baker in the 1992 &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; TV movie &quot;Daredevils of the Desert&quot;, another retelling of the Third Battle of Gaza from the director of &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot;.

<text>Ladder streets are narrow streets in Hong Kong comprising steps. Most are found between Central and Sheung Wan and Mid-Levels on Hong Kong Island, from Queen&#x27;s Road Central, through Hollywood Road and a few other cross streets, to Caine Road at the Mid-Levels. Other ladder streets exist outside of the immediate Mid-Levels area, such as Sands Street in Kennedy Town.

Note that there is indeed a street named Ladder Street, composed entirely of stone steps, in Sheung Wan.

While some ladder streets are made only of traditional steps, some at a moderate incline have portions that could be traversed with a rickshaw or cart. These portions had raised stones perpendicular to the street at regular intervals acting like a ratchet so that carts and rickshaws could be easily stopped and parked. This kind of paving can be found on Pottinger Street.

The Duddell Street steps were declared a monument by the Antiquities and Monuments Office.

== History ==

Shortly after their arrival in Hong Kong, the British built administrative buildings on the northern shore of the island, in the area which came to be called Victoria and later called Central. The water met the island at what is now Queen&#x27;s Road. There was no flat land, so during the brief tenure of Sir Henry Pottinger, the first governor of the colony, from 1841 to 1844, streets of steps were planned. The first recorded ladder street was built between Queen&#x27;s Road and Gough Street in 1845. Remaining ladder streets steps are some of the very oldest structures in the territory.

The streets were originally made with the local pink granite. Most have been replaced with concrete.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-13:1998, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 13: Latin alphabet No. 7&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1998. It is informally referred to as Latin-7 or &quot;Baltic Rim&quot;. It was designed to cover the Baltic languages, and added characters used in Polish missing from the earlier encodings ISO 8859-4 and ISO 8859-10. Unlike these two, it does not cover the Nordic languages. It is similar to the earlier-published Windows-1257; its encoding of the Estonian alphabet also matches IBM-922. This is also known as Latvian standard LVS 8.

ISO-8859-13 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429.

Microsoft has assigned code page 28603 a.k.a. Windows-28603 to ISO-8859-13. IBM has assigned code page 921 to ISO-8859-13 until that code page was extended. ISO-IR 206 (code page 901, later extended) replaces the currency sign at position A4 with the euro sign (€).

==Codepage layout==

Differences from ISO-8859-1 have the Unicode code point number below the character.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-14:1998, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 14: Latin alphabet No. 8 (Celtic)&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1998. It is informally referred to as Latin-8 or &quot;Celtic&quot;. It was designed to cover the Celtic languages, such as Irish, Manx, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton.

ISO-8859-14 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. CeltScript made an extension for Windows called Extended Latin-8. Microsoft has assigned code page 28604 a.k.a. Windows-28604 to ISO-8859-14. FreeDOS assigned code page 58163 to ISO-8859-14.

==History==
ISO-8859-14 was originally proposed for the Sami languages. ISO 8859-12 was proposed for Celtic. Later, ISO 8859-12 was proposed for Devanagari, so the Celtic proposal was changed to ISO 8859-14. The Sami proposal was changed to ISO 8859-15, but it got rejected as an ISO/IEC 8859 part, although it was registered as ISO-IR-197.

The original proposal used a different arrangement of points 0xA1–BF. At the committee draft stage of the specification, a dotless i was included at 0xAE, which was changed to a registered trademark sign (matching ISO-8859-1) in the final publication.

ISO-IR-182, an earlier (registered in 1994) modification of ISO-8859-1, had added the letters Ẁ, Ẃ, Ẅ, Ỳ, Ÿ, Ŵ, Ŷ and their lowercase forms (except for ÿ, which was already included) for Welsh language use. The final published version of ISO-8859-14 includes these letters in the same positions which they appear at in ISO-IR-182.

==Codepage layout==
Differences from ISO-8859-1 have the Unicode code point number below the character.

===Draft layout===
The first draft had positions A0-BF different. It did not include the pilcrow sign, but included the cent sign instead at its Latin-1 position. Later, it was ruled that the pilcrow sign was more common, so the pilcrow sign remains at its Latin-1 position, and the cent sign was removed instead.

Differences from ISO-8859-14 have the Unicode code point below them.

The same encoding was defined as Romanian Standard SR 14111 in 1998, named the &quot;Romanian Character Set for Information Interchange&quot;. It is informally referred to as Latin-10 or &quot;South-Eastern European&quot;.

ISO-8859-16 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429.
Microsoft has assigned code page 28606 a.k.a. Windows-28606 to ISO-8859-16. FreeDOS has assigned code page 65500 to ISO-8859-16.

Originally, ISO 8859-16 was proposed as a different encoding which was revised and renamed ISO 8859-0 by 1997, and is now ISO 8859-15 after a further revision.

<text>Damon Michael Gough (born 2 October 1969), known by the stage name Badly Drawn Boy, is an English indie singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.

Gough chose his stage name from a character in the show &quot;Sam and the Magic Ball&quot;, which he saw on TV at a party in Trafford, Greater Manchester, in 1995. Before he thought of using this name he made some business cards, each one unique, with a printed picture of a drawing by his nephew and a small collage by Gough.

A chance meeting with Andy Votel at the Generation X bar in Manchester, where Gough&#x27;s friends Scott Abraham and Damon Hayhurst were contributing to an exhibition by the Space Monkey Clothing Company and Votel was DJing, led to the foundation of Twisted Nerve Records.

In 2002, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named Badly Drawn Boy in their list of the &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die,&quot; although this was as part of a sub-list of &quot;5 Bands That Could Go Either Way&quot; on account of Gough&#x27;s tendency to talk and tell stories for extended periods in concert rather than play songs.

==History==
===Early years===
Gough, though born in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, grew up in the Breightmet area of Bolton, Greater Manchester, England. He cites Bruce Springsteen as his music hero. His recording career began in September 1997 with the five track vinyl release &quot;EP1&quot;. This was distributed among friends and family members.

In April 1998, Gough released his second EP, &quot;EP2&quot;. This had one track less than its predecessor but twice as many copies were pressed. The highlight track, &quot;I Love You All,&quot; was later transferred to a music box which was released alongside the EP. The box plays eleven seconds of the song and is considered much rarer than the record itself due to its limited production.

Gough&#x27;s third EP, &quot;EP3,&quot; was released in November 1998 on both CD and vinyl formats, and was the first release in what became a long-term partnership with XL Recordings. In the same year he collaborated with Unkle for their first album &quot;Psyence Fiction&quot;. &quot;Road Movie&quot; was released as a live recording with the band Doves. The B-side to the single was another track from the EP, &quot;My Friend Cubilas&quot;. Music videos were recorded for both tracks.

=== Mainstream success: 1999–2002===
&quot;It Came from the Ground&quot; was the next EP, released in March 1999 on CD and vinyl. The style of this recording focused on woodland environments, an aspect displayed in both the cover art and the title track&#x27;s video. Also released during this period was the single &quot;Whirlpool&quot;. An instrumental was released on vinyl in April 1999.

Gough&#x27;s last EP, &quot;Once Around the Block&quot;, was released in August 1999 in two vinyl formats and one CD edition. The release is almost short enough to be considered a single.
Following the success of his early EPs, Gough&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot;, was released in June 2000, accompanied by four singles (including a re-release of &quot;Once Around the Block&quot;).

The album was critically acclaimed and Badly Drawn Boy was successful in winning the 2000 Mercury Music Prize, beating his contemporaries Doves to the £20,000 prize. The album sold well (300,000 copies) and is widely considered to be his defining work.

The Badly Drawn Boy band throughout this successful period consisted of Matt Wardle (keyboards/vocals), Robin File (guitar), Sean McCann (bass guitar) latterly replaced by the ex-Smiths bass guitarist Andy Rourke, Dave Verner (drums).

After a short break, Gough returned to score the film adaptation of Nick Hornby&#x27;s novel &quot;About a Boy&quot;. The movie was directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. Impressed by his past work, the Weitz brothers asked Gough to score the film, a task which he undertook alone, with the assistance of producer Steve McLaughlin. Three singles from the album were released during 2002.

His third album, &quot;Have You Fed the Fish?&quot;, introduced more guitars and an increasingly mainstream pop sound which was not welcomed by all critics. The album is a play on Gough&#x27;s minor celebrity status. Another three singles and a long American tour accompanied the album. The single &quot;You Were Right&quot; received heavy airplay on BBC Radio 2, became his first UK top ten single and includes lyrical references to music icons such as Madonna and John Lennon.

===Later years===
After his long spell in America, Gough suffered from homesickness and decided to record his next album closer to home. Recorded at Moolah Rouge studios in Stockport, Greater Manchester, &quot;One Plus One Is One&quot; was a portrait of his personal life. Documenting a death of a close friend and the loss of a grandfather in the Battle of Normandy, the album was released in 2004. It was not a great commercial success, and Gough decided to leave his contract with XL Recordings after only one single was released. He then signed to EMI.

Two years went by before &quot;Born in the U.K.&quot;, which aimed to explain Gough&#x27;s experience of growing up in the United Kingdom. The album was promoted with a small UK tour, profits from which were donated to Oxfam, a charity which &quot;offers the chance for thousands of people to use music to achieve something together, which is an idea that gets me excited&quot;, said Gough. Gough also toured the US behind the album.

The album &quot;Is There Nothing We Could Do?&quot;, with music taken from and inspired by the film, &quot;The Fattest Man in Britain&quot;, was released on his own BDB Records label in 2009.

His seventh album, &quot;It&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Thinking Pt.1 – Photographing Snowflakes&quot;, the first of a planned trilogy of albums all to be released under the title &quot;It&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Thinking&quot;, was released in October 2010. For some of the tracks on this album he used his current live band, which consisted of Manchester musical friends Mike TV of Beats for beginners on guitar, Stephen Fretwell on bass and Jay Sikora on drums 

In 2011, a portrait of Gough painted by British artist Joe Simpson was exhibited around the UK including a solo exhibition at The Royal Albert Hall.

In March 2012, he released another soundtrack, for &quot;Being Flynn&quot;, directed by Paul Weitz who had worked with Gough previously on the soundtrack album &quot;About a Boy&quot;.

In July 2015, to mark the fifteenth anniversary of the release of &quot;The Hour of the Bewilderbeast&quot;, Gough undertook a short UK tour.

In 2020 he released his first studio album for 10 years, &quot;Banana Skin Shoes&quot;.

==Documentary and media appearances==
There have been three documentaries made about Badly Drawn Boy: &quot;Open Map&quot; in 2007, &quot;Ipso Facto&quot; in 2010, and &quot;About A Badly Drawn Boy&quot;. The first two tour documentaries remain unreleased, while the last, about Gough and his debut album &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot;, was released in 2018.

In December 2015, Badly Drawn Boy appeared on a celebrity edition of Mastermind. His specialist subject was the singer Bruce Springsteen.

In October 2017, he had a cameo role in the final episode of &quot;Cold Feet&quot; (Series 7) where he played a busker.

<doc id="428031" wikidata="Q3095037" url="?curid=428031" title="Synthetic scale">
<text>In music, a synthetic scale is a scale that derives from a traditional diatonic major scale by altering of one degree by a semitone in either direction. Composer Ferruccio Busoni originally explored these scales in his &quot;A New Esthetic of Music&quot; and their number and variety were later clarified by J. Murray Barbour, who also proposed applying the procedure to scales of more or less than seven degrees, including pentatonic scales.

These synthetic pitch collections may serve as basic melodic or harmonic material for a passage of music. However, the hundreds of available scales cause Murray Barbour to propose that, &quot;The whole problem is of greater theoretical interest than of practical worth.&quot;

Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s mystic chord, when considered as a scale (the Prometheus scale), is an example of a synthetic chord—in that it is a whole tone scale with one degree altered. However, it was not the generating element to Scriabin&#x27;s music, nor does his derivation of it from the whole tone scale necessarily indicate knowledge of Busoni&#x27;s theories. Starting on C, the Prometheus scale is

:&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 6/4 c4 d e fis a bes c
&lt;/score&gt;

The semitone steps for this scale are 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2. By adding a G to the scale, one would end up with the LydianVII, the fourth degree of the Melodic Minor scale.

The pitches of synthetic scales may duplicate pre-existing scales, though their derivation is different and their use is often quite different.

<doc id="428039" wikidata="Q4637775" url="?curid=428039" title="42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division">
<text>The 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army. The division was raised in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force (TF), originally as the East Lancashire Division, and was redesignated as the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division on 25 May 1915. It was the first TF division to be sent overseas during the First World War. The division fought at Gallipoli, in the Sinai desert and on the Western Front in France and Belgium. Disbanded after the war, it was reformed in the Territorial Army (TA), in the Second World War it served as the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and fought in Belgium and France before being evacuated at Dunkirk. The division was later reformed in the United Kingdom and, in November 1941, was converted into the 42nd Armoured Division, which was disbanded in October 1943 without serving overseas. A 2nd Line duplicate formation, the 66th Infantry Division, was created when the Territorials were doubled in both world wars.

The division was disbanded during the war but was reformed in the TA in 1947 after the Second World War. Beckett 2008 says that TA units that were in suspended animation were formally reactivated on 1 January 1947, although no personnel were assigned until commanding officers and permanent staff had been appointed in March and April 1947. From December 1955, the division was placed on a lower establishment, for home defence purposes only. On 1 May 1961, the division was merged with North West District to become 42nd Lancashire Division/North West District.

==Formation==
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. One of the divisions was the East Lancashire Division. In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was, from 1910, in the National Buildings at St Mary&#x27;s Parsonage in Manchester.

==First World War==
The division was embodied upon the outbreak of war. The war station was intended to be Ireland; but, due to its pacific state, the intended move did not materialise. After a brief period at their drill halls, the various units proceeded to large tented camps at Turton Bottoms (near Bolton), Chesham (near Bury) and Holingworth Lake, Littleborough (near Rochdale). The personnel were asked to volunteer for overseas service, and the overwhelming majority did so, the deficiencies made up of men from the National Reserve and other re-enlistments. The &#x27;home service&#x27; men formed the cadre of duplicate units, intended to train the rush of volunteers at the drill halls. These would form the divisional reserve, and later become the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division.

In 1914, the East Lancashire Division was one of 14 infantry divisions and 55 mounted regiments, called the Yeomanry, that made up the Territorial Force. Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, described these divisions and regiments of mainly white–collar workers as &quot;a town clerk&#x27;s army&quot;. Their junior officers were trained at the Officer Training Corps set up at the universities and large public schools, such as Eton and Harrow. Kitchener sent these forces to the peripheral campaigns; to the Sudan, Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Caucasus, to release Regular British Army soldiers for duty on the Western Front because he thought these amateur soldiers &#x27;might not be able to hold their own with the German Army&#x27;.

===Egypt===

The East Lancashire Division arrived in Egypt on 25 September 1914 and served in the interior, around Cairo (with some elements stationed in Cyprus and the Sudan) together with some Yeomanry units, and the Australian and New Zealand contingents before going to Gallipoli.

The division was sent to Egypt to defend the Suez Canal against anticipated Turkish attacks. The 15 pounder gun batteries were deployed at key points on the west bank in support of Indian Army and New Zealand troops manning guardposts. The 20th Battery (Bolton Artillery) fired the division&#x27;s first artillery rounds of the Great War, and the first of the Territorial Force of the campaign, near El Ferdan on 2 February 1915. The 19th Battery (Bolton Artillery) was in action in support of Indian and New Zealand troops between Tussum and Serapeum on the night and morning of 3–4 February 1915, against the attempted crossing of the canal by the 74th Regiment, Turkish 25th Division.

===Gallipoli===

Beginning in early May 1915, the division joined the British Army Corps, from June known as VIII Corps, at Cape Helles following the failure of the Allies to achieve the anticipated swift success at Gallipoli during April. On 26 May 1915 the division received its number, becoming the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, and the brigades were also numbered, becoming 125th (1/1st Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade, 126th (1/1st East Lancashire) Brigade and 127th (1/1st Manchester) Brigade.

The 4th (Blackburn) battery, 1 section of the 6th (Burnley) battery, and 19th and 20th (Bolton) batteries did not join the division on Gallipoli until 23/24 September, and the 1st/2nd East Lancs Brigade RFA (Manchester Artillery) arrived in Egypt in May from Britain and remained in Egypt.

The 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade landed in time to participate in the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May and the 126th Brigade arrived on 11 May. The entire division was involved in the Third Battle of Krithia on 4 June.

The division carried out the Helles diversion at the start of the Battle of Sari Bair in what became known as the Battle of Krithia Vineyard. Captain William Thomas Forshaw of the 1/9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in this battle from 7 to 9 August.

2nd Lieutenant Alfred Victor Smith of the 1/5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his action at Helles on 23 December.

The division remained at Gallipoli until the final evacuation of Helles in January 1916 but was severely depleted by casualties and illness. 42nd Division&#x27;s casualties at Gallipoli were 395 officers and 8152 other ranks killed, wounded and missing.

===Egypt and the Sinai Campaign===
After the evacuation of Gallipoli, the division returned to Egypt, and was renamed the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. As such it participated in the Battle of Romani and the advance from Romani to Katia.

The 42nd Division served at Kantara on the Suez Canal in No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences under General Lawrence until they were entrained for the railhead at Pelusium on the first day of the Battle of Romani on 4 August 1916.
On arrival late in the day, the 127th Brigade of the 42nd Division took over outpost duties at 1930 hours while the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigades, which had been heavily involved in fighting during the day, withdrew to water and rest at Pelusium.

On the second day of battle, 5 August 1916, the 42nd Division along with the 52nd (Lowland) Division, which had fought the previous day from their entrenched position, were ordered to move out to support the Australian Light Horse and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades in a pursuit of the enemy. The 42nd Division was not prepared for the conditions they found in the Sinai desert. They had not been trained to operate in heavy sand in mid summer heat, and with insufficient water, extreme distress and tragedy followed. The mounted troops alone, were unable to stop the enemy making a disciplined withdrawal to water at Katia and to fall back in good order, the following day.

The 127th Brigade, 42nd Division eventually reached Katia the next day, 6 August; 800 men had died in the two-day march from Pelusium Station. The 125th Brigade of the 42nd Division and the 155th, and 157th brigades of the 52nd Division also had many men fall victim to thirst and the blazing sun; the infantry pursuit could not go on.

Robert Bethel, Army Service Corps, and McPherson, an officer in the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, worked to transport provisions and water to the 125th and 127th brigades. They recorded what they saw of these terrible days. Nearly 50 years after serving with the 42nd Division in the Sinai, one veteran, gunner J. Thompson, confessed that the &quot;sight of a leaking tap&quot; made him &quot;squirm&quot;.

By December 1916, the 42nd Division was furnishing units to protect the lines of communication at Salmana, Abu Tilul and the railway station Maadan and took part in a practice attack on 13 December. On 21 December, 42nd and 52nd Divisions marched from Kilo 128 to Bardawil and continued to move eastwards towards Masaid.

On 17 January 1917, the 42nd Division was no longer in the Sinai Campaign, having been among the first of the Territorial Force to receive orders for the Western Front. The division was replaced in Desert Column by another Territorial Division, the 53rd (Welsh) Division commanded by Dallas. The two other Territorial infantry divisions, the 52nd at Rafa and the 54th (East Anglian) Division ordered out to Romani from the Suez Canal, were put directly under General Dobell commander of Eastern Force. The 42nd Division departed Egypt early in February 1917.

===Western Front===

The division moved to France and joined 3 Corps in the Fourth Army in March 1917. It relieved the 48th (South Midland) Division on 8 May 1917 and held the line at Épehy before relieving the 20th (Light) Division and holding the line at Havrincourt, north of Epéhy, from 23 May 1917. Its infantry was relieved by the 58th (2/1st London) Division on 8 July 1917 but its divisional artillery remained in the line in support of 58th and then 9th (Scottish) Division at Havrincourt Wood. It moved to the Ytres sector on 9 July 1917.
On 23 August 1917, it joined V Corps in the Fifth Army, although the infantry in Poperinghe area behind Ypres for training. Its divisional artillery entered line immediately in support of the 15th (Scottish) Division near Potijze Chateau. Its infantry relieved the 15th (Scottish) Division in the line to the right of Potijze Road near Frezenberg Ridge at Ypres on 1 September 1917 and on 6 September the 125th Brigade made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fortified Iberian, Borry and Beck Farms during the Third Battle of Ypres.

The divisional infantry were relieved by the 9th (Scottish) Division and retired to Poperinghe area on 18 September 1917. Its divisional artillery remained in the line until 29 September, participated in the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge (20–26 September 1917) and advanced to exposed positions on Frezenberg Ridge on 25 September. On 26 September it relieved the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division. The divisional artillery rejoined and it held the line at Nieuport.


On 29 November 1917 it relieved the 25th Division and held the line at Givenchy on the La Bassée sector. It constructed fortifications according to the new British defensive doctrine of &quot;defended localities&quot; in anticipation of major German attack. Private Walter Mills of C Company, the 1/10th Manchesters, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for actions at Red Dragon Crater, Givenchy on the night of 10 December 1917.

It was relieved by the 55th (West Lancashire) Division on 15 February 1918. It was held in reserve and undertook training at Busnes–Burbure–Fouquieres area, forming part of the I Corps reserve and then the GHQ reserve from 1 March 1918.

On 23 March 1918 it joined VI Corps under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Aylmer Haldane in the Third Army, initially in reserve, and then at Ervillers, to defend the line against the German 17th Army under the command of General Otto von Below on the right (i.e. north) wing of the German Spring Offensive (&quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot;) in the First Battle of the Somme (1918) and then the First Battle of Bapaume.

It counterattacked in the afternoon with seven tanks and 300 infantry from Logeast Wood to delay the German VI Reserve Corps on 25 March 1918. The 10th Manchesters repelled eight attacks by the German 2nd Guard Reserve Division, at Ervillers.

It retired the Ervillers–Bucquoy area on 26 March 1918. Together the 42nd and 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division held the Rossignol Wood–Bucquoy sector under heavy shelling against six attacks by the German 3rd Guard Infantry Division, the last with assistance of 11 Mk. IV tanks.
It then held the line until end of final German assault on 5 April 1918 at Bucquoy and held the line at Bucquoy, Gommecourt, Hébuterne from 6 April 1918. It served with the IV Corps in the Third Army from 21 August 1918 and attacked and advanced Miraumont, across the River Ancre, Pys, Warlencourt during the Second Battle of the Somme (1918) including the Battle of Albert (1918). Their opponent was the 183rd Division. Lance-Sergeant Edward Smith of the 1/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions in the capture of The Lozenge (Hill 140, a German machine-gun nest) on 21 August and enemy counter-attacks on 22 August.

The infantry withdrew for two days rest in Miraumont–Pys area on 25 August 1918. The divisional artillery went into action under heavy fire in support of 63rd (Royal Naval) Division on the outskirts of Loupart Wood. It then relieved 63rd Division in the line and resumed its advance on 28 August 1918. It attacked and advanced to Thilloy, Riencourt-lès-Bapaume, Villers-au-Flos, Ytres, across the Canal du Nord to Metz-en-Couture in the Second Battle of the Somme (1918) including the Second Battle of Bapaume. Its infantry relieved by New Zealand Division and moved to rest in Pys-Tholloy area on 6 September 1918. The divisional artillery remained in the line in support of New Zealand Division. On 21 September 1918 it relieved 37th Division east of Havrincourt Wood.

On 27 September 1918 it attacked and advanced Havrincourt Wood through the Siegfriedstellung (Hindenburg Line) via objectives called the Black, Red, Brown, Yellow and Blue lines, to Welsh Ridge. The Hindenburg Line was attacked in enfilade, or diagonally, as can be seen from the map. Many casualties were sustained from machine guns situated in Beaucamps to the right of the division&#x27;s front during the Battle of the Canal du Nord. Its infantry relieved by New Zealand Division and withdrew to Havrincourt Wood for rest on 29 September 2018. The divisional artillery remained in action in support of the New Zealand Division in the Pursuit to the Selle.

On 9 October 1918 its infantry marched up to the front through Lesdain, Esnes, Beauvois and relieved New Zealand Division, who had established a bridgehead across the River Selle at Briastre. It defended Briastre against German counterattacks and shelling from 12 October 1918 and then advanced across the River Selle to Marou, Virtigneul and Belle Vue Farm during the Battle of the Selle. Private Alfred Robert Wilkinson of the 1/5th Manchesters was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions on 20 October 1918 at Marou. The division&#x27;s opponent in these actions was the 25th Division.

It was relieved by New Zealand Division on 24 October 1918 and withdrew to Beauvois for a rest. It then moved up though Le Quesnoy and &quot;Forêt de Mormal&quot; in support of the advance of the 37th Division and New Zealand Division on 3 November 1918. It relieved the New Zealand Division in line of attack on eastern edge of Forest of Mormal and attacked and advanced to Hautmont in the Arrondissement of Avesnes-sur-Helpe on 6 November 1918. It was standing fast on line Maubeuge–Avesnes-sur-Helpe Road when the Armistice of 11 November 1918 came into force.

==First World War composition==
The infantry were equipped with the obsolescent Long Magazine Lee–Enfield (MLE) rifle from embarkation in 1914 until arrival in France in March 1917, when they were re-equipped with the standard modern Short Magazine Lee–Enfield (SMLE).

(The Cumberland Artillery)Originally, each of the 2 batteries was equipped with 4 obsolescent BL 5 inch Howitzers (&quot;some of them Omdurman veterans&quot;).Joined Division on Gallipoli in July 1915 from Egypt. However, only limited supplies of the new 40 pound 5-inch shells were sent from Mudros (older shells were 50 pounds). No range tables for the lighter and hence longer-range shell were available, and they had a new pattern fuse for which no fuse keys were available. Hence, use of these howitzers at Gallipoli became very limited.Renamed 213 Brigade in May 1916.Re-equipped in June 1916 with modern QF 4.5 inch Howitzers.
** 1st Cumberland (Howitzer) Battery from Carlisle. Renamed A Battery in May 1916.
** 2nd Cumberland (Howitzer) Battery from Workington. Renamed B Battery in May 1916.
* 2nd Lancashire Heavy Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery, from Liverpool. Left in England when division embarked for Egypt.

====1917 field artillery reorganization====
In February 1917, the Cumberland Artillery / 213 Brigade was disbanded and its two howitzer batteries merged into the 18-pounder brigades in accordance with the new artillery brigade philosophy. Existing four-gun, 18-pounder batteries in each of 210, 211 and 212 Brigades were merged into six-gun batteries, and the four brigades replaced by new 210 and 211 Brigades, each with 3 six-gun, 18-pounder batteries and one howitzer battery.

Gibbon&#x27;s divisional history states that the above occurred on paper on Christmas Day 1916, when the division was on manoeuvres at Al Mazar, and the reorganization actually occurred in February 1917 on return to the canal zone.

Hence, from February 1917 to 11 November 1918, the divisional artillery consisted of 210 and 211 Brigades, each with 3 six-gun batteries of 18-pounders (A,B,C) and one battery of four 4.5-inch howitzers (D).

==Between the wars==
The division was disbanded after the war, along with the rest of the Territorial Force. However, it was later reformed in the 1920s as the Territorial Army and the 42nd Division was reconstituted.

==Second World War==
Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, the 42nd Division, commanded by Major General William Holmes, was serving under Western Command with its headquarters stationed in Manchester, and was mobilised for war service. The division, still comprising the 125th, 126th, and 127th Infantry Brigades, was understrength, having sent many of its best officers and men to help create a duplicate formation, the 66th Infantry Division, when the possibility of another conflict became obvious. Although war was declared, many of the division&#x27;s units, widely scattered, were engaged in static defensive duties and guarding vulnerable positions, and so were initially unable to concentrate on training. In late September, the division moved to Northumberland where it came under Northern Command and was able to begin training, which continued into the winter.

In January 1940, the division moved to Wiltshire, coming under Southern Command and continued training in order to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. By late March, training had progressed sufficiently and, in mid-April, the division crossed over to France, coming under the control of General Headquarters (GHQ) BEF, before being assigned to Lieutenant General Ronald Adam&#x27;s III Corps on 29 April. While there, the division exchanged some of its units for Regular Army units, as part of official BEF policy, which was, in theory, intended to strengthen the inexperienced TA formations with experienced Regular units but this also had the simultaneous effect of weakening the Regular formations with relatively untrained troops.

The 42nd Division transferred from Adam&#x27;s III Corps to Lieutenant General Michael Barker&#x27;s I Corps on 19 May 1940, nine days after the German Army invaded France, as the division moved into the front line on the River Escaut. On 17 May, Brigadier John Smyth&#x27;s 127th Brigade was detached to join &quot;Mac Force&quot;, under Major General Noel Mason-MacFarlane, temporarily leaving the division with two brigades, returning on 20 May. After the speed of the German advance, the division, along with the rest of the BEF, was forced to retreat to Dunkirk, and was evacuated from Dunkirk on 31 May/1 June, having suffered significant casualties. Around this time the 42nd Division gained its first and only Victoria Cross (VC) of the Second World War, belonging to Captain Marcus Ervine-Andrews of the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, of the 126th Brigade. In addition to being one of the first VCs won by the British Army during the Second World War, he was also the first Irishman to be awarded the medal during the war.

The next few months for the division were spent in England, being re-equipped and reformed, along with anti-invasion duties in the event of a German invasion. Due to the heavy casualties sustained in France, the division absorbed thousands of conscripts as replacements. The division was stationed initially near Middlesbrough, Yorkshire under Northern Command, and in mid-June Major General Holmes, who had been General Officer Commanding (GOC) for over two years, was given command of X Corps and succeeded as GOC 42nd Division by Major General Henry Willcox. On 4 July, the division came under the command of X Corps and then, on 9 September, moving to East Anglia, IV Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Francis Nosworthy, under Eastern Command. The corps was intended by General Sir Alan Brooke, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to be used in a counterattack role if the Germans invaded. On 5 November 1940, the division moved to Gloucestershire upon transferring again, this time to Lieutenant General Hugh Massy&#x27;s XI Corps, and continued its routine of alternating between beach defence and training for potential future operations overseas. In late April 1941, Major General Eric Miles, who had commanded the 126th Brigade with distinction in France and Belgium the year before, assumed command from Major General Willcox, upon the latter&#x27;s promotion to command I Corps, and, after further training, which included numerous large-scale exercises, on 23 October, the 42nd Division transferred again to Northern Command and, five days later, Major General Miles Dempsey assumed command from Major General Miles, who was posted to the 56th (London) Infantry Division as its GOC.

Soon afterwards the division was, due to a shortage of armoured troops in the British Army to face a German invasion of the country, selected by General Brooke (soon to become Chief of the Imperial General Staff), as the most senior TA division, and, in his opinion, &quot;a good division&quot; (as he wrote in his diary after having spent the day with the division on 1 July), for conversion into an armoured formation. Consequently, on 1 November, the division was redesignated as the 42nd Armoured Division, the 125th and 126th Brigades becoming the 10th and 11th Armoured Brigades and the 127th Brigade becoming the 42nd Support Group, respectively. Thus, the division ceased to be an infantry formation. However, after undergoing numerous changes in organisation and personnel, the 42nd Armoured Division, after an existence of just less than two years, was broken up, many of its units reconverting to infantry or disbanding.

==Post 1945==
In 1947, the 42nd and 55th (West Lancashire) Divisions were amalgamated to form the 42nd (Lancashire) Division as part of the post-war Territorial Army. In 1961 the division became a district headquarters as 42nd (Lancashire) Division/District, and it was disbanded on the reduction of the TA into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve on 1 April 1967, when many individual TA units lost their identities. The district headquarters itself formed the core of the structure for the creation of North West District under HQ UK Land Forces in 1972.

In the modern British Army, the 42 North West Brigade has adopted the former 42nd (Lancashire) Division badge.

==Commanders==
General Officers Commanding have included:&lt;br&gt;
==Memorials and monuments==
The 42nd Division Memorial stands on the north edge of Trescault village on the left of the road to Havrincourt. It was unveiled by Major-General Arthur Solly-Flood on Easter Sunday, 1922. The inscription reads: &quot;In memory of all ranks of the 42nd East Lancashire Territorial Division who gave their lives for King and Country during the Great War and in commemoration of the attack and capture of the Hindenburg line at Trescault by the Division on 28 September 1918&quot;. On the north-east side of Trescault, 274 metres to the east of the monument, is Ribecourt Road Cemetery, which the 42nd Division called the Divisional Cemetery, Trescault.

<doc id="428049" wikidata="Q7623897" url="?curid=428049" title="All-female band">
<text>An all-female band is a musical group in popular music that is exclusively composed of female musicians. This is distinct from a girl group, in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed. While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop scenes, all-female bands are less common.

==1920s–1950s==
In the Jazz Age and during the 1930s, &quot;all-girl&quot; bands such as the Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin&#x27;s All-Girl Band, the Ingenues, the Harlem Playgirls led by the likes of Neliska Ann Briscoe and Eddie Crump, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, Phil Spitalny&#x27;s Musical Sweethearts, &quot;Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators&quot; as well as &quot;Helen Lewis and her Rhythm Queens were popular. Dozens of early sound films were made of the vaudeville style all-girl groups, especially short subject promotional films for Paramount and Vitaphone. (In 1925, Lee de Forest filmed Lewis and her band in his short-lived Phonofilm process, in a film now in the Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress.) Blanche Calloway, sister of Cab Calloway, led a male band, Blanche Calloway and Her Joy Boys, from 1932 to 1939, and Ina Ray Hutton led an all-girl band, the Melodears, from 1934 to 1939. Eunice Westmoreland, under the name Rita Rio, led an all-girl band appearing on NBC Radio and in short subjects for Vitaphone and RKO before changing her career to acting and her professional name to Dona Drake, appearing in numerous 1940s movies. Ivy Benson&#x27;s &quot;All Girls Band&quot; was the BBC&#x27;s resident dance band in 1943 and toured until the 1980s. All-girl bands active in vaudeville, variety shows, and early sound films during the 1920s to the 1950s are documented by Kristin McGee in &quot;Some Liked it Hot: Jazz Women in Film and Television&quot;. Sally Placksin, Linda Dahl, D. Antoinette Handy, and Frank Driggs along with professor Sherrie Tucker, in her book &quot;Swing Shift: &quot;All-Girl&quot; Bands of the 1940s&quot;, have also documented this era. A Polish group Filipinki was established in 1959.

==1960s==
Bands composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of rock and roll. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were Goldie and the Gingerbreads, to Atlantic Records in 1964, the Pleasure Seekers with Suzi Quatro to Hideout Records in 1964 and Mercury Records in 1968, the Feminine Complex to Athena Records in 1968, and Fanny (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when Mo Ostin signed them to Warner Bros. Records. There were also others, such as the Liverbirds (1962–1967), the Ace of Cups (1967), the Heart Beats (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970) which included the three members of the Deadly Nightshade.

From 1964 to 1968 the Pandoras was an all-girl band (one of the first) playing a few original tunes and a bunch of popular covers at concerts and dances throughout New England. They started out as a trio, with Simmons College students Kathy Kinsella and Pinky Keehner on rhythm guitar and lead guitar, and Sally Levy on drums. Much later, under the management guidance of Peter Bonfils, the band had some success, including a recording contract and a couple of singles with Liberty Records (&quot;About My Baby&quot;, b/w &quot;New Day,&quot; and &quot;Games&quot; b/w &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother&quot;), and gigs that showed all around the U.S. as well as in Newfoundland and Puerto Rico, opening for acts including the Kingsmen, Dionne Warwick, the Byrds, and Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys.

The Shaggs were an all-female family band who earned some regional notoriety during their time as a performing band in the late 1960s; by the time they had disbanded in 1975 their first album &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; had caught the attention of Frank Zappa and by 1980, NRBQ arranged for it to have a wide release. The Shaggs, particularly in their early years, were noted for their inability to adhere to basic norms of popular music (their drummer, Helen Wiggin, often found herself detached from the music her sisters Dot and Betty were singing and playing on guitar), which somewhat ironically (and to their bewilderment) made them icons of outsider music.

==1970s==

Roger Ebert, in his audio commentary for &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1970) gives the film credit for inspiring all-female rock bands, with the fictional band Carrie Nations created for the film, stating that such bands were quite rare at the time, but started to spring up in the film&#x27;s wake.

Fanny were the first all-female rock band to release an album on a major label. On November 6, 1971, Fanny became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100&#x27;s top 40, with &quot;Charity Ball&quot; peaking at No. 40.

In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, recorded the first of a string of albums, sometimes joined by their sister Jane. The Runaways were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976; band members Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, and Lita Ford all went on to solo careers.

In the United Kingdom, the advent of punk in the late 1970s with its &quot;anyone can do it&quot; ethos lead to the formation of such bands as the Slits, the Raincoats, Mo-dettes, Dolly Mixture, and the Innocents among others, and the formation of other groups where the female members influenced the music and lyrical content (Au Pairs, Delta 5) or were the featured artist within the ensemble, notably The Pretenders, Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex. The expansion of punk into Europe gave rise to Switzerland&#x27;s die Kleenex/LiLiPUT.

In Australia in 1977 all-girl band Sweet Jayne began doing regular gigs with the original lineup: Cris Bonacci, Chris Scheri, Robyn Clark and Sally Zylstra. Labelled &quot;Sweet and Heavy Rock&quot;, Sweet Jayne played mostly original material. Winning the Australasian Yamaha Battle of the Bands in 1978, Sweet Jayne went on through various cassette, vinyl and film clip releases and line up changes and played 700 gigs over 6 years. Sweet Jayne split up in 1983 when Chris Scheri (flute and vocals) and Cris Bonacci (guitar) were invited to the UK to work for Mike Oldfield.

The all-female heavy metal band Girlschool, from South London, formed in 1978. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, Kathy Valentine, departed to join the all-female band the Go-Go&#x27;s, switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool&#x27;s early recordings was an EP titled &quot;St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; which they recorded with Bronze label-mates Motörhead under the name Headgirl.

In 1974, the Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band (Anne Bowen, rhythm guitar/percussion; Pamela Robin Brandt, electric bass; Helen Hooke, lead guitar/violin) was signed by RCA&#x27;s custom label Phantom. The contract made RCA/Phantom the first mainstream record label to grant a band the right to reject any advertising offensive to feminist sensibilities. The band released two albums, &quot;The Deadly Nightshade&quot; in 1975 and &quot;F&amp;W (Funky &amp; Western)&quot; in 1976. Reunited in 2009, the Deadly Nightshade recorded and released a third album &quot;Never Never Gonna Stop&quot; in 2012 and they continually toured until Brandt&#x27;s death in 2015, dissolving the band.

==1980s and 1990s==

The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 year-end chart for 1982 Joan Jett&#x27;s &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; at No. 3 and the Go-Go&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; at No. 2 sent a strong message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money. While Joan Jett played &quot;no-frills, glam-rock anthems, sung with her tough-as-nails snarl and sneer&quot;, the Go-Go&#x27;s were seen as playful girls, an image that even &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine poked fun at when they put the band on their cover in their underwear along with the caption &quot;Go-Go&#x27;s Put out!&quot;. However musician magazines were starting to show respect to female musicians, putting Bonnie Raitt and Tina Weymouth on their covers. While the Go-Go&#x27;s and the Bangles, both from the L.A. club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians and allow them to be part of the recording process.

While the 1980s helped pave the way for female musicians to get taken more seriously it was still considered a novelty of sorts for several years, and it was very much a male-dominated world. In 1984, when film maker Dave Markey, along with Jeff and Steve McDonald from Redd Kross, put together the mockumentary &quot;Desperate Teenage Lovedolls&quot;, a comically punky version of &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;, it also spawned a real band. While the Lovedolls could barely play at first, because of the film, and because they were an &quot;all-female band&quot;, they received press and gigs.

Klymaxx became the first self-produced all-female band in the R&amp;B/pop style of music to play all instruments; several of their singles - including &quot;Meeting in the Ladies Room&quot; and &quot;I Miss You&quot; charted in both R&amp;B and pop countdowns.

Leading into the 1990s, the surge of heavy metal in the 1980s helped to shed another light on the role of females in music. Because of the success of the Go-Go&#x27;s and the Bangles many females were frustrated at not being taken seriously or only thought of as &quot;cute chicks playing music&quot; and either joined rock bands or formed all-female metal bands. One such band that was playing harder music in San Francisco was Rude Girl. Originally signed to CBS Records, the band splintered before an album would be released and the remaining members released a 12-inch single in 1987 under the name Malibu Barbi. When Cara Crash and Wanda Day left 4 Non Blondes and joined Malibu Barbi their sound shifted from heavy metal to a sound described as combining a &quot;driving beat with Johnny Rottenesque vocal and post-punk riffs&quot;. Around the same time in the Midwest, Madam X was signed to an offshoot of Columbia Records, Jet Records. In 1984, the Rick Derringer-produced album &quot;We Reserve the Right&quot; was released along with the single &quot;High in High School&quot;. The Petrucci sisters were a focal point of the band – Maxine, the lead guitarist, and Roxy, the drummer. However, based on management decisions, it was decided that it would be better if only one of the sisters was in the band and Roxy was placed in another band, the all-female, Los Angeles–based Vixen.

Vixen was founded also in the Midwest, but in St. Paul, Minnesota, by Jan Kuehnemund during the mid-1970s. Kuehnemund folded the band a few months later, when her bandmates either dropped out or joined other bands, and she reformed it after moving to L.A. at the start of the 1980s. Vixen was sometimes described as &quot;the female Bon Jovi&quot;, eventually becoming commercially successful due largely to the band&#x27;s signature hit &quot;Edge of a Broken Heart&quot; from their self-titled debut album, making Vixen erroneously a one-hit wonder, although their next hit, a cover of Jeff Paris&#x27;s &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, charted even higher in both Britain and the US. The band folded again in the early 1990s following musical differences, but reformed twice more in their history. Maxine Petrucci also joined Vixen, albeit as a touring bass guitarist, after her sister invited her in 1998 until the Petruccis and their fellow band members were forced to disperse when Kuehnemund, feeling left out and her lead in representing Vixen being usurped, successfully sued to keep the rights to her band&#x27;s name. She reunited Vixen in 2001, with a new bassist in tow, until disagreements with the band&#x27;s management caused Kuehnemund&#x27;s bandmates to leave, driving her to search for and hire new members. In 2004, Vixen&#x27;s line-up from the &quot;Vixen&quot; and &quot;Rev It Up&quot; era made a one-time appearance on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;, as its Canadian host has been a fan of the band. The line-up from 2001 recorded a fourth album, &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot;, released between 2006 and 2007. Kuehnemund died in 2013 and Vixen was reformed with three-quarters of the &quot;classic&quot; line-up plus Gina Stile, the lead guitarist from the &quot;Tangerine&quot; period, to honor her legacy. Both Stile and long-time frontwoman/rhythm guitarist Janet Gardner have left the band by the end of the 2010s.

With the resurgence of interest in pop-punk bands in the US in the early 1990s, along with the sunset strip &quot;hair metal&quot; scene becoming extremely crowded, bands who combined a &quot;non-image&quot; with loud raw music started were gigging at clubs like Rajis in Hollywood. Bands such as Hole, Super Heroines, the Lovedolls, and L7 became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident &quot;bad girl&quot; attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. Courtney Love described the other females in Hole as using a more &quot;lunar viewpoint&quot; in their roles as musicians. In the 1990s, riot grrrl became the genre associated with bands such as Bratmobile and Bikini Kill. Other punk bands, such as Spitboy, have been less comfortable with the childhood-centered issues of much of the riot grrrl aesthetic, but nonetheless also have dealt explicitly with feminist and related issues. All-female Queercore bands, such as Fifth Column, Tribe 8, and Team Dresch, also write songs dealing with matters specific to women and their position in society. A film put together by a San Diego psychiatrist, Dr. Lisa Rose Apramian, along with the former drummer from the Motels and the Droogs, Kyle C. Kyle, the documentary &quot;Not Bad for a Girl&quot; explored some of these issues with interviews from many of the female musicians on the riot grrrl scene at the time.

In contemporary Christian music history, there was the first all-female Christian rock band Rachel Rachel, which existed only during the early 1990s and who performed in an album-oriented rock style. Jennifer York became the first woman to establish a Christian band, specifically an all-female group. Even though Rachel Rachel&#x27;s success was short lived when they folded due to &quot;creative differences&quot; and too great a geographic distance, future rock bands or non-rock musical groups in the Christian genre that have only women as members followed their lead in the next decades to come.

Many female musicians from all-female bands in the 1980s and 1990s have gone on to more high-profile gigs. The Pandoras&#x27; former members include members of the Muffs; Leather Leone, the singer from Rude Girl and Malibu Barbi, went on to sing for Chastain; Warbride&#x27;s founder and lead guitarist, Lori Linstruth joined Arjen Lucassen; Abby Travis from the Lovedolls has played with Beck, Elastica, and Bangles; Meredith Brooks, from the Graces, went on to solo success and Janet Robin, from Precious Metal, was the touring guitarist for Brooks as well as Lindsey Buckingham and Air Supply. Sweet Jayne&#x27;s Cris Bonacci became Girlschool&#x27;s lead guitarist in 1985 and stayed with the band for fewer than 10 years. Girlschool, despite numerous line-up changes, have never broke up despite a brief hiatus and celebrated their 40th anniversary in 2018.

==2000s and 2010s==

In Japan, the 2010s brought a boom of all-female heavy metal bands forming and gaining mainstream attention. Although considered pioneers as the first to form in 2007, Destrose never achieved commercial success. Aldious have been cited as the initiators of the movement when their first album &quot;Deep Exceed&quot; (2010) topped the Oricon Indies Albums Chart and reached number 15 on the main chart. Another notable girls metal band is Cyntia, who are believed to have been the first of the movement to join a major record label when they signed to Victor Entertainment in 2013. Other bands include Mary&#x27;s Blood, Fate Gear, and Lovebites, the last of which won the 2018 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best New Band. Another example of all-female band is the Brazilian death metal band Crypta, formed 2019 in São Paulo. They released their first album titled &quot;Echoes of The Soul&quot; through Napalm Records in 2021. Crypta performed at the Wacken Open Air 2022 festival.

In the 2010s, some groups that would typically fit the description of an all-female band began expressing their ambivalence towards the term, and similar terms such as &quot;girl band&quot; or &quot;female-fronted band&quot;. Female musicians have written about the gendered double standard behind such descriptors, pointing out how seldom the term &quot;all-male band&quot; is used, and that a society with gender equality would not describe types of musical groups based on the gender of their members. Prominent bands who have adopted this viewpoint include American pop rock trio Haim, and Australian alternative rock trio Camp Cope.

==Outside pop music==
All-female bands are not restricted to the mainstream genres. The British/Australian string quartet Bond play classical crossover (first and second violin, viola, and cello) and sing the occasional vocals that accompany some of their tracks. Many bands across many genres are all-female, such as the psychedelic folk group Spires That in the Sunset Rise.

<text>The Japan Mennonite Brethren Conference, or 日本メノナイトブレザレン教団 Nihon Menonaito Burezaren Kyoudan, is an organization serving the &quot;Mennonite Brethren&quot; churches of Japan.

&quot;Mennonite Brethren&quot; in Japan began as a mission work of the Board of Foreign Missions of the &quot;General Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches&quot; (now the US Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches and the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches). Plans for mission work in Japan were initiated in 1948, and the first missionary arrived in August 1950. The &quot;Mennonite Brethren&quot; mission work centered on the Osaka and Kobe area. Since then over 30 Mennonite Brethren missionaries have served in Japan. The first church service took place in May 1951, and the first baptism was in August of that same year. The work grew and the &quot;Nihon Menonaito Burezaren Kyoudan&quot; was founded in 1964. 

In April 2015 the Japan Mennonite Brethren Conference celebrated the 65th anniversary of its origins. In 2018 the Conference reported 1776 members in 29 congregations. 

Services provided by the &quot;Japan Mennonite Brethren Conference&quot; include theological direction through its Board of Faith and Life, Church Education Ministries, an Evangelism Committee, Overseas Missions Committee, and Publications Committee. The Nosegawa Bible Camp is located in the north part of Osaka, Japan, near the Inagawa River. The &quot;Japan Mennonite Brethren Conference&quot; operates the &quot;Evangelical Biblical Seminary&quot; (founded as the &quot;Osaka Biblical Seminary&quot; in 1965 by the &quot;Mennonite Brethren&quot; and two Baptist groups) at Ikeda, Osaka. &quot;Yoki Otozure&quot; is the conference periodical.

<text>The Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph), also known as the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (Sgr dE or Sag DEG), is an elliptical loop-shaped satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. It contains four globular clusters in its main body, with the brightest of them — NGC 6715 (M54) — known well before the discovery of the galaxy itself in 1994. Sgr dSph is roughly 10,000 light-years in diameter, and is currently about 70,000 light-years from Earth, travelling in a polar orbit (an orbit passing over the Milky Way&#x27;s galactic poles) at a distance of about 50,000 light-years from the core of the Milky Way (about one third of the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud). In its looping, spiraling path, it has passed through the plane of the Milky Way several times in the past. In 2018, the Gaia project of the European Space Agency showed that Sgr dSph had caused perturbations in a set of stars near the Milky Way&#x27;s core, causing unexpected rippling movements of the stars triggered when it moved through the Milky Way between 300 and 900 million years ago.

==Features==
Officially discovered in 1994, by Rodrigo Ibata, Mike Irwin, and Gerry Gilmore, Sgr dSph was immediately recognized as being the nearest known neighbor to the Milky Way at the time. (The disputed Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, discovered in 2003, might be the actual nearest neighbor.) Although it is one of the closest companion galaxies to the Milky Way, the main parent cluster is on the opposite side of the Galactic Center from Earth, and consequently is very faint, although covering a large area of the sky. Sgr dSph appears to be an older galaxy with little interstellar dust, composed largely of Population II stars, older and metal-poor, as compared to the Milky Way. No neutral hydrogen gas related to Sgr dSph has been found.

Further discoveries by astrophysics teams from both the University of Virginia and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, drawing upon the 2MASS Two-Micron All Sky Infrared Survey data, revealed the entire loop-shaped structure. In 2003 with the aid of infrared telescopes and super computers, Steven Majewski, Michael Skrutskie, and Martin Weinberg were able to help create a new star map, picking out the full Sagittarius Dwarf presence, position, and looping shape from the mass of background stars and finding this smaller galaxy to be at a near right angle to the plane of the Milky Way.

===Globular clusters===

Sgr dSph has at least nine known globular clusters. One, M 54, appears to reside at its core, while three others reside within the main body of the galaxy: Terzan 7, Terzan 8 and Arp 2.
Additionally, Palomar 12, Whiting 1, NGC 2419, NGC 4147, and NGC 5634 are found within its extended stellar streams. However, this is an unusually low number of globular clusters, and an analysis of VVV and Gaia EDR3 data has found at least twenty more. The newly discovered globular clusters tend to be more metal-rich than previously known globular clusters.

===Metallicity===
Sgr dSph has multiple stellar populations, ranging in age from the oldest globular clusters (almost as old as the universe itself) to trace populations as young as several hundred million years (mya). It also exhibits an age-metallicity relationship, in that its old populations are metal poor () while its youngest populations have super-solar abundances.

==Geometry and dynamics==
Based on its current trajectory, the Sgr dSph main cluster is about to pass through the galactic disc of the Milky Way within the next hundred million years, while the extended loop-shaped ellipse is already extended around and through our local space and on through the Milky Way galactic disc, and in the process of slowly being absorbed into the larger galaxy, calculated at 10,000 times the mass of Sgr dSph. The dissipation of the Sgr dSph main cluster and its merger with the Milky Way stream is expected to be complete within a billion years from now.

At first, many astronomers thought that Sgr dSph had already reached an advanced state of destruction, so that a large part of its original matter was already mixed with that of the Milky Way. However, Sgr dSph still has coherence as a dispersed elongated ellipse, and appears to move in a roughly polar orbit around the Milky Way as close as 50,000 light-years from the galactic core. Although it may have begun as a spherical object before falling towards the Milky Way, Sgr dSph is now being torn apart by immense tidal forces over hundreds of millions of years. Numerical simulations suggest that stars ripped out from the dwarf would be spread out in a long stellar stream along its path, which were subsequently detected.

However, some astronomers contend that Sgr dSph has been in orbit around the Milky Way for some billions of years, and has already orbited it approximately ten times. Its ability to retain some coherence despite such strains would indicate an unusually high concentration of dark matter within that galaxy.

In 1999, Johnston et al. concluded that Sgr dSph has orbited the Milky Way for at least one gigayear and that during that time its mass has decreased by a factor of two or three. Its orbit is found to have galactocentric distances that oscillate between ≈13 and ≈41 kpc with a period of 550 to 750 million years. The last perigalacticon was approximately fifty million years ago. Also in 1999, Jiang &amp; Binney found that it may have started its infall into the Milky Way at a point more than 200 kpc away if its starting mass was as large as ≈1011.

The models of both its orbit and the Milky Way&#x27;s potential field could be improved by proper motion observations of Sgr dSph&#x27;s stellar debris. This issue is under intense investigation, with computational support by the MilkyWay@Home project.

A simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have obtained its spiral structure as a result of repeated collisions with Sgr dSph.

In 2018, the Gaia project of the European Space Agency, designed primarily to investigate the origin, evolution and structure of the Milky Way, delivered the largest and most precise census of positions, velocities and other stellar properties of more than a billion stars, which showed that Sgr dSph had caused perturbations in a set of stars near the Milky Way&#x27;s core, causing unexpected rippling movements of the stars triggered when it sailed past the Milky Way between 300 and 900 million years ago.

A 2019 study by TCU Graduate Student Matthew Melendez and co-authors concluded that Sgr dSph had a decreasing metallicity trend as a function of radius, with a larger spread in metallicity in the core relative to the outer regions. Also, they did find evidence for the first time for two distinct populations in alpha abundances as a function of metallicity.

A 2020 study concluded that collisions between the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy and the Milky Way triggered major episodes of star formation in the latter, based on data taken from the Gaia project.

<text>Herbert Wayne &quot;Herb&quot; Boyer (born July 10, 1936) is an American biotechnologist, researcher and entrepreneur in biotechnology. Along with Stanley N. Cohen and Paul Berg, he discovered recombinant DNA, a method to coax bacteria into producing foreign proteins, which aided in jump-starting the field of genetic engineering. By 1969, he had performed studies on a couple of restriction enzymes of &quot;E. coli&quot; with especially useful properties.

He is recipient of the 1990 National Medal of Science, co-recipient of the 1996 Lemelson–MIT Prize, and a co-founder of Genentech. He was professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and later served as vice president of Genentech from 1976 until his retirement in 1991.

==Early life and education==
Herbert Boyer was born in 1936 in Derry, Pennsylvania. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology and chemistry from Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in 1958. He married his wife Grace the following year. He received his PhD at the University of Pittsburgh in 1963 and participated as an activist in the civil rights movement. 

==Career==
Boyer spent three years in postdoctoral work at Yale University in the laboratories of Professors Edward Adelberg and Bruce Carlton, and then became an assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco and a professor of biochemistry from 1976 to 1991, where he discovered that genes from bacteria could be combined with genes from eukaryotes. In 1977, Boyer&#x27;s laboratory and collaborators Keiichi Itakura and Arthur Riggs at City of Hope National Medical Center described the first-ever synthesis and expression of a peptide-coding gene. In August 1978, he produced synthetic insulin using his new transgenic genetically modified bacteria, followed in 1979 by a growth hormone.

In 1976, Boyer founded Genentech with venture capitalist Robert A. Swanson. Genentech&#x27;s approach to the first synthesis of insulin won out over Walter Gilbert&#x27;s approach at Biogen which used whole genes from natural sources. Boyer built his gene from its individual nucleotides.

In 1990, Boyer and his wife Grace gave the single largest donation ($10,000,000) bestowed on the Yale School of Medicine by an individual. The Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine was named after the Boyer family in 1991.

At the Class of 2007 Commencement, St. Vincent College announced that they had renamed the School of Natural Science, Mathematics, and Computing the Herbert W. Boyer School.

Among his professional activities, Boyer is on the board of directors of Scripps Research.

<text>STS-41-B was NASA&#x27;s tenth Space Shuttle mission and the fourth flight of the . It launched on February 3, 1984 and landed on February 11, 1984, after deploying two communications satellites. It was also notable for including the first untethered spacewalk.

Following STS-9, the flight numbering system for the Space Shuttle program was changed. Because the original successor to STS-9, STS-10, was canceled due to payload delays, the next flight, originally and internally designated STS-11, became STS-41-B as part of the new numbering system.

== Mission summary ==



=== Crew ===
The STS-41-B crew included commander Vance D. Brand, making his second Shuttle flight; pilot Robert L. Gibson; and mission specialists Bruce McCandless II, Ronald E. McNair, and Robert L. Stewart.

=== Launch and satellite deployment ===
&quot;Challenger&quot; lifted off from Kennedy Space Center at 08:00:00 a.m. EST on February 3, 1984. It was estimated that 100,000 people attended the launch. Two communications satellites were deployed about 8 hours after launch; one, Westar 6, was for America&#x27;s Western Union, and the other, Palapa B2, for Indonesia; both were Hughes-built HS-376-series satellites. However, the Payload Assist Modules (PAM) for both satellites malfunctioned, placing them into a lower-than-planned orbit. Both satellites were retrieved successfully in November 1984 during STS-51-A, which was conducted by the orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;.

=== Untethered EVA ===
On February 7, the fourth day of the mission, astronauts McCandless and Stewart performed the first untethered spacewalk, operating the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) for the first time. At 8:25 a.m. EST, pulsing the MMU&#x27;s thrusters, McCandless ventured out of &quot;Challenger&quot;″s payload bay, and reached from the orbiter. Stewart tested the &quot;work station&quot; foot restraint at the end of the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm). On the seventh day of the mission, both astronauts performed another extravehicular activity (EVA) to practice capture procedures for the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite retrieval and repair operation, which was planned for the next mission, STS-41-C.

=== Scientific experiments ===
STS-41-B also achieved the reflight of the West German-sponsored SPAS-1 pallet/satellite, which had originally flown on STS-7. This time, however, it remained in the payload bay due to an electrical problem in the RMS (Canadarm). The mission also carried five Get Away Special (GAS) canisters, six live rats in the middeck area, a Cinema-360 camera and a continuation of the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System and Monodisperse Latex Reactor experiments. Included in one of the GAS canisters was the first experiment designed and built by a high school team to fly in space. The experiment, on seed germination and growth in zero gravity, was created and built by a team of four students from Brighton High School in Utah through a partnership with Utah State University.
=== Issues with the orbiter ===
During the mission, the nozzles of &quot;Challenger&quot;″s supply and wastewater venting systems experienced below-freezing temperatures; subsequently, the supply water dump valve failed to open, so excess water was dumped through the flash evaporator for the remainder of the mission. During re-entry, ice from the dump valves broke off their nozzles situated near the nose of the orbiter and struck the left Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pod, damaging three Thermal Protection System (TPS) tiles and leading to a burn-through, but the damage was minimal enough that &quot;Challenger&quot; and its crew were unharmed. During the post-flight inspection it was found that the dump line upstream of the two nozzles had ruptured due to the wastewater expanding as it froze, and insulation was missing around both nozzles. The TPS tiles near the nozzles were also discolored, indicating ice had built up prior to re-entry.

=== Return to Earth ===
The 7 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes, and 55 seconds flight ended on February 11, 1984 with a successful landing at Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility. This marked the first landing of a spacecraft at its launch site. &quot;Challenger&quot; completed 128 orbits and traveled .

== Mission insignia ==
Designed by artist Robert McCall, the eleven stars in the blue field symbolize the mission&#x27;s original designation as STS-11. The left panel shows the deployment of a satellite, and the right panel shows an astronaut using the MMU.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

== After the mission ==
Astronaut Bruce McCandless II sued singer Dido in 2010 over the use of a public domain photo of him in space on this mission on her 2008 album &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot;.

Two years after this mission, Ronald E. McNair was a crew member of the ill-fated STS-51-L. He and his six colleagues were killed when &quot;Challenger&quot; disintegrated above the Atlantic Ocean 73 seconds after liftoff.

<doc id="428068" wikidata="Q1085692" url="?curid=428068" title="Kaskaskia">
<text>The Kaskaskia were one of the indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands. They were one of about a dozen cognate tribes that made up the Illiniwek Confederation, also called the Illinois Confederation. Their longstanding homeland was in the Great Lakes region. Their first contact with Europeans reportedly occurred near present-day Green Bay, Wisconsin, in 1667 at a Jesuit mission station.

==Post-contact history==

===European explorers===

In 1673, Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette and French-Canadian explorer Louis Jolliet became the first Europeans known to have descended the Mississippi River. The record of their trip is the earliest, best record of contact between Europeans and the Illinois Indians. Marquette and Jolliet, with five other men, left the mission of St. Ignace at Michilimackinac in two bark canoes on May 17. To reach the Mississippi River, they travelled across Lake Michigan into Green Bay, up the Fox River and down the Wisconsin River. Descending the Mississippi, in June, they met the Peoria and Moingwena bands of Illinois at the Haas/Hagerman Site near the mouth of the Des Moines River in Clark County, northeastern Missouri. They met another Illinois band, the Michigamea, when they reached present-day Arkansas.

They began their return trip from the Michigamea village about July 17, following the Illinois River eastward to Lake Michigan rather than taking the more northern route along the Wisconsin River. Near modern Utica in LaSalle County, Illinois, across from Starved Rock, they met the Kaskaskia at the Grand Village of the Illinois (now a State Historic Site, also known as the Zimmerman site). The land controlled by the allied Illinois groups extended north from modern Arkansas, through Eastern Missouri and most of Illinois, and west into Iowa, where Des Moines was named after the Moingwena.

===New France missions===
In 1703, the French established a permanent mission, settlement and fort (Fort Kaskaskia State Historic Site) at Kaskaskia, Illinois, a part of their New France colonization of North America., which was part of the French Illinois Country, later made part of French Louisiana (New France).

French settlers moved in to farm and to exploit the lead mines on the Missouri side of the river. Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana, and a larger Fort de Chartres was built in 1718, nearby North close to Prairie du Rocher. In the same year, the French imported African slaves from Saint-Domingue (Santo Domingo) to work in the lead mines. From its beginning, Kaskaskia was a French/Native American settlement, consisting of a few French men and numerous Kaskaskia and other Illinois Indians.

In 1707, the population of the community was estimated at 2,200, the majority of them Illinois Indians who lived somewhat apart. A visitor, writing of Kaskaskia about 1715, said that the village consisted of 400 Illinois men, &quot;very good people,&quot; two Jesuit missionaries, and &quot;about twenty French &quot;voyageurs&quot; who have settled there and married Indian women.&quot; Of 21 children whose birth and baptism was recorded in Kaskaskia before 1714, 18 mothers were Indian and 20 fathers were French. The offspring of these mixed marriages could become either French or Indian. Because Indian communities were larger and more complete, they tended to be reared with their mothers and their people and culture. One devout Roman Catholic full-blooded Indian woman disowned her half-breed son for living &quot;among the savage nations.&quot; The settlement of Kaskaskia thus had a large population of mixed French and Indigenous ancestry, many of whom worked for fur companies based out of St. Louis, Missouri (a city created later, in 1764, by French traders and settlers who came from New Orleans).

===French and Indian War===

Male descendants of the French, Indians, and mixed bloods at Kaskaskia became the &quot;voyageurs&quot; and &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; who would explore and exploit the Missouri River country. The French wanted to trade with all the prairie tribes, and beyond with the Spanish colony in New Mexico; the Spanish were alarmed at their commercial reach. French goals stimulated the expedition of Claude Charles Du Tisne to establish trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719. The fate of the Kaskaskia, and the rest of the Illiniwek/Illinois, was irrevocably tied up with that of France. Until their dissolution in France, French Jesuits built missions and ministered to the Kaskaskia. By 1763 and the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War in North America (called the French and Indian War in the United States), the Kaskaskia and other Illinois tribes were greatly in decline. Early French explorers had estimated their original population from 6,000 to more than 20,000. By the end of the war, their numbers were a fraction of that. Contemporary historians believe the greatest fatalities during this period were due to new infectious diseases, to which the Native Americans had no immunity.

==Decline==
The causes of decline are many and varied. The Illinois made war with their French allies against the most formidable native nations: to the east, the Iroquois; to the northwest, the Sioux and the Fox; to the south, the Quapaw, Chickasaw and Cherokee; to the west, the Osage Nation. Added to combat losses were the great losses due to epidemics of European diseases. In 1769, a Peoria warrior killed Pontiac, which brought the wrath of the Great Lakes tribes against the Kaskaskia and other Illinois tribes. (Some historians question this legendary retaliation; see the article on Pontiac.) The Ottawa, Sauk, Fox, Miami, Kickapoo and Potawatomi devastated the Illiniwek and occupied their old tribal range along the Illinois River.

In 1766, the British arrived and established a small detachment from Fort de Chartres at Kaskaskia. From 1766 through 1772, this rotating detachment was around 25 men under a junior officer, detached from Fort de Chartres. In May 1772, when the British abandoned Fort de Chartres, the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot, left a small detachment of four officers and 50 men at Kaskaskia as an effort to retain British control over the Illinois Country. Captain Hugh Lord, of the 18th Foot, was the last British commander in Illinois. The detachment of the 18th Foot was ordered to Detroit in May 1776 and never returned to Illinois. Lord&#x27;s detachment was garrisoned in the former Jesuit compound at Kaskaskia. The post was called Fort Gage only after Fort de Chartres was abandoned in 1772.

On July 4, 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, George Rogers Clark captured the town and Fort Gage.

End April 1824, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, French hero of the American Revolutionary War, visited Kaskaskia during his grand tour of the United States, just after having visited Saint Louis (Missouri) (Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States), as a salute to two towns which were part of the former French Louisiana which was acquired by the United States in 1803.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Kaskaskia&#x27; derives from the old Miami-Illinois word for a katydid, phonetically . This name later appeared in the modern Peoria and Miami dialects as . This is already seen in Gravier&#x27;s early-18th century Illinois dictionary, where for the word &quot;caskaskia&quot;, he gives &quot;cigale. item nation Ilinoise, les Kaskaskias&quot;.

==Today==

<doc id="428069" wikidata="Q475227" url="?curid=428069" title="The Jesus Lizard">
<text>The Jesus Lizard is an American rock band formed in 1987 in Austin, Texas by vocalist David Yow, guitarist Duane Denison and bassist David Wm. Sims. They relocated to Chicago, Illinois, in 1989, where they found kindred spirits in recording engineer Steve Albini and Touch and Go Records. With the addition of drummer Mac McNeilly, they began performing live, eventually attracting an international audience with their powerful live show. 

The Jesus Lizard were &quot;a leading noise rock band in the American independent underground…[who] turned out a series of independent records filled with scathing, disembowelling, guitar-driven pseudo-industrial noise.&quot; The albums &quot;Goat&quot; (1991) and &quot;Liar&quot; (1992) have since been recognized as two of the most significant noise rock albums of their decade.

Drummer Jim Kimball replaced McNeilly late in 1996, and was himself replaced by Brendan Murphy two years later, with McNeilly returning to drums for their reunion shows years later. Despite releasing a split single with leading alt-rockers Nirvana and signing to Capitol Records, the band failed to find commercial success amid the alternative rock explosion of the 1990s and disbanded in 1999. Their reunion tour ten years later garnered positive responses from audiences and critics. The band performed another reunion tour in 2017 and 2019.

==History==
===Formation and Touch &amp; Go years (1987–1994)===
The band began in Austin, Texas, when guitarist Duane Denison asked David Yow, formerly of Scratch Acid, to play bass on some songs he wanted to record. Yow suggested that he sing and have former Scratch Acid bassist David Wm. Sims play bass instead. The resultant group took its name from a common nickname for the basilisk, a type of lizard that can run on water. The trio rehearsed several times in Austin with a drum machine. Yow and Sims moved to Chicago in 1988, and Denison followed the next year.

Their first EP, &quot;Pure&quot;, was recorded by Albini and released by Touch &amp; Go in 1989. It is the only record by the band that uses a drum machine. Drummer Mac McNeilly, formerly of Phantom 309, was recruited and the band played its first live show on July 1, 1989. Albini recorded the band&#x27;s next four albums – &quot;Head&quot; (1990), &quot;Goat&quot; (1991), &quot;Liar&quot; (1992), and &quot;Down&quot; (1994). During this era the group also released a live record, &quot;Show&quot;, and a split single with Nirvana, &quot;Puss/Oh, the Guilt&quot;.

===Capitol years and breakup (1995–1999)===

The band signed to Capitol Records in 1995, recording the song &quot;Panic in Cicero&quot; for the &quot;Clerks&quot; soundtrack and making appearances at Lollapalooza shortly thereafter. Impressed by his work on The Melvins&#x27; &quot;Stoner Witch&quot; album, the band hired producer Garth Richardson to record their next record, &quot;Shot&quot;, the following year. While rumors that Albini refused to work with the band due to their involvement with a major label persisted, both Albini and the group have stated this to be false.

McNeilly left the band in late 1996, citing exhaustion from touring and the desire to spend more time with his family. He was replaced by Jim Kimball, of Mule and Denison&#x27;s side project, The Denison/Kimball Trio.

After more heavy touring the following year, this lineup recorded 1998&#x27;s self-titled EP, their only record whose title is not a four-letter word, on Jetset Records. The EP featured production and engineering by Andy Gill of Gang of Four, John Cale, and Jim O&#x27;Rourke. Later that year, the band released the album &quot;Blue&quot;, also recorded by Gill. A departure, the record explored their experimental instincts previously hinted at on earlier songs like &quot;Happy Bunny Goes Fluff-Fluff Along&quot; and &quot;White Hole&quot;.

In August 1998 Kimball left the group and was replaced by Chicago-based drummer Brendan Murphy, formerly of the Wesley Willis Fiasco. They embarked on several more months of heavy touring, playing the final gig of their initial career at the Umeå Open festival in Umeå, Sweden, on March 27, 1999. After being dropped from Capitol Records mid-contract, the band announced its split the following June.

===Post-breakup (2000–2007)===
In 2000, Touch &amp; Go issued &quot;Bang&quot;, a CD of 7&quot; tracks and rarities. The members remained musically active: Denison began performing with Tomahawk, continued to play with Kimball in The Denison/Kimball Trio, and backed Hank Williams III on tour. In 2006, he also formed U.S.S.A. with bassist Paul Barker (ex-Ministry). McNeilly played drums in P.W. Long&#x27;s Reelfoot recording &quot;Push Me Again&quot;, and continued to play along with his wife in their band Mouse. He recorded with Steve Albini in February 2007 for Denison&#x27;s Fuzz label mate Greg Garing.

In 2006, Yow and Sims reformed Scratch Acid, along with original members Rey Washam (also of Rapeman, Ministry) and Brett Bradford (also of Sangre de Toro) for the Touch &amp; Go Records 25th Anniversary Festival in Chicago. A week before the Touch &amp; Go Festival, the reunited Scratch Acid played to a sold-out crowd at Emo&#x27;s in their hometown of Austin. Sims relocated to New York City, began working as an accountant, and maintained his solo project Dangerpuss. Denison relocated to Nashville. Yow moved to Los Angeles, working in graphic design for an advertising agency and joining the band Qui, before pursuing an acting career and briefly joining Flipper on vocals.

===Reunion tour (2008–2010)===
The Jesus Lizard reformed in 2008 with McNeilly drumming, and began playing concerts the next year. These shows included appearances at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, and All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festivals in England and New York. On October 6, all of the band&#x27;s Touch &amp; Go studio albums were re-released with improved sound and bonus tracks. The albums were remastered by Albini and Bob Weston and packaged with new liner notes and gatefold artwork. Following the tour, the individual members returned to other projects and stated that this run of activity was &quot;probably [their] last.&quot;

===Post-reunion tour (2010–2016)===
In August 2011 MVD released &quot;Club&quot;, a concert DVD and double LP of the band&#x27;s Nashville performance at Exit/In from the 2009 tour.

In 2013, Yow released &quot;Tonight You Look Like a Spider&quot;, a solo album that had been in production for almost 15 years on Joyful Noise Recordings. The album was released in a limited edition, where the vinyl album was delivered inside of a concrete monolith, instead of a normal record sleeve. Yow stated that he&#x27;d been inspired to do the album by Mike Patton, and described his compositional process by stating, &quot;I rented a saxophone for 2 months, I borrowed some guitars and some drums, I rummaged through the kitchen, I squeezed a fat cat, I poked and prodded and ended up with my very own music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the Jesus Lizard was set to play at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties event Release the Bats in Melbourne, Australia. They canceled this show due to &#x27;unforeseen circumstances&#x27;.

===Second reunion (2017–present)===
In September 2017, the band announced their second reunion. The band undertook their first tour in eight years that December. They went on a tour in September 2018 and would play Riot Fest 2018 in Chicago that same month. In June 2024, The Jesus Lizard announced their first album in 26 years, revealing the title to be &quot;Rack&quot;, simultaneously releasing the first single, &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, to streaming platforms. The album was released on September 13 through Ipecac Recordings.

==Sound and influence==
Jesus Lizard&#x27;s sound, with its scathing mix of piercing guitar, machine-like drums, propulsive bass guitar, and deranged vocals, has often been classified as noise rock. The band has rejected this label, however, with Mac McNeilly stating that, &quot;I do not think we ever looked at ourselves that way, though. Rather, we were a band that played rock music under the big umbrella of rock.&quot; David Yow has described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;four white guys who liked to play a cross between Led Zeppelin and the Birthday Party.&quot;

Duane Denison&#x27;s playing is influenced by British guitarists such as John McGeoch from Siouxsie and the Banshees and Magazine for his work on &quot;Juju&quot; in particular, Andy Gill from Gang of Four, Geordie Walker from Killing Joke, Keith Levene from Public Image Ltd, and bands of the US underground scenes like Black Flag, Hüsker Dü, Butthole Surfers and Big Black. Denison said that he wanted to mix &quot;the post-punk, minimalist thing with the more, ... esoteric, porgy vibe.&quot; 

Albini typically kept vocals &quot;low in the mix,&quot; or much less prominent than was typical of rock and roll recordings. In &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;, Michael Azerrad writes that &quot;on the Jesus Lizard albums Albini recorded, singer David Yow sounds like a kidnap victim trying to howl through the duct tape over his mouth; the effect is horrific.&quot; David Sprague suggests that &quot;Yow&#x27;s disjointed couplets&quot; are reminiscent of a &quot;preacher speaking in tongues.&quot; Yow doesn&#x27;t consider himself a singer in the usual sense, but rather, thinks of himself as a vocal stylist. While appreciated as a unique vocalist, Yow was more often cited for his confrontational antics on-stage, often leaping into the crowd or taking off his clothes. He was also known to lick members of the crowd while climbing all over them and sometimes striking up conversation mid-song.

==Legacy==
The band have been cited as an influence or as a favorite by acts including Nirvana, OK Go frontman Damian Kulash, Gouge Away, KEN Mode, Bill Kelliher of Mastodon, Whores, Botch, Converge, Brand New, Chat Pile, METZ, Alexis Marshall of Daughters, Sara Lund of Unwound, Jim Suptic of The Get Up Kids, Jawbreaker, Johnny Temple of Girls Against Boys, Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit, Red Fang, Joe Lally of Fugazi, Henry Rollins, Helmet, and Lydia Lunch. 

Albini described them as &quot;the best band of the 90s, hands down ... They were a great band and they changed music for the better. Their music was more rigorous and more adventurous than all their peers, and they worked their asses off.&quot; However, he criticized their decision to sign to Capitol, a major label, saying it doomed them to &quot;become a third-string act for a big corporation that didn&#x27;t give a shit about them or their audience&quot;.

<doc id="428075" wikidata="Q5883" url="?curid=428075" title="Orb-weaver spider">
<text>Orb-weaver spiders are members of the spider family Araneidae. They are the most common group of builders of spiral wheel-shaped webs often found in gardens, fields, and forests. The English word &quot;orb&quot; can mean &quot;circular&quot;, hence the English name of the group. Araneids have eight similar eyes, hairy or spiny legs, and no stridulating organs.

The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, including many well-known large or brightly colored garden spiders. With 3,108 species in 186 genera worldwide, the Araneidae comprise one of the largest family of spiders (with the Salticidae and Linyphiidae). Araneid webs are constructed in a stereotypical fashion, where a framework of nonsticky silk is built up before the spider adds a final spiral of silk covered in sticky droplets.

Orb webs are also produced by members of other spider families. The long-jawed orb weavers (Tetragnathidae) were formerly included in the Araneidae; they are closely related, being part of the superfamily Araneoidea. The family Arkyidae has been split off from the Araneidae. The cribellate or hackled orb-weavers (Uloboridae) belong to a different group of spiders. Their webs are strikingly similar, but use a different kind of silk.

==Description==



Generally, orb-weaving spiders are three-clawed builders of flat webs with sticky spiral capture silk. The building of a web is an engineering feat, begun when the spider floats a line on the wind to another surface. The spider secures the line and then drops another line from the center, making a &quot;Y&quot;. The rest of the scaffolding follows with many radii of nonsticky silk being constructed before a final spiral of sticky capture silk.

The third claw is used to walk on the nonsticky part of the web. Characteristically, the prey insect that blunders into the sticky lines is stunned by a quick bite, and then wrapped in silk. If the prey is a venomous insect, such as a wasp, wrapping may precede biting and/or stinging. Much of the orb-spinning spiders&#x27; success in capturing insects depends on the web not being visible to the prey, with the stickiness of the web increasing the visibility, thus decreasing the chances of capturing prey. This leads to a trade-off between the visibility of the web and the web&#x27;s prey-retention ability.

Many orb-weavers build a new web each day. Most orb-weavers tend to be active during the evening hours; they hide for most of the day. Generally, towards evening, the spider consumes the old web, rests for about an hour, then spins a new web in the same general location. Thus, the webs of orb-weavers are generally free of the accumulation of detritus common to other species, such as black widow spiders.

Some orb-weavers do not build webs at all. Members of the genera &quot;Mastophora&quot; in the Americas, &quot;Cladomelea&quot; in Africa, and &quot;Ordgarius&quot; in Australia produce sticky globules, which contain a pheromone analog. The globule is hung from a silken thread dangled by the spider from its front legs. The pheromone analog attracts male moths of only a few species. These get stuck on the globule and are reeled in to be eaten. Both genera of bolas spiders are highly camouflaged and difficult to locate.

In the &quot;Araneus diadematus&quot;, variables such as wind, web support, temperatures, humidity, and silk supply all proved to be variables in web construction. When studied against the tests of nature, the spiders were able to decide what shape to make their web, how many capture spirals, or the width of their web. Though it could be expected for these spiders to just know these things, it is not well researched yet as to just how the arachnid knows how to change their web design based on their surroundings. Some scientists suggest that it could be through the spider&#x27;s spatial learning on their environmental surroundings and the knowing of what will or will not work compared to natural behavioristic rules.

The spiny orb-weaving spiders in the genera &quot;Gasteracantha&quot; and &quot;Micrathena&quot; look like plant seeds or thorns hanging in their orb-webs. Some species of &quot;Gasteracantha&quot; have very long, horn-like spines protruding from their abdomens.

One feature of the webs of some orb-weavers is the stabilimentum, a crisscross band of silk through the center of the web. It is found in several genera, but &quot;Argiope&quot; – the yellow and banded garden spiders of North America – is a prime example. As orb-weavers age, they tend to have less production of their silk; many adult orb-weavers can then depend on their coloration to attract more of their prey. The band may be a lure for prey, a marker to warn birds away from the web, and a camouflage for the spider when it sits in the web. The stabilimentum may decrease the visibility of the silk to insects, thus making it harder for prey to avoid the web. The orb-web consists of a frame and supporting radii overlaid with a sticky capture spiral, and the silks used by orb-weaver spiders have exceptional mechanical properties to withstand the impact of flying prey. The orb-weaving spider &quot;Zygiella x-notata&quot; produces a unique orb-web with a characteristic missing sector, similar to other species of the &quot;Zygiella&quot; genus in the Araneidae family.

During the Cretaceous, a radiation of flowering plants and their insect pollinators occurred. Fossil evidence shows that the orb web was in existence at this time, which permitted a concurrent radiation of the spider predators along with their insect prey. The capacity of orb–webs to absorb the impact of flying prey led orbicularian spiders to become the dominant predators of aerial insects in many ecosystems. Insects and spiders have comparable rates of diversification, suggesting they co-radiated, and the peak of this radiation occurred 100 Mya, before the origin of angiosperms. Vollrath and Selden (2007) make the bold proposition that insect evolution was driven less by flowering plants than by spider predation – particularly through orb webs – as a major selective force. On the other hand some analyses have yielded estimates as high as 265 Mya, with a large number (including Dimitrov et al 2016) intermediate between the two.

Most arachnid webs are vertical and the spiders usually hang with their heads downward. A few webs, such as those of orb-weavers in the genus &quot;Metepeira&quot;, have the orb hidden within a tangled space of web. Some &quot;Metepiera&quot; species are semisocial and live in communal webs. In Mexico, such communal webs have been cut out of trees or bushes and used for living fly paper. In 2009, workers at a Baltimore wastewater treatment plant called for help to deal with over 100 million orb-weaver spiders, living in a community that managed to spin a phenomenal web that covered some 4 acres of a building, with spider densities in some areas reaching 35,176 spiders per cubic meter.

== Taxonomy ==
The oldest known true orb-weaver is &quot;Mesozygiella dunlopi&quot;, from the Lower Cretaceous. Several fossils provide direct evidence that the three major orb-weaving families, namely the Araneidae, Tetragnathidae, and Uloboridae, had evolved by this time, about 140 Mya. They probably originated during the Jurassic (). Based on new molecular evidence in silk genes, all three families are likely to have a common origin.

The two superfamilies, Deinopoidea and Araneoidea, have similar behavioral sequences and spinning apparatuses to produce architecturally similar webs. The latter weave true viscid silk with an aqueous glue property, and the former use dry fibrils and sticky silk. The Deinopoidea (including the Uloboridae), have a cribellum – a flat, complex spinning plate from which the cribellate silk is released.

They also have a calamistrum – an apparatus of bristles used to comb the cribellate silk from the cribellum. The Araneoidea, or the &quot;ecribellate&quot; spiders, do not have these two structures. The two groups of orb-weaving spiders are morphologically very distinct, yet much similarity exists between their web forms and web construction behaviors. The cribellates retained the ancestral character, yet the cribellum was lost in the escribellates. The lack of a functional cribellum in araneoids is most likely synapomorphic.

If the orb-weaver spiders are a monophyletic group, the fact that only some species in the group lost a feature adds to the controversy. The cribellates are split off as a separate taxon that retained the primitive feature, which makes the lineage paraphyletic and not synonymous with any real evolutionary lineage. The morphological and behavioral evidence surrounding orb webs led to the disagreement over a single or a dual origin. While early molecular analysis provided more support for a monophyletic origin, other evidence indicates that orb-weavers evolved earlier phylogenetically than previously thought, and were extinct at least three times during the Cretaceous.

==Reproduction==
Araneid species either mate at the central hub of the web, where the male slowly traverses the web, trying not to get eaten, and when reaching the hub, mounts the female; or the male constructs a mating thread inside or outside the web to attract the female via vibratory courtship, and if successful, mating occurs on the thread.

In the cannibalistic and polyandrous orb-web spider &quot;Argiope bruennichi&quot;, the much smaller males are attacked during their first copulation and are cannibalized in up to 80% of the cases. All surviving males die after their second copulation, a pattern observed in other &quot;Argiope&quot; species. Whether a male survives his first copulation depends on the duration of the genital contact; males that jump off early (before 5 seconds) have a chance of surviving, while males that copulate longer (greater than 10 seconds) invariably die. Prolonged copulation, although associated with cannibalism, enhances sperm transfer and relative paternity.

When males mated with a nonsibling female, the duration of their copulation was prolonged, and consequently the males were cannibalized more frequently. When males mated with a sibling female, they copulated briefly, thus were more likely to escape cannibalism. By escaping, their chance of mating again with an unrelated female likely would be increased. These observations suggest that males can adaptively adjust their investment based on the degree of genetic relatedness of the female to avoid inbreeding depression.

=== Sexual size dimorphism ===
Sexual dimorphism refers to physical differences between males and females of the same species. One such difference can be in size.

Araneids often exhibit size dimorphism typically known as extreme sexual size dimorphism, due to the extent of differences in size. The size difference among species of Araneidae ranges greatly. Some females, such as those of the &quot;Nephila pilipes&quot;, can be at least 9 times larger than the male, while others are only slightly larger than the male. The larger size female is typically thought to be selected through fecundity selection, the idea that bigger females can produce more eggs, thus more offspring. Although a great deal of evidence points towards the greatest selection pressure on larger female size, some evidence indicates that selection can favor small male size, as well.

Araneids also exhibit a phenomenon called sexual cannibalism, which is commonly found throughout the Araneidae. Evidence suggests a negative correlation between sexual size dimorphism and instances of sexual cannibalism. Other evidence, however, has shown that differences in cannibalistic events among araneids when having smaller or slightly larger males is advantageous.

Some evidence has shown that extreme dimorphism may be the result of males avoiding detection by the females. For males of these species, being smaller in size may be advantageous in moving to the central hub of a web so female spiders may be less likely to detect the male, or even if detected as prey to be eaten, the small size may indicate little nutritional value. Larger-bodied male araneids may be advantageous when mating on a mating thread because the thread is constructed from the edge of the web orb to structural threads or to nearby vegetation. Here larger males may be less likely to be cannibalized, as the males are able to copulate while the female is hanging, which may make them safer from cannibalism. In one subfamily of Araneid that uses a mating thread, Gasteracanthinae, sexual cannibalism is apparently absent despite extreme size dimorphism.

<text>The Bodysnatchers were a seven-piece all-female band involved in the British 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

==Career==
Formed in London by Nicky Summers in 1979, in the aftermath of the punk rock scene, The Bodysnatchers released two ska/rocksteady singles on 2 Tone Records. Their first concert was in November 1979 at the Windsor Castle pub in west London, where they supported Shane MacGowan&#x27;s band The Nips. For their third gig, they were invited by Chrysalis Records to play at Debbie Harry&#x27;s birthday party in late 1979. After signing to 2 Tone Records, the band released the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Do Rock Steady&quot; (UK No. 22) and made an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in March 1980. They undertook a tour supporting The Selecter in spring 1980, and during that summer toured with The Specials and The Go-Go&#x27;s. They also released the double A side single &quot;Easy Life&quot;/&quot;Too Experienced&quot; which was produced by Jerry Dammers. The Bodysnatchers also played London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon supporting Toots and the Maytals, as well as other slots with artists such as Lene Lovich and Madness.

They appeared in the documentary film &quot;Dance Craze&quot;, featuring live performances by various 2 Tone bands. The Bodysnatchers played together for less than two years, with the group disbanding in 1981, not having released an album.

The band recorded two sessions for the &quot;John Peel Show&quot;. 14 April 1980: What&#x27;s This?; Ghost of the Vox Continental; Happy Time Tune; The Boiler. 8 September 1980: Private Eye; Hiawatha; Mixed Feelings; The Loser

===Aftermath===
Five of the original band-members evolved into another all-female band, The Belle Stars, who had a number of chart hits in the UK between 1982–83 and a US Top 20 hit with their version &quot;Iko Iko&quot; in 1989 (three years after the band had split up, though the track was featured in the film &quot;Rain Man&quot;). After The Specials&#x27; original vocalists left the band, the Bodysnatchers&#x27; lead singer, Rhoda Dakar, went on to sing with The Special AKA. Although The Bodysnatchers did not record an album, their original composition &quot;The Boiler&quot;, a harrowing tale of rape, was later recorded by Dakar and The Special AKA, featuring Nicky Summers on bass guitar.

In 1984, Sarah Jane Owen and Penny Leyton formed the all-female ska band, The Deltones, who released an album and two singles on Unicorn Records in 1989. The group disbanded in 1991.

Dakar has performed in Skaville UK, alongside former Bad Manners members Martin Stewart and Louis Alphonso. Dakar contributed vocals to Skaville UK&#x27;s debut album, &quot;1973&quot;, which was released in July 2007. In late 2007, Dakar released a solo album on Moon Ska World. &quot;Cleaning In Another Woman&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; is an acoustic album featuring new material plus covers of The Bodysnatchers hits &quot;Do Rocksteady&quot; and &quot;Easy Life&quot;.

<doc id="428082" wikidata="Q12342580" url="?curid=428082" title="Mew (Pokémon)">
<text>Mew (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is one of the many fictional species in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. It is a small, pink, Psychic-type Mythical Pokémon, which are incredibly rare and powerful Pokémon typically available only via special events. It was added to &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto at the tail end of the games&#x27; development. Though it was not planned to be obtainable, after it was discovered through data mining, its presence in the games was surrounded by many rumors and myths. For years, Mew could not be obtained legitimately in the games except through some specific Pokémon distribution events, though it could be obtained through a variety of glitches.

Mew&#x27;s first film appearance was in &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; as one of the main characters alongside Mewtwo. In the movie, a team of scientists used a fossilized Mew eyelash to create Mewtwo, a genetically enhanced Mew clone. Mew later appeared in &quot;Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew&quot; as a main character alongside Lucario. Due to the mystery surrounding its obtainability in the original games, Mew has been considered highly iconic and a large part of what made the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise so successful, as the hype around obtaining it greatly increased sales for the games.

==Concept and creation==
Mew is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Unlike the other Pokémon from &quot;Pokémon Red and Blue&quot;, Mew&#x27;s development was not overseen by Ken Sugimori, but by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto. Morimoto programmed Mew into the game secretly as a prank amongst the staff just prior to its release in Japan. Its origins, however, lay with Satoshi Tajiri, who conceived the idea of an elusive, phantom-like Pokémon from games like &quot;Xevious&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders,&quot; with the basis of these ideas being based around rumors of hidden secrets in those games. He created Mew with the intention of having a &quot;character that exists but doesn&#x27;t appear&quot; that would be the subject of rumors, which Tajiri considered exciting for players. It was intended to be a Pokémon only Game Freak staff members would know about and be able to obtain. Mew was added at the very end of the development of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; by Morimoto after the debug features were removed, which freed up just enough space to add the character despite being told not to alter the game any further at this point by Nintendo. When space was made for Mew, Morimoto initially wished for Sugimori to design the creature, but Sugimori was unable to make time due to the game&#x27;s approaching release date. As a result, Morimoto designed and made Mew himself. Mew&#x27;s sprite was much smaller and not colored in due to a lack of storage space, which was why it primarily only uses one color in its design. Sugimori later returned to help make the official artwork for the Pokémon species, basing the artwork off of the in-game sprites. He disliked the fetus-like aspects of Mew&#x27;s original in-game sprite and revised the design into its modern-day appearance.

Though it was not intended by the developers to be obtainable, due to a glitch, players were able to encounter it. During initial distributions for Mew, the pool of those who would potentially receive one was relatively small—numbering only twenty in the first and one hundred in the second—due to the fact that each Mew had to be individually generated on Morimoto&#x27;s PC and then manually traded to winning cartridges. Morimoto would later aid in the development of a later Mew event that appeared in &quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot;. Mew was the first trademark filed by Game Freak.

===Design and characteristics===
Mew is a Psychic-type Pokémon with high stats. Morimoto designed it as a pale pink feliform creature with somewhat large eyes and a long, thin tail that broadens at the end, though the shiny version is blue and rarely distributed. Mew was primarily designed off of its in-universe clone, Mewtwo. It was designed as a simpler version of Mewtwo, being visually much smaller in terms of both size and sprite, with less detail on its body, so it would take up less space in the game&#x27;s data. Mew was not shown moving until the first movie, and thus it had no behaviors and personality outlined yet. These movements and personality traits were primarily created by the movie&#x27;s animators, who were working off its in-game sprite. Morimoto was amazed upon seeing the final product in the film. Morimoto has stated that Mew is his favorite design from the series, and has even incorporated the Pokémon as a part of his signature.

Mew&#x27;s design has been considered similar to hairless cats, as well as embryos. Scientists within the game view it as being the single ancestor of all other Pokémon. It is shy and rarely seen by humans. It is a Mythical Pokémon, Pokémon species which are much more powerful and rare than standard species and are typically only made available by special event. It is the last of the Pokémon from &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in the order of the in-game Pokedex. In &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, and their remakes, the player can find journal entries in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stating that Mew was discovered deep in the jungles of Guyana, South America, on July 5 of an unspecified year, named on July 10, and that it &quot;gave birth&quot; to Mewtwo on February 6. In the video games, it is possible for Mew to learn any move that can be taught to it via several in-game mechanics, such as tutoring and &quot;Technical Machine&quot; items. It can also transform into other Pokémon via the move Transform. Due to its high overall statistics and vast move pool, Mew is regarded as one of the strongest Pokémon in &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;. In the anime, it is capable of flight, teleportation, shapeshifting (via the move Transform), rendering itself invisible, and summoning bubbles of psychic energy.

==Appearances==

===In the video games===
Mew is mentioned in a journal entry in Cinnabar Mansion, referencing an encounter with it in Guyana. At the time of its introduction, Mew could only be legitimately obtained in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games via Nintendo promotional event distributions. This period of event exclusivity ended with the release of &quot;My Pokémon Ranch&quot;, where Mew was accessible legitimately without an event distribution. Mew has subsequently been made available in many games in the series. Players can obtain it by buying a Poké Ball Plus, which contains a Mew inside of it that can be sent into &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; or &quot;Pokémon Sword and Shield&quot;. Mew is also obtainable in &quot;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl&quot; if save data exists on the console for one of the &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; games. In &quot;Pokémon Sun and Moon&quot;, a special &quot;Z-Crystal&quot; item was created for Mew, which allowed it to use a powerful attack only it could use, known as &quot;Genesis Supernova&quot;. A special event in which players could obtain Mew and use it to battle a boss Mewtwo took place in &quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&quot; for a limited time. Mew has appeared in multiple spin-offs, such as &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Go,&quot; &quot;Pokémon UNITE&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Masters EX&quot;, and &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;. It also appears as one of the Pokémon that can be released from the Poké Ball and Master Ball items in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

Mew has long been accessible by the use of glitches or cheating devices. One of the glitches discovered in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow,&quot; dubbed &quot;The Mew Glitch,&quot; involves exploiting programmed events in order to trigger a wild battle encounter with Mew, allowing for its capture. The glitch was included in Virtual Console re-releases of the game for the Nintendo 3DS, though the captured Mew is not allowed to be transferred into &quot;Pokémon Bank&quot; without the use of further glitches, which changes an in-game &quot;ID Number&quot; to allow for Mew&#x27;s successful transfer.

===In other media===
Mew&#x27;s first major appearance in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime was in &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;, where it served as one of the main characters. It was believed to be long-extinct, as well as the most powerful Pokémon in existence. After years of research, scientists used Mew&#x27;s DNA to create Mewtwo, a genetically enhanced clone of Mew who becomes the film&#x27;s main antagonist. Mew later battles it in the film, where it appears to stop Mewtwo, though in the Japanese version of the film, Mew was depicted as a cruel being who wished to destroy Mewtwo and its clones. Mew later appears in &quot;Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew&quot;, where Mew kidnaps Pikachu so it can play with him, kickstarting the plot of the film. In &quot;Pokémon Journeys: The Series&quot;, Mew appeared in a flashback showing the childhood of Goh, one of series protagonist Ash Ketchum&#x27;s traveling companions. In his childhood, Goh encountered Mew, and ever since, Goh&#x27;s goal was to capture Mew. He ends up joining a group named &quot;Project Mew&quot; which seeks to find and capture the Pokémon.

Mew appears in the &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; series of &quot;Pokémon&quot; manga. Mew, also known as the &quot;Phantom Pokémon&quot; in the manga, appears in the first chapter when the criminal organization Team Rocket tries to capture it. Red, the protagonist, also tries to capture it, but he is easily defeated by Mew. In following chapters, it is revealed that Team Rocket wants to have Mew&#x27;s DNA to finish the creation of Mewtwo, and Red and the character Green—at this point an antagonistic figure to Red—join forces to save it from being captured.

==Cultural impact==

The initial sales of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games were sluggish due to their release window, which was considered a rough patch for new game releases. However, Mew was accidentally discovered by players via glitches, and the existence of Mew led to rampant rumors on how to obtain it, the most notable of which involved looking under a truck sprite in one of the game&#x27;s major cities. Some players called Nintendo to ask about it, with the company not even being aware of Mew&#x27;s existence. To stymie possible repercussions for inserting Mew into the game, plans for releasing the Pokémon were quickly unveiled. In the spring of 1996, Game Freak&#x27;s president Satoshi Tajiri used the Japanese manga journal &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; as an experimental exhibition of Mew and distributed the first &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; cards of it as free giveaways, which surprised many at Game Freak, including Morimoto. Due to the success of the experiment, Game Freak announced further contests that would allow for Mew to be obtained. Tajiri described using Mew to create hype around an &quot;invisible character&quot; within the game and to keep interest alive in the title and create rumors and myths about the game passed around by word of mouth, which resulted in increased sales for the game.

The reveal and distribution of Mew through organized events has been noted as a major reason for the series&#x27; success in Japan, with a promotion in the April 1996 issue of &quot;CoroCoro Comics&quot; called the &quot;Legendary Pokémon Offer&quot; offering twenty winners the opportunity to send their cartridges in for Nintendo to add Mew to their games. The offer received over seventy eight thousand entries, exceeding Nintendo&#x27;s initial expectation of three thousand. Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata called it &quot;really when things turned round for Pokémon&quot;, noting that it caused weekly sales of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; to match their previous monthly sales, subsequently becoming three to four times larger. Players who missed the in-person events had to unlock Mew with cheat devices such as the Pro Action Replay. Fans often bought them solely for that purpose. Many rumors about Mew circulated due to its popularity, ranging from methods on how to obtain it to theories on its association with a similar Pokémon, Ditto, the latter of which Junichi Masuda discredited by saying &quot;each Pokémon we create [has] its own unique element.&quot; Many distribution events for other Mythical Pokémon followed in subsequent games, which were based on the success of Mew.

Studies on the impact of fictional characters on children, such as those in the book &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon&quot;, have noted Mew as popular with younger female children who tend to be drawn to &quot;cute&quot; characters; Mewtwo in comparison was described as a polar opposite, popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to &quot;tough or scary&quot; characters. The book &quot;Media and the Make-believe Worlds of Children&quot; noted a similar comparison, describing Mew as &quot;child-like and gentle, combining characteristics of power and cute&quot; and emphasizing the importance of the contrast for children between it and Mewtwo. Mew has been highlighted as a success in part due to its mysterious nature, with TheGamer writer Ben Sledge praising the mythology of Mew, both for its in-game lore and the rumors it generated. He highlighted the big impact it had on his youth, and how it made him disappointed with its easier obtainment in &quot;Pokémon GO&quot;. 

Mew has been widely used to promote the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise due to its iconicity. Mew was one of the Pokémon featured in the 1998 painting on the All Nippon Airways Boeing 747-400. In September 2006, in celebration of the release of &quot;Lucario and the Mystery of Mew&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team&quot; and &quot;Red Rescue Team&quot;, players with a copy of &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Emerald&quot;, &quot;FireRed&quot;, or &quot;LeafGreen&quot; could go to a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us store to download the creature for free. Included in the DVD of &quot;Lucario and the Mystery of Mew&quot; was a promotional Mew trading card. A special DS, featuring a color scheme similar to Mew, was also released to promote the film. A special Pokémon Card, nicknamed the &quot;Ancient Mew&quot; card, was used to promote the second Pokémon movie and featured in the film as the inspiration for antagonist Lawrence III&#x27;s goals of capturing Legendary Pokémon. The card was reprinted for Japanese showings of &quot;Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back — Evolution&quot;. In 2021, Oreos depicting Pokémon characters were released, with those depicting Mew being particularly rare and sought after by fans of the series, leading to bids on sales of the cookie jumping up to prices as high as several thousand dollars. In 2024, the Oreo Pokémon cookies were rolled out in Southeast Asia; its accompanying promo encouraged participants to send a photo of them holding a Mew cookie.

<text>Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a technique used in mass spectrometry to produce ions using an electrospray in which a high voltage is applied to a liquid to create an aerosol. It is especially useful in producing ions from macromolecules because it overcomes the propensity of these molecules to fragment when ionized. ESI is different from other ionization processes (e.g. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, MALDI) since it may produce multiple-charged ions, effectively extending the mass range of the analyser to accommodate the kDa-MDa orders of magnitude observed in proteins and their associated polypeptide fragments.

Mass spectrometry using ESI is called electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) or, less commonly, electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). ESI is a so-called &#x27;soft ionization&#x27; technique, since there is very little fragmentation. This can be advantageous in the sense that the molecular ion (or more accurately a pseudo molecular ion) is almost always observed, however very little structural information can be gained from the simple mass spectrum obtained. This disadvantage can be overcome by coupling ESI with tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Another important advantage of ESI is that solution-phase information can be retained into the gas-phase.

The electrospray ionization technique was first reported by Masamichi Yamashita and John Fenn in 1984, and independently by Lidia Gall and co-workers in Soviet Union, also in 1984. Gall&#x27;s work was not recognised or translated in the western scientific literature until a translation was published in 2008. The development of electrospray ionization for the analysis of biological macromolecules was rewarded with the attribution of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to John Bennett Fenn and Koichi Tanaka in 2002.
One of the original instruments used by Fenn is on display at the Science History Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==History==
In 1882, Lord Rayleigh theoretically estimated the maximum amount of charge a liquid droplet could carry before throwing out fine jets of liquid. This is now known as the Rayleigh limit.

In 1914, John Zeleny published work on the behaviour of fluid droplets at the end of glass capillaries and presented evidence for different electrospray modes. Wilson and Taylor and Nolan investigated electrospray in the 1920s and Macky in 1931. The electrospray cone (now known as the Taylor cone) was described by Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor.

The first use of electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry was reported by Malcolm Dole in 1968. John Bennett Fenn was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the late 1980s.

==Ionization mechanism==

The liquid containing the analytes of interest (typically 10−6 - 10−4 M needed ) is dispersed by electrospray, into a fine aerosol. Because the ion formation involves extensive solvent evaporation (also termed desolvation), the typical solvents for electrospray ionization are prepared by mixing water with volatile organic compounds (e.g. methanol acetonitrile). To decrease the initial droplet size, compounds that increase the conductivity (e.g. acetic acid) are customarily added to the solution. These species also act to provide a source of protons to facilitate the ionization process. Large-flow electrosprays can benefit from nebulization of a heated inert gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide in addition to the high temperature of the ESI source. The aerosol is sampled into the first vacuum stage of a mass spectrometer through a capillary carrying a potential difference of approximately 3000V, which can be heated to aid further solvent evaporation from the charged droplets. The solvent evaporates from a charged droplet until it becomes unstable upon reaching its Rayleigh limit. At this point, the droplet deforms as the electrostatic repulsion of like charges, in an ever-decreasing droplet size, becomes more powerful than the surface tension holding the droplet together. At this point the droplet undergoes Coulomb fission, whereby the original droplet &#x27;explodes&#x27; creating many smaller, more stable droplets. The new droplets undergo desolvation and subsequently further Coulomb fissions. During the fission, the droplet loses a small percentage of its mass (1.0–2.3%) along with a relatively large percentage of its charge (10–18%).

There are two major theories that explain the final production of gas-phase ions: the ion evaporation model (IEM) and the charge residue model (CRM). The IEM suggests that as the droplet reaches a certain radius the field strength at the surface of the droplet becomes large enough to assist the field desorption of solvated ions. The CRM suggests that electrospray droplets undergo evaporation and fission cycles, eventually leading progeny droplets that contain on average one analyte ion or less. The gas-phase ions form after the remaining solvent molecules evaporate, leaving the analyte with the charges that the droplet carried.
A large body of evidence shows either directly or indirectly that small ions (from small molecules) are liberated into the gas phase through the ion evaporation mechanism, while larger ions (from folded proteins for instance) form by charged residue mechanism.

A third model invoking combined charged residue-field emission has been proposed. Another model called chain ejection model (CEM) is proposed for disordered polymers (unfolded proteins).

The ions observed by mass spectrometry may be quasimolecular ions created by the addition of a hydrogen cation and denoted [M + H]+, or of another cation such as sodium ion, [M + Na]+, or the removal of a hydrogen nucleus, [M − H]−. Multiply charged ions such as [M + &quot;n&quot;H]&quot;n&quot;+ are often observed. For large macromolecules, there can be many charge states, resulting in a characteristic charge state envelope. All these are even-electron ion species: electrons (alone) are not added or removed, unlike in some other ionization sources. The analytes are sometimes involved in electrochemical processes, leading to shifts of the corresponding peaks in the mass spectrum. This effect is demonstrated in the direct ionization of noble metals such as copper, silver and gold using electrospray.

The efficiency of generating the gas phase ions for small molecules in ESI varies depending on the compound structure, the solvent used and instrumental parameters. The differences in ionization efficiency reach more than 1 million times.

==Variants==
The electrosprays operated at low flow rates generate much smaller initial droplets, which ensure improved ionization efficiency. In 1993 Gale and Richard D. Smith reported significant sensitivity increases could be achieved using lower flow rates, and down to 200 nL/min. In 1994, two research groups coined the name micro-electrospray (microspray) for electrosprays working at low flow rates. Emmett and Caprioli demonstrated improved performance for HPLC-MS analyses when the electrospray was operated at 300–800 nL/min. Wilm and Mann demonstrated that a capillary flow of ~ 25 nL/min can sustain an electrospray at the tip of emitters fabricated by pulling glass capillaries to a few micrometers. The latter was renamed nano-electrospray (nanospray) in 1996. Currently the name nanospray is also in use for electrosprays fed by pumps at low flow rates, not only for self-fed electrosprays. Although there may not be a well-defined flow rate range for electrospray, microspray, and nano-electrospray, studied &quot;changes in analyte partition during droplet fission prior to ion release&quot;. In this paper, they compare results obtained by three other groups. and then measure the signal intensity ratio at different flow rates.

Cold spray ionization is a form of electrospray in which the solution containing the sample is forced through a small cold capillary (10–80 °C) into an electric field to create a fine mist of cold charged droplets. Applications of this method include the analysis of fragile molecules and guest-host interactions that cannot be studied using regular electrospray ionization.

Electrospray ionization has also been achieved at pressures as low as 25 torr and termed subambient pressure ionization with nanoelectrospray (SPIN) based upon a two-stage ion funnel interface developed by Richard D. Smith and coworkers. The SPIN implementation provided increased sensitivity due to the use of ion funnels that helped confine and transfer ions to the lower pressure region of the mass spectrometer. Nanoelectrospray emitter is made out of a fine capillary with a small aperture about 1–3 micrometer. For sufficient conductivity this capillary is usually sputter-coated with conductive material, e.g. gold. Nanoelectrospray ionization consumes only a few microliters of a sample and forms smaller droplets. Operation at low pressure was particularly effective for low flow rates where the smaller electrospray droplet size allowed effective desolvation and ion formation to be achieved. As a result, the researchers were later able to demonstrate achieving an excess of 50% overall ionization utilization efficiency for transfer of ions from the liquid phase, into the gas phase as ions, and through the dual ion funnel interface to the mass spectrometer.

===Ambient ionization===

In ambient ionization, the formation of ions occurs outside the mass spectrometer without sample preparation. Electrospray is used for ion formation in a number of ambient ion sources.

Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is an ambient ionization technique in which a solvent electrospray is directed at a sample. The electrospray is attracted to the surface by applying a voltage to the sample. Sample compounds are extracted into the solvent which is again aerosolized as highly charged droplets that evaporate to form highly charged ions. After ionization, the ions enter the atmospheric pressure interface of the mass spectrometer. DESI allows for ambient ionization of samples at atmospheric pressure, with little sample preparation.

Extractive electrospray ionization is a spray-type, ambient ionization method that uses two merged sprays, one of which is generated by electrospray.

Laser-based electrospray-based ambient ionization is a two-step process in which a pulsed laser is used to desorb or ablate material from a sample and the plume of material interacts with an electrospray to create ions. For ambient ionization, the sample material is deposited on a target near the electrospray. The laser desorbs or ablates material from the sample which is ejected from the surface and into the electrospray which produces highly charged ions. Examples are electrospray laser desorption ionization, matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization, and laser ablation electrospray ionization.

Electrostatic spray ionization (ESTASI) involved the analysis of samples located on a flat or porous surface, or inside a microchannel. A droplet containing analytes is deposited on a sample area, to which a pulsed high voltage to is applied. When the electrostatic pressure is larger than the surface tension, droplets and ions are sprayed.

Secondary electrospray ionization (SESI) is an spray type, ambient ionization method where charging ions are produced by means of an electrospray. These ions then charge vapor molecules in the gas phase when colliding with them.

In paper spray ionization, the sample is applied to a piece of paper, solvent is added, and a high voltage is applied to the paper, creating ions.

==Applications==

Electrospray is used to study protein folding.

===Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry ===

Electrospray ionization is the ion source of choice to couple liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The analysis can be performed online, by feeding the liquid eluting from the LC column directly to an electrospray, or offline, by collecting fractions to be later analyzed in a classical nanoelectrospray-mass spectrometry setup. Among the numerous operating parameters in ESI-MS,for proteins, the electrospray voltage has been identified as an important parameter to consider in ESI LC/MS gradient elution. The effect of various solvent compositions (such as TFA or ammonium acetate, or supercharging reagents, or derivitizing groups) or spraying conditions on electrospray-LCMS spectra and/or nanoESI-MS spectra. have been studied.

===Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS)===
Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry was enabled by an ESI interface that was developed and patented by Richard D. Smith and coworkers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and shown to have broad utility for the analysis of very small biological and chemical compound mixtures, and even extending to a single biological cell.

===Noncovalent gas phase interactions===
Electrospray ionization is also utilized in studying noncovalent gas phase interactions. The electrospray process is thought to be capable of transferring liquid-phase noncovalent complexes into the gas phase without disrupting the noncovalent interaction. Problems such as non specific interactions have been identified when studying ligand substrate complexes by ESI-MS or nanoESI-MS. An interesting example of this is studying the interactions between enzymes and drugs which are inhibitors of the enzyme. Competition studies between STAT6 and inhibitors have used ESI as a way to screen for potential new drug candidates.

Electrospray ionization can even be used for studying protein complexes &gt;1 MDa.

<doc id="428086" wikidata="Q829956" url="?curid=428086" title="List of galaxies">
<text>There are an estimated 100 billion galaxies in all of the observable universe.
On the order of 100,000 galaxies make up the Local Supercluster, and about 51 galaxies are in the Local Group (see list of nearest galaxies for a complete list). 

The first attempts at systematic catalogues of galaxies were made in the 1960s, with the Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies listing 29,418 galaxies and galaxy clusters, and with the Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies, a putatively complete list of galaxies with photographic magnitude above 15, listing 30,642. In the 1980s, the Lyons Groups of Galaxies listed 485 galaxy groups with 3,933 member galaxies. Galaxy Zoo is a project aiming at a more comprehensive list: launched in July 2007, it has classified over one million galaxy images from The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, The Hubble Space Telescope and the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey.

==Named galaxies==

This is a list of galaxies that are well known by something other than an entry in a catalog or list, or a set of coordinates, or a systematic designation.

==Naked-eye galaxies==
This is a list of galaxies that are visible to the naked eye, for at the very least, keen-eyed observers in a very dark-sky environment that is high in altitude, during clear and stable weather.

* Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy is not listed, because it is not discernible as being a separate galaxy in the sky.

==Observational firsts==

==Prototypes==
This is a list of galaxies that became prototypes for a class of galaxies.

==Closest and most distant-known galaxies by type==

===Closest galaxies===



===Most distant galaxies===



====Timeline notes====
* MACS0647-JD, discovered in 2012, with z=10.7, does not appear on this list because it has not been confirmed with a spectroscopic redshift.
* UDFy-38135539, discovered in 2009, with z=8.6, does not appear on this list because its claimed redshift is disputed. Follow-up observations have failed to replicate the cited redshift measurement.
* A1689-zD1, discovered in 2008, with z=7.6, does not appear on this list because it has not been confirmed with a spectroscopic redshift.
* Abell 68 c1 and Abell 2219 c1, discovered in 2007, with z=9, do not appear on this list because they have not been confirmed.
* IOK4 and IOK5, discovered in 2007, with z=7, do not appear on this list because they have not been confirmed with a spectroscopic redshift.
* Abell 1835 IR1916, discovered in 2004, with z=10.0, does not appear on this list because its claimed redshift is disputed. Some follow-up observations have failed to find the object at all.
* STIS 123627+621755, discovered in 1999, with z=6.68, does not appear on this list because its redshift was based on an erroneous interpretation of an oxygen emission line as a hydrogen emission line.

* BR1202-0725 LAE, discovered in 1998 at z=5.64 does not appear on the list because it was not definitively pinned. BR1202-0725 (QSO 1202-07) refers to a quasar that the Lyman alpha emitting galaxy is near. The quasar itself lies at z=4.6947
* BR2237-0607 LA1 and BR2237-0607 LA2 were found at z=4.55 while investigating around the quasar BR2237-0607 in 1996. Neither of these appear on the list because they were not definitively pinned down at the time. The quasar itself lies at z=4.558

* Two absorption dropouts in the spectrum of quasar BR 1202-07 (QSO 1202-0725, BRI 1202-0725, BRI1202-07) were found, one in early 1996, another later in 1996. Neither of these appear on the list because they were not definitively pinned down at the time. The early one was at z=4.38, the later one at z=4.687, the quasar itself lies at z=4.695

* In 1986, a gravitationally lensed galaxy forming a blue arc was found lensed by galaxy cluster CL 2224-02 (C12224 in some references). However, its redshift was only determined in 1991, at z=2.237, by which time, it would no longer be the most distant galaxy known.

* An absorption drop was discovered in 1985 in the light spectrum of quasar PKS 1614+051 at z=3.21 This does not appear on the list because it was not definitively fixed down. At the time, it was claimed to be the first non-QSO galaxy found beyond redshift 3. The quasar itself is at z=3.197

* In 1975, 3C 123 was incorrectly determined to lie at z=0.637 (actually z=0.218).

* From 1964 to 1997, the title of most distant object in the universe was held by a succession of quasars. That list is available at list of quasars.
* In 1958, clusters Cl 0024+1654 and Cl 1447+2619 were estimated to have redshifts of z=0.29 and z=0.35, respectively. However, no galaxy was spectroscopically determined.

<text>The Belle Stars were a British pop/rock band. Formed in 1980, they are best known for their 1983 hit single &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; as well as their cover of &quot;Iko Iko&quot; originally released in 1982 and featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Rain Man&quot; in 1988.

==Career==
After the two-tone band The Bodysnatchers broke up in 1980, guitarists Stella Barker and Sarah-Jane Owen, saxophonist Miranda Joyce, keyboardist Penny Leyton, and drummer Judy Parsons formed a new band, recruiting bass player Lesley Shone and lead vocalist Jennie Matthias (also known as Jennie Bellestar). Their first performance was on Christmas Day 1980, before they had chosen a name. Black Sabbath keyboardist and noted heavy rock-progressive rock session musician, Gerald Woodroffe was also recruited.

Within a short time, the group became well-known around London, notably appearing on the front cover of &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine early in 1981. Shortly thereafter, they were signed by Stiff Records, then highly successful through its star act, Madness.

The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, was released in the late spring of 1981; it was produced by Madness producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. The band promoted the single by playing support slots at gigs by ska acts The Beat and Madness. However, the single failed to chart, despite continuing media attention. In May 1981, the band opened for The Clash on tour dates in Brussels, Lille, and Paris.

The same production team were responsible for &quot;Slick Trick&quot;, the second single. It too failed to chart. Keyboard player Penny Leyton left the band late in the year, to be replaced on saxophone and keyboards by Clare Hirst.

When the third single, the radio-friendly &quot;Another Latin Love Song&quot; again failed to break into the chart, the band tried cover versions instead, with some success. &quot;Iko Iko&quot;, a cover of The Dixie Cups&#x27; 1965 hit (later featured in the 1988 movie &quot;Rain Man&quot;), was The Belle Stars&#x27; long-hoped-for UK Singles Chart debut, peaking at number 35 in June 1982. This single was released at the same time as another version by Natasha England, whose version went on to reach the UK Top Ten. The Belle Stars furthered this with &quot;The Clapping Song&quot; (their first top 20 hit), a remake of the 1965 Shirley Ellis hit, and then &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, a hit for Inez and Charlie Foxx in 1963 and James Taylor and Carly Simon in 1974.

In January 1983, the Belle Stars released what would be their signature single, &quot;Sign of the Times&quot;, peaking at number three, and a chart success throughout Europe. The song&#x27;s music video, showing the Belle Stars in dinner jackets, was also played frequently by MTV in the United States. The song went on to become the 30th-best selling single of 1983 in the UK. &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; was produced by Peter Collins for Loose Ends Productions, a company managed by Pete Waterman before he became famous as a third of the Stock/Aitken/Waterman production team. A Canadian all female studio vocal trio known as &quot;Men&#x27;s Room&quot; covered &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; in 1983 almost exactly as the original, taking their version to number nine in Canada while the Belle Stars&#x27; version did not chart there.

&quot;Sign of the Times&quot; was followed a month later by the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album, which reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. As with the band&#x27;s singles, it was a mix of original songs and cover versions, including Bob and Earl&#x27;s &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; (covered three years later by the Rolling Stones on &quot;Dirty Work&quot;) and Al Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Snake&quot;.

However, &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; proved to be the peak of the band&#x27;s success. Each follow-up single was less successful than its predecessor: &quot;Sweet Memory&quot; reached number 22 in the chart in April 1983; &quot;Indian Summer&quot; number 52 in August; whilst &quot;The Entertainer&quot; did not chart. It took another year before the band had a minor hit, &quot;80&#x27;s Romance&quot;, which made number 71 in August 1984 before it dropped out after a week. Despite this, the band continued to tour throughout Europe. However, the lack of success took its toll, and Matthias left the band, followed by others, until the band was down to Owen, Joyce, and Shone. Owen became the &#x27;de facto&#x27; lead vocalist, though all three members often sang in unison, in the style of Bananarama.

Stiff Records was ailing by 1984, and it merged with Island Records; in July 1985 it was liquidated and bought by ZTT, the label owned by the husband-and-wife team of producer Trevor Horn and Jill Sinclair. Under Horn&#x27;s supervision, the three remaining members recorded a new Belle Stars album in New York City with the 4th &amp; Broadway production team. However, the only tracks to be released were those on the single &quot;World Domination&quot;, which flopped in Britain but peaked at number two for two weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Disco chart in the US. Following this release, the band broke up.

However, in March 1989, the Belle Stars finally had a big US chart hit, when &quot;Iko Iko&quot; reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 after it was included on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Rain Man&quot;, starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. The song had been a favourite of Hoffman&#x27;s. Matthias toured the US to promote the song.

Leyton went on to join the all-girl ska band The Deltones in 1984; they released an album on Unicorn Records in 1989.

Matthias guested on the &quot;1973&quot; (2007) and &quot;Decadent&quot; (2008) albums by Skaville UK. In about 2008, she formed a new ska band with Lee Thompson from Madness called The Dance Brigade; and then formed her own band, 1-Stop-Experience, with Skip McDonald, Paget King and Chico Chigas; they disbanded in 2013. She also performed at the Let&#x27;s Rock 2019 festival.

In September 2019, four previously unreleased Belle Stars songs from the Anne Dudley sessions for the second album, and a live concert from 1983, were included in a comprehensive box set, &quot;Turn Back the Clock&quot; from Edsel Records.

<doc id="428104" wikidata="Q3028601" url="?curid=428104" title="Rex 84">
<text>Rex 84B, short for Readiness Exercise 1984 Bravo, was a classified scenario and drill developed by the United States federal government to detain large numbers of United States residents deemed to be &quot;national security threats&quot; in the event that the president declared a National Emergency. The scenario envisioned state defense forces rounding up 500,000 undocumented Central American residents and 4,000 American citizens whom the US Attorney General had designated as &quot;national security threats&quot; as part of the secret Continuity of Government program. These people would be detained at 22 military bases in concentration camps run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

==Background==
The existence of master military contingency plans (of which Rex 84 was a part), Operation Garden Plot and a similar earlier exercise, Lantern Spike, were originally revealed by journalist Ron Ridenhour, who summarized his findings in a 1975 article in &quot;CounterSpy&quot; magazine. Starting in 1981, the DoD and FEMA began a tradition of bi-annual joint exercises to test civil mobilization using the names Proud Saber and Rex 82. In 1984, the scenario involved a US Army rehearsal of airlifting the entire 82nd Airborne Division (consisting of 15,000 troops) from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, under the cover of night and flying them to either El Salvador or Nicaragua as a simulated invasion to enforce a state of martial law. This part of the exercise had been code named Rex 84 Night Train, and the overall readiness exercise, involving 34 federal agencies, was code named Rex 84, with FEMA&#x27;s role in assisting the DoD as Rex 84 Alpha. Later, when the mass detention scenario involving FEMA was added at the request of FEMA director Louis Giuffrida and Reagan Advisor Edwin Meese and personally authorized by President Ronald Reagan, the mass detention scenario was code named Rex 84 Bravo. It was modeled on a 1970s Giuffreda-Meese-Reagan exercise in California known as Operation Cable Splicer.

The plan was first discovered by the Christic Institute in 1984 and first revealed in detail in a major daily newspaper by reporter Alfonso Chardy in the July 5, 1987 edition of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;. Possible reasons for such a roundup were reported to be widespread opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad, such as if the United States were to directly invade Central America. To combat what the government perceived as &quot;subversive activities&quot;, the plan also authorized the military to direct the movement of civilian populations at state and regional levels, according to Professor Diana Reynolds.

==Role in Iran-Contra==

The FEMA role in Rex 84, branded Rex 84B, was brainstormed by Louis Giuffrida as a way to ship arms to the Contras, in violation of the Boland Amendment, a potentially impeachable offense. The states of Texas, Alabama, and Louisiana had established civilian &quot;state defense forces&quot; independent of the national guard, recruiting mercenaries through the magazine &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;. This allowed FEMA to sidestep its own and Department of Defense procurement rules for the weapons needed for mass detentions and sidestepped the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits deploying US military forces in the United States to enforce civilian laws against civilians. The Pentagon shipped the state security forces massive amounts of arms and military equipment for the exercise, and the defense forces were instructed to re-value the equipment at its higher replacement value. At the end of the exercise, the security forces only returned equipment at the value originally shipped, leaving surplus military equipment in the hands of civilians. These weapons were then &quot;donated&quot; to Central Intelligence Agency front-charities and shipped to the Contras in Central America under the cover of humanitarian supplies.

==Continuity of Government==

Transcripts from the Iran–Contra hearings on July 13, 1987 record the following dialogue between Congressman Jack Brooks, Oliver North&#x27;s attorney Brendan Sullivan, and Senator Daniel Inouye, the Democratic Chair of the joint Senate–House Committee:

Contingency plans by the US Government for rounding up people perceived by the government to be subversive or a threat to civil order have existed for many decades. For example, from 1967 to 1971, the FBI kept a list of over 100,000 people to be rounded up as subversive, dubbed the &quot;ADEX&quot; list. Such a list existed in 1984 as part of the classified Continuity of Government program; however, when Giuffreda asked Attorney General William French Smith to release the list to FEMA for the exercise, the Attorney General refused.

AG French&#x27;s concerns about FEMA&#x27;s role in Rex 84B led to several reforms. It emerged FEMA&#x27;s Director of Civil Security had compiled a list of 12,000 names of political security threats, intruding on the FBI&#x27;s jurisdiction. While FEMA spent resources building civil security infrastructure such as detention camp supplies, it neglected its basic civil defense role. Giuffreda resigned in 1985 after a US House of Representatives subcommittee charged that FEMA was being mismanaged. A secret DoD/CIA joint investigation into the potential unconstitutionality of FEMA&#x27;s role in planning for civil security emergencies (i.e. martial law) unearthed the Rex 84B plan and exercise data; however, this was destroyed by the investigator, CIA agent William Buckley, who would later be kidnapped and murdered while serving as Beirut station chief in 1985 by the Islamic Jihad Organization.

==Legacy==
Rex 84B&#x27;s scenario of mass detention of US citizens and residents under an unrealistic pretext and without congressional debate is often cited by civil libertarians opposing the militarization of police, and has also given rise to the FEMA camps conspiracy theory. The existence of the ADEX list presaged mass restrictions on movement without due process such as the no-fly list. The exercise&#x27;s fictional scenario of viewing Central American refugees as potential subversives who might organize themselves into terrorist cells was sent to the FBI as fact, leading to a crackdown by border authorities and federal government hostility to the American Sanctuary Movement. In 2003, Congressman Jim McDermott cited Rex 84B in raising concerns about martial law in the United States as part of the Global War on Terror.

The Rex 84 scenario is unlikely to be constitutional because in 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned its decision in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, the 1944 decision upholding the mass internment of Japanese Americans without due process during World War II.

<doc id="428105" wikidata="Q1062083" url="?curid=428105" title="Billionaire">
<text>A billionaire is a person with a net worth of at least one billion units of a given currency, usually of a major currency such as the United States dollar, euro, or pound sterling. It is a sub-category of the concept of the ultra high-net-worth individual. The American business magazine &quot;Forbes&quot; produces a global list of known U.S. dollar billionaires every year and updates an internet version of this list in real time. The American oil magnate John D. Rockefeller became the world&#x27;s first confirmed U.S. dollar billionaire in 1916.

 there are 2,781 billionaires worldwide, with a combined wealth of over US$14.2 trillion, up from in 2023. According to a 2024 Oxfam report, the world&#x27;s top 1% of earners own more combined wealth &quot;than 95% of humanity&quot;, and also stated that the world&#x27;s top 1% of earners also owned 43% of all global financial assets. As of October 2024, seventeen people have reached the status of USD centibillionaires, meaning that each has had a net worth of at least $100 billion. 

== Current U.S. dollar billionaires ==

According to the &quot;UBS/PwC Billionaires Report 2019&quot; report released in November 2019, there are currently 2,101 U.S. dollar billionaires worldwide, from 66 countries, with a combined net worth of $8.5 trillion. Also according to the report, billionaires have a substantial positive impact on the sustainability and success of companies controlled by them. Billionaire-controlled companies listed on the equity market returned 17.8 percent, compared with the 9.1 percent of the MSCI AC World Index. According to the authors of the report, this Billionaire Effect is connected with smart risk-taking and willingness to plan and invest for the long term. 

The majority of billionaires are male, as fewer than 11% (197 of 1,826) on the 2015 list were female billionaires. The United States has the largest number of billionaires of any country, with 536 , while China, India and Russia are home to 213, 90 and 88 billionaires, respectively. , only 46 billionaires were under the age of 40, while the list of American-only billionaires, as of 2010, had an average age of 66.

Different authorities use different methodologies to determine net worth and to rank them, and not all information about personal finances is publicly available. In 2019, Forbes counted a record 607 billionaires in the U.S.. Over the course of the 2020s, depending on the source and the year, the world&#x27;s richest person has been reckoned to be Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault and family, or Elon Musk.

In 2019, 19 people became billionaires. Four were a result of death or divorce, including Julia Koch, and Jeff Bezos&#x27;s former wife MacKenzie Scott. From 2014 to 2019, the number of female billionaires grew by 46%. That is more than the number of male billionaires in the same period (39%). As of 2019 there were 233 female billionaires in the world, compared to 160 in 2013.

== Education and work experience ==

Billionaires come from a very wide number of backgrounds. A review of the education and work histories of the top 400 billionaires shows little correlation between education and success. Nearly 30% of billionaires do not have a college degree, greatly exceeding any other educational background. The most common field of university education was finance and economics, which only contributed to a combined 15.5% of billionaire educations.
There is little correlation between any university and becoming a billionaire. The top 10 universities produced just 99 of the top 400 billionaires combined, significantly less than the total number of billionaires who were not college educated. Military service produced 21 billionaires, more than any single university.

Very few college-educated billionaires pursued business interests in their field of study, with the exception of computer science majors. All twelve of the computer science major billionaires worked in computer science, while only half of engineers worked in engineering, and less than a quarter of finance and economics majors ever worked in finance or economics. The most common field for billionaires to enter was sales and military service.

== Inequality ==
According to a 2016 Oxfam report, the wealth of the poorest 95% dropped by 38% between 2010 and 2015, due to an increase in the global population by 400 million. In the same period, the wealth of the richest 62 people between the World&#x27;s Billionaires increased by $500bn (£350bn) to $1.76tn. More recently, in 2017 an Oxfam report noted that just eight billionaires have as much net worth as &quot;half the human race&quot;. However, the Oxfam report has been criticized for considering debt as negative wealth, which leads to wealthy people with large amounts of debt to be considered poor or not wealthy.

== Statistics ==
These aggregated statistics for billionaires include the total number of known billionaires and the net worth of the world&#x27;s wealthiest individual for each year since 2008. Data for each year is from the annual &quot;Forbes&quot; list of billionaires, with currency figures given in U.S. dollars. Data since 2018 also includes the Wealth-X billionaire census which typically finds higher numbers than &quot;Forbes&quot;.

<doc id="428111" wikidata="Q2373660" url="?curid=428111" title="Parabolic coordinates">
<text>Parabolic coordinates are a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system in which the coordinate lines are confocal parabolas. A three-dimensional version of parabolic coordinates is obtained by rotating the two-dimensional system about the symmetry axis of the parabolas. 

Parabolic coordinates have found many applications, e.g., the treatment of the Stark effect and the potential theory of the edges.

== Two-dimensional parabolic coordinates ==

Two-dimensional parabolic coordinates formula_1 are defined by the equations, in terms of Cartesian coordinates:

:formula_2

:formula_3

The curves of constant formula_4 form confocal parabolae

:formula_5

that open upwards (i.e., towards formula_6), whereas the curves of constant formula_7 form confocal parabolae

:formula_8

that open downwards (i.e., towards formula_9). The foci of all these parabolae are located at the origin.

The Cartesian coordinates formula_10 and formula_11 can be converted to parabolic coordinates by:
:formula_12

:formula_13

==Two-dimensional scale factors==

The scale factors for the parabolic coordinates formula_1 are equal

:formula_15

Hence, the infinitesimal element of area is

:formula_16

and the Laplacian equals

:formula_17

Other differential operators such as formula_18 
and formula_19 can be expressed in the coordinates formula_1 by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in orthogonal coordinates.

==Three-dimensional parabolic coordinates==

The two-dimensional parabolic coordinates form the basis for two sets of three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates. The parabolic cylindrical coordinates are produced by projecting in the formula_21-direction.
Rotation about the symmetry axis of the parabolae produces a set of 
confocal paraboloids, the coordinate system of tridimensional parabolic coordinates. Expressed in terms of cartesian coordinates:

:formula_22

:formula_23

:formula_24

where the parabolae are now aligned with the formula_21-axis,
about which the rotation was carried out. Hence, the azimuthal angle formula_26 is defined

:formula_27

The surfaces of constant formula_4 form confocal paraboloids

:formula_29

that open upwards (i.e., towards formula_30) whereas the surfaces of constant formula_7 form confocal paraboloids 

:formula_32

that open downwards (i.e., towards formula_33). The foci of all these paraboloids are located at the origin.

The Riemannian metric tensor associated with this coordinate system is

:formula_34

==Three-dimensional scale factors==

The three dimensional scale factors are:

:formula_35
:formula_36
:formula_37

It is seen that the scale factors formula_38 and formula_39 are the same as in the two-dimensional case. The infinitesimal volume element is then

:formula_40

and the Laplacian is given by

:formula_41

Other differential operators such as formula_18 
and formula_19 can be expressed in the coordinates formula_44 by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in orthogonal coordinates.

<doc id="428117" wikidata="Q284286" url="?curid=428117" title="StuffIt">
<text>StuffIt is a discontinued family of computer software utilities for archiving and compressing files. Originally produced for Macintosh, versions for Microsoft Windows, Linux (x86), and Sun Solaris were later created. The proprietary compression format used by the StuffIt utilities is also termed StuffIt.

In December 2019, Smith Micro Software, the product&#x27;s most-recent owner and developer, officially announced that StuffIt had reached its end-of-life and that StuffIt products would no longer be developed. One last update did come out in December 2020 after the launch of the Apple M1 architecture to support that and Intel Mac systems through a universal binary of the program.

==Overview==

StuffIt was originally developed in the summer of 1987 by Raymond Lau, who was then a student at Stuyvesant High School in New York City. It combined the fork-combining capabilities of utilities such as MacBinary with newer compression algorithms similar to those used in ZIP. Compared to existing utilities on the Mac, notably PackIt, StuffIt offered &quot;one step&quot; operation and higher compression ratios. By the fall of 1987 StuffIt had largely replaced PackIt in the Mac world, with many software sites even going so far as to convert existing PackIt archives to save more space.

StuffIt soon became very popular and Aladdin Systems was formed to market it (the last shareware release by Lau was version 1.5.1). They split the product line in two, offering StuffIt Classic in shareware and StuffIt Deluxe as a commercial package. Deluxe added a variety of additional functions, including additional compression methods and integration into the Mac Finder to allow files to be compressed from a &quot;Magic Menu&quot;, or seamlessly browse inside and edit compressed files without expanding them using &quot;True Finder Integration&quot;. 

StuffIt was upgraded several times, and Lau removed himself from direct development as major upgrades to the &quot;internal machinery&quot; were rare. Because new features and techniques appeared regularly on the Macintosh platform, the shareware utility Compact Pro emerged as a competitor to StuffIt in the early 1990s.

A major competitive upgrade followed, accompanied by the release of the freeware StuffIt Expander, to make the format more universally readable, as well as the shareware StuffIt Lite which made it easier to produce. Prior to this anyone attempting to use the format needed to buy StuffIt, making Compact Pro more attractive. This move was a success, and Compact Pro subsequently fell out of use.

Several other Mac compression utilities appeared and disappeared during the 1990s, but none became a real threat to StuffIt&#x27;s dominance. The only ones to see any widespread use were special-purpose &quot;disk expanders&quot; like DiskDoubler and SuperDisk!, which served a different niche. Apparently as a side-effect, StuffIt once again saw few upgrades. The file format changed in a number of major revisions, leading to incompatible updates. PC-based formats long surpassed the original StuffIt format in terms of compression, notably newer systems like RAR and 7z. These had little impact on the Mac market, as most of these never appeared in an easy-to-use program on the Mac.

With the introduction of Mac OS X, newer Mac software lost their forks and no longer needed anything except the built-in Unix utilities like gzip and tar. Numerous programs &quot;wrapping&quot; these utilities were distributed, and since these files could be opened on any machine, they were considerably more practical than StuffIt in an era when most data is cross-platform. With the release of OS X Public Beta, Aladdin Systems released StuffIt 6.0 which runs under OS X.
Although it was late to market, Aladdin Systems introduced the completely new StuffIt X format in September 2002 with StuffIt Deluxe 7.0 for Macintosh. It was designed to be extendable, support more compression methods, support long file names, and support Unix and Windows file attributes. StuffIt X improves over the original StuffIt format and its descendants by adding multiple compression algorithms such as PPM, and BWT to LZW-type compression. It also added a &quot;block mode&quot; option, error correcting &quot;redundancy&quot; options to protect against data loss, and several encryption options. In January 2005, JPEG compression was added as a StuffIt X compression option (see the related &#x27;SIF Format&#x27; below).

From the mid-1990s until the 2005 acquisition by Smith Micro Software, coinciding with the release of Mac OS X v10.4 &quot;Tiger,&quot; StuffIt Expander came bundled with the Macintosh operating system.

Although Mac files generally did not use filename extensions, one of StuffIt&#x27;s primary uses was to allow Mac files to be stored on non-Mac systems where extensions were required.
So, StuffIt-compressed files save the resource forks of the Macintosh files inside them, and typically have the extension . Newer (non-backwards compatible) Stuffit X-compressed files carry the file extension . Encrypted StuffIt archives created with the now-discontinued &quot;Private File&quot; utility will have extensions. StuffIt-compressed &quot;ShrinkWrap&quot; disk images will carry or extensions. However, a Classic Mac OS version of StuffIt is needed to mount the images or convert them to a newer format readable in macOS.

Smith Micro Software offers free downloads of StuffIt Expander for Mac and Windows, which expands (uncompresses) files compressed using the StuffIt and StuffIt X format, as well as many other compressed, encoded, encrypted and segmented formats. The shareware application DropStuff permits the compressing of files into the StuffIt X format.

The StuffIt and StuffIt X formats remain, unlike some other file compression formats, proprietary, and Smith Micro Software charge license fees for its use in other programs. Given this, few alternative programs support the format.

There was also a &quot;self-expanding&quot; variant of StuffIt files with a extension that runs as an executable. A utility called exists to turn such an executable into a vanilla sit file.

== Derivative products ==
===StuffIt Image Format (SIF)===
Early in 2005, a new JPEG compression system was released that regularly obtained compression in the order of 25% (meaning a compressed file size 75% of the original file size) without any further loss of image quality and with the ability to rebuild the original file, not just the original image. (ZIP-like programs typically achieve JPEG compression rates in the order of 1 to 3%. Programs that optimize JPEGs without regard for the original file, only the original image, obtain compression rates from 3 to 10% (depending on the efficiency of the original JPEG). Programs that use the rarely implemented arithmetic coding option available to the JPEG standard typically achieve rates around 12%.)

The new technique was implemented as a StuffIt X format option in their &quot;StuffIt Deluxe&quot; product. They have also proposed a new image format known as SIF, which simply consists of a single JPEG file compressed using this new technique.

Pending filing of their patent, they retain knowledge of the details of this algorithm as a trade secret. Some details are disclosed in: the high JPEG recompression is achieved by undoing the last step of the JPEG compression itself (the Huffman encoding of quantized transform coefficients). Instead, the transform coefficients are compressed by a more efficient algorithm (a predictive model based on the DC coefficients of neighboring blocks). Similar techniques are also applied for other image file formats such as GIF and TIFF and even the MP3 music file format. By means of decomposition, the relatively high compression rates for individual file formats can also be achieved for container file formats such as PDF, PSD and even ZIP.

===StuffIt Wireless===
On July 5, 2005, Smith Micro Software announced their acquisition and intention to expand the new JPEG recompression technique to wireless platforms and other file formats. The initial press release and preliminary information saw the first use of the title “StuffIt Wireless.”

===StuffIt Expander===
StuffIt Expander is a proprietary, freeware, closed source, decompression software utility developed by Allume Systems (a subsidiary of Smith Micro Software formerly known as Aladdin Systems). It runs on the classic Mac OS, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. Prior to 2011, a Linux version had also been available for download.

==Notable features==
===Duplicate Folding===

Duplicate Folding is a feature which saves even more space by only keeping one copy of a duplicate file in an archive.
==Issues==
=== Backwards compatibility ===
Changes to the Stuffit compression format render previous versions of Stuffit or software using its API unable to decompress newer archives, necessitating installation of new versions. This incompatibility can be inconvenient for work flows where timely execution is of importance, or where the intended recipient&#x27;s system is not capable of running newer versions of Stuffit. Though users are able to create archives in a legacy format, this functionality is not clearly exposed.

==Alternatives==
macOS includes Archive Utility which decompresses the legacy open formats ZIP, GZIP, and BZIP2, and creates ZIP. In versions since 10.3 (Panther), it now preserves resource forks in the ZIP format, so Stuffit is no longer a requirement for Mac file compression. ZIP is also a &quot;de facto&quot; standard, making it more widely accepted for archives and sharing.

While StuffIt used to be a standard way of packaging Mac software for download, macOS native compressed disk images (DMG) have largely replaced this practice.

StuffIt might still be used in situations where its specific features are required (archive editing/browsing, better compression, JPEG compression, encryption, old packages). An open source alternative might be The Unarchiver, even if it doesn&#x27;t support the last versions of the StuffIt file formats. Some 3rd-party software, such as the Macintosh Finder replacement Path Finder, use the licensed Stuffit SDK to gain all the features of Stuffit. The mar utility is advocated by some retrocomputing enthusiasts as a cross-platform alternative, but its archive format is different, and documentation other than the mar and mac-utils source code archives is scarce.

<doc id="428118" wikidata="Q2345596" url="?curid=428118" title="53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division">
<text>The 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army that fought in both the First and Second World Wars. Originally raised in 1908 as the Welsh Division, part of the Territorial Force (TF), the division saw service in First World War, being designated 53rd (Welsh) Division in mid-1915, and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign and in the Middle East. Remaining active in the Territorial Army (TA) during the interwar period as a peacetime formation, the division again saw action in Second World War, fighting in North-western Europe from June 1944 until May 1945.

The 53rd Division was temporarily disbanded at the end of the war, but was reactivated in 1947 when the Territorial Army was reformed and reorganised. In 1968 the division was finally deactivated, but its 160th Brigade remains in service today. As the name suggests, the division recruited mainly in Wales, but also in Herefordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire.

==Formation==
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. One of the divisions was the Welsh Division. In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was, from 1909, at 3 Belmont in Shrewsbury.

==First World War==
The Welsh Division was mobilised upon Britain&#x27;s entrance into the First World War in early August 1914.

In 1915, the Welsh Division was numbered as the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the brigades became, respectively, the 158th (North Wales) Brigade the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade and the 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade. Some original battalions were detached early in the First World War to reinforce other divisions.

The division sailed from Devonport, bound for Gallipoli via Imbros (now Gökçeada) on 19 July 1915 and landed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli Peninsula on 9 August 1915. The division was evacuated from Gallipoli during December 1915 and moved to Egypt. The evacuation was forced by a combination of combat, disease and harsh weather which saw the division reduced to just 162 officers and 2,428 men, approximately 15% of full strength.

On 26 March 1917, the 53rd (Welsh) Division bore the brunt of the First Battle of Gaza where the three brigades, along with the 161st (Essex) Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, had to advance across exposed ground, withstanding shrapnel, machine gun and rifle fire, to capture the Turkish fortifications. Despite gaining the advantage towards the end of the day, the British commander, Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode called off the attack so that the division&#x27;s casualties, were suffered in vain.

Other division actions included the Battle of Romani in August 1916, the Battle of El Buggar Ridge in October 1917 and the action of Tell &#x27;Asur in March 1918.

==Between the wars==
The division was disbanded after the war, along with the rest of the Territorial Force which was reformed in the 1920s as the Territorial Army, and created on a similar basis to the Territorial Force and the 53rd Division was reformed. The division saw a great change in its units between the wars.

==Second World War==

===1939===
The Territorial Army and the 53rd (Welsh) Division, commanded by Major-General Bevil Wilson serving under Western Command, was mobilised on 1 September 1939, the day the German Army invaded Poland, and two days later the Second World War officially began. The early days of the war for the 53rd Division were spent in training the divisions&#x27; 2nd Line duplicate, the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, created earlier in the year, and containing many former members and much equipment, of the 53rd Division. In October, just over a month after the war began, most of the 53rd Division was sent to Northern Ireland, coming under command of British Troops Northern Ireland.

===1940–1941===
After the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France and Belgium was evacuated from Dunkirk in mid-1940, the threat grew of a German invasion of Northern Ireland. The 61st Infantry Division arrived to help defend it, with the 53rd Division charged with responsibility for the southern half of Ulster and the 61st Division the northern. The divisions came under the command of III Corps. In March 1941, the garrison was reinforced with the 5th Infantry Division, a Regular Army formation that had fought in France in 1940. The 53rd Division took part in many exercises, training by battalion, brigade, division and corps level. &quot;It was a very different 53rd Division which returned to near its own countryside in November 1941, from the comparatively untrained one which had moved to Ireland in driblets between October 1939 and April 1940.&quot; The 53rd Division, now commanded by Major-General Gerard Bucknall, returned to the Welsh Border counties again in November 1941, with the divisional HQ based in Whitchurch, Shropshire.

===1942–1943===
The division was again serving under Western Command. In April 1942 the division was sent to defend Kent in South-Eastern Command, under Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, between 1942–1943, joining XII Corps ready to defeat a German invasion (Operation Sea Lion), serving with the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division and 46th Infantry Division. The 53rd Division was later earmarked to form part of the Second Army for the invasion of Europe.
In September 1942, the division received a new GOC (General Officer Commanding), Major-General Robert Knox &quot;Bobby&quot; Ross, an officer of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) who arrived to replace Major-General Gerard Bucknall. Like most senior British commanders of the Second World War, he was a veteran of the Great War, where he had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross. Before promotion to command of the 53rd, he had commanded the 160th Infantry Brigade and before that, the 2nd Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment in Palestine. He commanded the 53rd (Welsh) Division until August 1945, training the division to a very high standard in England and Kent and leading it throughout the campaign in North-west Europe.

On 17 May 1942 the 53rd (Welsh) Division was reorganised, its 159th Infantry Brigade detaching to help form the 11th Armoured Division (The Black Bull), with the 31st Tank Brigade taking its place as part of an experiment with &quot;New Model Divisions&quot; (or Mixed Divisions) of one tank brigade and two infantry brigades. The experiment was abandoned in late 1943, being judged unsuitable for the terrain in North-western Europe and the 31st Tank Brigade was replaced by the 71st Infantry Brigade (containing the 1st East Lancashire Regiment, 1st Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and 1st Highland Light Infantry, nicknamed the &quot;Foreign&quot; or International Brigade) from the disbanded 42nd Armoured Division, in October.

The division spent the remaining period in the build-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) in training. The intensity of training was stepped up in 1944. Early in the year 53rd (Welsh) Division was involved in two corps-level exercises. In March divisional HQ and the brigade and ancillary HQs took part in &#x27;Exercise Shudder&#x27; to study &#x27;thrust line&#x27; technique, then in April the whole division was engaged in &#x27;Exercise Henry&#x27; on the South Downs training area; this included a river crossing and full-scale simulated attack. In May &#x27;Exercise Bud&#x27; practised loading vehicles onto landing craft. Finally, in the last week of May, the division began moving into its concentration area at Herne Bay, ready for the invasion.

===1944–1945===
53rd (Welsh) Division landed in Normandy on 28 June 1944, the second last British infantry division to land and was placed under command of XII Corps, defending the Odon Valley position. The division was involved in much fighting in this area, with the 158th Brigade detached to fight with the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division in the Second Battle of the Odon (Operation Greenline) before Operation Goodwood in mid-July. In August it began to push beyond the Odon and crossed the river Orne, helping to close the Falaise Pocket. It was during this fighting that Acting Captain Tasker Watkins, Officer Commanding (OC) B Company of the 1/5th Battalion, Welch Regiment was awarded the Victoria Cross, the first and only to be awarded to the regiment and division during the war, as well as the only Welshman of the British Army during the Second World War to be awarded the VC.

On 2 August, the GOC, Major-General Ross, decided that due to the casualties suffered by the division in Normandy and an acute lack of infantry replacements, the battalions of 158th Brigade (the 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions of the Royal Welch Fusiliers) were replaced and sent to other brigades of the division, the 4th RWF transferring to 71 Brigade and 6th RWF to 160 Brigade while the 7th RWF remained in 158 Brigade. &quot;It was found that with three Battalions of one Regiment in the same Brigade – as in the case of the 158th Brigade with its three Battalions of Royal Welch Fusiliers – difficulties were experienced in providing reinforcements in the event of heavy casualties. This was particularly so with Officer reinforcements.&quot; (Curiously though, this did occur with the 131st (Queen&#x27;s) Brigade of the 7th Armoured Division). By 31 August 1944 the 53rd (Welsh) Division had suffered many casualties; in just over two months of fighting 52 officers and 533 other ranks were killed, 145 officers were wounded, 18 missing, 2,711 other ranks wounded and 360 missing for a total of 3,819 casualties. The division had managed to capture over 3,800 prisoners of war (POWs).

The division took part in the &quot;Swan&quot; (swift advance) to Belgium where much fighting took place to secure an important bridgehead at the Junction Canal near Lommel. The 53rd Division then fought hard to expand the salient south of Eindhoven in conjunction with the Operation Market Garden, which ended in failure due to events at the Battle of Arnhem in late September, where the British 1st Airborne Division was virtually destroyed in severe fighting. Advancing into the Netherlands, 53rd (Welsh) Division liberated the city of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in four days of heavy fighting from 24 October.

In December 1944, attached to XXX Corps, it was one of the British divisions that took part in the mainly American Battle of the Bulge, helping to cut off the northern tip of the German salient. For the next few weeks, the division absorbed large numbers of replacements and trained the newcomers. Still with XXX Corps, which was attached to the First Canadian Army, it was later sent north in front of the Siegfried Line to take part in Operation Veritable (the Battle of the Reichswald Forest) in February 1945 where the division, supported by Churchill tanks of the 34th Armoured Brigade, was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the campaign thus far, against determined German paratroopers and fighting in terrain similar to that found at Passchendaele 27 years before but with the addition of the cold of &quot;winter rain, mud and flooding&quot;, where the mud was knee-deep. The Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment described the fighting in the forest as a &quot;terribly wearing business for the men. Psychologically and mentally. It was nearly all bayonet, Sten and grenade fighting. The Bosch reserves fought very well, stubborn and had to be dug out with the bayonet.&quot; Throughout Veritable the 53rd Division suffered almost 2,500 casualties (including psychiatric casualties), roughly a quarter of what they suffered throughout the entire campaign, while capturing over 3,000 prisoners.

The division, now under command of XII Corps, under Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, took part in Operation Plunder, the crossing of the Rhine, and advancing into Germany, where they ended the war. Throughout its 10 months of almost continuous combat, the 53rd (Welsh) Division had suffered nearly 10,000 casualties: 113 officers and 1,396 other ranks killed, 387 officers and 7,221 other ranks wounded and 33 officers and 1,255 other ranks missing. Of those declared missing, 3 officers and 553 other ranks rejoined their units, bringing the total casualties for the division to 9,849 killed, wounded or missing. As with most divisions, the majority of these casualties were sustained by the average &quot;Tommy&quot; in the infantry–nicknamed the PBI or &quot;Poor Bloody Infantry&quot;–who had sustained more than 80 percent of the total losses. According to Ross the division &quot;captured some 35,000 prisoners of war and probably accounted for the same amount in dead and wounded.&quot;

==Post-war==
The division ended the war in 1945 in Hamburg. It served later as a peacekeeping force in the Rhineland, then disbanded to reform the 2nd Infantry Division in Germany in early 1947. It was reactivated later that year, serving as part of the peacetime TA. In 1961 the division became a district headquarters as 53rd (Welsh) Division/District, and it was disbanded in 1967. The district headquarters itself formed the core of the structure for the creation of Headquarters Wales under HQ UK Land Forces in 1972.

There remain a few remnants of the division in the TA. The 160th Brigade is the regional brigade responsible for the administration of all TA units in Wales, while 53 (Welsh) Signal Squadron is the descendant formation of 53rd (Welsh) Divisional Signal Regiment, and continues to serve in a very similar capacity, providing communications support to the 160th Brigade.

<text>Caloian (also Calian(i), Caloiță, Scaloian, Gherman, or Iene) was a rainmaking and fertility rite in Romania, similar in some ways to &quot;Dodola&quot;. Its namesake is a clay effigy, whose sculpting, funeral, exhumation, and eventual destruction are centerpieces of the display. The source of this ritual, as is the case with those of many other local popular beliefs and practices, precedes the introduction of Christianity, although it came in time to be associated with Orthodox Easter or with the Feast of the Ascension. In some variants it was performed on a precisely calculated day two to three weeks after Easter, though local communities could also revive it at other times of the year, specifically during drought. The figurine was generally made from clay and most often by girls, though sometimes also by boys or married women; the ceremony itself would draw in the whole village community as spectators, and, in isolated cases, also had active participation from the Romanian Orthodox clergy. The mimicry of Christian funerals was widespread, but absent from the more established forms of the ritual.

Before dying out in the 1990s, the &quot;Caloian&quot; tradition had possibly survived for millennia, and may have originated with Dacian strands of Paleo-Balkan mythology. It evoked memories of human sacrifice for the appeasement of rain deities, with parallel near-sacrifices of girls being still attested in rural Romania during the first half of the 20th century. The &quot;Caloian&quot; litany, which exists in various arrangements as a sample of primitive Romanian literature, usually refers to the figure being sent off to the skies to unlock rain, and buried so that it may be reborn. The figurine&#x27;s mother is hinted at in such poems, and in some cases played by one of the girls attending the funeral procession.

&quot;Caloian&quot; events were largely confined to Muntenia, Oltenia and Northern Dobruja (the southern part of Romania), though they have been well attested in specific parts of Western Moldavia. Similar practices, assigning usually female characteristics and names to the clay figurine, are spread throughout other parts of the Romanian-speaking areal. They form a continuum of traditions with both &quot;Dodola&quot; and &quot;Germenchuk&quot;, which are staples of Bulgarian folklore. Intermingling with the latter is attested in &quot;Caloian&quot;″s primary spread along the Danube, but also in its supposed etymology, which reveals either a Slavonic term for &quot;dirt&quot; or a folkloric nod to Ioannitsa (Ioniță) Kaloyan. The ritual has also been adopted and adapted by ethno-cultural minorities, including the Gagauz and the Csángós.

==Ritual==
===Spring variant===
&quot;Caloian&quot; had a spring version, which often occurred on the &quot;third Tuesday after Easter&quot;, and concluded on the following Thursday. Folklorists Ion H. Ciubotaru an Silvia Ciubotaru write that having fixed days for &quot;Caloian&quot; during Easter was &quot;wholly exceptional&quot; in a Moldavian context; they also indicate one other variant in which &quot;Caloian&quot; coincided with the first Thursday after Easter. As noted by ethnologist Anca Ceaușescu, this variant was specifically a fertility rite, which was mostly tied to spring and renewal, rather than to the celebration of Easter itself. She records instances where &quot;Caloian&quot; was performed on the sixth week after Easter, on Thomas Sunday, or &quot;always around May 8&quot;. Children up to the age of 12 were preferred for performing the ritual, owing to their &quot;ritual purity&quot;, and in some cases only selected to fit into an odd number. Performers are most often described as young girls, and sometimes boys, though folklorist Teodor Burada, who speaks from a Western Moldavian perspective, also records the occasional involvement of married women. According to Ciubotaru and Ciubotaru, a situation idealized in the more traditional forms of the &quot;Caloian&quot; was that in which the people involved were girls around the age of nine, or adolescent virgins, who were either sisters or first cousins. Men remained strictly prohibited for most of &quot;Caloian&quot;″s history.

Depending on the communities involved, the &quot;Caloian&quot; was regarded as an infant, a grown child, or an adult. His effigy was put together from fresh yellow clay, and sometimes also mud, old rags, or wax. The latter two variants are described by the Ciubotarius as modern improvisations. In most versions, the end result would reach in length, though some stood as tall as &quot;a seven-year-old child.&quot; As Burada notes, the &quot;Caloian&quot; makers made sure to present it in a mortuary pose, with hands crossed on the chest; sometimes, a secondary figure, the &quot;female&quot; &quot;Caloiță&quot;, would be added. Also according to Burada, the clay would be adorned with basil and the red-colored shells of Easter eggs, then placed inside a small coffin. The Easter egg variant remained well attested in the local culture of Niculițel, though other accounts refer to the &quot;Caloian&quot; being dressed in flowers and made to hold up a candle; a cross was placed near its head. Moldavian variants make ample and &quot;homeopathic&quot; use of plants which grow on or near bodies of water—reeds, but also burdock, dwarf elder, butterbur, and fleaworts. Folklorist Ion I. Drăgoescu reported a form of the ritual as seen in Potlogi, where the &quot;Caloian&quot; (known here exclusively as &quot;Caloiță&quot;) is made from dough, and its coffin carved out of a pumpkin shell.

The group would then proceed to bury the &quot;Caloian&quot; &quot;outside the village, either out in the shrubland, or in some secluded area of the woods, or alongside a body of water, if such are located within proximity of the village.&quot; In some documented cases, the burial spot was specifically chosen as the line separating two villages or at crossroads, which were also &quot;mythical places, spaces allowing for the communication between two worlds&quot;. The choice of such locations &quot;enhances the magic in the act of burial&quot;. In the oldest variants, Christian symbolism is scarcely present in the funeral ceremony, and the procession is limited to girls wearing leaves of dwarf elder for clothes. During the ceremony as witnessed by Burada, a girl would act and dress as the officiating priest, while another one would hold up the ceremonial flag (&quot;prapur&quot;), comprising a tall stick and a white handkerchief. The cortege would include mourners, who perform a mock-litany. The Romanian Academy&#x27;s treatise on Romanian literature (&quot;Istoria literaturii romîne&quot;, 1964) describes this as sung to &quot;its own tune, a syllabic one, almost recitative in its rhythm.&quot; The spring variant, as recorded in Burada, reads:

Some informants and some variants of the rhyme are specific about the burial being done to ensure regeneration. They address the &quot;Caloian&quot; with reassurances such as &quot;we put you into the ground so that you&#x27;ll turn green&quot;. Other forms include more classical litanies, mourning the &quot;Caloian&quot;″s &quot;little girly body&quot; (&quot;trupușor de cuconiță&quot;). In such variants, girl mourners rubbed onion slices over their eyes, to produce genuine tears.

In Burada&#x27;s account, the &quot;Caloian&quot; was left buried for the following Wednesday, with the group returning on Thursday for the exhumation. The recovered figurine was either broken up into small pieces that were taken back to the village and thrown into wells, or left intact in its coffin and set down on a river to be carried downstream. In one of the fixed-date Moldavian variants, the figurine was always dug out on the Feast of the Ascension. Another variant of the ritual, attested in Fântâna Doamnei, had it buried in a field of green wheat and exhumed at Saint George&#x27;s Festival (April 23), which, according to folklorist Mihai Pop, underscores &quot;Caloian&quot;″s function as an agrarian fertility rite. The &quot;Caloian&quot;″s departure or destruction was followed by a large and joyous feast, attended by all the villagers and known as &quot;pomana Caloianului&quot; (&quot;alms of the &quot;Caloian&quot;&quot;). As noted by Burada, this final part of the ceremony lasted into Friday morning, and specifically involved &quot;Lăutari&quot; performers; in some parts of the country, working the field on &quot;Caloian&quot; Tuesday afternoon was virtually a taboo. A folk dance, the &quot;Caloian&quot; hora, was sometimes performed by those attending the feast.

===Drought ritual===
The &quot;Caloian&quot; was also revived in rainmaking rituals that could take place later in the year, specifically &quot;on days that follow several dry weeks, when it&#x27;s sultry and the earth gets scorched by drought&quot;; ethnologist Mihaela Bucin argues that, even as a spring ritual, the &quot;Caloian&quot; was implicitly associated with rainmaking. Progressively, the celebration was reduced in scope to a rain ritual, by confusion with other festivals, and sometimes to stop heavy rainfall as well. Ethnographer Ion Ghinoiu also proposes that the exhumation and destruction portion of some rituals may have originated with people angered by the continuation of drought: &quot;Perhaps at an earlier stage the &quot;Caloian&quot; was only exhumed on the third day only if no rain had followed its burial [...]. These two rites were then contracted as one, and the latter became a mere sequence of the former.&quot; Contrarily, the Ciubotarus propose that breaking up the effigy was done to prevent excessive rain, and also that it represented an attenuated human sacrifice. They refer to first-hand accounts from the early 20th century which described adolescent girls, dressed up in funeral attire, being hurled into Moldavian rivers by other youth, and barely surviving the experience. A transition between the human version and the &quot;Caloian&quot; is attested in Lișna, where young villagers created human-sized dolls, or &quot;zâne&quot;, which they pretended were real girls that have to be kidnapped and buried in order to end droughts.

One informant suggested in 1949 that &quot;Caloian&quot; (known to her as &quot;Iene&quot;) was only ever performed in times of drought, usually on weekends, and with no day of rest in-between (though &quot;sometimes, preparation are made throughout the week ahead&quot;). In this version, the body was either directly buried near a well or allowed to float downstream on a river, with the coffin as a raft that also held up lit candles. If the latter, any other children encountered along the route were sprayed with water. This feature was reversed in other villages, where the procession itself could expect to be sprayed with water by onlookers. A variant attested in Călmățui had the figurine buried in grains of wheat or barley, whereas in Tudor Vladimirescu the ceremony closely followed regular church burials, including funeral services provided by a Romanian Orthodox priest, and a dedicated grave in the village cemetery. The custom in mixed Csángó–Romanian communities such as Oituz, which was under Catholic influence, is that the figurine be buried near a wayside cross.

With or without the burial, the rainmaking ritual closely mimicked attested practices for Easter-time (including alms which attracted the village in its entirety), with the song performed being a notable exception. It has several &quot;relatively unitary&quot; variants, including one cited by Burada:
Other such variants of the litany begin with a mother&#x27;s search for her &quot;Caloian&quot;. Sometimes, one of the girls involved in the procession performs this role in front of the public, with the others pointing to her as they chant. As noted by Pop, they resemble in this the folk ballad &quot;Miorița&quot;, as well as Christmastime &quot;colinde&quot;—pointing to a recurring theme in &quot;ancient Romanian poetry&quot;. As described by Ceaușescu, these are also the oldest rhymes connected to the burial ritual, and are specific in describing the figurine as a &quot;mediator between the people and the sky above&quot;. The drought &quot;Caloian&quot; as performed around Bucharest used one such specific variant, in the southern Muntenian dialect:
The exhortation is sometimes addressed not just to &quot;Caloian&quot;, but also to the community&#x27;s dead, most often ones who died recently and at a young age. In some cases, the song is extended by lamentations which depict in detail the sufferings of drought-afflicted villagers. One version from Broscăuți, in a divergent Moldavian subdialect, reads:
==Cultural significance==
===Religious and historical connections===

The &quot;Caloian&quot; is one of several burial ceremonies present in Romanian folklore—Pop draws parallels with the chasing out of the &quot;Brezaia&quot; doll at Christmas and New Years&#x27;, or with the symbolic burial of a ceremonial leader at &quot;Junii Brașoveni&quot; feasts. As &quot;one of the most archaic elements covered by the folk Calendar&quot;, &quot;Caloian&quot; itself may be deeply connected to the mythological lore of ancient cultures. &quot;Istoria literaturii romîne&quot; described &quot;Caloian&quot; as one of several songs or chants which serve to &quot;mirror forms of [social] life that lead us back to the patriarchal village as it was at the dawn of the feudal era&quot;, and more particularly &quot;descriptions of ceremonials or rites.&quot; Further: &quot;the &quot;Caloian&quot; was, at least up to a point, the reification of an old concept regarding the Oriental god of nature, who dies and is resurrected.&quot;

As early as 1883, pioneer ethnologist Gheorghe Săulescu discussed similarities between &quot;Caloian&quot; and &quot;Dodola&quot;, whom he respectively knew as &quot;Calian&quot; and &quot;Papaluga&quot;. In Săulescu&#x27;s reading, both were originally &quot;national gods&quot; of the Romanians. This approach linked &quot;Calioan&quot; with interest in Paleo-Balkan mythology. More specifically, Burada proposed that &quot;Caloian&quot; originated with the pre-Christian Dacians in Northern Dobruja (Scythia Minor). Drăgoescu argues for the same reading, reviewing the practice as &quot;pre-Christian, agrarian&quot;, and ultimately a remnant of Dacian material culture. Contrarily, other scholars place the &quot;Caloian&quot;″s roots in Roman Dacia, with imitations of the &quot;Argei&quot; cult. Beginning with the writings of Marcu Beza, researchers have focused on the death-and-rebirth component of the practice, drawing connections between the &quot;Caloian&quot; and various religions of the Ancient Near East—with specific focus on Dumuzid and Attis. Ciubotaru and Ciubotaru describe &quot;Caloian&quot; as &quot;perhaps Thracian&quot;, and note parallels with both Attis and Dumuzid—but also with Baldr, Xipe Totec and Yarilo; the ritual in its details, they note, closely resembles one found among the Shapsugs. Writer Victor Eftimiu argues that &quot;Caloian&quot;″s immediate origin is in Slavic paganism, as a localized rendition of the Morena cult; instead, folklorist Mihail Vulpescu highlights parallels with the Adonis cult. Ceaușescu proposes a generic reading of the figurine itself as an &quot;effigy of the rain god&quot;. 

There is also significant overlap between the Romanian &quot;Caloian&quot; and &quot;Germenchuk&quot;, present in Bulgarian folklore, with which southern Romanian traditions are fully contiguous. Though &quot;Gherman&quot; is attested as an alternative for &quot;Caloian&quot; in Muntenia, some other Romanian iterations of the ritual have no known correspondent in any culture. The name of &quot;(S)caloian&quot;, whether or not indicative of its origin, is probably a borrowing from Greek onomastics; comparatist Francis Lebrun noted the existence of a &quot;Khaloïánnis&quot; (Χαλοΐάννης) song in Greek folklore, proposing that it shares traits with the Romanian ritual. Linguist Petre Coman verified the existence of the word &quot;loián&quot;, used for &quot;rain&quot; in the dialectal Romanian of Măcin. Another linguist, George Giuglea, noted its partial synonymy with the Albanian &quot;llohë&quot; (&quot;sleet&quot;) and the Romanian &quot;noian&quot; (&quot;deluge&quot;). Giuglea further argued that a once-significant spread of &quot;loián&quot; would explain &quot;(S)caloian&quot;, specifically its &quot;idea of rain, of water&quot;.

The name referring to both figurine and ritual has also attracted attention for its hypothetical connections with the Second Bulgarian Empire, which controlled territories on both sides of the Danube. Philologist Vasile Bogrea sees &quot;Caloian&quot; as originally a likely reference to a 12th-century Bulgarian Tsar, Ioannitsa (Ioniță) Kaloyan, polemically known in Greek as &quot;Skyloioannes&quot; (which would explain contexts in which &quot;Scaloian&quot; is used). However, Bogrea cautions that the origin may prove to be the Romanian noun &quot;(s)căluș&quot;, which would link &quot;Caloian&quot; with the &quot;Călușari&quot; fraternity. Geographer Constantin Brătescu uses &quot;Caloian&quot; rituals in Northern Dobruja as evidence &quot;that a rather wide area&quot; of Northern Dobruja was inhabited by proto-Romanian Vlachs during Ioannitsa&#x27;s empire. In 2017, ethnologists Delia-Anamaria Răchișan and Călin-Teodor Morariu indicated the origin of the name in the Slavonic &quot;kalŭ&quot; (калъ), meaning &quot;dirt&quot;, though also noting that &quot;some have correlated the practice with the name of Tsar Ioniță&quot; or derived it from John the Baptist. The Slavonic derivation had also been proposed earlier by Pericle Papahagi and Ion Aurel Candrea, who suggest &quot;kale an&quot; (&quot;yellow clay&quot;).

===Spread and transformation===
Săulescu was the first to record the &quot;Caloian&quot; as he witnessed it in Western Moldavia. In 1915, Burada was aware of it existing only in &quot;certain villages&quot; of Muntenia—Brăila, Buzău, Ialomița counties—and only one locality of Western Moldavia—namely Hermeziu, Iași County. To these he added Northern Dobruja&#x27;s Tulcea County—with the figurine, exclusively known here as &quot;Scaloian&quot;, being disposed off on the Danube. &quot;Caloian&quot; and its variants were only known in certain parts of Transylvania, and were never popular there, possibly owing to a very specific interdiction being enforced during the Reformation—known to have been applied against the &quot;Călușari&quot;, by 1675. Ethnologist Pamfil Bilțiu notes that an unnamed rainmaking ritual was nevertheless always practiced in that region, into the late 20th century. According to Bilțiu, it was still recognized by the old women of Leordina and other villages in Maramureș County, who recalled figurines being made out of either cloth or clay. Meanwhile, the custom had spread out to eastern peripheral areas: one 1920 report notes the &quot;Caloian&quot; being practiced by the Gagauz and Romanians of Vulcănești, in Bessarabia (now Gagauzia, Republic of Moldova). 

According to Pop, the ritual had a &quot;much larger area&quot; than usually acknowledged, though derivatives such as &quot;Muma ploii&quot; (&quot;Mother of Rain&quot;), in Oltenia, and &quot;Cheloșag&quot; at Ferești in Western Moldavia. As he notes, &quot;Muma ploii&quot; also involves a burial ceremony and litanies which &quot;seem to be only variants of the &quot;Scaloian&quot; songs.&quot; Ciubotaru and Ciubotaru refer to the same issue in noting that &quot;Caloian&quot; and its most archaic forms appear in southernmost Moldavia, whereas heterodox varieties take precedence in rural areas situated more to the north, including some areas of Bukovina. Examples include &quot;Ploița&quot; and &quot;Ploițica&quot; (&quot;Rainy Girl&quot;) in Focuri, &quot;Păpușa&quot; (&quot;Doll&quot;) in Horodniceni, and &quot;Mama secetei&quot; (&quot;Mother of Drought&quot;) in Heleșteni and Santa Mare. Late adoption correlates with the usage of common female names, as is the case with &quot;Aglăița&quot; of Concești and Havârna, &quot;Catrina&quot; of Lungani, and &quot;Maricica&quot; of Vorona. &quot;Caloian&quot;-related customs appearing under various guises were also scrutinized and discussed by other folklorists. They note (as with Adrian Fochi) that &quot;Caloian&quot; should be seen as one specific incarnation of a ritual which mostly employs feminine figurines under many other names, including &quot;Caloiana&quot;, &quot;Ploaia&quot; (&quot;The Rain&quot;), and &quot;Maica Călătoarea&quot; (&quot;Mother Traveler&quot;). Specifically in Oltenia, the female figurine was asked to ensure plentiful rainfall, whereas a male one, &quot;Tatăl Soarelui&quot; (&quot;Sun&#x27;s Father&quot;), was buried next to her to ensure that the rains would also stop. These twin burials could also garner approval from the Orthodox clergy—at Leu, the mock-funeral involved passing through the churchyard. West of Transylvania, the Romanians of Hungary had &quot;no recollection of the &quot;Caloian&quot;&quot;. They marked a festival known as &quot;Paștele morțîlor&quot; (&quot;Easter of the Dead&quot;), in which they hurled eggshells into rivers, and also had &quot;Păpărugă&quot; as a localized &quot;Dodola&quot;; some fashioned &quot;Muma ploii&quot; on a separate occasion, using only clay that had been used to build a cob oven.

Pop argues that &quot;Caloian&quot; rituals were carefully maintained in certain communities by the more traditional folk, as &quot;customs whose continued practice was of vital interest to the entire community&quot;, and &quot;not at all child&#x27;s play&quot;; despite this, he reports that &quot;Caloian&quot; had died out by 1999, when his research was published. Similarly, Răchișan and Morariu note that, like both the &quot;Dodola&quot; and the &quot;Caloian&quot; stand as &quot;agrarian customs practiced by children to benefit the community, and should not be mistaken for children&#x27;s games.&quot; According to Ceaușescu, the practice only degenerated into &quot;children&#x27;s folklore&quot; because of advances in agriculture, which rendered its sacred functions socially irrelevant. 

In 1973, Valeriu Anania published his play &quot;Greul Pământului&quot; (&quot;Weight of the Earth&quot;, or &quot;Pregnancy with the Earth&quot;), which is a mythopoeia of &quot;Caloianul&quot; as the &quot;Vlach myth&quot;. Anania depicts Tsar Ioannitsa as a Vlach hero whose death is necessary for the survival of his kin, and whose burial under the Vlachs&#x27; main citadel consolidates their presence in history. The play also fictionalizes the origins of &quot;Io&quot;, once used as an introductory title by Romanian rulers, suggesting that it is the &quot;seed&quot; of Ioannitsa&#x27;s name, and a recollection of his sacrifice. Anania&#x27;s work was followed in 1975 by Ion Lăncrănjan&#x27;s novel, &quot;Caloianul&quot;, which alludes to the clay doll as an existential metaphor—the protagonist, Alexandru Ghețea, is shown to be dying a &quot;great&quot; death, like a &quot;creation of smooth clay.&quot; Such imagery was invoked by Ion Gheorghe in his 1976 poetry volume, &quot;Noimele&quot; (&quot;The Meanings&quot;). The ritual&#x27;s name was also revived by Romanian wine producers, with &quot;Crama Oprișor&quot; marketing as &quot;Caloian&quot; its &quot;Fetească neagră&quot;, rosé and Merlot varieties.

<text>A combe (; also spelled coombe or coomb and, in place names, comb) can refer either to a steep, narrow valley, or to a small valley or large hollow on the side of a hill; in any case, it is often understood simply to mean a small valley through which a watercourse &quot;does not&quot; run.

The word &quot;combe&quot; derives from Old English &quot;cumb&quot; and is unrelated to the English word &quot;comb&quot;. From Middle English coumbe, cumbe, from Old English cumb, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *kumbaz; compare Dutch kom (“bowl, basin”), German Kump (“vessel”). Related to Welsh cwm (“a hollow valley”), of identical meaning, through Proto-Indo-European *ḱumbʰ-. 

Today, the word is used mostly in reference to the combes of southern
and southwestern England.

==Examples==
The following is a list places in the British Isles named for having combes:

<text>Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) is a public historically Black university in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. It enrolls nearly 2,500 students in 28 undergraduate programs and 4 graduate programs and is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the University of North Carolina system.

==History==
Elizabeth City State University was established by the North Carolina General Assembly on March 3, 1891, as the State Colored Normal School at Elizabeth City, in response to a bill calling for the creation of a two-year Normal School for the &quot;teaching and training [of] teachers of the colored race to teach in the common schools of North Carolina.&quot; Peter Weddick Moore was its first leader. The school provided training for teachers of primary grades.

The campus quadrangle and six surrounding buildings are included in the Elizabeth City State Teachers College Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

In 1937, the school made the transformation into a full four-year teachers college and was officially named Elizabeth City State Teachers College, while expanding its role to include the training of principals as well. In 1939, the college awarded its first bachelor of science degrees in its program of elementary education. Within the following twenty-five years, the college expanded its offerings to include a vocational-technical program and a total of thirteen academic majors.

In December 1961, the college gained membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1963 its name was changed to Elizabeth City State College. In 1969, its name was changed to Elizabeth City State University to reflect expansion and the addition of graduate programs. When the University of North Carolina System was formed in 1972, ECSU became one of the system&#x27;s sixteen constituent universities and entered into its current phase of development and organization. ECSU is home to the only four-year aviation science degree program in North Carolina.

In 2020, Elizabeth City State received $15 million from MacKenzie Scott. Her donation is the largest single gift in the university&#x27;s history.

<text>Tower Park is a leisure and retail park, located at Mannings Heath, in Poole, Dorset, England. It was one of the first complexes of its kind in Europe when it opened in 1989.

==History==
The leisure park, which opened in 1989, was a development initiated by local Dorset businessman Bill Riddle, who operated a landfill site in the area. The site chosen for the park was at Mannings Heath, on 53 acres of heathland just outside Poole. Riddle funded the project by selling some land at Mannings Heath to Tesco and much of the park was leased to Allied Leisure PLC.

Tower Park was initially very successful as the quality of its attractions and free parking proved popular. The original attractions included a 10-screen UCI cinema, Megabowl (a 30-lane bowling alley), &quot;Ice Trax&quot; skating rink, Splashdown Waterpark and an 1,850-capacity nightclub called &quot;The Venue&quot;, which became one of the leading ‘superclubs’ in the country.

However, within three years of opening, the park went into Administration as a consequence of the early 1990s recession. Although the complex as a whole was rescued by its sale to Tower Park Properties, neither the &quot;Ice Trax&quot; skating rink nor &quot;The Venue&quot; nightclub proved to be commercially viable in the longer term. &quot;Ice Trax&quot; closed in the mid-1990s and &quot;The Venue&quot; in 1999. The latter did briefly re-open in 2002, but the re-launch did not last.

A Tesco supermarket store was also built at Tower Park. In 2002 it was discovered that a petrol leak from the store’s filling station had been polluting local groundwater for six months. The company was fined by the Environment Agency, although Tesco claimed it had been treated unfairly.

In 2003, Tower Park was sold to X-Leisure, a company headed by PY Gerbeau, which added it to its Xscape brand. The following year X-Leisure invested £5m in refurbishing and expanding the facilities in the park, including adding additional restaurant units. These included Pizza Hut, Nando’s and KFC. The existing buildings were also given new cladding and an open plaza created between Splashdown and the cinema, allowing the new restaurants to have outside seating. A newly rebuilt Burger King restaurant was opened in 2005, the original restaurant having been destroyed by a disgruntled Burger King employee in an arson attack 18 months earlier.

The cinema was sold to Empire Cinemas in 2004 along with five other UCI theatres in other parts of the UK. Empire added an additional six screens and 500 seats in 2011, making the cinema one of the biggest multiplexes in the south of the country. In 2016, it was sold to Cineworld together with four other Empire cinemas. Gala Bingo, which had taken over &quot;Ice Trax&quot; premises in the mid-90s, was re-branded as Buzz Bingo in 2018. In 2014, a chemical spill at the Splashdown Waterpark resulted in hundreds of people being evacuated from the attraction.

In 2013, X-Leisure was taken over by the UK’s largest property development and investment Group, Landsec. Tower Park continues to be listed by Landsec as one of its leisure properties on its website.

In late 2024, Tower Park will undergo a multi-million-pound refurbishment.

==Attractions and amenities==
The buildings at Tower Park occupy an area of 199,000 sq. ft., according to its ultimate owner Landsec. There is an open plaza between the buildings providing outdoor seating. There is also a ground level free car park with disabled spaces.

The attractions include a Cineworld 16-screen multiplex cinema, a Splashdown Waterpark with 13 outdoor and indoor flume rides, Buzz Bingo, Lemur Landings children’s softplay, Hollywood Bowl bowling alley, and a PureGym health club. In addition, food outlets and restaurants include, according to Tower Park’s website, Burger King, KFC, Nando’s, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Pizza Express. A Tesco superstore is also located at Tower Park.

<doc id="428147" wikidata="Q5599610" url="?curid=428147" title="1840 Natchez tornado">
<text>The Great Natchez tornado was a deadly and &quot;powerful&quot; (the tornado may have been an F4-F5) tornado that hit Natchez, Mississippi, on Thursday, May 7, 1840. The tornado was the second-deadliest tornado in United States history; at least 317 people were killed and at least 109 were injured. While officially unrated, it is retrospectively estimated to have been at least a violent F4 tornado on the Fujita scale. Its , path was marked by severe damage and uncertain estimates of casualties, though many enslaved Africans—possibly numbering in the hundreds—reportedly died on plantations in Louisiana.

== Event description ==
This massive tornado formed approximately twenty miles southwest of Natchez, shortly before 1 p.m., and moved northeast along the Mississippi River. It followed the river directly, stripping forests from both shores. The vortex then struck the river-port of Natchez Landing, located below the bluff from Natchez. This windstorm tossed 116 flatboats (of the 120 docked at Natchez that day) into the river, drowning their crews and passengers. Other boats were picked up and thrown onto land. A piece of a steamboat window was reportedly found from the river. Many doing business on shore were also killed. At Natchez Landing, the destruction of dwellings, stores, steamboats and flatboats was almost complete. It then moved into the town of Natchez, though its full width of devastation also included the river and the Louisiana village of Vidalia. It was reported, &quot;the air was black with whirling eddies of walls, roofs, chimneys and huge timbers from distant ruins ... all shot through the air as if thrown from a mighty catapult.&quot; The central and northern portions of Natchez were slammed by the funnel and many buildings were completely destroyed. Forty-eight people were killed on land, and 269 others were killed on the river.

Numerous other deaths may have occurred further along the path as the tornado struck rural portions of Concordia Parish, Louisiana as well. The &quot;Free Trader&quot; stated, &quot;Reports have come in from plantations 20 miles distant in Louisiana, and the rage of the tempest was terrible. Hundreds of (slaves) killed, dwellings swept like chaff from their foundations, the forest uprooted, and the crops beaten down and destroyed. Never, never, never, was there such desolation and ruin.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
The final death toll was 48 on land (with 47 deaths in Natchez and one in Vidalia) and 269 on the river, mostly from the sinking of flatboats. In addition to the 317 deaths, only 109 were injured, a testament to the tornado&#x27;s intensity. The tornado is to this day ranked as the second deadliest in American history, and caused $1,260,000 in damage. The actual death toll may be higher than what is listed, as slave deaths were often not counted during this time period.

Senate Document No. 199 (27th Congress, 2nd Session) was the report of the commission to fix the demarcation between the United States and the Republic of Texas. In the Journal of the Joint Commission under date of May 26, 1840, at page 62 of said document, is written the following:
&quot;We crossed to-day the path of a recent tornado, which had prostrated trees and cane on the river banks. Its course was observed to be from south 72 degrees west to north 72 degrees east, and the track to be from wide. This was supposed to be the same tornado which occasioned such dreadful destruction of human lives and houses in Natchez on the 7th of May.&quot; These observations were made on the Sabine River, which is the boundary between Louisiana and Texas.

Regarding a final death count, CNN reported &quot;The official death toll may not have included slaves, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.&quot;

<doc id="428148" wikidata="Q227894" url="?curid=428148" title="Passalidae">
<text>Passalidae is a family of beetles known variously as &quot;bessbugs&quot;, &quot;bess beetles&quot;, &quot;betsy beetles&quot;, &quot;betsy bugs&quot;, or &quot;horned passalus beetles&quot;. Nearly all of the 500-odd species are tropical; species found in North America are notable for their size, ranging from 20 to 43 mm, for having a single &quot;horn&quot; on the head, and for a form of social behavior unusual among beetles.

Bodies are elongate-cylindrical and black overall; ventral surfaces may be covered with yellow setae. The head is narrower than the thorax, with antennae consisting of 10 antennomeres with a three-segment club. The elytra are elongate with parallel sides, and heavily striated.

They are quasisocial (common nest + brood caring) beetles that live in groups within rotting logs or stumps. The beetles will excavate tunnel systems within rotting wood where the females then lay their eggs. They care for their young by preparing food for them and helping the larvae construct the pupal case. Both adults and larvae must consume adult feces which have been further digested by microflora for a time; an arrangement that might be described as a sort of external rumen.

They are also able to produce fourteen acoustical signals, more than many vertebrates. Adults produce the sounds by rubbing the upper surface of the abdomen against the hind wings. The larvae produce the sounds by rubbing the third leg against a striated area on the coxa of the second leg.

While the taxonomy of Nearctic species is well-known (four species in the US, and 90 in Mexico), bess beetles in other parts of the world need further study.

Of North American species, &quot;Odontotaenius disjunctus&quot; (&quot;synonym: Popilius disjunctus&quot;) is the familiar bessbug found throughout the eastern US and Canada, while &quot;O. floridanus&quot; has only been found in Florida on sand hills that used to be islands when Florida was flooded thousands of years ago. &quot;Ptichopus angulatus&quot; was recently discovered near the border of Mexico in Arizona. Its habitat is south to Colombia and it is commonly associated with the detritus chambers of leafcutter ant nests (&quot;Atta&quot; spp.). Two other species were reported from Arizona at the beginning of the 20th century, but have not been seen there since that time; they may have been brought from Mexico by a train hauling firewood.

The oldest records of the family go back to the Cretaceous, with the genus &quot;Ceracyclus&quot; known from two species found in the Cenomanian aged Burmese amber; the genus appears to be closely related to the living genus &quot;Cylindrocaulus&quot;. The family has been suggested to have a close relationship with the extinct family Passalopalpidae.

<text>Thomas James Lawless (born December 19, 1956) is an American former Major League Baseball player who played between and , appearing with the Cincinnati Reds, Montreal Expos, St. Louis Cardinals, and Toronto Blue Jays.

He was the interim manager of the Houston Astros in 2014.

==Career==
Lawless grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania, attending Strong Vincent High School and Penn State Behrend, where he played baseball from 1975 to 1978.

Lawless became famous in when he became the only player ever traded for Pete Rose.

Lawless, who only hit two regular-season home runs in his career, is also remembered for his dramatic go-ahead home run in Game 4 of the 1987 World Series (he had hit .080 in 25 at-bats during the regular season.) Lawless later expressed shock that he had managed to hit a home run. &quot;When it went over the wall, I thought, &#x27;Holy cow, it went out.&#x27; I went blank. I don&#x27;t remember flipping the bat.&quot;

On May 10, 1989, while with the Toronto Blue Jays, Lawless&#x27; ninth-inning single broke up a no-hit bid by Mark Langston of the Seattle Mariners.

A fast and highly skilled baserunner, Lawless struggled to hit major league pitching and retired in 1990. He entered the coaching ranks and has become a successful minor league manager. In 2007, he served as a coach for the China national baseball team during its participation in Major League Baseball&#x27;s Instructional League program and in the Arizona Fall League. He managed the Lexington Legends, the Class A affiliate of the Houston Astros, for the 2009 season. On November 16, 2009, Lawless was named the new manager for the Lancaster JetHawks, the Class A Advanced affiliate of the Houston Astros, for the 2010 season. In 2011, Lawless was managing the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Texas League. On September 1, 2014, after the Astros fired Bo Porter, Lawless was hired as the interim manager. As interim manager with Houston, he had a record of 11 wins and 13 losses.

<text>An added tone chord, or added note chord, is a non-tertian chord composed of a triad and an extra &quot;added&quot; note. Any tone that is not a seventh factor is commonly categorized as an added tone. It can be outside the tertian sequence of ascending thirds from the root, such as the added sixth or fourth, or it can be in a chord that doesn&#x27;t consist of a continuous stack of thirds, such as the added thirteenth (six thirds from the root, but the chord doesn&#x27;t have the previous tertian notes – the seventh, ninth or eleventh). The concept of added tones is convenient in that all notes may be related to familiar chords.

Inversions of added tone chords where the added tone is the bass note are usually simply notated as slash chords instead of added-tone chords. For example, instead of Cadd2/D, just C/D is used.

An added tone such as fourth voiced below the root may suggest polytonality. The practice of adding tones may have led to superimposing chords and tonalities, though added tone chords have most often been used as more intense substitutes for traditional chords. For instance a minor chord that includes a major second factor holds a great deal more dramatic tension due to the very close interval between the major second and minor third. Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s polytonal &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; contains many added tone chords.

==Mixed third chords==

A mixed third chord, also &quot;split-third chord&quot;, includes both the major and minor thirds (e.g. C–E–E–G), although the thirds are usually separated by an octave or more. A minor chord above a major chord of the same root has a diminished octave (major seventh) separating the thirds and is more common, while a major chord above a minor chord of the same root has a very dissonant augmented octave (minor ninth) separating the thirds and is not as commonplace. Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; is an example of the use of a split-third chord, as are many of William Schuman&#x27;s symphonies. It is also suggested by the final note and chord of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.

Mixed thirds caused by blue notes in blues, country music and rock music can be thought to form mixed third chords, such as in &quot;Rock And Roll Music&quot;. The dominant seventh sharp ninth chord&#x27;s major third and augmented ninth are enharmonically equivalent to a minor-over-major chord&#x27;s thirds, and the two can be somewhat interchangeable. Songs with a 79 chord include &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;.

==Other added tone chords==

Examples of the added-second chord or added-ninth chord (notated &quot;add2&quot;, &quot;2&quot; or &quot;add9&quot;) in popular music include The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;, Mr. Mister&#x27;s &quot;Broken Wings&quot;, Don Henley&#x27;s &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, The Police&#x27;s &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;The Flame&quot;, Lionel Richie&#x27;s &quot;All Night Long (All Night)&quot;, Men at Work&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Mistake&quot;, DeBarge&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot;, Starship&#x27;s &quot;We Built This City&quot;, Deniece Williams&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot;, and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The jazz rock group Steely Dan popularized a particular voicing of the add2 chord they dubbed the mu chord.

The added-fourth chord (notated &quot;add4&quot;) almost always occurs on the fifth scale degree where the added note is the key&#x27;s tonic note. Examples in popular music include the second chord in the verse of &quot;Runaway Train&quot; and the introduction of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;.

The added-sixth chord (notated &quot;6&quot;) is rarely inverted since it shares its notes with a seventh chord a minor third down (e.g. C6 has the same notes as an Am7), although a counterexample is The 5th Dimension&#x27;s recorded version of &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot; (on 5). It&#x27;s used only occasionally in rock and popular music, but examples include the third measure of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, the second chord of &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;, the third of &quot;The Eagle And The Hawk&quot;, and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Loves You&quot;. When added at the suggestion of Harrison, producer George Martin described the chord as old-fashioned sounding. An added-sixth chord ends songs including Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot;, Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;, Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;You Send Me&quot;, and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Loves You&quot;.

<text>In music, extended chords are certain chords (built from thirds) or triads with notes &quot;extended&quot;, or added, beyond the seventh. Ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords are extended chords. The thirteenth is the farthest extension diatonically possible as, by that point, all seven tonal degrees are represented within the chord (the next extension, the fifteenth, is the same as the root of the chord). In practice however, extended chords do not typically use all the chord members; when it is not altered, the fifth is often omitted, as are notes between the seventh and the highest note (i.e., the ninth is often omitted in an eleventh chord; the ninth and eleventh are usually omitted in a thirteenth chord), unless they are altered to give a special texture.

Chords extended beyond the seventh are rarely seen in the Baroque era, and are used more frequently in the Classical era. The Romantic era saw greatly increased use of extended harmony. Extended harmony prior to the 20th century usually has dominant function – as V9, V11, and V13, or V9/V, V13/ii etc.

Examples of the extended chords used as tonic harmonies include Wild Cherry&#x27;s &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; (either a dominant ninth or dominant thirteenth).

==Common practice period==
During the common practice period of Western classical music, composers orchestrating chords that are voiced in four or fewer parts would select which notes to use so as to give the desired sonority, or effect of the intended chord. Generally, priority was given to the third, seventh and the most extended tone, as these factors most strongly influence the quality and function of the chord. The root is never omitted from the texture. The third defines the chord&#x27;s quality as major or minor. The extended note defines the quality of the extended pitch, which may be major, minor, perfect, or augmented. The seventh factor helps to define the chord as an extended chord (and not an added note chord), and also adds to the texture. Any notes which happen to be altered, such as a flatted fifth or ninth, should also be given priority. For example: in a thirteenth chord, one would play the root, third, seventh, and thirteenth, and be able to leave out the fifth, ninth, and eleventh without affecting the function of the chord. The eleventh chord is an exception to this voicing, in which the root, seventh, ninth, and eleventh are most commonly used. 

In the classical practices of western music, extended chords most often have dominant function (dominant or secondary dominant), and will resolve in circle progression (down a fifth) in much the same way that V7, V7/ii, V/IV, etc. might resolve to their respective tonics. Extended chords can also be altered dominants, and the extended pitch may be altered in several ways (such as V flat 13 in a major key).

Following standard voice leading rules:

;V9 to I or i
*The third, which will also be the seventh scale degree, always resolves upward to tonic.
*The seventh resolves downwards stepwise to the third factor of the chord of resolution.
*The extended pitch will resolve downward.

;V11 to I or i
*The seventh resolves downwards stepwise to the third factor of the chord of resolution.
*The ninth resolves downwards stepwise to the fifth factor of the chord of resolution.
*The eleventh doesn&#x27;t move, and becomes the root of the chord of resolution.

;V13 to I or i
*The seventh resolves downwards stepwise to the third factor of the chord of resolution.
*The third, which will also be the seventh scale degree, always resolves upward to tonic.
*The thirteenth, will resolve downward to the tonic, and often includes a passing tone through the ninth factor of the chord of resolution. Less often, the thirteenth may also remain the same and become the third of the chord of resolution.

An important distinction between extended and added chords must be made, since the added tones and extended tones are enharmonic, but differ in function. Extended chords always have at least one octave between their lowest pitch, and extended note, otherwise the extended factor would be considered an added pitch. Extended chords usually must be resolved when used in a dominant function, whereas added chords are most often textures added to a tonic.

==History==
===18th century===

In the 18th century, ninth and eleventh chords were theorized as downward extensions of seventh chords, according to theories of supposition.

In 1722, Jean-Philippe Rameau first proposed the concept that ninth and eleventh chords are built from seventh chords by (the composer) placing a &quot;supposed&quot; bass one or two thirds below the fundamental bass or actual root of the chord. With the theoretical chord F–A–C–E–G–B the fundamental bass would be considered C, while the supposed bass would be F. Thus the notes F and A are added &quot;below&quot; a seventh chord on C, C–E–G–B, triadically (in thirds). This is also referred to as the &quot;H chord&quot;.

The theory of supposition was adopted and modified by Pierre-Joseph Roussier, Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg, and other theorists. A. F. C. Kollmann, following Johann Kirnberger, adopted a simpler approach and one closer to that prevalent today, in which Rameau&#x27;s &quot;supposed&quot; bass is considered the fundamental and the ninth and eleventh are regarded as transient notes inessential to the structure of the chord. Thus F–A–C–E–G–B is considered a seventh chord on F, F–A–C–E, with G and B being nonchord tones added &quot;above&quot; triadically.

===19th century===
In 19th-century classical music the seventh chord was generally the upper limit in &quot;chordal consonance&quot;, with ninth and eleventh chords being used for &quot;extra power&quot; but invariably with one or more notes treated as appoggiaturas. The thickness of complete ninth, eleventh or thirteenth chords in close position was also generally avoided through leaving out one or more tones or using wider spacing (open position).

===20th century===
In the 20th century, especially in jazz and popular music, ninth chords were used as elaborations of simpler chords, particularly as substitutes for the tonic triad at the end of a piece. The &quot;piling up&quot; of thirds above the tonic to make seventh, ninth, eleventh, or even thirteenth chords &quot;is one of the most important characteristics of jazz harmony&quot;. Vítězslav Novák&#x27;s student Jaroslav Novotný (1886–1918) used a fifteenth chord in the fourth song of his 1909 song cycle &quot;Eternal Marriage&quot;.

==Chord structure==
Building on each of the major scale degrees the thirteenth chord chord quality that is harmonic to such scale (i.e. with all its notes belonging to such scale), results in the following table. The numbering is relative to the scale degree numbers of the major scale that has the major scale degree in question as tonic:

Other thirteenth chord qualities do exist but they do not belong to any mode of the major scale. 

From the table it is clear that adding an eleventh or a thirteenth makes the seven chord qualities distinguishable from each other, as without an eleventh added the I and IV chord quality would be identical, and without a thirteenth added the ii and vi chord quality would be identical.

==Jazz, jazz fusion and funk==
Jazz from the 1930s onward, jazz fusion from the 1970s onward and funk all have been seen to use extended chords as a key part of their sound. In these genres, chords often include added ninths, elevenths and thirteenths as well as their altered variations. In jazz and jazz fusion, compositions consist of complex chord progressions in which many of the chords are extended chords and in which many of the dominant seventh chords are altered extended chords (e.g., A7add911 or D7911). Funk also uses altered extended chords, but in this genre, pieces are usually based on a vamp on a single chord, because rhythm and groove are the key elements of the style. When extended chords are voiced in jazz or jazz fusion, the root and fifth are often omitted from the chord voicing, because the root is played by the bass player.

<text>Douglas Reagan Ault (March 9, 1950 – December 22, 2004) was an American professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter who played for the Texas Rangers (1976) and Toronto Blue Jays (1977–1978, 1980). He is best known for hitting the first two home runs in Blue Jays history, in the team&#x27;s first Major League Baseball (MLB) game on April 7, 1977, a 9–5 Toronto win against the Chicago White Sox.

==Career==
A native of Beaumont, Texas, Ault was a varsity baseball star at Texas Tech. He was drafted three times in the MLB Draft, but refused to sign. He was finally signed by the hometown Rangers in 1973 as an amateur free agent. He advanced relatively quickly though the minor League hierarchy, making the majors in 1976 as a late season replacement. With Mike Hargrove at first base, Ault became available in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft where he was drafted by the Blue Jays. He became the starting first baseman in their first regular season game, and his actions that day turned Ault into the Blue Jays first superstar. However, he did not meet the expectations set for him, had an otherwise average career, and was out of the majors within three years.

He managed in the minor Leagues for several years, leading the Syracuse Chiefs to a pennant in 1985. He retired in 1994, and went to the automobile business, but a series of personal tragedies and business failures plagued him in later life. Ault committed suicide on December 22, 2004.

==Playing career==
Doug Ault was born in Beaumont, Texas. When he was young, Ault credited his eldest sister Brenda as his main influence in baseball, for training him every day at the local baseball park and attending all his games as an amateur. He was varsity baseball star at Texas Tech. He was drafted on three occasions, by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1969, the San Diego Padres in the second round in the 1970 January secondary draft, and by the Cleveland Indians in the 1970 June secondary draft, but never signed. While at Texas Tech he hit .473 his senior year and was named to the 1972 College Baseball All-America Team.

He was signed by the Rangers in 1973 as an amateur free agent. He was sent to Gastonia in the Western Carolina League where he led the league in home runs with 19 in his first season playing professionally. Within the next few years, Ault became a top prospect. In 1976, Ault played in 143 games for the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League leading the league in runs with 112 and total bases (278) while finishing third in home runs (25), and hits (168). Meanwhile, he worked the off-season in an oil-platform.

==Major league career (1976–1980)==

===Texas Rangers (1976)===
Ault made his Major League Baseball debut with the Texas Rangers on September 9, 1976, and in his first at-bat, he struck out against Dave Goltz of the Minnesota Twins in the second inning. Ault later singled in the fifth inning off Goltz to record his first career hit. However, the Rangers lost to the Twins 6–0. Ault finished the season appearing in nine games with the Rangers, hitting .300 with six hits in 20 at-bats.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1977–1980)===
On November 5, the Toronto Blue Jays selected Ault with the 32nd overall pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft. He considered that day as &quot;grateful&quot; as it gave him an opportunity to play every day in the major leagues, as he was blocked at first base by All-Star Mike Hargrove while at Texas. During spring training, Ault competed with veterans Nate Colbert and Ron Fairly for the starting first base position.

On April 7, 1977, Ault was the Blue Jays&#x27; starting first baseman versus the Chicago White Sox, in the team&#x27;s first professional game. In bottom of the first inning, Ault, batting third in the lineup, slugged the first home run (and first hit) in Blue Jays&#x27; history off White Sox starting pitcher Ken Brett. He hit another home run off Brett in the third inning, tying a major league record for most home runs in an Opening Day game. Those were the first two home runs of Ault&#x27;s career (Ault also had an RBI single and a walk in the game), and the Blue Jays defeated the White Sox 9–5. George Bell of the Blue Jays broke the record when he hit three home runs on Opening Day in 1988, and was matched by Tuffy Rhodes of the Chicago Cubs in 1994 and Dmitri Young of the Detroit Tigers in 2005. Ault was covered with &quot;immediate acclaim and nationwide publicity&quot; as a result of the feat.

He finished his rookie season hitting .245 with 11 home runs and 64 runs batted in during 129 games. His 64 runs batted in tied Ault with Fairly to lead the Blue Jays in that category, and was a Blue Jays rookie record until Eric Hinske drove in 84 runs in 2002.

With the Blue Jays acquiring first baseman John Mayberry, Ault was limited to 54 games in 1978, in which he hit .240 with three home runs and collected seven runs batted in over 104 at-bats.

He spent the entire 1979 season with the Syracuse Chiefs, the Blue Jays Triple-A affiliate, before reappearing with the Blue Jays in 1980. In 64 games in 1980, Ault hit .194 with three home runs and fifteen runs batted in. All three home runs came against Cleveland at Municipal Stadium, in a series played in early August. Ault played his final career game with the Jays on October 5, 1980.

After his time with Toronto, Ault played with the Hanshin Tigers in the Japanese Central League in 1981, before returning to the Chiefs in 1982. Ault also spent some time with the Mexico City Tigres of the Mexican League in 1982.

Ault finished his career with a .236 batting average, hitting 17 home runs and recording 86 runs batted in, playing 256 games, 247 of them with the Toronto Blue Jays.

==Managing career==
Following his playing career, Ault served as a manager in the Blue Jays organization for the single-A teams Dunedin, Kinston, Myrtle Beach and St. Catharines. He was promoted to manage his former club, the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs of the International League in 1985, where he managed them to a pennant that same season, the first in club history. As a result, he won the International League Manager of the Year Award. He lasted with the Chiefs until 1987. In 1992, he won the South Atlantic League championship with the Myrtle Beach Hurricanes.

==Later life and death==
Ault and his first wife Julie had two children. They divorced in 1990. After the completion of his baseball managing career in 1994, Ault became a car salesman, first in Texas, then in Clearwater, Florida, where he moved to be closer to the Blue Jays spring training site.

He married his second wife, Lynn Marie, an obstetrician, in 2000. In 2002, she lost her medical license for violating Florida statutes regarding patient safety; a year later, she filed bankruptcy. In January 2004, their home in Tarpon Springs, Florida was sold though a bankruptcy proceeding, and they were separated for &quot;a while&quot;. A few months later, Ault&#x27;s first wife Julie died, after which he left his job at a Clearwater car dealership. According to some of his former teammates, at the time of his death &quot;things were not going great&quot; for Ault.

Ault died at his home in Tarpon Springs on December 22 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. It was ruled a suicide by the coroner&#x27;s office on December 28.

<doc id="428172" wikidata="Q107277492" url="?curid=428172" title="Sixth chord">
<text>The term sixth chord refers to two different kinds of chord, the first in classical music and the second in modern popular music.

The original meaning of the term is a &quot;chord in first inversion&quot;, in other words with its third in the bass and its root a sixth above it. This is how the term is still used in classical music today, and in this sense it is called also a chord of the sixth.

In modern popular music, a sixth chord is any triad with an added sixth above the root as a chord factor. This was traditionally (and in classical music is still today) called an &quot;added sixth chord&quot; or &quot;triad with added sixth&quot; since Jean-Philippe Rameau (&quot;sixte ajoutée&quot;) in the 18th century. It is not common to designate chord inversions in popular music, so there is no need for a term designating the first inversion of a chord, and so the term &quot;sixth chord&quot; in popular music is a short way of saying &quot;added sixth chord&quot;. There are three main types of added sixth chords: major sixth, minor sixth and minor flat sixth.

== Triad inversion ==

In early music, what is today called a &quot;sixth chord&quot; or &quot;first inversion&quot; in classical music was considered an autonomous harmonic entity with the root named by the bass, while it was later simply considered an inversion of a chord with the bass being the third (not the root) and the root being the sixth (not the bass). A first-inversion C major chord is shown below.

Alternatively, rather than as a six three chord, the note may be analyzed as a suspension or appoggiatura, &quot;first resolved and later... retained as a part of the chord, no resolution taking place.&quot;

The dominant chord&#x27;s fifth may be substituted by the chord&#x27;s sixth, analyzed as its thirteenth:

== Added sixth chords ==
In jazz, what is called a &quot;sixth chord&quot; was traditionally called an &quot;added sixth chord&quot;. As the name suggests, this is a triad with an added sixth interval. 

=== Major sixth ===
The major sixth chord is a major triad and the additional sixth interval is major. For example, a major sixth chord built on C (denoted by C6, or CM6) consists of the notes C, E, G, and the added major sixth A.

These are the same notes as those of an A minor seventh chord – whether such a chord should be regarded as an added sixth chord or a seventh depends on its context and harmonic function. To explain the analyses as added sixth chords, against common practice period theory, provides the example of the final tonic chord of some popular music being traditionally analyzable as a &quot;submediant six-five chord&quot; (added sixth chords by popular terminology), or a first inversion seventh chord (possibly the dominant of the supertonic V/ii). According to the interval strengths of the added sixth chord, the root of the strongest interval of the chord in first inversion (CEGA), the perfect fifth (C–G), is the root (C).

=== Minor sixth ===
The minor sixth chord (sometimes: &quot;minor major sixth&quot;, or &quot;minor/major sixth&quot;) consists of a minor triad with a tone added a major sixth above the root. Thus in C, it contains the notes C, E, G, and A.

This chord might be notated Cm6, CmM6, Cmin/maj6, Cmin(maj6), etc. Note that Cm6 has the same notes as F9 with the root omitted, i.e. the notes F (omitted), A, E, C, and G. These notes form a tetrad with several enharmonic equivalents: C–E–G–A might be written as Cm6, F9, F9 (no root), Am75, B79, AMaj79, or Balt. Many jazz chord charts use these chord notations indiscriminately, particularly in the choice of minor sixth versus dominant ninth chords. Thus, in some cases when a Cm6 is indicated, the F9 is in fact a better harmonic choice, i.e. closer to the composer&#x27;s harmonic intent; or vice versa. Analysis of the movement of the root, in the presence of dominant-functioning harmonies, will generally indicate which enharmonic chord is the appropriate notation choice. In some cases, the harmony is ambiguous.

Unlike the major sixth chord which is often substituted for a major triad, the minor sixth is more versatile and plays a number of different harmonic roles due to its identity as an inversion of the half-diminished seventh chord. The presence of the perfect fifth interval over the root also means that this voicing is more stable than the half-diminished seventh chord. An extension of the concepts of major and minor to tetrads, referred to as otonality and utonality respectively, considers this chord to be the utonality to the dominant seventh chord.

=== Minor flat sixth ===
The minor flat sixth chord is a minor triad and the additional sixth interval is minor, which is referred to as a flat sixth. Thus in C, it contains the notes C, E, G, and A.

This chord might be notated Cm6. It also shares identity as an inversion of the major seventh chord.

==In popular music==

Instances of the sixth chord crop up in popular music towards the end of the 19th century, for example in Johann Strauss II’s &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; waltz. Richard Taruskin sees Strauss’s use of the added sixth chord as the “one stylistic idiosyncrasy… that went from him into the general idiom of European (or European-style) music, and that is the freedom with which the sixth degree of the scale is harmonized.” 
The sixth chord was a common feature of the harmony of jazz and popular music during the entire twentieth century. One of the attractions of the chord is its tonal ambiguity. The harmony contains within it aspects that are both major and minor. Kurt Weill’s song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; from the &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; (1928) uses the chord from the start, resulting in &quot;a sort of bitonality: A minor in the melody, C major in the harmony.&quot;

The trombone riff that opens Glenn Miller’s &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot; (1940) is a well-known example from the Swing era. Later popular songs that feature sixth chords include: The Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Loves You&quot; (1963), &quot;Help!&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; (1967), Arthur Kent and Sylvia Dee&#x27;s &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot; (1968), The Young Rascals&#x27; &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; (1967), Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (1975), Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Bad Sneakers&quot; (1975) and Styx&#x27;s &quot;Babe&quot; (1979).

The minor flat sixth chord is arpeggiated in the first chord of the dungeon music from the first Legend of Zelda game.

==In classical music==
An unusual use of this chord at the start of a work occurs in Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in E major, Op 31 No. 3 (1802):
According to Denis Matthews, &quot;the most striking moment in the sonata is its opening, where an ambiguous added-sixth chord on the subdominant resolves itself through a series of halting steps, rhythmically and harmonically, towards the tonic.&quot;

In the opening section of his Fantasy-Overture, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Tchaikovsky uses the minor added sixth chord to striking effect:

Debussy frequently used the sixth chord, for example in his piano prelude &quot;General Lavine-Eccentric&quot; (1913), whose idiom alludes to the popular idioms of cakewalk and ragtime of the early 1900s. The following passage &quot;is in F major; its seeming pentatonicism (C–D–F–G–A) is found to be the outline of the tonic added sixth chord, plus the G as passing tone…&quot;

Maurice Ravel’s 1920 ballet &quot;La Valse&quot;, which contains subtle echoes of the late 19th century Viennese Waltz, incorporates added sixth chords in its harmony:

The timeless, meditative closing bars of Gustav Mahler’s song &quot;Abschied&quot; from &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; (1909) fully exploit the expressive power and ambiguity of the sixth chord. &quot;The final sonority, the famous added-sixth chord, is particularly ingenious... because it fuses the two principal keys of &quot;Das Lied&quot; (A minor and C major).&quot;

Alban Berg’s Violin Concerto (1935) ends with a &quot;tonic triad of B flat, with added sixth [that] follows a harmonic progression found frequently in 1930s dance-band arrangements.&quot; However, Richard Taruskin points out that Berg&#x27;s &quot;chord thus created, B flat, D, F, G had an important poetic resonance&quot;, as it echoes the ending of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Abschied.&quot; Stravinsky’s &quot;Symphony in Three Movements&quot; (1945) &quot;incorporates elements of American popular music, most famously the final chord, a Hollywood added-sixth chord of ever there was one.&quot; (Stravinsky himself later criticized his choice of the final D sixth chord as ‘commercial.’ ) Messiaen’s &quot;Louange à l’immortalité de Jésus&quot;, the final movement of his &quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot; (1941) opens with a meditative theme &quot;played entirely over a 6-4 chord with added sixth&quot; 

==Special kinds of sixth chords==
The &quot;Neapolitan sixth&quot; is the first inversion of a major triad built on the flattened supertonic (second degree of the scale) – a Neapolitan sixth in C major, therefore, consists of the notes F, A, and D.

There are a number of &quot;augmented sixth&quot; chords. Each of them has a major third and augmented sixth above the bass. When these are the only three notes present, the chord is an &quot;Italian sixth&quot;; when an augmented fourth is added above the bass, the chord is a &quot;French sixth&quot;; while adding a perfect fifth above the bass of an Italian sixth makes it a &quot;German sixth&quot; (the etymology of all these names is unclear). All usually have the (sixth degree of the scale, A in C major, for example) as the bass note – in this case, they tend to resolve to the dominant.

==Sixth factor==
The sixth factor of a chord is six scale degrees above the root. Conventionally, the sixth is third in importance to the root, fifth, and third, being an added tone. It is generally not allowed as the root since that inversion resembles a seventh chord on the sixth rather than an added tone on the original note. In jazz chords and theory, the sixth is required due to it being an added tone.

The quality of the sixth may be determined by the scale or may be indicated. For example, in a major scale, a diatonic sixth added to the tonic chord will be major (C–E–G–A) while in minor it will be minor (C–E–G–A).

The sixth is octave equivalent to the thirteenth. If one could cut out the notes in between the fifth and the thirteenth and then drop the thirteenth down an octave to a sixth, one would have an added sixth chord (C–E–G–B–D′–F′–A′ minus B–D′–F′ = C–E–G–A).

<doc id="428187" wikidata="Q2737369" url="?curid=428187" title="Mark Hendrickson">
<text>Mark Allan Hendrickson (born June 23, 1974) is an American former baseball and basketball player. Hendrickson was a pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) and played power forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Continental Basketball Association (CBA). He is one of just 13 athletes to play in both MLB and the NBA, and the most recent to do so. He is a former pitching coach for the Aberdeen IronBirds.

Hendrickson is notable for his size, at . Hendrickson was a ground ball pitcher, with a fastball in the high 80s and a decent 12–6 curveball. Hendrickson also had a 10–4 slider, but his slider only reached the high 70s to low 80s. Thus, when Hendrickson had success, it was due to control, movement, and location and not power.

==High school career==
Hendrickson was a three-sport standout in tennis, basketball, and baseball at Mount Vernon High School in the state of Washington. During his sophomore year, he was a member of the state championship baseball team and the runner-up state basketball team. He was a member of the state championship basketball team during his junior year, where he earned recognition as the co-MVP of the tournament for his play. He was also named team captain, team MVP, and named to the All-Area and All-State teams. A tennis state qualifier, Hendrickson was also named to the baseball All-Area team.

As a senior, Hendrickson led the Bulldogs to a second basketball championship. He was team captain, team MVP, All-Area, All-State, and the state basketball tournament MVP. For his performance on the basketball court, he was named the Gatorade State Player of the Year. In addition to his remarkable basketball play, he was able to help his team win the state championship in baseball, while also qualifying for state in tennis. He was named the Skagit Valley Herald Athlete of the Year both his junior and senior years.

==College career==
Hendrickson starred in both basketball and baseball at Washington State University.

In basketball, he was a two-time selection to the All-Pac-10 first team and he ranks second in Washington State history in rebounds. He averaged 13.9 points per game and 8.6 rebounds per game during his four years at Washington State. He was also selected to All-Conference teams in baseball.

==NBA and MLB drafts==
The first time Hendrickson was drafted by a baseball team was right after high school when he was selected in the 13th round of the 1992 draft by the Atlanta Braves, but chose to attend college instead. He was also drafted, but did not sign, by the San Diego Padres in the 21st round of the 1993 draft, by the Atlanta Braves again in the 32nd round of the 1994 draft, by the Detroit Tigers in the 16th round of the 1995 draft, and by the Texas Rangers in the 19th round of the 1996 draft.

Upon his college graduation he was selected by the NBA&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers (31st overall pick) of the 1996 draft and MLB&#x27;s Toronto Blue Jays (20th round) of the 1997 draft.

==Professional basketball career==
Hendrickson elected to play basketball and joined the Philadelphia 76ers, playing in 29 games in the 1996–97 NBA season, averaging 2.9 points and 3.2 rebounds in 10.4 minutes per game. He signed as a free agent with the Sacramento Kings on December 23, 1997, appearing in 48 games, averaging 15.4 minutes, 3.4 points and 3.0 rebounds as a reserve player.

Unsigned by the NBA prior to the 1998 season, he signed with the La Crosse Bobcats of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) where he played most of the season. He was picked up by the New Jersey Nets for a couple of brief stints during the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons and by the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 1999–2000 season. Frustrated by his inability to get more consistent work, he decided to give up on basketball and concentrate on baseball.

During his NBA career Hendrickson appeared in 114 games, and recorded 381 points and 316 rebounds.

==Minor league baseball career==
He continued to play semi-pro baseball in the offseason (in York, Pennsylvania) while he was playing basketball and eventually signed with the Blue Jays on May 22, 1998, electing to play minor league baseball during the summer while continuing his basketball career. During this period, he pitched for the Blue Jays Single-A affiliate in Dunedin in 1998 (4–3, 2.37 ERA, 16 games, 5 starts) and the Double-A Tennessee Smokies in 1999 (2–7, 6.63 ERA, 12 games, 11 starts).

In 2000, after abandoning basketball and turning to baseball full-time, he had to refocus his energies on his baseball career. &quot;I was always around baseball,&quot; he commented, &quot;but what a lot of people don&#x27;t realize, and what I didn&#x27;t realize is that I didn&#x27;t put in the time and dedication into knowing how to get my arm into shape, how to take care of it, and how to pitch on a regular basis.&quot;

He started off the 2000 season back at Dunedin (2–2, 5.61 ERA, 12 starts, one complete game), but was promoted to the Double-A Tennessee Smokies (3–1, 3.63 ERA, six starts). He spent the next two seasons with the Triple-A SkyChiefs (2–9, 4.66 ERA, 38 games, six starts in 2001; 7–5, 3.52 ERA, 14 starts in 2002).

==Major League Baseball career==

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Hendrickson made his major league debut for the Blue Jays on August 6, 2002, against the Seattle Mariners as a reliever. It was a rather bleak first appearance. He worked of an inning and allowed 5 runs. The Jays stuck with him and he made his first career start on September 7 against the Boston Red Sox, pitching 5 scoreless innings in a game the Jays lost 4–1. His first victory came in his next start, on September 14 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, when he worked six innings, allowed one run and the Jays won 8–4.

He returned to the rotation at the start of the 2003 season and stayed there all year, accumulating a 9–9 record with a 5.51 ERA in 30 starts, with one complete game shutout. Hendrickson is the first pitcher in Toronto Blue Jays history to hit a home run, which he did against the Montreal Expos on June 21, 2003.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
On December 14, 2003, he was traded by the Blue Jays along with Sandy Nin to the Colorado Rockies for Justin Speier. The Rockies immediately flipped him to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Joe Kennedy. He became a regular member of the Devil Rays&#x27; rotation, accumulating records of 10–15 (4.81 ERA) in 2004, 11–8 (5.90 ERA) in 2005, and 4–8 (3.81 ERA) in the first half of 2006.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 27, 2006, along with catcher Toby Hall in exchange for Dioner Navarro, Jae Weong Seo and minor league outfielder Justin Ruggiano. He immediately joined the Dodgers&#x27; starting rotation, but ineffectiveness caused him to be moved to the bullpen for the end of the season, where he was more effective. His final 2006 numbers with the Dodgers were 2–7, 4.68 ERA in 18 appearances, 12 as a starter. In 2007, he was both a starter and a reliever for the Dodgers, showing more effectiveness out of the bullpen. Hendrickson was not offered a contract by the Dodgers and became a free agent on December 12, 2007.

===Florida Marlins===

On January 16, 2008, Hendrickson signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Florida Marlins. On June 9, 2008, Ken Griffey Jr. hit the 600th home run of his career off a fastball thrown by Hendrickson in the 1st inning of a 9–4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds.

On July 7, the Marlins announced that Hendrickson, along with Ryan Tucker, would be moved to the bullpen to make room in the rotation for Josh Johnson and Chris Volstad.

===Baltimore Orioles===
On December 31, 2008, Hendrickson signed a one-year deal for the 2009 season with the Baltimore Orioles. He was re-signed for the 2010 season. While with the Orioles, Hendrickson was mostly a relief pitcher, but he made a few starts. On September 11, 2009, he picked up his only major league save by throwing three shutout innings against the New York Yankees. He saved the win for starting pitcher Chris Tillman. The Orioles declined his option for the 2011 season, making him a free agent. However, he later agreed to a minor league deal with the Orioles. This deal included an invitation to big league spring training. In February 2013, he returned to the Orioles organization on a minor league contract. He elected free agency on November 4.

===York Revolution===
On March 29, 2014, Hendrickson signed with the York Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. In 55 games 52.2 innings of relief he went 2–0 with a stellar 1.54 ERA with 34 strikeouts and 9 saves.

===Baltimore Orioles (second stint)===
On February 10, 2015, Hendrickson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Baltimore Orioles. He was released on March 16.

Hendrickson retired from baseball on March 31, 2015.

Hendrickson is one of 13 athletes that played in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. The 13 are: Danny Ainge, Frank Baumholtz, Hank Biasatti, Gene Conley, Chuck Connors, Dave DeBusschere, Dick Groat, Steve Hamilton, Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts and Howie Schultz.

==Pitching style==
Hendrickson threw four pitches: a four-seam fastball, a curveball, a changeup, as well as a cutter. His fastball varied from 87 to 91 MPH. Hendrickson&#x27;s curveball had little movement, and sits around 71–76 MPH. His changeup was not very effective, as the 82–84 MPH velocity did not differ enough from his fastball. Hendrickson&#x27;s cutter was his best pitch and it sat around 82–87 MPH.

==Baseball coaching career==
Hendrickson was announced as the Aberdeen IronBirds&#x27; new pitching coach on February 27, 2017.

<doc id="428188" wikidata="Q3934800" url="?curid=428188" title="Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel">
<text>Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel, 8th Earl of Surrey ( 1313 – 24 January 1376) was an English nobleman and medieval military leader and distinguished admiral. Arundel was one of the wealthiest nobles, and most loyal noble retainer of the chivalric code that governed the reign of Edward III of England.

== Early life==
Richard was born c. 1313 in Sussex, England. Fitzalan was the eldest son of Edmund Fitzalan, 2nd Earl of Arundel, and his wife Alice de Warenne. His parents married after 30 December 1304, after his father had initially been fined for refusing to marry Alice in 1304; their betrothal had been arranged by Alice&#x27;s grandfather the Earl of Surrey, his father&#x27;s guardian. Arundel changed his mind after the Earl died, leaving Alice the heiress presumptive, and with her only brother married to a ten-year-old girl. His maternal grandparents were William de Warenne and Joan de Vere. William was the only son of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (himself the son of Maud Marshal by her second marriage), and his wife Alice de Lusignan (died 1256), half-sister of Henry III of England.

== Civil career ==

Around 1321, Fitzalan&#x27;s father allied with Edward II&#x27;s favourites, Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester and his namesake son, and Richard was married to Isabel le Despenser, daughter of Hugh the Younger. Fortune turned against the Despenser party, and on 17 November 1326, Fitzalan&#x27;s father was executed. He did not succeed to his father&#x27;s estates or titles. However, political conditions had changed by 1330, and over the next few years, Richard was gradually able to reacquire the Earldom of Arundel as well as the great estates his father had held in Sussex and in the Welsh Marches.

Beyond this, in 1334 he was made Justiciar of North Wales (later his term in this office was made for life), in 1336 Constable of Portchester Castle (until 1338), and in 1339 High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire and Governor of Caernarfon Castle for life. He was one of the most trusted supporters of Edward the Black Prince in Wales.

== Naval and military service during the Hundred Years&#x27; War ==

Despite his high offices in Wales, in the following decades, Arundel spent much of his time fighting in Scotland (during the Second Wars of Scottish Independence) and France (during the Hundred Years&#x27; War). In 1337, Arundel was made joint commander of the English army in the north, and the next year he was made the sole commander. In September 1339 a French fleet appeared off Sluys, determined to make sail against Edward III&#x27;s fleet. When eventually they put to sea on 2 October they were blown off course by a violent storm back to the Zet Zwijn roads. Edward met Parliament, and they ordered a new fleet to be granted provisions by the barons of the cinque ports, and commanded by the Admiral of the West, Lord Arundel. Seventy ships from the west met at Portsmouth on 26 March 1340 to be commanded by their new admiral. The earl, granted the commission on 20 February 1340, was joined by fleets from the north and cinque ports. That summer he joined the king on flagship cog &quot;Thomas&quot;, leaving port two days later on 22 June for Flanders. Arundel was a distinguished soldier, in July 1340 he fought at the Battle of Sluys, during which his heavily laden cog grappled with the Spanish fleet. Summoned by Parliament on 13 July, he bore witness to the victory. By December 1342 Arundel had relinquished his post as admiral.

But it appears he may have been at the siege of Tournai. After a short term as Warden of the Scottish Marches, he returned to the continent, where he fought in a number of campaigns, and was appointed joint lieutenant of Aquitaine in 1340. The successful conclusion of the Flanders campaign, in which Arundel saw little fighting, encouraged the setting up of the Knights of the Round Table—attended every Whitsun by 300 great knights. A former guardian of the Prince of Wales, Arundel was also a close friend of Edward III, and one of the four great earls—Derby, Salisbury, Warwick and himself. With Huntingdon and Sir Ralph Neville, he was a Keeper of the Tower and guardian to the prince with a garrison of 20 men-at-arms and 50 archers. A royal councillor, he was expected to raise taxes, which had caused such consternation on 20 July 1338. The king&#x27;s wars were not always popular, but Arundel was a vital instrument of that policy. Despite the failure of the peace negotiations at Avignon in 1344, Edward was decided on protecting his Gascon subjects. In early 1345, Derby and Arundel sailed for Bordeaux as lieutenants of the duchy of Aquitaine, attempting to prevent Prince Jean&#x27;s designs on the tenantry. In August 1346 Derby returned with an army of 2,000 men; while Arundel was responsible for naval preparations.

=== Admiral of the West ===
On 23 February 1345 Arundel was made Admiral of the Western Fleet, perhaps for a second time, to continue the policy of arresting merchant ships, but two years later was again superseded. Arundel was one of the three principal English commanders at the Battle of Crécy, his experience vital to the outcome of the battle with Suffolk and the bishop of Durham in the rearguard. Throughout he was entrusted by the king as guardian of the young Prince Edward. Arundel&#x27;s division was on the right side of the battle lines, flanked to the right with archers, and stakes to the front.

He spent much of the following years on various military campaigns and diplomatic missions. The king himself and the entourage went to Winchelsea on 15 August 1350, set sail on the cog &quot;Thomas&quot; on the 28th, for the fleet to chase the Spaniard De la Cerda downwind, which they sighted the following day. The ships rammed before the party escaped unhurt on another vessel. Overcome by much larger Spanish ships, the English could not grapple.

In a campaign of 1375, at the end of his life, he destroyed the harbour of Roscoff. Only days after the death of Edward III, a Castilian fleet raided the south coast of England, and returned again in August. Arundel&#x27;s fleet had put into Cherbourg for supplies, but no sooner had it departed than the port was blockaded; one squadron was left behind and captured. At the same, time galleys harassed the coast of Cornwall.

== Great wealth ==
In 1347, he succeeded to the Earldom of Surrey (or Warenne), which even further increased his great wealth. He did not, however, use the additional title until after the death of the Dowager Countess of Surrey in 1361. He made very large loans to King Edward III but even so, on his death left behind a great sum in hard cash.

== Marriages and children ==
He married twice:
*Firstly, on 9 February 1321 at Havering-atte-Bower, to Isabel le Despenser (born 1312, living 1356, and died by 1374/5). At that time, the future earl was about seven, and his bride eight years old. Later he repudiated this bride and was granted an annulment by Pope Clement VI on 4 December 1344 on the grounds that he had been underage and unwilling. By this marriage, Richard and Isabel had one son (when Richard was fifteen, and Isabel sixteen):
** Sir Edmund de Arundel, Knt., of Chedzoy, Martock, Sutton Montagu, and Thurlbear, Somerset; Chudleigh, Devon; Melbury Bubb, Dorset; Bignor, Trayford and Compton, Sussex (c. 1329 – 1381/2) was the heir to the earldom of Arundel until he was rendered illegitimate by the annulment of his parents&#x27; marriage in December 1344. He married before 1347 (betrothed in January 1331 and married probably as a child), Lady Sybil de Montacute (or Montagu), daughter of William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury and Catherine Grandison, whose sister Elizabeth was married to his maternal uncle. Edmund protested his illegitimacy bitterly in 1347 but was apparently ignored. Edmund was subsequently knighted in 1352 at about twenty-three years of age and became an aristocratic knight owning numerous manors throughout the counties of Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Sussex. In 1364 Edmund was going to Flanders on the king&#x27;s service. In 1368 Pope Urban V sent him to King Edward III to communicate verbally &quot;the present state of the Roman church in Italy&quot;. In 1369 and 1370, Edmund fought in several military campaigns in France including the Battle of Pontvallain under the command of his second cousin once removed, Edward the Black Prince, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. After his father&#x27;s death in 1376, Edmund disputed his half-brother Richard&#x27;s inheritance of the earldom and associated lands and titles and apparently tried to claim the six manors allotted to his deceased mother. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1377, and finally freed through the intervention of two of his brothers-in-law (his wife&#x27;s brother John de Montacute and the second husband of Elizabeth de Montacute, Lady Le Despencer). Edmund, despite his persistent protests, lost his inheritance. In February 1381, Edmund went to Gascony on a military expedition. Sir Edmund de Arundel died before 12 February 1382. They had three daughters who were his co-heiresses and who brought a failed suit in 1382 against their half-uncle the Earl:
***Elizabeth (or Alice) de Arundel, who married Sir Leonard Carew (1343–1369) of Mohuns Ottery in Devon, feudal lord of Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire and lord of the manor of Moulsford in Berkshire. From Alice are descended all the members of the prominent and widespread Carew family, except Carew of Beddington in Surrey, descended from one of Sir Leonard&#x27;s great-uncles. (See Baron Carew, Earl of Totnes, Carew baronets.)
***Philippa de Arundel (died 13 September 1399), who married (as his 2nd wife) Sir Richard Sergeaux, Knt., of Colquite, Cornwall. A Victorian historical novel ascribes the following five children to her: 1. Richard, born 21 December 1376, and died childless, 24 June 1396; 2. Elizabeth, born 1379, wife of Sir William Marny; 3. Philippa, born 1381, wife of Sir Robert Pashley; 4. Alice, born at Kilquyt, 1 September 1384, wife of Guy de Saint Albino; 5. Joan, born 1393, died 21 February 1400. &quot;Philippa became a widow, 30 September 1393, and died 13 September 1399.&quot;
****Alice Sergeaux, later Countess of Oxford (c. 1386 – 18 May 1452), who married firstly Guy de St Aubyn of St. Erme, Cornwall, and secondly about 1406–7 (as his 2nd wife) the 11th Earl of Oxford and widower of Alice de Holand (d.s.p. 1406, niece of Henry IV), and by him was the mother of two sons:
*****John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford
***** Robert de Vere, whose grandson, John, became the 15th Earl of Oxford.
***Katherine de Arundel, who married Robert Deincourt.
*Secondly on 5 April 1345 he married Eleanor of Lancaster, a young widow, the second-youngest daughter and sixth child of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Maud Chaworth. By Papal dispensation he was allowed to marry his first wife&#x27;s first cousin by their common grandmother Isabella de Beauchamp. Eleanor was the widow of John de Beaumont, 2nd Lord Beaumont. The king, Edward III, himself a kinsman of both wives, attended this second marriage. By now, the Earl of Arundel had rebuilt the family wealth and was apparently a major financier of the Crown, and financial sweeteners may have been used to reconcile both the Church and the Crown. By this second marriage 5 February 1345, Richard and Eleanor had 3 sons and 3 surviving daughters:
**Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel, who was his son and heir.
**John Fitzalan, 1st Baron Arundel, 1st Baron Maltravers, who was a Marshall of England, drowned in 1379. The current Duke of Norfolk descends from Lady Mary, Duchess of Norfolk, a daughter and co-heiress of Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel; being a descendant of John FitzAlan, 1st Baron Arundel.
**Thomas Arundel, who became Archbishop of Canterbury
**Joan Fitzalan (1347 – 7 April 1419) who married Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford. They were the maternal grandparents of Henry V of England through their daughter Mary de Bohun.
**Alice FitzAlan (1350 – 17 March 1416), who married Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, matrilineal brother of King Richard II. They were ancestors to queen consorts Anne Neville (wife of King Richard III), Elizabeth of York (wife of King Henry VII) and Katherine Parr (wife of Henry VII&#x27;s son Henry VIII).

Illegitimate child by an unknown mistress:
*Eleanor Fitzalan, married in or before 1348 (as his 1st wife) John de Bereford of Clapcot, Berkshire, Bickford, Stonythorpe, and Wishaw, Warwickshire, an illegitimate son of Edmund de Bereford, Knt. They had no issue.

Probable illegitimate offspring include:
*Ranulph FitzAlan, who married a lady named Juliana, last name unknown. Through them descended the Hungerfords, the St. Johns and the Villiers, including Barbara (formerly Palmer) Villiers, the first of many mistresses of King Charles II of England.

==Death and legacy==

Richard died on 24 January 1376 at Arundel Castle, aged either 70 or 63, and was buried in Lewes Priory. He wrote his will on 5 December 1375. In his will, he mentioned his three surviving sons by his second wife, his two surviving daughters Joan, Dowager Countess of Hereford and Alice, Countess of Kent, his grandchildren by his second son John, etc., but left out his bastardized eldest son Edmund. In his will, Richard asked his heirs to be responsible for building the Fitzalan Chapel at Arundel Castle, which was duly erected by his successor. The memorial effigies depicting Richard Fitzalan and his second wife Eleanor of Lancaster in Chichester Cathedral are the subject of the poem &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot; by Philip Larkin.

Fitzalan died an incredibly wealthy man, despite his various loans to Edward III, leaving £60,000 in cash. He had been as astute in business as he had in diplomatic politics. He was a cautious man, and wisely saved his estate for future generations.

<text>Operation Headstrong involved the training of Afghan commandos in a grouping called the Afghan Special Narcotics Force (ASNF) by British special forces, including the Special Air Service, to seek out and destroy drug laboratories and to confiscate drug shipments. Britain later provided four helicopters for the ASNF&#x27;s use. British assistance to the ASNF amounted to £6.23 million in 2005–6, £9.4 million in 2006–7, and £32.5 million in 2007–8.

==Background==
Britain was the lead nation on counternarcotics in the Bonn Agreement and began forming a counternarcotics force known as Task Force 333, which would attack labs processing opium into crystal heroin. Elite Afghan units were trained and mentored by members of the British SAS.

==Operation==
The operation, dubbed Operation Headstrong was launched on 2 January 2004 with a raid on a heroin lab in northern Badakhshan.

By mid-2004, Force 333 had two operational units of 150 men each. One former Force 333 commander said that whenever the group hit a lab in the south of the country, they were guaranteed to get attacked, for example during a raid on a large lab in Bahramcha, Helmand Province, the lab owner called the local Taliban subcommander who ambushed the force. The ambush was so vicious the commander had to call in US air support to suppress it.

<text>The Southern Railway (SR), sometimes shortened to &#x27;Southern&#x27;, was a British railway company established in the 1923 Grouping. It linked London with the Channel ports, South West England, South coast resorts and Kent. The railway was formed by the amalgamation of several smaller railway companies, the largest of which were the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&amp;CR). The construction of what was to become the Southern Railway began in 1838 with the opening of the London and Southampton Railway, which was renamed the London &amp; South Western Railway.

The railway was noted for its astute use of public relations and a coherent management structure headed by Sir Herbert Walker. At , the Southern Railway was the smallest of the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies, the only one to operate entirely in England, and, unlike the others, the majority of its revenue came from passenger traffic rather than freight. It created what was at that time the world&#x27;s largest electrified railway system. There were two Chief Mechanical Engineers: Richard Maunsell between 1923 and 1937 and Oliver Bulleid from 1937 to 1948, both of whom designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace much of that which was inherited in 1923. The Southern Railway played a vital role in the Second World War, embarking the British Expeditionary Force, during the Dunkirk operations, and supplying Operation Overlord in 1944; because the railway was primarily a passenger network, its success was an even more remarkable achievement.

The Southern Railway operated a number of famous named trains, including the Brighton Belle, the Bournemouth Belle, the Golden Arrow and the Night Ferry (London–Paris and Brussels). The West Country services were dominated by lucrative summer holiday traffic and included named trains such as the Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. The company&#x27;s best-known livery was highly distinctive: locomotives and carriages were painted in a bright malachite green above plain black frames, with bold, bright yellow lettering. The Southern Railway was nationalised in 1948, becoming the Southern Region of British Railways.

==History==

=== Constituent companies and formation in 1923 ===

Four important railway companies operated along the south coast of England prior to 1923 – the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR), and the South Eastern Railway (SER) and the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). (The last two had formed a working union known as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) in 1899.) These companies were amalgamated, together with several small independently operated lines and non-working companies, to form the Southern Railway in 1923, which operated 2186 route miles (3518 km) of railway. The new railway also partly owned several joint lines, notably the East London Railway, the West London Extension Joint Railway, the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway and the Weymouth and Portland Railway.

The first main line railway in southern England was the London and Southampton Railway, (renamed LSWR in 1838), which completed its line in May 1840. It was quickly followed by the London and Brighton Railway (September 1841), and the South Eastern Railway (formerly the South Eastern and Dover Railway) in February 1844. The LSWR branched out to destinations including Portsmouth, Salisbury and later Exeter and Plymouth. It grew to be the largest of the four constituent companies. The LBSCR was a smaller railway than its LSWR neighbour, serving the port of Newhaven and several popular holiday resorts on the south coast and operating much of the south London suburban network. It had been almost bankrupt in 1867, but, during the last twenty-five years of its existence, it had been well-managed and profitable. It had begun to electrify routes around London (using an overhead line system) from 1909 to compete with the new electric trams that were taking away some of its traffic. Finally, the SECR had been created after years of wasteful and damaging competition between the two companies involved, with duplication of routes and services. Both companies had been unpopular with the travelling public and operated poorly-maintained vehicles and infrastructure. Nevertheless, real progress had been made in rectifying this during the period 1899–1922.

The formation of the Southern Railway was rooted in the outbreak of the First World War, when all British railway companies were taken into government control. Many members of staff joined the armed forces and it was not possible to build and maintain equipment at peacetime levels. After the war. the government considered permanent nationalisation, but instead decided on a compulsory amalgamation of the railways into four large groups through the Railways Act 1921, known as the Grouping. The resultant amalgamation of the four south coast railways to form the Southern Railway meant that several duplicate routes and management structures were inherited. The LSWR had most influence on the new company, although genuine attempts were made to integrate the services and staff after 1923. The rationalisation of the system led to the downgrading of some routes in favour of more direct lines to the channel ports, and the creation of a co-ordinated, but not necessarily centralised form of management, based at the former LSWR headquarters in Waterloo station.

In addition to its railway operations, the Southern Railway inherited several important ports and harbours on the south coast, including Southampton, Newhaven and Folkestone. It also ran services to the harbours at Portsmouth, Dover and Plymouth. These handled ocean-going and cross-channel passenger traffic and the size of the railway-owned installations reflected the prosperity that the industry generated. This source of traffic, together with the density of population served in the London suburbs, ensured that the Southern would be a predominantly passenger-orientated railway.

=== Electrification ===
In 1923, the Southern Railway took over route miles () of railway electrified with overhead line at 6.7 kV, 57 route miles () of railway electrified with a third rail at 660 V DC, and the long underground Waterloo &amp; City Railway. The route mileage of third rail electrification was to more than double in 1925 when the current was switched on on the routes to Guildford, and Effingham and the route from Victoria and to via and the Catford Loop. In 1926, electric trains started to run on the South Eastern Main Line route to Orpington and the three lines to using the 3rd rail system. On 9 August 1926, the Southern announced that the DC system was to replace the AC system and the last AC train ran on 29 September 1929. Including the London Bridge to East Croydon route, electrified in 1928, by the end of 1929, the Southern operated over route miles () of third rail electrified track and in that year ran 17.8 million electric train miles.

One new electrified line was built, the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway, being opened in 1929/1930. Most of the area immediately south of London was converted, together with the long-distance lines to Brighton, Eastbourne, Hastings (via the LBSCR line), Guildford, Portsmouth and Reading, between 1931 and 1939. On the former SECR routes, the lines to Sevenoaks and Maidstone were electrified by 1939. The routes to the Kent Coast were next in line for electrification and would have been followed by the electrification of the Southampton/Bournemouth route. The Second World War delayed these plans until the late 1950s and 1967 respectively. Although not in the Southern&#x27;s original plans, electrification was extended from Bournemouth to Weymouth in 1988.

=== Economic crisis of the 1930s ===
The post-Wall Street crash affected South Eastern England far less than other areas. The investment the company had already made in modernising the commuter network ensured that the Southern Railway remained in good financial health relative to the other railway companies despite the Depression. However, any available funds were devoted to electrification programme, and this marked the end of the first period under Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) Richard Maunsell when the Southern Railway led the field in steam locomotive design. The lack of funds affected the development of new, standardised motive power, and it would take until the Second World War for the Southern Railway to take the initiative in steam locomotive design once again.

=== Second World War ===

During the Second World War, the Southern Railway&#x27;s proximity to the Channel ports meant that it became vital to the Allied war effort. Holidaymakers using the lines to the Channel ports and the West Country were replaced by troops and military supplies, especially with the threat of a German invasion of the south coast in 1940. Before hostilities, 75% of traffic was passenger, compared with 25% freight; during the war roughly the same number of passengers was carried, but freight grew to 60% of total traffic. A desperate shortage of freight locomotives was remedied by CME Oliver Bulleid, who designed a fleet of 40 Q1 class locomotives to handle the high volumes of military traffic. The volume of military freight and soldiers moved by a primarily commuter and holidaymaker carrying railway was a breathtaking feat.

When the threat of invasion receded, the Southern Railway again became vital for the movement of troops and supplies preparing for the invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord. This came at a cost, as the Southern Railway&#x27;s location around London and the Channel ports meant that it was subjected to heavy bombing, whilst permanent way, locomotive, carriage and wagon maintenance was deferred until peacetime.

=== Nationalisation ===
After a period of slow recovery in the late 1940s, the war-devastated company was nationalised along with the rest of the railway network in 1948 and incorporated into British Railways. The Southern Railway retained a separate identity as the Southern Region of British Railways. The Southern Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity until it went into voluntary liquidation on 10 June 1949, having satisfied the requirements of sections 12, 13 and 24 of the Transport Act 1947 to ensure that all assets had been transferred to the British Transport Commission or otherwise properly distributed. Many lines in London and Kent had been damaged during the war and much rolling stock was either damaged or in need of replacement. Just prior to nationalisation, the Southern Railway had started a vigorous renewal programme, and this was continued throughout the early 1950s.

=== Revival in the privatised network ===

The former LBSCR routes to South London, Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire, from Victoria and London Bridge are now served by the current Southern. It was branded &quot;Southern&quot; on 30 May 2004, recalling the pre-nationalisation Southern Railway, with a green roundel logo with &quot;Southern&quot; written in yellow on a green bar. Southern is a subsidiary of Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). GTR is a subsidiary of Govia, which is a joint venture between the British Go-Ahead Group (65%) and French company Keolis (35%).

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 10 January 1923, shunter Frederick Harmer aged 23, was at work at Three Bridges railway station, Sussex when he slipped from boarding that was covering signal wires. Harmer fell onto the buffer of a wagon and was crushed fatally.
*On 5 November 1926, a milk tank train became divided near Bramshott Halt, Hampshire. The train crew failed to inform the signalman or protect its rear in the belief that the issue could be resolved quickly. A passenger train was in a rear-end collision with it. One person was killed.
*In March 1927, a train was derailed at Wrotham, Kent.
*In August 1927, a passenger train was derailed at Bearsted, Kent.
*On 24 August 1927, a passenger train was derailed at Sevenoaks, Kent due to a combination of the locomotive&#x27;s design and the condition of the track. Thirteen people were killed and 21 were injured.
*On 4 September 1934, two freight trains collided at Hither Green, London.
*On 25 May 1933, a passenger train was derailed at , London, coming to rest foul of an adjacent line. Another passenger train was in a sidelong collision with it. Five people were killed and 35 were injured. The accident was caused by a failure to implement a speed restriction on a section of track that was under maintenance.
*On 2 April 1937, an electric multiple unit crashed into the rear of another at , London due to a signalman&#x27;s error. Ten people were killed and eighty were injured, seven seriously.
*On 28 June 1937, a passenger train overran signals at , Kent and was diverted into a siding where it crashed into an electricity substation. Four people were killed. The train was not booked to stop at Swanley, but arrangements had been made for it to do so. However, the driver of the train had not been informed of these arrangements.
*In 1937, a boat train caught fire at , Hampshire due to an electrical fault in one of the carriages. Four carriages were destroyed.
*On 14 August 1940, a passenger train was derailed at , Hampshire due to enemy action. A bomb fell on the line in front of the train, which was unable to stop in time.
*On 11 May 1941, Cannon Street station was bombed in a Luftwaffe air raid. At least one locomotive was severely damaged.

== Geography ==

The Southern Railway covered a large territory in south-west England including Weymouth, Plymouth, Salisbury and Exeter, where it was in competition with the Great Western Railway (GWR). To the east of this area it held a monopoly of rail services in the counties of Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. Above all, it had a monopoly of the London suburbs south of the River Thames, where it provided a complex network of secondary routes that intertwined between main lines.

Unlike the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway and the GWR, the Southern Railway was predominantly a passenger railway. Despite its small size it carried more than a quarter of Britain&#x27;s passenger traffic because of its network of commuter lines around London, serving some of the most densely populated parts of the country. In addition, South London&#x27;s geology was largely unsuitable for underground railways, meaning that the Southern Railway faced little competition from underground lines, encouraging a denser network stretching from stations located in close proximity to central London.

=== Key locations ===
The headquarters of the Southern was in the former LSWR offices at Waterloo station and there were six other London termini at Blackfriars, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Holborn Viaduct, Victoria and London Bridge. The last of these also held the headquarters of the Eastern and Central Divisions. Other major terminal stations were at Dover, Brighton and Southampton. The railway also had one of Europe&#x27;s busiest stations at Clapham Junction.

Locomotives were constructed and maintained at works inherited from constituent companies at Eastleigh, Ashford and Brighton. The largest was Eastleigh, which was built by the LSWR in 1909 to replace the cramped Nine Elms Locomotive Works in South London. Brighton had been constructing locomotives since 1852 for the LBSCR, and built 104 of 110 Bulleid Light Pacifics between 1945 and 1951. Ashford was inherited from the SECR, and had been built in 1847, and was the works that constructed half of the SR Q1 class. Ashford completed its final locomotive in March 1944, a War Department Stanier 8F 2-8-0 number 8764.

Carriage works had also been inherited at Eastleigh, and Lancing (which had been built in 1912 for the LBSCR). During the Second World War, both were turned over to wartime production such as Horsa and Hamilcar gliders. Wagon workshops were situated at Ashford and Eastleigh.

A concrete works near Exmouth Junction locomotive shed made platform seats, fencing and station lamp posts. A power station was at Durnsford Road Wimbledon.

=== Engineering ===
The South West Main Line of the former LSWR between London and Southampton was completed by Joseph Locke with easy gradients, leading to several cuttings, tunnels and embankments across the Loddon, Test and Itchen Valleys, with brick arches constructed across South London to the site of Waterloo station. Such was the emphasis on minimising gradients that the stretch between Micheldever and Winchester has the longest constant gradient of any British main line.

The remainder of its area was traversed by three significant rows of hills: the North Downs, the Wealden Ridge and the South Downs. Thus Rastrick&#x27;s Brighton Main Line of 1841, included one of the largest cuttings in the country at Merstham, significant tunnels at Merstham, Balcombe, Clayton and Patcham as well as the famous Ouse Valley Viaduct. The major tunnels on the SECR network were at Merstham, Sevenoaks and Shakespeare Cliff.

== Operations ==

The running of the Southern was undertaken by the Board of Directors, the first chairman of which was Sir Hugh Drummond, appointed to the post in 1923. There were originally three general managers representing the interests of the three pre-Grouping railway companies: Sir Herbert Walker, Percy Tempest and William Forbes, although Walker was the sole occupant in the post within a year. The position of Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway was given to a former employee of the SECR, Richard Maunsell. For ease of administration, the lines inherited in 1923 were divided into three geographical sections with a Traffic Department for each, loosely based upon the areas covered by the amalgamated companies:

* The Western Section (former LSWR routes) included the South West Main Line, the Portsmouth Direct Line one quarter of the West Coastway Line (between Portsmouth and Southampton), and the West of England Main Line, both serving destinations popular with holidaymakers. It stretched into Devon and Cornwall as the line ran via Exeter, Okehampton and Plymouth, and this circuitous route was known derisively as the Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Withered Arm&quot; because the GWR had a stronger presence in this region.
* The Central Section (former LB&amp;SCR routes) included the Brighton Main Line (the most profitable and heavily used main line), the East Coastway Line, three-quarters of the West Coastway Line, the Arun Valley Line and the Sutton &amp; Mole Valley Lines.
* The Eastern Section (former SECR routes) included the South Eastern Main Line, the Chatham Main Line, the Hastings Line, the Kent Coast Line and the North Downs Line.

Operational and Commercial aspects of railway operation were brought under the control of Traffic Managers, relieving the General Manager of many tasks, allowing him to make policy decisions. Specialised Superintendents served under the Traffic Manager, breaking down the task of operating their respective sections. As such, the Southern Railway operated a hybrid system of centralised and decentralised management.

=== Passenger operations ===
:&quot;See also Named trains: UK&quot;

Passenger services, especially the intensive London suburban services, constituted the key breadwinner of the Southern Railway. The railway also served Channel ports and a number of attractive coastal destinations which provided the focus for media attention. This meant that the railway operated a number of famous named trains, providing another source of publicity for John Elliot. The Eastern and Central Sections of the network served popular seaside resorts such as Brighton, Eastbourne, Hastings and the Channel ports, whilst the Western Section catered for the heavy summer holiday traffic to the West Country resorts. Passenger services on the Southern Railway consisted of luxury Pullman dining trains and normal passenger services, which gave the railway a high total number of carriages at 10,800.

====Pullman services====
Pullman services were the premier trains of the Southern, reflecting the pride felt towards the railway. These luxury services included several boat trains such as the Golden Arrow (London-Paris, translated as Flèche d&#x27;Or for the French part of its route), The Cunarder (London – Southampton Ocean Liner service) and the Night Ferry (London – Paris and Brussels), the Brighton Belle on the Central Section, and the Bournemouth Belle and Devon Belle on the Western Section.

The Golden Arrow was the best-known train of the Southern Railway, and was introduced on 15 May 1929. The train consisted of Pullmans and luggage vans, linking London Victoria to Dover, with transfer to the French equivalent at Calais. The Brighton Belle, which had its origins in 1881 with the &#x27;Pullman Limited&#x27; of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, which renamed the service the &#x27;Southern Belle&#x27; in 1908. The train was steam-hauled until 1933 when electric units were introduced after the electrification of the London-Brighton Main Line. On 29 June 1934 the train was renamed the Brighton Belle and continued until withdrawal in 1972.

The SECR had introduced a Pullman train called the &quot;Thanet Pullman Limited&quot; from Victoria to Margate in 1921. The service was not a success and ceased to run in 1928. The service was however re-introduced by British Railways as the Thanet Belle in 1948.

====Titled trains====
Amongst the ordinary services, the Southern Railway also operated famous titled express trains such as the Atlantic Coast Express (&quot;ACE&quot;). With a large variety of holiday destinations including Bude, Exmouth, , Padstow, Plymouth, Seaton, Sidmouth and Torrington, the 11 am &quot;ACE&quot; from Waterloo, as the Atlantic Coast Express became known, was the most multi-portioned train in the UK from its introduction in 1926. This was due to sections of the train splitting at selected junctions for onward journey to their final destinations in the West Country. Padstow railway station in Cornwall was the westernmost point of the Southern Railway, and marked the end or beginning of the &quot;ACE&quot;, which was the longest timetabled journey on the network.

The importance of the destination dictated the motive power selected to haul each portion to their final destinations. Through carriages to East Devon and North Cornwall were invariably hauled by diminutive Drummond M7 tank locomotives, and from 1952, BR Standard Class 3 2-6-2T&#x27;s; the rest of the train continued behind a Bulleid Light Pacific to Plymouth. The final &quot;ACE&quot; was hauled on 5 September 1964 when the Western Section of the former Southern Railway network was absorbed into the Western Region of British Railways.

====Commuter services====

Inner London suburban services were fully electrified by 1929 and worked by electric multiple units of varying lengths according to demand, which had the advantage of rapid acceleration and braking. The railway then began a successful programme to electrify its most heavily used main lines, building up a substantial commuter traffic from towns such as Guildford, Brighton and Eastbourne.

====Other passenger services====
The remainder of passenger operations were non-Pullman, reflecting the ordinary business of running a passenger railway. West Country services were dominated by lucrative summer holiday traffic and passengers wishing to travel to the Isle of Wight and further afield. In winter months, the western extremity of the Southern Railway network saw very little local use, as the railway served sparsely populated communities. Competition with the GWR also diluted passenger traffic within this area, as this carried the bulk of passengers to the major urban centres of the West Country. Steam-hauled passenger services in the east of the network were gradually replaced with electric traction, especially around London&#x27;s suburbs.

Passenger services on secondary routes were given motive power that befitted the lacklustre nature of the duty, with elderly locomotives used to provide a local service that fed into the major mainline stations such as Basingstoke. The use of elderly locomotives and stock was invariably a financial consideration, intended to prolong the life of locomotives that would otherwise be scrapped. In some cases, the route was such that some of the newer classes were precluded from operating because of restrictions in loading gauge, the Lyme Regis branch from Axminster providing an example.

The Southern Railway also operated push-pull trains of up to two carriages in commuter areas. Push-pull operations did not need the time-consuming use of a turntable or run-around at the end of a suburban branch line, and enabled the driver to use a cab in the end coach to drive the locomotive in reverse. Such operations were similar to the autotrains, with a Drummond M7 providing the motive power.

=== Freight operations ===
Passenger traffic was the main source of revenue for the Southern Railway throughout its existence, although goods were also carried in separate trains. Goods such as milk and cattle from the agricultural areas of the West Country provided a regular source of freight traffic, whilst imports from the south coast ports also required carriage by rail to freight terminals such as the large Bricklayers Arms facility. The railway operated three large marshalling yards for freight on the outskirts of South London, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green, where freight could be sorted for onward travel to their final destinations. It also handled a large volume of cross-London freight from these to other yards north of the river via the West London and East London Lines which were jointly owned by the Southern Railway.

As locomotives increased in size so did the length of goods trains, from 40 to as many as 100 four-wheeled wagons, although the gradient of the line and the braking capabilities of the locomotive often limited this. The vacuum brake, which was standard equipment on passenger trains, was gradually fitted to a number of ordinary goods wagons, allowing a number of vacuum &quot;fitted&quot; trains to run faster than 40 mph (64 km/h). While typical goods wagons could carry 8, 10 or (later) 12 tons, the load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton, as the railway was designated as a common carrier that could not choose what goods it could carry.

=== Ancillary operations ===
The Southern Railway inherited a range of railway-related activities from its constituent companies, which it continued to develop until nationalisation in 1948. These activities included several ports, a fleet of ships, road services (both freight and passenger) and several hotels. These ancillary operations provided extra revenue for the railway at a time when railways were classified as a common carrier by the Railway Regulation Act 1844, and could not compete with road with regards to pricing. This was because railways were obliged to advertise their rates of carriage at railway stations, which could subsequently be undercut by road haulage companies. The Southern Railway also invested in an air service during the 1930s, which supplemented the popular sea crossings to the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands.

====Shipping====
The Southern inherited docks at Southampton, Newhaven, Plymouth, Folkestone, Dover, Littlehampton, Whitstable, Strood, Rye, Queenborough, Port Victoria and Padstow. The Southern continued to invest heavily in these facilities, and Southampton overtook Liverpool as Britain&#x27;s main port for Trans-Atlantic liners. The Southern inherited 38 large turbine or other steamers and a number of other vessels branded under Channel Packet, the maritime arm of the railway, all of which passed to British Railways control after nationalisation in 1948.

====Ships====

The Southern inherited a number of ships from its constituent companies, some of which were converted to car ferries when this mode of transport became more common. Such conversions were needed on the French routes, where holidays by car were beginning to become popular. Services to the Channel Islands began in 1924, along with services to Brittany in 1933 and finally Normandy commencing just prior to nationalisation in 1947.

====Hotels, road transport and air transport====
Ten large hotels were owned by the company, at the London termini and at the coast. The Charing Cross Hotel, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 and gave the station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. At Cannon Street station in London, an Italianate style hotel was constructed in 1867, designed by Barry. This provided much of the station&#x27;s passenger facilities as well as an impressive architectural frontispiece to the street prior to demolition in 1960. London Bridge station boasted The Terminus hotel of 1861, which was turned into offices for the LBSCR in 1892, and destroyed by bombing in 1941. Victoria station had the 300-bedroom Grosvenor hotel, which was rebuilt in 1908. Other hotels were to be found at Southampton and other port locations connected to the railway.

From 1929, the Southern Railway invested in bus companies providing feeder services to its trains. The brand names Southern National (a joint venture with the National Omnibus &amp; Transport Co. Ltd.) and Southern Vectis have long outlived the railway company they originally served.
The Southern Railway also undertook freight transfer by road, owning a fleet of goods vehicles providing a door-to-door delivery service. This was especially useful for bulky items that required delivery to areas not immediately served by a railway. Conflat-type wagons were used to carry containers by rail to a destination close to the delivery address, where they would be transferred by crane onto the trailer of a vehicle for onward travel by road.

In conjunction with other Big Four companies the Southern Railway also invested in providing air services for passengers, notably to the Channel Islands and Isle of Wight, which complemented the shipping operations. Such operations provided the chance to take revenue from non-railway passengers, and enabled fast air-freight services between the islands and the mainland. However, this operation was disrupted during the Second World War due to the occupation of the Channel Islands, and the rationing of aviation fuel.

In 1937, the Southern Railway was involved in a scheme to build a new airport at Lullingstone, Kent, holding an option to purchase the land that the airport was to be built on. Parliamentary approval was obtained to construct a short branch line from station to the airport. At their 1938 Annual General Meeting, it was stated that the opinion of the company was that the cost of building the airport meant that there would not be sufficient return to justify the expenditure. The option to purchase the land subsequently lapsed.

==Livery, traction and rolling stock==

===Livery and numbering system===
For most of its existence the Southern Railway painted its 2,390 locomotives in a rich yellow/brown olive green, with plain black frames and wheels, and fittings were lined in black with thin white edges. From 1937, the basic livery was changed by Bulleid to a matt blue/green malachite green that was similar in appearance to copper carbonate. This was complemented with black wheels and frames with bright yellow lettering and lining-out of the various locomotive fixtures. Some of Bulleid&#x27;s locomotives had their wheels painted in malachite green with yellow rims, though this combination was scarcely used. Pre-grouping and Maunsell locomotives were given yellow and black lining to complement the malachite green livery. During the Second World War, engines that went for overhaul were painted in an overall matt black due to the scarcity of paint and labour. The yellow lettering remained, highlighted with malachite green. The period leading up to nationalisation in 1948 saw a reversion to malachite green, albeit in gloss form. Below are examples of Southern Railway livery, including the approximate dates of first application:

* Gloss black (common to most freight designs at grouping, adopted by Maunsell as standard in 1923)
* LBSCR dark umber (1905–1923)
* LSWR Urie sage green (1912–1924; this became the standard passenger locomotive livery immediately after grouping)
* LSWR holly green (1912–1923; freight livery inherited from the LSWR at grouping)
* SECR grey (until 1923; inherited from the SECR at grouping)
* SR Maunsell olive green (1924–1939; introduced as the first standard passenger livery for the Southern Railway)
* Wartime matt black (1940–1950; a wartime labour-saving livery)
* SR Bulleid light green (1938–1940; first applied to N15 and H15 classes, dropped in favour of malachite green)
* SR Bulleid malachite green (1939–1950; became standard livery for all Southern passenger locomotives)

Maunsell locomotives featured name and number plates of polished brass with a red or black background in 1924. Bulleid nameplates were generally gunmetal with polished brass lettering, and featured crests depicting aspects of the class theme (Merchant Navy, West Country or Battle of Britain).

Until 1931 the Southern Railway initially maintained the locomotive numbers from its constituents, and solved the problem of more than one locomotive having the same number by letter prefixes denoting the main works of the former owning company. All ex-SECR locos were prefixed by &quot;A&quot; (for Ashford), ex-LBSCR by &quot;B&quot; (for Brighton) and ex-LSWR engines by &quot;E&quot; (for Eastleigh). Isle of Wight locomotive numbers were prefixed by &quot;W&quot; (for Wight). New locomotives were prefixed by the letter of the works where they were built. In 1931 the fleet was re-numbered by dropping all prefixes, leaving E-prefixed numbers unchanged, adding 1000 to A-prefixed numbers and 2000 to B-prefixed ones, an exception being the Z-class 0-8-0 shunters whose numbers A950-A957 only lost the prefix, with no addition. (Some non-revenue-earning locos were exempt from this scheme).

Under Bulleid, a new continental system of numbering was introduced for his own locomotives, based upon his experiences at the French branch of Westinghouse Electric before the First World War, and his tenure in the rail operating department during that conflict. The Southern Railway number adapted a modified UIC classification system where &quot;2&quot; and &quot;1&quot; refer to the number of un-powered leading and trailing axles respectively, and &quot;C&quot; refers to three driving axles (the system was only applied to new 6-coupled locos and one Co-Co electric loco before nationalisation). As an example, the first Merchant Navy class locomotive was numbered 21C1.

===Motive power===

The Southern Railway inherited in the region of 2,281 steam locomotives from its constituent companies at grouping From the major constituents, excluding the Isle of Wight and some minor railways, this was composed of:
One of Holcroft&#x27;s first tasks on joining the SR from his post with the SE&amp;CR at Ashford was to produce an overall stock list and diagram book so that the capacity and route availability of unfamiliar loco classes could be understood across the railway, allowing locos to operate outside of their former areas. He produced a grading system so that an express passenger class such as the LSWR N15 &quot;King Arthurs&quot; might be graded as P5/8/3 for Passenger, Grade, Power and Range (route availability).

The railway handed over in the region 1,789 locomotives to British Railways in 1948. Similarly, it inherited 84 DC multiple units (later designated 3-SUB) from the LSWR and 38 AC units (later designated CP and SL classes) from the LBSCR, and handed over in the region of 1480 DC units.

====Steam locomotives====
From 1924, Maunsell began standardising the fleet of locomotives for ease of maintenance. Later Bulleid undertook sweeping changes that propelled the Southern Railway into the forefront of locomotive design.
The first locomotives constructed for the Southern Railway were to designs inherited from the pre-Grouping railway companies, such as the N15 class and H15 class, though both were modified by Maunsell from the original design. These were intended as interim solutions to motive power problems, since several designs in operation on the Southern Railway were obsolete. The 1920s was the era of standardisation, with ease of maintenance and repair key considerations in a successful locomotive design.

In 1926, the first new Southern Railway-designed and -built locomotives emerged from Eastleigh works: the Maunsell Lord Nelson class, reputedly the most powerful 4-6-0 in Britain at the time. So successful was the Lord Nelson class that the Royal Scot class had its origins in the Maunsell design. However, the Depression of 1929 precluded further improvements in Southern Railway locomotive technology, apart from the V &quot;Schools&quot; class 4-4-0 and various electric designs. Maunsell also designed locomotives for use in freight yards such as that at Feltham in south west London, the final example of which was the Q class. The design of the Q class coincided with Maunsell&#x27;s ill health, resulting in a conservative approach to design. The first examples were completed in 1937, the year in which Maunsell retired from the CME&#x27;s position.

Maunsell was succeeded in 1937 by Oliver Bulleid, who brought experience gained under Sir Nigel Gresley at the LNER. He designed the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear that was compact enough to fit within the restrictions of his &quot;Pacific&quot; designs, the Merchant Navy class of 1941 and the &quot;Light Pacific&quot; design of 1945. Ever the innovator, Bulleid introduced welded steel boilers and steel fireboxes which were easier to repair than the copper variety, whilst a new emphasis on cab ergonomics was followed. Established locomotive design practices were altered in his designs, with the wheels changed from the traditional spoked to his BFB disc wheel design, giving better all-round support to the tyre.

Visually, the most distinctive of his designs was a small, heavy freight locomotive, the most powerful and last non-derivative 0-6-0 design to operate in Britain. This Q1 class eliminated anything that might be considered unnecessary in locomotive design, including the traditional wheel splashers. With innovative lagging material that dictated the shape of the boiler cladding, the Q1 was regarded by many as one of the ugliest locomotives ever constructed. The 40 engines produced required the same amount of material needed for 38 more conventional machines, justifying the economies and design.

Bulleid&#x27;s innovation stemmed from a belief in the continued development of steam traction, and culminated in the Leader class of 1946, an 0-6-6-0 design that had two cabs, negating the use of a turntable. The entire locomotive was placed on two bogies, enabling negotiation around tight curves, while the slab-sided body could be cleaned by a labour-saving carriage washer.

Despite the successes of the &quot;Pacifics&quot; and the unconventional Q1 freight locomotives, the &quot;Pacifics&quot; were difficult to maintain and featured enough eccentricities to justify rebuilding in the mid-1950s. The innovations ensured that the Southern was once again leading the field in locomotive design, and earned Bulleid the title &quot;last giant of steam&quot; in Britain.

====Diesel locomotives====
Maunsell began experimenting with the use of diesel locomotives for yard shunting in 1937. He ordered three locomotives, which proved to be successful, but his retirement and the onset of the Second World War prevented further development. Bulleid adapted and improved the design but his class did not appear until 1949, after nationalisation. Bulleid also designed a class of main line diesel-electric locomotives, continuing to push back the boundaries of contemporary locomotive design and established practice, but this was built by British Railways.

====Electric locomotives====
The Southern Railway also built two mixed-traffic electric locomotives, numbered CC1 and CC2 under Bulleid&#x27;s numbering system. They were designed by Bulleid and Alfred Raworth, and were renumbered 20001 and 20002 after nationalisation. At this time a third locomotive was under construction, and was numbered 20003 in 1948. The locomotives were later classified as British Rail Class 70. These incorporated a cab design similar to that of the 2HAL (2-car &quot;Ha&quot;lf &quot;L&quot;avatory electric stock) design constructed from 1938. This was due to ease of construction by welding, which allowed both cheap and speedy construction. With the outbreak of war in 1939, most new locomotive construction projects were put on hold in favour of the war effort, although construction of CC1 and CC2 was exempted from this because of promised savings in labour and fuel over steam locomotives.

====Electric Multiple Units (EMUs)====

The early LBSCR AC overhead Electric multiple units (EMU) were phased-out by September 1929 and converted into DC types. All further electrification was at 660 V DC, and investment was made in modernising the fleet inherited from the pre-Grouping companies, and building new stock often by converting existing steam hauled carriages. The Southern Railway&#x27;s EMU classification meant the unit type was given a three-letter code (sometimes two letters), prefixed by the number of carriages within each unit. These early suburban units, constructed between 1925 and 1937 were therefore designated 3-SUB, or later 4-SUB, depending on the number of coaches. The EMUs consisted of a fixed formation of two driving units at both ends of the train, and could have varying numbers of carriages in between (as indicated in the classification).

Newly built units of 4-LAV 6PUL and 5BEL (Brighton Belle) types were introduced in 1932 for the electrification of the Brighton Main Line. Further types were introduced as electrification spread further. Thus the 2-BIL units were constructed between 1935 and 1938 to work long-distance semi-fast services to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading, or the 2-HAL for those to Maidstone and Gillingham. 4-COR units, handled fast trains on the London Waterloo railway station to Portsmouth Harbour railway station from April 1937.

A total of 460 electric vehicles were to be built by the Southern Railway before nationalisation. Variants of the Southern Railway&#x27;s electric stock included Pullman carriages or wagons for the carriage of parcels and newspapers, allowing flexibility of use on the London suburban lines and the Eastern Section of the network.

====Other forms of traction====
The railway also experimented with other forms of traction. It bought a 50 hp petrol-driven Drewry Railcar in 1927 to test its operating cost and reliability on lightly used branch lines. It was not successful and was sold to the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Railway in 1934. Similarly, a Sentinel steam railcar was purchased in 1933 for use on the Devil&#x27;s Dyke branch. It was transferred from that line in March 1936 and tried in other areas, but was withdrawn in 1940.

===Carriages===

The Southern inherited many wooden-bodied carriage designs from its constituent companies. However, there was an emphasis on standardising the coaching stock, which led to Maunsell designing new carriages. These were classified between 0 and 4, so that an -wide carriage was &quot;Restriction 0&quot;. The restrictions related to the Southern&#x27;s composite loading gauge, so that some more restricted routes could be catered for. The new carriages were based upon the former LSWR &quot;Ironclad&quot; carriage designs, and comprised First and Third Class compartments, each of which contained a corridor and doors for each compartment, enabling quick egress on commuter services. Similar principles were applied to the electric train sets, where quick passenger egress promoted a punctual service.

The Southern Railway was one of the few railways to marshal its carriages into fixed numbered sets. This made maintenance easier, as the location of a particular set would always be known through its number, which was painted on the ends of the set. A pool of &quot;loose&quot; carriages was kept for train strengthening on summer Saturdays and to replace faulty stock.

The second phase of carriage construction began towards the end of the Southern Railway&#x27;s existence. Bulleid had vast experience in carriage design from his time with the LNER, and he applied this acquired knowledge to a new fleet of well-regarded carriages (see picture). One of his more unusual projects was his &quot;Tavern Car&quot; design, carriages that were to represent a typical country tavern, with a bar and seating space provided within the carriage. The outside of the &quot;Tavern Cars&quot; were partially painted in a mock-Tudor style of architecture, and were given typical public house names. Poor ventilation from small windows made the &quot;Tavern Cars&quot; unpopular amongst the travelling public, with several being converted to ordinary use during the 1950s.

The Southern Railway was the only one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; British railway companies that did not operate sleeping cars other than those brought in from the continent on the &#x27;Night Ferry&#x27;. This was because the short distances meant that such provision was not financially viable. The Southern Railway also undertook the practice of converting inherited carriages into electric stock, a cheaper alternative to constructing brand new EMUs. Bulleid initiated an unusual project that attempted to address the problem of overcrowding on suburban services. The answer to the problem was Britain&#x27;s first double-deck carriages, which were eventually built in 1949. Two units, each of four cars, were completed and saw use until the 1970s. However, further orders for these trains were not placed due to cramped conditions inside which were dictated by the restrictions of the loading gauge.

===Wagons===
The Southern Railway painted its freight wagons dark brown. Most wagons were four-wheeled with the letters &quot;SR&quot; in white, and there were also some six-wheeled milk tankers on the South West Main Line which supplied United Dairies in London. As the railway was primarily passenger-orientated, there was little investment in freight wagons except for general utility vans, which could be used for both freight and luggage. These consisted of bogie and four-wheel designs, and were frequently used on boat trains. At its peak the Southern Railway owned 37,500 freight wagons; in contrast, the Railway Executive Committee controlled 500,000 privately owned colliery wagons during the Second World War.

== Cultural impact ==
The Southern Railway was particularly successful at promoting itself to the public. The downgrading of the Mid-Sussex line via Horsham that served Portsmouth was met with hostility by the general public, causing a public relations disaster. This stimulated the creation of the first &quot;modern&quot; public relations department with the appointment of John Elliot (later Sir John Elliot) in 1925. Elliot was instrumental in creating the positive image that the Southern enjoyed prior to the Second World War, building a publicity campaign for its electrification project that marketed the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Suburban Electric&quot;.

=== Tourism ===
The positive image of progress was enhanced by the promotion of the south and south-west as holiday destinations. &quot;Sunny South Sam&quot; became a character that embodied the railway, whilst slogans such as &quot;Live in Kent and be content&quot; encouraged commuters to move out from London and patronise the Southern Railway&#x27;s services. Posters also advertised ocean services from Ocean Terminal in Southampton and the docks at Dover. These also incorporated the corresponding rail connections with London, such as &quot;The Cunarder&quot; and the &quot;Golden Arrow&quot;.

=== Heritage ===

The Southern Railway&#x27;s memory lives on at several preserved railways in the south of England, including the Watercress Line, the Swanage Railway, the Spa Valley Railway, the Bluebell Railway, the Isle of Wight Steam Railway and the Dartmoor Railway. Other remnants of the railway include Eastleigh works and the London termini, including Waterloo (the largest London railway station), Victoria, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and London Bridge (the oldest London terminus). Several societies promote continued interest in the SR, such as the Southern Railways Group and the Southern Electric Group.

== Notable people ==

===Chairmen of the board of directors===
*Sir Hugh Drummond (1923–1 August 1924). Drummond had been chairman of the London and South Western Railway since 1911. He died in office.
*The Honourable Everard Baring (1924–7 May 1932). Died in office. 
*Gerald Loder (1932–December 1934). Became Lord Wakehurst in June 1934, and resigned at the end of the year.

*Colonel Eric Gore-Brown (February 1944–nationalisation).

===General managers===

Sir Herbert Ashcombe Walker, KCB, (1923–1937). Walker was an astute administrator of railways, having gained experience as General Manager of the LSWR from 1912. After retiring in 1937 he was a director of the Southern until the end of its existence in 1947. Two significant events occurred under Walker&#x27;s tenure as General Manager: electrification in the mid-1920s and the appointment of Bulleid as CME in 1937.

Gilbert S. Szlumper, TD, CBE, (1937–1939). Trained as a civil engineer and became Docks and Marine Manager at Southampton, before becoming Assistant General Manager in 1925. In 1939 the War Office recalled him as a Major-General to sort out the military movements at Southampton Docks. He was ousted from the General Managership after the Traffic Manager, Eustace Missenden, refused to become Acting General Manager, and threatened to resign if not confirmed as GM proper.

Sir Eustace Missenden(1939–Nationalisation); chairman, Railway Executive (1947–1951). Missenden was traffic manager before becoming General Manager 1939. From the latter half of 1947, he was largely absent from the Southern Railway as Chairman of the Railway Executive.

Sir John Elliot Acting General Manager (1947); Assistant General Manager (1933 to nationalisation); Public Relations Assistant (1925–1933). Noted for being Britain&#x27;s first expert in public relations, Elliot was brought in by Sir Herbert Walker after bad press was received following service delays and consolidation of the newly created company. Elliot suggested that the Southern&#x27;s express passenger locomotives should be named, representing positive publicity for the railway, while distinctive locomotive liveries and well-known posters were created under his direction. He continued to serve the railways after nationalisation in 1948, and became Chairman of London Transport in 1953.

===Chief mechanical engineers===
R. E. L. Maunsell, the Southern&#x27;s first chief mechanical engineer (1922 to 1937). Maunsell was responsible for initial attempts at locomotive standardisation on the Southern, as well as overseeing the introduction of electric traction. Among his many achievements was the introduction of the 4-6-0 SR Lord Nelson Class locomotives and also the SR Class V or &quot;Schools&quot; class, which were the ultimate and very successful development of the British 4-4-0 express passenger type. He also introduced new, standardised rolling stock designs for use on the Southern network, which were based upon the railway&#x27;s composite loading gauge.

O. V. S. Bulleid, CBE (CME 1937 to nationalisation). Bulleid moved to the Southern from the LNER, bringing several ideas for improving the efficiency of steam locomotives. Such innovations were used on the Merchant Navy class, West Country and Battle of Britain classes (&quot;Bulleid Light Pacifics&quot;), Q1 and experimental Leader designs. He also developed innovative electric units and locomotives.

===Other engineers===
Alfred Raworth (1882–1967) was chief electrical engineer to the Southern Railway from 1938 until 1946. He had joined the London and South Western Railway in 1912. After retirement he became a consulting engineer to the English Electric Company.

Alfred Szlumper (1858–1934) was Chief Engineer to the Southern Railway from 1924 to 1927, when he retired. He was the father of Gilbert Szlumper who was later the General Manager of the Southern Railway.

<doc id="428217" wikidata="Q3364073" url="?curid=428217" title="McArthur–Burney Falls Memorial State Park">
<text>McArthur–Burney Falls Memorial State Park is the second oldest state park in the California State Parks system, located approximately north of Burney, California. The park offers camping, fishing, watersports, hiking and horseback riding facilities. The park is mainly known for the waterfall, Burney Falls, at the entrance of the park. Wildlife in the park includes bass, trout, Steller&#x27;s jay, squirrels, woodpeckers, deer, and on rare occasion, black bear.

==Geology==

The park is within the Cascade Range and Modoc Plateau natural region, with of forest and of streamside and lake shoreline, including a portion of Lake Britton.

The park&#x27;s centerpiece is the Burney Falls. Burney Creek originates from the park&#x27;s underground springs, with additional water coming from springs, which join the creek to create a mist-filled basin. Below the falls, the creek flows into Lake Britton.

The park&#x27;s landscape was created by volcanic activity as well as erosion from weather and streams. This volcanic region is surrounded by mountain peaks and is covered by black volcanic rock, or basalt. Created over a million years ago, the layered, porous basalt retains rainwater and snow melt, which forms a large underground reservoir.

Within the park, the water emerges as springs at and above Burney Falls, where it flows at 100 million gallons every day (4.4 m3/s).

==History==

Burney Falls was named after pioneer settler Samuel Burney who lived in the area in the 1850s. The McArthur Family were pioneer settlers who arrived in the late 19th century. Descendants were responsible for saving the waterfall and nearby land from development, purchasing the property and presenting it as a gift to the state in the 1920s.

== Burney Creek ==
Burney Creek is a tributary of the Pit River, with its mouth on Lake Britton reservoir to the north. The creek is the only area within the park where fishing is allowed.

It is possible to go upstream ten yards of the falls, where the view is so obstructed by natural elements that it&#x27;s difficult to discern one is close to the cascade.

==Recreation==

=== Hiking ===

There are of hiking trails winding through the park&#x27;s evergreen forests. The Pacific Crest Trail passes through the park, and the park store can be used as a general delivery mailing address for hikers. There is also a hike to the Pioneer&#x27;s Cemetery, (the longest hike in the park at around .) There are three main trails leading from the falls; The Falls Loop Trail, Burney Creek Trail, and the Headwaters Loop Trail – all of which start near the visitor center.

The primary trail is the Falls Loop Trail () that begins at the Burney Falls overlook. From there, it descends to the bottom of the falls, proceeds downstream to the Rainbow Footbridge. From there, it crosses Burney Creek and ascends back on the other side of the ravine (providing alternate views of the falls), and finally returning across the creek again via Fisherman’s Bridge.

The first alternate trail is the Burney Creek Trail (). It leads downstream from the Falls Loop Trail, at Rainbow Bridge, to Lake Britton and the swimming/boating area. It travels through some magnificent mixed coniferous forest and patches white diatomaceous earth. The second alternate is the Headwaters Trail ( loop) that loops upstream from the Fisherman’s Bridge parking lot to the headwaters spring (feeding Burney Falls). The loop returns crossing the Pacific Crest Trail Footbridge, back downstream, and finally crossing Fisherman’s Bridge back to Fisherman’s parking lot.

=== Lake Britton ===

Also, a portion of Lake Britton (owned by PG&amp;E) is accessible to all park visitors for swimming, boating, water sports, and a small portion is reserved for fishing. The water flowing into Lake Britton from Burney Creek stays at approximately ). The people who go boating are able to enjoy the long lake and are able to explore numerous nooks and crannies well beyond the boundaries of McArthur–Burney Falls Memorial State Park. These include a rail bridge that was used in the 1986 movie &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, the Pit River Dam, many independent boat docks, and a villa owned by the PG&amp;E employee association. Canoes, kayaks, paddle boats, or motorized patio boats are available to rent.

==Notable Facts==

*The railroad bridge scene from the 1986 film &quot;Stand By Me&quot; was filmed just outside the park on a bridge owned by the McCloud River Railroad over Lake Britton.
*Half of Burney Falls was seen in the 1988 George Lucas/Ron Howard movie &quot;Willow&quot;. The other half was digitally removed from the shots.
*The falls were called &quot;the Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; by President Theodore Roosevelt.
*The falls (behind them) is one of the few known nesting sites for the black swift
*Burney Falls were declared a National Natural Landmark in December 1984.

<doc id="428219" wikidata="Q126448" url="?curid=428219" title="Q (New York City Subway service)">
<text>The Q Second Avenue/Broadway Express/Brighton Local is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it is a part of the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan.

The Q operates 24 hours a day between 96th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and Stillwell Avenue in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Daytime service makes express stops in Manhattan (between 57th Street–Seventh Avenue and Canal Street) and all stops in Brooklyn; overnight service makes all stops along the full route.

The Q was originally the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)&#x27;s 1 service; beginning in 1920, it ran along the Brighton Line in Brooklyn and Broadway Line in Manhattan. In the past, the Q has run many different service patterns in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, both local and express, including QB service on the Manhattan Bridge and QT service via the Montague Street Tunnel. From 1988 to 2001, Q service ran along the IND Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan, with a bullet colored orange. The Q also ran in Queens at various points, including along the BMT Astoria Line to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard on weekdays from 2010 to 2016, along the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills–71st Avenue during temporary post-9/11 service reroutes, and along the IND 63rd Street Line to 21st Street–Queensbridge until 2001. There was also a &lt;Q&gt; variant from 2001 to 2004, which ran express on the Brighton Line and terminated at Brighton Beach due to construction on the north side of the Manhattan Bridge. On January 1, 2017, the Q was rerouted along the Second Avenue Subway.

==History==
===1878–1920: Original railroad===
The predecessor to the subway service known as the Q today was the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway. On July 2, 1878, this steam railroad began operations on what would become the BMT Brighton Line, from Prospect Park to the Brighton Beach Hotel in Brighton Beach, which opened at the same time. The Brighton Beach Hotel was located on Coney Island by the Atlantic Ocean at the foot of modern-day Coney Island Avenue. Passengers could make connections with the horsecars of the Brooklyn City Railroad at the Prospect Park terminal.

On August 19, 1878, service was extended north from Prospect Park along what is today the BMT Franklin Avenue Line used by the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, to Atlantic Avenue west of Franklin Avenue, a location known as Bedford station on what is today the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). A physical connection existed between the Brighton, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway and the LIRR. By mutual agreement trains of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway ran on LIRR trackage west to its terminal at Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, providing a connection to Downtown Brooklyn and ferries to Manhattan. LIRR trains also operated to Brighton Beach from Flatbush Avenue and from its own terminal in Long Island City, with ferry access to Midtown Manhattan. Initially, service operated during the summer season only. At the end of the 1882 summer season, the LIRR abrogated its agreement allowing Brighton Line trains to access its Flatbush Avenue terminal and beginning with the 1883 summer season, only Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island trains operated between Bedford Terminal and Brighton Beach.

In 1896, a short elevated extension of the Brighton Beach Line (since reorganized as the Brooklyn &amp; Brighton Beach Railroad) opened to the corner of Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street in the north. This extension connected to the Fulton Street Line of the Kings County Elevated Railroad, allowing rapid transit trains on Fulton Street to operate along the Brighton Line. These trains ran from Brighton Beach, up the Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street lines to the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge, where walking or transferring to a cable car service connection over the bridge allowed access to New York City Hall at Park Row in Manhattan. In 1900, elevated trains were through-routed to Park Row without need to change trains. By 1903, a surface extension of the Brighton Beach Line on what is now Brighton Beach Avenue permitted through service from Park Row, Manhattan west to Culver Depot at Surf Avenue near West 8th Street, much nearer to the growing amusement center known then as West Brighton and now as Coney Island.

In 1908, a massive grade crossing elimination project was completed with a 4-track line from south of Church Avenue station to Neptune Avenue near the Coney Island Creek, permitting true local and express service, as pioneered on the New York City Subway that opened in 1904. The Brighton Beach line was also converted to electrified third rail. Brighton Beach local and express service was extended to a new West End terminal at Stillwell and Surf Avenues, the location of the Coney Island terminal for the BMT Southern Division, in May 1919.

===1920–1950: Subway service begins===

On August 1, 1920, subway service on the BMT Brighton Line, then owned by the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), officially began with the openings of a two-track underground subway between Prospect Park and DeKalb Avenue and the Montague Street Tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan.

In 1921, PM rush hour express service was extended from Kings Highway to Brighton Beach. In 1923, Brighton express service operated via the Montague Tunnel and ran local on the Broadway Line. The BMT held a vote to see which route riders preferred on August 30, 1923. Passengers voted to have Brighton expresses run from Brighton Beach to Times Square via the Manhattan Bridge and the express tracks on the Broadway Line. This change took effect on about October 1, 1923. This subway service was labeled 1 by the BMT starting in 1924, with the remnant service to Franklin Avenue becoming the 7. 1 Brighton Express service operated during rush hours and Saturday afternoons. During the evening rush hour and on Saturday afternoons, trains skipped Canal Street.

The span of express service was extended by 90 minutes until 8:27 p.m. leaving Times Square in 1929. Express service began operating between the AM rush hour and noon on Saturday mornings in April 1930. Express service began operating middays on May 30, 1931, replacing short-line local service. In September 1937, Brighton express service ran between Brighton Beach and Times Square rush hours, middays, and early evenings weekdays and Saturdays.

During the 1930s, limited morning rush hour service ran via the south side tracks of the Manhattan Bridge and the Nassau Street Loop to Chambers Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line. On June 29, 1950, trains began running there during the evening rush as well.

On October 17, 1949, the IRT Astoria Line in Queens, up to this point operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT), was converted to BMT operation. 1 Local trains were extended via the 60th Street Tunnel and the BMT Astoria Line to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard during weekday rush hours, and on Saturday mornings and early afternoons. Number 2 Fourth Avenue Local trains also ran here at all times.

===1950s===
On April 27, 1950, 1 Local trains were extended to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard during middays. On June 26, 1952, 1 Express trains were extended from Times Square to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue on weekdays after the morning rush hour, running local north of 34th Street. On June 28, 1952, special service from Brighton Beach to the Nassau Street Line was discontinued on Saturdays, and Saturday express service was extended to 57th Street.

The 60th Street Tunnel Connection opened on December 1, 1955, connecting the Broadway Line to the IND Queens Boulevard Line. 1 Local trains were rerouted to this new connector to Forest Hills–71st Avenue in Forest Hills, Queens between 6:30 a.m. and 8:20 p.m. They were replaced on the BMT Astoria Line by 1 Express trains on weekdays. On May 4, 1957, 1 Express trains running started running to Ditmars Boulevard on Saturdays as well, but made local stops in Manhattan as the local trains in Brooklyn now ran to Chambers Street via the BMT Nassau Street Line. The final portion of the Broadway Line&#x27;s express tracks, between Times Square–42nd Street and 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, was placed in service on May 2, 1957. 1 Brighton Express trains ran local in Manhattan on Saturdays while Brighton Locals ran express here during evenings and on Sundays. This lasted only until the next service change. On October 24, 1957, Brighton Local trains ran via the Manhattan Bridge and local in Manhattan, all day on Sundays as well as evenings and midnight hours. Brighton Express 1 service on weekdays began using the express tracks between Times Square–42nd Street and 57th Street–Seventh Avenue.

A December 1957 strike shut down much of the BMT Division. Brighton Local 1 trains ran in two sections, from Coney Island via tunnel to 57th Street-Seventh Avenue and from Whitehall Street to Jamaica–179th Street on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Due to the differing unions predominating on the various divisions, the IND was completely knocked out of service, while the IRT ran virtually normal service. The BMT was about half affected, with makeshift service patterns being set up for the duration of the strike.

On May 28, 1959, 1 Brighton Express trains midday on weekdays were cut back to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue and made local stops in Brooklyn midday. Multiple trains entered service at Queensboro Plaza in the evening rush hour. Nassau Specials returned, running via the Montague Street tunnel during the morning rush and via the Manhattan Bridge during the evening rush. As part of the same service change, Brighton Local trains, beginning on June 6, ran to Franklin Avenue via the route of the 7 Shuttle on Saturdays. This was not seasonal and ran the entire day, being quite distinct from the Sunday service which still operated.

===1960–1987: Lettered variants and Chrystie Street Connection===
R27/R32 rollsigns for the Q, QB and QT

On November 15, 1960, with the arrival of the R27 subway cars, 1 service on the Brighton Line was relabeled. Brighton Express service was designated as Q, Brighton Local via the Montague St Tunnel as QT, and Brighton Local via the Manhattan Bridge as QB. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the Independent Subway System (IND), however, no QQ designation was ever used. Despite these new designations, subway communications continued to refer to the services as &quot;Brighton Local&quot; and &quot;Brighton Express&quot;.

Effective January 1, 1961, Q Brighton Express service was cut back from Ditmars Boulevard to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue on weekdays, with trains skipping 49th Street. Saturday daytime service continued to run to Ditmars Boulevard. QT service ran to Ditmars Boulevard on weekdays; on Saturdays, it ran via the Franklin Avenue Line to Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn instead. The QB provided off-peak service between Coney Island and Astoria, via Brighton Local and the Manhattan Bridge. Sunday service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach was discontinued on this date, with Sunday service now provided solely by the Franklin Avenue Shuttle (SS, formerly 7) between Prospect Park and Fulton Street.

Service between Brighton Beach and Franklin Avenue was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and all non-shuttle service between was discontinued in February 1963. The Fourth Avenue Local (RR) now provided Broadway Line service along the Queens Boulevard line on weekdays, and the West End Express (T) was extended from 57th Street to Ditmars Boulevard during rush hours. This service change essentially swapped the northern terminals of the Brighton Local and RR, and between the Brighton Express and T. Prior to this both Brighton Line–Broadway services had operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. By having the Brighton Express Q terminate at 57th Street, this change served to keep one Brighton Line service unaffected in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.

On April 21, 1962, Saturday express Q service was discontinued, and replaced by QB service. All Saturday trains on the Brighton Line began running local, doubling the frequency of service and providing a one-seat ride to Manhattan for riders at local stations. With the arrival of new subway cars to the line, which provided improved running times, trains making local stops between Brighton Beach and Prospect Park did so in only minutes longer than existing express service.

From February 10 to November 2, 1964, the Brighton Express tracks were closed to permit platform extension work at Newkirk Avenue. Skip-stop service was instituted along the Brighton Line. Brighton Express service, which made A stops, ran express from Brighton Beach to Kings Highway, and then stopped at Avenue J, Newkirk Avenue, Cortelyou Road, Beverley Road, Church Avenue, Parkside Avenue, and Prospect Park.

On November 26, 1967, the Chrystie Street Connection opened, connecting the Brighton Line in Brooklyn to the IND Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan via the Manhattan Bridge. The bridge&#x27;s south side tracks, which formerly connected to the BMT Nassau Street Line, were now connected to the Broadway Line express tracks instead. The bridge&#x27;s north side tracks, which formerly connected to the Broadway Line, now connected to the Sixth Avenue Line express tracks. Originally, the running via Sixth Avenue Express, and the running via Nassau Street and the Montague Street Tunnel, were to replace all three Q services on the Brighton Line. The Q and QT went out of existence completely, but due to riders&#x27; opposition to the expected loss of all Broadway Line service, some QB trains were retained, now running rush hours only in the peak direction between Coney Island and 57th Street via Brighton Local, the Manhattan Bridge, and Broadway Express in Manhattan. The color scheme introduced for subway lines that day included a red QB bullet. A short-lived NX service also provided rush-hour service between Brighton Beach and Coney Island and the Broadway Line, running via the BMT Sea Beach Line to Manhattan. This service was discontinued on April 15, 1968, after less than five months. The RR replaced Q, QB and QT service to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard.

On August 19, 1968, one AM rush hour QB train began running to Ditmars Boulevard. From January 2, 1973, no QB trains ran in service to Ditmars Boulevard, though two trains ran light to Ditmars Boulevard from 57th Street in the AM rush, and one train ran light to 57th Street in the PM rush. On January 19, 1976, morning rush hour QB trains began running in service to Ditmars Boulevard, and most evening rush hour trains entered service at Queensboro Plaza, with only one evening rush hour train running from Coney Island to 57th Street. All but the first QB morning QB trip, which entered RR service, were cut back from Ditmars Boulevard to 57th Street on August 30, 1976. Evening rush hour trains only ran in service between Coney Island and 57th Street. The last PM rush hour QB train started at Ditmars Boulevard, having previously made a trip in RR service. The first two morning rush hour QB trains ran to Ditmars Boulevard as of May 7, 1978, returning in service as RR trains to 36th Street. The last two evening rush hour QB trains entered service at Ditmars Boulevard, with the final trip having previously made an RR trip from 36th Street.
In 1979, the MTA released a revised coloring scheme for subway routes based on trunk line; the QB service was assigned the color sunflower yellow, with black text, because it used the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan. It now used a diamond-shaped bullet because it ran rush hours only. On May 5, 1985, the double-letter naming scheme for local services was dropped; the QB was renamed the Q the next day.

Starting on April 26, 1986, the Brighton Line&#x27;s local tracks underwent reconstruction between Prospect Park and Newkirk Avenue, requiring the suspension of express service; at the same time, reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge started, which would disrupt subway service until 2004. QB service was discontinued. From April 28, 1986 to May 23, 1987, one AM rush hour train from Brighton Beach was extended beyond its normal terminal at 57th Street/Seventh Avenue and terminated at Forest Hills – 71st Avenue.

The bridge&#x27;s north side tracks (leading to the Sixth Avenue Line) closed. The Q now ran rush hours between 57th Street–Seventh Avenue and Brighton Beach, using a yellow diamond bullet. Because the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s north side tracks closed, the D and Q ran on the bridge&#x27;s south side tracks, both running via Broadway Express to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue. To substitute for the suspended Brighton Line express service, the Q ran skip-stop service with the D between Newkirk Avenue and Sheepshead Bay. D trains served Neck Road, Avenue M and Avenue H; the Q skipped those stops, serving Avenue U and Avenue J, while both lines served Kings Highway. By 1987, as reconstruction on the Brighton Line progressed, the weekday skip-stop pattern expanded to Prospect Park, with D trains serving Beverley Road while Q trains served Cortelyou Road and Parkside Avenue, with Church Avenue as a mutual station.

=== 1988–2004: Manhattan Bridge reconstruction ===


==== 1988–2001: Sixth Avenue service ====

On December 11, 1988, the Bridge&#x27;s north side tracks reopened and the south side tracks closed, and the reconstruction project on the Brighton Line ended. The Q became the weekday Brighton Express to Brighton Beach and was rerouted via the north side of the bridge and the IND Sixth Avenue Line to 57th Street–Sixth Avenue, Midtown Manhattan. Because it ran on the Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan, the route now used an orange bullet on maps. One AM rush hour train from Brighton Beach terminated at 168th Street in Manhattan instead of 21st Street; this trip last ran on September 28, 1990.

On October 29, 1989, the IND 63rd Street Line opened and the B, Q, and JFK Express were extended to 21st Street–Queensbridge in Long Island City. Weekday evening service terminated at Broadway–Lafayette Street in Manhattan instead of Brooklyn; these trains relayed at Second Avenue in order to change direction. A special combined –Q service ran during late nights; in the northbound direction, F trains would operate along its normal route from Coney Island to 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center, then turn into a Q and operate to 21st Street–Queensbridge; in the southbound direction, Q trains would operate from 21st Street to 47th–50th Streets, then turn into an F train and operate along its normal route to Coney Island. The weekday evening shuttle was replaced by the B on September 30, 1990. The replaced the late night shuttle in April 1993.

In January 1991, a reduction of service along the Central Park West corridor to remove excess capacity was proposed. Initially, Q service would operate between 207th Street and Brighton Beach during weekday rush hours and middays, making express stops along its entire route. The service plan was later amended to eliminate the Q designation and replace it with an orange A, assuming the same service pattern that was proposed for the Q. This service change would have been implemented in October 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

On February 6, 1995, Q trains began running local south of Kings Highway due to rehabilitation work on the Brighton Line. On April 30, 1995, the north side of the Manhattan Bridge closed during middays and weekends, in addition to the already-closed south side. During these hours, D service was cut below 34th Street–Herald Square. In its place, the Q ran between Coney Island and 21st Street–Queensbridge, via Brighton Local, the Montague Street Tunnel, Broadway Express (switching between the local and express tracks at Canal Street) and the BMT 63rd Street Line. Rush hour and evening service was unchanged. On May 1, Q expresses only operated during rush hours and early evening. Normal service resumed on November 12, 1995, including the restoration of Q express service between Kings Highway and Brighton Beach.

On February 22, 1998, construction on the IND 63rd Street Line cut and Q service back to 57th Street–Sixth Avenue. Service on the 63rd Street Line was replaced by a shuttle to the BMT Broadway Line at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue. Normal service resumed on May 22, 1999.

==== 2001–2004: Brighton express variant ====


On July 22, 2001, the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s north side tracks closed and the south side tracks reopened. There were now two Q services, colored yellow as they now ran via Broadway. In Brooklyn, the circle Q (Q local) replaced the as the full-time Brighton Local to Stillwell Avenue while the &lt;Q&gt; (Q express or Q diamond) replaced the Sixth Avenue Q as the weekday-only Brighton Express to Brighton Beach. Both Qs used the south side of the Manhattan Bridge to travel into Manhattan and then ran to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue via Broadway Express. Service on the IND 63rd Street Line was replaced by a shuttle, which would be permanently replaced by the in December 2001 once the 63rd Street&#x27;s connection to the IND Queens Boulevard Line opened.

After the September 11 attacks, Broadway Line service through Lower Manhattan, and service were suspended. The Q local replaced the R between Canal Street and Forest Hills–71st Avenue, making local stops in Manhattan and Queens at all times except late nights, when it terminated at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue. This was the predecessor to the Astoria extension (see below). Both services returned to normal on October 28, 2001. On September 8, 2002, Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue (the Q southern terminal) was closed for reconstruction and the Q local terminated at Brighton Beach. During this time, service at stations between Brighton Beach and Stillwell Avenue was replaced by an extension of the B68 bus. Q service to Stillwell Avenue resumed on May 23, 2004.

From April 27 to November 2, 2003, the south side of the Manhattan Bridge was closed on weekends and Q service was rerouted via the Montague Street Tunnel.

On February 22, 2004, reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge was completed and the north side tracks reopened. The &lt;Q&gt; express was discontinued and replaced with the in Brooklyn and in Manhattan to combine two weekday-only lines. The Q local remained unchanged.

===2005–present: Extensions to Astoria and Second Avenue===
On June 28, 2010, the Q was extended from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard via the 60th Street Tunnel and BMT Astoria Line on weekdays, stopping at 49th Street. The extended Q replaced the , which was discontinued due to budget shortfalls.

On December 7, 2014, late night Q service began operating local in Manhattan between 57th Street and Canal Street in order to decrease waiting time at the local stations.

On November 7, 2016, weekday Q service was cut back from Astoria to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, skipping 49th Street, to provide a seamless transition for the opening of the Second Avenue Subway. Service to Astoria and the 49th Street station was replaced by the restored W service.

On January 1, 2017, the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway opened; the Q was extended from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue to 96th Street via the BMT 63rd Street Line and the IND Second Avenue Line. This extension serves Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station with a cross-platform transfer to the IND 63rd Street Line (served by the ) before serving new stations under Second Avenue at 72nd Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street, where it originates/terminates. The inaugural train on the Second Avenue Line ran on December 31, 2016, with passenger service beginning the next day. From January 1 to 9, 2017, service between 57th Street and 96th Street ran only from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., with late-night service terminating at 57th Street; late night service to 96th Street began on January 9.

Effective June 30, 2024, one evening PM train started terminating at Brighton Beach.

===Future===
The second phase of the Second Avenue Line will extend the Q to a new northern terminal at Harlem–125th Street, with planned stops at 116th Street and 106th Street. At the Harlem–125th Street terminus, there will be a transfer to the existing 125th Street station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and a connection to Harlem–125th Street station on Metro-North Railroad. This will provide residents of East Harlem with direct subway service to the Upper East Side, western Midtown, Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and offer connections to and Metro-North from the Bronx, the northern suburbs of New York City, and southern Connecticut. An extension of the Second Avenue Line further west under 125th Street has been proposed, with transfers to other routes, although this extension has not been funded or approved.

<doc id="428226" wikidata="Q3511267" url="?curid=428226" title="Hitting streak">
<text>In baseball, a hitting streak is the number of consecutive official games in which a player appears and gets at least one base hit. According to the Official Baseball Rules, such a streak is not necessarily ended when a player has at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated if all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch, defensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate if the player has a sacrifice fly and no hit.

Joe DiMaggio holds the Major League Baseball record with a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941 which began on May 15 and ended July 17. DiMaggio hit .408 during his streak (91-for-223), with 15 home runs and 55 runs batted in. 

Ketel Marte of the Arizona Diamondbacks holds the Major League Baseball postseason record with a streak of 20 consecutive games, with the streak beginning in his first playoff game appearance. The streak began in 2017 on October 14 and was broken up in Game 5 of the 2023 World Series on November 1st, striking out as the final batter for Arizona as the Texas Rangers won the series. Marte hit .352 during his streak (31-for-88), with 3 home runs and 13 runs batted in.

==Major League Baseball==
===Regular season leaders===

There have been 55 occurrences in Major League Baseball where a player had a hitting streak of at least 30 games. Multiple streaks in the same season have occurred in 1922 (George Sisler and Rogers Hornsby), 1987 (Paul Molitor and Benito Santiago), 1997 (Nomar Garciaparra and Sandy Alomar Jr.), 1999 (Vladimir Guerrero and Luis Gonzalez), 2006 (Chase Utley and Willy Taveras), and 2011 (Andre Ethier and Dan Uggla). In addition, 1924 included one whole streak (Sam Rice) and the beginning of another (George Sisler). A similar event occurred in 2006 with two whole streaks (Utley and Taveras) and the end of another (Jimmy Rollins).

Keeler&#x27;s streak started in his final game of the 1896 season, and continued through the first 44 games of the 1897 season. Rollins ended the 2005 season with a 36-game streak and extended it through the first two games of the 2006 season. Sisler had a hit in the last game of 1924 and the first 34 games of 1925. Major League Baseball recognizes two hitting streak records: Longest hitting streak in one season, and longest hitting streak over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005–2006). Keeler&#x27;s, Sisler&#x27;s, and Rollins&#x27; streaks are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games when discussing &quot;single-season&quot; streaks, and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing &quot;multiple-season&quot; streaks.

This list omits Denny Lyons of the 1887 American Association Philadelphia Athletics, who had a 52-game hitting streak. In 1887, the major leagues adopted a new rule which counted walks as hits, a rule which was dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive games that season, but his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which his only &quot;hits&quot; were walks. In 1968, MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would not be counted as hits, so Lyons&#x27; streak was no longer recognized, though it still appears on some lists. In 2000 Major League Baseball reversed its 1968 decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year&#x27;s official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the ruling affects only hit &quot;totals&quot; for the year; the batting champion for the year is not recognized as the all-time leader despite having the highest single-season average under the ruling, and Lyons&#x27; hitting streak is not recognized.

Ty Cobb, Sam Rice, and George Sisler are the only players with multiple streaks of 30 games or longer.

There have been 129 single-season streaks of 25 games or more. The lowest batting average ever recorded during a hitting streak of 25 games or more was .304 by Bruce Campbell in 1938. The highest was .486 during Chuck Klein&#x27;s streak in 1930. Joe DiMaggio hit .408 during his record-holding 56-game streak. In probability theory, every baseball game is a Bernoulli trial in which a hitter either does or does not get a hit. DiMaggio&#x27;s streak of 56 consecutive games with hits awaits an equal streak: &quot;The probability is .0003 that a .350 hitter will have a hitting streak of at least 56 games in a season. If there are about four such seasons per year in the future, such a streak would be expected, assuming the Bernoulli trials model, every 1/(.0003 x 4) = 833 years.&quot;

===Major League Baseball records by franchise===
Only currently extant franchises are included on this list. Where a player had a significant streak while the team was in other than its current city, the records in these other cities are displayed. As above, for a multi-year streak, the single-season streak is shown in parentheses.

==Minor League Baseball leaders==
The longest streaks in the history of Minor League Baseball and other professional baseball leagues:

DiMaggio set the Minor League record as a member of the San Francisco Seals. Unrecognized by Minor League Baseball is the 69 game hitting streak by Joe Wilhoit in 1919. Wilhoit was in the independent Western League at the time and his record is considered the all-time Professional Baseball record.

<doc id="428227" wikidata="Q499956" url="?curid=428227" title="Tories (British political party)">
<text>The Tories were a loosely organised political faction and later a political party, in the Parliaments of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. They first emerged during the 1679 Exclusion Crisis, when they opposed Whig efforts to exclude James, Duke of York from the succession on the grounds of his Catholicism. Despite their fervent opposition to state-sponsored Catholicism, Tories opposed his exclusion because of their belief that inheritance based on birth was the foundation of a stable society.

After the succession of George I in 1714, the Tories had no part in government and ceased to exist as an organised political entity in the early 1760s (although the term continued to be used in subsequent years as a term of self-description by some political writers). About twenty years later, a new Tory party arose and participated in government between 1783 and 1830, with William Pitt the Younger followed by Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool. The Whigs won control of Parliament in the 1831 election, which was fought largely on the issue of electoral reform, opposed by the Tories. The Representation of the People Act 1832 removed the rotten boroughs, many of which were controlled by Tories and the Party was reduced to 175 MPs in the 1832 elections.

Under the leadership of Robert Peel, who issued a policy document known as the Tamworth Manifesto, the Tories began to transform into the Conservative Party. However, his repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 caused the party to break apart; the faction led by the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli went on to become the modern Conservative Party, whose members are still commonly referred to as Tories.

== Name ==
As a political term, &quot;Tory&quot; was an insult (derived from the Middle Irish word , modern Irish , meaning &quot;outlaw&quot;, &quot;robber&quot;, from the Irish word , meaning &quot;pursuit&quot; since outlaws were &quot;pursued men&quot;) that entered English politics during the Exclusion Bill crisis of 1678–1681. &quot;Whig&quot; (from &quot;whiggamore&quot;, a &quot;cattle driver&quot;) was initially a Scottish insult for the Covenanter faction in Scotland who opposed the Engagers (a faction who supported Charles I during the Second English Civil War) and supported the Whiggamore Raid that took place in September 1648. While the Whigs were those who supported the exclusion of James, the Duke of York from the succession to thrones of Scotland, England and Ireland (the &quot;Petitioners&quot;), the &quot;Tories&quot; were those who opposed the Exclusion Bill (the Abhorrers).

In 1757, David Hume wrote:
== History ==
=== English Civil War ===
The first Tory party traces its principles and politics to the English Civil War which divided England between the Cavaliers (supporters of King Charles I) and the Roundheads (the supporters of the Long Parliament upon which the King had declared war). This action resulted from the Parliament not allowing him to levy taxes without yielding to its terms. At the beginning of the Long Parliament (1641), the King&#x27;s supporters pursued a course of reform of previous abuses. The increasing radicalism of the Parliamentary majority, however, estranged many reformers even in the Parliament itself and drove them to make common cause with the King. The King&#x27;s party was thus a mixture of supporters of royal autocracy and of those Parliamentarians who felt that the Long Parliament had gone too far in attempting to gain executive power for itself and, more specifically, in undermining the episcopalian government of the Church of England, which was felt to be a primary support of royal government. By the end of the 1640s, the radical Parliamentary programme had become clear: reduction of the King to a powerless figurehead and replacement of Anglican episcopacy with a form of Presbyterianism.

This prospective form of settlement was prevented by a coup d&#x27;état which shifted power from Parliament itself to the Parliamentary New Model Army, controlled by Oliver Cromwell. The Army had King Charles I executed and for the next 11 years the British kingdoms operated under military dictatorship. The Restoration of King Charles II produced a reaction in which the King regained a large part of the power held by his father. However, Charles&#x27; ministers and supporters in England accepted a substantial role for Parliament in the government of the kingdoms. No subsequent British monarch would attempt to rule without Parliament, and after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, political disputes would be resolved through elections and parliamentary manoeuvring, rather than by an appeal to force. Charles II also restored episcopacy in the Church of England. His first Cavalier Parliament began as a strongly royalist body, and passed a series of acts re-establishing the Church by law and strongly punishing dissent by both Roman Catholics and non-Anglican Protestants. These acts did not reflect the King&#x27;s personal views and demonstrated the existence of a Royalist ideology beyond mere subservience to the Court.

A series of disasters in the late 1660s and 1670s discredited Charles II&#x27;s governments, and powerful political interests (including some who had been identified with the Parliamentary side in the Civil War) began to agitate for a greater role of Parliament in government, coupled with more tolerance for Protestant dissenters. These interests would soon coalesce as the Whigs. As direct attacks on the King were politically impossible and could lead to execution for treason, opponents of the power of the Court framed their challenges as exposés of subversive and sinister Catholic plots. Although the matter of these plots was fictitious, they reflected two uncomfortable political realities: first, that Charles II had (somewhat insincerely) undertaken measures to convert the kingdom to Catholicism (in a 1670 treaty with Louis XIV of France); second, that his younger brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, had in fact converted to Catholicism, an act that many Protestant Englishmen in the 1670s saw as only one step below high treason.

The Whigs tried to link the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Duke of Ormonde, with the foremost Irish Tory, Redmond O&#x27;Hanlon, in a supposed plot to murder Titus Oates. The Whig Bishop of Meath, Henry Jones, offered O&#x27;Hanlon a pardon and a bribe if he would testify to Parliament that Ormonde was plotting a French invasion. In December 1680, the government seized these letters and the plan collapsed. In January 1681, the Whigs first began calling the supposed Irish plotters Tories, and on 15 February 1681 is recorded the first complaint from an English Royalist about the epithet Tory by the anti-Exclusion newspaper &quot;Heraclitus Ridens&quot;: &quot;[T]hey call me scurvy names, Jesuit, Papish, Tory; and flap me over the mouth with their being the only True Protestants&quot;. Within a few months, anti-Exclusionists were calling themselves Tories and a northern Dissenter called Oliver Heywood recorded in October: &quot;Ms. H. of Chesterfield told me a gentleman was at their house and had a red Ribband in his hat, she askt him what it meant, he said it signifyed that he was a Tory, whats that sd she, he ans. an Irish Rebel, — oh dreadful that any in England dare espouse that interest. I hear further since that this is the distinction they make instead of Cavalier and Roundhead, now they are called Torys and Wiggs&quot;.

=== The Exclusion Crisis and the Glorious Revolution ===
In a more general sense, the Tories (also known as the Court Party) represented the more conservative royalist supporters of Charles II, who endorsed a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the power of Parliament, and who saw in the Whig opponents of the Court a quasi-Republican tendency (similar to that seen in the Long Parliament) to strip the monarchy of its essential prerogative powers and leave the Crown as a puppet entirely dependent upon Parliament. That the Exclusion Bill was the central question upon which parties diverged, did not hinge upon an assessment of the personal character of the Duke of York (though his conversion to Catholicism was the key factor that made the Bill possible), but rather upon the power of Parliament to elect a monarch of its own choosing, contrary to the established laws of succession. That the Parliament, with the consent of the King, had such power was not at issue; rather, it was the wisdom of a policy of creating a King whose sole title to the Crown was the will of Parliament and who was essentially a Parliamentary appointee.

On this original question, the Tories were in the short run entirely successful as the Parliaments that brought in the Exclusion Bill were dissolved, Charles II was enabled to manage the administration autocratically and upon his death the Duke of York succeeded without difficulty. The rebellion of Monmouth, the candidate of the radical Whigs to succeed Charles II, was easily crushed and Monmouth himself executed. However, in the long run Tory principles were to be severely compromised. Besides the support of a strong monarchy, the Tories also stood for the Church of England, as established in Acts of Parliament following the restoration of Charles II, both as a body governed by bishops, using the Book of Common Prayer whilst subscribing to a specific doctrine and also as an exclusive body established by law, from which both Roman Catholics and Nonconformists were excluded.

During his reign, James II fought for a broadly tolerant religious settlement under which his co-religionists could prosper—a position anathema to conservative Anglicans. James&#x27; attempts to use the government-controlled church to promote policies that undermined the church&#x27;s own unique status in the state led some Tories to support the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The result was a King established solely by parliamentary title and subject to legal controls established by Parliament, the principles that the Tories had originally abhorred. The Tories&#x27; sole consolation was that the monarchs chosen were close to the main line of succession as William III was James II&#x27;s nephew and William&#x27;s wife Mary was James&#x27;s elder daughter. The Act of Toleration 1689 also gave rights to Protestant dissenters that were hitherto unknown, while the elimination of a large number of bishops who refused to swear allegiance to the new monarchs allowed the government to pack the episcopate with bishops with decidedly Whiggish leanings. In both these respects the Tory platform had failed, but the institutions of monarchy and of a state Church survived.

=== Balanced ministries and opposition ===
Despite the failure of their founding principles, the Tories remained a powerful political party during the reigns of the next two monarchs, particularly that of Queen Anne. During this time, the Tories fiercely competed with the Whigs for power, and there were frequent Parliamentary elections in which the two parties measured their strength. William III saw that the Tories were generally more friendly to royal authority than the Whigs, and he employed both groups in his government. His early ministry was largely Tory, but the government gradually came to be dominated by the so-called Junto Whigs. This tight-knit political grouping was opposed by the Country Whigs led by Robert Harley, who gradually merged with the Tory opposition in the later 1690s. Although William&#x27;s successor Anne had considerable Tory sympathies and excluded the Junto Whigs from power, after a brief and unsuccessful experiment with an exclusively Tory government she generally continued William&#x27;s policy of balancing the parties, supported by her moderate Tory ministers, the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin.

The stresses of the War of the Spanish Succession which begun in 1701 led most of the Tories to withdraw into opposition by 1708, so that Marlborough and Godolphin were heading an administration dominated by the Junto Whigs. Anne herself grew increasingly uncomfortable with this dependence on the Whigs, especially as her personal relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough deteriorated. This situation also became increasingly uncomfortable to many of the non-Junto Whigs, led by the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Shrewsbury, who began to intrigue with Robert Harley&#x27;s Tories. In early 1710, the prosecution by the Whig government of the ultra-Tory preacher Henry Sacheverell for sermons delivered the previous year, led to the Sacheverell riots and brought the ministry into popular discredit. In the spring of 1710, Anne dismissed Godolphin and the Junto ministers, replacing them with Tories.

The new Tory ministry was dominated by Harley, Chancellor of the Exchequer (later Lord Treasurer) and Viscount Bolingbroke, Secretary of State. They were backed by a strong majority in the Parliament elected in 1710, rallying under the banner of &quot;Church in Danger&quot;. This Tory government negotiated the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which pulled Great Britain out of the War of the Spanish Succession (to the dismay of Britain&#x27;s allies, including Anne&#x27;s eventual successor, George, Elector of Hanover); the peace was enacted despite a Whig majority in the House of Lords, which Anne defeated by creating new Tory peers. Following a long disagreement between the ministers, Anne dismissed Harley in 1714. The arch-Tory Bolingbroke became in effect Anne&#x27;s chief minister and Tory power seemed to be at its zenith. However, Anne was extremely ill and died within a few days. Bolingbroke had not been able to formulate any coherent plans for dealing with the succession, for if he thought of proclaiming the son of James II (the Pretender) king, he made no moves to do so. The Elector George succeeded to the throne entirely peacefully, supported by the Hanoverian Tory grouping.

=== Proscription and the Whig supremacy ===
In accordance with Succession to the Crown Act 1707, the Queen&#x27;s government was replaced by a Council of Regency until the new King should arrive from Hanover. Bolingbroke offered his services to the King but was coldly rejected; George I brought in a government composed entirely of Whigs, and the new Parliament, elected from January to May 1715, had a large Whig majority. In December 1714 Lord Carnarvon wrote that &quot;hardly one Tory is left in any place, though never so mean a one&quot;. The historian Eveline Cruickshanks stated that &quot;[w]hat took place in 1715 was not a change to an all-Whig ministry, it was a whole social revolution&quot;. For the first time, Tory gentlemen could no longer employ their sons, as they traditionally had done, in public offices such as the Army, Navy, civil service and the Church. Tory officers in the Army had their commissions taken away, Tory lawyers could not now become judges or K.C.s. The predominantly Tory lower Anglican clergy could no longer become bishops and Tory merchants were refused government contracts or directorships in any major company. This proscription lasted for forty-five years. George Lyttelton wrote in his &quot;Letter to the Tories&quot; (1747):
We are kept out of all public employments of power and profit, and live like aliens and pilgrims in the land of our nativity; [...] no quality, no fortune, no eloquence, no learning, no wisdom, no probity is of any use to any man of our unfortunate denomination, ecclesiastic or layman, lawyer or soldier, peer or commoner, for obtaining the most deserved advancement in his profession, or any favour of the Crown; whilst, to our additional and insupportable vexation, the bare merit of hating us, and everything we love and hold sacred, daily advances dunces in the law and church, cowards in our fleets and armies, republicans in the King&#x27;s house, and idiots everywhere!

The Whig government, backed by royal favour and controlling the levers of power, was able to maintain a series of majorities through the infrequent elections of the next several decades (only 7 in the 46 years of the first two Georges, as opposed to 11 in the 26 years from the Revolution to the death of Queen Anne). For much of the period, the Tories commanded a broad base of support in rural England, but the relatively undemocratic nature of the franchise and the maldistribution of the borough seats ensured that this popular appeal was never translated into a Tory majority in Parliament. The Tories would have won every general election between 1715 and 1747 had the number of seats obtained corresponded to the number of votes cast. The Tories were, therefore, an effectively null factor in practical politics, a permanent minority in Parliament and entirely excluded from government. The latter exclusion, and the rigid party politics played by the Whigs, played a significant role in the cohesion of the Tories; the Whigs offered few opportunities for Tories who switched sides, and as a party the Tories found no possibilities for compromise with the Whigs.
The proscription of the Tories alienated them from the Hanoverian regime and converted many of them to Jacobitism. Bolingbroke later wrote: &quot;If milder measures had been pursued, certain it is that the Tories had never universally embraced Jacobitism. The violence of the Whigs forced them into the arms of the Pretender&quot;. In October 1714, the French ambassador Charles-François d&#x27;Iberville noted that the number of Jacobites in the Tory party was increasing and in early 1715 he wrote that the Tories seemed to be &quot;heading for civil war which they regard as their only resort&quot;. The former Tory chief minister, Lord Oxford, was impeached and sent to the Tower, with Bolingbroke and the Tory peer the Duke of Ormonde fleeing to France to join the Pretender. A series of riots against the coronation of George I and the new Hanoverian-Whig regime (in which the mob voiced their support for Jacobitism and local Tory parliamentary candidates) led to the Whig government strengthening their power by passing the Riot Act, suspending &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and increasing the army (including by importing 6,000 Dutch troops).

Louis XIV had promised them arms but no troops, as France was exhausted by war, despite Bolingbroke&#x27;s claim that just one-tenth of the number of troops William of Orange brought with him in 1688 would have sufficed. However, this promise of arms disappeared when Louis died in September 1715. The conspirators intended to abandon the rising they had planned for the West Country, but the Scots forced their hand by unilaterally raising the Pretender&#x27;s standard. One of Ormonde&#x27;s agents betrayed the plans for an English rising and subsequently the government arrested many Tory MPs, ex MPs and peers. The subsequent Jacobite rebellion of 1715–16 resulted in failure. However, Charles XII of Sweden was willing to aid the English Tories by sending troops to put the Pretender on the throne, in conjunction with an English rising. Lord Oxford, who had already in 1716 offered the Pretender his services, directed the Swedish Plot from the Tower. In January 1717, the government discovered this plot and won a vote of credit for defence measures against the projected invasion in the Commons against Tory opposition. Charles&#x27; death in 1718 ended hopes from that quarter and Ormonde&#x27;s planned Spanish invasion was destroyed by a storm at sea.

During the Whig Split of 1717, the Tories refused to back either side and adopted the same stance to Lord Sunderland&#x27;s overtures in 1720. Nonetheless, their combined efforts helped the opposition win some victories, such as the defeat of the Peerage Bill in 1719. In 1722, Sunderland advised the King to admit leading Tories into government, thereby dividing them and ending their hopes for revenge by looking for support from abroad. He also advised the King in Cabinet that elections to Parliament should be free from government bribery, an idea Sir Robert Walpole opposed due to the possibility of the election of a Tory Parliament. The King was also opposed: &quot;King George stared the Earl of Sunderland in the face at the name of a Tory Parliament, for it seems nothing is so hideous and frightful to him as a Tory&quot;. The public outcry over the South Sea Bubble led the Tories to believe that it would not be worthwhile raising funds for the general election, as they considered a Jacobite rising would be successful considering the state of public opinion.

Sunderland joined the Tories in the Atterbury Plot, in which the Pretender was to be put on the throne. A rising was planned for each county, assisted by Irish and Spanish troops. However, Sunderland&#x27;s death in April 1722 led to the government discovering the plot and it subsequently collapsed. When the Commons voted on the bill of pains and penalties against Atterbury, nearly ninety per cent of Tory MPs voted against it. Although the Whig Prime Minister Robert Walpole decided not to prosecute those Tories that he knew were involved in the plot, the Tories were demoralised and largely absented themselves from Parliament for a time. Upon the accession of George II in 1727 and the ensuing general election, the Tories were reduced to 128 MPs, their lowest total up to this point.

The Tories were divided over whether to cooperate with the opposition Whigs against Walpole, with those in favour consisting of the Hanoverian faction led by Sir William Wyndham and with those opposed making up the Jacobite faction headed by William Shippen. Most Tories opposed voting with the opposition Whigs, only reversing this stance when the Pretender sent a letter to the Tories in 1730, ordering them to &quot;unite in the measures against the Government and even with those who oppose it for different views than theirs&quot;. For the next decade, the Tories cooperated with the opposition Whigs against Walpole. Public admission of Jacobitism was treason, so the Tories challenged the Hanoverian-Whig regime without specifically addressing it by developing a rhetoric borrowed from the Whigs of the Exclusion Crisis; they denounced government corruption and the high taxation needed to spend on foreign entanglements, opposed the growth of the Army and denounced &quot;tyranny&quot; and &quot;arbitrary power&quot;. In a speech on the Army estimates, Walpole claimed that &quot;No man of common prudence will profess himself openly a Jacobite; by so doing he not only may injure his private fortune, but he must render himself less able to do any effectual service to the cause he has embraced...Your right Jacobite, Sir, disguises his true sentiments, he roars out for revolution principles; he pretends to be a great friend to liberty&quot;. He further claimed that a large Army was needed to defeat any possible Jacobite invasion.

In 1737, Frederick, Prince of Wales applied to Parliament for an increased allowance. This split the Tories, with 45 abstaining, leading to the motion being defeated by 30 votes. Bolingbroke, who wanted to dissociate the Tories from Jacobitism, denounced this as &quot;the absurd behaviour of the Tories, which no experience can cure&quot;. In 1738 Frederick&#x27;s attempts to reconcile with the Tories broke down on Wyndham&#x27;s insistence that he join the Tories in favouring a reduced Army.With the outbreak of war against Spain in 1739, there was renewed plotting amongst Tories for a Jacobite rising. Wyndham&#x27;s death in 1740 led to the breakdown of the coalition between the Tories and opposition Whigs. An opposition Whig motion for Walpole&#x27;s dismissal was defeated by 290 to 106, with many Tories abstaining. At the general election of 1741, there were 136 Tories elected.

The Tories resumed their cooperation with the opposition Whigs after receiving another letter from the Pretender in September 1741, ordering them to &quot;pursue vigorous and unanimous measures in the next session of Parliament. [...] They will probably have many occasions of greatly distressing the present Government and ministry and perhaps find some who will concur with them in that, though not out of goodwill to my cause. [...] In such cases I hope my friends will make no scruples in joining heartily with them for whatever their particular motives may be anything that tends to the disadvantage of the present Government and to the bringing it into confusion cannot be but of advantage to my cause&quot;. As a result, 127 Tories joined the opposition Whigs in successfully voting against Walpole&#x27;s nominated chairman of the elections committee in December 1741. The Tories continued to vote against Walpole with the opposition Whigs in subsequent divisions until Walpole was forced to resign in February 1742. The Pretender wrote to the Tories afterwards, declaring: &quot;I cannot delay any longer expressing to you my satisfaction at the late behaviour of my friends in Parliament, and I take it as a great mark of their singular regard for what I wrote to you some months ago&quot;.

In 1743, war broke out between Britain and France, as part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession. Later that year Francis Sempill, the Pretender&#x27;s representative at the French court, carried a message from English Tories to the French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Jean-Jacques Amelot de Chaillou) requesting French help for a Stuart restoration (including 10,000 French soldiers). It was signed by the Duke of Beaufort (one of the four richest people in Britain), Lord Barrymore, Lord Orrery, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, Sir John Hynde Cotton and Sir Robert Abdy. Amelot replied that the French government would need considerable proof of English support for Jacobitism before it could act.

James Butler, Louis XV&#x27;s Master of Horse, toured England ostensibly for purchasing bloodstock but in reality to gauge the health of Jacobitism in England, visiting leading Tories. Before he left for England. the French king briefed him personally to assure Tory leaders that all of their demands would be met. In November 1743 Amelot told Sempill officially that Louis XV was resolved to restore the House of Stuart and that he was planning a French invasion headed by the Pretender&#x27;s son, Charles Edward Stuart. The &quot;Declaration of King James&quot; (written by Tory leaders) was signed by the Pretender on 23 December. This was to be published in the event of a successful French landing. However, the Whig government was informed by a spy of the intended French invasion and King George told Parliament on 15 February 1744 that a French invasion was planned, assisted by &quot;disaffected persons from this country&quot;. The House of Commons passed a loyal address by 287 to 123. The Tories&#x27; insistence for the House to divide on this occasion seemed to the government a design by the Tories &quot;to show the French what numbers in the House they might depend on&quot;. The Tories also opposed increasing the armed forces, it being noted &quot;that none of the leaders amongst the Tories, either on this occasion or that of the King&#x27;s first message, showed the least sign of zeal or affection to the Government&quot;.

On 24 February, a storm scattered the French invasion fleet and suspected Jacobites were arrested, leading to the French government cancelling their planned invasion. Charles Stuart, who was still in France and determined to start a Jacobite rising, looked to Scotland. However, the English Tories would only support a rising in Scotland if accompanied by a French invasion near London to aid the English Tories in their own rising. The English Tories repeatedly told the Jacobite court that only regular soldiers invading at the same time as their rising could achieve a Stuart restoration.

In December 1744, the Broadbottom Administration was formed, which included a handful of Tories in minor offices. Some other Tories were offered places, but those serving for Jacobite counties &quot;could not hazard a new election and therefore decline[d] the acceptance of them&quot;. One of the Tories who accepted office, Sir John Cotton, did not swear the oath of loyalty to King George and informed the French King that he still favoured a Jacobite French invasion; he added that the Tories in office would try to ensure that more British soldiers were sent to Flanders from England in order to help a French invasion. After Lord Gower took office in this government, the Tories no longer looked to him as their leader as Lyttleton wrote that &quot;when it was discovered that Gower was really a friend to the Hanover succession, the Tories discarded him for being their leader, and adopted a determined Jacobite the Duke of Beaufort in his stead&quot;. In June 1745, the Tory leaders in the Commons, Wynn and Cotton (together with Beaufort), informed the Jacobite court that &quot;if the Prince [Charles] lands in present circumstances with ten battalions or even smaller body of troops there will be no opposition&quot;. Tory leaders sent Robert MacCarty to France with a request for 10,000 troops and 30,000 arms to be landed in England, where they would join them upon arrival.

Charles travelled to Scotland in July without consulting the Tories or the French and without a sizeable body of troops. After his landing, Sempill wrote: &quot;The City of London, Sir John Hynde Cotton, Lord Barrymore, the Duke of Beaufort, and all the English cry loudly and vehemently for a body of troops to be landed near London, as the most effectual means to support the Prince&quot;. They could not rise for the Prince without &quot;a body of troops to support them&quot;, but they &quot;would join the Prince if His Highness could force his way to them&quot;. Throughout the Jacobite rising of 1745, Charles could not establish contact with the English Tories. Captain Nagle, who had visited a peer in London, reported in December that they were all being monitored by the government, but that they would declare for Charles if he made his way to London or if the French invaded. However, Charles retreated from England and the French never landed, so the English Tories did not feel safe in coming out for the Pretender. After the collapse of the rising, Charles&#x27; captured secretary, John Murray of Broughton, informed the government of the Tories&#x27; conspiracy with the Pretender. The government decided not to prosecute them. The trial of the Scottish rebel lords in London was boycotted by most Tory peers. After the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s brutal suppression of the Scots, English Tories adopted the plaid as their symbol.

Eveline Cruickshanks in her study of the 1715-1754 Tory party for &quot;The History of Parliament&quot;, stated that &quot;the available evidence leaves no doubt that up to 1745 the Tories were a predominantly Jacobite party, engaged in attempts to restore the Stuarts by a rising with foreign assistance&quot;. Sir Lewis Namier noticed that for the reigns of George I and George II, Tory family papers are non-existent. As papers from before 1715 and after 1760 survive, Cruickshanks contends that these families were hiding their Jacobite leanings by destroying incriminating papers. A nineteenth-century historian who had examined many collections such as these, claimed that it was &quot;the custom in Jacobite days to destroy all letters with any hint of political or religious feeling in them&quot;. However, some historians (such as Linda Colley) have questioned the Tories&#x27; commitment to Jacobitism. In 2016, Frank O&#x27;Gorman noted that given the nature of the evidence, it is unlikely that the question will ever be answered, but added that &quot;judged by the acid test of how they behaved in the &#x27;15 and &#x27;45 most Tories showed themselves to be Hanoverian and not Jacobite&quot;.

In 1747, Prince Frederick invited the Tories &quot;to unite and coalesce with him&quot; and declared his intention that when he became King, he would &quot;abolish...all distinction of the party&quot; and put an end to the proscription of the Tories. A meeting of leading Tories (including Beaufort, Wynn and Cotton) accepted the Prince&#x27;s offer and replied assuring him of their support for his &quot;wise and salutary purposes&quot;. However, they refused to pledge themselves to a coalition with Whigs. The 1747 general election resulted in only 115 Tory MPs being elected, their lowest figure up until this point. After Jacobite riots in Oxford in 1748, the government wanted to give the King the power to nominate the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, which was considered a hotbed of Jacobitism and Toryism. Thomas Carte wrote to the Pretender that &quot;the attempt against the university of Oxford brought them all up at once to town, which nothing else would, and in their zeal on that account, they entered into a sort of coalition with Prince Frederick&#x27;s party to stand by the university of Oxford, to join in opposing all unconstitutional points, but to be under no obligation to visit Prince Frederick&#x27;s court, nor unite in other points&quot;.

After Wynn&#x27;s death in 1749, a Jacobite agent reported to the Pretender that the Tory party was &quot;without a head&quot;, dispirited and frightened. In 1751 Frederick died, followed in 1752 by Cotton. This effectively ended opposition in Parliament for the rest of the session. Horace Walpole, in his memoirs for 1764, wrote of the decline of the Tory party: Hitherto it might be said that the two parties of Whig and Tory still subsisted; though Jacobitism, the concealed mother of the latter, was extinct...The subsequent contests were rather a struggle for power than the settled animosity of two parties, though the body of Opposition still called itself Whig, an appellation rather dropped than disclaimed by the Court; and though the real Tories still adhered to their own distinctions while they secretly favoured, sometimes opposed, the Court, and fluctuated accordingly as they esteemed particular chiefs not of their connection or had the more agreeable opportunity of distressing those who supported the cause of freedom. As their whole conduct was comprised in silent votes, and never was considerable enough to turn a single scale in the political changes, I shall seldom mention them anymore.

===Friends of Mr Pitt===
Dickinson reports the following:
All historians are agreed that the Tory party declined sharply in the late 1740s and 1750s and that it ceased to be an organized party by 1760. The research of Sir Lewis Namier and his disciples [...] has convinced all historians that there were no organized political parties in Parliament between the late 1750s and the early 1780s. Even the Whigs ceased to be an identifiable party, and Parliament was dominated by competing political connections, which all proclaimed Whiggish political views, or by independent backbenchers unattached to any particular group.

Upon the accession of George III, the old political distinctions dissolved. The Whig factions became in effect distinct parties (such as the Grenvillites and the Bedfordites), all of whom claimed the Whig mantle, while the material distinction in politics was between the &quot;King&#x27;s Friends&quot; who supported the newly activist role of George III in government, and those who opposed the king. The proscription on the employment of Tories in government offices ended, which resulted in the Tories dividing into several factions and ceasing to function as a coherent political party. Sentimental Toryism remained, as in the writings of Samuel Johnson, but in politics &quot;Tory&quot; was little more than an unfriendly epithet for politicians closely identified with George III. The label &quot;Tory&quot; was in this sense applied to the Prime Ministers Lord Bute (1762–1763) and Lord North (1770–1782), but these politicians considered themselves Whigs. In his study of the debates in Parliament for 1768–1774, PDG Thomas discovered that not a single politician labelled themselves a Tory. JCD Clark similarly argues: &quot;The history of the Tory party in parliament between the early 1760s and the late 1820s may be simply written: it did not exist&quot;.
Applied by their opponents to parliamentary supporters of the younger William Pitt (1783–1801, 1804–1806), the term &quot;Tories&quot; came to represent the political current opposed to the &quot;Old Whigs&quot; and the radicalism unleashed by the American and French Revolutions. This was reinforced by the breakup of the Whig party in 1794 when the conservative group led by the Duke of Portland joined Pitt&#x27;s ministry, leaving an opposition rump led by Charles James Fox. The historian JCD Clark has written of the 1790s: &quot;It cannot be too clearly stressed that no public figure at that date accepted the title &#x27;Tory&#x27;, and that they had the best reasons for denying its appropriateness&quot;. Pitt rejected the Tory label, preferring to refer to himself as an independent Whig, for he believed in the current constitutional arrangement as being well balanced, without particular favour towards the royal prerogative, unlike the Tories of the first half of the 18th century.

The group surrounding Pitt the Younger came to be the dominant force in British politics from 1783 until 1830 and, after Pitt&#x27;s death (1806), the ministers in the Portland ministry (1807–1809) called themselves the &quot;Friends of Mr Pitt&quot; rather than Tories. Portland&#x27;s successor, Spencer Perceval (Prime Minister, 1809–1812), never adopted the label of Tory and, after his assassination in 1812, the members of the government of Lord Liverpool (1812–1827) firmly rejected it in a ministerial memorandum to the Prince Regent: It is almost unnecessary to observe that the British Government had for more than a century been and could only be a Whig Government; and that the present administration is, as every administration in this country must necessarily be, a Whig administration. For a Whig Government means now, as it has all along meant, nothing else than a Government established by laws equally binding upon the King and the subject.
Generally, the Tories were associated with lesser gentry, the Church of England and the Episcopal Church in Scotland while Whigs were more associated with trade, money, larger land holders or land magnates and the Nonconformist Protestant churches. Both were still committed to the political system in place at that time. The new Tory party was distinct both in composition and ideological orientation from the old. It consisted largely of former Whigs, alienated from the party that now bore that name. While it maintained a sentimental and conservative respect for the symbolic institutions of the British monarchy, in practice Tory ministries allowed the King no more freedom than Whig ones. The incompetence of George III&#x27;s personal interventions in policy had been sufficiently shown in the American War (1775–1783), henceforward his active role was limited to negations of government policies such as the Catholic emancipation. In foreign policy, the differences were even more marked as the old Tory party had been pacific and isolationist whereas the new one was bellicose and imperialistic.

===Conservative Party===
The Tories became associated with repression of popular discontent after 1815, but the Tories later underwent a fundamental transformation under the influence of Robert Peel, who was an industrialist rather than a landowner. Peel in his 1834 Tamworth Manifesto outlined a new conservative philosophy of reforming ills while conserving the good. The subsequent Peel administrations have been labelled Conservative rather than Tory, but the older term remains in use.

When the Conservative Party split in 1846 on the issue of free trade (namely, the repeal of the Corn Laws), the protectionist wing of the party rejected the Conservative label. They preferred to be known as Protectionists or even to revive the older Tory as an official name. By 1859 the Peelites (Peel&#x27;s Conservative supporters) joined the Whigs and Radicals to form the Liberal Party. The remaining Tories, under the leadership of the Earl of Derby (a former Whig) and Disraeli (once a Radical candidate for Parliament), adopted the Conservative label as the official name of their party.

<text>The Henie Onstad Kunstsenter is an art museum located at Høvikodden in Bærum municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is situated on a headland jutting into the Oslofjord, approximately southwest of Oslo.

==History==
The artcentre was founded in 1968 by World and Olympic champion figure skater Sonja Henie (1912–1969) and her husband, shipping magnate and art collector Niels Onstad (1909–1978). Their private collection of contemporary art, total 110 images, as well as funds for construction and operation of the centre was donated by the couple in 1961, when the Sonja Henie and Niels Onstad Foundation was created. The centre, designed by Norwegian architects Jon Eikvar and Sven Erik Engebretsen, also contains Sonja Henie&#x27;s award collection.

In 1994, the building was extended, and a two-story wing with exhibition spaces and technical rooms was added. This project was designed by the same architects—the new wing abuts the main body of the building as an organic extension. In 2003, another extension was made, this time in the form of an annex that extends into the outdoor park, connected to the main building by a passage leading from the lower level. In addition to six exhibition halls, the Centre also has an auditorium and smaller meeting rooms. Today, the total building area is approximately 9,500 square metres, of which 3,500 are occupied by exhibition spaces.

==Present==
Henie Onstad Kunstsenter organizes exhibitions and performances. Art center is visited by around 100,000 people each year. The centre celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2008 with exhibitions, seminars, book, concert and movie titled &quot;Høvikodden LIVE&quot;.

In 2019 the Henie Onstad Kunstsenter hosted the first FIDE World Fischer Random Chess Championship.

==Controversy==
After being identified in an exhibition catalogue in 2012 by the family of noted French-Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg, it was demanded that the HOK return &quot;Profil bleu devant la cheminée&quot; (Woman in Blue in Front of Fireplace) (1937), a Matisse painting that was confiscated by the Nazis in 1941. Museum Director Tone Hansen said the museum did not know the painting was stolen by the Nazis, until it was notified by the Rosenberg family.

Rosenberg had bought the painting direct from Matisse in 1937, and had it stored at the time of the 1940 Nazi invasion of France in a bank vault in Libourne, a commune in the Gironde department in Aquitaine, southwestern France. The Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg entered the vault in March 1941 to confiscate the art pieces, and after cataloging at Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in September 1941, it was designated to the private collection of Hermann Göring. Then via various dealers during the Nazi period, post-war in the late 1940s it was bought by Niels Onstad from the Paris-based dealer Henri Bénézit. It has since appeared in numerous publications, and toured the world on several occasions. Although under Norwegian law, due to the period of ownership the painting now belongs to HOK, Norway was one of 44 signatories to the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. Protracted mediation, overseen by Christopher A. Marinello, saw the painting returned to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg in March 2014.

As a result, the Henie Onstad Kunstsenter launched a Provenance Project.

<text>Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe (12 January 185820 June 1945), known as The Honourable Robert Milnes from 1863 to 1885, The Lord Houghton from 1885 to 1895 and as The Earl of Crewe from 1895 to 1911, was a British Liberal politician, statesman and writer.

==Early life==
Robert Offley Ashburton Milnes was born at 16 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London, the only son of Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, by his wife the Hon. Annabella Crewe, daughter of John Crewe, 2nd Baron Crewe, and was educated firstly at Winton House, near Winchester, and then Harrow. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1880.

==Political career==
A Liberal in politics, Milnes became Assistant Private Secretary to Lord Granville in April 1883 when Granville was Foreign Secretary. In an 1884 by-election he was the losing Liberal candidate at Barnsley. As Baron Houghton, he was made Liberal whip in 1885. In January 1886 he was made a Lord-in-waiting to Queen Victoria during the Third Gladstone ministry, and remained a Home Ruler.

Prepared for ministerial success, a severe blow was struck to a burgeoning political career: his wife Sybil Marcia, daughter of Sir Frederick Ulric Graham, 3rd Baronet of Netherby, whom he had married on 3 June 1880, died suddenly in September 1887, still only thirty years old. He was determined to get over this personal tragedy by studying agriculture at the Royal Agricultural College. However, he was prevented by illness from pursuing his studies. Leaving England, he travelled to Egypt where the &quot;Stray Verses&quot; were written in a somewhat mournful lament at his great loss. Further melancholy hit hard when his eight-year-old son and heir Richard died in 1890.

Returning to Houghton in 1892, he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the Liberal government, 1892–1895, in which his old friend Lord Rosebery eventually became prime minister.

On the death of his uncle, Hungerford Crewe, 3rd Baron Crewe, he inherited vast estates of nearly 50,000 acres in four counties, and assumed the same year the additional surname of Crewe by royal licence on 8 June 1894. On 17 July 1895 he was created Earl of Crewe, in the County palatine of Chester.

On 20 April 1899, he married an eighteen-year-old society beauty, Lady Margaret Etrenne Hannah Primrose, daughter of the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery.

The Second Boer War broke out only months later in October. Crewe remained a leader of the conciliators who to the last tried to find a negotiated settlement with President Paul Kruger. He began to grow apart from his father-in-law&#x27;s Liberal imperialism, advocating a gradualist &quot;step-by-step&quot; policy of containment of the situation. But the war soon escalated with Crewe finding himself isolated. He was not much of an orator, but had skills in administration, proving an efficient organizer. He became increasingly influential with Henry Campbell-Bannerman and the Radicals. He made a personal friend out of H. H. Asquith, who was his political mainstay in the round of intrigues that intensified during the lead-up to the First World War. A close confidante he was appointed as an aide on almost every committee. From 1905 to 1908 he was Lord President of the Council in the Liberal government. The House of Lords, dominated by Tory peers, were hostile to Asquith&#x27;s proposed reforms. They wrecked the Education Bill of 1906, while Crewe stood out as the main defender of the Cabinet&#x27;s policy. In response to pleas from Campbell-Bannerman, he assumed the role of cross-party convenor. Crewe was moderate in all things. He deplored David Lloyd George&#x27;s Limehouse Speech in the east end of London in support of the People&#x27;s Budget. By the same token, he found it unacceptable for die-hard Tories and Unionists to continue to block legislation.

Although Lord Elgin reassured him of Winston Churchill&#x27;s friendliness among Liberals, Crewe was in for a rude shock: he had succeeded the orientalist Elgin as Secretary of State for the Colonies, and in May 1908 he had an angry exchange of letters with Churchill who had intervened in a colonial debate in the Commons. Crewe could be haughty and coldly disapproving: alike to Grey he took a dim view of Lloyd George&#x27;s People&#x27;s Budget. It was Crewe&#x27;s job to steer it through the Lords. In his capacity as Leader of the House of Lords he played a key role in bringing the Parliament Act 1911 (depriving the Lords of its veto) to the floor of the house and eventually onto the statute book. Asquith valued him highly as a colleague, for his common sense and sound judgment rather than any exceptional brilliance. But when Churchill circulated a memorandum proposing the abolition of the Lords in 1910, Crewe remained essentially whiggish and cautious, blocking any attempt to change the bicameral relationship. He sat on the Constitutional Conference Commission set up on 16 June 1910 during the crisis following Edward VII&#x27;s death. The inconclusive outcome of the January 1910 election, which increased Unionist representation in the Commons, caused a wide-ranging debate on the constitutional implications of the Lords&#x27; powers. The new king, George V, to obviate a stalemate agreed to create 500 new peers, should the Liberals win the December 1910 election. Crewe was present at the discussions as one of the Inner Sanctum in the cabinet. He had previously taken a more right-wing position with Asquith arguing for reform of the &quot;membership &quot;of the Upper House, rather than of its customary powers. Crewe was selected to face leading Tory Lord Cromer, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, in negotiation of the provisions of the Veto bill, which would give a whip hand to an elected Commons.

It was his colonial responsibilities from September 1910 as part of his terms as Secretary of State for India (1910–11 and 1911–15), for which he gained the hoped-for promotion in the peerage. The Delhi Durbar was an invention of his genius for organization, designed to the last detail for the first British monarch in history to pay a visit to India. In that post, he was responsible for the removal of the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi, and the reunion of the two Bengals under a Governor-in-Council, as well as commissioning the architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens for his outstanding visionary grand design of New Delhi. He was further honoured in 1911 when he was created Earl of Madeley and Marquess of Crewe.

In at least one of Asquith&#x27;s cabinet lists 1913–14, Crewe was at the top; but other ministers, like Churchill, were more thrusting at pushing themselves forward for promotion. Crewe was widely respected for his administrative competence, efficiency and personal intelligence. Crewe served as Lord President of the Council again from May 1915, coming second in Asquith&#x27;s rankings and working closely with Lloyd George on currency and exchange rate stabilisation in the budget. His home at Crewe House, Curzon Street in Mayfair became a centre for war propaganda.

In 1916 he was appointed briefly as President of the Board of Education, and may have been useful in the post-war educational sector, but the Asquith coalition split in December. He remained as ever, an Asquithian, declining office under Lloyd George, and after his resignation, he continued to lead the independent Liberal opposition in the House of Lords. He took the largely honorific title of Chairman of London County Council. He maintained a leading role in the education sector, serving as Chairman of the Governing Body of Imperial College London (1907–22), and Chancellor of Sheffield University. He was later Ambassador to France appointed by Bonar Law from October (1922–28). As Ambassador to France, he launched a fund for the creation of a British Institute in Paris, which has since developed into the University of London Institute in Paris (ULIP). He had a very brief ten-week stint as Secretary of State for War in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s National Coalition from August 1931, but did not hold office after the general election. The Samuelite Liberals withdrew over free trade from the National Coalition in 1932. From 1936 and throughout the Second World War Crewe was leader of the Independent Liberals in the House of Lords. He served as Lord High Constable of England for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.

=== Public-speaker ===
He did not much like public speaking, but that was probably because he contrasted sharply with Lloyd George&#x27;s firebrand delivery and populist demagogy. Crewe himself tended to hesitate too long time with &quot;pregnant pauses&quot;, as his speech became stilted. He was above all fastidious in the royal tradition of Charles I. Edwin Montagu claimed, somewhat sardonically, that one of his female constituents died of boredom listening to the Marquess. His father-in-law, Lord Rosebery, had been Liberal Leader six years before he himself became Leader in the House of Lords of that party. Rosebery thought Crewe a reliable politician but a poor speaker. When it was announced to him that his daughter, the Marchioness of Crewe, was in labour, Rosebery is said to have quipped &quot;I hope that her delivery is not as slow as Crewe&#x27;s&quot;. Always at ease in London High Society, Crewe hosted the dinner party at which Winston Churchill met Clementine Hozier.

=== Political positions ===

Crewe voiced his support during his time in Parliament for numerous reforms, including old-age pensions, an eight-hour day for miners, and meal provisions for schoolchildren. In November 1905, Crewe had written to (then) Party leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman of the need for innovative reform on the part of the Liberals, noting that

More than ever before, the Liberal Party is on its trial as an engine for securing social reforms, – taxation, land, housing, etc. It has to resist the I.L.P. claim to be the only friend of the workers. Can it do this and attempt Home Rule as well?

During the Liberal party crises of 1886, 1909–11, and 1916, he stayed loyal to the party. He was also said to have acknowledged the damage the First World War did to liberalism. When he died James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury described Crewe as &quot;the best of the whig statesmen&quot;. One historian believed his whiggery was more temperamental than ideological. Reserved and stiff upper-lipped by nature he sought compromise by mediation attempting to negotiate a middle way. His meetings were often spontaneous and informal, but dominated by an aristocratic clique: Lloyd George recalled how in 1912 Crewe had tried at Deeside to resolve Ulster&#x27;s longstanding problems with Bonar Law over a round of golf.

==Literary work==
Crewe inherited his father&#x27;s literary tastes, and published for public consumption &quot;Stray Verses&quot; in 1890, besides other miscellaneous literary work, including &quot;Gleanings from Béranger&quot; (privately printed in 1889), much of which he translated. A war poem, —which touches on the theme of &quot;what might have been&quot;—was published in several anthologies during and following World War I. Lord Crewe was the last of the Liberal grandees at the end of Empire. He was essentially by character a Victorian, and this showed in his austere reverential writings that took few risks with the material.

Soon after the death of his father-in-law the 5th Earl of Rosebery in 1929, the family asked Crewe to write his biography. The two-volume &quot;Lord Rosebery&quot; was published by John Murray in 1931. Crewe&#x27;s dedication reads &quot;To my wife – this attempt to tell the story of one we both loved&quot;.

==Death==
Crewe died on 20 June 1945 at the age of 87. His body was buried in the graveyard of Saint Bertoline&#x27;s Church in the Cheshire village of Barthomley. As he had no surviving male heir, both his sons (one from each marriage) having died in childhood, his titles became extinct upon his death.

==Family==

Crewe married twice. In 1880, he married Sibyl Marcia Graham (1857–1887), daughter of Sir Frederick Graham, 3rd Baronet, of Netherby in the County of Cumberland. They had three daughters and one son, who died as a child:
* Lady Annabel Crewe-Milnes (1881–1948). She married twice. In 1903, she married Arthur O&#x27;Neill (1876–1914), later Ulster Unionist MP for Mid Antrim. Their third son, Terence O&#x27;Neill, was to become Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Her second marriage was to Hugh Dodds to whom she bore two sons, the writer Quentin Crewe and Colin Crewe.
* Hon. Richard Charles Rodes Milnes (1882–1890), died in childhood.
* Lady Celia Hermione Crewe-Milnes (1884–1985), twin with her sister Cynthia. She married Sir Edward Clive Milnes-Coates, 2nd Baronet.
* Lady Helen Cynthia Crewe-Milnes, Mrs Colville, DBE (1884–1968). Twin with her sister, Celia. She married the Hon. George Charles Colville (1867–1943) and was mother of Sir John Colville who served as a Private Secretary to Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee.

In 1899, more than a decade after his first wife&#x27;s death, the 41-year-old Crewe married again. At eighteen years of age, the bride was around the same age as Crewe&#x27;s eldest daughter. She was Lady Margaret Etrenne Hannah Primrose, daughter of the 5th Earl of Rosebery. As Lady Crewe, she became one of the first seven women appointed as magistrates in 1919 following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919. They had two children, a son and a daughter, and again the son died in childhood. The children were:

* Richard George Archibald John Lucian Hungerford Crewe-Milnes, Earl of Madeley (1911–1922),
* Lady Mary Evelyn Hungerford Crewe-Milnes (1915–2014), first wife of the 9th Duke of Roxburghe.
