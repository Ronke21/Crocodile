<text>Todd Bertuzzi (born February 2, 1975) is a Canadian professional ice hockey winger of the National Hockey League (NHL). Known as a power forward, he has played in the NHL for the New York Islanders, Vancouver Canucks, Florida Panthers, Anaheim Ducks, Calgary Flames and Detroit Red Wings. He is widely known for his role in the Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident, for which he was suspended by the NHL and IIHF, and criminally charged.

Selected 23rd overall by the New York Islanders in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, he played at the junior level with the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for four seasons. In 1995–96, he played his rookie season with the Islanders. After seasons with the Islanders, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks. Bertuzzi enjoyed the most successful seasons of his career with the Canucks—his longest tenured team in the NHL—including NHL first team All-Star honours in 2003. In 2006, after seasons with Vancouver, Bertuzzi was dealt to the Florida Panthers, for whom he briefly played until being traded again, this time to the Red Wings. He then played single seasons with the Anaheim Ducks and the Calgary Flames before returning to Detroit in 2009 and finishing his career there. Internationally, Bertuzzi has competed for Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, as well as the 1998 and 2000 World Championships.

He is the uncle of Tyler Bertuzzi, who plays in the NHL.

==Playing career==

===Guelph Storm (1991–95)===
After playing for two minor hockey teams based out of Sudbury, Ontario in 1990–91, Bertuzzi was selected in the first round (fifth overall) by the Guelph Storm in the 1991 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection. His future coach with the Vancouver Canucks, Marc Crawford, passed on Bertuzzi during the draft while he was general manager of the Cornwall Royals; he has recalled not selecting him due to &quot;maturity issues&quot; and that he was &quot;a big kid who hadn&#x27;t grown into his body yet.&quot; Bertuzzi started his OHL career for Guelph in 1991–92, recording 21 points over 42 games as a rookie. He missed the last 15 games of the regular season due to suspension as a result of kicking opposing defenceman Brad Barton during a contest between the Storm and Kitchener Rangers. After improving to 58 points over 60 games in 1992–93, he was selected 23rd overall by the New York Islanders in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau described Bertuzzi as a physical and strong player with good skating who checks hard and is offensively effective in close proximity to the net.

Following his NHL draft, he underwent surgery for chipped bones in his left elbow in August 1993. As a result, he was unable to participate in the Islanders&#x27; training camp in September and was returned to the OHL. Playing in his third season for Guelph, he improved to 28 goals and 82 points over 61 games. Bertuzzi competed for an Islanders&#x27; roster spot at their 1994 training camp, but was sent back to his junior team after going scoreless in three exhibition games.

During his last campaign with Guelph in 1994–95, he recorded 119 points – sixth overall in the league. His 54 goals established a single-season team record, beating Mike Prokopec&#x27;s mark, set the previous year, by two goals. The Storm&#x27;s forward tandem of Bertuzzi and Jeff O&#x27;Neill, who finished fourth in league scoring, led the club to the best regular season record in the league. He went on to add a team-leading 33 points in 14 playoff games, en route to an OHL Finals loss to the Detroit Junior Red Wings. After four seasons with Guelph, he left the club ranked third all-time in career points with 280, behind O&#x27;Neill and Martin St. Pierre.

===New York Islanders (1995–98)===
Two years after his draft, Bertuzzi and the Islanders had not yet agreed to a contract. With Bertuzzi eligible to re-enter the draft if the Islanders did not sign him by July 7, 1995, general manager Don Maloney made it apparent that he would use the team&#x27;s second overall pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft to select him again if a contract could not be agreed upon by the required date. Moments before the midnight deadline, the Islanders were able to sign Bertuzzi to a four-year, US$4.6 million contract. His agent, Pat Morris, had reportedly wanted a similar deal to that of fellow Islanders prospect Brett Lindros – a five-year, $6.7 million contract signed the previous summer.

During training camp in September 1995, Islanders head coach Mike Milbury heralded Bertuzzi as the team&#x27;s best performing forward. Making his NHL debut on October 7, 1995, he scored a wrap around goal against goaltender Blaine Lacher in a 4–4 tie with the Boston Bruins. Beginning the season on the team&#x27;s top line with Žigmund Pálffy and Travis Green, Bertuzzi finished his rookie year with 18 goals and 39 points over 76 games. The following season, Bertuzzi recorded 23 points in 64 games. The Islanders did not qualify for the playoffs in either of his two full seasons with the club, ranking second-last in the Eastern Conference in 1995–96 and 1996–97.

Bertuzzi&#x27;s playing style as a power forward resulted in comparisons to former Islander Clark Gillies. As a result, the club hired Gillies to personally mentor Bertuzzi. Failing to meet lofty expectations from the club, Gillies once said of Bertuzzi, &quot;If you&#x27;re built like a freight train, you can&#x27;t drive around like a Volkswagen.&quot; Feeling burdened with the pressure of playing up to the club&#x27;s expectations while his offensive production diminished, he requested to be traded away at one point during the 1996–97 season. In response, Milbury, who had also taken over general manager duties the previous season, demoted Bertuzzi to the Islanders&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). Playing 13 games in the minors, he registered 10 points before being called back up to the NHL. During the 1997–98 campaign, he continued to score below his pace as a rookie. On February 6, 1998, he was traded along with defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third-round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (Jarkko Ruutu) to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for veteran forward Trevor Linden. The deal was made prior to the NHL&#x27;s roster freeze in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Bertuzzi and McCabe had both been widely regarded as the players of the future for New York after their respective drafts in 1993. While Milbury expressed regret at having to trade McCabe, relations between Bertuzzi and the club were strained. Welcoming the trade, Bertuzzi commented that &quot;things weren&#x27;t working out [in New York].&quot;

===Vancouver Canucks (1998–2006)===
Bertuzzi immediately began producing with Vancouver, tallying 15 points in 22 games after the trade. Combined with his totals from New York, he finished with 33 points over 74 games in 1997–98. Contrasting his strained relationship with Milbury in New York, Canucks head coach Mike Keenan has recalled his experience with Bertuzzi upon his arrival as positive: &quot;He came as a young player and he was very open-minded about learning about the game.&quot; Similar to the Islanders, Bertuzzi joined a struggling club in Vancouver; the team finished last in the Western Conference in his first two seasons after the trade.

After beginning the 1998–99 season on the Canucks&#x27; top line, Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, the first of which was a fractured tibia. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate Mattias Öhlund hit him in the leg. His season was later ended with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999. He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a restricted free agent and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; to be worth a little over $2 million.

Returning from injury the following season, Bertuzzi emerged as one of the Canucks&#x27; best offensive contributors, finishing with 25 goals (second on the team to Markus Näslund) and 50 points in 1999–2000. At the end of the season, he received the team&#x27;s Most Exciting Player Award, as voted by the fans. He received the distinction three more times during his career with the Canucks from 2002 to 2004). Meanwhile, the Canucks began improving as a team, finishing four points out of a playoff spot in the West in 2000.

The following season, Bertuzzi recorded his first career NHL hat trick, recording all three goals on the power play against San Jose Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov in a 6–3 win on December 30, 2000. Bertuzzi recorded a second consecutive 25-goal season in 2000–01, adding 30 assists for 55 points, third in team scoring behind Näslund and Andrew Cassels. His -18 plus-minus rating, however, was a team-worst. The Canucks continued to improve, qualifying for the post-season for the first time in five years. Entering the 2001 playoffs as the final and eighth seed in the West, they were eliminated in the first round by the Colorado Avalanche. Bertuzzi scored two goals and two assists over four games in his first NHL post-season appearance. In the off-season, Bertuzzi filed for salary arbitration after initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Canucks. Both sides avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year deal on July 26, 2001.
In the first month of the 2001–02 season, Bertuzzi received an automatic 10-game suspension from the league (forfeiting $118,557 in salary) after leaving the bench to help teammate Ed Jovanovski in a fight. The incident occurred during a game against the Colorado Avalanche in which opposing coach Bob Hartley sent enforcer Scott Parker onto the ice as the extra attacker during a delayed penalty. Parker proceeded to physically engage Jovanovski, at which point Bertuzzi left the bench to help his teammate. Vancouver struggled with him out of the lineup, winning 3 games during the 10-game span. Two months after returning from suspension, Bertuzzi went 15 consecutive games with at least a point, scoring 7 goals and 12 assists from January 3 – February 4, 2002. The streak tied Petr Nedvěd for the longest in Canucks history. During that span, in a game on January 9, Canucks head coach Marc Crawford replaced Andrew Cassels with Brendan Morrison, marking the beginning of what was considered by many to be the most effective line combination in the league for several seasons. Bertuzzi had emerged as an effective power forward, able to use his size and strength to position himself in front of the net, with good stickhandling ability. According to Canucks assistant coach Jack McIlhargey, Bertuzzi&#x27;s skill set favourably complemented Näslund&#x27;s goal-scoring and Morrison&#x27;s playmaking abilities. The trio were dubbed by Vancouver media as the &quot;West Coast Express&quot;, named after the city&#x27;s commuter rail service of the same name.

Late in the 2001–02 season, Bertuzzi recorded his second career hat-trick on March 19, 2002, during a win against the New York Rangers. He scored his first two goals of the game against Dan Blackburn and his third into an empty net. Despite missing ten games from his suspension, Bertuzzi finished the 2001–02 season third in league-scoring with 85 points, behind Näslund and Calgary Flames forward Jarome Iginla. His 1.18 points-per-game average ranked second in the NHL behind Mario Lemieux, who played 48 fewer games than Bertuzzi. He also improved his plus-minus rating by 39 points from the previous season, finishing a career-high +21. Although the Canucks were the league&#x27;s highest scoring team, they finished with the final seed in the West for the 2002 playoffs, ranking eighth in their conference. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Bertuzzi recorded four points in the series.

The following season, Bertuzzi appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game. He was joined by fellow Canucks Markus Näslund, defenceman Ed Jovanovski and head coach Marc Crawford, helping the Western Conference to a 6–5 shootout win against the East. Bertuzzi played on an all-star line with Näslund and Colorado Avalanche centre Peter Forsberg. Later in the season, Bertuzzi scored his third career hat-trick on March 17, 2003, scoring three goals against Ron Tugnutt in a game against the Dallas Stars. He finished the season with career-highs of 46 goals (third in the league), 51 assists and 97 points (fifth in the league). His 25 power play goals led the NHL and tied Pavel Bure for the Canucks&#x27; single-season record. Linemates Näslund and Morrison also recorded personal bests with 104 and 71 points, respectively. Meanwhile, the Canucks emerged as a top team in the West. Losing the Northwest Division title to the Avalanche by one point in the regular season, they finished as the fourth seed in their conference. After going down three-games-to-one in the opening round against the St. Louis Blues, Vancouver won three straight games to advance to the second round. Facing the Minnesota Wild, the Canucks gave up their own three-games-to-one series lead and were eliminated in seven games. During the series, Bertuzzi had reportedly walked by the Xcel Energy Center box office and told Wild fans they would not need their Game 6 tickets because Minnesota would be eliminated by then. In another on-ice incident, he skated by the opposing bench during Game 7 when the Canucks were winning 2–0, telling Wild players to &quot;get [their] golf clubs&quot;. Despite his successful regular season, Bertuzzi struggled to score in the playoffs, recording 6 points in 14 games. In the off-season, Bertuzzi was named with Näslund to the NHL first All-Star team.
With Bertuzzi entering the final year of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi&#x27;s agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 million signing bonus ($2.5 million paid in the first year and $500,000 in the second). The deal paid him $4.3 million the first year, $6.633 million the second year and $6.933 million for the third and fourth years.

In January 2004, Bertuzzi was voted by league fans to the starting lineup of the NHL All-Star Game. Representing the Western Conference alongside Näslund and Canucks head coach Marc Crawford, they were defeated by the East 6–4. Bertuzzi had two assists while playing on an all-star line with Näslund and Colorado Avalanche centre Joe Sakic. Nearing the end of the 2003–04 season, Bertuzzi was indefinitely suspended by the NHL for punching Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind and driving his head into the ice during a game on March 8, 2004. His actions were a retaliation to a hit from Moore on Näslund during a previous game. Sitting out the remainder of the regular season and playoffs due to his suspension, he finished 2003–04 with 60 points over 69 games. Vancouver replaced Bertuzzi on the team&#x27;s top line with Matt Cooke and went on to their first Northwest Division title, before being eliminated in the first round of the 2004 playoffs by the Calgary Flames.

Inactive in 2004–05 due to the players lockout and his ongoing suspension, which had been extended internationally, Bertuzzi returned to the Canucks in 2005–06, as the league ended his playing ban. He recorded 25 goals and 71 points, including two hat tricks (November 13, 2005, against the Detroit Red Wings and January 14, 2006, against the New York Islanders). Though he ranked third in team scoring, Crawford has recalled that by the end of the season, Näslund and Bertuzzi had been eclipsed by Daniel and Henrik Sedin as the team&#x27;s offensive leaders.

There was speculation that the effects of the Steve Moore incident, which included assault charges and constant media coverage, were negatively affecting his play. While on the road, he was consistently heckled and booed by fans throughout the NHL. Näslund, a close friend of Bertuzzi&#x27;s, later expressed sympathy for him, saying in a 2008 interview, &quot;It still bothers me what Todd has had to go through...There&#x27;s no question he was standing up for me...it all went too far.&quot;

Beyond the negative impact on Bertuzzi&#x27;s individual play, the media speculated that the fallout from the Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed the playoffs for the first time in four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.

===Florida, Detroit, and Anaheim (2006–08)===
Instrumental in facilitating the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi&#x27;s positive relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, who was his first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which kept him out of the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was in the last year of his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.
Bertuzzi returned to action on March 22, 2007, debuting with his new team in a 2–1 shootout loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Eight days later, he scored his first goal as a Red Wing in a 4–3 shootout loss to the Dallas Stars. On April 7, he suffered a neck injury that kept him out of the lineup for the last game of the regular season and the first two games of the 2007 playoffs. He finished the campaign with 11 points in 15 games split between Florida and Detroit. During the playoffs, the Red Wings advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost in six games to the Anaheim Ducks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. Bertuzzi recorded 7 points in 16 playoff games.

Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Bertuzzi agreed to a two-year, $8 million contract with the Anaheim Ducks on July 2, 2007. Signing him was Ducks general manager Brian Burke, who had served as the Canucks general manager during Bertuzzi&#x27;s time in Vancouver. Bertuzzi had reportedly been in negotiations to re-sign with Detroit, but the club only wanted a one-year deal. Playing the Red Wings in the Ducks&#x27; first game of the regular season on October 3, 2007, he registered a goal and an assist in a 3–2 shootout loss. In the first month of the 2007–08 campaign, he suffered a concussion and was sidelined for 14 games in October and November 2007. Bertuzzi returned to the lineup in time for the Ducks&#x27; away game against the Canucks on November 27, which marked his first NHL game in Vancouver since being traded away. Bertuzzi was received warmly by Canucks fans, as the Ducks lost the game 4–0. Playing in 68 contests over the season, he registered 40 points with Anaheim. Entering the 2008 playoffs as the defending champions, the Ducks were eliminated in the first round four games to two by the Dallas Stars. In six playoff contests, Bertuzzi recorded two assists.

===Calgary Flames (2008–09)===
During the subsequent summer, several Ducks players were set to become free agents, including high-profile forward Corey Perry. Requiring additional salary cap space to make room for defenceman Scott Niedermayer, who announced he was returning for another season, Bertuzzi was placed on unconditional waivers with the intention of buying out the remaining year on his contract. Addressing Bertuzzi&#x27;s buy out with the media, Burke asserted that he &quot;believe[d] [Bertuzzi] can still play at the NHL level,&quot; and that the Ducks were merely &quot;handcuffed by [their] salary cap situation.&quot; Bertuzzi once again became an unrestricted free agent and signed a one-year, $1.95 million contract with the Calgary Flames on July 7, 2008. Joining Calgary, he was reunited with Flames coach Mike Keenan. Before the start of the 2008–09 season, Bertuzzi switched jersey numbers from 4 to 7, in honour of his boyhood idol, Phil Esposito. The numbers 44, which Bertuzzi wore in New York, Vancouver and Detroit, and 4, which he wore in Anaheim, were already taken in Calgary.

Bertuzzi scored his first goal with the Flames, deflecting a Dion Phaneuf shot, on October 11, 2008, in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Vancouver Canucks. While initial fan reaction to Bertuzzi was negative due to his previous role with the division-rival Canucks, as well as his reputation following the Steve Moore incident, he was eventually accepted in Calgary. In January 2009, he missed five games due to a back injury. Several months later, he was sidelined again with a knee injury and underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged cartilage on March 3, 2009. Missing 11 games, he returned in time for the 2009 playoffs, where the Flames were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the opening round. He finished his only season in Calgary with 44 points in 66 regular season games, while adding a goal and an assist in six playoff contests.

===Return to Detroit (2009–2014)===
On August 18, 2009, Bertuzzi re-joined the Red Wings by accepting a one-year contract with the club worth $1.5 million. He recorded 44 points (18 goals and 26 assists) in 2009–10, ranking fifth in team scoring. During the second round of the 2010 playoffs, Bertuzzi recorded a career-high five-point contest (a goal and four assists) in a Game 4 victory against the San Jose Sharks. Bertuzzi finished with a playoffs career-high 11 points in 12 games.

In the off-season, Bertuzzi signed a two-year, $3.875 million contract extension with the Red Wings on June 16, 2010. During the 2010–11 season, he appeared in his 1,000th NHL game on February 20, 2011, against the Minnesota Wild. Bertuzzi scored a shootout goal to help Detroit win the game 2–1. Dressing for 81 games that season, he ranked seventh in team scoring with 45 points (16 goals and 29 assists). During the 2011 playoffs, he added 6 points (2 goals and 4 assists) over 11 games as the Red Wings were eliminated in the second round by the San Jose Sharks.

On February 23, 2012, Bertuzzi re-signed with the Red Wings for $4.15 million over two years. He dressed for seven games in the lockout-shortened 2012-2013 regular season due to injuries, producing three points, and was held pointless over six games in the playoffs. In the 2013–2014 season he played 59 games and produced 16 points, but was a healthy scratch 15 times; he played one playoff game without a point.

During his time with Detroit, he earned praise from head coach Mike Babcock and teammates for adapting his playing style to be more defensively responsible. Bertuzzi credited the influence of teammates Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg, both successful two-way players in the league.

===Binghamton Senators tryout and retirement (2015)===
On January 9, 2015, he signed a professional tryout contract with the Ottawa Senators AHL affiliate the Binghamton Senators in hopes to get a contract with Ottawa.
Bertuzzi was released from his professional tryout offer with Binghamton on January 21, 2015, after posting no points and a minus-3 rating in his 2 games played with the Senators. He subsequently retired that year.

==International play==
Bertuzzi debuted internationally for Team Canada at the 1998 World Championships in Switzerland. He was among the youngest players selected to the team, along with Canucks teammate Bryan McCabe and Chicago Blackhawks forward Eric Dazé, who were all born in 1975 (third-string goaltender Christian Bronsard was two years younger, but did not play in any games). In six games, he recorded three points, as Canada failed to qualify for the medal rounds.

Two years later, Bertuzzi competed at the 2000 World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia. One of five Canucks players chosen to the national team, he was joined by Adrian Aucoin, Ed Jovanovski, Brendan Morrison and Peter Schaefer. His second tournament appearance was more productive, as he scored nine points in nine games – first among Canadian players and fourth overall – while also leading the tournament in penalty minutes with 47. Canada did not medal, losing to Finland in the bronze medal game by a 2–1 score. His 63 total penalty minutes from both tournament appearances set an all-time Canadian record for World Championship competitors since 1977 (when Canada resumed competing in the tournament).

In December 2005, Bertuzzi was controversially selected to play for Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. His inclusion, along with that of Dany Heatley and Shane Doan, was discussed at length by the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC). The committee had concerns stemming from the Steve Moore incident and Bertuzzi&#x27;s probationary status, but subsequently approved his representation of Canada at the Olympics. According to a Canadian Press article, &quot;[COC president] Chambers said the [unusual meeting] was prompted by some media concerns raised over the three athletes participating in the Games. The fact it took the committee so long to approve the list means there was some debate.&quot;

Bertuzzi went on to post three points (all assists) at the 2006 Olympics, tying for second in team scoring with nine other players. Canada failed to advance past the quarterfinal, losing to Russia by a 2–0 score. They finished in seventh place overall after winning gold at the previous Winter Olympics in 2002.

==Steve Moore incident==

On February 16, 2004, during a game between Vancouver and Colorado, Avalanche center Steve Moore checked Markus Näslund in the head, causing a minor concussion and a bone chip in his elbow. No penalty was assessed, and the league decided not to fine or suspend Moore, ruling the hit legal. Näslund missed three games as a result of the hit. In a rematch, with the Canucks trailing the Avalanche 8–2 in the third period, Bertuzzi began following Moore around the ice, attempting to provoke him into another fight. With Moore ignoring him, Bertuzzi grabbed Moore&#x27;s jersey from behind and punched him in the side of the face from behind. Moore&#x27;s face hit the ice as Bertuzzi pushed him, already out cold, and broke his neck. Bertuzzi, as well as several other players from both teams, landed atop Moore as he fell to the ice. Bertuzzi was assessed a match penalty and ejected from the game. Per league rules, he was also suspended indefinitely pending a ruling from league commissioner Gary Bettman.

After lying on the ice for approximately 10 minutes, Moore was removed from the playing surface on a stretcher. He was treated for three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves, and facial lacerations. He was also suffering from amnesia. Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the fans in a press conference two days later.

On March 11, 2004, the league ruled he would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks&#x27; season, which ultimately cost him the final 13 games of the regular season plus seven playoff games. The Canucks were additionally fined $250,000. While the following NHL season was suspended due to the 2004–05 lockout, Bertuzzi intended to play in Europe, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) extended his NHL suspension to cover their jurisdiction. Bertuzzi remained professionally inactive during the 2004–05 season. The IIHF&#x27;s sanction also kept him from representing Canada in the 2004 and 2005 World Championships, as well as the 2004 World Cup.

Bettman scheduled a reinstatement hearing for Bertuzzi on April 26, 2005. The hearing was attended separately by Bertuzzi and Moore. Prior to the 2005–06 season, Bettman announced Bertuzzi&#x27;s reinstatement on August 8, citing that &quot;Mr. Bertuzzi had paid a very significant price for his conduct,&quot; adding that he felt Bertuzzi was &quot;genuinely remorseful and apologetic.&quot; Bertuzzi&#x27;s 17-month suspension caused him to miss a total of 20 games—the fourth-longest suspension in NHL history at the time. The suspension accounted for $501,926.39 in forfeited salary, as well as an approximate $350,000 in lost endorsements. On the day of his reinstatement, Team Canada&#x27;s executive director, Wayne Gretzky, offered him a spot on the national team&#x27;s summer orientation camp in preparation for the 2006 Winter Olympics.

===Legal actions===
After a four-month investigation, the criminal justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 hours of community service and one year&#x27;s probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi&#x27;s successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi&#x27;s discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore&#x27;s lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day&#x27;s notice of the court date following Bertuzzi&#x27;s plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.

On February 17, 2005, Moore filed a lawsuit in a Colorado court against Bertuzzi, numerous individuals within the Canucks organization, including Brad May (Bertuzzi&#x27;s teammate at the time who was quoted as saying that there would &quot;definitely be a price on Moore&#x27;s head&quot; after Moore&#x27;s hit on Näslund), Brian Burke, Marc Crawford, as well as the Canucks organization as a whole and the Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment company that owned the team. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2005, as the Colorado judge ruled the case was better suited for Canadian courts, as Moore and all the defendants were Canadian citizens. Planning to appeal the decision, Danson stated publicly the following month that Moore had begun skating and doing regular workouts, but continued to suffer concussion-related symptoms.

On February 16, 2006, Moore filed another lawsuit in the Ontario Superior Court against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and Orca Bay, seeking CAD$15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, CAD$1 million for aggravated damages, and CAD$2 million for punitive damages. Moore&#x27;s parents, who were watching their son on television when the attack happened, also sued, seeking CAD$1.5 million for &quot;negligent infliction of nervous shock and mental distress&quot;. In December 2006, Bettman and top lieutenant Bill Daly facilitated a meeting between Moore&#x27;s representatives and the defendants in hopes of agreeing on an out-of-court settlement. An out-of-court settlement was reached in Moore&#x27;s lawsuit in October 2014. Terms of the settlement are confidential.

==Personal life==
Bertuzzi was born and raised in Sudbury, Ontario. His father, Albert Bertuzzi, is an Italian-Canadian who worked in the window-washing business. When Bertuzzi was a teenager, Albert survived a near-fatal car accident in which he was thrown from the vehicle through the windshield. His father has stated that he was proud of his own local reputation as a &quot;dirty player&quot; and referred to it as a &quot;Bertuzzi trait&quot;. He has said that Bertuzzi takes after him in regards to his toughness and aggression. Bertuzzi&#x27;s great-uncle, Larry Bertuzzi, is a Toronto-based lawyer who has done arbitration work for the NHL, including on the Eric Lindros trade.

Growing up, Bertuzzi played minor hockey with the Nickel Centre and Sudbury Minor Hockey programs. In 1990–91, Bertuzzi played as an underaged player in the major midget ranks with the Sudbury Capitals AAA team. Physically built as a power forward throughout his youth, he stood 6 feet and 2 inches (1.88 metres) and weighed 195 pounds (88.5 kilograms) by age 15.

Bertuzzi and his wife, Julie, were married in July 1996. They have two children born years apart in Vancouver, a son named Tag and a daughter named Jaden. His son, Tag Bertuzzi, was invited to the Florida Panthers development roster in 2022, and was drafted into the OHL by the Guelph Storm, 2nd overall in 2017. Bertuzzi is a recreational golfer and has credited the sport with allowing him to relax more as a hockey player. During his 10-game suspension from the NHL in October and November 2001, he played golf to focus his energy. Afterwards, he made it a custom to go to the driving range before every game.

Bertuzzi&#x27;s nephew Tyler Bertuzzi plays in the NHL.

<doc id="440393" wikidata="Q795013" url="?curid=440393" title="Bill Guerin">
<text>William Robert Guerin (born November 9, 1970) is an American former professional ice hockey player and the current general manager of the Minnesota Wild. He previously was the assistant general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins and general manager of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.

Guerin played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), winning two Stanley Cup championships with the New Jersey Devils and Pittsburgh Penguins.

Internationally, Guerin represented the United States in the Olympics in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and participated in two Ice Hockey World Championships. Guerin is the first player of Hispanic descent to play in the NHL.

==Playing career==

===Professional===

Guerin was drafted in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft fifth overall by the New Jersey Devils and played with the team from 1991 to 1998, winning the Stanley Cup in 1995. Midway through the 1997–98 season, Guerin was traded (along with Valeri Zelepukin) to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Jason Arnott and Bryan Muir.

In November 2001 Guerin was traded to his hometown team, the Boston Bruins.

After a 41-goal season in 2001–02, Guerin left the Bruins as a free agent and signed a five-year contract with the Dallas Stars. He performed below expectations during his tenure with the Stars. After a disappointing season in 2005–06 in which he recorded just 40 points, Dallas opted to buy-out the remainder of his contract. The conditions of buyouts in the NHL meant that the Stars would have to pay him two-thirds of the remaining salary on his contract spread out over twice as many years; this meant $6.7 million over one year became $4.4 million over two years.

On July 3, 2006, Guerin signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the St. Louis Blues. Playing on a line with former Oiler teammate Doug Weight, Guerin revived his career, easily eclipsing his disappointing goal-scoring mark from the 2005–06 season. He was named to the 2007 All-Star Game (hosted by the Stars) to represent the Blues. Despite numerous criticisms of his play during his time as a Star, Guerin received a standing ovation from the Dallas fans in recognition as his status as a longtime fan favorite.

On February 2, 2007, Guerin became the 214th NHL player to play in 1,000 games. Later that month, he was traded to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Ville Nieminen, prospect Jay Barriball and a conditional first-round pick (either New Jersey&#x27;s in 2007 or San Jose&#x27;s in 2008). During the subsequent off-season, Guerin signed a two-year contract with the New York Islanders. On July 9, 2007, he was named captain of the Islanders, making him the 11th captain in team history.
On March 4, 2009, Guerin was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a conditional draft pick. The pick, a 2009 fourth-round pick if the Penguins made the playoffs, was later turned into a 2009 third-round pick once the Penguins advanced to the second round of the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs. Guerin won the Stanley Cup on June 12, 2009, with the Penguins, defeating the Detroit Red Wings by a final score of 2–1 for Game 7 at Joe Louis Arena. His 14 years between Stanley Cups as a player was the third-longest wait in NHL history, behind Chris Chelios (16) and Mark Recchi (15).

After vocal encouragement for his return from the crowd and teammates at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Stanley Cup parade on June 15, as well as expressing his own affection for the city and team, Guerin signed a one-year contract extension with the Penguins on June 29 at a greatly reduced salary to play through the 2009–10 season. He became the first player to have a 20-goal season with seven different teams and one of only three to have a 20-goal season with five or more different teams (the two others being Eddie Shack and Ray Sheppard). Ray Shero, the general manager for the Penguins opted not to offer Guerin a contract for the 2010–11 season. On September 7, 2010, the Philadelphia Flyers invited Guerin to try out at training camp, but on October 4, the Flyers released him prior to the start of the regular season.

On December 6, 2010, Guerin announced his retirement as a player from the NHL as a Pittsburgh Penguin. At the time of his retirement, Guerin ranked seventh all-time among Americans in the NHL with 429 goals.

==Management career==
On June 6, 2011, the Penguins hired Guerin as their player development coach. On June 6, 2014, Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford announced that Guerin would be promoted to assistant general manager of the team. Rutherford said that Guerin would be focusing on developing the analytical side of the game. Following consecutive Stanley Cup triumphs in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins announced that Guerin&#x27;s duties would expand to include the role of general manager of their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, made vacant via the departure of Jason Botterill to the NHL&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres.

On August 21, 2019, Guerin was named the fourth general manager of the Minnesota Wild.
On March 21, 2022, Guerin was named the TSN TradeCentre GM of the Day, for his transactions at the 2022 NHL Trade Deadline.

== Controversies ==

===Sexual assault coverup allegation===
In a lawsuit filed on November 3, 2020, in Pennsylvania, it was alleged that Guerin played a role in covering up an alleged sexual assault on the wife of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins assistant coach Jarrod Skalde by the team&#x27;s head coach Clark Donatelli. The lawsuit, &quot;Skalde et al. v. Lemieux Group, L.P. et al.&quot;, alleges that Guerin, then the general manager of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, &quot;told Skalde to keep quiet about the alleged assault.&quot; Guerin denied any wrongdoing on his part, claiming that he had &quot;promptly brought (the allegation) to Pittsburgh Penguins senior management&quot;. The lawsuit was settled in November 2021. An internal investigation by the NHL confirmed that he had reported the incident promptly and cleared him of wrongdoing.

The United States Center for SafeSport opened an investigation on Guerin over his alleged role in the whistleblower lawsuit. As of April 2022, the organization had not yet released its findings, nor confirmed whether the investigation remained ongoing.

=== Verbal Abuse Investigation ===
In December 2023, the Wild conducted an investigation after an employee filed a verbal abuse complaint against Guerin to human resources. Guerin retained his position, no sanctions were announced, and the Wild refused to comment.

==Personal life==
Guerin was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and raised in Wilbraham, Massachusetts. He attended Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy, and played junior hockey for the Springfield Olympics in lieu of high school hockey. Guerin is of Nicaraguan and Irish descent.

Guerin and his wife Kara have four children and reside in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. They previously lived in Morristown, New Jersey during his tenure with the Devils.

<text>Michael Thomas Modano Jr. (; born June 7, 1970) is an American former professional ice hockey player. He played as a center and spent most of his career with the Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars franchise. He spent the final season of his career with his hometown Detroit Red Wings.

As the all-time goal-scoring and points leader amongst American-born players in NHL history, Modano is widely regarded as one of the greatest American-born ice hockey players of all time. He was drafted first overall by the North Stars in 1988, and after the team moved to Texas he helped the Stars win the Stanley Cup in 1999.

Modano is considered one of the most influential figures in popularizing ice hockey in Texas and the southern United States. Modano was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 17, 2014. In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players. In 2019, he was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Modano was born in Livonia, Michigan, the third child and only son of Michael, Sr. and Karen Modano. He grew up in Highland Township, and due to causing problems at school with his mischievous behavior, a friend of his father suggested to put Modano in a team sport to get him controlled. Michael, Sr. was a fan of hockey, and decided to teach ice skating to seven-year-old Modano. He learned it well, and six months later was put in local hockey teams. As a youth, he was part of a Detroit Red Wings team in the 1982 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament. To spend his minor hockey career with the Detroit Little Caesar&#x27;s Triple AAA Hockey Club, the Modano family moved to Westland, where he also attended Franklin High School (Livonia, Michigan). He made the Midget Major team at the age of fourteen when his teammates were two to three years older. In the 1984–85 season, Modano scored 50 goals and 50 assists on the way to win the USA Hockey National Championship in 1985. As a child Modano decided to pick the number 9 for his jersey in an homage to both Ted Williams, an idol of his Boston Red Sox fan father, and the Red Wings&#x27; own Gordie Howe.

==Playing career==

===Minor leagues (1986–1988)===
In 1986, 16-year-old Modano was invited by coach Rick Wilson of the Prince Albert Raiders to come to Saskatchewan and join the Western Hockey League team. At his very first game, he scored a hat trick, and by his second year, Modano was part of the WHL All-Star Team. Four days after Modano&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, the Minnesota North Stars selected him as the first overall draft pick in the 1988 NHL entry draft. Modano was the second American to be selected first overall in the draft, after Brian Lawton in 1983. Contract problems led Modano to play one more season with the Raiders.

===Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars (1988–2010)===
The North Stars signed Modano on Christmas of 1988, and he joined the team for the 1989–90 season. He scored his first career NHL goal against Glenn Healy of the New York Islanders, and had a good rookie season which landed him on the NHL All-Rookie team and made him a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy. He controversially lost to 31-year-old Sergei Makarov, who had already played professionally in the Soviet Championship League for over 12 years; this led to an age barrier of 26 for Calder candidates from the following year to the present.

Despite the good start, Modano was often criticized in Minnesota as an underachiever. This was evidenced by a sophomore season where the North Stars reached the Stanley Cup Finals, but Modano&#x27;s point production dropped, while confronting coach Bob Gainey for his overtly defensive style. In 1992, Modano signed a four-year extension that made him the highest-paid member of the team, receiving $2 million per year. He soon had his best season up to that point, scoring 93 points at the 1992–93 NHL season and earning his first NHL All-Star Game invitation.

====Stars move to Dallas====
Prior to the 1993–94 NHL season, the North Stars moved to Dallas to become the Dallas Stars. Considering the relocation to Texas as an opportunity for a fresh start, with different expectations from fans and the media, Modano decided to accept Gainey&#x27;s suggestions to become a more complete player and perform more attacks. Modano recorded a personal-best 50 goals and again scored 93 points. Soon he became an idol in Dallas, becoming the player who sold the most jerseys and received the most letters. During the next two seasons, Modano lowered his goalscoring and had many injuries – a concussion, a knee injury and ruptured ankle tendons – but improved his defensive play. Despite that, the Stars failed to qualify for the 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs, and Gainey stepped down as head coach, while remaining GM.

Ken Hitchcock was hired on January 8, 1996, as Dallas&#x27; coach, installing a defensive-minded system while requesting Modano to concentrate on his offense and using him more routinely – instead of the 15–18 minutes he played under Gainey, Modano routinely played 25 minutes with Hitchcock. Helped by new acquisitions Joe Nieuwendyk and Sergei Zubov, Modano led the Stars to the Central Division title in the 1996–97 season. In the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs, with new goaltender Ed Belfour, the Stars reached the Western Conference finals. However, they fell in six games at the hands of the eventual back-to-back Stanley Cup champions, the Detroit Red Wings.

In 1999, Modano won the Stanley Cup with the Stars, playing all six games of the finals against the Buffalo Sabres despite breaking his wrist in the second game. Modano assisted on the Stars&#x27; final five goals of the series, including both in Game 5 and Game 6, and final goal. He led the Stars with 23 points in the playoffs, with all seven in the finals on assists. The Stars returned to the finals in 2000 against the New Jersey Devils. Modano scored the overtime goal that gave the Stars a victory in game 5, but in Game 6 in Dallas, the Devils wound up closing the series 4–2.

Modano averaged 78 points per season from 1996 to 2002, and was also one of the NHL&#x27;s top forwards in plus/minus over that span (his +43 in 1997 was second only to John LeClair&#x27;s +44 mark). Modano&#x27;s career high for points in a game is six (2–4–6) against the Anaheim Ducks, and he has seven career hat tricks. His only career fight was against Rod Brind&#x27;Amour. He was also a candidate for the Frank J. Selke Trophy (2001), and the Lady Byng Trophy (2003).

====2005–2010====
As the long-time face of the Dallas franchise, he has recorded over 1,000 NHL points and became the captain of the Stars in 2003. During the 2005 offseason, Modano contemplated signing with the Boston Bruins, but he decided to stay with the Stars after owner Tom Hicks got involved. Modano would sign a five-year contract extension with Dallas on August 5, 2005. On September 29, 2006, Brenden Morrow replaced him as the Stars&#x27; captain; Modano served an alternate captain from that time until 2010, a role in which he had previously served from 1995 to 2003.

Modano scored his 500th career regular-season goal on March 13, 2007, with 10:24 left in the 3rd period in a regulation win against Antero Niittymäki of the Philadelphia Flyers with assists by Antti Miettinen and Jon Klemm. He is only the 14th goal scorer to score 500 goals with a single team and the 39th player to reach 500 goals overall.
On March 17, 2007, in an away game versus the Nashville Predators, Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd career regular-season goals in a 3–2 loss, thus passing Joe Mullen&#x27;s NHL record (502) for most goals scored by an American-born player.

Modano also holds the NHL all-time record for most points scored by a U.S.-born player. He broke the record, which previously belonged to Phil Housley, on November 7, 2007, by scoring two goals in the first five minutes, with the record-breaker being a short-handed goal on a breakaway, against the San Jose Sharks. That night, amongst his congratulatory phone calls was one from Air Force One, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to him for a few minutes about the record.

The Stars&#x27; game on November 21, 2007, was named &quot;Mike Modano Tribute Night&quot; at American Airlines Center, where Modano was honored by the franchise for his achievements in U.S. hockey. Those who spoke in the pre-game ceremony included Brett Hull, Joe Mullen, Phil Housley, and Stars owner Tom Hicks. Capping off an emotional night, Modano later went on to score the game-tying goal, as well as a shootout goal in a 3–2 Stars victory against the Anaheim Ducks.

With his production declining from 2007 to 2010, Modano played out the duration of his contract, which expired after the 2009–10 season. In the final game of that season (coincidentally played in Minnesota, where Modano began his pro career), Modano was saluted with a video tribute and a standing ovation, and named the game&#x27;s first star, skating around the ice wearing a Minnesota North Stars jersey.

===Detroit Red Wings (2010–2011)===

On June 29, 2010, the Stars announced that Modano would not be re-signed to a contract for the 2010–11 season. After contemplating retirement or signing with the Detroit Red Wings (in his home state) or with the Minnesota Wild (in the state where he began his NHL career), Modano signed a one-year contract with the Red Wings. As the no. 9 jersey had been retired by the Red Wings, Modano went for no. 90 instead. Coach Mike Babcock expressed a desire for Modano to center Detroit&#x27;s third line with Dan Cleary and Jiří Hudler.

At 5:35 of the first period of Detroit&#x27;s 2010–11 home opener, on just his second shift, Modano took a pass from Cleary and beat Anaheim goaltender Jonas Hiller for his first goal as a Red Wing.

Modano&#x27;s time with the Red Wings ended on a sour note when Babcock made him a healthy scratch for his potential 1,500th regular-season game in the NHL. Modano finished his career with 1,499 regular-season games played.

==Post-playing career==
On September 23, 2011, after 21 seasons in the NHL, Modano officially announced his retirement from hockey at a press conference in Dallas. Modano was the last active player to have played in the 1980s, along with Mark Recchi, as well as the last active player to have played for the Minnesota North Stars. The Stars signed Modano to a one-day contract to allow Modano to retire as a Dallas Star. In January 2013, Modano became an alternate governor and executive advisor for the Stars&#x27; office. He described his role as regarding the &quot;business side of the organization&quot;, attracting the involvement of local businesses to the team, as well as getting more fans to Stars games.

In May 2019, Modano was hired by the Minnesota Wild to serve as an executive advisor in the front office.

Modano is the founder and current Vice President of the Mike Modano Foundation, Inc., which raises awareness and funding for organizations offering education and assistance to children and families affected by child abuse, acts with canine rescue and has also united with the Wounded Warrior Project. Moreover, since the start of his NHL career, Modano has affiliated many times with both charitable organizations and the Texas community in general. He has also had his own clothing line during the 1990s.

Modano was one of a number of sportsmen to feature in a series of vignettes for WWF superstar Mr. Perfect, with Perfect playing as a goaltender saving every shot including Modano&#x27;s.

Modano made a brief cameo appearance alongside then-teammate Basil McRae in the 1992 film &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;. Modano received a membership voucher to the Screen Actors Guild for the role.

Modano is an avid golfer, having met his second wife on a golf course, and playing in some tournaments after retirement. On Mike Modano Tribute Night, both the Dallas Stars and Anaheim Ducks organizations presented him with golf packages, one of which was for the course at The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland. His golf partner is often former Stars teammate Brett Hull. In the 2nd round of the 2021 American Century Celebrity Golf Championship on the 18th hole, Modano hit a double eagle (albatross) for the first time in the history of the event. The result of his shot going in gave him a tie for lead with John Smoltz going into the 3rd and final round.

Hull and Modano ran a Dallas restaurant, Hully &amp; Mo Restaurant and Tap Room, from 2008 to 2012. In 2003, the town of Westland, where Modano lived during his minor hockey career and his parents still reside, renamed their ice rink as Mike Modano Ice Arena.

==Legacy==

Modano holds numerous records and accolades in NHL history, such as goals by a player born in the United States with 561, points by an American-born player with 1374, career playoff points by an American-born player with 146, and games played by an American-born forward with 1499. These achievements and others lead to many peers and sportswriters regarding Modano as one of the greatest American-born ice hockey players of all time.

During his playing career, he was known for his speed, offensive instincts, scoring, puck-handling, and skating ability on the ice amongst peers, and regarded for his well-rounded style of play and skillset.

On January 21, 2007, the NHL announced Modano as the Special Ambassador to the 2007 NHL All-Star Celebration, thanks to his numerous contributions towards bringing the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game to Dallas and also for his contributions to Dallas hockey as a whole. Modano, the Stars&#x27; all-time leader in several statistical categories and a member of the franchise for the entirety of his 17-year career, appeared at selected All-Star events and dropped the puck in a ceremonial face-off prior the game on January 24, 2007.
On March 8, 2014, the Dallas Stars retired Modano&#x27;s #9 jersey. At that time he was only the 4th player in franchise history to have that honor.

On November 17, 2014, Modano was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

For the 100th anniversary of the NHL in January 2017, Modano was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players, voted in by a panel of 58 people, including media members, NHL alumni and NHL executives.

In February 2019, Modano was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.

In December 2022, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Modano at #51 on its &quot;NHL99&quot; list of the 100 best players in modern NHL history.

The Dallas Stars unveiled a statue of Mike Modano at the American Airlines Center on March 16, 2024. The statue honoring Modano, designed by Omri Amrany, is located in the PNC Plaza outside of the arena, alongside one of Dallas Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki.

==Personal life==

During his tenure with the Stars, Modano started dating Kerri Nelson, sister of his teammates Jeff and Todd Nelson. In October 1999, he proposed to her, but eventually they ended the engagement in February 2000.
On November 30, 2006, singer/songwriter Willa Ford announced that Modano, her long-time boyfriend, had proposed to her during the weekend of Thanksgiving, 2006. Modano and Ford were married in a small ceremony in Athens, Texas, on August 25, 2007, where Brett Hull and Darryl Sydor attended as Modano&#x27;s co-best men. Ford was asked by the NHL to blog the Stars&#x27; 2007 playoff series; her posts were well-received, and her support of her husband quite vocal. In August 2012, Ford and Modano announced that they were divorcing.

Modano married professional golfer Allison Micheletti, daughter and niece of former NHL players Joe Micheletti and Pat Micheletti, respectively, on September 1, 2013. They have twins (Jack and Kate), born in 2014 as well as a daughter, Reese (born 2016), son, Luca (born 2018), and daughter, Quinn (born 2020).

<text>Roberto Luongo (, , ; born April 4, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers, and Vancouver Canucks. In 2022, Luongo was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Luongo is a two-time NHL All-Star (2004 and 2007) and winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals against average in the league (2011, with backup Cory Schneider). He was a finalist for several awards, including the Vezina Trophy as the league&#x27;s best goaltender (2004, 2007, and 2011), the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by his peers (2004 and 2007), and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player (2007). Luongo is second all time in games played as an NHL goaltender (1,044) and fourth all time in wins (489). He employed the butterfly style of goaltending.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, Luongo is of Italian and Irish ancestry. Prior to his NHL career, he played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs and the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, winning back-to-back President&#x27;s Cups and establishing the league&#x27;s all-time playoff records for games played and wins. Following his second QMJHL season, Luongo was selected fourth overall by the Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. After splitting his professional rookie season between the Islanders and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1999–2000, he was traded to the Panthers. In five seasons with Florida, Luongo established team records for games played, wins, and shutouts; despite several strong seasons, however, the Panthers remained a weak team and were unable to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs during Luongo&#x27;s initial stint with the team. During the 2006 offseason, he was traded to the Canucks after failed contract negotiations with the Panthers.

In his first season in Vancouver, Luongo won 47 games, and was runner-up for both the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and Vezina Trophy (best goaltender). Following his second year with the Canucks, he became the first NHL goaltender to serve as a team captain since Bill Durnan in the 1947–48 season. Luongo served in that capacity for two seasons before resigning from the position in September 2010. In the subsequent 2010–11 season, he helped the Canucks to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals but lost to the Boston Bruins. During his eight-year tenure with Vancouver, Luongo became the team&#x27;s all-time leader in wins and shutouts. He returned to the Panthers during the 2013–14 season, where he spent the remainder of his career, qualifying for the playoffs with the Panthers only once during that time. He was the last active goaltender to have played in the NHL in the 1990s. Following his playing career, Luongo joined the Panthers&#x27; front office as an executive, ultimately winning his first Stanley Cup in 2024.

Internationally, Luongo has competed for Team Canada in numerous tournaments. As a junior, he won a silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships, while being named Best Goaltender in his second tournament appearance. Luongo won two gold medals at the 2003 and 2004 World Championships and a silver in the 2005 World Championships. He also won the 2004 World Cup championship and appeared in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin as a backup to Martin Brodeur in both instances. He succeeded Brodeur as Canada&#x27;s starting goaltender during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, winning a gold medal. On January 7, 2014, he was named to the 2014 Canadian Olympic hockey team, where he won his second Olympic gold medal in a largely backup role to Carey Price.

==Early life==
Luongo was born to Pasqualina and Antonio Luongo in Montreal, Quebec. His father is an Italian immigrant, born in Santa Paolina, Avellino. He worked in the construction and delivery of furniture, while Luongo&#x27;s mother, an Irish-Canadian, worked in marketing with Air Canada. Antonio and Pasqualina married in Montreal after Antonio immigrated there in 1976.

Luongo has two younger brothers, Leo and Fabio, who also aspired to be goaltenders. Fabio progressed the further of the two, playing Junior A in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) with the Williams Lake Timberwolves in 2004–05 before injuries ended his career. He has since become a Junior AAA coach, while Leo is a goaltending coach with HC Lugano. Luongo and his family lived in Saint-Leonard, Quebec, a borough north of Montreal with a strong Italian community, just four blocks away from Martin Brodeur, who became the goaltender for the New Jersey Devils six years before Luongo entered the NHL. Luongo is fluent in English, French and Italian. His father spoke Italian and his mother spoke English with a little French at home.

Luongo graduated from Montreal Francophone high school Antoine de St-Exupéry in 1996. He began playing organized hockey at the age of eight as a forward. His father taught all his sons soccer and Luongo played until he was 14, at which point he decided to concentrate on hockey. Although he initially had the desire to play in net, his parents wanted him to develop his skating first. Several years later, after Luongo was cut from a peewee team, he made the switch to goaltender. At 11 years old, his team&#x27;s usual goaltender did not show up and after begging his mother, still hesitant about Luongo playing the position, he went in net and posted a shutout. In August 2009, the arena in which Luongo played his minor hockey in St. Leonard was named after him as the Roberto Luongo Arena. It is the second arena in the community to be named after an NHL goaltender after the Martin Brodeur Arena was renamed as such in 2000.

By 15, Luongo was playing midget with Montreal-Bourassa, the same team that produced NHL Quebecer goaltenders Brodeur and Félix Potvin. Luongo has credited Hall of Fame goaltender Grant Fuhr as his inspiration growing up, citing an admiration for his &quot;spectacular glove saves&quot;. He had the opportunity to first meet Fuhr before a game against the Calgary Flames during his rookie season with the Islanders.

==Playing career==

===Junior career (1995–1999)===
The Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs made Luongo the highest-drafted goaltender in Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) history, at second overall, in 1995. He began his junior career in the 1995–96 season with Val-d&#x27;Or and posted six wins in 23 games played. As the team&#x27;s starting goaltender the following season in 1996–97, he improved to a team-record 32 wins, and was awarded the Mike Bossy Trophy as the league&#x27;s best professional prospect. After his performance at the 1997 CHL Top Prospects Game, opposing coach Don Cherry likened Luongo to Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Hockey Hall of Famer Ken Dryden, while NHL Central Scouting Bureau director Frank Bonello heralded him as a &quot;franchise goaltender&quot;.

At the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, Luongo was selected in the first round, fourth overall, by the New York Islanders. The pick originally belonged to the Toronto Maple Leafs but was traded to the Islanders in exchange for Wendel Clark, Mathieu Schneider and D. J. Smith. At the time of the draft, Luongo was the highest-picked goaltender in NHL history, surpassing Tom Barrasso, John Davidson, and Ray Martynuik&#x27;s fifth overall selections in 1983, 1973, and 1970 (Luongo&#x27;s selection was later surpassed by Rick DiPietro&#x27;s first overall selection by the Islanders in 2000).

Upon his draft, Luongo continued to play junior with the Foreurs in 1997–98. He recorded 27 wins and a 3.09 goals against average (GAA). His seven shutouts tied Nick Sanza&#x27;s QMJHL record, set in 1974–75 (Adam Russo later tied it as well in 2002–03).

Although the Islanders planned to have Luongo play in the NHL for the 1998–99 season, an inconsistent performance at training camp led to Luongo&#x27;s return to the QMJHL that season. Owing to having failed to come to terms on a contract before October 1, 1998, Luongo was not allowed to be called up to the Islanders from junior over the course of the subsequent season. He started the season with Val-d&#x27;Or but was traded to the Acadie-Bathurst Titan during the 1999 World Junior Championships for the remainder of the 1998–99 season. He went on to lead the Titan to his second consecutive President&#x27;s Cup championship with a 2.74 GAA in 23 games. He finished his QMJHL playoff career with the all-time league record in games played (56), minutes played (3,264:22), wins (38) and shots faced (1,808).

===New York Islanders (1999–2000)===
After his performance at the 1999 World Junior Championships, Luongo was signed by the Islanders to a three-year, $2.775 million contract on January 8, 1999. The following season, he made his professional debut with the Lowell Lock Monsters, the Islanders&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. Early in the season, Luongo was called up to the Islanders on November 22, 1999, after a shoulder injury to back up Wade Flaherty. He made his NHL debut six days later on November 28, stopping 43 shots in a 2–1 win against the Boston Bruins. Luongo&#x27;s early performances solidified him as the Islanders&#x27; starting goaltender over veteran Félix Potvin. Nearly a month after Luongo&#x27;s debut in New York, Potvin was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on December 19 in exchange for backup goaltender Kevin Weekes. The next month, he recorded his first career NHL shutout in his eighth game, stopping 34 shots in a 3–0 victory over the Bruins on December 27.

In January 2000, Luongo was publicly criticized by Islanders general manager Mike Milbury for having gone looking for an apartment in New York on a game day before letting in seven goals to the Boston Bruins. Milbury told the media, &quot;You can&#x27;t do that in the NHL. You have to prepare yourself.&quot; Luongo defended himself by saying he did not divert from his usual game day routine by looking at just one apartment.

In the off-season, the Islanders selected goaltender Rick DiPietro with the first overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. DiPietro&#x27;s selection supplanted Luongo as the highest-drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders&#x27; goaltender of the future. Consequently, Milbury traded Luongo to the Florida Panthers along with centre Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and centre Oleg Kvasha that same day on June 24, 2000. The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players, in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha. Later in his career, Luongo expressed surprise at the trade, saying that before the Islanders drafted DiPietro, he had believed the team was preparing to make him its starting goaltender for the upcoming season.

===Florida Panthers (2000–2006)===

The Panthers&#x27; organization expressed high praise for Luongo following the trade. General manager Bryan Murray characterized him as &quot;a franchise guy&quot;, while head coach Terry Murray added &quot;He&#x27;s the guy teams have to have to win the Stanley Cup.&quot; He entered his first training camp with the Panthers competing for the starting role with veteran goaltender Trevor Kidd; coach Terry Murray opted to begin the season with Kidd owing to his experience. Luongo made his first start with the Panthers on October 9, 2000, making 18 saves in a 4–2 loss to the Boston Bruins. When splitting the goaltending duties, Luongo went on to appear in 43 games, in comparison to Kidd&#x27;s 42. He finished his 2000–01 rookie season (Luongo qualified as a rookie because he had not played in at least 26 games the previous season with New York) by notching a franchise record fifth shutout of the season in a 3–0 win against the New York Rangers on April 7, 2001. The total surpassed John Vanbiesbrouck&#x27;s four-shutout mark, set in both the 1994–95 and 1997–98 seasons. He posted a 12–24–7 record with the struggling Panthers, who finished 12th in the Eastern Conference, while recording a 2.44 GAA. His .920 save percentage was sixth in the league and second all-time among rookie goaltenders, behind Manny Fernandez&#x27;s mark set the previous season.

Approaching his third NHL season, Luongo agreed on a four-year contract extension with the Panthers on September 13, 2001. He was chosen to play in the inaugural NHL YoungStars Game in 2002 for Team Melrose, winning 13–7 over Team Fox. After appearing in 58 games in 2001–02, Luongo suffered a torn ligament in his right ankle in a game against the Montreal Canadiens on March 20, 2002. Sidelined for the remainder of the season, he finished with a 16–33–4 record, a 2.77 GAA and .915 save percentage. Luongo returned in 2002–03 to a heavier workload, playing a 65-game season. He had a franchise record-setting shutout streak that lasted 144:51 minutes; it was snapped on January 20, 2003, against the Montreal Canadiens.

In his fourth season with the Panthers (2003–04), Luongo emerged with his first Vezina Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award nominations as the top goaltender and top player as selected by the players, respectively. Playing in 72 games, he set NHL marks for most saves and shots faced in a single season with 2,303 and 2,475, respectively. Both marks were previously set by former Islanders teammate Félix Potvin in 1996–97 as a Toronto Maple Leaf. His resulting .931 save percentage was first among those goaltenders with at least 50 starts, and set a Panthers franchise record, breaking Vanbiesbrouck&#x27;s .924 mark, set in 1993–94. His seven shutouts furthered his franchise record and was good enough for fifth in the league. At mid-season, he was named to his first NHL All-Star Game, held in February 2004. Competing for the Eastern Conference, he won the Goaltenders Competition segment of the SuperSkills Competition, allowing the fewest goals on goaltender-related events. The following day, he played in the third period of the All-Star Game and helped the East to a 6–4 win against the West. At the end of the season, he was named to the second NHL All-Star team, but lost the Vezina Trophy to fellow Montreal-native Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils, while Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning won the Pearson Award.

Owing to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Luongo was inactive, with the exception of two international tournaments, the 2004 World Cup and the 2005 World Championships. With the NHL set to resume in 2005–06, Luongo was without a contract. After negotiations failed, the Panthers filed for arbitration on August 11, 2005. The process awarded Luongo a one-year, $3.2 million contract on August 25.

On April 13, 2006, Luongo became the most-wins Panthers goaltender of all time, passing Vanbiesbrouck, with his 107th win with the team – a 5–4 overtime victory against the Ottawa Senators. He went on to post 35 wins, breaking Vanbiesbrouck&#x27;s 27-win single-season Panthers mark, set in 1996–97. Set to become a free agent for the second consecutive off-season, he could not come to an agreement with the Panthers, having formally turned down a five-year, $30 million contract offer in January 2006. It was also reported that among Luongo&#x27;s demands were that backup goaltender Jamie McLennan be re-signed, his long-time goaltending coach François Allaire be hired and that a public statement be released that he would not be traded until the no-trade clause of his contract took effect.

===Vancouver Canucks (2006–2014)===
Prior to the start of the 2006–07 season, Panthers general manager Mike Keenan traded Luongo to the Vancouver Canucks on June 23, 2006. He was packaged with defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth round draft pick (Sergei Shirokov) in exchange for forward Todd Bertuzzi, defenceman Bryan Allen and goaltender Alex Auld. Immediately following the deal, Vancouver signed Luongo to a four-year, $27 million deal. He expressed surprise, claiming that he and the Panthers were very close to a deal the day before the trade.
Luongo&#x27;s arrival in Vancouver ended a seven-and-a-half-year period of instability for Canucks netminding, with a total of 18 goaltenders having played for the club since Kirk McLean&#x27;s departure in 1998. General manager Brian Burke had coined the term &quot;goalie graveyard&quot; during his tenure in Vancouver to describe the club&#x27;s goaltending fortunes. Luongo recorded a 3–1 win against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender for the first time in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night in the intensive care unit for fears his windpipe would swell and become blocked. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo recorded a shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition&#x27;s top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9 against the San Jose Sharks. He surpassed Kirk McLean&#x27;s 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent&#x27;s 33-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties. In addition to his 47 wins, Luongo recorded a 2.29 GAA (which was at that time, a personal best) and a team-record .921 save percentage (surpassing Dan Cloutier&#x27;s .914 save percentage in 2003–04; later broken by Cory Schneider&#x27;s .929 save percentage in 2010–11). He won three team awards – the Cyclone Taylor Trophy as MVP, the Molson Cup as the player with the most three-star selections, and the Most Exciting Player Award. He led the Canucks to a Northwest Division title and what was then a franchise record of 105 points, The team was seeded third in the Western Conference. The 2007 playoffs marked Luongo&#x27;s first NHL postseason appearance. Facing the sixth-seeded Dallas Stars in the opening round, he almost set an NHL record for most saves in a playoff game in his postseason debut. He stopped 72 shots, en route to a 5–4 quadruple overtime victory, one save shy of Kelly Hrudey&#x27;s 73-save mark set in 1987. Luongo went on to win his first playoff series as the Canucks eliminated the Stars in seven games. They were, however, defeated in the second round by the second-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champions Anaheim Ducks. Luongo put forth a losing 56-save performance in the deciding fifth game against the Ducks. After the game ended in regulation at a 1–1 tie, he missed the first three minutes of the first overtime period to what was first believed to be an equipment malfunction. However, after the series ended, it was revealed that Luongo, instead, had an untimely case of diarrhea. The Canucks lost the game 2–1 in the second overtime when Luongo took his eye off the puck to look at the referee, believing a penalty should have been issued to the Ducks on a play in which Canucks forward Jannik Hansen was hit by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer. With Luongo not paying attention, Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer shot the puck from the point to score the series-winning goal.
At the end of the season, Luongo was nominated for three major NHL awards: the Vezina Trophy as the top goaltender, Lester B. Pearson Award as the most outstanding player judged by members of the NHLPA and Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s regular season MVP. However, Luongo finished second in the voting for all three awards, behind Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils for the Vezina and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Hart and Pearson.

Luongo kept pace statistically with his previous season&#x27;s work in 2007–08 and continued to set significant marks, including a three-game shutout streak spanning 210:34 in late-November (breaking the Canucks&#x27; previous franchise record of 184:20 set by Ken Lockett in 1975). He was voted in as the 2008 NHL All-Star Game&#x27;s Western Conference starting goaltender for the second consecutive season, although he did not attend in order to be with his pregnant wife in Florida.

With the Canucks battling for the Northwest Division title all season long, a losing streak that saw Luongo win only one of his final eight starts caused the Canucks to miss the playoffs altogether by just three points. Nevertheless, he received his second consecutive team MVP and Molson Cup awards. He also finished seventh in Vezina Trophy balloting.

On September 30, 2008, prior to the start of the 2008–09 season, Vancouver Canucks general manager Mike Gillis and head coach Alain Vigneault named Luongo the 12th captain in team history, replacing the departed Markus Näslund. The decision was unconventional, as league rules forbid goaltenders from being captains. As such, Luongo became only the seventh goaltender in NHL history to be named a captain, and the first since Bill Durnan captained the Montreal Canadiens in 1947–48 (after which the league implemented the rule). In order to account for the league rule, Luongo did not perform any of the on-ice duties reserved for captains and did not wear the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; on his jersey. Instead he incorporated it into the artwork on the front of one of his masks which he occasionally wore for the early months of the 2008–09 season. Canucks defenceman Willie Mitchell was designated to handle communications with on-ice officials, while defenceman Mattias Öhlund was responsible for ceremonial faceoffs and other such formalities associated with captaincy. Centre Ryan Kesler was chosen along with Mitchell and Öhlund as the third alternate captain. A month into the 2008–09 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three games against the Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, akin to the feat he accomplished in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2–1 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an adductor strain in his groin. Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within two weeks of the injury, but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen for the fourth time to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier&#x27;s previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001–02. Winning their second Northwest Division title in three years, Luongo and the Canucks returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence as the third seed in the West. During the 2009 playoffs, he led the Canucks to a first round sweep of the sixth-seeded St. Louis Blues. The Canucks then faced the fourth-seeded Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, which Chicago ultimately won in six games. Luongo was heavily criticized following his performance in the sixth and deciding game, allowing seven goals in the 7–5 loss to seal the 4–2 series defeat. In a post-game interview, Luongo told reporters that he &quot;let [his] teammates down&quot;. Many in the Vancouver media were quick to suggest trading Luongo, arguing that his large salary could be better spent, while pointing to several successful teams with relatively low-salary goaltenders. Nevertheless, Luongo was presented at the year-end awards ceremony with the Scotiabank Fan Fav Award, a fan-voted award in its inaugural year for the league&#x27;s favourite player. Also finishing fourth in Vezina Trophy voting, he missed out on his second nomination in three years by one vote, behind Niklas Bäckström of the Minnesota Wild, Steve Mason of the Columbus Blue Jackets and trophy-winner Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins.

With one season left on his original four-year deal with the Canucks, Luongo and agent Gilles Lupien began contract negotiations with general manager Mike Gillis in the 2009 off-season. At the time of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, ESPN reported that Luongo and the Canucks had agreed on a long-term extension to be announced on July 1. The report was, however, denied by both Lupien and Gillis. A little over a month later in early August, Gillis told Vancouver sports radio station TEAM 1040 in an interview that he was &quot;philosophically&quot; close to a deal with Luongo to be signed before the upcoming 2009–10 season. That same month, while at Team Canada&#x27;s summer camp for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Luongo set a September 13 deadline to sign a contract before the Canucks&#x27; training camp began, explaining that he &quot;will not be negotiating during the season ... [not wanting] that distraction&quot;. Several days later, on September 2, the Canucks announced that they had signed Luongo to a 12-year contract extension worth $64 million for a $5.33 million annual salary cap hit. The front-loaded deal, which will expire by the time Luongo is 43 and includes a no-trade clause, sees him make $10 million in 2010–11, then approximately $6.7 million annually through to 2017–18, $3.3 million and $1.6 million the subsequent two seasons, before tailing off to $1 million for the final two years. The contract contains two additional clauses to circumvent the no-trade clause that allow Luongo to facilitate a trade after the fifth year and for the Canucks to also facilitate a trade after the seventh year.

Nearly a month into the 2009–10 season, on October 25, 2009, Luongo recorded his 21st shutout as a Canuck (48th career) in a 2–0 win against the Edmonton Oilers, surpassing Kirk McLean as the franchise shutouts leader. The following game against the Detroit Red Wings on October 27, he suffered a rib injury that was revealed the following day to be a hairline fracture. Luongo originally injured his rib two games prior against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 24 after taking a shot in the chest from Leafs&#x27; forward Niklas Hagman. The injury was re-aggravated during the Detroit game during a collision with Red Wings forward Todd Bertuzzi. He returned to the lineup on November 10 against the St. Louis Blues after missing six games. On January 7, 2010, Luongo recorded his 50th career shutout in a 4–0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes. Despite recording the second 40-win season of his career, Luongo finished with his worst statistical season as a Canuck, heavily affected by a poor second-half. Pulled seven times in 68 appearances, he recorded a 2.57 GAA and a .913 save percentage. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, the Canucks defeated the Los Angeles Kings in six games only to be defeated by the Chicago Blackhawks for the second year in a row.

In the 2010 off-season, it was speculated by many in the media whether Luongo would remain Vancouver&#x27;s captain, citing the added pressure of the goaltending position. After the Canucks&#x27; 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks&#x27; elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that &quot;Serv[ing] as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I will continue to be a leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal.&quot; Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo&#x27;s successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks&#x27; season-opener. Also in the 2010 off-season, Gillis fired Luongo&#x27;s goaltending coach Ian Clark and hired Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo had been a personal friend of Clark&#x27;s and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson leading up to the 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters. Luongo was named the NHL&#x27;s Second Star of the Month for December 2010. He posted an 11–1–2 record with a 2.07 GAA, a .922 save percentage and one shutout within that month. During the month, he started a 21-game regulation unbeaten streak that lasted until a loss against the St. Louis Blues on February 14, 2011. Luongo&#x27;s record in that span was 16 wins and 5 overtime or shootout losses. Later in the campaign, he recorded his 300th career win against the Los Angeles Kings on March 5, 2011. He became the sixth-youngest goaltender to reach the milestone and the 25th overall. 2010–11 campaign constituted a decreased workload for Luongo, as he appeared in 60 games. Team management had asserted at the beginning of the campaign that rookie backup Cory Schneider would be given the opportunity to play in 20 to 25 games. Luongo finished the season with a league-leading 38 wins, along with 22 losses (15 in regulation and 7 in overtime or a shootout). His career-high 2.11 GAA ranked second in the league, behind Tim Thomas&#x27; 2.00, and set a Canucks record, surpassing Dan Cloutier&#x27;s 2.27 GAA, set in 2003–04. While his .928 save percentage improved upon his team-record setting .921 in 2006–07, it was bettered by one-hundredth of a point by Schneider. Together, Luongo and Schneider won the William M. Jennings Trophy for leading the Canucks to the lowest GAA in the league; their combined 2.20 GAA was one-tenth better than the Boston Bruins&#x27;s second-place goaltending tandem of Tim Thomas and Tuukka Rask. Luongo helped the Canucks to their first Presidents&#x27; Trophy in team history with an NHL-best and franchise-record 54 wins and 117 points. His efforts in the regular season earned him his third career Vezina Trophy nomination, alongside the Boston Bruins&#x27; Tim Thomas and the Nashville Predators&#x27; Pekka Rinne. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the first seed in the West and Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners, the Canucks were matched against the Chicago Blackhawks for the third straight year, this time in the first round. After opening the series with three straight wins, the Canucks lost the next three against the eighth-seeded and defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks, forcing a seventh game. After he was pulled in favour of Schneider during Games 4 in Chicago and 5 in Vancouver – having allowed six goal on 28 shots and four goals on 12 shots, respectively – Luongo started Game 6 in Chicago on the bench. During the third period, Schneider suffered a lower-body injury on a Michael Frolík penalty shot goal, forcing Luongo to finish the game. He made 12 saves in relief of Schneider before Blackhawks forward Ben Smith scored in overtime. Although Schneider was available to play for Game 7, Canucks&#x27; head coach Alain Vigneault chose to start Luongo. He made 31 saves in the deciding game, helping the Canucks to a 2–1 overtime win. His efforts included a cross-ice save on a one-timer from Blackhawks forward Patrick Sharp during a Blackhawks powerplay early on in the extra period. Going head-to-head against fellow Vezina Trophy nominee Pekka Rinne and the Nashville Predators in round two, Luongo kept the fifth-seeded Predators to 11 goals over six games to help the Canucks advance to the third round for the first time in 17 years. He maintained his stellar performance in the Western Conference Finals against the second-seeded San Jose Sharks, allowing 13 goals over five contests, including 54 saves in the fifth and deciding match, a game that went to double overtime. Luongo&#x27;s efforts helped the Canucks reach the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. He opened the series against the Boston Bruins stopping all 36 shots in a 1–0 win for his third shutout of the postseason in Game 1 along with a 3–2 overtime win in Game 2. As the series shifted to Boston&#x27;s TD Garden for games three and four with a two-games-to-none Canucks lead, Luongo surrendered eight goals in Game 3 as the Bruins defeated the Canucks 8–1, cutting the Canucks series lead from 2–0 to 2–1. The following contest also, he was pulled for the third time in the playoffs and first time in the Finals after allowing four goals on 20 shots as the Canucks were defeated by the Bruins 4–0, resulting in a 2–2 tie in the series. Amidst heavy scrutiny from the media and Canucks fans after the two blowout losses in Games 3 and 4, Luongo recovered for Game 5 in Vancouver, stopping all 31 Bruins shots in a 1–0 win for a 3–2 series lead. It was his 15th win and fourth shutout of the 2011 postseason and second of the Stanley Cup Finals, tying both of Kirk McLean&#x27;s single-year playoff team records, previously set in 1994. Luongo joined Frank McCool as the only goaltender in NHL history to have two 1–0 shutouts in the same Stanley Cup Finals series as McCool&#x27;s 1–0 victories came 66 years earlier in . With an opportunity to clinch the Stanley Cup in Game 6 in Boston, however, he was pulled again in favour of Schneider after allowing three goals on eight shots in less than three minutes in the first period; the game ended in a 5–2 loss, forcing a Game 7 back home in Vancouver. Despite his struggles in Game 6, he was named the starter for the deciding seventh game by head coach Alain Vigneault over Schneider. Although Luongo and the Canucks had a chance to clinch the Stanley Cup in Game 7 at home, the struggles continued for both Luongo individually and for the Canucks as a team as he allowed three goals (two scored by Bruins&#x27; centre Patrice Bergeron and one by winger Brad Marchand) on 20 shots, including one shorthanded goal by Bergeron before Marchand scored a second goal by an empty netter, as the Canucks lost the game 4–0 and the series 4–3 against the third-seeded Bruins, one win short of winning the Stanley Cup. Luongo had the chance of joining the Triple Gold Club as the first goaltender in this finals series had the Canucks won Game 6 or Game 7.
Nearly a month and a half into the 2011–12 season, Luongo suffered an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games. The nature of the injury was unspecified, but was believed to have occurred during a game against his former team, the New York Islanders on November 13, 2011, when he appeared to be in discomfort. Prior to the injury, Luongo was struggling to perform with his statistics near the bottom of the league. Upon recovering, Schneider&#x27;s play relegated Luongo to backup status for five games. By December 2011, he resumed as the team&#x27;s starter with an improved performance. The following month, Luongo reached two milestones. On January 4, 2012, he became the 23rd goaltender in league history to play in his 700th game, a contest in which he recorded a 3–0 shutout against the Minnesota Wild. With his 212th victory as a Canuck on January 21 (a 4–3 win against the San Jose Sharks), he surpassed Kirk McLean as the most-wins goaltender in team history. Luongo accomplished the feat in 364 games, 152 less than McLean. Facing the eighth-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings in the opening round of the 2012 playoffs after helping the Canucks win a second consecutive Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Vigneault opted to start Schneider for the rest of the series, in order to give the Canucks some momentum on their side, and Luongo remained on the bench for the remainder of the series as the Kings won four games to one. Dressing as a backup for the Canucks&#x27; final three playoff games led many in the media to believe that Luongo would be traded in the off-season, in favour of Schneider, who recorded better regular season and playoff statistics than him in 2011–12. Asked about his role with the Canucks following the defeat, Luongo told reporters that he would waive his no-trade clause if his management asked him to do so. In June 2012, Schneider was signed to a three-year $12 million contract, which made Luongo expendable, but general manager Mike Gillis&#x27; efforts to trade Luongo were unsuccessful owing to his $64 million (U.S.), 12-year contract.
In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, both goaltenders split the playing duties although Schneider was the number one goaltender. Luongo handled his demotion with class and remained supportive of Schneider, soon calling the Canucks &quot;Cory&#x27;s team.&quot; Head coach Alain Vigneault said &quot;Cory is our MVP and one of reasons why we got into playoffs. I&#x27;ve got a lot of faith in him and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going with him&quot;. In the opening round of the 2013 playoffs facing the San Jose Sharks, as Schneider had been injured near the end of the season, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Luongo came off the bench in game three after Schneider was pulled in the third period. Luongo was the backup in game four as the Canucks lost in overtime, ending his team&#x27;s postseason in four straight games. Luongo put his penthouse up for sale, as it was accepted that he had likely played his final game as a Canuck. Although he had nine years left on a 12-year, $64-million contract, which represented a $5.33 million salary cap hit, general manager Mike Gillis remained confident of making a deal in the summer.

Schneider was unexpectedly traded to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, reinstating Luongo in the starting position for the 2013–14. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after their first round sweep at the hands of the San Jose Sharks, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella&#x27;s decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season with it being outside.

===Return to Florida (2014–2019)===

On March 4, 2014, a day before the NHL trade deadline, Luongo was traded back to the Florida Panthers along with prospect Steven Anthony in exchange for goaltender Jacob Markström and centre Shawn Matthias. The Canucks retained part of Luongo&#x27;s salary. Luongo was seen as key to helping build the Panthers into a strong contender.

On March 3, 2015, Luongo suffered a chipped bone in his shoulder in a 3–2 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs as a result from taking a shot from Leafs&#x27; forward Leo Komarov. He would leave the game momentarily but then return to finish the game before missing the next six games. The 2014–15 season would end with the Panthers missing the playoffs for the third straight season and Luongo finishing with a 28–19–12 record, two shutouts, 2.35 GAA and 921 save percentage in 61 games.

Luongo ended the 2015–16 season playing in 62 games with a 35–19–6 record, four shutouts, 2.35 GAA and .992 save percentage to help the Panthers qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2012. During the 2016 playoffs, the Panthers would go on to lose in the first round against Luongo&#x27;s former team, the New York Islanders in six games with Islanders centre and captain John Tavares scoring the series-winning goal in double overtime of Game 6 to prevent the Panthers from forcing a seventh game.

In the 2016 off-season, it was revealed that Luongo underwent hip surgery, but would recover in time for the start of the 2016–17 season. The season would be a struggle for Luongo and the Panthers as a team as they would miss the playoffs and Luongo would finish with a 17–15–6 record with one shutout, 2.68 GAA and .915 save percentage in 40 games.

On December 4, 2017, in a 5–4 SO loss to the New York Islanders, Luongo suffered a torn groin as a result of sticking his leg out to make a save on a shot from Islanders&#x27; defenceman Ryan Pulock, causing him to miss the next 27 games. On April 5, 2018, Luongo played in his 1,000th NHL game in a 3–2 win over the Boston Bruins, becoming just the third goaltender in NHL history to do so, the other two being Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur. At the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, Luongo was the Panthers&#x27; nomination for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy and eventually a finalist for the award by the NHL and became the franchise all-time leader in games played, wins, and shutouts. The season ended with the Panthers missing the playoffs by just one point in the standings. The Masterton Trophy would eventually go to New Jersey Devils forward Brian Boyle.

On February 10, 2019, Luongo played in his 1030th career game against the inner-state rival Tampa Bay Lightning, passing Roy for second all-time behind Brodeur, who played 1,266 games in his career. With a 4–3 win against the Colorado Avalanche on February 25, Luongo passed Ed Belfour for third-most wins as an NHL goaltender, once again only behind Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur.

On June 26, 2019, Luongo announced his retirement from professional hockey, despite having three years left on his contract largely citing lingering effects from surgeries on his hip and groin the previous two seasons.

==International play==






Luongo made his international debut at the 1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in Moncton, New Brunswick, with Team Québec, winning bronze. Three years later, he was named to the Canadian national junior team for the 1998 World Junior Championships in Finland. He played backup to Victoriaville Tigres goaltender Mathieu Garon, going winless in three appearances with a 3.70 GAA, as Canada finished in eighth place. Luongo became the starting goaltender the following year at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba, appearing in seven of Canada&#x27;s eight games. He recorded a shutout in the first game of the tournament against the Czech Republic, making 36 saves in a 0–0 tie. He went on to help Team Canada to the gold medal game against Russia, but lost in overtime, surrendering a goal to Artem Chubarov. With a 1.92 GAA and two shutouts, Luongo was given Best Goaltender and All-Star team honours.

Luongo first appeared with the Canadian men&#x27;s team at the 2001 World Championships in Germany. He played backup to Fred Brathwaite of the Calgary Flames before injuring his finger during the first game of the qualification round against Switzerland on May 4, 2001.

During his next appearance at the 2003 World Championships in Finland, Luongo began the tournament as backup to the Phoenix Coyotes&#x27; Sean Burke. He earned wins against Latvia in the preliminaries and Switzerland in the qualifying round. During the semifinals against the Czech Republic, Luongo replaced Burke after he left the game with a lower-body injury eight minutes into the second period. Luongo allowed four goals in relief, but earned the win as Canada defeated the Czechs 8–4. With Burke still out for the gold medal game, Luongo made 49 saves against Sweden in a 3–2 overtime win. Despite Luongo&#x27;s medal-round efforts, Burke was named the Best Goaltender for the tournament, as he played in the majority of Team Canada&#x27;s games. The gold medal-winning 2003 team was later named the Canadian Press national sports team of the year on January 2, 2004.

Luongo made his third appearance at the World Championships in 2004 in the Czech Republic. He played in seven games as the starting goaltender, recording a 2.32 GAA and one shutout, as Canada captured its second straight gold medal at the tournament, beating Sweden 5–3 in the final. Several months later, Luongo competed for Team Canada in the 2004 World Cup as backup to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. It marked Luongo&#x27;s first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible, as the annual World Championships conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs. He had another opportunity to step in as the starting goaltender when Brodeur pulled out prior to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist. Filling in for Brodeur, Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4–3 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against Finland. Brodeur returned for the championship game to backstop Team Canada to a 3–2 win.

Luongo appeared in his fourth World Championships in 2005. Owing to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, all NHL players were available for the tournament in Austria, and Luongo played backup to Brodeur. He appeared in two games, including a shutout win against Slovenia in the round-robin. Luongo earned a silver medal as Team Canada was shut out by the Czech Republic 3–0 in the final.
Luongo was named to his first Winter Olympics in 2006. The tournament was held in Turin, Italy, his country of cultural origin. He again played behind Brodeur and appeared in two games. He made his Olympic debut in the second game of the round-robin with a 5–1 win against Germany. His second appearance of the tournament was a loss to Finland, also in the round-robin.

Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics, to be held in Luongo&#x27;s NHL hometown of Vancouver, Luongo and Brodeur were considered locks to be named to the national team heading into the summer orientation camp in August 2009 and speculation began as to who would be appointed the starting position. On December 31, 2009, Luongo was selected to Team Canada, along with Brodeur and Marc-André Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins as the three goaltenders. Luongo was given the start for the first game against Norway. He recorded his first Olympic shutout, making 15 saves in an 8–0 win to open the tournament. After Brodeur surrendered four goals in a 5–3 loss to the United States in their final preliminary game, Luongo replaced him as the starting goaltender. He helped Canada to four consecutive single-elimination game wins against Germany, Russia, Slovakia and the United States to capture the gold medal. During the semifinal against Slovakia, Luongo made a game-saving stop against Canucks teammate Pavol Demitra with nine seconds to go in regulation. With Slovakia&#x27;s goaltender pulled and down by a goal, the puck bounced to Demitra by the side of the net. Out of position, Luongo managed to get his glove on the puck, deflecting it away from the net and preserving the win. In the subsequent gold medal game, Luongo made 34 saves in Canada&#x27;s overtime win against the United States.

The following month, Luongo carried the torch into Robson Square in Downtown Vancouver for the 2010 Paralympics on March 11, 2010.

Four years later, Luongo was selected to Team Canada for his third straight Olympics. Heading into the Sochi Games as the incumbent starter, there was much debate among the media as to whether he or Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price would play most of Canada&#x27;s games.

==Playing style==

Luongo played in the butterfly style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. Owing to the style of play, groin injuries are common for butterfly goaltenders. Luongo suffered one during the 2008–09 season and missed 24 games.

As an athletic goaltender, Luongo was known for having quick reflexes, particularly with his glove. One of Luongo&#x27;s early goaltending coaches, François Allaire, remembered Luongo to have had the &quot;best catching glove [he&#x27;d] ever seen in a kid&quot; when he first came to his goaltending school in Sainte-Thérèse-de-Gaspé, Québec, at the age of 14. Allaire is known to be a strong proponent of the butterfly style. At 6 feet and 3 inches, Luongo was able to cover a lot of net with his size. Observers also noted the strong concentration, competitiveness and mental aspects of his game. On the other hand, his puck-handling skills have been described as a weakness.

His style began to be directed during his midget years with Allaire and Montreal-Bourassa goaltending coach Mario Baril. Luongo sent tapes of his play to Allaire during his rookie season in the QMJHL and his former goaltending coach advised him to be more aggressive and come out of the net more to cut off angles and challenge shooters. the Canucks hired a new goaltending coach, Roland Melanson, prior to the 2010–11 season. Working with Melanson, Luongo began playing deeper in his crease against Allaire&#x27;s original advice, allowing him to maintain positioning for rebounds.

Vancouver Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault said in March 2007 that Luongo played best with more playing time over the length of the season. Throughout his career, he garnered lots of playing time, including four consecutive 70-game seasons from 2003–04 to 2007–08 between the Florida Panthers and Canucks. He was known to suffer from slow starts to the season, usually in the first month of October. In his first three Octobers with the Canucks, Luongo posted a combined 10–13–0 record and a .899 save percentage – numbers that were well below his career pace.

Luongo received the Mark Messier Leadership Award in his first season with the Canucks for the month of March 2007. Prior to the 2008–09 season, his third season with Vancouver, he was named Markus Näslund&#x27;s successor as team captain and the first goaltender to be named a captain in 59 years. Teammate Mattias Öhlund, who served as alternate captain to Luongo for one season, described him as a vocal leader, while Luongo has also identified that quality in himself. General manager Mike Gillis described his commitment level as &quot;unprecedented&quot;, adding that &quot;he&#x27;d be a great example for our younger guys&quot;, at the time of the captaincy announcement. He served in that capacity for two seasons before relinquishing the captaincy prior to the 2010–11 season to forward Henrik Sedin.

==Post-playing career==
The Panthers would then retire his number on March 7, 2020, with Luongo becoming the first player to earn this honor with the franchise.

Luongo served as Assistant GM for Canada&#x27;s hockey team during the 2022 Winter Olympics.

Luongo joined the Panthers&#x27; front office in 2019, as a special advisor to general manager Bill Zito. He won his first Stanley Cup as an executive with the Panthers in 2024 as the Panthers defeated the Edmonton Oilers in seven games in the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals.

==Personal life==
While playing with the Florida Panthers, Luongo met his wife, Gina (née Cerbone), at a team hangout called the Pizza Time Trattoria. Gina is the daughter of the Italian restaurant owner, Umberto Cerbone, who is originally from Naples, while Gina&#x27;s mother is from Palermo. Luongo proposed to Gina under the Bridge of Sighs in Venice in 2004. They lived in Broward County, Florida, during his tenure with the Panthers. However within a month of moving into a new home in Florida, Luongo was traded to Vancouver. They subsequently moved into the Vancouver neighbourhood of Yaletown, while spending Luongo&#x27;s off-seasons in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Luongo had been chosen as a starting goaltender for the 2008 NHL All-Star Game, but he chose not to attend in order to be with Gina, who was pregnant at the time and had returned to Florida. Their daughter was born on March 27, 2008. On December 27, 2010, Gina gave birth to the couple&#x27;s son.

Luongo is involved with several charities. Like many Canucks players, he spent time with Canuck Place, a children&#x27;s hospice in Vancouver. He also sponsored a spectator&#x27;s box in Rogers Arena that was reserved for underprivileged children to attend Canucks games. At the end of games in which he was named one of the three stars, he was known to give away his goaltenders stick to a fan in the crowd. In the summer of 2009, he hosted the Roberto Luongo Golf Open to benefit Montreal Children&#x27;s Hospital, Sainte-Justine Hospital, and a seniors centre network in Saint-Léonard. After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Luongo, who lives in Parkland, gave a pre-game speech acknowledging the victims of the shooting and calling for action against mass shootings.

In addition to being an avid golfer, Luongo also enjoys playing poker.

In September 2011, Luongo was inducted into the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario. He was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 2021.

<doc id="440399" wikidata="Q1387113" url="?curid=440399" title="Wade Redden">
<text>Wade Redden (born June 12, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and a development coach of the Ottawa Senators, with whom he spent the majority of his career in the National Hockey League (NHL), which lasted from 1996 to 2013. He also played for the New York Rangers, St. Louis Blues and Boston Bruins. He played for the Canadian national team internationally seven times, winning two gold medals in the World Junior Championships and one in the World Cup of Hockey. He was a two-time NHL All-Star.

==Early life==
Born on June 12, 1977, in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Redden, who is Métis, grew up in Hillmond, Saskatchewan. Redden went to school at Hillmond, where he completed kindergarten to grade nine. He went to Lloydminster comprehensive school for grade ten. He then completed his 11th and 12th year in Brandon, Manitoba at Crocus Plains Regional High School while playing for the Brandon Wheat Kings. Redden has an older sister Nikki, and an older brother, Bart making him the youngest of three.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Redden played minor hockey with the teams at Hillmond High School, and the Mid West Red Wings, which were from the rural area. After that, he played one year with the Lloydminster Blazers, before joining the Western Hockey League (WHL)&#x27;s Brandon Wheat Kings for the 1993–94 season. In his first year of major junior hockey with Brandon, he was awarded the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy for WHL rookie of the year honours. The Wheat Kings made it to two Memorial Cup appearances, in 1995 and 1996, whilst Redden was a member of the team. He was also a member of the 1995 and 1996 Canadian teams at the World Junior Hockey Championships, both teams winning gold medals.

===Pre-Senators===
Redden was originally selected second overall by the New York Islanders in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, but never played for the team – he was traded in a three-team deal with the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs that saw his rights, along with Kirk Muller, Ken Belanger, Damian Rhodes, Don Beaupre, Martin Straka and the rights to Bryan Berard move between the teams on January 23, 1996. The trade had become necessary when the Senators&#x27; efforts to sign Berard, whom they had selected first overall in the same draft, had become futile.

===Ottawa Senators===
Redden joined the Senators from the Wheat Kings for the 1996–97 season, making the team out of his first training camp. He scored his first career NHL goal on his first shot, against Jocelyn Thibault of the Montreal Canadiens on October 5, 1996. Redden would be named NHL Rookie of the Month for April 1997, and was an important part of the team&#x27;s drive to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs that season; The appearance was the first in modern Senators&#x27; history.

By the 1999–2000 season, Redden was an important part of the team. On October 2, 1999, he was named alternate captain of the Senators, a position he eventually held for nine seasons. Near the end of the season, however, he suffered an ankle injury, forcing him to miss the 2000 playoffs, a contributing factor in the Senators losing in the first round to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Despite the injury setback, the following year Redden continued his improvement, averaging over 25 minutes of ice time per game, scoring 37 assists, recording a three-point game as well as several two-point games. After the Senators were eliminated from the 2001 playoffs, he was named to the Team Canada&#x27;s senior team for the first time for the 2001 IIHF World Championship.

The next year, 2001–02, Redden was named to the 2002 NHL All-Star Game to represent the Senators. In the next season, he would have nine multi-point games in 2002–03 and would set a personal best of 17 goals in the following 2003–04 season, which helped earn him a spot in the 2004 NHL All-Star Game. He was also named to the gold medal-winning Canadian team for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and would also play for Canada in the 2005 IIHF World Championship.

In the 2005–06 season, Redden missed games due to a knee injury and to be with his mother, Pat, as she battled cancer. He finished the season with a career-high 50 points and a joint-NHL-leading plus-minus rating of +35 in 65 games. He also had 12 multi-point games, including a four-point game against the New York Rangers on December 26, 2005. For his career-season, Redden was selected to Team Canada&#x27;s roster, along with teammate Dany Heatley, for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

After the 2005–06 season, the Senators were faced with having their two top defencemen (Redden and Zdeno Chára) becoming unrestricted free agents, and having to choose to sign only one to keep the team salaries within the League-mandated salary cap. The Senators ultimately chose to retain Redden, and the two agreed on a two-year, $13 million contract with a no-trade clause; Chára signed instead with the Boston Bruins. Redden&#x27;s salary made him the highest-paid player on the team, and the media and fans expected another top-notch season. Redden being of Metis descent, was noted to be the highest paid aboriginal player in the NHL. The 2006–07 NHL season was a difficult one for Redden, however, playing with a new defensive partner, Andrej Meszároš, who had previously played on a defensive pair alongside Chára. Despite the initial struggles, by the time of the 2007 playoffs, Redden and Meszároš had jelled and were a strong pairing for the Senators. Redden participated in all of Ottawa&#x27;s run to the Stanley Cup Finals, recording 10 points in 20 playoff games, albeit in a losing effort as the Senators eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in five games.

The 2007–08 was eventful for Redden. Newly promoted general manager Bryan Murray attempted to trade Redden to the Edmonton Oilers during the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Redden turned down the trade proposal. Trade rumours would swirl around Redden for most of the season, though he remained a starter with the team and played in his 800th career NHL game on January 10, 2008, against the Buffalo Sabres. As the team began to slump, Murray started to look for solutions to turn the team around. In February 2008, it was revealed that Redden used the no-trade clause in his contract to kill a deal that would have sent him to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Matt Carle and a draft pick. As the leaked deal became public, Redden publicly declared his desire to win the Stanley Cup with Ottawa, at the time still the Eastern Conference leader. Within weeks of the aborted trade, the Sharks surpassed Ottawa in the League-wide standings, and the Senators performance continued to decline; the coach was eventually fired and the team struggled into the playoffs.

Redden&#x27;s numbers improved slightly over the previous season, but this was overshadowed by the size of his contract and the team&#x27;s overall performance. The 2007–08 season was also the last season of the contract and speculation about his re-signing was regularly discussed in the media. Redden made clear that he would take a &quot;hometown discount&quot;, taking less money to stay in Ottawa. After the season, the media openly speculated that Redden would be leaving the Senators.

===New York Rangers===
On July 1, 2008, Redden signed a six-year, $39 million contract as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden&#x27;s performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism – one writer for the &quot;New York Post&quot; even called the contract &quot;the worst in the history of the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports.&quot; On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman&#x27;s declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, &quot;I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… I felt like the first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn&#x27;t doing enough, and like I should have been doing more. Once I started feeling that way, I think I just got away from the things that made me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there.&quot;
Redden cleared waivers and was assigned to the Rangers&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, becoming the highest-paid player in the history of the AHL in the process. Redden admitted contemplating retirement after the demotion, though he ultimately decided to report and play for Hartford. Of Redden&#x27;s ill-fated signing with the Rangers, one newspaper later commented that &quot;through no fault of his own, [Redden] has become the poster-boy for free-agent foolishness.&quot; In the 2011–12 season, Redden served as the captain of the Connecticut Whale, the Wolf Pack&#x27;s new name.

====2012–13 lockout====
At the time of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, the Rangers decided not to transfer Redden to the AHL roster, thereby not having to pay his salary during the labour dispute. When the lockout was settled, however, the newly ratified NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) directly affected Redden in two ways: 1) It forced teams to count any AHL player&#x27;s salary above $900,000 against its NHL cap; and 2) It allowed for up to two contracts per team to be bought out for up to two-thirds of the remaining salary, without the buyout counting against the cap in the 2013 and/or 2014 off-seasons, so as to help teams get under the reduced cap, also known as a compliance buyout. However, the buyouts cannot be used on injured players, so, to avoid any risk of a hockey-related injury, the Rangers originally instructed Redden to simply not report to camp.

While this meant that Redden (along with Scott Gomez of the Montreal Canadiens, who was in a similar situation) would still have been paid his prorated 2012–13 salary despite not playing, the NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) was concerned that for Redden and Gomez to be forced to spend an entire year away from hockey would adversely affect their ability to find employment elsewhere in the NHL during the 2013 off-season, even at a much reduced salary. On January 15, in order to avoid this process, the CBA was revised to allow teams to use one of their two compliance buyouts prior to the start of the shortened 2012–13 season, with the provision that the players bought-out in such a way would still be paid their prorated but otherwise full 2012–13 salaries (which would still count against the 2012–13 cap), and with the buyout of the subsequent years otherwise proceeding as originally intended.

With the revised Agreement in place, Redden was waived by the Rangers on January 16, 2013, and cleared waivers the following day. After a compliance buyout from the Rangers was completed, Redden became a free agent for the first time since 2008.

===Return to NHL===
On January 18, 2013, the eve of the shortened 2012–13 season, Redden signed a one-year, $800,000 contract with the St. Louis Blues. The Blues activated Redden on January 23, opening the door for him to play the following night against the Nashville Predators. To make room for Redden, the Blues demoted Ian Cole to the Peoria Rivermen of the AHL. On January 24, against Nashville, Redden played his first NHL game since April 11, 2010. He scored his first goal back against the Dallas Stars on January 26, and played his 1,000th career NHL game on February 7, against the Detroit Red Wings.

At the 2013 NHL trade deadline, Redden was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for a conditional seventh-round pick in 2014 on April 3. The Bruins hoped he would rediscover the chemistry he had with former Senators teammate Zdeno Chára and return to elite form, though he was a non-factor for the Bruins. In six regular season games with the Bruins, Redden scored one goal and had one assist. In the first game of the conference quarterfinals series of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, Redden scored a goal and added an assist in the Bruins&#x27; 4–1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.

On January 9, 2014, Redden announced his retirement from professional ice hockey.

==Post-playing career==
On June 27, 2016, Redden joined the Nashville Predators organization as assistant director of player development, specifically to evaluate prospects and ease their transition to the NHL with mentorship.

On July 11, 2022, Redden was named as the development coach for the Ottawa Senators.

==Personal life==
Redden sponsored a suite at Scotiabank Place, named Wade&#x27;s World and reserved for critically and terminally ill children, while a member of the Senators from 1997 until 2008.

<text>Juan de Grijalva (; c. 1490 – 21 January 1527) was a Spanish conquistador, and a relative of Diego Velázquez. He went to Hispaniola in 1508 and to Cuba in 1511. He was one of the early explorers of the Mexican coastline, and was killed by natives in Honduras on 21 January 1527.

==1518 expedition==

In 1518, Grijalva became one of the first to explore the shores of Mexico. According to Hernán Cortés, 170 people went with him, but according to Pedro Mártir, there were 300 people.&lt;br&gt; 
The main pilot was Antón de Alaminos, the other pilots were Juan Álvarez (also known as &quot;el Manquillo&quot;), Pedro Camacho de Triana, and Grijalva. Other members included Francisco de Montejo, Pedro de Alvarado, Bernal Díaz del Castillo, Juan Díaz, Francisco Peñalosa, Alonso de Ávila, Alonso Hernández, Antonio Villafaña and two natives from Yucatan, Julianillo (&quot;Julian&quot;) and Melchorejo (&quot;Melchor&quot;), who were captured during the Hernández de Córdoba expedition and now served as interpreters.&lt;br&gt; 
They embarked from the port of Matanzas, Cuba, with four ships on 8 April 1518.
After rounding the Guaniguanico in Cuba, Grijalva sailed along the Mexican coast, discovered Cozumel on 3 May 1518, and arrived on 8 June 1518 at the Tabasco region in southern Mexico. The Río Grijalva in Mexico was named after him. He was also the first Spaniard to encounter Moctezuma II&#x27;s delegation. One of the natives joined them, being baptized as Francisco, and became a Nahuatl interpreter on Cortes&#x27; expedition. Bernal Díaz del Castillo wrote about the travels of Juan de Grijalva in his book &quot;Historia de las Indias.&quot;.

According to W H Prescott&#x27;s &quot;Conquest of Mexico,&quot; Grijalva was the first Spaniard to bring back word of the plentiful gold hoard of the Aztecs, inflaming passions for conquest. In 1518 Hernán Cortés stayed at Juan&#x27;s home in Trinidad, Cuba, at the start of his Mexican expedition. He recruited men there, including the five Alvarado brothers.

Juan de Grijalva was killed by natives in Honduras on 21 January 1527.

<doc id="440404" wikidata="Q5639013" url="?curid=440404" title="Haider al-Abadi">
<text>Haider Jawad Kadhim al-Abadi (; born 25 April 1952) is an Iraqi politician who was Prime Minister of Iraq from September 2014 until October 2018. Previously he served as Minister of Communication from 2003 to 2004, in the first government after Saddam Hussein was deposed.

He was designated as prime minister by President Fuad Masum on 11 August 2014 to succeed Nouri al-Maliki and was approved by the Iraqi parliament on 8 September 2014. Al-Abadi was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People of 2018.&quot;

In office throughout the majority of the War in Iraq (2013–2017) which he announced victory against ISIL, he later left the office of Prime Minister in 2018, following rising domestic discontent and widespread violent protests.

==Early life and education==

al-Abadi was born to a Shia Arab family in Baghdad. Al-Abadi&#x27;s father was a member of the Baghdad Neurosurgery Hospital and Inspector General of the Iraqi Ministry of Health. He was forced to retire in 1979 due to disagreements with the Ba&#x27;athist regime, and was buried in the US after his death. Al-Abadi, who speaks English, graduated high school in 1970 from the Central High School () in Bagdad. In 1975, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Technology in Baghdad. In 1980, he earned a PhD degree in electrical engineering from the University of Manchester.

==Career==
Al-Abadi joined the Dawa Party in 1967. Two of his brothers were killed and one was put in prison 1980, 1981, and 1982 for belonging to the Dawa Party. In 1981, his third brother was arrested and spent 10 years in prison. In 1977, he became in charge of its organization in Britain. In 1979, he became a member of the party&#x27;s executive leadership. In 1983, the government confiscated al-Abadi&#x27;s passport for conspiring against Iraq&#x27;s Ba&#x27;ath Party.

===Exile===

Al-Abadi remained in the UK, in voluntary exile, until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. His positions during this time included:
*Director general of a small design and development firm in London specialising in high-technology vertical and horizontal transportation (1993–2003)
*Consultant, in London, in matters relating to transportation (1987–2003)
*Research leader for a major modernization contract in London (1981–1986)

Al-Abadi was awarded a grant from the UK Department of Trade and Industry in 1998. While working in London in 2001 al-Abadi registered a patent relating to rapid transit systems.

===Return to Iraq===
In 2003, al-Abadi became skeptical of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) privatization plan, proposing to Paul Bremer that they had to wait for a legitimate government to be formed. In October 2003, al-Abadi with all 25 of the interim Governing Council ministers protested to Paul Bremer and rejected the CPA&#x27;s demand to privatize the state-owned companies and infrastructure prior to forming a legitimate government. The CPA, led by Bremer, fell out with al-Abadi and the Governing Council. The CPA worked around the Governing Council, forming a new government that remained beholden to the CPA to serve until the general elections, prompting more aggressive armed actions by insurgents against US-led coalition personnel.

While al-Abadi was Minister of Communications, the CPA awarded licenses to three mobile operators to cover all parts of Iraq. Despite being rendered nearly powerless by the CPA, Al-Abadi was not prepared to be &quot;a rubber stamp&quot; and introduced more conditions for the licenses. Among them that a sovereign Iraqi government has the power to amend or terminate the licenses and introduce a fourth national license, which caused some friction with the CPA. In 2003, press reports indicated Iraqi officials were under investigation over a questionable deal involving Orascom, an Egypt-based telecoms company, which in late 2003 was awarded a contract to provide a mobile network to central Iraq. Al-Abadi asserted that there was no illicit dealing in the completed awards. In 2004, it was revealed that these allegations were fabrications, and a US Defense Department review found that telecommunications contracting had been illegally influenced in an unsuccessful effort led by disgraced US Deputy Undersecretary of Defense John A. Shaw and not by Iraqis.

Between January and December 2005, he served as an adviser to the Prime Minister of Iraq in the first elected government.

He was elected as a member of the Iraqi Parliament in the December 2005 parliamentary election and chaired the parliamentary committee for Economy, Investment and Reconstruction. Al-Abadi was re-elected in the 2010 parliamentary election as a member of the Iraqi Parliament representing Baghdad. In 2013, he chaired the Finance Committee and was at the center of a parliamentary dispute over the allocation of the 2013 Iraqi budget.

Al-Abadi&#x27;s name was circulated as a prime ministerial candidate during the formation of the Iraqi government in 2006 during which time Ibrahim al-Jaafari was replaced by Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister.

In 2008, al-Abadi remained steadfast in his support of Iraqi sovereignty, insisting on specific conditions to the agreement with the U.S. regarding its presence in Iraq.

In 2009, al-Abadi was identified by the Middle East Economic Digest as a key person to watch in Iraq&#x27;s reconstruction.

He is an active member of the Iraq Petroleum Advisory Committee, participating in the Iraq Petroleum Conferences of 2009–2012 organized by Nawar Abdulhadi and Phillip Clarke of The CWC Group.

He was one of several Iraqi politicians supporting a suit against Blackwater as a result of the 2010 dismissal of criminal charges against Blackwater personnel involved in the 2007 killing of 17 Iraqi civilians.

Al-Abadi was again tapped as a possible prime minister during the tough negotiations between Iraqi political blocs after the elections of 2010 to choose a replacement to incumbent PM Nouri al-Maliki. Again in 2014, he was nominated by Shia political parties as an alternative candidate for Prime Minister.

===Prime Minister (2014–2018)===
 
On 24 July 2014, Fuad Masum became the new president of Iraq. He, in turn, nominated al-Abadi for prime minister on 11 August. For the appointment to take effect, al-Abadi was required to form a government to be confirmed by Parliament within 30 days. Al-Maliki, however, refused to give up his post and referred the matter to the federal court claiming the president&#x27;s nomination was a &quot;constitutional violation&quot;. He said, &quot;The insistence on this until the end is to protect the state.&quot; On 14 August 2014, in the face of growing calls from world leaders and members of his own party, the embattled prime minister announced he was stepping down to make way for al-Abadi. The announcement of the leadership transition from al-Maliki to al-Abadi triggered a major realignment of Sunni Arab public opinion away from armed opposition groups and to the Iraqi government, since many Iraqi Sunni Arabs were optimistic that the new government would address their grievances and deliver public goods and services to them.

The Iraqi Parliament approved al-Abadi&#x27;s new government and his presidential program on 8 September 2014. In the months after assuming office in September 2014, Abadi made determined efforts to increase Sunni participation in the Iraqi government. Abadi appointed Khaled al-Obaidi, a prominent Sunni politician from Mosul, as his Defense Minister, and the appointment was ratified by the Iraqi parliament after two months. In mid-December 2014, Abadi forged a new revenue-sharing agreement with the Kurds, under which Baghdad agreed to pay the Kurdish Regional Government one half of all income from Kurdish-controlled oil fields. To counter the widespread corruption in the army stemming from the Maliki years, Abadi announced that 50,000 &quot;ghost soldiers&quot; had been identified and would be removed from army payrolls. &quot;Ghost soldiers&quot; were men on army payrolls who never showed up for duty, but paid their officers part of their salaries, thus institutionalizing corruption and hollowing out the armed forces.

Iraqi President Fuad Masum paid a goodwill visit to Saudi Arabia in November 2014. In response, Saudi Arabia prepared to reopen its embassy in Baghdad, which had remained closed since the start of the Gulf War in 1990. Abadi has also visited Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey to discuss regional strategies to combat militant Islamist forces. &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine has written that after four months in power, Abadi&#x27;s attempts to resolve Iraq&#x27;s sectarian strife make his premiership &quot;a welcome change from the schismatic style of his predecessor&quot;. As a result of Abadi&#x27;s reforms, the United States pledged $1.5 billion to train Iraqi forces and announced the sale of F-16 fighter jets, suspended after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Combating political corruption was an early priority of the al-Abadi administration. In August 2015, al-Abadi unveiled a plan to strengthen the government by, among other things, eliminating security details for senior officials and cutting benefits to specific high-level officials.

Al-Abadi was forced to contend with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant as prime minister; he was sometimes critical of Barack Obama and the United States military response to the threat of ISIL. Furthermore, al-Abadi pivoted closer towards Russia and Iran in order to combat the threat of ISIL and encouraged cooperation between these nations on military operations in the region.

In April, 2016, al-Abadi&#x27;s difficulties in implementing political reforms led to the storming of the Iraqi parliament by supporters of Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The protesters breaching the Green Zone and disrupting the parliament have been described as evidence of Iraq&#x27;s increasingly dysfunctional political system and al-Abadi&#x27;s problems in getting corruption under control.

On 9 December 2017, Prime Minister Al-Abadi announced victory over ISIL and the end of the Iraqi Civil War (2014-2017).

Abadi was succeeded by Adil Abdul-Mahdi on 25 October 2018.

<doc id="440405" wikidata="Q537382" url="?curid=440405" title="Patrick Marleau">
<text>Patrick Denis Marleau (born September 15, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward. With 1,779 NHL games played, he is the all-time leader in regular season games played in league history. He passed the record previously held by Gordie Howe in his 1,768th game on April 19, 2021. Marleau scored 1,197 points during his entire NHL career. The San Jose Sharks drafted Marleau second overall in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, and Marleau spent the vast majority of his NHL career with the franchise, becoming its all-time leader in goals, even strength goals, power play goals, points, shots, and games played. Marleau is also the fourth player in National Hockey League history to record 900 consecutive games played, reaching the mark one game after breaking the overall games played record. He was the third-last active player who played in the NHL in the 1990s, with the other being Zdeno Chára and Joe Thornton.

Marleau is one of just five NHL players to play 1,400 games with one team, and the youngest to reach both the 1,300- and 1,400-game marks. He was seven games short of becoming the youngest player to play in 1,500 games with one team before signing with his second team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, in 2017. After two seasons with Toronto, he returned to San Jose in 2019, and was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins before the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs. After failing to win a Stanley Cup, Marleau returned to the Sharks as a free agent for the 2020–21 season, his final season. Marleau holds the distinction of playing the most NHL games (both regular season and playoffs) without winning the Stanley Cup, an active streak as of the end of the 2023–24 season. His number, 12, was retired by the Sharks on February 25, 2023. 

Internationally, Marleau won gold medals with Canada at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics. Marleau, one of the most important players of the Sharks for nearly 20 seasons, was known as one of the fastest skaters in the NHL and exhibited a high standard of playing ability combined with gentlemanly conduct. This earned him two nominations for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy and made him a popular player both among fans and his professional peers.

==Early years==
Marleau was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, to parents Denis and Jeanette Marleau and grew up on his family farm near Aneroid. A sign near Saskatchewan Highway 13, just outside Aneroid, proclaims that it is Marleau&#x27;s hometown. His parents have said they knew Marleau had a special talent when he was playing with 16- and 17-year-old players as a 14-year-old at the 1995 Canada Games in Grande Prairie and was interviewed by &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; reporter Scott Oake.

==Playing career==

===Junior career===
Marleau&#x27;s junior hockey career took him to the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League (WHL), where he played two seasons. In his rookie campaign in 1995–96, Marleau exploded onto the scene in Seattle scoring 32 goals and 74 points, leading his team to a playoff loss to the defending Memorial Cup champions, the Kamloops Blazers, featuring future NHL star Jarome Iginla. The series ended 4–1, but Seattle took three of the losses to overtime before the Blazers won.

During the 1996–97 season, Marleau was named captain of the Thunderbirds and led them to a second-place finish, behind the Portland Winter Hawks, in the Western Conference during the regular season. Marleau improved to 51 goals and 125 points, finishing top-three in the WHL in both categories. In the playoffs, Marleau led the Thunderbirds to the club&#x27;s first Western Conference Championship before the team bowed out in the WHL Finals to the eventual Memorial Cup runner-up Lethbridge Hurricanes in four games. Marleau finished second in the WHL&#x27;s Player of the Year voting, losing to Peter Schaefer of the Brandon Wheat Kings.

===San Jose Sharks (1997–2017)===
Following his second year of major junior, Marleau was drafted second overall by the San Jose Sharks in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, behind future Sharks teammate Joe Thornton, who was selected by the Boston Bruins. Although he struggled early in his career, Marleau learned to combine his excellent offensive talents with defensive prowess from former Sharks head coach Darryl Sutter.

Marleau was the youngest player in the 1997 draft class, and he debuted immediately at the start of the 1997–98 season. This conceptually makes him the youngest player to ever play in the NHL (in the modern draft era it would be impossible to debut at an earlier age than Marleau, as he was born on the last day of the draft cut-off, and debuted immediately in the first game of the next season).

With the departure of five-year captain Owen Nolan following the 2002–03 season, the Sharks employed a rotating captaincy for the first half of the 2003–04 season, seeing Mike Ricci, Vincent Damphousse and Alyn McCauley wear the &quot;C&quot; before the captaincy was permanently awarded to Marleau midway through the season. The new captain went on to match his previous personal high of 57 points from 2002 to 2003.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Marleau was inactive during the season but returned in 2005–06, having just signed a new three-year, US$12.5 million contract in August 2005, with a breakout season, becoming a point-per-game player with career-highs of 34 goals, 52 assists and 86 points in 82 games. New rule changes implemented by the NHL at the start of the first season back from the lockout that emphasized speed may have contributed to Marleau&#x27;s successful campaign. In a game against the Colorado Avalanche on March 19, 2006, Marleau scored two goals to acquire his 400th career point, edging him closer to Owen Nolan&#x27;s franchise mark of 451 points. Near the halfway point of the season, the Sharks acquired superstar Joe Thornton from the Boston Bruins. Thornton was also the only player picked ahead of Marleau in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. The Sharks were quickly considered a contender once acquiring &quot;Jumbo Joe&quot;, but were upset by the eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers in the second round. At the end of the season, Marleau was voted one of three finalists for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player, but lost out to Pavel Datsyuk of the Detroit Red Wings.
In 2006–07, Marleau passed Owen Nolan&#x27;s franchise marks for goals, assists and points all within a few weeks. On January 4, 2007, he passed Nolan&#x27;s 451-point mark with a goal and three assists in a win against the Detroit Red Wings. He then scored his 207th goal a week later on January 11 in a win against the Los Angeles Kings. Marleau continued at a point-per-game pace on the season with 78 points in 77 games, ranking second on the team in each category. In January 2007, Marleau played in his second NHL All-Star Game, scoring a goal. However, with high expectations for the playoffs, the Sharks were eliminated by Detroit in the second round in six games. In the off-season, Marleau signed a two-year, $12.6 million contract extension in August 2007 to keep him with the Sharks until the end of the 2009–10 season.

The following season, Marleau reached the 500-point mark for his career against the Phoenix Coyotes on November 14, 2007. However, his production for the season dipped to just 48 points, his lowest total since the 2001–02 season. In the 2008 playoffs, Marleau became the first NHL player since Brett Hull in 2002 to score shorthanded goals on consecutive days in the playoffs when he scored back-to-back shorthanded markers in Games 3 and 4 of the Western Conference Semi-final against the Dallas Stars. Despite his efforts, which included eight points in 13 games total for the playoffs, the Sharks were eliminated in the second round for the third consecutive year.

In the midst of a rejuvenated year for Marleau, overcoming his previous season&#x27;s dismal offensive output, he was selected to the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, replacing the injured Pavel Datsyuk.

In the summer of 2009, Marleau was removed as captain by head coach Todd McLellan. Rob Blake was named captain on September 30, 2009. Later in the year, while Blake was injured, Marleau was promoted to alternate captain, joining Joe Thornton and Dan Boyle.
On November 27, 2009, Marleau notched a hat-trick against the Edmonton Oilers. His third goal of the game was a shorthanded marker to tie the game 4–4; the Sharks finished the game with a score of 5–4 in a shootout. On December 1, 2009, Marleau played in his 900th career NHL game and notched two goals in a 5–2 win over the Ottawa Senators. On December 26, 2009, Marleau scored his 300th (and 301st) career goal in a 5–2 win over the Anaheim Ducks. On January 12, 2010, Marleau scored his 30th (and 31st) goal against the Phoenix Coyotes to become the fastest player in franchise history to score 30 goals in just 47 games. It was also the first time a Sharks player was the first NHL player to reach 30 goals. In the 2010 playoffs, Marleau scored the game-winning goal in Games 3 and 5 in the second round against the Detroit Red Wings, then scored five of the Sharks&#x27; seven goals in a sweep at the hands of the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks.

On June 24, 2010, Marleau chose to not test the free agent waters and instead re-signed with the Sharks to a four-year contract worth $27.6 million ($6.9 million per year).

On January 17, 2011, Marleau played his 1,000th career game and scored an early goal against the Phoenix Coyotes, becoming the third-quickest player to 1,000 career NHL games as measured by age, as well as the youngest player in NHL history to reach the milestone with the same franchise.

Once the 2012–13 NHL lockout had concluded, Marleau got off to one of the best offensive starts in NHL history. He scored two goals in each of San Jose&#x27;s first four games, then coming one goal short of five-straight multi-goal games, becoming only the second player in NHL history to open a season with four straight multi-goal games. The only other player to do it was Cy Denneny with the original Ottawa Senators in 1917–18. On March 10, 2013, against the Colorado Avalanche, Marleau scored his 400th career goal after failing to score in the previous six games. However, the Sharks lost the game 3–2. In the 2013 playoffs, Marleau scored his 57th career playoff goal, the second most of all active players, and 37th all-time. Marleau scored the most shots (41) and goals (5) with the Sharks in the postseason, and ended the season with 17 goals, 150 shots, and six, eight and 14 goals, assists and points, respectively, on powerplays, both ranking second on the team. Marleau also ranked third on the team with 31 points.

On January 24, 2014, Marleau signed a three-year contract extension with the Sharks through to the 2017 season. At the end of the 2013–14 season, Marleau ranked second in goals on the Sharks and was named a finalist for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for the second time, this time losing to Ryan O&#x27;Reilly.

On August 20, 2014, Sharks head coach Todd McLellan announced that the Sharks would start training camp for the 2014–15 season without a captain or alternates; he specified Marleau would have the opportunity to &quot;earn back&quot; a letter during camp.

On January 11, 2016, Marleau played in his 500th consecutive game.
On March 19, 2016, Marleau became the youngest player to play in his 1,400th NHL game, becoming 1 of only 36 players to accomplish this feat.

On January 23, 2017, against the Colorado Avalanche, Marleau scored four goals for the first time in his career, all in the third period, three of which came in 7:42.

On February 2, 2017, against the Vancouver Canucks, Marleau scored his 500th career goal, the 45th player in NHL history to do so, and only the 17th player to do so with his original team.

===Toronto Maple Leafs (2017–2019)===
Entering the open market for the first time in his career, Marleau was heavily courted by multiple teams, including the San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs, Anaheim Ducks and Dallas Stars. The prospect of leaving his team of nearly 20 years caused Marleau&#x27;s decision to be delayed, but after days of deliberation, on July 2, 2017, Marleau signed a three-year contract worth $6.25 million annually with the Maple Leafs. Marleau cited returning to Canada, as well as the young Maple Leafs projection as a Stanley Cup contender as reasons for signing in Toronto. Additionally, he cited the Maple Leafs&#x27; advanced sports science department as benefit of signing with the team (during free agency, Marleau was in the midst of one of the longest iron man streaks in NHL history). Marleau left San Jose holding nearly every offensive record in franchise history.

During his first season with Toronto, Marleau continued to reach notable career milestones. He played in his 1,500th career NHL game on October 18, 2017, becoming the 18th player in NHL history to reach 1,500 contests. Marleau recorded his 100th game-winning goal in a win over the Anaheim Ducks, becoming the eighth player to score 100 game-winning goals. He scored his 1,100th career point on December 12, becoming the 60th player in NHL history to reach the feat. Later during the season, he passed Maple Leafs&#x27; great Darryl Sittler with 1,122 career points, becoming 58th on all-time list. His 1,122nd point came in a win over the Buffalo Sabres on March 15, 2018.

On November 26, 2018, Marleau played in his 1,600th NHL game and became the 11th player to reach the mark, while also making an assist in the Maple Leafs&#x27; 4–2 win over the Boston Bruins.

On June 22, 2019, with the Maple Leafs in need of salary cap relief, Marleau was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes (along with a conditional first-round pick and a seventh-round pick in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft) in exchange for a sixth-round pick in the 2020 Draft. With the Hurricanes unable to convince Marleau to play for the team due to Marleau preferring to return to the West Coast, on June 27, Marleau was bought-out from the remaining year of his contract by the Hurricanes.

===Return to San Jose (2019–2020)===
On October 9, 2019, Marleau signed a one-year, $700,000 contract to return to the Sharks. The following day, he formally made his Sharks return against the Chicago Blackhawks; he scored two goals in a 5–4 victory, the Sharks&#x27; first of the 2019–20 season. Marleau received a standing ovation during his first home game on October 13; he recorded an assist in a 3–1 win over the Calgary Flames. On October 25, Marleau played his 1,500th game as a member of the San Jose Sharks, and became the seventh player in NHL history to play 1,500 games with one NHL franchise. On January 11, 2020, Marleau played in his 1,700th NHL game, becoming the fifth player in NHL history to reach the mark, and youngest to do so, as the Sharks defeated the Stars 2–1.

===Pittsburgh Penguins (2020)===
With the Sharks sitting outside a playoff spot approaching the trade deadline, many speculated that Marleau and fellow Sharks veteran Joe Thornton would be traded for a shot at winning the Stanley Cup. On February 24, 2020, Marleau was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a conditional 2021 third-round pick. His Cup ambitions would quickly end however as the Penguins were defeated in four games by the Montreal Canadiens, who were the lowest-seeded team to make the postseason.

===Third stint in San Jose (2020–2021)===
On October 13, 2020, Marleau returned to San Jose, signing a one-year contract. On April 19, 2021, in an away game against the Vegas Golden Knights, Marleau played his 1,768th NHL game, breaking the all-time NHL regular season games played record formerly held by Gordie Howe since 1961. At the time he surpassed Howe&#x27;s record, Marleau had missed only 31 games in his career, and had played with or against 37% of the players who had ever played in the NHL. He has played in all 82 regular season games in 11 separate seasons.

One game later, on April 21, Marleau became the fourth player in NHL history to record 900 consecutive games played.

After going unsigned during the 2021–22 season, Marleau announced his retirement on May 10, 2022. His number, 12, was retired by the Sharks on February 25, 2023, making him the first member of the San Jose Sharks franchise to receive this honor. 

==International play==





Marleau won a gold medal with Canada at the 2003 World Championships in Finland. Later, in the midst of the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Marleau joined Canada for two international tournaments, the 2004 World Cup and the 2005 World Championships, capturing a World Cup title by defeating Finland in the final and a silver medal at the World Championships, when his team lost to the Czech Republic 0:3. In the summer following his silver-medal effort with Canada, he was invited to the national team&#x27;s development camp for the 2006 Winter Olympics, but was omitted from the final roster.

On December 30, 2009, Marleau was selected to play for Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where he won a gold medal. Marleau also made the Canada roster for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, winning another gold medal.

==Personal life==
Patrick and his wife Christina have four sons. Marleau and his family reside in Florida. Marleau has an older sister, Denise, and an older brother, Richard.

<text>Baqir Jabr Al-Zubeidi (; born 1946), also known as Bayan Jabr Solagh (), is an Iraqi politician and former commander of the Badr Brigades who served as the Finance Minister of Iraq in the government of Nouri al-Maliki. He served as Minister of Interior, in charge of the police, in the Iraqi Transitional Government and was Minister of Housing and Reconstruction of the Iraqi Governing Council. He is also a senior member of the Shi&#x27;a United Iraqi Alliance as well as a leader in the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).

Born in 1946 to a Shia family in the Maysan Governorate, Jabr became a Shi&#x27;a activist while studying engineering at Baghdad University in the 1970s. He escaped to Iran amid former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein&#x27;s crackdown on Shi&#x27;a political groups and joined the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). He later headed SCIRI&#x27;s office in Syria. According to the Independent newspaper Jabr was a former commander of SCIRI&#x27;s militia, the Badr Brigades.

Under Jabr&#x27;s control, the Interior Ministry in 2006 was accused by the United Nations human rights chief in Iraq, John Pace, of executing and torturing to death hundreds of Iraqis every month.

On 3 January 2006, his sister was reported kidnapped from Baghdad by Iraqi insurgents. Parts of central Baghdad were locked down as police searched for the woman. She was released two weeks later after a ransom was paid by him.

<doc id="440408" wikidata="Q2646641" url="?curid=440408" title="Ali Allawi">
<text>Ali Abdul-Amir Allawi (Arabic: علي عبد الامير علاوي; born 1947) is an Iraqi politician and scholar. From May 2020 to August 2022, he ran as Iraq&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister.

He resigned from the post of finance minister on August 16, 2022 due to the deteriorating political situation in Iraq. He was Minister of Trade and Minister of Defense in the cabinet appointed by the Interim Iraq Governing Council from September 2003 until 2004, and subsequently Minister of Finance in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006.

==Background==
Allawi was born in Baghdad in 1947 but spent most of his life in exile. He first left Iraq in 1958. His family had been deeply involved in the politics of the kingdom but found themselves on the wrong side of the 14th of July revolution. After the Ba&#x27;ath Party came to power in 1968, Allawi knew a return to Iraq would be impossible. He opposed Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule from afar. He went to school in the United Kingdom and graduated from MIT in the United States with a BSc in Civil Engineering. After completing an MBA from Harvard University he worked in international development for the World Bank. He co-founded the Arab International Finance merchant bank in 1978. In 1992 he founded the Fisa Group which manages hedge funds. Between 1999 and 2002 he was a Senior Associate at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Later work==
In January 2007, &quot;The Independent&quot; published an article by Allawi outlining a blueprint for peace in Iraq. Allawi recommended devolution within Iraq, economic and political regional integration in the Middle East, and the setting up of independent boards to oversee reconstruction and security issues. The article was praised by &quot;Independent&quot; commentator Patrick Cockburn, who argued that it was &quot;by far the most perceptive analysis of the extent of the disaster in his country, and how it might best be resolved. It is in sharp contrast to the ill-thought-out maunderings of experts and officials devising fresh policies in the White House and Downing Street&quot;. Allawi has since written &quot;The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace&quot; and &quot;The Crisis of Islamic Civilization&quot;. Both books were well received by critics and the reading public. The New York Times Book Review called &quot;The Occupation of Iraq&quot; &quot;...the most comprehensive historical account of the disastrous aftermath of the American Invasion.

In October 2009, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy announced that his book &quot;The Crisis of Islamic Civilization&quot; was awarded the Silver Prize of its annual book prize. In December 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; named &quot;The Crisis of Islamic Civilization&quot; one of the Best Books of 2009. In a recent interview with &quot;The Diplomat&quot; he discussed his views on modern Islamic civilization. He considers that, as a result of the expansion of Western colonial powers and modernization over the last 200 years, Islamic civilization is fast losing its &quot;élan&quot; and has been reduced to two aspects - political and religious - while economic and cultural aspects no longer affect the Muslim world. Allawi was appointed a Visiting Research Professor at the National University of Singapore in 2013–14. 

In March 2014, Allawi&#x27;s biography of Faisal I of Iraq, published by Yale University Press, was released to wide critical acclaim.

<doc id="440414" wikidata="Q5326368" url="?curid=440414" title="Earl of Scarbrough">
<text>Earl of Scarbrough is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1690 for Richard Lumley, 2nd Viscount Lumley. He is best remembered as one of the Immortal Seven who invited William of Orange to invade England and depose his father-in-law James II. Lumley had already been created Baron Lumley, of Lumley Castle in the County of Durham, in 1681, and Viscount Lumley, of Lumley Castle in the County of Durham, in 1689. These titles are also in the Peerage of England. The title of Viscount Lumley, of Waterford, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1628 for his grandfather Sir Richard Lumley, who later fought as a Royalist in the Civil War.

Lord Scarbrough was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented East Grinstead and Arundel in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland. His younger brother, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Arundel and Lincolnshire. In 1723 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Saunderson, upon inheriting the estates of his cousin James Saunderson, 1st Earl Castleton. His son, the fourth Earl, served as Cofferer of the Household, as Deputy Earl Marshal of England and as Joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. Lord Scarbrough married Barbara Savile, sister and heiress of Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet. The latter bequeathed his substantial properties in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire to his nephew the Hon. Richard Lumley, younger son of Lord and Lady Scarbrough.

Scarbrough was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He represented Lincoln in Parliament. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother the aforementioned the Hon. Richard Lumley, the sixth Earl. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Lincoln. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl. He assumed the surname of Savile by Act of Parliament in 1797 in accordance with the will of his uncle Sir George Savile and inherited the Savile estates on his brother&#x27;s death. Lord Scarbrough was a clergyman. His son, the eighth Earl, represented Nottinghamshire and Nottinghamshire North in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire.

He was succeeded by his nephew, the eleventh Earl. He was the son of Brigadier General the Hon. Osbert Lumley, younger son of the ninth Earl. Lord Scarbrough represented Kingston upon Hull East and York in Parliament and served as Governor of Bombay. His son, the twelfth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 2004.

<text>Hoshyar Mahmud Mohammed Zebari, or simply Hoshyar Zebari (also spelled &quot;Hoshyar Zibari&quot;, Kurdish: &quot;Hişyar Zêbarî&quot;; born 23 September 1953) is an Iraqi - Kurdish politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister of the country in 2014 and as Minister of Finance until 2016. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2003 to 2014.

==Biography==

Zebari was born to a Kurdish Iraqi family in Aqrah, a city in Duhok Governorate, and grew up in Mosul. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the University of Jordan in 1976. He also obtained a Master of Arts in Sociology of Development from the University of Essex in the United Kingdom in 1980. While studying in Britain, he led the Kurdish Students Society in Europe and served as the chairman of the Overseas Student Committee from 1978 to 1980.

Zebari joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in 1979. In the 1980s, he fought as a member of the Peshmerga in the Iraqi–Kurdish conflict against the government of Saddam Hussein. He went on to become a member of the KDP&#x27;s Central Committee and its Political Bureau. In 1988, he was put in charge of its foreign relations and represented the party in the United States and the UK. In 1992, he was appointed a member of the executive committee of the Iraqi National Congress and was made part of its Presidential Council in 1999.

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Zebari was appointed a member of the Iraqi Governing Council. He was made foreign minister in September 2003. In July 2012, he said that al-Qaeda in Iraq members had gone to Syria, where the militants previously received support and weapons.

On 11 July 2014, Zebari was replaced as foreign minister by Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq&#x27;s deputy prime minister, who assumed the position in an acting capacity after Kurdish politicians withdrew from the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. On 8 September 2014, he was appointed a Deputy Prime Minister under the government of the new premier, Haider al-Abadi.

On 18 October 2014, Zebari was given the post of Minister of Finance of Iraq, while Rowsch Shaways was appointed the new Deputy Prime Minister in his place. On 21 September 2016, he was dismissed from his position as finance minister after losing a no-confidence motion over allegations of corruption.

In October 2017, Iraqi politicians and officials called on the government to investigate Zebari for nepotism after it was revealed that he had appointed his wife and seven of her family members to Iraqi embassies in various European countries.

Zebari tried to participate as a candidate in the presidential elections in 2022, but was banned by the Federal Supreme Court of Iraq over allegations of corruption against him dating back to 2016. He protested the decision, stating that no court had convicted him.

==Personal life==

Zebari is an Iraqi Kurd and a Sunni Muslim. His father was Mahmoud Agha Zebari, the chief of the Zebari clan, who was assassinated by the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 1981. Three of his older brothers were also killed by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. His family currently consists of three younger brothers and two younger sisters. He is also the uncle of Massoud Barzani, the former President of Iraqi Kurdistan. His late sister Hamael Mahmoud Agha Zebari had married Mustafa Barzani and gave birth to Massoud. He holds dual citizenship, being a national of both Iraq and Britain.

Zebari has been married twice. His second wife is Hana Abdul-Sattar al-Dulaimi, the daughter of Abdul-Sattar al-Dulaimi, who was an advisor to Saddam Hussein. His first wife was born in the town of Amedi in Iraq&#x27;s Duhok Governorate.

<doc id="440420" wikidata="Q6630086" url="?curid=440420" title="List of mutual-fund families in the United States">
<text>The following is a limited list of mutual-fund families in the United States. A family of mutual funds is a group of funds that are marketed under one or more brand names, usually having the same distributor (the company which handles selling and redeeming shares of the fund in transactions with investors), and investment advisor (which is usually a corporate cousin of the distributor).

There are several hundred families of registered mutual funds in the United States, some with a single fund and others offering dozens. Many fund families are units of a larger financial services company such as an asset manager, bank, stock brokerage, or insurance company. Additionally, multiple funds in a family can be part of the same corporate structure; that is, one underlying corporation or business trust may divide itself into more than one fund, each of which issues shares separately.

<doc id="440423" wikidata="Q456741" url="?curid=440423" title="Rick Nash">
<text>Richard Nash (born June 16, 1984) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who serves as the director of player development for the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). After being selected first overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by Columbus, he played 15 seasons in the NHL for the Blue Jackets, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins, and was selected to play in six National Hockey League All-Star Games.

Prior to turning professional, Nash was a highly regarded prospect with the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) where he spent two seasons, earning the Emms Family Award in 2001 as the League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. He began his NHL career with the Blue Jackets immediately following his draft, in 2002–03, and was nominated for the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year. In his second NHL season, Nash scored 41 goals to tie with Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk as winners of the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading goal-scorer. Nash is a six-time NHL All-Star and was also awarded the NHL Foundation Player Award in the 2008–09 season for his charitable work in the Columbus community. He is the Blue Jackets franchise career leader in goals, points, and games played. Widely considered the greatest Blue Jackets player of all time, Nash&#x27;s number 61 was retired by the franchise in 2022.

Internationally, Nash has represented Team Canada, with whom he has won one gold and two silver medals at the World Championships, and two gold medals at the Winter Olympics in 2010 and 2014. Additionally, he has represented Canada at the 2002 World Junior Championships, helping the team to a silver medal, and also competed for Canada in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

==Background==
Nash was raised in Brampton, Ontario, where he attended Brampton Centennial Secondary School. He played minor hockey in the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL), where he caught the attention of OHL scouts in 1999. He played in the 1998 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Marlboros minor ice hockey team.

==Playing career==
As a member of the London Knights for two seasons in the OHL, Rick Nash began his major junior career with 66 points in his first year, receiving the Emms Family Award as the League&#x27;s top rookie. The following season, he amassed 72 points in 54 games and was subsequently selected first overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets.

===Columbus Blue Jackets (2002–2012)===
The first NHL contract for Nash was negotiated minutes before the signing deadline by Gord Kirke. It was the most lucrative contract for an NHL rookie at the time, valued at 1.2 million USD per season plus bonuses and incentives which ranged from 8 to US$12 million.

Joining the Blue Jackets in 2002–03, Nash debuted on October 10, 2002, and scored a goal in a 2–1 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. He was the eighth number one overall pick to score a goal in his first game and the first to do so in his draft year since Mario Lemieux in 1984. That season, Nash was nominated for the Calder Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top rookie, but lost to defenseman Barret Jackman of the St. Louis Blues. He would, however, join Jackman on the NHL All-Rookie Team.

In Nash&#x27;s sophomore campaign, he improved his rookie goal total from 17 to 41, a career-high that tied Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk for the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy for most goals in the League. At 19 years of age, Nash was the youngest player in history to lead the League in goals. Recording 16 assists, Nash finished the year with 57 points.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Nash played for HC Davos of the Swiss Nationalliga A (NLA). He scored 26 goals and 46 points in 44 games and added 11 more points (nine goals and two assists) in 15 games in the NLA playoffs. Joined by fellow NHL-er Joe Thornton, Davos went on to win the Swiss Championship, as well as the 2004 Spengler Cup.

With the NHL set to resume play in 2005–06, the Blue Jackets re-signed Nash to a five-year, $27 million contract. The deal saw his annual salary increase each year, with $3.5 million the first season and $7 million in the last season of the contract for a $5.4 million average salary. Knee and ankle injuries, however, sidelined Nash for much of the first half of the season. Missing 28 games total, Nash was still named to Team Canada for the 2006 Olympics, shortly after being activated from the injured reserve. Upon returning from a disappointing seventh-place finish in Turin, Nash completed the season at a point-per-game pace with 54 points in 54 games.

In 2006–07, Nash matched his sophomore points total with 57, and was named to the Western Conference All-Star Team for the second time in his career. He was Columbus&#x27; lone representative both times. Nash scored the game-winning goal in the West win.

The following season, on January 17, 2008, Nash scored what many commentators called the &quot;goal of the year&quot; in the final minute versus the Phoenix Coyotes. Breaking a tied score, Nash deked around two defenders and the goaltender to score the eventual game-winner. Later, at the end of the season, the goal was nominated for an ESPY Award in the category of Best Play. Selected to his third All-Star Game in 2008 that season, Nash scored the quickest goal in All-Star Game history, just 12 seconds in and ended the game with a hat-trick.

Completing the season with 38 goals and 69 points, Nash nearly matched his personal best goals total and set a career high for points and assists. Shortly before the end of the season, on March 12, 2008, Nash was also named the fifth captain in Blue Jackets history, replacing the recently traded Adam Foote.

In the off-season, in May 2008, Nash was named the cover athlete and spokesman for the &quot;NHL 2K9&quot; video game. Going into the 2008–09 campaign, the Blue Jackets had gone without a playoff appearance in franchise history. Led by the newly appointed captain Nash and bolstered by rookie goaltender Steve Mason, the Blue Jackets finished the season as the seventh seed in the Western Conference to earn a post-season berth against division-rival the Detroit Red Wings. The series was preceded by an 8–2 rout over the Red Wings on March 7, 2009, a game in which Nash scored three unassisted goals. According to the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;, citing the Elias Sports Bureau, the last player to score three goals unassisted was Maurice Richard (who scored four) against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden on March 14, 1948. Despite the convincing victory late in the season, the Blue Jackets were swept by the Red Wings in four games.
In addition to leading the Blue Jackets to the playoffs, Nash had a career season with 79 points, in addition to scoring 40 goals for the first time since 2003–04. In the off-season, on July 3, 2009, Nash signed an eight-year contract extension with the Blue Jackets worth $62.4 million set to take effect in 2010–11.

As the 2011–12 season began to unfold, Columbus recorded a dismal 2–12–1 record, the worst start to an NHL season by any team in 19 years. With the team struggling, rumors began circulating that the Blue Jackets were contemplating trading Nash as a solution to their on-ice woes. While Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson stated publicly that he had had no discussions regarding a Nash deal, other teams had indeed inquired about his availability. When asked about it, Nash stated that if the franchise felt it could improve itself by dealing him, he would be willing to waive his no-trade clause in order to get the deal done. Though Howson had previously maintained that he had no intention of trading Nash, two weeks before the trade deadline, he stated in the press that the team was open to all options and they were willing to listen to trade proposals for Nash, despite not actively shopping him. Speculation was that in return for Nash the Blue Jackets would ask for a top six forward, a top prospect and a first-round draft pick.

Trade speculation continued on into the summer with no deal imminent. While Howson claimed he merely wanted to receive &quot;market value&quot; in any deal for Nash, there was speculation that his asking price was too high for many rival NHL GMs to consider. Columbus eventually found a trade partner in the New York Rangers. Nash, along with Steven Delisle and a conditional third-round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, were traded to the Rangers for Artem Anisimov, Brandon Dubinsky, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick.

===New York Rangers (2012–2018)===
Nash signed a contract to play with HC Davos again during the 2012–13 NHL lockout. In late September 2012, while playing for Davos, Nash injured his shoulder and left the game.

Nash had a successful first regular season with the Rangers, scoring 21 goals and 21 assists for 42 points in 44 games played in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season. However, in the playoffs, Nash underwhelmed with only one goal and four assists in 12 playoff games.

Nash opened the 2013–14 season well, with three assists in two games. But on October 8, 2013, in a game against the San Jose Sharks, Nash suffered a concussion from a hit by Brad Stuart, which forced him to miss 17 games. On November 21, Nash scored his first goal of the season in a 3–2 win against the Dallas Stars. He would finish the season with a solid goal total of 26 in 65 games, but with only 13 assists, his 39 points tied a career low. Nash struggled mightily in the playoffs for the second straight year, scoring only three goals in 25 playoff games. Despite his low offensive production, however, he was solid defensively throughout, and the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals, ultimately losing in five games to the Los Angeles Kings in a series in which all the games were close decisions.

Nash had a superstar season in 2014–15 scoring a career-high 42 goals (third in the NHL behind Steven Stamkos with 43 and Alexander Ovechkin with 53) and 27 assists. Nash&#x27;s production also improved during the 2015 playoffs, as he scored five goals and nine assists (14 points) in 19 games as the Rangers fell to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a hard-fought seven-game Eastern Conference Finals series.

Nash&#x27;s performance declined at the start of the 2015–16 season as he struggled to recapture his scoring pace from the previous season. This was further exacerbated by muscle spasms that caused Nash to miss 22 games. Despite being involved in trade rumors, few teams seemed to be interested in Rick Nash and his $7.9 million cap hit. Nash scored a career-low 15 goals, going with 21 assists for a career-low 36 points. He then recorded two goals and two assists in New York&#x27;s five-game opening round loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs.

On October 11, 2016 Nash was named an alternate captain for the New York Rangers, joining Daniel Girardi, Marc Staal, and Derek Stepan along with captain Ryan McDonagh. On November 8, 2016, Nash scored his 400th goal in a 5–3 loss against the Vancouver Canucks. Nash again missed several games during the 2016–17 season, this time with a nagging groin injury. He still managed to score 23 goals and 15 assists for 38 points, in 67 games. Nash&#x27;s production continued to improve during the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs. He recorded two goals and one assist in the Rangers six-game opening-round victory over the Montreal Canadiens.

On October 26, 2017, Nash skated in his 1,000th NHL career game, which resulted in a 5–2 win over the Arizona Coyotes. He became the 312th player in NHL history to play at least 1,000 career games.

===Boston Bruins (2018)===
During the 2017–18 season, the Rangers struggled relative to their results from past seasons. On February 8, 2018, the team released a letter to fans that signaled intentions to begin a rebuild, to which rumors of a Nash trade began to swirl, as he was in the last year of his contract. On February 25, 2018, one day before the trade deadline, Nash was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Ryan Spooner, Matt Beleskey, prospect Ryan Lindgren, a 2018 first-round pick (which became Jacob Bernard-Docker), and a 2019 seventh-round pick (which became Massimo Rizzo). Rick Nash&#x27;s first goal as a Bruin, and his 800th career point, came on February 27, 2018, in a 4–3 overtime Bruins home ice win over the Carolina Hurricanes. Nash would go on to play 23 games for the Bruins, and suffered a concussion in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, after a hit from Cedric Paquette.

On January 11, 2019, at age 34, due to unresolved symptoms from a concussion sustained in March 2018, Nash was forced to retire from professional hockey after playing 1,060 career games spanning over 15 seasons.

==International play==




In Nash&#x27;s second junior season, he was chosen to play for Team Canada&#x27;s junior squad in the 2002 World Junior Championships, scoring three points in a silver medal effort.

Nash would make his senior international debut for Team Canada at the 2005 World Championship, leading the tournament in goals while earning his second silver medal.

In 2006, shortly after returning from an injury, he was selected to play on Team Canada&#x27;s Olympic team, but managed just one point in a disappointing seventh-place finish.

The following year, Nash captured his first gold medal with Team Canada at the 2007 World Championship in a 4–2 victory over Finland in Moscow. Scoring two goals in the gold medal game against Finland and 11 points total, Nash was named to the tournament All-Star Team and earned MVP honours.

Nash appeared in his third World Championship in 2008, but failed to repeat as gold medal champion with Canada, earning silver. In the championship game against Russia, Nash attempted to clear the puck in overtime, but accidentally shot it over the glass, resulting a delay of game penalty. On the powerplay, Russia capitalized, defeating Canada 5–4. Despite his misplay, Nash was named to the tournament All-Star Team for the second consecutive year, finishing with 13 points.

On December 30, 2009, Nash was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. After starting the tournament on Sidney Crosby&#x27;s wing, he was switched to a line with Mike Richards and Jonathan Toews, who was named Best Forward. Nash earned his first Olympic medal in the tournament as Team Canada went on to win gold.

Nash was named captain of Team Canada for the 2011 IIHF World Championship. Canada finished fifth in the tournament.

Rick Nash won his second gold medal with Team Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

<text>Mohammad Tofiq Rahim (Kurdish: محه‌مه‌د تۆفیق ره‌حیم) (born 1953) is an Iraqi Kurdish politician. Born in Sulaimaniyah city in 1953, Rahim is currently the secretary of the internal departments of Iraqi Kurdistan&#x27;s largest opposition grouping Movement for Change.

==Early life==
Rahim, popularly known as Hama Tofiq, was born in the city of Sulaimaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan in 1953. After initial education in Sulaimaniyah, Rahim attended Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. He subsequently travelled to France and the United Kingdom where he completed his graduate studies at the Paris-Sorbonne University and the University of Bath. He was active in Kurdish student politics from an early age and joined the Peshmerga forces immediately upon his return to Kurdistan.

==Career at the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan==
Mohammad Tofiq Rahim returned to Kurdistan in 1979. He had been active in Kurdish politics as a member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and quickly rose to high leadership as Political bureau member with responsibility for external relations, in part due to his command of several European languages. He has a passion for languages and as well as his native Kurdish he is known to speak Arabic, English, French and German fluently with a working knowledge of the Turkish language. He was the founding editor of the party&#x27;s chief newspaper Kurdistani Nwe and helped organise the 1991 uprising in which the Kurds overthrew Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Baathist regime. Rahim was elected as the region&#x27;s first deputy speaker of parliament. He subsequently held several Kurdistan Regional Government posts including minister of humanitarian resources (the nascent government&#x27;s foreign office), Minister of Justice, Minister of Transportation and Minister of Planning.

In September 2003, after the toppling of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime Rahim was appointed Minister of Industry and Mines in the cabinet appointed by the Interim Iraq Governing Council.

In 2006 Rahim resigned from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan citing endemic corruption and nepotism.

==Leadership - Movement for Change==

After his resignation from the PUK, Rahim was a founding member of the Movement for Change under the leadership of Nawshirwan Mustafa. He was initially the movement&#x27;s official spokesman and is now responsible for the external relations of the organisation. He was a key campaigner in the Change lists 2009 election campaign in Sulaimaniyah in which Change took a quarter of the region&#x27;s parliamentary seats and swept Sulaimaniyah Governorate.

<doc id="440425" wikidata="Q58914" url="?curid=440425" title="Penrose stairs">
<text>The Penrose stairs or Penrose steps, also dubbed the impossible staircase, is an impossible object created by Oscar Reutersvärd in 1937 and later independently discovered and made popular by Lionel Penrose and his son Roger Penrose. A variation on the Penrose triangle, it is a two-dimensional depiction of a staircase in which the stairs make four 90-degree turns as they ascend or descend yet form a continuous loop, so that a person could climb them forever and never get any higher. This is clearly impossible in three-dimensional Euclidean geometry but possible in some non-Euclidean geometry like in nil geometry.

The &quot;continuous staircase&quot; was first presented in an article that the Penroses wrote in 1959, based on the so-called &quot;triangle of Penrose&quot; published by Roger Penrose in the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot; in 1958. M.C. Escher then discovered the Penrose stairs in the following year and made his now famous lithograph &quot;Klimmen en dalen&quot; (&quot;Ascending and Descending&quot;) in March 1960. Penrose and Escher were informed of each other&#x27;s work that same year. Escher developed the theme further in his print &quot;Waterval&quot; (&quot;Waterfall&quot;), which appeared in 1961.

In their original article the Penroses noted that &quot;each part of the structure is acceptable as representing a flight of steps but the connections are such that the picture, as a whole, is inconsistent: the steps continually descend in a clockwise direction.&quot;

==History of discovery==

=== The Penroses ===

Escher, in the 1950s, had not yet drawn any impossible stairs and was not aware of their existence. Roger Penrose had been introduced to Escher&#x27;s work at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam in 1954. He was &quot;absolutely spellbound&quot; by Escher&#x27;s work, and on his journey back to England he decided to produce something &quot;impossible&quot; on his own. After experimenting with various designs of bars overlying each other he finally arrived at the impossible triangle. Roger showed his drawings to his father, who immediately produced several variants, including the impossible flight of stairs. They wanted to publish their findings but did not know in what field the subject belonged. Because Lionel Penrose knew the editor of the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot; and convinced him to publish their short manuscript, the finding was finally presented as a psychological subject. After the publication in 1958 the Penroses sent a copy of the article to Escher as a token of their esteem.

While the Penroses credited Escher in their article, Escher noted in a letter to his son in January 1960 that he was:
Escher was captivated by the endless stairs and subsequently wrote a letter to the Penroses in April 1960:
At a conference in Rome in 1985, Roger Penrose said that he had been greatly inspired by Escher&#x27;s work when he and his father discovered both the Penrose tribar structure (that is, the Penrose triangle) and the continuous steps.

=== Oscar Reutersvärd ===
The staircase design had been discovered previously by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd, but neither Penrose nor Escher was aware of his designs. Inspired by a radio programme on Mozart&#x27;s method of composition—described as &quot;creative automatism&quot;; that is, each creative idea written down inspired a new idea—Reutersvärd started to draw a series of impossible objects on a journey from Stockholm to Paris in 1950 in the same &quot;unconscious, automatic&quot; way. He did not realize that his figure was a continuous flight of stairs while drawing, but the process enabled him to trace his increasingly complex designs step by step. When M.C. Escher&#x27;s &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot; was sent to Reutersvärd in 1961, he was impressed but didn&#x27;t like the irregularities of the stairs (). Throughout the 1960s, Reutersvärd sent several letters to Escher to express his admiration for his work, but the Dutch artist failed to respond. Roger Penrose only discovered Reutersvärd&#x27;s work in 1984.

==Escherian Stairwell==
&quot;The Escherian Stairwell&quot; is a viral video based on the Penrose stairs illusion. The video, filmed at Rochester Institute of Technology by Michael Lacanilao, was edited to create a seemingly cyclic stairwell such that if someone walks in either direction, they will end up where they started. The video claims that the stairwell, whose name evokes M.C. Escher&#x27;s impossible objects, was built in the 1960s by the fictitious architect Rafael Nelson Aboganda. The video was revealed to be an Internet hoax, as individuals have travelled to Rochester Institute of Technology to view the staircase.

== In popular culture ==
*People walking along Penrose stairs feature in the video of Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Some People&quot;. 
*The Penrose stairs appeared twice in the movie &quot;Inception&quot;. This paradoxical illusion can only be realized in the dream worlds of the film. In the film, the hero descends the stairs fleeing from a guard. In the real world, the hero should always be in front of the villain throughout this chase. However, in the case of the Penrose stairs the hero descends another flight of stairs to catch up to the antagonist and catch him unaware.
*The cover of the 2011 album &quot;Angles&quot; by American rock band The Strokes depicts a complex set of Penrose stairs.
*In their 2015 single called &quot;Greek Tragedy,&quot; English rock band The Wombats mentions the Penrose steps.

<text>Hashim Abderrahman al-Shibli (Arabic: ) is an Iraqi politician from Baghdad who was the Iraqi Justice Minister from 2006 to 2007 in the government of Nouri al-Maliki. A Sunni Arab, he was elected to the National Assembly of Iraq in December 2005 on the secular Iraqi National List coalition.

== Biography ==
A lawyer, a Sunni Muslim, and a member of the National Democratic Party, Hashim Abderrahman al-Shibli was appointed Minister of Justice in September 2003. In 2005, he was nominated to the post of Human Rights Minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government which he turned down, saying he wasn&#x27;t consulted before being nominated. In May 2006, he was appointed Minister of Justice in the Iraqi Governing Council.

Shibli is also the chairman of the government committee charged with implementing the articles of the Constitution of Iraq that relate to Kirkuk&#x27;s status.

Following the leaking of a videotape of the execution of Saddam Hussein, with the detention on January 3, 2007 of a guard under al-Shibli&#x27;s ministry, suspicions have arisen that his ministry may have intended to inflame sectarian tensions. He resigned from his post at March 31, 2007, citing political differences with the Prime Minister al-Maliki over the execution of Saddam Hussein and with the Iraqi National List over the future of Kirkuk. However a spokesman for the government said his inability to control abuse at prisons meant he was going to be replaced in a forthcoming reshuffle.

<doc id="440428" wikidata="Q1329765" url="?curid=440428" title="Jarlsberg cheese">
<text>Jarlsberg ( , ) is a mild cheese made from cow&#x27;s milk, with large, regular eyes, originating from Jarlsberg, Norway. It is produced in Norway, as well as in Ireland and the US state of Ohio, licensed from Norwegian dairy producers. It is classified as a Swiss-type cheese.
==Description==
Jarlsberg cheese has a yellow wax rind (outer layer) and a semi-firm yellow interior. It is a mild, buttery cheese. The flavour has been described as &quot;clean and rich, with a slightly sweet and nutty flavour&quot;. It is an all-purpose cheese, used for both cooking and eating as a snack. It has a characteristic smooth, shiny-yellow body, and a creamy, supple texture. It is aged a minimum of three months and is distinguished by medium to large holes. Some variations are aged a minimum of 9, 12 or 15 months. It is usually produced in wheels with an approximate diameter of and a height of . The characteristic holes or &quot;eyes&quot; are the result of the action of the bacteria &quot;Propionibacterium freudenreichii&quot; which naturally occurs in milk and is added back into the cheese during production according to a closely guarded secret formula.

==History==
The history of this cheese can be traced back to the middle 1850s. Anders Larsen Bakke (1815–1899), a farmer and pioneer in Norway&#x27;s dairy industry, produced cheese in the village of Våle in what was then the county of Jarlsberg and Larviks Amt (now Vestfold), south of Oslo. The cheese shares similarities with Emmental, introduced to Vestfold by Swiss cheese makers during the 1830s. The cheese was first noted in the annual county report of Jarlsberg and Larviks Amt in 1855. After several years of popularity marked by a large volume of production Jarlsberg disappeared from the market.

Modern Jarlsberg cheese was developed in 1956 by Ole Martin Ystgaard of the Dairy Institute at the Agricultural University of Norway. Ystgaard&#x27;s interest was sparked by the thesis of a dairy sciences student, Per Sakshaug, on the cheese historically made in Vestfold. It was named for a Norwegian nobleman, Count Wedel Jarlsberg, who owned land near Oslo in an area where an earlier version of the cheese was produced in the early 1800s, or for the eponymous county. The recipe was developed from formulae originating with Swiss cheesemakers who moved to Norway at that time.

==Production and distribution==

&quot;Jarlsberg&quot; is a trademark first registered by Tine SA in 1972, and the exact nature and formula for the process of making Jarlsberg cheese is a trade secret. The largest producer of Jarlsberg cheese is Tine SA. Tine is the largest Norwegian dairy product cooperative. Jarlsberg cheese accounts for 80% of Tine&#x27;s total exports. Tine&#x27;s United States subsidiary, Norseland, has sold 150 million wheels of Jarlsberg cheese in the U.S. .

Jarlsberg cheese was introduced in the United States in 1964. Imports to the U.S. in 1965 were . Since 1979 imports to the U.S. have been limited to .

<text>Oakley, Inc. is an American company headquartered in Foothill Ranch, California, which is an autonomous subsidiary of Luxottica. The company designs, develops and manufactures sports performance equipment and lifestyle pieces including sunglasses, safety glasses, eyeglasses, sports visors, ski/snowboard goggles, watches, apparel, backpacks, shoes, optical frames, and other accessories. Most items are designed in house at their head office, but some countries hold exclusive designs relevant to their market. Oakley currently holds more than 600 patents for eyewear, materials, and performance gear.

==History==

Oakley was started by Jim Jannard in 1975 in his garage with an initial investment of $300. The name &quot;Oakley&quot; came from Jim&#x27;s English Setter, &quot;Oakley Anne&quot;. Jannard began by selling what he called &#x27;The Oakley Grip&#x27; out of the back of his car at motocross events. His motorcycle grips were unlike other grips available at the time. The material is still used to make the earsocks on Oakley glasses, and many of the nose pieces and now the bands of their watches. Oakley went on to produce number plates, gloves, grips, elbow guards, chin guards, and goggles for the BMX and motocross communities.

In 1980, Jannard released a pair of goggles called the O-Frame. With the &#x27;Oakley&#x27; logo present on the strap, the brand garnered increasing recognition and prominence throughout the sports industry. In 1983, Oakley began selling ski goggles.

The first Oakley sunglasses, Factory Pilot Eyeshades, were sport-oriented, resembling goggles and were released in 1984. These were followed in 1985 by the Oakley Frogskin, a casual sunglass style that was made in Japan.

The company went public in 1995, raising $230 million.

In early 1996, Oakley had a pricing dispute with Italian company Luxottica, the world&#x27;s largest eyewear manufacturers and retailers. Luxottica stopped carrying Oakley&#x27;s products in their stores, including Sunglass Hut, and Oakley&#x27;s stock market value declined 33%.

In 2001, Oakley bought Iacon, Inc., operator of mall-based sunglasses stores Sunglass Designs, Sporting Eyes, and Occhiali da Sole.

Oakley signed a four-year agreement to manufacture eyewear designed by themselves and Fox Racing in September 2004.

Starting in 2004, Jannard bought large quantities of Oakley stock: $2 million in 2004, $16 million in 2005, and $4.6 million in early 2006, bringing his personal stake in the company to 63%.

In 2006, Oakley acquired the Oliver Peoples group, a manufacturer of high-end fashion branded eyewear (under the Oliver Peoples, Mosley Tribes, and Paul Smith brands) for $55.7m, and Optical Shop of Aspen, a luxury eyewear retailer with fourteen stores. Later in 2006, Oakley acquired Eye Safety Systems, Inc. (ESS), another major manufacturer of tactical eye protection, for US$110m.

On June 21, 2007, Luxottica announced a plan to purchase Oakley in a cash deal worth $2.1 billion, paying a 16% premium over the extant share price. The deal was completed on November 15, 2007, making Oakley part of a portfolio that includes brands such as Ray-Ban, Persol, and Vogue. After the sale, founder James Jannard went on to found Red Digital Cinema. Luxottica&#x27;s acquisition of Oakley was criticized as a potential violation of antitrust laws. This move also moved more of Oakley&#x27;s manufacturing out of the US and portions of its sunglasses frames and lenses began to be produced in China and Italy.

During the preparations for the ultimately successful rescue of thirty-three miners trapped for ten weeks in a Chilean mine in October 2010, a journalist covering the story contacted Oakley about donating sunglasses to the rescue effort, aware that the miners would need eye protection after having spent weeks in darkness. Oakley donated 35 pairs of its Radar sports glasses, fitted with specially selected tints.
Oakley sponsored members of the US Olympic Team in 2012, and that same year, extended the partnership through 2020. 

In August 2013, Oakley sold its REVO brand to Sequential Brands for $20m. In November 2013, Oakley signed a multi-year deal with Scuderia Ferrari.

In September 2015, Oakley shut down the website of its outlet arm Oakley Vault, while continuing its brick and mortar retail presence of the brand. 

In March 2021, Aston Martin F1 Team announced a partnership with Oakley.

==Design==

Most of Oakley&#x27;s technological designs, fashion pieces, gear, etc. were developed with extensive athlete input and testing in the field – including extreme conditions. Oakley also maintains US Standard Issue, which provides U.S. military and law enforcement eye protection. Oakley M Frame sunglasses are included as part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL), and have been assigned a National Stock Number (NSN) for ordering through military supply channels. The company has also built at least one &#x27;golf hovercraft&#x27;, demonstrated as an all terrain replacement for conventional golf carts. This hovercraft was created for marketing purposes, in partnership with the professional golfer, Bubba Watson. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Oakley released the MSK3 mask, which featured an innovative design to prevent eyewear fogging.

<text>In ancient Greece, a phratry (, derived from ) was a group containing citizens in some city-states. Their existence is known in most Ionian cities and in Athens and it is thought that they existed elsewhere as well. Almost nothing is known about the functions and responsibilities of phratries outside Attica (the area around Athens). Within Athens, they played a prominent role in social and religious life, particularly in the major festival called the Apatouria. They played an important role in determining eligibility for Athenian citizenship and all citizens (with very few exceptions) and only citizens were enrolled in phratries. Particularly in anthropology, the term is also applied to similar descent groups of multiple clans in other societies.

==History==
===Origins and etymology===
The origins of the phratry in ancient Greece are unknown. It is possible that they are Ionian in origin and that their presence in Athens stems from a known migration from Ionia in the late Mycenaean period. This was the origin explanation favored by many of the classical Athenians, including Aristotle. Some scholars also favor this explanation because phratries are known to have been present in most (but not all) of the Ionian city-states, as was the major phratry festival, the Apatouria. However, almost nothing is known about the functions or prominence of the Apatouria and the phratries in Ionian city-states. It is therefore possible that they functioned differently from the Athenian phratries and perhaps even emerged separately. The linguistic origins of the word &quot;phratry&quot; are quite old and date back to the Indo-European period, thus giving rise to a second origin theory for phratries: that they date back to early antiquity and originated not in Ionia but elsewhere in Greece. The term &quot;phratry&quot; itself is quite similar to a number of words for &quot;brother&quot; in languages derived from Indo-European which makes it more plausible that institutions named phratries emerged independently in Attica (where Athens is) and Ionia. The existence of the Apatouria in both Ionia and Athens complicates the second theory of origin somewhat, but at present scholars are highly uncertain about how phratries actually emerged.
===Archaic period===
What little we do know about phratries from before the 5th century BCE is drawn primarily from Homer and from Draco&#x27;s law of homicide, which probably dates to about 620 BCE. Homer mentions phratries numerous times in his works, although never in any detail. However, their casual mention heavily implies that they were well-established by Homer&#x27;s time. Draco&#x27;s law of homicide, from Athens, details who can pardon a murderer. First, the immediate family of the murderer&#x27;s victim has the right to pardon the murderer. If there is no immediate family, the power then passes to the extended family. If the victim also has no extended family, then the power to pardon the murderer passes to members of the victim&#x27;s phratry. Since there is no further instruction on what happens if the victim was not in a phratry, scholars have generally interpreted this as meaning that, as early as the 7th century BCE, all Athenian citizens were members of a phratry. Draco&#x27;s law of homicide also states that the ten most aristocratic of the phratry members would be the ones to make the decision, implying that, at this early stage in Athenian history, the phratries were dominated by the aristocratic class. This would reflect the aristocratic dominance of the broader city-state at this time.

Cleisthenes undertook a major reorganization of Athenian institutions in 508 BCE. In general, he made Athens more democratic and less aristocratic. It is known that he reorganized and reconstituted the phylai and created the demes, two other groups to which all Athenian citizens belonged. Whether or not he reformed the phratries is unknown. One leading scholar in the field, S.D. Lambert, speculates that the phratries were not involved in the military or political life or responsibilities of citizenship and that Cleisthenes only reorganized institutions in those areas. He further speculates that any change that did occur in the phratries was a reaction to the reorganization of other Athenian institutions rather than a reform undertaken directly by Cleisthenes.
===Classical period===
Phratries likely reached their peak importance in Athens between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE, when we have the most extant records of them. In this time, they played a prominent role in Greek religious and social life. The number of phratries that existed during this period is unknown. The names of nine phratries are known and there are thought to have been at least thirty. There could have been as many as 140 phratries, the same as the number of demes in that period. Scholarly estimates place the Athenian citizen male population at between 20,000 and 30,000 in the 4th century BCE, which could mean phratries were as large as 1,000 adult males per phratry or as small as 140 adult males per phratry. It is also likely that different phratries were of different size and that phratries split or merged as demographic changes within them required.

With very limited exceptions, membership in a phratry was limited to adult male citizens who were descended from adult male citizen members of that phratry. The sole known exceptions were naturalized citizens, who were usually enrolled in a phratry upon gaining Athenian citizenship. Citizenship and membership were main concerns for phratries in this period and surviving texts deal extensively with questions around membership. This is likely because the qualifications for Athenian citizenship were based upon descent from Athenian citizen fathers (and later, also mothers) and phratries were one of only two institutions that kept track of descent (the other being demes).

In 451 BCE, Pericles altered the qualifications for citizenship to require a citizen to have two Athenian parents rather than just Athenian citizen fathers. As phratries were the only institutions keeping track of the parentage of females (demes concerned themselves with males only), this law elevated concern with citizenship and membership in phratries. It seems that phratries altered their qualifications for membership to match the new citizenship requirements, but it is likely that the change was phratry-by-phratry rather than an explicit part of the new citizenship law. Phratries became even more concerned with citizenship and parentage during the Peloponnesian War, when widespread migration, military service and premature death heightened the difficulty of record keeping. The biggest cache of surviving documents, the decrees of a phratry called the Demotionodai centered in a town called Decelea in northern Attica, date from this period and almost exclusively discuss membership qualifications and introduction procedures.
====Phratry festivals====
The biggest, most prominent and most important phratry festival was the Apatouria, a three day festival during the Athenian month of Pyanepsion. This would place the festival during October or November, depending on the year. One of the biggest festivals of the year in Athens, the Apatouria contained many different rituals within it and likely differed somewhat depending on the phratry one was a member of. Among the most important parts of the festival were the gamelia, the meion and the koureion. The gamelia was the process by which a phratry member introduced their new wife to the phratry, who welcomed and accepted her. Although females did not become phratry members, the phratry did have some supervision over the females in the households of adult male phratry members. The gamelia also gained additional importance after Pericles&#x27; new citizenship law of 451 BCE as it created a record of the history and qualifications of the wives of citizens and thus the eligibility for citizenship of their offspring.
====Meion====
The meion was the ceremony in which phratry members first introduced their male children to the phratry. It is unknown whether the meion took place in every phratry, but there seems to have been no fixed rule as to when a phratry member should submit his child for the meion ceremony. The koureion was the second introduction of the male offspring to the phratry and probably occurred during adolescence. After undergoing the koureion, a male was considered a full member of the phratry. At both the meion and koureion, phratry members would have had the opportunity to object to the induction of the new member if they believed his parentage was insufficient. It is unclear whether the scrutiny procedure that followed was standard for every new member or only undertaken if someone objected. It also seems that the specific procedure of the meion, koureion, and scrutiny varied by phratry. There was also an induction ceremony for females, although the details are unknown. It is also unknown whether that was a universal ceremony, or whether it was only undertaken by some phratries or some families.

====Procedures and institutions====
The Demotionodai decrees detail the scrutiny procedure for that phratry in the decades following the Peloponnesian War. Potential inductees and the person who introduced them for scrutiny would be fined by the phratry if the inductee was deemed to not be eligible for phratry membership. The Demotionodai decrees also state that the scrutiny of a candidate for membership should be publicized in both Athens and Decelea, probably as a result of significant phratry migration from Decelea to Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The phratry was known to operate out of a barber shop in Athens where phratry members congregated. The procedures are also very concerned with the introduction of candidates for phratry membership who do not have parents to vouch for their eligibility. This was likely a major concern of the period due to heavy death brought on both by plague and war and was probably of particular concern for the Demotionodai phratry because of its center in Decelea, a frontier area occupied by Sparta during the war.

The Demotionodai decrees also make clear that there were elected phratry officers, led by an elected patriarch. This would mark a democratic change from the aristocratic phratry leadership as implied in Draco&#x27;s law centuries earlier and would mirror democratic changes in broader Athenian society. The decrees also make clear that the phratry had an independent treasury, as there were fines levied on candidates for membership who were refused membership after the scrutiny procedure. It is thought that both the elected leadership and institutional finances were common to other phratries as well and there are records of the phratries themselves acting as lending agents and landlords.

The only reliable extant records of citizens without phratry membership also date to around the time of the Peloponnesian War. Citizenship was granted to the Plataeans in 427 BCE, the Samians in 405/4 BCE and the Heroes of Phyle in 401/0 BCE, but none of these grants included enrolment in a phratry. The Plataeans were enrolled in demes, but the Samians and Heroes of Phyle were not. This suggests that these groups had somewhat limited citizenship, as membership in a phratry and deme were prerequisites to most of the privileges and duties of citizenship. It is unknown whether there were other grants of citizenship to individuals or groups that did not include phratry membership, but it is thought to have been uncommon and there are no other reliable records of citizens, naturalized or not, who were not enrolled in phratries.

===Decline===
Around 250 BCE, the extant references to phratries decrease quite a bit. From 250 BCE to 150 BCE the only surviving references to phratries are citizenship grants that enroll new citizens in a phratry, but it is not clear whether that means that phratries were still heavily active. Those same new citizens were also enrolled in phylai, which had been essentially dormant for centuries, although they technically still existed. After 150 BCE, citizenship grants no longer include enrollment in phratries, demes or phylai. Scholars believe that the decline of phratries is related to the decline in importance of Athenian citizenship. As Athens lost both its empire and its independence, the importance of tightly controlling Athenian citizenship and the benefits associated with citizenship heavily decreased. As phratries were tightly linked to eligibility for citizenship and participation in the duties of citizenship, it is thought that they declined as a result. Another related and complementary theory is that citizenship became more tightly linked to military service rather than descent, which had a similar effect on the phratries and their ceremonies of scrutiny and induction.

<doc id="440435" wikidata="Q4696872" url="?curid=440435" title="Aiham Alsammarae">
<text>Aiham Alsammarae (also spelled Aiham Al-Sammarae; ; born 5 July 1951) is a nationalistic, Sunni Muslim, Iraqi politician who served as Minister of Electricity from August 2003 until May 2005. He has been an active member of the Iraqi National List (headed by Iyad Allawi) and has fought hard for political reconciliation among Iraq&#x27;s political parties as well as against the policy of de-Ba&#x27;athification, since his resignation as Minister of Electricity. Previously, he was a prominent member of the Iraqi Opposition and lived in exile in the United States for over 30 years.

==Family, childhood, and education==
Alsammarae was born on 5 July 1951 to a prominent Sunni Muslim family in Baghdad, Iraq, the second youngest of 13 children. His father, Jasim, was born and raised in Samarra. He later founded one of Iraq&#x27;s largest construction companies. From a young age, Alsammarae was intimately familiar with Iraqi politics due to his family&#x27;s presence in this sphere. Many of his close relatives served as ambassadors, cabinet advisors, and members of parliament. Growing up in the 1960s, Alsammarae received his primary and secondary education in Baghdad, Iraq. He then attended the University of Baghdad, earning his BSc in electrical engineering in 1973.

Upon obtaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree, he completed his obligatory military duty (required of all men over the age of 18 in Iraq) by serving in the Air Force. After completing this requirement, Alsammarae received a scholarship to obtain post-graduate education in the U.S.. He obtained his Masters in Electrical Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL in 1978 and began work on his PhD

By 1980, Alsammarae had resigned from the Ba&#x27;ath Party, and his scholarship to complete his PhD was revoked. In order to complete his studies at IIT, he worked as a teaching assistant and was able to continue with his education, obtaining his PhD in electrical engineering in 1983. After graduation, Alsammarae resided and worked in Chicago, IL as an electrical engineer while also becoming active in the Iraqi opposition. During the 1990s, he became involved with Iraqi charity organizations, sending food, clothing and medicine to those in need in Iraq.

Alsammarae was involved in opposition meetings during the 1990s and leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2003 he was elected as Minister of Electricity and increased electricity production to the highest level seen since the invasion in 2003, despite insurgent attacks, an archaic electrical system, lack of fuel for generators, and lack of qualified personnel.

==Early political career==
Alsammarae was a member of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party during the 1970s while a young college student in Baghdad, Iraq and was required to remain a Ba&#x27;ath Party member in order to obtain a scholarship to continue his studies in the USA. In January 1980, Alsammarae resigned from the party upon news of the execution of two brothers-in-law and one cousin. All three men had been accused of planning a coup attempt against Iraqi president Saddam Hussein; Alsammarae was later implicated in the alleged coup attempt by Iraqi Intelligence officials. Upon resignation from the Ba&#x27;ath Party, Alsammarae became active in the Iraqi opposition as well as numerous Iraqi charity and humanitarian groups. In the 1990s, Alsammarae was elected to serve as national board member in the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and used his role to work on behalf of those suffering under economic sanctions in Iraq. In addition to giving numerous lectures on the detrimental effects of the sanctions on the population of Iraq, Alsammarae organized numerous humanitarian shipments of food, clothing and medicine to Iraq.
In 2002, the US brought numerous Iraqi opposition groups and active opposition members together to discuss the potential for a post-Saddam Iraq. Alsammarae was in attendance at these meetings, and was elected by fellow opposition members to be one of the 65 members of the Coordinating Committee. At these meetings, he advocated the establishment of a secular, democratic Iraq within its currently defined borders. He was strongly opposed to the creation of an Iraqi federation as well as de-Ba&#x27;athifaction, both of which were policies put forth by Ahmed Chalabi. Alsammarae has criticized Chalabi&#x27;s policies and behavior in many instances, including a &quot;Washington Times&quot; article where Alsammarae denounced Chalabi&#x27;s move to a former Hussein palace. Such criticism, though supported by many Iraqi politicians, has rendered Chalabi a relentless political enemy to Alsammarae, and a web page deriding Alsammarae can be found on Chalabi&#x27;s political party website.

==Minister of Electricity==
In August 2003, Alsammarae was appointed to serve as Minister of Electricity under the Coalition Provisional Authority by Paul Bremer and was the first minister of electricity in post-Saddam Iraq. Alsammarae inherited an archaic system providing an output of around 3,000MW (whereas demand is at minimum, 9,000 MW). Additionally, the national grid suffered from daily attacks and theft, lack of manpower and fuel shortages (despite developing new power plants and refurbishing old ones, the Ministry of Oil refused to give the Ministry of Electricity the oil necessary to fuel the power plants). In 2003 and 2004, Alsammarae complained about the lack of fuel on numerous occasions and tried to involve external mediation to solve the loggerhead. Unfortunately, he was unable to encourage the Ministry of Oil to supply fuel to the Ministry of Electricity and this situation persists and remains a problem for the Ministry of Electricity today.

Despite the numerous problems Alsammarae faced in modernizing Iraq&#x27;s electrical system, the electrical output observed during Alsammarae&#x27;s leadership has not since, been matched. In fact, since his departure from the ministry, electricity generation steadily declined to hit all-time lows in October 2006, a full year and a half after he left office. Furthermore, according to current Minister of Electricity, Kareem Waheed, the ministry is still &quot;...working on projects [started] by Dr. Alsammarae&quot;.

In addition to his work in the ministry, Alsammarae spearheaded efforts towards reconciliation with Iraqi insurgent groups, in an attempt to get them to lay down their arms and join the political fold. Alsammarae reached out to &quot;..11 separate Iraqi resistance groups, and at least four of the most important resistance groups --- including the Ba&#x27;athist Jaish Muhammad – gave him a formal letter declaring their willingness to pursue talks with Washington and the interim regime in Baghdad&quot;. Additionally, Alsammarae worked hard to lobby the Iraqi parliament and other Iraqi politicians to reject Chalabi&#x27;s policy of de-ba&#x27;athification. The policy stated that anyone who was a previous Ba&#x27;ath Party Member would be ineligible to serve in the current Iraqi regime. This meant that all public servants, including the police and army, were fired over night. Chalabi was able to garner enough support to push the policy through, and enact it into law in 2003; however as of 2009, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki revoked the law and called for reconciliation efforts, instead.

==Post Ministry==

Alsammarae resigned from the Ministry in May 2005 as Ibrahim al-Ja&#x27;fari, an Iraqi politician with strong ties to Iran was elected as Prime Minister. Alsammarae remained active in political pursuits such as garnering further support for reconciliation as well as encouraging Sunni Muslims&#x27; to be more active in politics. However, in the face of growing Iranian control over Iraq, Alsammarae began to openly criticize the Iranian regime, its presence in Iraq and the Iraqi politicians allied to Iran. This criticism would make him the target of an assassination attempt in January 2006, which resulted in two of his body guards sustaining critical injuries, requiring they be rushed to Amman, Jordan for treatment. The attempt failed, but was followed with charges of corruption leaked to the media by the Iraqi government. Details of the charges are scant, and to date, no Iraqi Government spokesman has revealed any information concerning the charges Alsammarae faced.

According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Alsammarae heard of these charges while he was at his home in Amman, Jordan. He decided to travel to face these charges, but found that he would, instead, be held without being formally charged by the Commission for Public Integrity. The CPI is heavily criticized by Iraqi politicians, with many, such as Masoud Barazani (Governor of Kurdistan), declaring that the CPI is a tool for political retribution and the &quot;...settling of political scores&quot;. Furthermore, the head of the CPI was, himself, accused of corruption by the Iraqi Parliament. Regardless, on 11 October 2006 Alsammarae was convicted of misappropriation of funds regarding a $200,000 generator purchased for the southern province of Maysan. He filed an appeal, and was acquitted of wrongdoing in December 2006. Unfortunately, he was not let out of detainment, and instead was told that he would be taken outside the green zone for finger printing before he would be released. Meanwhile, records show that his family repeatedly contacted the State Department and Senators from their home state of Illinois, asking that they look into his case. On 16 October 2006, Obama&#x27;s Senate office received a faxed plea from Alsammarae&#x27;s son, Ramy Alsammarae. &quot;Alsammarae&#x27;s son claimed in the fax that his father was railroaded for exposing Iraqi government incompetence, and feared his life was in danger.&quot; Fearing his safety outside the green zone and cleared of wrongdoing, Alsammarae escaped the unlawful detention and traveled to Amman, Jordan and back to the United States.

Alsammarae, who has been cleared of all allegations and acquitted by the highest appeals court in Iraq, has continued his work in Iraqi politics. He is currently working with the Iraqi National List, headed by Iyad Allawi. He has concentrated his work on continuing efforts in the area of reconciliation and is actively working to bring Iraqis of various ethnic and religious backgrounds together to form one, nationalistic, secular and democratic front.

==Personal life==
Alsammarae is the CEO of a private engineering consulting firm and lives in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife and three children.

<doc id="440438" wikidata="Q717556" url="?curid=440438" title="Yamashita's gold">
<text>Yamashita&#x27;s gold, also referred to as the Yamashita treasure, is the name given to the alleged war loot stolen in Southeast Asia by Imperial Japanese forces during World War II and supposedly hidden in caves, tunnels, or underground complexes in different cities in the Philippines. It was named after the Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita, dubbed as &quot;The Tiger of Malaya&quot;, who conquered Malaya within 70 days from the British. Though there are accounts that claim the treasure remains hidden in the Philippines and have lured treasure hunters from around the world for over 50 years, its existence has been dismissed by most experts. The rumored treasure was the subject of a complex lawsuit that was filed in a Hawaiian state court in 1988 involving a Filipino treasure hunter, Rogelio Roxas, and the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos.

== Looting of gold ==

Prominent among those who have argued for the existence of Yamashita&#x27;s gold are Sterling Seagrave and his wife Peggy Seagrave, who wrote two books related to the subject: &quot;The Yamato Dynasty: The Secret History of Japan&#x27;s Imperial Family&quot; (2000) and &quot;Gold Warriors: America&#x27;s Secret Recovery of Yamashita&#x27;s Gold&quot; (2003). The Seagraves contend that looting, including more than 6000 tonnes of gold, was organized on a massive scale, by both &quot;yakuza&quot; gangsters such as Yoshio Kodama, and the highest levels of Japanese society, including Emperor Hirohito. The Japanese government intended that loot from Southeast Asia would finance Japan&#x27;s war effort. The Seagraves allege that Hirohito appointed his brother, Prince Yasuhito Chichibu, to head a secret organization named , after a poem that the Emperor Hirohito had written. It is purported that many of those who knew the locations of the loot were killed during the war, or later tried by the Allies for war crimes and executed or incarcerated. Yamashita himself was convicted of war crimes and executed by the United States Army on February 23, 1946, in Los Baños, Laguna, the Philippines.

According to the Seagraves, numerous Golden Lily vaults were found by Edward Lansdale and Severino Garcia Diaz Santa Romana in caves north of Manila in the high valleys and the &quot;, which was named after Major General William Marquat, was established from Santa Romana and Lansdale&#x27;s work. Sterling Seagrave alleged that Santa Romana (Santy) tortured Yamashita&#x27;s driver Major Kojima Kashii to obtain the probable locations of the loot. The Seagraves wrote that Lansdale flew to Tokyo and briefed MacArthur and his Chief of Intelligence Charles Willoughby, later flew to the United States to brief Clark Clifford and returned with Robert Anderson to inspect several caves in Philippines with Douglas MacArthur. More than 170 tunnels and caves were found. Ray Cline believes that both Robert Anderson and Paul Helliwell created 176 &quot;black gold&quot; banking accounts in 42 countries after moving the loot by ship to support future United States operations.

The stolen property reportedly included many different kinds of valuables looted from banks, depositories, other commercial premises, museums, private homes, and religious buildings. It takes its name from General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who assumed command of the Japanese forces in the Philippines in 1944.

According to various accounts, the loot was initially concentrated in Singapore, and later transported to the Philippines. The Japanese hoped to ship the treasure from the Philippines to the Japanese Home Islands after the war ended. As the War in the Pacific progressed, United States Navy submarines and Allied warplanes inflicted increasingly heavy sinkings of Japanese merchant shipping. Some of the ships carrying the war booty back to Japan were sunk in combat.

The Seagraves and a few others have claimed that American military intelligence operatives located much of the loot; they colluded with Hirohito and other senior Japanese figures to conceal its existence, and they used it as &quot;Black Gold&quot; to finance American covert intelligence operations around the world during the Cold War. These rumors have inspired many hopeful treasure hunters, but most experts and Filipino historians say there is no credible evidence behind these claims.

In 1992, Imelda Marcos claimed without evidence that Yamashita&#x27;s gold accounted for the bulk of the wealth of her husband, Ferdinand Marcos.

Many individuals and consortia, both Philippine and foreign, continue to search for treasure sites. A number of accidental deaths, injuries and financial losses incurred by treasure hunters have been reported. The National Museum of the Philippines is responsible for the issuance of treasure hunting permits and licenses.

==Treasure skeptics==
Ricardo Trota Jose, history professor from the University of the Philippines, has questioned the theory that treasure from mainland Southeast Asia was transported to the Philippines: &quot;By 1943 the Japanese were no longer in control of the seas... It doesn&#x27;t make sense to bring in something that valuable here when you know it&#x27;s going to be lost to the Americans anyway. The more rational thing would have been to send it to Taiwan or China.&quot;

Philippines National Historical Institute chairman and historian Ambeth Ocampo commented: &quot;Two of the wealth myths I usually encounter are the Yamashita treasure and gossip that the Cojuangco fortune was founded on a bag of money...&quot; Ocampo also said: &quot;For the past 50 years, many people, both Filipinos and foreigners, have spent their time, money and energy in search of Yamashita&#x27;s elusive treasure.&quot; Professor Ocampo noted &quot;What makes me wonder is that for the past 50 years, despite all the treasure hunters, their maps, oral testimony and sophisticated metal detectors, nobody has found a thing.&quot;

==Rogelio Roxas lawsuit==
In March 1988, a Filipino treasure hunter named Rogelio Roxas filed a lawsuit in the state of Hawaii against the former president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda Marcos for theft and human rights abuses. Roxas claimed that in Baguio in 1961 he met the son of a former member of the Japanese army who mapped for him the location of the legendary Yamashita Treasure. Roxas claimed a second man, who served as Yamashita&#x27;s interpreter during the World War II, told him of visiting an underground chamber there where stores of gold and silver were kept, and who told of a golden buddha kept at a convent located near the underground chambers. Roxas claimed that within the next few years he formed a group to search for the treasure, and obtained a permit for the purpose from a relative of Ferdinand, Judge Pio Marcos. In 1971, Roxas claimed, he and his group uncovered an enclosed chamber on state lands near Baguio where he found bayonets, samurai swords, radios, and skeletal remains dressed in a Japanese military uniform. Also found in the chamber, Roxas claimed, were a golden-colored Buddha and numerous stacked crates which filled an area approximately 6 feet x 6 feet x 35 feet. He claimed he opened just one of the boxes, and found it packed with gold bullion. He said he took from the chamber the golden Buddha, which he estimated to weigh 1,000 kilograms, and one box with twenty-four gold bars, and hid them in his home. He claimed he resealed the chamber for safekeeping until he could arrange the removal of the remaining boxes, which he suspected were also filled with gold bars. Roxas said he sold seven of the gold bars from the opened box, and sought potential buyers for the golden Buddha. Two individuals representing prospective buyers examined and tested the metal in the Buddha, Roxas said, and reported it was made of solid, 20-carat gold. It was soon after this, Roxas claimed, that President Ferdinand Marcos learned of Roxas&#x27; discovery and ordered him arrested, beaten, and the Buddha and remaining gold seized. Roxas alleged that in retaliation to his vocal campaign to reclaim the Buddha and the remainder of the treasure taken from him, Ferdinand continued to have Roxas threatened, beaten, and eventually incarcerated for over a year.

Following his release, Roxas put his claims against Marcos on hold until Ferdinand lost the presidency in 1986. But in 1988, Roxas and the Golden Budha Corporation, which now held the ownership rights to the treasure Roxas claims was stolen from him, filed suit against Ferdinand and wife Imelda in a Hawaiian state court seeking damages for the theft and the surrounding human rights abuses committed against Roxas. Roxas died on the eve of trial, but prior to his death he gave the deposition testimony that would be later used in evidence. In 1996, the Roxas estate and the Golden Budha Corporation received what was then-largest judgment ever awarded in history, $22 billion, which with interest increased to $40.5 billion. In 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury&#x27;s finding that Roxas found the treasure and that Marcos converted it. However, the court reversed the damage award, holding that the $22 billion award of damages for the chamber full of gold was too speculative, as there was no evidence of quantity or quality, and ordered a new hearing on the value of the golden Buddha and 17 bars of gold only. After several more years of legal proceedings, the Golden Budha Corporation obtained a final judgment against Imelda Marcos to the extent of her interest in the Marcos estate in the principal amount of $13,275,848.37 and Roxas’ estate obtained a $6 million judgment on the claim for human right abuse.

This lawsuit ultimately concluded that Roxas found a treasure, and although the Hawaiian state court was not required to determine whether this particular treasure was the legendary Yamashita’s gold, the testimony relied upon by the court in reaching its conclusion pointed in that direction. Roxas was allegedly following a map from the son of a Japanese soldier; Roxas allegedly relied on tips provided from Yamashita’s interpreter; and Roxas allegedly found samurai swords and the skeletons of dead Japanese soldiers in the treasure chamber. All this led the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal to summarize the allegations leading to Roxas’ final judgment as follows: &quot;The Yamashita Treasure was found by Roxas and stolen from Roxas by Marcos&#x27; men.&quot;

==Events surrounding the excavation==
In December 1969, rumors spread that gold bars had been found in the mountains about 40km away from Manila.
In June 2018, local police arrested 17 people, including 4 Japanese, including a 15-year-old boy, and 13 Filipinos, for illegal mining on Capones Island for treasure.

<doc id="440439" wikidata="Q368511" url="?curid=440439" title="Markus Näslund">
<text>Markus Sten Näslund (born 30 July 1973) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey player and former general manager for Modo Hockey of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL, formerly named Elitserien). He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Vancouver Canucks, and New York Rangers, as well as in the Elitserien with Modo Hockey. Nicknamed &quot;Nazzy&quot; by Canucks fans and &quot;Macke&quot; or &quot;Mackan&quot; in his native Sweden, he was known for his offensive skills, particularly his wrist shot and stickhandling.

After playing junior hockey within the Modo organization, Näslund turned professional with the club&#x27;s Elitserien team in 1990–91. Selected in the first round, 16th overall by the Penguins in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, he joined the NHL in 1993–94. After his tenure with Pittsburgh, Näslund was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in 1996, where he spent 12 years, including a team record 8 as captain. With the Canucks, Näslund led the team in scoring for 7 seasons, was thrice first team All-Star, chosen in 2002, 2003 and 2004, a Lester B. Pearson Award recipient in 2003, and runner-up for the Hart, Art Ross, and Rocket Richard Trophies in 2003. He received the Cyclone Taylor Trophy as the Canucks&#x27; most valuable player five times and the Cyrus H. McLean Trophy as the leading point-scorer for seven consecutive seasons—both club records—en route to becoming the franchise leader in goals and points. In 2008, Näslund signed with the Rangers, where he spent one season before announcing his retirement from the NHL after 15 seasons. Midway through the 2009–10 season, he returned to play for Modo before retiring a second time. In December 2010, he became the third Canucks player to have his jersey retired, joining Stan Smyl and Trevor Linden.

Internationally, Näslund has competed with the Swedish national team in two European Junior Championships, two World Junior Championships, four World Championships, two World Cups and one Winter Olympics. He holds the World Junior record for most goals scored in a single tournament, scoring 13 in 1993, while also winning back-to-back silver medals at the competition. In World Championship play, he won a silver medal in 1993 and two bronze medals in 1999 and 2002. On 21 April 2014, Näslund was inducted into the Swedish Hockey Hall Of Fame.

==Early life==
Näslund was born to Sture and Ulla Näslund on 30 July 1973 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The city has produced numerous NHL players, including childhood friend and future Modo Hockey teammate Peter Forsberg, as well as Victor Hedman and future Canucks teammates Henrik and Daniel Sedin.

Growing up idolizing Swedish NHL and Elitserien star Håkan Loob, he played most of his organized hockey at an outdoor rink in his neighbourhood during his youth. At age 14, Näslund competed with the regional all-star team from Ångermanland, helping the squad win a national under-16 championship at TV-pucken in 1988. He received the Sven Tumba Award as the tournament&#x27;s best forward.

Born within 10 days of each other, Näslund and Forsberg became well-acquainted while playing on separate youth teams. They went on to join the Ångermanland team together, before competing on the same side at the junior and senior levels for Modo Hockey and the Swedish national team. They attended high school together and had summer jobs at the age of 18 with the same electrical company that employed both Näslund&#x27;s mother and Forsberg&#x27;s father, Kent.

==Playing career==
===Modo Hockey===
At age 15, Näslund played a season with Örnsköldsviks SK in Sweden&#x27;s third-tier men&#x27;s league. Appearing in 14 games, he scored 7 goals and 13 points. The following season, in 1989–90, Näslund joined the Modo Hockey organization, playing in Sweden&#x27;s highest-level junior league, the J20 SuperElit, where he and Peter Forsberg skated together on one of the most productive lines in the league. The pair helped Modo to win back-to-back junior championships. After a season of junior, in 1990–91 Näslund joined Modo&#x27;s professional team in the Elitserien, Sweden&#x27;s premiere league. The Modo equipment manager designated him with the jersey number 19, which Näslund thereafter opted to wear with the Swedish national teams he played on. He recorded 10 goals and 19 points in his rookie season, a record points total for a 17-year-old in the league, until Robert Nilsson scored 21 in 2002–03.

In the off-season, Näslund was drafted 16th overall in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team&#x27;s general manager, Craig Patrick, hailed Näslund and Forsberg as the draft&#x27;s top two prospects behind first-overall selection Eric Lindros. He compared Näslund to the Los Angeles Kings&#x27; Swedish forward Tomas Sandström, although he did not consider him as aggressive a player, and further claimed that he was a more natural goal-scorer than Penguins forward Jaromír Jágr, who had just completed his rookie year with the club.

Näslund remained in Sweden with Modo for two more years, recording a team-leading 39 points in 1991–92. He matched that points total the following season before helping Modo to the quarterfinals of the Elitserien playoffs.

===Pittsburgh Penguins===
Following the 1992–93 season, his contract with Modo expired on 30 April 1993, and he had not yet come to terms with the Penguins. According to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NHL and NHL Players Association (NHLPA), he was entitled to free agency within the league, beginning on 1 July. However, a conflicting agreement between the league and Swedish ice hockey officials required that he sign an NHL contract on or before 30 June in order to leave Sweden. With the deadline approaching, Näslund filed a federal lawsuit against the NHL claiming that their agreement with Swedish officials could not override his rights as a player under the CBA. The case went to a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, who ruled in favour of Näslund on 29 June. League president and lawyer Gil Stein released an affidavit stating the NHL-Swedish agreement did not apply to Näslund, as he was not under contract with any Swedish team.

Näslund became a Group 4 restricted free agent on 1 July. He did not receive any offers from other teams due to an apparent promise from the Penguins organization to exercise their right to match. After two months of free agency, Näslund and the Penguins agreed to a deal on 9 September 1993, worth approximately US$1.8 million over three years, including a $750,000 signing bonus.

Näslund subsequently joined the Penguins for the 1993–94 season. Due to teammate Bryan Trottier already wearing his Modo jersey number, 19, he chose number 29 instead. He appeared in his first NHL game on 5 October 1993 against the Philadelphia Flyers. Five days later, he registered his first NHL point, an assist, during a game against the Quebec Nordiques. His first NHL goal came the following month on 9 November 1993 in a 3–3 tie against the St. Louis Blues. The goal came in the first period on the powerplay against goaltender Curtis Joseph, assisted by Doug Brown and Marty McSorley. Upon entering the NHL, Näslund struggled and was admittedly frustrated with himself. As a result, he was demoted to the Penguins&#x27; International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks, on several occasions. He finished his rookie campaign with four goals and seven assists in 71 games. Although the Penguins qualified for the 1994 playoffs, Näslund did not participate in post-season play, being made a healthy scratch (non-dressing player), and watched as Washington eliminated Pittsburgh in the first round.

The following season, shortened due to the 1994–95 labour dispute, he continued to split playing time between the NHL and IHL. In 14 games with Pittsburgh, he scored two goals and four points, while recording seven points in seven games with Cleveland. He did not appear in the NHL playoffs for a second straight season, despite the Penguins qualifying. Instead, he was assigned to Cleveland for their playoff season, in which he recorded four points in four games. Frustrated by his ongoing demotions to the IHL, at one point during the season he requested to be traded from Pittsburgh.

Näslund impressed in his third training camp with the Penguins, held prior to the 1995–96 season. He was labelled in the media as &quot;Mr. September&quot;, referring to his ability to show promise before struggling once the season began. Due to the departures of All-Star left-wingers Kevin Stevens and Luc Robitaille from the Penguins, Näslund had an opportunity for a more prominent role with the club in 1995–96. He played on the second offensive unit with winger Jaromír Jágr and centre Ron Francis during training camp before being moved up to the first line with Mario Lemieux. He showed an immediate improvement, starting the season with 36 points in 29 games. He recorded his first NHL career hat-trick on 28 November 1995 in a 7–2 win over the Ottawa Senators. However, his production slowed later in the season; he was scratched on several occasions and was demoted to the third and fourth lines by February.

===Vancouver Canucks===
====1996–2000: Trade to Vancouver and captaincy====
In the final year of his contract with Pittsburgh, he was the subject of trade rumours. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; listed the Edmonton Oilers as the most likely candidate to deal for Näslund. However, on 20 March 1996, he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for forward Alek Stojanov. The deal would be regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history once Näslund displayed his full offensive capabilities later in his career. Stojanov, who had been drafted eight spots ahead of Näslund in the 1991 Draft, went on to play 45 games, scoring two goals and four assists for the Penguins over the next two seasons. He became a career minor-leaguer and retired by age 29, while Näslund would eventually play 884 games with the Canucks in 12 seasons.

Näslund made his debut with the team two days following the trade against the Dallas Stars. As his desired jersey number 19 was already being worn on the team by Tim Hunter, the Canucks gave him number 22. Going pointless in his first nine games with his new club, Näslund recorded a hat-trick in the last game of the regular season, a 5–0 win over the Calgary Flames on 13 April 1996. The victory qualified the Canucks for the 1996 playoffs. He finished the regular season with a combined 22 goals and 55 points over 76 games between Pittsburgh and Vancouver. Näslund competed in his first NHL playoffs as the Canucks faced the Colorado Avalanche in the first round. He scored his first career NHL playoff goal in the final game of the series, opening the scoring against goaltender Patrick Roy on the powerplay. Colorado won 3–2 to eliminate Vancouver in six games. Näslund added two assists over the course of the series for three points total.

In the off-season, he was re-signed by the Canucks on 8 August 1996. Näslund switched his jersey number back to 19 from his time with Modo, as Hunter left the team. In his first full campaign with the Canucks, he recorded 21 goals and 41 points over 78 games. The Canucks failed to qualify for the playoffs that season; they would not return to the post-season until 2001. At the start of the 1997–98 season, Canucks head coach Mike Keenan scratched a healthy Näslund, prompting him to request a trade once again. He finished the year with 14 goals and 34 points over 76 games.

The following campaign, Näslund emerged as an offensive leader with the Canucks. Injuries to forwards Alexander Mogilny and Todd Bertuzzi, as well as the absence of Pavel Bure, resulted in Näslund earning more ice time. He scored his third NHL career hat-trick on 5 December 1998 during a 4–1 win against the Dallas Stars. At mid-season, he was named to his first NHL All-Star Game, held in January 1999. He went on to record a team-leading 36 goals and 66 points, resulting in him being awarded the Cyclone Taylor Trophy as the Canucks&#x27; most valuable player—his first of five during his tenure with Vancouver— as well as his first of two of the team&#x27;s annual Most Exciting Player Awards (he received his second two years later). In the off-season, he was re-signed by the Canucks to a three-year, $7.2 million contract.
During the Canucks&#x27; 2000–01 training camp in Sweden, Näslund was named team captain on 15 September 2000. He replaced Mark Messier, who had returned as a free agent to the New York Rangers, and became the first European-born captain in Canucks&#x27; history. Näslund has cited Messier as his greatest playing influence, having played alongside him the previous three seasons. In his first year as team captain, Näslund continued to improve offensively and was named to his second NHL All-Star Game, held in February 2001. With 10 games remaining in the season, he suffered a broken leg on 16 March 2001 during a contest against the Buffalo Sabres. Chasing a loose puck in the third period, he was hit by Sabres defencemen Jay McKee and Rhett Warrener simultaneously, falling awkwardly on his right leg. Näslund was sidelined for the remainder of the season, as he required surgery to repair broken tibia and fibula bones. His 41 goals at the time of the injury were tied for third in the league, while his 75 points ranked in 11th place. As a result, he received his first of three career Viking Awards, given to the best Swedish player in the NHL. Without Näslund in the lineup, the Canucks finished the season with the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference, but were swept in the first round by the Colorado Avalanche in four games.

The Canucks&#x27; return to the playoffs marked a turning point in the team&#x27;s success. After undergoing a rebuilding period in the late-90s under leading point-scorers Messier, Bure and Mogilny, Näslund formed a new core that included Bertuzzi, Brendan Morrison, Ed Jovanovski and Mattias Öhlund. He recalls &quot;grow[ing] up together in the early 2000s&quot; with this group of players as his &quot;fondest memory&quot; in the NHL.

====2001–2005 West Coast Express====
Set to enter the final year of his contract, Näslund re-signed with the Canucks to a three-year extension on 28 June 2001. He spent the off-season rehabilitating his leg, which was held together with a titanium rod and screws following surgery, at his private gym in his hometown of Örnsköldsvik. He returned from his injury in 2001–02 and improved to 40 goals and 90 points, which ranked second in the league behind Jarome Iginla. The 2001–02 campaign marked the beginning of what was widely considered the most effective line combination in the league for several seasons. Näslund and Bertuzzi had already formed a duo as wingers on the Canucks&#x27; top line for more than two seasons when head coach Marc Crawford replaced centre Andrew Cassels with Brendan Morrison during a game on 9 January 2002. The trio were dubbed the &quot;West Coast Express&quot;, named after Vancouver&#x27;s commuter rail service of the same name.

The formation of Näslund&#x27;s new line coincided with an eight-goal, 21-point effort over 14 games in January 2002, earning him NHL Player of the Month honours. He was later chosen to represent the World Team at the 2002 NHL All-Star Game in Los Angeles and scored the game-winning goal in an 8–5 victory over the North American team. The Canucks finished the season with the eighth seed in the Western Conference for the second straight year, resulting in a first-round playoff match-up with the Detroit Red Wings. It was Näslund&#x27;s first appearance in the post-season since his initial year with the Canucks in 1996. He was limited to a goal and an assist as Vancouver was eliminated by a Detroit side captained by the legendary Steve Yzerman and backstopped by perennial All-Star and future Hall of Famer Dominic Hasek. The Canucks fell in six games, despite winning the opening two games of the series. In the off-season, Näslund received NHL first team All-Star honours as the league&#x27;s top left-winger. He also finished fifth in Hart Memorial Trophy balloting.

In 2002–03, with the West Coast Express line intact for a full season, Näslund finished with a career-high of 48 goals and 104 points, finishing second in the league in both categories. Furthermore, he led the league with 54 powerplay points and 12 game-winning goals. Näslund&#x27;s linemates also produced career seasons as Bertuzzi recorded 97 points, which ranked fifth in league scoring, while Morrison tallied 71. Together, the trio accounted for 45% of the Canucks&#x27; 264 goals.

Early in the season, Näslund scored his eighth career NHL hat-trick, scoring three goals in a seven-minute span during the second period of a 5–2 win over the San Jose Sharks on 21 October 2002. On 14 December, he scored a career-high four goals in a 6–3 win over the Edmonton Oilers, tying a Canucks record for most goals in a single game. Named to his third consecutive All-Star Game, held in February 2003, Näslund scored a goal in the first shootout in All-Star Game history to help the Western Conference defeat the Eastern Conference 6–5. He was joined on the All-Star squad by three other Canucks – Bertuzzi, Ed Jovanovski and head coach Marc Crawford. Crawford paired Näslund on a line with Peter Forsberg, marking the first time in nearly 10 years the two had played together. Later that month, Näslund registered another career-high game with a six-point night (one goal, five assists) in an 8–0 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers on 14 February 2003. The win extended the Canucks&#x27; franchise record unbeaten streak to 14 games. On 27 March, he recorded an assist in a 5–1 win against the Phoenix Coyotes for his 100th point of the season, becoming the third Canuck to reach the plateau after Pavel Bure and Alexander Mogilny.
On the last day of the 2002–03 regular season, the Canucks lost the Northwest Division title to the Colorado Avalanche through a defeat against the Los Angeles Kings. Näslund had also begun the night as the league&#x27;s leading point – and goal-scorer, but was surpassed by Avalanche forwards Peter Forsberg and Milan Hejduk, respectively. After the game, Näslund apologized to the home fans at General Motors Place, saying the team &quot;choked.&quot; Qualifying for the 2003 playoffs, Vancouver won its first-round matchup against the St. Louis Blues in seven games after trailing the series three games to one. Näslund scored a goal in the deciding game to help the Canucks advance. Against the Minnesota Wild in the next round, the Canucks were eliminated by relinquishing a three-to-one series lead of their own. Näslund finished the playoffs with a career-high 14 points in 14 games.

In the off-season, Näslund received the Lester B. Pearson Award (since renamed the Ted Lindsay Award), given to the league&#x27;s best player as voted by the NHLPA. By beating out fellow award nominees Forsberg and Boston Bruins centre Joe Thornton, he became the first Swedish-born recipient of the award, as well as the first Canucks player. He was presented the trophy during a ceremony at the Hockey Hall of Fame. Näslund was also a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the league&#x27;s most valuable player as voted by the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association. He finished as first runner-up to Forsberg, receiving five first-place ballots out of 62 compared to Forsberg&#x27;s 38. Second runner-up Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils had 14 first-place ballots, but less voting points overall than Näslund. Despite losing the Hart, he was chosen by &quot;The Hockey News&quot; as the league&#x27;s most valuable player that year. Näslund also received both the Viking Award and First Team All-Star honours for the second time.

The following season, Näslund led the Canucks in scoring for the sixth-straight year. His 84 points ranked fourth in the league, while his 35 goals was seventh. His even-strength points topped the league at 58. It marked, however, the beginning of a consistent decline in offensive production for the remainder of his NHL career. He was briefly sidelined in early December 2003 due to a groin injury, but returned to score his second career four-goal game, scoring all the Canucks&#x27; goals in a 4–3 overtime win against the Pittsburgh Penguins, on 9 December 2003. At mid-season, he was selected as team captain for the Western Conference at the 2004 NHL All-Star Game in Minnesota.

On 16 February 2004, during a game against the Colorado Avalanche, Näslund received a body-check to the head from opposing forward Steve Moore. Outstretched to retrieve a loose puck, he was hit by Moore with his elbow and shoulder. The league&#x27;s leading scorer at the time, he sustained a minor concussion, requiring 13 stitches on his forehead and nose, and was sidelined for three games. He also suffered a hyper-extended elbow when he fell to the ice, which he played with through the remainder of the regular season and playoffs. Moore&#x27;s hit went unpenalized and several Canucks players vowed to exact revenge when the Canucks and Avalanche were set to play each other again on 8 March. Late in the third period of that subsequent game, Todd Bertuzzi skated behind Moore around the ice, punched him in the head and pushed him to the ice. Moore suffered career-ending injuries and Bertuzzi was suspended indefinitely by the league. A close friend of Bertuzzi&#x27;s, Näslund was deeply affected by the incident, as subsequent lawsuits and public scrutiny negatively impacted Bertuzzi&#x27;s career. Several years later, Näslund stated, &quot;It still bothers me what Todd has had to go through...There&#x27;s no question he was standing up for me...it all went too far.&quot;

Despite the absence of Bertuzzi for the remainder of the season, Näslund led the Canucks to the Northwest Division title they had lost the previous season. Bertuzzi was replaced on the top line by Matt Cooke. The Canucks&#x27; division title placed them third in the Western Conference standings, matching them against the sixth-placed Calgary Flames in the opening round of the 2004 playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the series between the two teams, the Canucks faced a one-goal deficit in the final minute of regulation time. With the Canucks having pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker, Näslund stickhandled the length of the ice past two defenders, before shooting the puck on goal. Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff saved the shot before Cooke scored on the rebound with six seconds left in the game. Despite the effort, Calgary subsequently eliminated Vancouver a minute-and-a-half into the subsequent overtime period on a powerplay goal. Näslund finished the playoffs with nine points in seven games.

At the end of the campaign, he received his second consecutive and third career Viking Award and First Team All-Star mention. In the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04, Näslund scored the most goals (123) and points (278) of any NHL player.

During the NHL labour conflict, he returned to play for Modo Hockey of the Elitserien in 2004–05. Näslund announced his return in mid-January in order to meet the 31 January player-transfer deadline for European clubs, joining Canucks teammates Daniel and Henrik Sedin, as well as former Modo teammate Peter Forsberg on the squad. He was originally expected to sign with Modo before the season started in September, but he returned to Vancouver after spending the summer in Sweden. Vancouver radio-station Team 1040 cited high tax premiums explaining the decision, while Näslund later reasoned that he preferred to be readily available for the NHL, just in case the league and NHLPA could come to an agreement and the season was salvaged.

He played his first game for Modo in nearly 12 years on 20 January 2005, receiving a standing ovation from the home crowd. Näslund went on to appear in 13 games, scoring 17 points. Modo finished in sixth place during the regular season before being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Färjestad BK.

====Post-lockout====
As NHL play was set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Näslund became an unrestricted free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6 million per season. Vancouver newspaper &quot;The Province&quot; reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had a better chance of winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.

For a franchise-record seventh consecutive season, he led the Canucks in scoring, with 32 goals and 79 points. Despite new NHL rules set in place after the lockout that sought to allow skilled players such as Näslund and his linemates to thrive, all three members of the Canucks&#x27; top line saw decreased offensive production in 2005–06. Furthermore, the Canucks failed to make the playoffs for the first time in four seasons, finishing at ninth place in the Western Conference, despite early-season projections to be Stanley Cup contenders. Consequently, significant changes to the Canucks&#x27; personnel were made in the off-season. Of particular significance to Näslund, longtime linemate Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, while Alain Vigneault replaced Marc Crawford with a more defensive-minded coaching approach. Crawford later recalled the 2005–06 season as a turning point in Näslund&#x27;s role as the offensive leader on the team, noting that Henrik and Daniel Sedin had surpassed him and Bertuzzi in that respect as the campaign progressed.

Facing significant changes in the 2006–07 season, Näslund&#x27;s points total continued to decrease. He began the season by scoring his 300th goal as a Canuck during the team&#x27;s home-opener against the San Jose Sharks on 14 October 2006. The goal tied Canucks teammate Trevor Linden for the franchise lead in all-time goals. He soon surpassed Linden with his 301st goal against the Edmonton Oilers on 17 October. Near the midway point of the season, however, Näslund went through a 17-game stretch without a goal. He completed the season with 60 points, his lowest output since 1997–98. Teammate Daniel Sedin had 84 points, marking the first time in eight seasons that Näslund did not lead the team in scoring. In the 2007 post-season, Näslund contributed five points before the team was eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in the Conference Semifinals.

In 2007–08, Näslund set several more career marks. On 21 November 2007, Näslund tied the Canucks&#x27; franchise record of 10 hat-tricks with a three-goal game against the Minnesota Wild, a 4–2 win for Vancouver. It was his first hat-trick since December 2003 and 11th in his career overall. Several games later, on 5 December, Näslund became the Canucks&#x27; franchise leading point-scorer, assisting on defenceman Mattias Öhlund&#x27;s goal and passing Linden with 725 points. The following month, on 17 January 2008, Näslund played his 1,000th career game against the Detroit Red Wings, scoring a goal in a 3–2 shootout loss. Playing parts of the season on a line with Daniel and Henrik Sedin, he recorded 25 goals and 55 points.

As Näslund&#x27;s free agency approached on 1 July 2008, Näslund made it clear that the style of play and the player personnel of a team would be important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault&#x27;s defensive coaching style.
Furthermore, since Bertuzzi&#x27;s departure in the summer of 2006, Vigneault placed Näslund on inconsistent line combinations, often with career minor-leaguers. While he did not rule out the possibility of returning to Vancouver, he sold his Vancouver home and described his return as questionable.

===New York Rangers===

Näslund signed a two-year, $8 million contract, including a $1 million signing bonus, with the New York Rangers on 3 July 2008. Upon signing, he revealed New York was his preferred destination heading into free agency. He left Vancouver as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in goals and points with 346 and 756, respectively. His departure also ended his eight-year tenure as team captain, matching Stan Smyl&#x27;s captaincy as the longest in franchise history. General manager Mike Gillis, who formerly acted as Näslund&#x27;s agent, released a statement on behalf of the Canucks organization, commending him as &quot;one of the greatest athletes to ever represent the Canucks both on and off of the ice&quot;.

Naslund chose to wear #91 with the Rangers, as his #19 was already being worn by Scott Gomez.

As the Rangers held their training camp for the 2008–09 season overseas in Europe, they competed in a one-game challenge against Russian squad Metallurg Magnitogorsk on 1 October 2008 in Bern, Switzerland. The Rangers won the game 4–3, capturing the inaugural Victoria Cup. On 3 October, Näslund was named an alternate captain for the Rangers. The next day, he scored his first goal as a Ranger during the season-opener in Prague, Czech Republic, a 2–1 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. In his only season with the Rangers, Näslund led the team in scoring with 24 goals and was fourth in points with 46. He added three points in the playoffs, as the Rangers were eliminated in the first round by the Washington Capitals.

Following the Rangers&#x27; defeat, he announced his retirement from the NHL on 4 May 2009, at the age of 35. Näslund had informed Rangers general manager Glen Sather, head coach John Tortorella, and his teammates of his intention to retire prior to the team&#x27;s playoff elimination. By announcing his retirement early in the off-season, Näslund forfeited a $2 million buyout from the Rangers, which would have counted against the team&#x27;s salary cap for the following season had he waited until he was formally bought out. Näslund retired from the NHL second among all-time Swedish players with 395 goals (behind Mats Sundin&#x27;s 564; he retired the same year). His 869 points ranked fifth, while his 1,117 games played ranked fourth.

===Return to Modo and retirement===
Näslund returned to Sweden with his family in the summer of 2009. During this time, Peter Forsberg was attempting a return to the NHL for the 2009–10 season, playing with Modo and the Swedish national team for conditioning purposes. Among the NHL teams interested were the Vancouver Canucks. Näslund had previously tried recruiting Forsberg to play for the Canucks prior to the 2007–08 season, when Forsberg was an unrestricted free agent, without any luck. Weighing in on Forsberg&#x27;s possible NHL return, Näslund speculated that Forsberg would remain in Sweden to continue playing for Modo. Several days later, Canucks general manager Mike Gillis confirmed Näslund&#x27;s speculation, asserting that Forsberg intended on finishing the season with Modo.

The following day, on 17 November 2009, Näslund announced he was coming out of retirement to join Forsberg with Modo for the remainder of the 2009–10 Elitserien season. He explained that while he did not miss playing, both he and Forsberg desired to help their former club out of financial troubles and a last-place standing in the league, facing potential relegation. The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. As a board member of the club, Näslund said he and Forsberg would play without salary.

Näslund played in his first game back with Modo on 28 November, 11 days after the announcement, registering an assist on the first goal of the game by Forsberg. Modo won the game 4–1 over Rögle BK. The following match, on 1 December, he registered two assists, setting up the game-tying goal with two seconds remaining in regulation by team captain Per Svartvadet and the overtime-winner by Forsberg. He scored his first goal since his return on 8 December in a 4–1 win over HV71. On 27 February, he notched a hat-trick against Färjestad BK in a 10–3 win. Playing in 29 of Modo&#x27;s 55 games, Näslund scored at a point-per-game pace with 10 goals and 19 assists. Ranked last in the league prior to Näslund&#x27;s return, Modo went on to earn 58 points in the remaining 36 games of the season, but finished one point out of a playoff spot. Näslund confirmed his second retirement following the campaign.

At the start of the 2010–11 NHL season, the NHL and NHLPA honoured Näslund with a tribute and ceremonial puck drop prior to a game held in Stockholm, Sweden, between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets. Several months later, the Canucks retired his number 19 jersey prior to a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 11 December 2010. Attending the on-ice ceremony were his wife, three children, parents and sister, as well as former Canucks teammates, coaches and executives. The night included a video tribute highlighting his hockey career, speeches from team personalities and gift presentations from the organization. In honour of Näslund and his wife&#x27;s past philanthropy in the Vancouver community, the team also announced the establishment of a sports equipment centre for underprivileged children. Prior to the jersey raising, Näslund thanked those involved in his career. Reflecting on his career, he commented, &quot;Young hockey players from northern Sweden never dream of a night like this...To go from sitting up in the press box as a healthy scratch to be standing here in front of you is quite amazing.&quot; By having his jersey retired, he became the third player in team history to receive the honour, after Stan Smyl and Trevor Linden.

==International play==
Näslund made his first international appearance for Sweden at the 1989 Four Nations Tournament in the Soviet Union. The following year, he competed in the 1990 European Junior Championships, an under-18 tournament. He went pointless in six games, but helped Sweden to a gold medal finish. He improved the following year with a tournament-leading 14 goals. His 16 points ranked second overall to teammate Peter Forsberg. Sweden failed to defend their gold medal.

Näslund continued to play in junior tournaments over the next two years, competing in the 1992 and 1993 World Junior Championships, where Sweden won back-to-back silver medals. During his first tournament appearance in Germany, he recorded 10 points, ranking third among all players, including a tournament-leading eight goals (tied with four others). Sweden finished second in the tournament&#x27;s round-robin format to the Commonwealth of Independent States with a record of five wins, one loss and one tie.

The following year, Sweden hosted the World Junior tournament in Gävle. Näslund set a competition record for most goals scored in a single year with 13, while playing on a line with Forsberg and Niklas Sundström. His 24 points were second in the tournament behind Forsberg&#x27;s 31. Although Sweden and Canada finished with identical records of six wins and one loss, Canada was awarded the gold medal by virtue of their 3–2 win against Sweden during round-robin play. Näslund was named along with Forsberg to the Tournament All-Star team.

Näslund made his senior international debut later that year at the 1993 World Championships in Munich and Dortmund, Germany, where he earned another silver medal with Sweden. He contributed a goal and an assist over eight games. Three years later, he was added to Sweden&#x27;s roster for the 1996 World Championships in Vienna, Austria, after the Canucks were eliminated in the NHL playoffs. He was pointless while competing in one game, as Sweden failed to medal. Several months later, Näslund competed in the inaugural 1996 World Cup, but was again limited to one game. Sweden reached the semifinal, where they were eliminated by Canada. Competing in his third World Championships in 1999, Näslund helped Sweden to a bronze medal with a 10-point effort in 10 games.

In 2002, Näslund made his first and only appearance in the Winter Olympics at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. He scored his first and only two Olympic goals during a 7–1 win against Germany. After going undefeated in the round-robin and heralded as medal favourites, Sweden was defeated by Belarus 4–3 in the quarterfinal. The loss was widely considered one of the most surprising results in Olympic history, while Näslund described the defeat in a post-game interview as &quot;devastating...for us and our country.&quot; He finished the tournament with two goals and an assist over four games, ranking fourth on the team in scoring.

Several months later, he participated in his final World Championships in 2002, a tournament Sweden hosted in the cities of Gothenburg, Karlstad and Jönköping. He was added to the roster prior to the quarterfinal, following the Canucks&#x27; first-round elimination in the NHL playoffs. Sweden was defeated by Slovakia 3–2 in the semifinal. They went on to win their consolation match against Finland 5–3 to capture the bronze medal. It was Näslund&#x27;s second bronze medal in as many tournament appearances; he scored three points in three games.

Prior to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Näslund participated in his final international competition at the 2004 World Cup, where he failed to score a goal in four games played. Although he was named to Team Sweden for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Näslund chose not to play due to a groin injury. Sweden went on to win the gold medal, defeating Finland in the final.

==Playing style==

Näslund was known as a highly skilled offensive player with good skating and puck-handling abilities. The most prominent aspect of his game was his wrist shot, which was known to be one of the most accurate in the league and accounted for a large portion of his goals. He also earned many of his points on the powerplay. Regarding his skill level and creativity, his first Canucks head coach, Marc Crawford, heralded him as one of &quot;a handful of players in this game who can take a play where there&#x27;s nothing...and turn it into a scoring chance&quot;.

Näslund&#x27;s prime coincided with the contributing performances of his linemates Bertuzzi and Morrison. His finesse and goal-scoring abilities were complemented by Morrison&#x27;s playmaking and Bertuzzi&#x27;s strength and aggression as a power forward. They were known for playing a fast and entertaining style. As a result, head coach Marc Crawford implemented a highly offensive coaching strategy.

As captain of the Canucks for eight years, Näslund was a self-professed &quot;leader by example&quot; with his work ethic and play on the ice. He was often criticized by the media and fans in his final few seasons with the Canucks for not being sufficiently vocal or emotional as the team&#x27;s captain. Former teammates in Vancouver have described him as a quiet leader that spoke when needed nonetheless. They have also commended him for his integrity, professionalism and the caring manner in which he treated everyone in the organization. In particular, fellow Swedes Daniel and Henrik Sedin have singled him out as a player that mentored them early in their NHL career. New York Rangers general manager Glen Sather reiterated the guiding influence Näslund had on young players coming into the league.

These criticisms began especially in light of his decreasing offensive production following the 2004–05 NHL lockout. The decline was often attributed in the media to him becoming more defensively responsible under new Canucks coach Alain Vigneault. Bertuzzi&#x27;s absence following the 2005–06 season was also seen as a negative factor for Näslund individually. It was further proposed that the physical effects of his concussion, as a result of Steve Moore&#x27;s hit against him in 2004, as well as the emotional toll of Bertuzzi&#x27;s subsequent retaliation against Moore strained his playing efficiency.

==Management career==
Midway through the 2010–11 Elitserien season on 17 December 2010, Näslund was named the general manager of the Modo organization, overseeing all the organization&#x27;s sports clubs. In his first season with the organization, the hockey club finished last in the Elitserien, six points out of a playoff spot. Facing relegation to the second-tier HockeyAllsvenskan, Modo finished second in the 2011 Kvalserien, retaining their Elitserien status for the 2011–12 season.

In the off-season, Näslund was joined by Peter Forsberg on Modo&#x27;s management team. Forsberg was announced as Modo&#x27;s assistant manager in April 2011.

==Off the ice==
===Personal===
Näslund and his wife Lotta have three children: Rebecca, Isabella, and Alex. During his NHL career, they spent their summers in Sweden. Like Swedes Nicklas Lidström and his childhood idol, Håkan Loob, Näslund had expressed a desire to raise his children in his homeland Sweden. He made headlines when he first publicly contemplated an early retirement from the NHL to serve those purposes during the 2002–03 season. However, he also considered Vancouver his home and cherished his time spent in the city as a member of the Canucks.

Upon being signed by the Rangers, Näslund and his family moved to Tarrytown, New York. Following his retirement from the NHL in 2009, they returned to Sweden, where Näslund began coaching his son&#x27;s minor-league hockey team before he became the general manager of Modo. He participated in the construction of a new house in Örnsköldsvik that his family moved into.

Markus has also ventured into business as a real estate developer.

===Philanthropy===
In 2002, Näslund and Forsberg founded Icebreakers, an organization that raises money for sick and disabled children in their home region of Västernorrland. A team of Swedish all-stars are annually assembled to host exhibition charity games against varying challengers.

In Vancouver, Näslund ran a program called &quot;Nazzy&#x27;s Suite 19&quot; that gave underprivileged children the opportunity to watch Canucks games from a private suite in GM Place. Game attendees were chosen through local children&#x27;s charities. The program was later taken over by Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo and renamed &quot;Lui&#x27;s Crease Club&quot; after Näslund&#x27;s departure from Vancouver. Along with other Canucks players, Näslund made regular visits to Canuck Place, a children&#x27;s hospice that provides specialized care for children with life-threatening illnesses; BC Children&#x27;s Hospital; and was a contributor to the Canucks For Kids Fund. He also appeared in a public service announcement with BC Children&#x27;s Hospital, educating provincial viewers on mental health issues.

Following his NHL retirement, he joined the anniversary tour of the NHLPA&#x27;s Goals and Dreams program, a charity that donates hockey equipment to underprivileged children. Näslund began the tour in Örnsköldsvik before joining former Canucks teammates Jyrki Lumme and Pavel Bure for stops in Helsinki and Moscow, respectively.

===Endorsements===
At the peak of his career, Näslund signed multiple endorsement deals, most notably with Nike Bauer and Electronic Arts (EA). In 2004, EA Sports selected Näslund to appear on the cover of &quot;NHL 2005&quot;, EA&#x27;s yearly hockey video game. He is also on the European cover of &quot;NHL 2000&quot;.

<text>Abdul Latif Rashid (; born 10 August 1944), also known as Letif Rashid (), is an Iraqi politician serving as the ninth president of Iraq. He was previously the Minister of Water Resources under the government of Nouri al-Maliki. Before that, he served in the same position under both the Iraqi Transitional Government and the Iraqi Interim Government. Rashid was formerly a spokesperson for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in the United Kingdom. Rashid is the fourth non-Arab president of Iraq, succeeding Barham Salih.

As Minister for Water Resources from September 2003 until December 2010, Rashid was responsible for a range of issues, including irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, hydropower, flood control, and environmental requirements, including marsh restoration.

== Early life and education ==
Rashid was born in 1944 in Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan, Kingdom of Iraq, to an upper-class Kurdish family. Rashid took British A-Levels in North Wales. He has a B.Sc. (1968) in Civil Engineering from Liverpool University and an M.Sc. (1973) and Ph.D. (1978) in Engineering from Manchester University. After having graduated from Liverpool University he became a lecturer at the University of Sulaymaniah in 1969. Upon returning to Iraq, he became an active member of the PUK under the leadership of Jalal Talabani, his brother-in-law.

== Professional career ==

Rashid has been involved with a number of programs and organizations related to engineering and agriculture developments. He previously worked as a senior Project Manager for the UN&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. He has been a member of the Executive Council of the Iraqi National Congress (INC) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan&#x27;s Representative in the UK since 1986 and a spokesman for the Kurdistan Front.

Rashid is a chartered engineer and a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineering and the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID). He has been a freelance consultant for irrigation and drainage projects and worked with the Water Engineering Administration.
In 1992, Rashid was elected vice president and Executive Member of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), and in 1998, he was elected to the INC&#x27;s six-member leadership.

== Political career ==
Apart from having technical qualifications and engagements, Rashid has actively participated in Kurdish and Iraqi politics. In 1986, he became the spokesman for the PUK in the United Kingdom. He has attended many conferences and official meetings on behalf of Kurdish political parties and Iraqi opposition groups during Saddam&#x27;s regime. Rashid has also represented Kurdish politics and Iraqi opposition groups to Saddam in official meetings with various international institutions and governments. In 2003, he became the minister of water resources, a post he kept until 2010. He served as a presidential adviser from 2010.

== President of Iraq ==
Under the power-sharing agreement among the major ethnic and religious groupings in the country, a Sunni Kurd is elected as president, a Shia Arab as prime minister, and a Sunni Arab as speaker of parliament. On 13 October 2022, Rashid was elected as the 9th President of Iraq after the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime. Rashid replaced Barham Salih as head of state after the two-round vote in parliament, winning &quot;more than 162 votes&quot; against 99 for Salih. Rashid &quot;immediately&quot; appointed politician Mohammed Shia&#x27; Al Sudani as prime minister-designate. This appointment ended the yearlong deadlock.

In January 2025, President Rashid filed a lawsuit against Prime Minister Mohammed Shia&#x27; Al Sudani and Finance Minister Taif Sami requesting a court order mandating the uninterrupted and timely payment of salaries for Kurdistan Region’s civil servants. 

=== Foreign policy === 

Rashid opposes the normalization of diplomatic relations as long as Turkey violates Iraq&#x27;s sovereignty. On 8 April 2023, Rashid condemned Turkey&#x27;s alleged bombardment of an area near Sulaimaniyah airport inside Iraq&#x27;s autonomous Kurdish region. A source from the Turkish Defense Ministry stated to Agence France Press that Turkey&#x27;s armed forces &quot;undertook no such activity.&quot;

Speaking on 27 February 2023, Rashid said that the 2003 invasion of Saddam-ruled Iraq by the United States and its allies was &quot;necessary&quot; because of the regime&#x27;s &quot;brutality.&quot; He claimed that &quot;after twenty years,&quot; now &quot;peace and security [are] all over the country.&quot; However, long-awaited public projects, especially in the transport sector, have not materialized, a shortcoming he attributed to lingering corruption. The Iraqi president expressed the belief that &quot;improving relations with neighbors, including Iran, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Jordan, is a source of strength for Iraq.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He is married to Shanaz Ibrahim Ahmed and they are the parents to three children.

<text>Earl of Jersey is a title in the Peerage of England. It is held by a branch of the Villiers family, which since 1819 has been the Child Villiers family.

==History==
The earldom was created in 1697 for the statesman Edward Villiers, 1st Viscount Villiers, Ambassador to France from 1698 to 1699 and Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1699 to 1700. He had already been created Baron Villiers, of Hoo in the County of Kent, and Viscount Villiers, of Dartford in the County of Kent, in 1691, also in the Peerage of England.

A member of the prominent Villiers family, he was the grandson of Sir Edward Villiers, brother of Sir William Villiers, 1st Baronet, of Brooksby, and half-brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey and John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Kent in the House of Commons from 1705 to 1708. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. In 1766, he succeeded his second cousin John Villiers, 1st Earl Grandison, as sixth Viscount Grandison through a special remainder in the letters patent.

His son, the fourth Earl, was a politician and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, as Master of the Buckhounds and as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He was a Tory politician and served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Master of the Horse. Lord Jersey married Sarah Sophia (died 1867), daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, and his wife Sarah Anne (died 1793), daughter of Robert Child. Through this marriage, the private bank Child &amp; Co. came into the Villiers family.

On account of the considerable wealth brought to the family through this marriage, in 1819, Lord Jersey assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Child, and since then the branch of the family has been known as Child-Villiers. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the sixth Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Rochester, Minehead, Honiton and Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and Cirencester. He succeeded in the earldom on 3 October 1859 and died on 24 October 1859, having held the title for only twenty-one days. Lord Jersey married Julia, daughter of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, in 1841.

He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He served in the second Conservative administration of Lord Salisbury as Paymaster General from 1889 to 1890 and was Governor of New South Wales from 1890 to 1893. On his death in 1915, the titles passed to his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He served briefly under David Lloyd George as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from January to August 1919. In 1923, he sold Child &amp; Co to Glyn, Mills &amp; Co. His son, the ninth Earl, was a Major in the Royal Artillery (TA).

 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded in 1998. He is the eldest son of George Henry Villiers, Viscount Villiers (1948–1998), eldest son of the ninth Earl. Lord Jersey is an actor, writer and producer, known professionally as William Villiers.

The heirs apparent to the earldom alternate the use of the two viscomital titles as their courtesy title. The tenth Earl was briefly styled &quot;Viscount Grandison&quot; between the deaths of his father, Viscount Villiers, and his grandfather, the ninth Earl, and so the next heir is therefore styled &quot;Viscount Villiers&quot;.

The present family seat is Radier Manor, on the island of Jersey. Previous family seats were Middleton Park in Oxfordshire and Osterley Park in Middlesex.

The Earls of Jersey are also in remainder of the title of Duke of Marlborough, for being descendants of one of &quot;the daughters of his daughters, by primogeniture, and their heirs male&quot; of the 1st Duke.

The parish church of All Saints at Middleton Stoney, near Middleton Park, is the burial place of most of the Earls of Jersey.

==Earl of Clarendon==
Another member of the family to gain distinction was the Hon. Thomas Villiers, second son of the second Earl. He was created Earl of Clarendon in 1776 (see this title for more information on this branch of the family).

==Jacobite earldoms of Jersey==
In April 1716, two Jacobite earldoms of Jersey were created by the Old Pretender, the first for Barbara, née Chiffinch, the widow of the first Earl of the 1697 creation, and the other for their eldest son (who succeeded as second Earl of the 1697 creation) with the subsidiary titles Viscount Dartford and Baron Hoo. The first became extinct on the Countess&#x27;s death in 1735.

<text>Alex Joseph Jean Tanguay (born November 21, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger who played for the Colorado Avalanche, Calgary Flames, Montreal Canadiens, Tampa Bay Lightning and Arizona Coyotes in the National Hockey League (NHL) and briefly for HC Lugano in the Swiss National League A in 2004. An offensive player, he is best known for his passing and ability. Tanguay currently serves as an assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings.

An alumnus of the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), Tanguay has his jersey retired. During his junior career, he was also a member of Canada&#x27;s under-20 team at the 1998 World Junior Championships. Selected in the first round, 12th overall, by the Colorado Avalanche at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, he began his NHL career with Colorado in 1999. Tanguay won the Stanley Cup with Colorado in 2001, scoring two goals in Game 7 against the New Jersey Devils.

Individually, he was nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy following his rookie season and was chosen to the 2004 All-Star Game during his six-year tenure with Colorado. In July 2006, he was traded to the Flames and spent two years with the club before single-season stints with the Montreal Canadiens and Tampa Bay Lightning.

In July 2010, he returned to Calgary, signing as an unrestricted free agent. After three seasons with Calgary, he returned to Colorado for the 2013–14 season. In February 2016, Tanguay was traded from the Avalanche to the Arizona Coyotes, retiring at the season&#x27;s conclusion.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
As a youth, Tanguay played in the 1992 and 1993 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Beauce, Quebec. Following a season of midget AAA hockey with the Cap-de-Madeleine Estacades, Tanguay joined the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the 1996–97 season. He played 70 games, scored 27 goals and 68 points and was named to the QMJHL All-Rookie Team. The following season, he improved to 47 goals and 85 points in 51 league games. He was a member of the eighth place Canadian junior team at the 1998 World Junior Hockey Championship, finishing second in team-scoring with three points in seven games.

In a draft in which they had four first-round selections, the Colorado Avalanche made Tanguay their first pick, 12th overall, at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He was invited to Colorado&#x27;s training camp that fall, and impressed the team such that he made the team as an 18-year-old. Tanguay and the Avalanche, however, were unable to come to terms on a contract and he was instead returned to Halifax for the 1998–99 season.

A few games into his third season with the Mooseheads, he tied a franchise record with five points in one game, an 11–3 victory over the Baie-Comeau Drakkar on October 9, 1998, then tied another record with four goals in a 6–1 defeat of the Drummondville Voltigeurs six nights later. However, he suffered a concussion early in the season which forced him out of the line-up for 28 games. Though he was limited to 31 contests in 1998–99, he scored 27 goals and 61 points. Tanguay finished his junior career as the Mooseheads&#x27; all-time leader in goals (101), assists (113) and points (214). In honour of his accomplishments, the team retired his #18 jersey in 2005.

Having replaced his agent following his earlier inability to sign with Colorado, Tanguay agreed to a contract with the Avalanche during the season and was assigned to Colorado&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate after his junior season ended. He scored one goal and two assists in five regular season games and added two assists in five playoff games.

===Colorado Avalanche===
Tanguay made his NHL debut on October 5, 1999, against the Nashville Predators and scored his first point that night, recording an assist on a Claude Lemieux goal as part of a 3–2 Colorado win. He scored at least one point in his first five NHL games, including his first NHL goal on October 8 against Peter Skudra of the Pittsburgh Penguins. He was named to play in the YoungStars Game as part of 2002 NHL All-Star weekend, but did not play due to injury. Though he struggled at times adjusting to play in the NHL, he finished the season second in the league amongst rookies with 51 points, 19 behind rookie-leader Scott Gomez.

In his sophomore season of 2000–01, Tanguay improved to 77 points and finished sixth in the NHL in plus/minus at +35. He enjoyed an 11-game point streak in November 2000, scoring six goals and 13 assists in that span. He was a key contributor for the Avalanche in the post-season, recording 21 points. In game seven of the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, Tanguay scored two goals, including the game-winner, and added an assist in a 3–1 victory against the New Jersey Devils. His efforts led Colorado to its second Stanley Cup championship in franchise history.

After falling to 48 points over 70 games in , Tanguay rebounded in to score 67 points. During the season, he had a career best 16-game point streak which set a Colorado team record. He also scored his first career NHL hat trick on March 22, 2003, against the Chicago Blackhawks. He was nearly traded to the Boston Bruins early in the season when both he and the team were struggling. Colorado had offered Tanguay and Martin Škoula to Boston in exchange for Martin Lapointe and Kyle McLaren, though the deal failed to materialize.

He improved to a new personal best of 79 points in , good enough for ninth place in league scoring, while his 54 assists tied him for fourth in the NHL. The league named him to the Western Conference team at the 2004 All-Star Game. While the season was cancelled by a labour dispute, Tanguay signed to play for HC Lugano of the Swiss National League A. He appeared in six games with Lugano, scoring six points. He returned to the Avalanche in , and despite missing ten games late in the year with a knee injury, set a personal best with 29 goals, while his 78 points was one short of his career high. Tanguay scored two goals in an April 15, 2006, game against the Vancouver Canucks to reach 400 points for his career.

Though he was the team&#x27;s second leading scorer, Tanguay continued to be the subject of trade talks throughout the season. Set to become a restricted free agent in July 2006, the Avalanche chose to trade his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for defenceman Jordan Leopold and two second round draft picks. Tanguay felt that the team chose to trade him after he failed to live up to the team&#x27;s expectations in the playoffs even though he continued to struggle with his knee injury. The Flames quickly signed Tanguay to a three-year contract worth US$15.75 million.

===Calgary Flames===

Tanguay enjoyed a career season in , his first in Calgary, scoring a career-high 81 points in 81 games. He was second on the team in scoring, and led the Flames with 57 assists. Additionally, he played in his 500th career game on February 2, 2007, against the Columbus Blue Jackets. The season was a difficult one for Tanguay, as speculation that he would not mesh well with new coach Mike Keenan&#x27;s style resulted in his being the subject of trade rumours throughout the year.

Pre-season fears of a conflict with Keenan were realized, as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was not comfortable with. Unhappy with being pushed into a checking role, and believing that the way Keenan was using him was not allowing him to give the Flames fair value on his contract, Tanguay requested a trade at the Christmas break. He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet so as not to become a distraction to the team, although Tanguay&#x27;s request was revealed in the off-season. He suffered offensively, falling to 58 points.

===Montreal and Tampa Bay===
Two years after being acquired by Calgary in a draft-day trade, he left the Flames in another such deal. At the 2008 NHL Entry Draft on June 20, 2008, the Flames granted his request and sent Tanguay to the Montreal Canadiens, along with a fifth round draft pick, in exchange for a first round pick in 2008 and a second rounder in 2009. Tanguay accepted the trade to Montreal despite previously saying he would never want to play for the Canadiens and expressing worries about being a French-Canadian player in the Montreal spotlight.

Tanguay recovered offensively to begin the season. He was named Montreal&#x27;s player of the month in October after scoring a team-high six goals and 11 assists. He registered his 500th career point with a goal in a November 20 game against the Edmonton Oilers, and entered December as one of the leading vote getters for the 2009 All-Star Game. He ranked third in team-scoring at the end of the month when he suffered a separated left shoulder as a result of a hit by Evgeny Artyukhin of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He missed two months as a result and appeared in a career-low 50 games.

The Canadiens chose not to re-sign Tanguay following the season. He instead agreed to a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning for the season after passing a physical exam on his shoulder. He struggled for most of the season with the Lightning, at one point lamenting that he had &quot;forgotten how to play.&quot; It ended as the worst season of his career, as Tanguay finished with 10 goals, 37 points and had a negative plus-minus (−2) for the first time in his career.
===Return to Calgary===
Tanguay opted to return to Calgary, signing a one-year, $1.7 million contract for the season. He said that the Flames, who were now coached by Brent Sutter, were one of his top choices and that he felt he had unfinished business with the team. Tanguay added that the team expressed confidence in his abilities even as others doubted him following his injuries. The decision proved successful, as Tanguay re-established himself as one of his team&#x27;s top offensive players. He finished second to Jarome Iginla in team scoring with 69 points, and led the Flames with 47 assists. Following the season, the Flames signed him to a five-year contract extension worth $17.5 million.

An upper body injury forced Tanguay out of the Flames&#x27; line-up for 15 games in 2011–12. The team never identified the injury, which was speculated to be a concussion. He still finished third in team scoring, with 49 points in 64 games. Tanguay again finished third in team scoring in the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 NHL season, scoring 27 points in 40 games. On February 2, 2013, in a 3–2 shoot-out defeat to the Chicago Blackhawks, Tanguay registered his 500th career assist on a Dennis Wideman goal. His season was again impacted by injury, as he missed the Flames&#x27; final games of the campaign after suffering a sprained medial collateral ligament in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes.

===Return to Colorado===
With the Flames embracing a rebuild of the team, on June 27, 2013, Tanguay was traded back to his original club, the Colorado Avalanche, along with Cory Sarich in exchange for Shane O&#x27;Brien and David Jones. In his homecoming game with the Avalanche in their season opener for the 2013–14 season, Tanguay posted 3 assists in a 6–1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks. He was instrumental in Colorado&#x27;s league best start to the season until he suffered a knee injury after 13 games in a contest against the Montreal Canadiens on November 2, 2013. Tanguay missed the next 36 games before returned to play on January 24, 2014, against the Florida Panthers. Tanguay was limited to just 3 further appearances with the club before he was ruled out for the remainder of the season to undergo hip surgery on February 21, 2014. In his 16 games, Tanguay totalled 11 points and helped the Avalanche to a 15–1 record when in the line-up.

In the final season of his contract with the Avalanche in 2015–16, Tanguay struggled to retain his offensive role in the top six, registering just 4 goals in 52 games. On February 29, 2016 Tanguay was traded to the Arizona Coyotes along with Conner Bleackley and Kyle Wood in exchange for Mikkel Bødker. He made a successful transition and played out the season in contributing with 13 points in 18 games.

As an unrestricted free agent over the following summer, Tanguay proceeded to go un-signed into the 2016–17 season. On February 16, 2017, he officially noted his retirement from professional hockey in accepting a Studio analyst role for the NHL Network.

==Post-playing career==
On July 23, 2019, Tanguay was named assistant coach for the Iowa Wild of the AHL. 

On June 30, 2021, Tanguay was named assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings, after two seasons with the Wild.

==Playing style==
Tanguay is best known for his playmaking skills and ability to set his teammates up for scoring opportunities. His speed and passing skills are considered his strongest attributes. Calgary teammates Olli Jokinen and Jarome Iginla both praised his ability to find a way to pass the puck to them in difficult plays.

Tanguay has been criticized for not shooting the puck enough, resulting in the view that his goal totals could be higher. Tanguay has good shooting ability; he led the league in shooting percentage in 2005–06 and finished third in 2006–07 with an average of 23.2% both seasons. He is also a top player in the shootout, and led the league with 10 shootout goals in 2010–11.

==Personal life==
Tanguay was born on November 21, 1979, in the town of Sainte-Justine, Quebec. His father worked with the family-owned transportation company, while his mother worked at a nearby school division. His younger brother, Maxime, is also a professional hockey player. Tanguay is distantly related to French-Canadian author, and fellow Sainte-Justine native, Roch Carrier.

Tanguay grew up a fan of the Quebec Nordiques and frequently accompanied his grandfather to their games. Owing to the nature of the Battle of Quebec rivalry with the Canadiens that existed when he was growing up, Tanguay admitted unease at joining the Canadiens in 2008.

Tanguay and his wife Helene have three children, Maya, Sam, and Blake. The two volunteer with the Canadian Cancer Society; in the 2010–11 season, he donated $200 for every assist he recorded. With 47 assists, the total reached $9,400; Tanguay established at the beginning of the season, however, that he would donate a minimum of $10,000.

<text>Keith Matthew Tkachuk (; born March 28, 1972) is an American former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) in a 18-year career with the Winnipeg Jets, Phoenix Coyotes, St. Louis Blues and Atlanta Thrashers, retiring in 2010. He is one of five American-born players to score 500 goals, and is the sixth American player to score 1,000 points. Tkachuk is considered to be among the elite power forwards of his era, and is considered one of the best American-born players to play in the NHL. One of 48 NHL players to have scored 500 goals, Tkachuk remains one of only four eligible players to not be a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.

He is the father of Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, who play for the Florida Panthers and the Ottawa Senators, respectively.

== Playing career ==
===Early career/background===
Tkachuk was born at the Melrose/Wakefield Hospital in Melrose, Massachusetts, grew up in Medford, Massachusetts and played high school hockey at Malden Catholic High School in Malden, Massachusetts. Tkachuk played one season of collegiate hockey at Boston University, was a member of the United States national junior team in 1991 and 1992 and a member of Team USA in 1992. He was drafted in the first round, 19th overall, in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the Winnipeg Jets, who acquired the pick from the Buffalo Sabres in the deal that sent Dale Hawerchuk to Buffalo. Tkachuk played as a center, left winger and right winger in his career.

Tkachuk has earned the nickname &quot;Walt&quot; (given to him by Eddie Olczyk), possibly in reference to Walter Tkaczuk, a star center who played for the New York Rangers from 1967 to 1981. The two players&#x27; last names are pronounced similarly but spelled differently (being the Polish and English transliterations, respectively, of the Ukrainian &quot;Ткачук&quot;), and the two men are not related to each other. With his strong play in front of the net, using his size and strength to battle opposing defensemen, St. Louis Blues broadcasters and fans dubbed Tkachuk &quot;Big Walt.&quot;

=== Winnipeg Jets (1992–1996) ===
Only days after the end of the 1992 Winter Olympics, Tkachuk made his NHL debut on February 28, 1992, against the Vancouver Canucks, where he tallied an assist. He would finish the season playing with the Jets, scoring eight points in 17 games. In the Stanley Cup playoffs that year, he scored three goals in seven games. The following season, 1992–93, was Tkachuk&#x27;s official rookie year. He appeared in 83 games and ended the season with 28 goals and 51 points, including a 12–game scoring streak from March 9 to April 3, 1993.

Tkachuk became the team captain the next season on November 3, 1993, two weeks after recording his first hat-trick, against the Philadelphia Flyers. Some of his accomplishments from that season include leading the Jets in goals (41), points (81) and power-play goals (22). The 1994–95 season, which was shortened by a labor lockout, saw Tkachuk earn all-star second-team honors, as well as being second on the Jets in points scored.

====1995-96 season====

By the end of the 1994-95 season, it was clear that the Jets were in a dire financial situation. While this eventually resulted in the franchise being sold to Minnesota-based interests, serious efforts to keep the team in Winnipeg were still ongoing during the 1995 off-season. Tkachuk, a restricted free agent at the time, requested a trade and made it clear he would not re-sign with Winnipeg under any circumstances. While the Jets attempted to negotiate a deal with several teams, a trade could not be finalized.

While the then-new collective bargaining agreement allowed restricted free agents to negotiate directly with other teams, Tkachuk was initially reluctant to sign an offer sheet since Winnipeg would have the right to match it. Eventually however, frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiations, the Chicago Blackhawks persuaded Tkachuk to sign a front-loaded five-year offer sheet worth $17 million, with $6 million due in the first season. However, to the disappointment of both the Blackhawks and Tkachuk, any assumption that the organization&#x27;s poor financial situation would preclude them from meeting such obligations quickly proved incorrect as the Jets matched the offer-sheet within six hours.

Due to the contract dispute, Tkachuk was stripped of the captaincy and replaced by Kris King; nonetheless, he set a career-high 50 goals and 98 points, the closest he ever came to reaching the 100-point plateau. Tkachuk also led the Jets in power play goals (20), game-winning goals (6), shots (249) and plus-minus rating (+11).

Going up against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings, the Jets lost in six games, with Tkachuk scoring a goal and two assists in the series. After losing Game 6 by a score of 4–1, the final Jets game in the city of Winnipeg before relocating to Phoenix, Tkachuk led the Jets in a final skate around Winnipeg Arena in appreciation of the fans.

=== Phoenix Coyotes (1996–2001) ===

After negotiations to move to Minnesota collapsed, the Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1996. Tkachuk moved with the team, remaining a member of the newly named Phoenix Coyotes. He was also re-appointed captain, replacing Kris King. It was with Phoenix during the 1996–97 season that he had his career-best 52 goals, and made his first appearance in the NHL All-Star Game. He also led the team in goals, points, power-play goals, game-winning goals and shots for the 1997–98 season, earning him his second-straight All-Star appearance. For the 1998–99 season, Tkachuk led the team in goals, power-play goals, game-winning goals, shots and plus-minus, and again was named to the All-Star Game. In 1997, Tkachuk appeared on the front cover of the video game &quot;NHL Breakaway &#x27;98&quot;. He is also a superstar in Gretzky ‘98 winning 2 BOARDS with Phoenix. During the 1998 Nagano Olympics, Tkachuk was also a central figure in the trashing of a hotel room.

After struggling with injuries for the next two seasons, the Coyotes traded Tkachuk to the St. Louis Blues in 2001 in exchange for Ladislav Nagy, Michal Handzuš, Jeff Taffe and a first-round draft pick (Ben Eager), where he was re-united with former teammate Dallas Drake, who had signed a free agent deal with the Blues in the summer of 2000. Tkachuk would leave the Coyotes ranking second in all-time goals (323) and first in penalty minutes (1,508), among other records.

=== St. Louis Blues (2001–2007) ===

Tkachuk made an immediate impact on the Blues, scoring six goals and eight points in the final 12 games of the 2000–01 season. The Blues made it to the Western Conference Final in the playoffs that season, ultimately losing to the Colorado Avalanche, the eventual 2001 Stanley Cup champions. Tkachuk experienced several injuries while playing with the Blues, and was briefly suspended by the team when he reported to training camp overweight, failing his physical at the beginning of the 2005–06 season.

=== Atlanta Thrashers (2007) ===
On February 25, 2007, Tkachuk was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for Glen Metropolit, a first-round pick in 2007, a third-round pick in 2007 and a second-round pick in 2008.

=== Return to St. Louis (2007–2010) ===

On June 26 of the same year, St. Louis reacquired Tkachuk, along with a conditional fourth-round draft pick, in exchange for a conditional first-round pick in 2008. (If Tkachuk had re-signed with the Thrashers, the Blues would have acquired Atlanta&#x27;s first-round pick in 2008.) Since the Blues acquired exclusive negotiating rights with Tkachuk and re-signed him to a two-year deal, Atlanta received a conditional fourth-round pick in 2008.
Tkachuk signed a new, two-year contract with the Blues for $8 million on June 30. Upon re-signing, Tkachuk said of the Blues, &quot;I see a lot of good things happening... They&#x27;re going to be very active in making this a better hockey team.&quot; To help prove the Blues would be better, after signing Tkachuk, they signed left winger Paul Kariya. Blues Head Coach Andy Murray announced that he would try a line where Tkachuk would be centering Kariya on left wing and Brad Boyes on the right.

On the last day of the 2007–08 regular season, April 6, Tkachuk scored his 500th NHL goal, a milestone only three other American-born players have achieved, as well as the 41st player to reach the milestone in NHL history.

On November 30, 2008, Tkachuk scored goal number 511, giving him 1,000 NHL points for his career. He became only the sixth American, and 72nd overall, to achieve that milestone; it came in his 1,077th NHL game. He signed a one-year contract extension with the Blues on June 19, 2009. On April 7, 2010, Tkachuk announced that he would be retiring from hockey at the conclusion of the 2009–10 season. He played his final NHL game two nights later on April 9, 2010.

==Style of play==
One of the elite power forwards of his era, Tkachuk was known for his aggressive, physical style while consistently scoring points. Tkachuk had more than 100 penalty minutes in 10 of his 19 NHL seasons, including three seasons with over 200 penalty minutes. Tkachuk was known for his goal-scoring prowess, scoring 30 goals eight times, including two 40-goal seasons and two back-to-back 50 goal seasons, the latter of which he led the NHL in goals, with 52.

== Personal life ==
Tkachuk has been married to Chantal Oster, a native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, since February 28, 1997. Their two sons, Matthew and Brady, play in the NHL, and their daughter, Taryn, is an NCAA Division I field hockey player with the University of Virginia.

Tkachuk is of Ukrainian and Irish ancestry. He is a cousin of former NHL player and current General Manager of the New Jersey Devils, Tom Fitzgerald, as well as a cousin of NHL player Kevin Hayes and his brother, Jimmy Hayes. Tkachuk&#x27;s brother-in-law is NHL player agent Craig Oster, who represents numerous NHL players including Erik Karlsson, Mark Stone and Evgeny Kuznetsov.

<text>Erik Nicklas Lidström (; born 28 April 1970) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman and current vice president of hockey operations for the Detroit Red Wings. He played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings from 1991 to 2012, which he captained for the final six seasons of his career. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defencemen in NHL history and nicknamed &quot;the Perfect Human.&quot;

Over his 20 NHL seasons, Lidström won four Stanley Cup championships, seven James Norris Memorial Trophies (awarded to the NHL&#x27;s top defenceman), one Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff most valuable player, and was voted into 12 NHL All-Star Games. The Red Wings never missed the playoffs during his career, the longest streak of playoff appearances for a player in league history. Lidström was the first European-born-and-trained captain of a Stanley Cup-winning team, as well as the first European player named playoff MVP. Lidström is also the all-time leader in games played with a single NHL team by a European-born player.

Lidström was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2014. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on 9 November 2015. In 2017, Lidström was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

== Playing career ==
Widely considered one of the greatest defencemen of all time, Lidström was awarded the Norris Trophy seven times, a feat matched by only two other players: Doug Harvey and by Bobby Orr (who won the trophy eight times). Lidström was nominated for the award a total of 12 times in his last 14 seasons in the NHL, the first three times finishing as the runner-up, and won it in seven of his last ten (2004–05 had no winner due to the NHL lockout). In his final 16 seasons (beginning in 1995–96), he finished no lower than sixth place in Norris Trophy voting.

Lidström played his entire 20-year NHL career with the Detroit Red Wings, finishing his career with the second-most Stanley Cup playoff games played in NHL history, with 263 appearances (Chris Chelios ranks first with 266). He was a member of four Stanley Cup-winning teams, in 1996–97, 1997–98, 2001–02 and 2007–08. Save for the cancelled 2004–05 season lockout year, Lidström played in the playoffs for an NHL record 20 consecutive seasons (an honour he shares with Larry Robinson).

Known for his durability, Lidström consistently ranked amongst the top in the NHL in ice time per game. He averaged 28:07 minutes in the 2005–06 season, a career-high. He won three consecutive Norris Trophies from 2001 to 2003 to become the first defenceman since Bobby Orr to win three straight. In the 2003–04 season, he played in the 1,000th game of his career, having missed only 17 games in seasons (1994–95 was shortened to 48 games instead of the usual 82 by a labour dispute).

In the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs, Lidström was named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player during the playoffs, becoming the first European to ever be awarded the trophy.

=== Early career ===
Lidström began his career in Avesta, Sweden, playing with Skogsbo SK, before moving on to play with VIK Västerås HK of the Swedish Elitserien. In three seasons with the team, he played in 103 games, scoring 12 goals and 30 assists. Drafted by the Detroit Red Wings 53rd overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, Lidström joined the team in the 1991–92 season, though he returned to play for Västerås IK for a brief period during the 1994–95 NHL lockout. Lidström scored 60 points in his rookie season, finishing second to Pavel Bure in voting for that year&#x27;s Calder Trophy. He was selected to the 1992 NHL All-Rookie Team, along with fellow Red Wings defenceman Vladimir Konstantinov.

=== NHL career (1991–2012) ===
Lidström was set to make $10 million during the 2005–06 season. However, due to the new terms of the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement that was implemented during the 2004–05 season, salaries on pre-existing contracts were reduced by 24%, which lowered his compensation to $7.6 million. That season, he posted a career-high 64 assists and 16 goals to for 80 points.

On 30 June 2006, it was announced that Lidström had signed a two-year, $15.2 million contract extension with the Red Wings. Instead of seeking more money elsewhere, Lidström decided to remain with Detroit for the same annual salary as he earned during the 2005–06 season.

Lidström was an alternate captain of the Red Wings since the 1997–98 season, but was awarded the captaincy after the 2006 retirement of long-time Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman. It was an honour made more special by the fact that he became the first European captain in franchise history. In his first year of captaincy, Lidström led the Red Wings to the Western Conference Finals, but lost to eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Anaheim Ducks. In the off-season, Lidström joined an elite group by capturing the Norris Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s outstanding defenceman for the fifth time. Lidström became the fourth defenceman in NHL history with as many as five Norris Trophy wins, joining Hockey Hall of Famers Bobby Orr (eight), Doug Harvey (seven) and Ray Bourque (five).

Near the beginning of the 2007–08 season, in an 8 October win against the Edmonton Oilers, Lidström registered two assists to surpass Peter Forsberg as the second-highest scoring Swedish-born NHL player of all-time. Accordingly, he trails only Mats Sundin (as of the end of the 2011–12 season, Lidström has 1,142 points to Sundin&#x27;s 1,349). Later in the season, on 26 December, Lidström signed a contract extension through the 2009–10 season. Several months later, on 3 April 2008, he assisted on a goal by Johan Franzén to tie Luc Robitaille at 42nd in the all-time NHL assists, with 726.

Entering the playoffs as Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners for the highest team point total during the regular season, the Red Wings met the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals. Despite a Game 5, triple-overtime victory by the Penguins to stave off elimination, Lidström and the Red Wings defeated Pittsburgh in Game 6 to capture the Stanley Cup. In doing so, Lidström became the first European-born-and-trained captain to win the Stanley Cup. In 1934, Charlie Gardiner, a goaltender born in Scotland, had captained the Chicago Black Hawks to win the Stanley Cup and in 1938, Johnny Gottselig, a left-winger born in Russia, also captained Chicago to a championship, but both players were trained in Canada.

Just over one week after winning his fourth Stanley Cup in 11 seasons, on 12 June, Lidström won the Norris Trophy for the third-straight season and the sixth time in seven seasons.

As the Red Wings opened the 2008–09 pre-season against the Montreal Canadiens, Lidström suffered a broken nose as a shot from Canadiens forward Chris Higgins ricocheted and hit him in the face. From then on, he began wearing a visor. He returned in time for the regular season and was selected to the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal. However, in the midst of dealing with tendinitis that had been bothering him all season, Lidström chose to sit out All-Star weekend, along with teammate Pavel Datsyuk. Consequently, Lidström and Datsyuk were both suspended one game by the NHL due to League policy for missing the All-Star Game without significant injury. On 22 May, in Game 3 of the third round of the 2009 playoffs against the Chicago Blackhawks, Lidström suffered a testicle injury as a result of getting speared in the groin area by Blackhawks&#x27; winger Patrick Sharp, requiring surgery to remove the damaged testicle. He would miss the last two games of the series which the Red wings would defeat the Blackhawks in five games for a second consecutive appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lidstrom would return for the Finals. However, unlike the previous matchup, the Red Wings would lose the series in seven games, one win short of a second consecutive Stanley Cup and fifth altogether, despite initially having a 3–2 series lead.

The Red Wings opened the 2009–10 season in Stockholm, Sweden. During the team&#x27;s trip in Sweden, Lidström was honored by his home county, Dalarna, as an Ambassador of Honor. On 15 October 2009, in a game against the Los Angeles Kings, Lidström became the first European-born defenceman to reach 1,000 points after recording two assists in the game. He is the fourth player to score 1,000 points as a Red Wing (after Gordie Howe, Alex Delvecchio and Steve Yzerman), and the eighth defenceman to do so in the history of the NHL. On 5 March 2010, Lidström earned his 800th career assist. Also during the 2009–10 season, Lidström played in his 1,395th game (finishing the season with 1,412), setting an all-time record for NHL games played by a player born in Europe; earlier in the season, Lidström had passed Teppo Numminen for games played by a player trained in Europe. Lidström is also second all-time in games played in a Red Wing uniform, behind only Howe. On 23 April, Lidström played in his 237th career playoff game, moving past Mark Messier into sole possession of third place on the NHL&#x27;s all-time list (Chris Chelios, 266; Patrick Roy, 247). In the same game, he had an assist to tie Al MacInnis (121) for the third-most assists in the post-season by a defenceman (Ray Bourque 139; Paul Coffey 137). On 27 April, a day before his 40th birthday, Lidström had three points in a Game 7 win over the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round of the 2010 playoffs, pushing his active playoff points lead to 171 points, and tying him for 17th on the all-time playoff points list with fellow countryman Peter Forsberg. After defeating the Coyotes in game seven to take the series in seven games, the Red Wings would go on to lose in the second round in five games against the Shan Jose Sharks.

As of the end of the 2009–10 season, Lidström has missed only 28 of a possible 1,440 regular-season team games (one due to suspension).

After contemplating retirement, Lidström agreed on a one-year contract with the Red Wings on 1 June 2010; the contract paid him slightly over $6 million. On 15 December 2010, Lidström recorded his first career hat-trick, at 40 years of age, against the St. Louis Blues, sealing a 5–2 Detroit victory. After the game, he was asked how it feels to score his first hat-trick, responding, &quot;It feels great, I&#x27;ve never in my life been able to notch three goals in a game.&quot; The hat-trick made him the oldest player in NHL history to record his first hat-trick (previously held by Scott Mellanby at 36 years of age), and the oldest defenceman in NHL history to record a hat-trick (previously held by Mathieu Schneider at 37 years of age). On 18 January 2011, Lidström was named a team captain in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game in Raleigh, North Carolina. His team won by a final score of 11–10 over Team Staal, captained by Eric Staal of the Carolina Hurricanes. Lidström finished +7 with one assist.

On 20 June 2011, after briefly contemplating retirement yet again, Lidström signed a one-year contract worth $6.2 million with Detroit, the same amount he had been paid the previous season. On 23 June 2011, he won his seventh Norris Trophy even though his plus/minus rating for the year was −2, tying with Doug Harvey and remaining one behind Bobby Orr for most Norris Trophies. This was only the third time in history that a player with a negative plus/minus rating won the Norris Trophy.

On 22 October 2011, in a game against the Washington Capitals, Lidström became the 14th player in the history of the NHL to play 1,500 games. He is the first player not being born in North America, and therefore the first Swedish and European player, as well as the first player to accomplish this in his 20th NHL season. Lidström played in his 1,550th game on 12 February 2012, against the Philadelphia Flyers, surpassing Alex Delvecchio&#x27;s previous Red Wing record of 1,549 games. This also makes him the NHL player who has played the most games while always playing for the same NHL team (Gordie Howe played more games, 1,687, with the Red Wings, but also played for the Hartford Whalers for one season). In this regard, Lidström joins former Red Wings Alex Delvecchio and Steve Yzerman as the only three players with over 1,500 games having played exclusively for just one team throughout their careers.

=== Retirement ===

On 31 May 2012, Lidström announced his retirement from the NHL via a press conference with Red Wings Owner Mike Ilitch and General Manager Ken Holland present. The night before, he told the Swedish tabloid &quot;Expressen,&quot; &quot;I came to the decision last week and I informed our general manager, Ken Holland.&quot; Discussing Lidström&#x27;s retirement, former teammate Steve Yzerman described Lidström as &quot;one of the all-time best defencemen to ever play.&quot; Former teammate and fellow Norris Trophy winning defenseman Paul Coffey said, &quot;He was an incredible player&quot; while Chris Chelios said, &quot;There&#x27;s been guys who are great players, but no one&#x27;s better than Nick. As good? Yes. But this is as big as it gets. He&#x27;s one of the best athletes ever and...if you&#x27;re going to talk about someone who&#x27;s perfect, Nick&#x27;s pretty darn close to being perfect.&quot; Washington Capitals defenceman John Carlson described Lidström as &quot;one of the game&#x27;s all-time greats on and off the ice.&quot; Ken Holland stated his belief that Lidström was &quot;the most valuable player of his era.&quot;

The following weekend, on 3 June 2012, Lidström and his wife took out a full-page ad giving thanks to the city of Detroit for making his family feel at home for the past 21 years. On 8 July 2012, Lidström was named a scout for the Red Wings.

On 28 February 2014, Lidström was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

During the 2013–14 season, Lidström had his number 5 jersey retired by the Red Wings. Initially, ceremonies were planned for the previous season, on 5 February 2013 — however, the lockout had made it hard to determine when Lidström would be able to attend the ceremony. The Red Wings officially retired his number on 6 March 2014, in a pre-game ceremony at Joe Louis Arena.

== International play ==

Representing Sweden, Lidström won the World Championship in 1991. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Lidström was a major factor in Sweden&#x27;s win over Finland in the finals, scoring the gold medal-clinching goal, thus earning him a spot on the Olympic All-Star team. He also became the 17th member of the Triple Gold Club. &quot;The Hockey News&quot; selected Lidström as the &quot;Best European-trained player ever in the NHL.&quot; The &quot;Sporting News&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; selected Lidström as the &quot;NHL Player of the Decade.&quot;

Prior to his NHL career, Lidström competed in one European Junior Championships in 1988, one World Junior Championship in 1990 and one Canada Cup in 1991 for Sweden.

Prior to his rookie season with the Red Wings, he earned his first gold medal with Sweden at the 1991 World Championships. Three years later, he competed in the 1994 World Championships in Italy and won a bronze medal. Two years later, he participated in the inaugural 1996 World Cup of Hockey (successor of the Canada Cup) and contributed three points in four games. He made his Olympic debut with Sweden at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

Four years later was his next international appearance, playing in his second Olympics at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where Sweden was upset by Belarus in the quarter-final after being heavy favourites in the round-robin. Lidström made his third World Championships appearance in 2004, but only appeared in two games. That summer, he also competed in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, where he scored one goal.

In the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Lidström helped Sweden avenge their quarter-final upset to Belarus in Salt Lake City, scoring the game winning goal in the gold medal game against Finland. In doing so, Lidström became a member of the Triple Gold Club, adding an Olympic gold medal to go with his previous Stanley Cups with Detroit and his World Championship gold medal in 1991. Lidström was also selected to the 2010 Olympic All-Star team.

Lidström also played for Sweden in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, serving as team captain in what would be his final Olympic appearance. Lidström announced his retirement from Olympic competition following Sweden&#x27;s loss to Slovakia.

== Personal life ==
Growing up, Lidström idolized trailblazing defenceman Börje Salming, whom he considers to be his hero. In November 2023, Lidström was the recipient of the inaugural Börje Salming Courage Award, which is given to the European NHL alumnus who has been a positive influence in their community and best embodies Salming&#x27;s legacy.

Lidström is married to Annika, with whom he has four children. All four sons play high-level hockey: Kevin (born 1994), is currently a defenceman for Swedish Division 1 team SK Lejon; Adam (born 1996) also plays in Division 1 with Enköpings SK; Samuel (born in 2000) plays on Elitettan team Köping HC and Lucas (born in 2003) also plays for VIK Västerås HK on its U16 team.

Lidström was featured on an episode of NHL 36.

In October 2019, Lidström released his authorized biography in North America titled &quot;Nicklas Lidstrom: The Pursuit of Perfection&quot;.

<doc id="440461" wikidata="Q4899255" url="?curid=440461" title="Beulah (band)">
<text>Beulah was an American indie rock band from San Francisco, California, often associated with The Elephant 6 Recording Company. The band would go on to gain ample critical acclaim from many well respected publishing companies including Rolling Stone, and The Guardian.

==History==
===Early years: 1996-1998===
The band was formed by Miles Kurosky and Bill Swan in San Francisco in 1996, while the pair were working in the same office. They discovered that they shared similar musical tastes and, disregarding some mutual dislike, decided to form a band. This early incarnation of Beulah recorded a song every six weeks for 16 months on their four-track recorder. The band received attention from The Apples in Stereo frontman and Elephant 6 member Robert Schneider, who expressed interest on releasing what was to be its first single, &quot;A Small Cattle Drive in a Snow Storm&quot;, on Elephant 6 Records. Their first album, &quot;Handsome Western States&quot;, was released in the same year, also on Elephant 6 and mastered by Schneider. The record soon sold out. This association with the collective has continued throughout their career, despite the fact that Beulah did not release anything more on the label. In order to tour in support of the album, Steve La Follette, Steve St. Cin and Pat Noel joined the band, with the band playing its first shows in support of the Apples.

===Middle years: 1999-2002===
Their second album, &quot;When Your Heartstrings Break&quot;, followed two years later to critical acclaim. The sound of the band had changed — as Kurosky put it, the band&#x27;s production values had shifted &quot;from lo-fi to mid-fi&quot;, and it incorporated several dozen instruments, using eighteen additional musicians — strings and horns were heavily incorporated, along with more exotic instrumentation. Also at this time, the band added keyboardist Bill Evans to its line-up. Shifty Disco Records, an Oxford, U.K.,-based label, also released two U.K.-only singles in 1999, &quot;Sunday Under Glass&quot; and &quot;Score From Augusta&quot;, with &quot;Emma Blowgun&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; released the following year. These singles featured b-sides culled from &quot;Handsome Western States&quot;, which remained unreleased in the U.K. and had fallen out of print in the U.S., until 2000 further copies were made available by the band in 1999, with different artwork. &quot;Emma Blowgun&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; was also released in Australia by Elastic Records, with two exclusive bonus tracks.

In 2000, Beulah had a music practice space at the Art Explosion Studios at 2425-17th Street in the Mission District; other bands in this space included Deerhoof, Creeper Lagoon, Zmrzlina, Don&#x27;t Mean Maybe, and S-- S-- Band Band.

The band continued to tour extensively throughout 1999, taking a break in 2000. Steve St. Cin left the band after this and was replaced by Danny Sullivan, best known from his days in Screeching Weasel. Kurosky went to Japan, staying with a friend for eight weeks, and wrote the songs that would eventually turn into Beulah&#x27;s third album. He mailed demo tapes of the songs to each band member, who mailed back their own versions of, and additions to, the songs. This process created interesting juxtapositions in the band&#x27;s songwriting process, as Kurosky described: &quot;Bill might have heard it as a soul song and Pat might have heard it as a country song — and I might happen to like both parts, and use them both&quot;. Kurosky turned these recordings into the basis of the band&#x27;s new record, &quot;The Coast Is Never Clear&quot;. During the recording process, however, Kurosky was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and took daily therapy sessions, which informed the lyrical mood of the record, which was often incredibly downbeat, very much at odds with the breezy, summery feel of the music. This also made the recording of the record difficult — Bill Swan&#x27;s studio diary often contains excerpts such as, &quot;Miles threatened to hit me over the head with a mic stand. This is going to be a long record&quot;. To add to these personal problems, Beulah also encountered other problems with the release of the record, primarily the buy-out of Capricorn Records, which had signed Beulah after &quot;When Your Heartstrings Break&quot; was released. In the end, the record was released on newly founded independent label Velocette Records on Sept. 11, 2001. The record gained a great degree of critical acclaim, and the band continued to tour, despite having to cancel its European dates that winter. Shortly after the release of the record, Steve La Follette and Bill Evans left the band and were replaced by Eli Crews and Pat Abernathy.

===Later years: 2002-2004===
2002 saw the then-out-of-print &quot;Handsome Western States&quot; repressed for the third time, along with another U.S. tour, after which the band settled into rehearsing material for its next album. The period surrounding &quot;Yoko&quot;&#x27;s conception and recording was one of great personal strife for the band: Kurosky separated from his longtime girlfriend, and three of the six band members went through divorce. Amid this, the foundations of the band appeared to be shaking; rumors of a break-up were rife. The mood of the album was much darker and the band phased back much of its instrumentation, preferring to create more of a live sound than layering multiple overdubs atop the mix. The album took a much rockier direction than previous releases; upon its release in 2003, it attracted a similar lauding that had greeted their previous two records. An album of demos, appropriately titled &quot;Yoko Demo&quot;, was released in December.

At this time, Beulah appeared to be falling apart. Cryptic messages alluding to a break-up appeared on the band&#x27;s website, and the band itself stated that, if &quot;Yoko&quot; did not achieve gold status, its members would split. Though it received the best reviews of the band&#x27;s career, scoring Universal Acclaim on Metacritic and being described as a &quot;career-spanning epic&quot; by &quot;Dusted Magazine&quot;, the record failed to achieve gold status. After one final tour, the band split up, ending with a free concert at New York&#x27;s Battery Park at Castle Clinton on August 5, 2004. On August 2, 2005, a DVD chronicling their fall 2003 tour, titled &quot;A Good Band is Easy to Kill&quot; (referring to the band&#x27;s song &quot;A Good Man is Easy to Kill&quot;) was released.

In 2005, all four Beulah albums, as well as the single &quot;My Horoscope Said It Would Be a Bad Year,&quot; were released on iTunes after fans suggested they be easily accessible. 

===Miles Kurosky&#x27;s &quot;Desert of Shallow Effects&quot;===
Miles Kurosky released his first solo album, &quot;The Desert of Shallow Effects&quot;, on March 9, 2010, via Majordomo Records, an imprint of Shout! Factory. Produced by Kurosky and engineered by former Beulah member Eli Crews (Deerhoof, Why?), &quot;The Desert of Shallow Effects&quot; includes a cast of more than two dozen musicians (among them several former Beulah members) playing a vast array of instruments. “When I wrote lyrics before, for Beulah, they were of an esoteric nature, but this time, I wanted them to read like stories,” Kurosky said.

In late 2009, the members of Beulah reunited to perform selections from &quot;The Desert of Shallow Effects&quot; for The Bay Bridged festival.

The 2009 film Youth in Revolt contained the Beulah song &quot;Popular Mechanics for Lovers,&quot; and it also appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

<text>A smoke grenade is a canister-type grenade used as a signaling device, target or landing zone marking device, or as a screening device for unit movements.

Smoke grenades are generally more complex and emit a far larger amount of smoke than smoke bombs, which are a type of firework typically started with an external fuse rather than a pin. Smoke grenades often cost around compared to smoke bombs, which can often cost just a few cents. The phrase &quot;to smoke&quot;, meaning to fake, bluff, or beat around the bush, comes from the military usage of smoke grenades to obscure and conceal movement; similarly, &quot;pop smoke&quot;, derived from a common way of ordering the use of smoke grenades, is used as a slang term for quickly leaving a place.

== Design ==
A typical design consists of a sheet steel cylinder with four emission holes on top and one on the bottom to allow smoke release when the grenade is ignited. The filler consists of 250 to 350 grams of colored smoke composition (mostly potassium chlorate, lactose, and a dye) in virtually any color. White smoke grenades typically use hexachloroethane-zinc and granular aluminum. The reaction is exothermic and though they remain intact, smoke grenade casings will often remain scalding hot for some time even after the grenade is no longer emitting smoke. Although modern smoke grenades are designed not to directly emit fire or sparks, they remain a fire hazard and are capable of igniting dry vegetation or flammable substances if used carelessly.

Another type of smoke grenade is the bursting variation. These are filled with white phosphorus (WP), a pyrophoric agent that is spread quickly into a cloud by an internal bursting charge. White phosphorus burns with a brilliant yellow flame while producing copious amounts of white smoke (phosphorus pentoxide). This type of smoke grenade is favored for its ability to produce a very dense and nearly instantaneous cloud of white concealment smoke as compared to the more common solid-filler grenades which expel a slower stream of smoke over a period of roughly 1 minute. For this reason, they are favored for use in onboard grenade launching attachments on armored vehicles, which require extremely fast concealment in the event they are targeted by anti-armor weaponry and need to rapidly retreat.

== Use ==

Smoke grenades are used for several purposes. The primary use is the creation of smoke screens for concealment and the signaling of aircraft.

If movement (such as flanking maneuvers or retreat) is necessary, smoke grenades can be thrown prior to movement in order to provide a wall of visual distraction that reduces the accuracy of enemy fire and temporarily deceives them as to the force&#x27;s location. 

Smoke grenades can also be used to signal aircraft. Since locating a target from above (especially in thick forest canopy) can be nearly impossible, even with good radio contact, colored smoke grenades are often used to allow aircraft to spot them. Colored signaling smoke grenades are widely used in CASEVAC and close air support situations where quickly locating friendly ground forces is of paramount importance. Common colors are red, yellow, green and purple, and all use very brightly colored dyes to increase the likelihood of being spotted from above.

== Other uses ==
Smoke grenades are functionally identical to many forms of chemical grenades (such as CS gas riot control grenades) and incendiary grenades (such as thermite grenades) which use a fuse to ignite a solid filler inside a steel canister, which then slowly propels the combustion products out through holes in the canister as the contents burn. However, the smoke grenade class is restricted to signaling and concealment under the law of war, and thus they are not considered weapons; since the vast majority are non-explosive, they remain legal for civilian use and ownership in most countries.

Since the basic design of a smoke grenade (a metal canister containing a substance that burns and expels smoke when ignited) is simple, improvised smoke grenade-like devices are ubiquitous across the world. Protestors, football spectators, and airsoft enthusiasts often create their own smoke grenades using common materials.

<text>WWE Raw, also known as Monday Night Raw or simply Raw, is an American professional wrestling television program produced by WWE. It currently airs live every Monday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Netflix. The show features characters from the Raw brand, to which WWE wrestlers are assigned to work and perform. It debuted on January 11, 1993, and is considered to be one of WWE&#x27;s two flagship programs, along with &quot;Friday Night SmackDown&quot;.

Since its first episode, &quot;Raw&quot; has been broadcast live from 209 different arenas, 172 cities and towns, and eleven different nations, mostly in the United States; &quot;Raw&quot; shows have also been broadcast and taped in Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, as well as Afghanistan and Iraq as part of &quot;Tribute to the Troops&quot;.

Debuting on the USA Network television channel, &quot;Raw&quot; moved in September 2000 to TNN, which rebranded to Spike TV in August 2003. On October 3, 2005, &quot;Raw&quot; returned to USA Network, where it remained until January 6, 2025, when it moved to the Netflix streaming platform, which is scheduled to broadcast the program for a period of at least 10 years. The company&#x27;s own WWE Network ceased operations in the United States on April 5, 2021, with all content being moved to Peacock, which had most previous &quot;Raw&quot; episodes until the transition to Netflix in 2025. &quot;Raw&quot; has also been broadcast globally on other networks since it first began.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Beginning as WWF&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Raw,&quot; the program first aired on January 11, 1993, on the USA Network as a replacement for &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, which aired on the network for eight years. The original &quot;Raw&quot; was sixty minutes in length and broke new ground in televised professional wrestling. Traditionally, wrestling shows were pre-taped on sound stages with small audiences or at large arena shows. The &quot;Raw&quot; formula was considerably different from the pre-taped weekend shows that aired at the time such as &quot;Superstars&quot; and &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;. Instead of matches taped weeks in advance with studio voice overs and taped discussion, &quot;Raw&quot; was a show shot and aired to a live audience, with angles and matches playing out as they happened.

&quot;Raw&quot; originated from the Grand Ballroom at the Manhattan Center, a small New York City theater, and aired live each week. The combination of an intimate venue and live action proved to be a successful improvement. However, the weekly live schedule proved to be a financial drain on the WWF. From spring 1993 until spring 1997, &quot;Raw&quot; would tape several week&#x27;s worth of episodes after a live episode had aired. The WWF taped several weeks worth of &quot;Raw&quot; from the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York in April 1993, and again in June and October. The first episode produced outside of New York was taped in Bushkill, Pennsylvania in November 1993 and &quot;Raw&quot; left the Manhattan Center permanently as the show would be taken on the road throughout the United States and had in smaller venues.

=== The Attitude Era and Spike TV ===
On September 4, 1995, the WWF&#x27;s chief competitor World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began airing its new wrestling show, &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, live each week on TNT, which marked the start of the Monday Night War. &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Nitro&quot; went head-to-head for the first time on September 11, 1995. At the start of the ratings war in 1995 through to mid-1996, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Nitro&quot; exchanged victories over each other in a closely contested rivalry. Beginning in mid-1996, however, due to the nWo angle, &quot;Nitro&quot; started a ratings win-streak that lasted for 84 consecutive weeks, ending on April 13, 1998. On February 3, 1997, &quot;Raw&quot; went to a two-hour format, to compete with the extra hour on &quot;Nitro&quot; (which had been expanded to two hours in the spring of 1996), and by March 10, it was renamed to &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. It was also during the time &quot;Raw&quot; would be aired live more often. After WrestleMania XIV in March 1998, the WWF regained the lead in the Monday Night War with its new &quot;WWF Attitude&quot; brand. The April 13, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, which was headlined by a match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vince McMahon, marked the first time that &quot;Nitro&quot; had lost the head-to-head Monday night ratings battle in the 84 weeks since 1996.

On January 4, 1999, Mick Foley, who had wrestled for WCW during the early 1990s as Cactus Jack, won the WWF Championship as Mankind on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. On orders from Eric Bischoff, &quot;Nitro&quot; announcer Tony Schiavone gave away this previously taped result on a live &quot;Nitro&quot; and then sarcastically added, &quot;That&#x27;s gonna put some butts in the seats&quot;, consequently resulting in over 600,000 viewers switching channels to &quot;Raw Is War&quot; to see the underdog capture the WWF Championship. This was also the night that &quot;Nitro&quot; aired a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match in which Kevin Nash laid down for Hollywood Hogan after Hogan poked him in the chest.

On June 28, 2000, Viacom won the landmark deal with the WWF to move all of its WWF programs stemming from the lawsuit action against WWF from USA Network. The new television contract and the subsequent purchase of competitor WCW led to many changes in WWF&#x27;s programming content. &quot;Raw Is War&quot; premiered on TNN on September 25, 2000.

WCW&#x27;s sharp decline in revenue and ratings led to AOL Time Warner selling selected assets such as the WCW name, tape library, and contracts to the WWF in March 2001 for $3 million. The final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, which aired on March 26, 2001, began with Vince McMahon making a short statement about his recent purchase of WCW and ended with a simulcast with &quot;Raw&quot; on TNN and &quot;Nitro&quot; on TNT including an appearance by Vince&#x27;s son Shane. The younger McMahon interrupted his father&#x27;s gloating over the WCW purchase to explain that Shane was the one who actually owned WCW, setting up what became the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Invasion&quot; storyline. Following the purchase of WCW and the September 11 attacks, the program was retitled as &quot;Raw&quot; on October 1, 2001, permanently retiring the &quot;Raw Is War&quot; moniker in prelude to the upcoming United States invasion of Afghanistan.

In March 2002, as a result of the overabundance of talent left over from the Invasion storyline, WWF instituted a process known as the &quot;brand extension&quot;, under which &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; would be treated as two distinct divisions, each with their own rosters and championships. Shortly thereafter, the WWF was legally required to change the name of the company to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

=== Return to USA Network ===

On March 10, 2005, Viacom and WWE decided not to go on with the agreement with Spike TV (formerly TNN, now Paramount Network), effectively ending &quot;Raw&quot; and other WWE programs&#x27; tenure on Spike TV when their deal expired in September 2005. On April 4, 2005, WWE announced a three-year deal with NBCUniversal to bring &quot;Raw&quot; back to its former home, USA Network, with two yearly specials on NBC and a Spanish &quot;Raw&quot; on Telemundo. On the same week as &quot;Raw&quot;″s return to USA Network, Spike TV scheduled Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)&#x27;s live &quot;Ultimate Fight Night&quot; in &quot;Raw&quot;&#x27;s old timeslot in an attempt to go head-to-head with &quot;Raw&quot;.

Since the return to USA Network, &quot;Raw&quot; has been pre-empted during the U.S. Open, which aired on USA, resulting in &quot;Raw&quot; to be moved to SciFi, a sister channel to USA, for three years. Since 2016, the two-hour version of that week&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; has aired on Syfy. In February 2022, Raw temporarily moved to Syfy for two episodes due to USA&#x27;s coverage (as part of NBC Sports) of the 2022 Winter Olympics.

On the August 29, 2011 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was announced that performers from &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; were no longer exclusive to their respective brand, thus effectively dissolving the brand extension. On July 23, 2012, &quot;Raw&quot; aired its 1,000th episode, which also began its permanent three-hour format. On January 14, 2013, &quot;Raw&quot; celebrated its 20th year on the air. On May 25, 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand split, and a new set with red ring ropes, a brand new stage, used at SummerSlam. Furthermore, the broadcast table was moved to the entrance ramp similar to how it was in 2002–2005. On January 22, 2018, WWE celebrated the 25th anniversary of Raw with a simulcast show at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the home of the first Monday Night Raw, the Manhattan Center. On the February 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, six days before Elimination Chamber, seven participants of the men&#x27;s Elimination Chamber match, Braun Strowman, Elias, Finn Bálor, John Cena, Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and The Miz, were involved in a Gauntlet match that began with Reigns and Rollins. Strowman won the Gauntlet match by pinning The Miz in what was the longest match in WWE history, lasting nearly two hours.

From March 12, 2020, to August 18, 2020, WWE announced that all of its live programs would air from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida without an audience until further notice beginning with the following day&#x27;s episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in the suspension of many professional sports leagues. On the May 25 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; NXT trainees were added into live crowds at the Performance Center. In August, all programming was moved to the new, state-of-the-art WWE ThunderDome inside of the Amway Center in Orlando. On May 21, 2021, WWE announced that they will return in front of live fans with a 25 city tour, therefore the July 12, 2021 edition of Raw would be the final WWE ThunderDome show.

=== Move to Netflix ===
In September 2023, USA Network announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot; would return to the network in October 2024 after the expiration of its contract with Fox; it was concurrently reported that the rights to &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;NXT&quot; were on the market with heavy interest among linear networks and digital properties.

On January 23, 2024, TKO Group announced that Netflix would acquire the rights to &quot;Raw&quot; beginning in January 2025, in what was reported to be a 10-year deal worth $500 million per-year (roughly double the value of WWE&#x27;s current agreement with NBCUniversal). The agreement will initially cover the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Latin America, with other territories to be added in the future. The agreement also gives Netflix rights to all WWE programming outside of the United States (replacing WWE Network), including weekly shows, archive content, and live events. While USA Network&#x27;s contract for &quot;Raw&quot; was to expire in October 2024, WWE reached a short-term extension of its agreement with NBCUniversal to keep &quot;Raw&quot; on the network through the end of the year. From October 7 through December 30, &quot;Raw&quot; was shortened from three to two hours; wrestling reporter Dave Meltzer stated that this was a request made by USA Network.

With the move to streaming, WWE chief content officer Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque said that the length of the show on Netflix will be &quot;flexible&quot;, and no longer bound to a set runtime as with shows carried on linear television. When asked about the average runtime of each episode, he responded that &quot;for me, the perfect show time is somewhere in the two-and-a-half-hour range. If you had asked me years ago, the two hour shows, you get into them and you don&#x27;t have the real estate on that program to get everything in there you want to get in, all the stories and characters. Sometimes, it&#x27;s a good thing because it creates scarcity and opportunity for people to be more over, but sometimes there are things you want to get in there.&quot;

== Production ==
&quot;Raw&quot;″s original set featured red, white, and blue ring-ropes, a blue ring-apron, blue steps, and a small stage made of neon light tubes. In 1995, the entrance way was changed to feature &quot;Raw&quot; in giant letters. Beginning on March 10, 1997, broadcasts of &quot;Raw&quot; were split into two hour-long blocks, each given its own name for television ratings purposes. The first hour was referred to as &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, and the second became known as &quot;War Zone&quot;. These changes were reflected in television listings and, beginning with the June 9, 1997 episode, by the show&#x27;s on-screen graphics. &quot;War Zone&quot; initially opened with a repeat of the Raw intro, punctuated with the War Zone logo. On November 24, 1997, the hour received its own distinct opening video, a remixed version of the typical Raw opening.

In 1997, the WWF changed the color of the ring-ropes to red and began printing &quot;Raw Is War&quot; along the ring in reference to their rivalry with WCW. The stages was updated to feature a 70-foot tall large screen video wall known as the &quot;TitanTron&quot;, which consisted of a projection screen with several metal stage trusses and a video projector. The set also initially featured curtains on each side with truss beams and lighting later bearing the &quot;WWF Attitude&quot; banner on the sides. By 1999, the WWF placed a &quot;WWF.com: &#x27;Download This!&#x27;&quot; logo on the bottom of the TitanTron and added two vertical sides on the stage along with a USA Network logo on top of the TitanTron.

&quot;Raw&quot; moved to TNN from USA beginning with the September 25, 2000 episode. The TNN network logo was added atop the TitanTron on the December 11, 2000 episode. Chyron graphics were added to the bottom beginning with the July 2, 2001 episode.

Beginning October 1, 2001, in direct response to the September 11 attacks, the first hour was referred to as &quot;Raw&quot; instead of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, and the second hour was rebranded from the &quot;War Zone&quot; to the &quot;Raw Zone&quot; within the show&#x27;s on-screen graphics. The Monday Night War had ended months earlier with the WWF&#x27;s purchase of the competing WCW brand. &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, which had once gone head-to-head with &quot;Raw&quot;, aired its final show in March. WWF announcers began generally referring to the entire two-hour block as &quot;Raw&quot; on-air. &quot;Raw&quot; updated to a new, industrial-inspired, parallelogram-shaped TitanTron in 2002. Ring apron lettering that had once born &quot;Raw Is War&quot; slogan was replaced with an advertisement for the WWF website. Around this time, black ring-ropes were occasionally used. Like the previous set, the TNN logo was relocated to the bottom side of the TitanTron. It was subsequently replaced by the Spike TV logo on August 11, 2003, upon network relaunch. During the July 25, 2005 broadcast of &quot;Raw&quot; in Cleveland, Ohio, a special stage design was built for the John Cena-Chris Jericho Battle of the Bands concert.

The 2002 set was designed by Production Designer Jason Robinson. It featured a larger TitanTron with dimensions of 55 feet wide by 25 feet tall. The expanded structure weighed about 4,000 pounds and requiring three 18,000-watt projector screens to power itself. According to Eric Bischoff on a 2003 episode of &quot;WWE Confidential&quot;, the show utilized 13 cameras at the time at a cost of $85,000.

On October 3, 2005, as &quot;Raw&quot; returned to USA Network, the 2002 set was retained but the beams and lighting on the sides were modified. The Spike TV logo was removed from the bottom side of the TitanTron. On October 9, 2006, the show debuted a new logo and opening intro featuring &quot;...To Be Loved&quot; by Papa Roach as its theme song. This logo and intro were retained until November 9, 2009, a period that also saw the changeover to broadcasting &quot;Raw&quot; in high-definition, which occurred on January 21, 2008.

From November 16, 2009, to July 16, 2012, the theme song for the &quot;Raw&quot; brand was &quot;Burn It to the Ground&quot; by Nickelback. Prior to this, the theme song for &quot;Raw&quot; was &quot;...To Be Loved&quot; by Papa Roach, which had been used since October 9, 2006 and &quot;Across The Nation&quot; by The Union Underground which was used from April 1, 2002, to October 2, 2006. The rock and roll outro of &quot;Thorn In Your Eye&quot; featuring Scott Ian of Anthrax was the theme song from March 31, 1997, to March 25, 2002.

On May 17, 2012, WWE and USA Network announced that &quot;Raw&quot; would switch to a permanent three-hour format beginning with the 1,000th episode on July 23, 2012. Since then, all three hours of the broadcast have been known solely as &quot;Raw&quot;, though they are still considered three separate programs for Nielsen ratings purposes (as indicated by the on-screen copyright notice shown near the end of each hour). In 2010, WWE retired the red ropes for &quot;Raw&quot; after thirteen years for an all white scheme, which in 2012 became standard for all WWE programming. In 2012, &quot;Raw&quot; updated their HD set.

Beginning in mid-2014, this set would also be featured in pay-per-views. From late September through the end of October 2012, the middle rope at all WWE programming was changed to pink due to WWE&#x27;s alliance with the Susan G. Komen organization for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This was repeated in 2013, from late September to early November, and it was repeated in 2014 from September 29. WWE is one of many organizations who provide financial contributions to the organization in addition to raising awareness among its staff and consumers.

On August 18, 2014, &quot;Raw&quot; switched to a full 16:9 letterbox widescreen presentation, with a down-scaled version of the native HD feed on a 4:3 SD feed. In conjunction with this, &quot;Raw&quot; updated its graphics package, with the new WWE logo (first used with the WWE Network&#x27;s launch in February) now on the lower-right corner of the screen, right next to the word, &quot;Live&quot;. At this time, the new WWE logo began appearing on the ring&#x27;s turnbuckle covers, and USA Network logo moved to the lower-left hand corner of the screen. Additionally, &quot;Raw&quot;″s theme song (&quot;The Night&quot;) was modified.

On March 23, 2015, WWE added a small LED board to the left side of the ring on &quot;Raw&quot;. This LED board was also used at WrestleMania 31. The LED board has since been featured on a sporadic basis, appearing in some weeks and being absent in others. On the 1,000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;The Night&quot; by Kromestatik debuted as the theme for &quot;Raw&quot;. &quot;Energy&quot; by Shinedown served as the secondary theme-song until August 18, 2014, when it was replaced with &quot;Denial&quot; by We Are Harlot.

On the September 14, 2015 season premiere of &quot;Raw&quot;, the middle rope was colored gold. Throughout the month of October 2015, the program once again partnered with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to promote Breast Cancer Awareness Month, with various stage elements being made pink. On the November 16, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, WWE had a moment of silence for the victims of the terrorist attack in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015. Another moment of silence was held months later in June for the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting.

On July 25, 2016, the ropes returned to red, the announce table moved back to the top of the stage for the first time since 2005, and a new HD set and graphics were debuted. The new set was almost identical to the set used for SummerSlam 2012 and 2013. After some fans responded negatively to the redesign, the set was revamped four weeks later with a more elaborate and distinctive arrangement. The new set featured the absence of a traditional TitanTron, which had been part of the &quot;Raw&quot; staging since 1997. In its place was a curved LED banner with several rows of rectangle LED lights behind it. The new set also introduced LED floor panels on the entrance ramp along with LED ring posts. On the January 29, 2018 episode of Raw, new graphics and an updated logo were introduced, which lasted until September 23, 2019.

In September 2021, the ring-ropes changed color from red to white, which was also reflected on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On November 22 of that year, an updated version of the 2019 logo was introduced, alongside new graphics. The theme song was changed to &quot;Greatness&quot; by Vo Williams, which remained its theme song until November 20, 2023, when it was changed to &quot;Born to Be&quot; by def rebel, the artist behind WWE&#x27;s music input for its programming, which is performed by Supreme Madness. Bumper themes included &quot;Survival&quot;, &quot;Eye of an Warrior&quot; and &quot;Legacy&quot;.

In February 2022, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;NXT&quot; temporarily moved to Syfy in the United States due to USA Network broadcasting coverage of the 2022 Winter Olympics. A similar arrangement occurred in August 2024 for the 2024 Summer Olympics.

To differentiate the presentation from &quot;SmackDown&quot;, since January 6, 2025, &quot;Raw&quot; introduced a black mat featuring the logos of Netflix, Fortnite, Snickers, Cricket Wireless, Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Real American Beer, and Riyadh Season. The Fortnite logo was removed the following week. It also introduced a new announce table featuring sets of a LED lights with the WWE logo on a centre, which is a major change to the announce table design since the first brand extension of 2002.

=== Theme music ===

# A remixed version was released on August 18, 2014.
# Bold song titles are currently being used as the opening theme.

== Name-related lawsuits ==
The name for &quot;Raw&quot; was disputed in June 2009 when Muscle Flex Inc., a Los Angeles-based fitness company, had taken legal action against the WWE after a court ruled that some of WWE&#x27;s trademarks related to &quot;Raw&quot; were similar enough to the &quot;In the Raw&quot; trademark that they caused confusion among Canadians. On June 18, 2008, the Canadian Intellectual Property Office then issued a final decision that found certain wares listed in the trademark application from WWE (No. 1,153,018) were confusingly similar and thus lacked distinctiveness from the Muscle Flex trademark, which Muscle Flex is in the process of acquiring. The WWE appealed the CIPO&#x27;s ruling to the Federal Court of Canada, but failed to file the required documents by the deadline.

In August 2009, the court ruled in favor of Muscle Flex, Inc. that it was successful in defending its &quot;In the Raw&quot; trademark against the WWE. In a press release date issued on July 20, 2009, Muscle Flex Inc. disclosed that it was in possession of WWE &quot;Raw&quot;-labeled items that it believes directly infringe on its &quot;In the Raw&quot; trademark such as various CDs, VHS tapes, and a number of apparel items. According to the WWE&#x27;s most recent reported financial quarter in 2009, combined sales of WWE&#x27;s consumer products and digital media business segments produced $40 million in global revenues. In previous quarters, these numbers were even higher.

Similarly, in June 2017, the WWE issued a legal order to Raw Motors, an automobile repair company in Colwick, UK, over a logo that it claims infringes on one of its logos for &quot;Raw&quot; that was used from 2006 to 2012.

== Special episodes ==

Throughout its broadcast history, the show has aired episodes that have different themes. Some of them are yearly events such as the Slammy Awards. Others include tributes to various professional wrestlers who have recently died or retired from actively performing, as well as episodes commemorating various show milestones or anniversaries such as Raw 1000, which celebrated the 1000th broadcast. Raw also celebrated its thirtieth anniversary on RAW IS XXX on January 23, 2023.

==Roster==

The wrestlers featured on WWE take part in scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers are portrayed as heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match.

The primary commentators for &quot;Raw&quot; are Michael Cole and Pat McAfee. Additional commentary has been provided by Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler, Jonathan Coachman, Joey Styles, Tom Phillips, Kevin Patrick, Joe Tessitore and others since its creation.

== Broadcast ==
In the United States, the show airs live every Monday at 8 p.m. ET on Netflix. Occasionally, &quot;Raw&quot; is aired on same-day tape delay when WWE is on an overseas tour. &quot;Raw&quot; is also shown live on TNT Sports in the United Kingdom and Ireland, in a deal which began January 2020. &quot;Raw&quot; airs live in India at 5:30 a.m. on Tuesdays on Sony Ten 1.

Currently, Raw is broadcast live on ESPN 4 for Central America and on Fox Sports 2 in South America, in Mexico it is broadcast on Fox Sports, in Argentina on Fox Sports 3, in Chile on Fox Sports 1 and in Brazil on Fox Sports 2 and ESPN Extra, (also available on Star+ for Central and South America).

Syfy in the United States started airing a 2-hour replay of &quot;Raw&quot; on May 20, 2016. On June 26, 2018, WWE and USA Network announced a five-year contract extension for &quot;Raw&quot;. The new agreement for the live, weekly three-hour block commenced in October 2019. Clips from some WWE shows have also been shown on Fox Sports.com.

=== Online streaming ===
On September 24, 2012, Hulu signed a multi-year deal with WWE to stream all of the company&#x27;s TV shows and some of its web series which includes &quot;Raw&quot;. Episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; are available for viewing the following day as a condensed 90-minute version is available, not the full version as shown the previous night on USA Network.

As of December 9, 2016, all episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; are available on demand on the WWE Network. Recent episodes are available for on-demand viewing 30 days after their original air date.

After WrestleMania 32 in 2016, WWE began with airing the newest episodes of Raw and SmackDown on YouTube for countries that do not air WWE programming on traditional TV for free in less than 24 hours after the original broadcast (The links are blocked in countries where the shows are traditionally available). The 90-minute Hulu version gets put on YouTube for international audiences.

As of January 6, 2025, &quot;Raw&quot; is exclusively streaming on Netflix in most countries.

=== Canada ===
From 1995 to 2006, &quot;Raw&quot; was shown on The Sports Network (TSN) until it moved to rival sports broadcaster The Score (now renamed Sportsnet 360) after it was announced that TSN would be carrying &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; for the 2006 season. This meant that Canadian viewers would have to watch via tape-delay, as The Score did not broadcast &quot;Raw&quot; live at that time. Around that time, The Score aired &quot;Countdown to Raw&quot; until May 2013 when &quot;Raw&quot; is shown live to match the United States airtime. It was also shown on CKVR-TV in Barrie and CKMI-TV in Quebec until 2009.

During its run on TSN, which aired live, Raw occasionally had been censored live for extremely violent scenes, or when female wrestlers or characters were assaulted by male wrestlers (particularly one segment that featured the 3-Minute Warning assaulting Kitana Baker). These actions are supposed to be in order to meet Canadian broadcast standards, with repeat broadcasts often more heavily edited. This move had disappointed many wrestling fans over the years, and is unusual since the violence of wrestling scenes are not significantly different from other television programs aired on regular Canadian networks.

Due to Rogers holding the rights to the National Hockey League broadcasts, &quot;Raw&quot; also aired on its OLN channel (now Bravo). 

All archived broadcasts of &quot;Raw&quot; were available on the WWE Network until its closure in December 2024. Since January 1, 2025, WWE’s Canadian broadcast rights are held by Netflix. Select archived episodes are available for streaming on Netflix under the title &quot;Raw Vault,&quot; with live broadcasts beginning on January 6.

Previously the rights to broadcast Raw, along with other WWE shows, were held by free-to-air broadcaster e.tv. Raw would play on Sundays in the evening, with a 7-day delay, edited to one hour and was the most watched program on the channel. However, in 2017 e.tv decided not to renew its broadcasting deal with WWE. The rights were later resold to SuperSport (the initial broadcasters of WWE programming).

In 2019 SuperSport, along with its parent company MultiChoice, signed a deal to broadcast the 24-hour WWE channel as a pop-up channel for five months on their DStv platform. It is now a permanent channel on DStv under the channel number 128

<text>Murex is a genus of medium to large sized predatory tropical sea snails. These are carnivorous marine gastropod molluscs in the family Muricidae, commonly called &quot;murexes&quot; or &quot;rock snails&quot;.

The common name murex is still used for many species in the family Muricidae which were originally given the Latin generic name &quot;Murex,&quot; but have more recently been regrouped into newer genera. &quot;Murex&quot; was used in antiquity to describe spiny sea snails, especially those associated with the production of purple dye&quot;. Murex&quot; is one of the oldest classical seashell names still used by the scientific community.

Aristotle described these mollusks in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; using the Greek term πορφύρα (&quot;porphyra&quot;). 

== Etymology ==
The term murex originates from the Latin word &quot;mūrex,&quot; likely related to the Greek word μύαξ (&quot;myax&quot;), meaning sea mussel. The connection between these terms suggests a shared linguistic root, possibly linked to the Greek word μῦς (&quot;mys&quot;), meaning &quot;mouse,&quot; due to the perceived resemblance between the shape of certain mollusks and mice. 

==Fossil records==
This genus is known in the fossil records from the Cretaceous to the Quaternary (age range: from 125.45 to 0.0 million years ago). Fossils of species within this genus have been found all over the world. There are about 25 known extinct species.

==Distribution==
&quot;Murex&quot; is solely an Indo-Pacific genus, as demonstrated by Ponder &amp; Vokes (1988). The species from the western Atlantic that were formerly considered to belong to the genus &quot;Murex&quot; are now placed in the genus &quot;Haustellum&quot;.

==Habitat==
Most &quot;Murex&quot; species live in the intertidal or shallow subtidal zone, among rocks and corals.

==Shell description==
This genus includes many showy members, their elongate shells highly sculptured with spines or fronds. The inner surfaces of their ornate shells are often brightly colored.

==Human use==
Costly and labor-intensive dyes Tyrian purple (or &quot;royal purple&quot;) and tekhelet were historically made by the ancient Phoenicians, using mucus from the hypobranchial gland of two species commonly referred to as &quot;murex&quot;, &quot;Murex brandaris&quot; and &quot;Murex trunculus&quot;, which are the older names for &quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot; and &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;. This dye is a rare animal-produced organobromine compound, which the snails make using a specific bromide peroxidase enzyme that operates on dissolved bromide in sea water.
This dye was used in royal robes, other kinds of special ceremonial or ritual garments, or garments indicating high rank. It is hypothesised that the dye was the same dye as that which featured prominently in the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, the clothing of the High Priest of Israel officiating there; it is sometimes still used by Jews today in the ritual fringes (tzitzit) on four-cornered garments. A consensus has yet to be reached regarding the Biblical source of the &quot;blue&quot; dye, though the latest archeological research on dyes in this region indicates that it was indeed the Murex trunculus snail that was used for the famous tekhelet ancient dye.

== Species ==
The genus &quot;Murex&quot;, as originally defined by Linnaeus, encompassed many taxa that are now placed elsewhere in the superfamily Muricoidea. During the 19th century, the definition of &quot;Murex&quot; was restricted by Lamarck and his contemporaries first to species in the family Muricidae, and then was limited even further to the subfamilies Muricinae and Ocenebrinae. Malacologists of the 19th century including Kiener, Reeve, Küster &amp; Kobelt and Sowerby treated all muricoid forms as belonging to &quot;Murex&quot;. This is the main reason why &quot;Murex&quot; has so many synonyms.

The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) lists the following species with accepted names within the genus &quot;Murex&quot;. The subgenera are considered alternate representations.

* &quot;Murex acanthostephes&quot; 
* &quot;Murex aduncospinosus&quot; : 
* &quot;Murex africanus&quot; 
* &quot;Murex altispira&quot; Caltrop murex
* &quot;Murex antelmei&quot; 
* † &quot;Murex bonneti&quot; 
* &quot;Murex brevispina&quot; Short-spined murex
* † &quot;Murex camplytropis&quot;

<text>Beaux-Arts architecture ( , ) was the academic architectural style taught at the in Paris, particularly from the 1830s to the end of the 19th century. It drew upon the principles of French neoclassicism, but also incorporated Renaissance and Baroque elements, and used modern materials, such as iron and glass, and later, steel. It was an important style and enormous influence in Europe and the Americas through the end of the 19th century, and into the 20th, particularly for institutional and public buildings.

==History==
The Beaux-Arts style evolved from the French classicism of the Style Louis XIV, and then French neoclassicism beginning with Style Louis XV and Style Louis XVI. French architectural styles before the French Revolution were governed by Académie royale d&#x27;architecture (1671–1793), then, following the French Revolution, by the Architecture section of the . The academy held the competition for the Grand Prix de Rome in architecture, which offered prize winners a chance to study the classical architecture of antiquity in Rome.

The formal neoclassicism of the old regime was challenged by four teachers at the academy, Joseph-Louis Duc, Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste, and Léon Vaudoyer, who had studied at the French Academy in Rome at the end of the 1820s. They wanted to break away from the strict formality of the old style by introducing new models of architecture from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Their goal was to create an authentic French style based on French models. Their work was aided beginning in 1837 by the creation of the Commission of Historic Monuments, headed by the writer and historian Prosper Mérimée, and by the great interest in the Middle Ages caused by the publication in 1831 of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; by Victor Hugo.
Their declared intention was to &quot;imprint upon our architecture a truly national character.&quot;

The style referred to as &quot;Beaux-Arts&quot; in English reached the apex of its development during the Second Empire (1852–1870)
and the Third Republic that followed. The style of instruction that produced Beaux-Arts architecture continued without major interruption until 1968.

The Beaux-Arts style heavily influenced the architecture of the United States in the period from 1880 to 1920. In contrast, many European architects of the period 1860–1914 outside France gravitated away from Beaux-Arts and towards their own national academic centers. Owing to the cultural politics of the late 19th century, British architects of Imperial classicism followed a somewhat more independent course, a development culminating in Sir Edwin Lutyens&#x27;s New Delhi government buildings.

==Training==
The Beaux-Arts training emphasized the mainstream examples of Imperial Roman architecture between Augustus and the Severan emperors, Italian Renaissance, and French and Italian Baroque models especially, but the training could then be applied to a broader range of models: Quattrocento Florentine palace fronts or French late Gothic. American architects of the Beaux-Arts generation often returned to Greek models, which had a strong local history in the American Greek Revival of the early 19th century. For the first time, repertories of photographs supplemented meticulous scale drawings and on-site renderings of details.

Beaux-Arts training made great use of &quot;agrafes&quot;, clasps that link one architectural detail to another; to interpenetration of forms, a Baroque habit; to &quot;speaking architecture&quot; (&quot;architecture parlante&quot;) in which the appropriateness of symbolism was paid particularly close attention.

Beaux-Arts training emphasized the production of quick conceptual sketches, highly finished perspective presentation drawings, close attention to the program, and knowledgeable detailing. Site considerations included the social and urban context.

All architects-in-training passed through the obligatory stages—studying antique models, constructing , analyses reproducing Greek or Roman models, &quot;pocket&quot; studies and other conventional steps—in the long competition for the few desirable places at the Académie de France à Rome (housed in the Villa Medici) with traditional requirements of sending at intervals the presentation drawings called &quot;envois de Rome&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Beaux-Arts architecture depended on sculptural decoration along conservative modern lines, employing French and Italian Baroque and Rococo formulas combined with an impressionistic finish and realism. In the façade shown above, Diana grasps the cornice she sits on in a natural action typical of Beaux-Arts integration of sculpture with architecture.

Slightly overscaled details, bold sculptural supporting consoles, rich deep cornices, swags, and sculptural enrichments in the most bravura finish the client could afford gave employment to several generations of architectural modellers and carvers of Italian and Central European backgrounds. A sense of appropriate idiom at the craftsman level supported the design teams of the first truly modern architectural offices.

Characteristics of Beaux-Arts architecture included:

* Flat roof
* Rusticated and raised first story
* Hierarchy of spaces, from &quot;noble spaces&quot;—grand entrances and staircases—to utilitarian ones
* Arched windows
* Arched and pedimented doors
* Classical details: references to a synthesis of historicist styles and a tendency to eclecticism; fluency in a number of &quot;manners&quot;
* Symmetry
* Statuary, sculpture (bas-relief panels, figural sculptures, sculptural groups), murals, mosaics, and other artwork, all coordinated in theme to assert the identity of the building
* Classical architectural details: balustrades, pilasters, festoons, cartouches, acroteria, with a prominent display of richly detailed clasps (&quot;agrafes&quot;), brackets and supporting consoles
* Subtle polychromy

==Beaux-Arts architecture by country==

=== Europe ===

==== Belgium ====
Even though the style was not used as much as in neighbouring country France, some examples of Beaux-Arts buildings can still be found in Belgium. The most prominent of these examples is the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, but the complexes and triumphal arch of the Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark in Brussels and expansions of the Palace of Laeken in Brussels and Royal Galleries of Ostend also carry the Beaux-Arts style, created by the French architect Charles Girault. Furthermore, various large Beaux-Arts buildings can also be found in Brussels on the Avenue Molière/Molièrelaan. As an old student of the and as a designer of the Petit Palais, Girault was the figurehead of the Beaux-Arts around the 20th century. After the death of Alphonse Balat, he became the new and favourite architect of Leopold II of Belgium. Since Leopold was the grandson of Louis Philippe I of France, he loved this specific building style which is similar to and has its roots in the architecture that has been realized in the 17th and 18th century for the French crown.

==== France ====
The Beaux-Arts style in France in the 19th century was initiated by four young architects trained at the , architects; Joseph-Louis Duc, Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste, and Léon Vaudoyer, who had first studied Roman and Greek architecture at the Villa Medici in Rome, then in the 1820s began the systematic study of other historic architectural styles, including French architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They instituted teaching about a variety of architectural styles at the , and installed fragments of Renaissance and Medieval buildings in the courtyard of the school so students could draw and copy them. Each of them also designed new non-classical buildings in Paris inspired by a variety of different historic styles: Labrouste built the Sainte-Geneviève Library (1844–1850), Duc designed the new Palais de Justice and Court of Cassation on the Île-de-la-Cité (1852–1868), Vaudroyer designed the (1838–1867), and Duban designed the new buildings of the . Together, these buildings, drawing upon Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque and other non-classical styles, broke the monopoly of neoclassical architecture in Paris.

==== Germany ====
Germany is one of the countries where the Beaux-Arts style was well received, along with Baroque Revival architecture. The style was especially popular and most prominently featured in the now non-existent region of Prussia during the German Empire. The best example of Beaux-Arts buildings in Germany today are the Bode Museum in Berlin, and the Laeiszhalle and Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg in Hamburg.

==== Netherlands ====
Compared to other countries like France and Germany, the Beaux-Arts style never really became prominent in the Netherlands. However, a handful of significant buildings have nonetheless been made in this style during the period of 1880 to 1920, mainly being built in the cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam and The Hague.

==== Romania ====

In the Romanian Old Kingdom, towards the end of the century, many administrative buildings and private homes are built in the «Beaux-Arts» or «Eclectic» style, brought from France through French architects who came here for work in Romania, schooled in France. The National Bank of Romania Palace on Strada Lipscani, built between 1883 and 1885 is a good example of this style, decorated not just with columns (mainly Ionic), but also with allegorical statues placed in niches, that depict Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Justice. Because of the popularity of this style, it changed the way Bucharest looks, making it similar in some way with Paris, which led to Bucharest being seen as &quot;Little Paris&quot;. Eclecticism was very popular not just in Bucharest and Iași, the two biggest cities of Romania at that time, but also in smaller ones like Craiova, Caracal, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Pitești, Ploiești, Buzău, Botoșani, Piatra Neamț, etc. This style was used not only for administrative palaces and big houses of wealthy people, but also for middle-class homes.

====Mexico====
Beaux-Arts was architecturally relevant in Mexico in the late 19th century and the first decade of 20th century. The style was popular among the &quot;científicos&quot; of the Porfiriato. The Academy of San Carlos had an impact on the style&#x27;s development in Mexico. Notable architects include Genaro Alcorta, Alfred Giles, and Antonio Rivas Mercado (the preeminent Mexican architect during this era). Rivas Mercado served as the director of the Academy of San Carlos from 1903 to 1912. Having studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he aimed to incorporate and adapt its teachings to the Mexican context. Among the texts produced on the Beaux-Artes style, &quot;Eléments et théorie de l&#x27;architecture&quot; from Julien Guadet is said to have had the most influence in Mexico. The style lost popularity following the Mexican Revolution (beginning in 1910). In contemporary architecture, the style has influenced New Classical architect Jorge Loyzaga.

====United States====
Beaux-Arts architecture had a strong influence on architecture in the United States because of the many prominent American architects who studied at the , including Henry Hobson Richardson, John Galen Howard, Daniel Burnham, and Louis Sullivan.

The first American architect to attend the was Richard Morris Hunt, between 1846 and 1855, followed by Henry Hobson Richardson in 1860. They were followed by an entire generation. Richardson absorbed Beaux-Arts lessons in massing and spatial planning, then applied them to Romanesque architectural models that were not characteristic of the Beaux-Arts repertory. His Beaux-Arts training taught him to transcend slavish copying and recreate in the essential fully digested and idiomatic manner of his models. Richardson evolved a highly personal style (Richardsonian Romanesque) freed of historicism that was influential in early Modernism.

The &quot;White City&quot; of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago was a triumph of the movement and a major impetus for the short-lived City Beautiful movement in the United States. Beaux-Arts city planning, with its Baroque insistence on vistas punctuated by symmetry, eye-catching monuments, axial avenues, uniform cornice heights, a harmonious &quot;ensemble,&quot; and a somewhat theatrical nobility and accessible charm, embraced ideals that the ensuing Modernist movement decried or just dismissed. The first American university to institute a Beaux-Arts curriculum is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1893, when the French architect Constant-Désiré Despradelle was brought to MIT to teach. The Beaux-Arts curriculum was subsequently begun at Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. From 1916, the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York City schooled architects, painters, and sculptors to work as active collaborators.

===== Beaux-Arts buildings in the United States =====

Numerous American university campuses were designed in the Beaux-Arts, notably: Columbia University (commissioned in 1896), designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White; the University of California, Berkeley (commissioned in 1898), designed by John Galen Howard; the United States Naval Academy (built 1901–1908), designed by Ernest Flagg; the campus of MIT (commissioned in 1913), designed by William W. Bosworth; Emory University and Carnegie Mellon University (commissioned in 1908 and 1904, respectively), both designed by Henry Hornbostel; and the University of Texas (commissioned in 1931), designed by Paul Philippe Cret.

While the style of Beaux-Art buildings was adapted from historical models, the construction used the most modern available technology. The Grand Palais in Paris (1897–1900) had a modern iron frame inside; the classical columns were purely for decoration. The 1914–1916 construction of the Carolands Chateau south of San Francisco was built to withstand earthquakes, following the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The noted Spanish structural engineer Rafael Guastavino (1842–1908), famous for his vaultings, known as Guastavino tile work, designed vaults in dozens of Beaux-Arts buildings in Boston, New York, and elsewhere.

Beaux-Arts architecture also brought a civic face to railroads. Chicago&#x27;s Union Station, Detroit&#x27;s Michigan Central Station, Jacksonville&#x27;s Union Terminal, Grand Central Terminal and the original Pennsylvania Station in New York, and Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Union Station are famous American examples of this style. Cincinnati has a number of notable Beaux-Arts style buildings, including the Hamilton County Memorial Building in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, and the former East End Carnegie library in the Columbia-Tusculum neighborhood.

Two notable ecclesiastical variants on the Beaux-Arts style—both serving the same archdiocese, and both designed by the same architect—stand in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota. Minneapolis&#x27; Basilica of St. Mary, the first basilica constructed and consecrated in the United States, was designed by Franco-American architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray (1861–1917) and opened in 1914. A year later in neighboring Saint Paul, construction of the massive Masqueray-designed Cathedral of Saint Paul (also known as National Shrine Cathedral of the Apostle Paul) was completed. The third-largest Roman Catholic cathedral in the United States, its architecture predominantly reflects Beaux-Arts principles, into which Masqueray integrated stylistic elements of other celebrated French churches.

Other examples include the main branch of the New York Public Library; Bancroft Hall at the Naval Academy, the largest academic dormitory in the world; and Michigan Central Station in Detroit, the tallest railway station in the world at the time of completion.

===== Beaux-Arts architects in the United States =====
In the late 1800s, during the years when Beaux-Arts architecture was at a peak in France, Americans were one of the largest groups of foreigners in Paris.

<text>Influenza A virus (Alphainfluenzavirus influenzae) or IAV is the only species of the genus &quot;Alphainfluenzavirus&quot; of the virus family &quot;Orthomyxoviridae&quot;. It is a pathogen with strains that infect birds and some mammals, as well as causing seasonal flu in humans. Mammals in which different strains of IAV circulate with sustained transmission are bats, pigs, horses and dogs; other mammals can occasionally become infected.
IAV is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus, with a segmented genome. Through a combination of mutation and genetic reassortment the virus can evolve to acquire new characteristics, enabling it to evade host immunity and occasionally to jump from one species of host to another.

Subtypes of IAV are defined by the combination of the antigenic H and N proteins in the viral envelope; for example, &quot;H1N1&quot; designates an IAV subtype that has a type-1 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type-1 neuraminidase (N) protein. Almost all possible combinations of H (1 through 16) and N (1 through 11) have been isolated from wild birds. Further variations exist within the subtypes and can lead to very significant differences in the virus&#x27;s ability to infect and cause disease, as well as to the severity of symptoms.
Symptoms of human seasonal flu usually include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, conjunctivitis and, in severe cases, breathing problems and pneumonia that may be fatal. Humans can rarely become infected with strains of avian or swine influenza, usually as a result of close contact with infected animals; symptoms range from mild to severe including death. Bird-adapted strains of the virus can be asymptomatic in some aquatic birds but lethal if they spread to other species, such as chickens.
IAV disease in poultry can be prevented by vaccination; however, biosecurity control measures are preferred. In humans, seasonal influenza can be treated in its early stages with antiviral medicines. A global network, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors the spread of influenza with the aim to inform development of both seasonal and pandemic vaccines. Several millions of specimens are tested by the GISRS network annually through a network of laboratories in 127 countries. As well as human viruses, GISRS monitors avian, swine, and other potentially zoonotic influenza viruses. IAV vaccines need to be reformulated regularly in order to keep up with changes in the virus.

== Virology ==

=== Classification ===
There are two methods of classification, one based on surface proteins (originally serotypes), and the other based on its behavior, mainly the host animal.

=== Subtypes ===
There are two antigenic proteins on the surface of the viral envelope, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Different influenza virus genomes encode different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. Based on their serotype, there are 18 known types of hemagglutinin and 11 types of neuraminidase. Subtypes of IAV are classified by their combination of H and N proteins. For example, &quot;H5N1&quot; designates an influenza A subtype that has a type-5 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type-1 neuraminidase (N) protein. Additionally, further variation exists within viral subtypes which may lead to significant differences in behavior.

By definition, the subtyping scheme only takes into account the two outer proteins, not the at least eight proteins internal to the virus. Almost all possible combinations of H (1 through 16) and N (1 through 11) have been isolated from wild birds. H17 and H18 have only been discovered in bats.

=== Influenza virus nomenclature ===
Due to the high variability of the virus, subtyping is not sufficient to uniquely identify a strain of influenza A virus. To unambiguously describe a specific isolate of virus, researchers use the &quot;Influenza virus nomenclature,&quot; which describes, among other things, the subtype, year, and place of collection. Some examples include:
** The starting indicates that the virus is an influenza A virus.
** indicates the place of collection. is a laboratory sequence number. (or just ) indicates that the sample was collected in 2021. No species is mentioned so by default, the sample was collected from a human.
** indicates the subtype of the virus.
** This example shows an additional field before the place: . It indicates that the sample was collected from a pig.
** This example carries an unusual designation in the last part: instead of a usual , it uses . This was in order to distinguish the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus lineage from older H1N1 viruses.

=== Structure and genetics ===
==== Structure ====
The influenza A virus has a negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA genome, enclosed in a lipid envelope. The virus particle (also called the &quot;virion&quot;) is 80–120 nanometers in diameter, such that the smallest virions adopt an elliptical shape; larger virions have a filamentous shape.

Core – The central core of the virion contains the viral RNA genome, which is made of eight separate segments. The nucleoprotein (NP) coats the viral RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein that assumes a helical (spiral) configuration. Three large proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA), which are responsible for RNA transcription and replication, are bound to each segment of viral RNP.

Capsid – The matrix protein M1 forms a layer between the nucleoprotein and the envelope, called the capsid.

Envelope – The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell. Two viral proteins; hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are inserted into the envelope and are exposed as spikes on the surface of the virion. Both proteins are antigenic; a host&#x27;s immune system can react to them and produce antibodies in response. The M2 protein forms an ion channel in the envelope and is responsible for uncoating the virion once it has bound to a host cell.

==== Genome ====
The table below presents a concise summary of the influenza genome and the principal functions of the proteins which are encoded. Segments are conventionally numbered from 1 to 8 in descending order of length.
Three viral proteins - PB1, PB2, and PA – associate to form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which functions to transcribe and replicate the viral RNA.

Viral messenger RNA transcription – The RdRp complex transcribes viral mRNAs by using a mechanism called cap-snatching. It consists in the hijacking and cleavage of host capped pre-mRNAs. Host cell mRNA is cleaved near the cap to yield a primer for the transcription of positive-sense viral mRNA using the negative-sense viral RNA as a template. The host cell then transports the viral mRNA into the cytoplasm where ribosomes manufacture the viral proteins.

Replication of the viral RNA – The replication of the influenza virus, unlike most other RNA viruses, takes place in the nucleus and involves two steps. The RdRp first of all transcribes the negative-sense viral genome into a positive-sense complimentary RNA (cRNA), then the cRNAs are used as templates to transcribe new negative-sense vRNA copies. These are exported from the nucleus and assemble near the cell membrane to form the core of new virions.

== Epidemiology ==

===Evolution and history===
The predominant natural reservoir of influenza viruses is thought to be wild waterfowl. The subtypes of influenza A virus are estimated to have diverged 2,000 years ago. Influenza viruses A and B are estimated to have diverged from a single ancestor around 4,000 years ago, while the ancestor of influenza viruses A and B and the ancestor of influenza virus C are estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor around 8,000 years ago.

Outbreaks of influenza-like disease can be found throughout recorded history. The first probable record is by Hippocrates in 412 BCE. The historian Fujikawa listed 46 epidemics of flu-like illness in Japan between 862 and 1868. In Europe and the Americas, a number of epidemics were recorded through the Middle Ages and up to the end of the 19th century.In 1918-1919 came the first flu pandemic of the 20th century, known generally as the &quot;Spanish flu&quot;, which caused an estimated 20 to 50 million deaths worldwide. It is now known that this was caused by an immunologically novel H1N1 subtype of influenza A. The next pandemic took place in 1957, the &quot;Asian flu&quot;, which was caused by a H2N2 subtype of the virus in which the genome segments coding for HA and NA appeared to have derived from avian influenza strains by reassortment, while the remainder of the genome was descended from the 1918 virus. The 1968 pandemic (&quot;Hong Kong flu&quot;) was caused by a H3N2 subtype in which the NA segment was derived from the 1957 virus, while the HA segment had been reassorted from an avian strain of influenza.

In the 21st century, a strain of H1N1 flu (since titled &quot;H1N1pdm09&quot;) was antigenically very different from previous H1N1 strains, leading to a pandemic in 2009. Because of its close resemblance to some strains circulating in pigs, this became known as &quot;swine flu&quot;.

Influenza A virus continues to circulate and evolve in birds and pigs. Almost all possible combinations of H (1 through 16) and N (1 through 11) have been isolated from wild birds. As of June 2024, two particularly virulent IAV strains - H5N1 and H7N9 – are predominant in wild bird populations. These frequently cause outbreaks in domestic poultry, with occasional spillover infections in humans who are in close contact with poultry.

=== Pandemic potential ===
Influenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of RNA viruses. The segmentation of the influenza A virus genome facilitates genetic recombination by segment reassortment in hosts who become infected with two different strains of influenza viruses at the same time. With reassortment between strains, an avian strain which does not affect humans may acquire characteristics from a different strain which enable it to infect and pass between humans – a zoonotic event. It is thought that all influenza A viruses causing outbreaks or pandemics among humans since the 1900s originated from strains circulating in wild aquatic birds through reassortment with other influenza strains. It is possible (though not certain) that pigs may act as an intermediate host for reassortment.

=== Surveillance ===
The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) is a global network of laboratories that monitor the spread of influenza with the aim to provide the World Health Organization with influenza control information and to inform vaccine development. Several millions of specimens are tested by the GISRS network annually through a network of laboratories in 127 countries. As well as human viruses, GISRS also monitors avian, swine, and other potentially zoonotic influenza viruses.

=== Seasonal flu ===

Flu season is an annually recurring time period characterized by the prevalence of an outbreak of influenza, caused either by Influenza A or by Influenza B. The season occurs during the cold half of the year in temperate regions; November through February in the northern hemisphere and May to October in the southern hemisphere. Flu seasons also exist in the tropics and subtropics, with variability from region to region. Annually, about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths from seasonal flu occur worldwide.

There are several possible reasons for the winter peak in temperate regions:
* During the winter, people spend more time indoors with the windows sealed, so they are more likely to breathe the same air as someone who has the flu and thus contract the virus.
* Days are shorter during the winter, and lack of sunlight leads to low levels of vitamin D and melatonin, both of which require sunlight for their generation. This compromises our immune systems, which in turn decreases ability to fight the virus.
* The influenza virus may survive better in colder, drier climates, and therefore be able to infect more people.
* Cold air reduces the ability of the nasal membranes to resist infection.

=== Zoonotic infections ===
A zoonosis a disease in a human caused by a pathogen (such as a bacterium, or virus) that has jumped from a non-human to a human. Avian and pig influenza viruses can, on rare occasions, transmit to humans and cause zoonotic influenza virus infections; these infections are usually confined to people who have been in close contact with infected animals or material such as infected feces and meat, they do not spread to other humans. Symptoms of these infections in humans vary greatly; some are in asymptomatic or mild while others can cause severe disease, leading to severe pneumonia and death. A wide range of Influenza A virus subtypes have been found to cause zoonotic disease.

Zoonotic infections can be prevented by good hygiene, by preventing farmed animals from coming into contact with wild animals, and by using appropriate personal protective equipment.

As of June 2024, there is concern about two subtypes of avian influenza which are circulating in wild bird populations worldwide, H5N1 and H7N9. Both of these have potential to devastate poultry stocks, and both have jumped to humans with relatively high case fatality rates. H5N1 in particular has infected a wide range of mammals and may be adapting to mammalian hosts.

== Prevention and treatment ==

=== Vaccine ===

As of June 2024, the influenza viruses which circulate widely in humans are IAV subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, together with Influenza B. Annual vaccination is the primary and most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications, especially for high-risk groups. Vaccines against the flu are trivalent or quadrivalent, providing protection against the dominant strains of IAV(H1N1) and IAV(H3N2), and one or two influenza B virus strains; the formulation is continually reviewed in order to match the predominant strains in circulation.

It is possible to vaccinate poultry and pigs against specific strains of influenza. Vaccination should be combined with other control measures such as infection monitoring, early detection and biosecurity.

=== Treatment ===

The main treatment for mild influenza is supportive; rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medicines to alleviate symptoms while the body&#x27;s own immune system works to recover from infection. Antiviral drugs are recommended for those with severe symptoms, or for those who are at risk of developing complications such as pneumonia.

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Humans ===
The symptoms of seasonal flu are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose. The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific: a sudden fever; muscle aches; cough; fatigue; sore throat; headache; difficulty sleeping; loss of appetite; diarrhoea or abdominal pain; nausea and vomiting.

Humans can rarely become infected with strains of avian or swine influenza, usually as a result of close contact with infected animals or contaminated material; symptoms generally resemble seasonal flu but occasionally can be severe, including death.

=== Other animals ===

==== Birds ====
Some species of wild aquatic birds act as natural asymptomatic carriers of a large variety of influenza A viruses, which they can spread over large distances in their annual migration. Symptoms of avian influenza vary according to both the strain of virus underlying the infection, and on the species of bird affected. Symptoms of influenza in birds may include swollen head, watery eyes, unresponsiveness, lack of coordination, respiratory distress such as sneezing or gurgling.

===== Highly pathogenic avian influenza =====
Because of the impact of avian influenza on economically important chicken farms, avian virus strains are classified as either highly pathogenic (and therefore potentially requiring vigorous control measures) or low pathogenic. The test for this is based solely on the effect on chickens - a virus strain is highly pathogenic avian influenza if 75% or more of chickens die after being deliberately infected with it, or if it is genetically similar to such a strain. The alternative classification is low pathogenic avian influenza. Classification of a virus strain as either a low or high pathogenic strain is based on the severity of symptoms in domestic chickens and does not predict severity of symptoms in other species. Chickens infected with low pathogenic avian influenza display mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, whereas highly pathogenic avian influenza causes serious breathing difficulties, significant drop in egg production, and sudden death.

Since 2006, the World Organization for Animal Health requires all detections of low pathogenic avian influenza H5 and H7 subtypes to be reported because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains.

==== Pigs ====

Signs of swine flu in pigs can include fever, depression, coughing (barking), discharge from the nose or eyes, sneezing, breathing difficulties, eye redness or inflammation, and going off feed. Some pigs infected with influenza, however, may show no signs of illness at all. Swine flu subtypes are principally H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2; it is spread either through close contact between animals or by the movement of contaminated equipment between farms. Humans who are in close contact with pigs can sometimes become infected.

==== Horses ====

Equine influenza can affect horses, donkeys, and mules; it has a very high rate of transmission among horses, and a relatively short incubation time of one to three days. Clinical signs of equine influenza include fever, nasal discharge, have a dry, hacking cough, depression, loss of appetite and weakness. EI is caused by two subtypes of influenza A viruses: H7N7 and H3N8, which have evolved from avian influenza A viruses.

==== Dogs ====

Most animals infected with canine influenza A will show symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, fever, lethargy, eye discharge, and a reduced appetite lasting anywhere from 2–3 weeks. There are two different influenza A dog flu viruses: one is an H3N8 virus and the other is an H3N2 virus. The H3N8 strain has evolved from an equine influenza avian virus which has adapted to sustained transmission among dogs. The H3N2 strain is derived from an avian influenza which jumped to dogs in 2004 in either Korea or China. It is likely that the virus persists in both animal shelters and kennels, as well as in farms where dogs are raised for meat production.

==== Bats ====

The first bat flu virus, IAV(H17N10), was first discovered in 2009 in little yellow-shouldered bats (&quot;Sturnira lilium&quot;) in Guatemala. In 2012 a second bat influenza A virus IAV(H18N11) was discovered in flat-faced fruit-eating bats (&quot;Artibeus planirostris&quot;) from Peru. Bat influenza viruses have been found to be poorly adapted to non-bat species.

== Research ==
Influenza research includes efforts to understand how influenza viruses enter hosts, the relationship between influenza viruses and bacteria, how influenza symptoms progress, and why some influenza viruses are deadlier than others. Past pandemics, and especially the 1918 pandemic, are the subject of much research to understand and prevent flu pandemics.

The World Health Organization has published a Research Agenda with five streams:
* Stream 1. Reducing the risk of emergence of pandemic influenza. This stream is entirely focused on preventing and limiting pandemic influenza; this includes research into what characteristics make a strain either mild or deadly, worldwide surveillance of influenza A viruses with pandemic potential, and the prevention and management of potentially zoonotic influenza in domestic and farmed animals.
* Stream 2. Limiting the spread of pandemic, zoonotic and seasonal epidemic influenza. This is more broadly targeted at both pandemic and seasonal influenza, looking at the transmission of the virus between people and the ways in which it can spread globally, as well as the environmental and social factors which affect transmission.
* Stream 3. Minimizing the impact of pandemic, zoonotic, and seasonal epidemic influenza. This is principally concerned with vaccination – improving the effectiveness of vaccines, vaccine technology, as well as the speed with which an effective vaccine can be developed and ways in which vaccines can be manufactured and delivered worldwide.
* Stream 4. Optimizing the treatment of patients. This stream aims to reduce the impact of influenza by looking at methods of treatment, vulnerable groups, genetic predispositions, the interaction of influenza infection with other diseases, and influenza sequelae.
* Stream 5. Promoting the development and application of modern public health tools. Aiming to improve the ways in which public policy can combat influenza; this includes the introduction of new technologies, epidemic and pandemic modelling, and the communication of accurate and trustworthy information to the public.

<text>Bernardo Atxaga (born 27 July 1951), pseudonym of Joseba Irazu Garmendia, is a Spanish Basque writer and self-translator.

He is a full member of the Royal Academy of the Basque Language since 2006, in November 2010, he was also named a member of Jakiunde, Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters.

==Biography==
Atxaga was born in Asteasu, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain in 1951. He received a diploma in economics from the university of Bilbao, and studied philosophy at the university of Barcelona. He worked as an economist, bookseller, professor of the Basque language, publisher, and radio scriptwriter until 1980, when he dedicated himself completely to writing.

His first text was published in 1972, in an anthology of Basque authors. His first short story, &quot;Ziutateaz&quot; (&quot;About The City&quot;), was published in 1976. His first collection of poetry, &quot;Etiopia&quot; (&quot;Ethiopia&quot;), appeared in 1978. He has written plays, song lyrics, novels and short stories. His book of short stories, &quot;Obabakoak&quot; (&quot;Individuals and things of Obaba&quot;), published in 1988, won him much fame and several prizes, such as Spain&#x27;s National Literature Prize. So far, the book has been translated into more than 20 languages.

Atxaga generally writes in the Basque language, Euskara, but translates his works into Spanish as well. Following the example of &quot;Obabakoak&quot;, several of his other works have been translated into other languages.

<text>USS &quot;Sculpin&quot; (SS-191), a &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sculpin.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sculpin&quot;′s keel was laid down on 7 September 1937 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 July 1938, sponsored by Mrs. Bernice F. Defrees, wife of Rear Admiral Joseph R. Defrees, Sr, Chief of Staff to the Commander, Scouting Force, United States Fleet; their son would later lose his life aboard &quot;Sculpin&quot;. &quot;Sculpin&quot; was commissioned on 16 January 1939, Lieutenant Warren D. Wilkin in command.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
While on her initial shakedown cruise on 23 May 1939, &quot;Sculpin&quot; was diverted to search for , which had gone missing during a test dive. Sighting a red smoke bomb and a rescue buoy from &quot;Squalus&quot;, she established communications, first by underwater telephone and then by signals tapped in Morse code on the hull. &quot;Sculpin&quot; stood by while rescued the survivors, and rendered further assistance by familiarizing the divers with the configuration of her sister ship. &quot;Sculpin&quot; aided in the salvage of the sunken vessel by sounding out the approaches to Portsmouth, New Hampshire and preparing supplementary charts of the area where &quot;Squalus&quot; was refloated.

Following the assistance given in the recovery of &quot;Squalus&quot;, &quot;Sculpin&quot; engaged in type training off the Atlantic coast until transferred to the Pacific Fleet. Departing Portsmouth on 28 January 1940, she arrived at San Diego, California on 6 March. She sailed west on 1 April, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 9 March, where she was based for the next 18 months. Departing Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1941 as part of Submarine Division 22, she arrived at Manila on 8 November. From Cavite, she engaged in local operations and type training until war broke out.

===First war patrol===
Departing Cavite on the night of 8–9 December 1941, &quot;Sculpin&quot; – commanded by Lucius H. Chappell – escorted and as far as San Bernardino Strait. She then took station off Lamon Bay in the Philippine Sea north of Luzon on 10 December. &quot;The weather was foul, the visibility abysmal.&quot; When Frederick W. Warder&#x27;s &quot;Seawolf&quot; was moved, &quot;Sculpin&quot; took up her station off Aparri, departing 21 December. Three days later, a Japanese task force came ashore at the unguarded Lamon Bay. Off Aparri, &quot;Sculpin&quot; detected a target, but was unable to gain firing position. After was twice &quot;pooped&quot; by heavy seas, &quot;Sculpin&quot; requested she be moved back to Lamon Bay, where she found weather so bad, she proved unable to attack Japanese shipping going in or out. Her first patrol terminated (after a duration of 45 days) at Surabaya, Java, on 22 January.

===Second war patrol===
Her second patrol, from 30 January-28 February, was in the Molucca Sea, east of Sulawesi. On 4 February off Kendari, Java, she fired three torpedoes at a Japanese destroyer. Two hits inflicted heavy damage. After the war, Japanese records revealed had beached herself, and was later salvaged. Three nights later, &quot;Sculpin&quot; detected a Japanese task force (bound for Makassar City, Celebes) made up of destroyers, cruisers, and an aircraft carrier (a startling sight, as it remained for the duration). She fired on a cruiser, missed and was detected and forced to dive. She escaped four hours later after a heavy depth charge attack by six destroyers. When she got loose, she radioed a contact report, which was not received. On the night of 17 February, she was detected while making a surface attack, firing two torpedoes each at a freighter and a destroyer, all of which missed, and she was forced to dive. During the ensuing depth charge attack, she sustained damage to her starboard main controller and starboard shaft. On 28 February, after 28 days at sea, she arrived at Fremantle for refit, falling under the command of Admiral Charles A. Lockwood.

===Third war patrol===
Her third patrol, from 13 March-27 April out of Fremantle, was in the Banda Sea, again off Kendari. Codebreakers got word a Japanese carrier force, Carrier Division Five, had arrived on 24 March. Two days later, this force departed Kendari; &quot;Sculpin&quot; failed to spot them, but did fire three torpedoes at a freighter, all of which missed. The torpedoes were last seen running straight for the target, but apparently ran deeper than set. A similar incident occurred on 1 April in a night attack, and within a week, a third attack with three more torpedoes had also failed. &quot;Sculpin&quot;, like many of her sister submarines in the early days of the Pacific War, was plagued by malfunctions of the Mark 14 torpedo, which ran erratically or too deep, or of the Mark VI exploder, which failed to detonate them correctly. The frustrated &quot;Sculpin&quot; returned to Fremantle on 27 April, after forty-five unproductive days on patrol.

===Fourth war patrol===
&quot;Sculpin&quot;″s fourth war patrol, from 29 May – 17 June, was in the South China Sea. On 8 June, she was unsuccessful in an attack on a cargo ship, again due to torpedo malfunction. A vigorous depth charge attack kept &quot;Sculpin&quot; down while the cargo ship escaped. On 13 June, near Balabac Strait, she torpedoed a cargo ship which returned fire with her deck gun and commenced to limp away. Turning on two accompanying tankers astern of the cargo ship, &quot;Sculpin&quot; made an attack but was forced to dive to prevent being rammed by one of the tankers. Surfacing at dusk, &quot;Sculpin&quot; pursued the cargo ship, but was again driven away by accurate gunfire from the maru. She shifted her attack to a tanker, leaving the ship listing and making heavy smoke. However, no sinking was confirmed. Off Cape Varella, Indochina, early on the morning of 19 June, she torpedoed a cargo ship, making a hit forward of the stack. A heavy secondary explosion was heard, and the damaged vessel was last seen headed for the shore to beach, smoke pouring from her forward hatch. &quot;Sculpin&quot; returned to Australia on 17 July. She moved to Brisbane, under Ralph Waldo Christie (part of Admiral Arthur S. Carpender&#x27;s 7th Fleet, and ultimately General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s South West Pacific Area command), along with the rest of Submarine Squadron Two (SubRon 2), in August.

===Fifth war patrol===
The waters of the Bismarck Archipelago were the theater of her fifth patrol, from 8 September-26 October. After reconnaissance off Thilenius and Montagu harbors of New Ireland, &quot;Sculpin&quot; commenced her search for Japanese shipping. On 28 September, she scored two hits on a cargo ship, but was forced to dive as a Japanese destroyer raced to the scene. &quot;Sculpin&quot; was under depth charge attack for three hours, during which she sustained minor damage. On 7 October, she made her first confirmed kill, &quot;Naminoue Maru&quot;, off New Ireland. Escaping the Japanese escorts&#x27; countermeasures, she remained in the general area where, a week later, she intercepted a three-ship convoy in the shipping lane between Rabaul and Kavieng. Waiting until the escorting destroyer had made a patrol sweep to the opposite side of the convoy, &quot;Sculpin&quot; fired a spread of four torpedoes at &quot;Sumoyoshi Maru&quot;. While the blazing ship lay dead in the water and sinking, &quot;Sculpin&quot; slipped away. Four days later, she inflicted minor damage on , with a hit forward of the bridge, but was driven off by the cruiser&#x27;s gunfire. For the 54-day duration of her patrol, she was credited with three ships for 24,100 tons; postwar, only two for 6,652 tons were confirmed.

===Sixth war patrol===
Departing Brisbane on her sixth war patrol, from 18 November 1942 – 8 January 1943, &quot;Sculpin&quot; worked her way past New Britain to the rich hunting grounds off Truk. After escaping a Japanese aerial attack on 11 December, she was put on the scent of a Japanese aircraft carrier by codebreakers. On the night of 17–18 December, she closed to . One illuminated &quot;Sculpin&quot; with a searchlight as both commenced heavy fire with deck guns. The submarine went deep as the enemy depth charge attack and prolonged sonar search continued. The following night, she scored two hits on a tanker, with no sinking credited, and none confirmed postwar. For her 52-day patrol, &quot;Sculpin&quot; had nothing to show.

===Refurbishment and seventh war patrol===
&quot;Sculpin&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1943, and sailed east to San Francisco, California, spending three months in overhaul at Mare Island. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 9 May, she departed Hawaii for her seventh war patrol on 24 May and operated off the northwest coast of Honshū. Around midnight on 9 June, three days after arriving on station off Sofu Gan (also called Lot&#x27;s Wife), she detected a Japanese task force consisting of two aircraft carriers with a cruiser escort. &quot;Sculpin&quot; rang up flank speed to close, but was outdistanced. She made a desperate shot, four torpedoes from 7,000 yd (6,400 m); one exploded prematurely, giving her away, and she was unable to make a stern tube shot. Two heavy underwater explosions were heard as the submarine submerged. On 14 June, she damaged a cargo ship but was forced to dive and run silent to avoid the vigorous countermeasures of the &quot;maru&quot;″s escorts. On 19 June, she destroyed two sampans by gunfire, leaving them aflame, with decks awash. During the remainder of the patrol, she spotted other possible targets, but they all hugged the shore some running inside the 10 fathom (18 m) line. The patrol terminated at Midway Island on 4 July after 41 days; she was credited with no damage.

===Eighth war patrol===
&quot;Sculpin&quot;″s eighth war patrol, from 25 July–17 September, was off the Chinese coast, in the East China Sea and Formosa Strait. On 9 August, she torpedoed and sank &quot;Sekko Maru&quot; off the coast of Formosa. She evaded ASW patrol craft in the Taiwan Strait on 16–17 August. On 21 August, she intercepted an armed cargo ship and fired a spread of three torpedoes which ran &quot;hot, straight, and normal&quot; but did not explode. &quot;Sculpin&quot; was immediately pounced upon by escorting destroyers and was forced to dive. The cargo ship escaped in the ensuing depth charge attack. A similar torpedo malfunction occurred on 1 September, when the splash of water resulting from the torpedo striking the target&#x27;s hull could be seen, but no detonation occurred. The submarine escaped the immediate counterattack of the escorts, and after reconnaissance of Marcus Island, she returned to Midway Atoll after 54 days on patrol, earning credit for one ship of 4,500 tons (reduced to 3,183 tons postwar).

===Ninth war patrol and loss===
Following a brief overhaul period at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Sculpin&quot; – commanded by Fred Connaway – departed Hawaii on 5 November 1943. Ordered to patrol north of Truk, she was to intercept and attack Japanese forces leaving Truk to oppose the forthcoming invasion of Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands. &quot;Sculpin&quot; and two other submarines were to form a wolf pack to make coordinated attacks on the enemy, with either or . Captain John P. Cromwell, who had been fully briefed on the Tarawa operation and was in the picture on , was on board &quot;Sculpin&quot; to coordinate wolf pack operations.

After refueling at Johnston Island on 7 November, &quot;Sculpin&quot; proceeded to her assigned station. On 29 November, Captain Cromwell was ordered to activate the wolf pack. When the submarine failed to acknowledge, the message was repeated 48 hours later. The submarine was presumed lost on 30 December and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 March 1944.

The account of &quot;Sculpin&quot;″s final patrol was given by the surviving members of her crew, who were liberated from Japanese prisoner of war camps after V-J Day. On 16 November, she had arrived on station and had made radar contact with a large, high-speed convoy on the night of 18 November. Making a fast end run on the surface to attack on the morning of 19 November, she was in firing position but was forced to dive when the convoy and its escorts zigged toward her. When the Japanese task force changed course, &quot;Sculpin&quot; surfaced to make another run, but was discovered by , which the convoy commander had left behind for just this eventuality, only away. Diving fast, the submarine escaped the first salvo of depth charges. A second string of &quot;ash cans&quot; knocked out her depth gauge and caused other minor damage. She evaded the destroyer in a rain squall and around 1200 attempted to come to periscope depth. The damaged depth gauge stuck at , so the submarine broached and was again detected. She immediately submerged and the destroyer attacked with a pattern of 18 depth charges. There was considerable damage, including temporary loss of depth control. As a result, &quot;Sculpin&quot; ran beyond safe depth so that many leaks developed in the hull. So much water entered that the submarine was forced to run at high speed to maintain depth. This made tracking easy for the Japanese sonar. A second depth charge attack knocked out &quot;Sculpin&quot;″s sonar.

The submarine&#x27;s commanding officer, Commander Fred Connaway, decided to surface and give the crew of the doomed vessel a chance for survival. With her decks still awash, &quot;Sculpin&quot;″s gunners manned the deck guns but were no match for the destroyer&#x27;s main battery. A shell hit the conning tower and killed the bridge watch, including Connaway, and flying fragments killed the gun crew, including gunnery officer Lieutenant Joseph Defrees, the ship&#x27;s sponsor&#x27;s son. The ship&#x27;s senior surviving officer, Lieutenant George E. Brown, ordered &quot;Sculpin&quot; abandoned and scuttled. Before he opened the vents, he informed Captain Cromwell. Fearing he might reveal the plans for the Tarawa invasion under the influence of torture or drugs, Cromwell refused to leave the stricken submarine, giving his life to escape capture. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his act of heroism and devotion to country. &quot;Sculpin&quot;″s diving officer, Ensign W. M. Fiedler (who failed to notice the depth gauge had stuck), along with ten others, some doubtless already dead, joined him.

Forty-two of &quot;Sculpin&quot;″s crew were picked up by &quot;Yamagumo&quot;. One badly wounded sailor (William Henry Welsh) was thrown back in the sea because of his condition. The survivors were questioned for about ten days at the Japanese naval base at Truk, then were embarked on two aircraft carriers returning to Japan. carried 21 of the survivors in her hold. On 4 December, the carrier was torpedoed and sunk by and twenty of the American prisoners perished; one man, George Rocek, was saved when he was able to grab hold of a ladder on the side of a passing Japanese destroyer and hauled himself on board. (Ironically, &quot;Sailfish&quot; – at the time named &quot;Squalus&quot; – was the same submarine &quot;Sculpin&quot; had helped to locate and raise some four-and-a-half years before.) The other 21 survivors arrived at Ōfuna Camp, Japan, on 5 December and, after further questioning, were sent to the Ashio copper mines for the duration of the war.

==Awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with eight battle stars for World War II service
* Philippine Presidential Unit Citation (Republic of the Philippines)

&quot;Sculpin&quot; ended World War II with a total of three confirmed ships sunk for 9,835 tons.

==In media==
&quot;Sculpin&quot; is the subject of an episode of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, which aired during the 1957–1958 season.

<doc id="440497" wikidata="Q1174029" url="?curid=440497" title="David Cobb (activist)">
<text>David Keith Cobb is an American political activist who was the Green Party presidential candidate for the 2004 election. Cobb later became the campaign manager for fellow Green Jill Stein for her presidential run in 2016.

==2004 presidential campaign==

With the announcement in late December 2003 that Nader would not seek the Green Party nomination for president in 2004, Cobb became a front-runner for the nomination. On January 13, 2004, David Cobb won the first Green primary in the nation, that of the District of Columbia, beating local activist Sheila Bilyeu and several write-in candidates and gaining an early lead in the nomination scramble.

Nader eventually announced an independent campaign for president and sought the endorsement of the Green Party and other minor parties; his supporters continued to push for a Nader victory in the various Green Party primary elections in states across the country. Shortly before, the Green Party presidential nominating convention, held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in June 2004, Nader selected Green Party member Peter Camejo as his running mate. On June 26, on the second ballot, the convention selected Cobb as the Green presidential candidate – a process rocked by controversy as Nader had won the vast majority of actual Green Party votes in nearly all state primary elections (Cobb received only 12.2 percent support). The party also nominated Pat LaMarche as its candidate for vice-president.

Cobb stated his intention to run a campaign focused on building the Green Party and pursuing a &quot;strategic states&quot; or &quot;smart states&quot; strategy which would take into account the wishes of Greens in each state, and which otherwise would focus on states that traditionally are &quot;safely&quot; won by the Democratic candidate, or &quot;safely&quot; won by the Republican candidate, with a large margin of victory. Such so-called &quot;safe states&quot; are also referred to in campaign literature as &quot;neglected states&quot; because the Democratic and Republican candidates traditionally put most of their campaign energy into more competitive &quot;swing states.&quot; Cobb&#x27;s campaign said that each state&#x27;s campaign would aim to follow the wishes expressed by local Greens. While some of Cobb&#x27;s supporters urged swing state residents to vote for Democrat John Kerry in order to stop the re-election of President George W. Bush, other Cobb supporters encouraged votes for Cobb and LaMarche everywhere. The candidates themselves used the phrase &quot;vote your conscience,&quot; campaigning both in swing states such as Wisconsin and safe states such as California.

On October 8, 2004, Cobb was arrested in an act of civil disobedience, breaking a police line while protesting the Commission on Presidential Debates for excluding third-party candidates from the nationally televised debates in St. Louis, Missouri. Also arrested was Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik.

In the November 2004 presidential election, Cobb placed sixth in the popular vote total nationwide, earning over 119,859 votes (0.10 percent), but received no electoral votes. This represented a decline of over 90 percent support compared to the votes garnered by Nader.

==Post-election activities==
Since running for president, Cobb has become a member of the Board of Directors for the Green Institute, and of the Sierra Club&#x27;s national Corporate Accountability Committee, a Fellow with the Liberty Tree Foundation for the Democratic Revolution, on the Steering Committee of Democracy Unlimited of Humboldt County, along with being the group&#x27;s campaigns director, and is a Principal with Program on Corporations, Law, and Democracy (POCLAD).

Cobb facilitated the founding convention of the Green Party of Louisiana during a two-day convention which took place on August 31 and September 1, 2002, in New Orleans.

Cobb co-founded Cooperation Humboldt.

Cobb was the campaign manager for Green candidate Jill Stein in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

<doc id="440507" wikidata="Q742548" url="?curid=440507" title="Rob Blake">
<text>Robert Bowlby Blake (born December 10, 1969) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player. He is the current general manager of the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was originally drafted by the Kings in 1988, appearing in the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, winning the James Norris Memorial Trophy and serving as team captain for five seasons in his initial 11-season stint with the club. In 2001, Blake was traded to the Colorado Avalanche and was a member of their 2001 Stanley Cup championship team. It was his only Stanley Cup as a player, though he won the Cup again as a member of the Kings&#x27; front office in 2014. After a two-season return to Los Angeles, Blake signed with the San Jose Sharks in 2008, retiring as its captain after the 2009–10 season. Four years later, in 2014, Blake was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Internationally, Blake played for Canada in three consecutive Winter Olympics in 1998, 2002, and 2006, winning gold in 2002 and becoming the 11th member of the Triple Gold Club. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Playing career==

===Los Angeles Kings (1990–2001)===
Blake was selected 70th overall in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. He had completed his freshman year with Bowling Green State University of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) when he was drafted and went on to play three years total in the college ranks, earning CCHA and NCAA West first All-Star team honours in 1990. Blake was also the first player to ever receive the CCHA Best Offensive Defenseman award. Foregoing his final season of college eligibility, Blake joined the Kings for the final four games of the 1989–90 season before scoring 46 points in his NHL rookie campaign in 1990–91 to be named to the NHL All-Rookie Team.

After a 59-point campaign in his third season, Blake helped lead the Kings to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in five games by the Montreal Canadiens. The following season, in 1993–94, Blake improved to a career-high 48 assists and 68 points, but the Kings failed to qualify for the playoffs.

In a season where Blake was kept to just six games due to injury, the Kings traded captain Wayne Gretzky to the St. Louis Blues at the 1995–96 trade deadline, leaving the team&#x27;s captaincy vacant. Blake was named the 11th captain in team history prior to the 1996–97 season. In 1997–98, Blake received the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best defenceman after recording a career-high 23 goals to go with 50 points.

On February 21, 2001, with Blake about to become an unrestricted free agent in the 2001 off-season, the Kings traded him (with Steven Reinprecht) to the Colorado Avalanche for Adam Deadmarsh, Aaron Miller, Jared Aulin, and a first-round pick (used to select Dave Steckel).

===Colorado Avalanche (2001–2006)===
After 11 seasons in Los Angeles, Blake joined Colorado late in the 2000–01 season and made an immediate impact, scoring 10 points in the final 13 games of the regular season after being traded. In the 2001 playoffs, he played a second-round series against his former club, the Kings, before he won his first and only Stanley Cup with the Avalanche, adding 19 points in 23 playoff games. In totaling 59 points in 67 games in the regular season, Blake was selected to the NHL second All-Star team.

On July 1, 2001, Blake re-signed with the Avalanche in the off-season to a five-year contract with an optional sixth year. As the Avalanche&#x27;s top defenceman, Blake recorded his highest total with the Avalanche in recording 56 points in 75 games, third amongst NHL defenceman, in the 2001–02 season, before falling in their defence of the Stanley Cup in the Western Conference finals to the Detroit Red Wings. For his third successive season, Blake was selected to the NHL second All-Star team.

In the following 2002–03 season, Blake recorded his 500th career point against the Minnesota Wild on October 29, 2002. In finishing fifth in Norris Trophy voting, Blake placed second amongst Avalanche defenceman with 45 points in 79 games. In each of his first three seasons with the Avalanche, he was selected to the NHL All-Star Game, and in the 2003–04 campaign, he was selected as a starter for the 2004 All-Star Game in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He finished the season with the Avalanche, placing ninth in the NHL amongst defenceman with 46 points.

After losing a season to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Blake returned for his final season under contract with the Avalanche in 2005–06. He continued his scoring presence amongst the Avalanche in recording 51 points in 81 games, the seventh time in his career he surpassed the 50-point plateau. On April 3, 2006, against the Chicago Blackhawks, he scored his 200th career NHL goal to become just the 17th defenceman all-time to reach the mark.

===Return to Los Angeles (2006–2008)===
After five years with Colorado, the Avalanche did not pick up his option for the 2006–07 season, making him a free agent. On July 1, 2006, he re-signed with his former team, the Los Angeles Kings, for two years at $6 million per year.

Coming off a 51-point campaign with Colorado the previous year, Blake&#x27;s production dipped upon his return to Los Angeles. He recorded 34 points in 2006–07, his lowest total since 1996–97. Nevertheless, prior to the start of the 2007–08 season, Blake was renamed team captain on September 28, 2007, after Mattias Norström&#x27;s departure to the Dallas Stars.

===San Jose Sharks (2008–2010)===

After again becoming an unrestricted free agent, on July 3, 2008, Blake signed a one-year, US$5 million contract with the Kings&#x27; Pacific Division rival San Jose Sharks. Blake reached the 40-point plateau once more with the Sharks, tallying 10 goals and 35 assists in his first season in San Jose.

Blake extended his contract with the Sharks, re-signing for another year at $3.5 million to avoid free agency. Blake would be named captain of the Sharks approximately six weeks after previous captain Patrick Marleau was stripped of the role by Sharks management.

==Retirement==
On June 18, 2010, Blake announced his final retirement from professional hockey. On March 3, 2011, during a Los Angeles Kings telecast, Blake discussed his post-playing career as a hockey operations manager for the NHL, based in Toronto. Blake said, &quot;This job kind of developed over the summer (of 2010) in talking with Brendan Shanahan. I played for a while in the NHL (20 years). As a former player, I can provide the league with some insight in various aspects of the game. I was able to stay on the West Coast (and commute to Toronto for work), so it worked out really well.&quot; He continued, &quot;I watch the game much differently now, just because I&#x27;ve been in Toronto, in the war room. Now, I watch the game and see the calls that are made as well as the ones which weren&#x27;t but should have been.&quot;

On August 11, 2014, the Los Angeles Kings announced they would be retiring Blake&#x27;s number 4 jersey on January 17, 2015. He was later selected to the Colorado Avalanche&#x27;s 20th anniversary team honoured on December 8, 2015.

==Executive career==
Before the 2013–14 season, the Los Angeles Kings hired Blake as assistant general manager. The Kings won the Stanley Cup in his first year. As the assistant general manager to the Kings, he also acted as the general manager for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliates, the Manchester Monarchs (2013–2015) and the Ontario Reign (2015–).

Blake was also selected by Hockey Canada to be their general manager for the 2014 IIHF World Championship.

On April 10, 2017, the Kings named Blake the vice-president and general manager of the team.

==Personal life==
Blake and his wife Brandy have three children, sons Jack and Max, and daughter Brooke. His best friend is former NHL goaltender Dwayne Roloson, with whom he grew up playing hockey in Simcoe, Ontario. He is also distantly related to Hall of Famer Red Kelly. In 2008, Blake appeared in the Mike Myers film &quot;The Love Guru&quot; as himself. A short street in his hometown of Simcoe, Rob Blake Way, is named after him.

<text>Cleveland Public Power (also known as CPP) is a publicly owned electricity generation and distribution company in Cleveland, Ohio. It was founded in 1907 by then-Cleveland mayor Tom L. Johnson. Prior to 1983, it was known as Municipal Light (or &quot;Muny Light&quot; for short). CPP does not have sufficient capacity to compete across the entire Greater Cleveland area. Rather, it is intended to create additional capacity and to create a benchmark price in order to prevent price gouging by local private utilities and prevent the private market from controlling the city&#x27;s electricity supply for municipal services such as streetlights and buildings. CPP also provides power to Cleveland Browns Stadium.

In December 1978, Mayor Dennis Kucinich refused to sell the company when a number of banks, which were heavily invested in Muny Light&#x27;s largest privately owned competitor, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (better known as CEI or The Illuminating Company) refused to roll over the city&#x27;s debt, as had previously been customary. This was seen as a bad move at the time; unable to pay its debts, the city became the first since the Great Depression to enter default, which cost Kucinich his job in next year&#x27;s mayoral election. However, Kucinich&#x27;s decision was later vindicated by both city officials and the U.S. Senate, which found that CEI and the banks had acted improperly.

In December 2006, a new commissioner for CPP, Ivan Henderson, took over the reins from the incumbent James Majer. Under the new commissioner&#x27;s leadership, CPP took over streetlight maintenance within the city from CEI.

<text>Filip Kuba (born December 29, 1976) is a Czech former professional ice hockey defenseman. Kuba most recently played for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously played for the Minnesota Wild, Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Ottawa Senators of the NHL.

==Playing career==
Kuba was drafted in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers in the 8th round, 192nd overall, after playing with HC Vítkovice junior team in his native Czech Republic. Upon being drafted, he remained in the Czech Republic for one more season, playing with HC Vítkovice&#x27;s senior team of the Czech Extraliga.

Moving to North America, he played the majority of his four seasons with the Panthers in the minor leagues before being traded to the Calgary Flames for Rocky Thompson on March 16, 2000. Before the 2000–01 season began, Kuba was left unprotected by the Flames for the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft and was claimed by the Minnesota Wild.

He played his first full NHL season with the Wild in the subsequent season and recorded 9 goals and 30 points. In 2003, the Wild advanced to the playoff semifinals, defeating division rivals Colorado Avalanche and Vancouver Canucks before falling to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in four games. Kuba set career playoff marks, appearing in 18 games and scoring 8 points during Minnesota&#x27;s run. After five seasons with the Wild, he became an unrestricted free agent and on July 1, 2006, he signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He left the Wild as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in scoring among defensemen with 33 goals and 132 points in 357 games. During his time with Minnesota, he was named team captain on two occasions, in November 2001 and November 2005, as part of the Wild&#x27;s monthly rotating captaincy system. Kuba represented the Wild along with teammate Dwayne Roloson in the 2004 All-Star game.

In 2006–07, his first season with Tampa Bay, he recorded a career-high 15 goals, 22 assists and 37 points. On August 29, 2008, Kuba was traded to the Ottawa Senators, along with Alexandre Picard and San Jose&#x27;s first-round draft pick for defenseman Andrej Meszaros.

With Ottawa, Kuba broke an NHL record for defensemen with an assist on October 25, 2008, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, giving him at least one point in each of the team&#x27;s first eight games of the season. The previous best was set in 1981–82 by Brad Park, who recorded a point in each of the Boston Bruins&#x27; first seven games.

On July 1, 2012, Kuba returned to his original draft team, the Florida Panthers, signing a two-year contract worth $8 million. In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Kuba was unable to live up to his contract registering 10 points in 44 games for the cellar-dwelling Panthers. On July 3, 2013, Kuba was bought out from the remaining year of his deal with the Panthers.

==International play==
Kuba played his first game for the national team in 2001, and has played 30 times for the Czech national team (as of Jan 3 2009)

Played for the Czech Republic in:
*2001 World Championships (gold)
*2002 World Championships
*2006 Winter Olympics (bronze)
