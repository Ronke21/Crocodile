<text>The Focke-Wulf Fw 58 &quot;Weihe&quot; (Harrier) was a twin-engine multi-role aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf. 

It was developed in response to a request from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, which sought a multi-role aircraft that could be operated as an advanced trainer for pilots, gunners and radio operators alike. The resulting Fw 58 was a low-wing monoplane powered by a pair of Argus As 10C V-8 piston engines mounted in nacelles on the wing&#x27;s leading edges. The crew were seated under an enclosed canopy. Aft of the flight deck, the fuselage was open to form a moveable MG 15 machine gun station. The tailwheel undercarriage was retractable. The nose could either be glazer or faired over. The first prototype performed its maiden flight in 1935; the Fw 58 entered regular service two years later.

The Fw 58 was procured in large numbers by the Luftwaffe and thus was widely used across Germany for the training of several categories of military personnel. Furthermore, the type was routinely operated in other capacities, including as a VIP transport, air ambulance, feeder airliner, photo reconnaissance and weather research aircraft. It was also operated as an airliner by the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa. Several were owned by private pilots, including the aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank. Outside of Germany, the type was built under license by several other nations, including Bulgaria, Hungary and Brazil. Other nations that procured the Fw 58 included the Netherlands, Romania, Croatia and Turkey.

==Design and development==
Work on the Fw 58 commenced during the early 1930s; its development was closely paralleled by the Arado Ar 77, which was designed to fulfil the same specification.

The Fw 58 featured welded steel tube construction across its fuselage along with mixed materials for its covering. It had a semi-cantilever wing that was primarily metal, but made use of fabric aft of the spar. This wing was mounted relatively low on the fuselage, the centre sections of which were braced between the uppermost point of the engine mounting and the fuselage. In contrast, the tailplane, which was positioned forward of the fin, was braced from beneath via struts. The underside of both of the engine nacelles featured a recess into which the main undercarriage retracted into during flight. The Fw 58 was powered by a pair of Argus As 10C V-8 inverted air-cooled piston engines, capable of generating up to .

During 1935, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. It was quickly joined by the second prototype which, unlike the first, had been constructed to a military configuration; one of the more prominent visual differences between the two aircraft was the presence of defensive MG 15 machine guns in the nose and dorsal positions of the latter. The configuration of the second prototype, sometimes referred to as &quot;Fw 58A&quot;, did not actually correspond to many of the quantity production aircraft as production was quickly transitioned to the improved &quot;Fw 58B&quot;, which most closely corresponded to the design of the fourth prototype. This model featured the ability to carry bombs and could even be outfitted with floats; when in the latter configuration, the aircraft was designated as &quot;Fw 58BW&quot;. However, the definitive production model was the &quot;Fw 58C&quot;, which had a faired-in nose and could accommodate up to six passengers.

==Operational history==
A major customer for the Fw 58 was the Luftwaffe, a large number of its operational units were equipped with multiple aircraft, either Fw 58Bs or Fw 58Cs, for light transport and communications purposes. The type would see use as an air ambulance and several other secondary roles, including aerial application for agricultural products. At least 30 specially configurated Fw 58s were deployed to the Eastern Front to spray potential sources of disease for German ground forces.

Between 1938 and 1939, eight aircraft in an airliner were supplied to the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa. Furthermore, a few aircraft were used for various experimental purposes, including early trials of aerial refuelling apparatus. Numerous private pilots, including the aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank (who had headed the design of the Fw 58), operated the type as a personal aircraft.

==Variants==
;Fw 58 V1
:First prototype, first flown in 1934 
;Fw 58 V2

==Surviving aircraft==
The only Fw 58 on display is at Museu Aeroespacial in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Brazil used this airplane mainly for maritime patrols and the example on display was one of the 25 Fw 58B-2 units license-built in Brazil by Fábrica de Galeão, circa 1941.

An Fw 58 C-2 is stored in the Norwegian Aviation Museum in Bodø.

An Fw 58 C crashed on 30 March 1943 in the Lac du Bourget, France, after a low-flying training pass over the lake went wrong. Two of the four airmen on board were rescued by local fishermen. The wreckage lies at a depth of over 112 meters. Due to the dark and cold water, it is still fairly well preserved, though the canvas over the tube frame light structure is gradually deteriorating. A proposal has been made to raise the wreckage, but local divers are strongly opposed because of its status as a war grave, and the risks of damaging it.

<text>Banff and Macduff is a community council area in the Banff and Buchan committee area of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, with a community council. The community council area includes the two named towns and a rural area extending to the south west.

Banff and Macduff are two neighboring coastal towns on either side of the River Deveron, known for their intertwined history and long-established rivalry. They are often discussed together.

== History ==

Banff and Macduff have historically both been fishing towns. The two towns have been home to herring fishermen.

The origins of their rivalry can be traced back to the hanging of Scottish outlaw and folk hero Jamie Macpherson. A messenger with a pardon was reportedly on the way through Macduff before his execution, but the people of Banff set their clock tower to an earlier time so that he would be hung before the messenger arrived. The people of Macduff were more favorable to Macpherson and the actions in Banff led to a rivalry between the towns. The rivalry has been covered in media including &quot;The Herald&quot; in Scotland and &quot;CBC Radio&quot; in Canada, among others.

In 1883, Banff and Macduff had a population of around 9,000. In 1906, the Duke of Fife gifted the Duff House to Banff and Macduff.

Banff and Macduff railway station operated from 1860 to 1872 on the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway; it was renamed as Macduff (Banff) station in 1866. The 1950s saw opposition in Banff and Macduff to the closing of the passenger rail station. 

In 2013, the two towns fought over the legal ownership of the bridge between them. A councillor from Banff argued that historic maps showed part of the land near the bridge belonged to Banff and was incorrectly claimed by Macduff. A new bridge linking the two towns was proposed in 2021.

The two towns share the Banff and Macduff Lifeboat Station and the Banff and Macduff Heritage Trail. An annual bowling competition has been held between the two towns for more than one hundred years.

<text>Lord Macduff, the Thane of Fife, is a character and the heroic main protagonist in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; (c.1603–1607) that is loosely based on history. Macduff, a legendary hero, plays a pivotal role in the play: he suspects Macbeth of regicide and eventually kills Macbeth in the final act. He can be seen as the avenging hero who helps save Scotland from Macbeth&#x27;s tyranny in the play.

The character is first known from &quot;Chronica Gentis Scotorum&quot; (late 14th century) and &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot; (early 15th century). Shakespeare drew mostly from &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; (1587).

Although characterised sporadically throughout the play, Macduff serves as a foil to Macbeth and a figure of morality.

The overall plot that would serve as the basis for &quot;Macbeth&quot; is first seen in the writings of two chroniclers of Scottish history, John of Fordun, whose prose &quot;Chronica Gentis Scotorum&quot; was begun about 1363, and Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s Scots verse &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot;, written no earlier than 1420. These served as the basis for the account given in &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; (1587), on whose narratives of King Duff and King Duncan Shakespeare in part based &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

Historically, Duff was a 10th century King of Alba. In John of Fordun&#x27;s work, the reign of Duff is portrayed as having suffered from pervasive witchcraft. The Orygynale Cronykil suggests that Duff was murdered. Due to the Irish use of tanistry, Duff&#x27;s immediate descendants did not become rulers of Alba, and instead became mormaers of Fife. Their clan – the Clan MacDuff – remained the most powerful family in Fife in the Middle Ages.
The ruins of Macduff&#x27;s Castle lie in the village of East Wemyss next to the cemetery. Not only did history influence Shakespeare&#x27;s work, but the work itself influenced the role of future Duffs. Few could determine where Duff Family history began and historical fiction ended, working to the benefit of the Duffs as their reach expanded into Northeast Scotland. In 1404 David Duff received a charter in Aberdeenshire from Robert III of Scotland. In 1759, his descendant William Duff was granted the historic Celtic Title of &quot;Fife&quot;, resurrecting the title and tying the Duffs of Northeast Scotland, both to their 11th century Lowland ancestors, and to Shakespeare&#x27;s MacDuff. Various Fife titles were held by the Duffs until as recently as 1929 when the dignity passed to the Carnegie descendants, where it remains in use today. This association not only secured the Duff family influence in the peerage, but also helped ensure their position as one of the largest landowners in Scotland, heading countless feudal baronies including the barony of MacDuff, named for James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife.

In Holinshed&#x27;s narrative, attributes of King Duff are transposed onto the MacDuff mormaer from Macbeth&#x27;s era. Macduff first appears in Holinshed&#x27;s narrative of King Duncan after Macbeth has killed the latter and reigned as King of Scotland for 10 years. When Macbeth calls upon his nobles to contribute to the construction of Dunsinane castle, Macduff avoids the summons, arousing Macbeth&#x27;s suspicions. Macduff leaves Scotland for England to prod Duncan&#x27;s son, Malcolm III of Scotland, into taking the Scottish throne by force. Meanwhile, Macbeth murders Macduff&#x27;s family. Malcolm, Macduff, and the English forces march on Macbeth, and Macduff kills him. Shakespeare follows Holinshed&#x27;s account of Macduff closely, with his only deviations being Macduff&#x27;s discovery of Duncan&#x27;s body in act 2 sc. 3, and Macduff&#x27;s brief conference with Ross in act 2 sc. 4.

==Role in the play==
Macduff first speaks in the play in act 2, scene 3 to the drunken porter to report to his duty of awaking King Duncan when he is sleeping for the night at Macbeth&#x27;s castle. When he discovers the corpse of King Duncan (murdered by Macbeth, but it appears that nearby guards are guilty since Lady Macbeth put his knife by them and smeared them with Duncan&#x27;s blood), he raises an alarm, informing the castle that the king has been murdered. Macduff begins to suspect Macbeth of regicide when Macbeth says, &quot;O, yet I do repent me of my fury / That I did kill them&quot; (2.3.124–125). Macduff&#x27;s name does not appear in this scene; rather, Banquo refers to him as &quot;Dear Duff&quot; (2.3.105).

In 2.4 Macbeth has left for Scone, the ancient royal city where Scottish kings were crowned. Macduff, meanwhile, meets with Ross and an Old Man. He reveals that he will not be attending the coronation of Macbeth and will instead return to his home in Fife. However, Macduff flees to England to join Malcolm, the slain King Duncan&#x27;s elder son, and convinces him to return to Scotland and claim the throne.

Macbeth, meanwhile, visits the Three Witches again after the spectre of Banquo appears at the royal banquet. The Witches warn Macbeth to &quot;beware Macduff, beware the Thane of Fife&quot; (4.1.81–82). However, they inform Macbeth that &quot;none of woman born / Shall harm Macbeth&quot; (4.1.91–92) — leading one to infer that no human could possibly defeat Macbeth. Macbeth, fearing for his position as King of Scotland, learns soon afterward that Macduff has fled to England to try to raise an army against him and orders the deaths of Macduff&#x27;s wife, children, and other relatives. Macduff, who is still in England, learns of his family&#x27;s deaths through Ross, another Scottish thane. He joins Malcolm, and they return to Scotland with their English allies to face Macbeth at Dunsinane Castle.

After Macbeth slays the young Siward, Macduff charges into the main castle and confronts Macbeth. Although Macbeth believes that he cannot be killed by any man born of a woman, he soon learns that Macduff was &quot;from his mother&#x27;s womb / Untimely ripped&quot; (Act V Scene 8 lines 2493/2494) — meaning that Macduff was born by caesarean section. The two fight, and Macduff slays Macbeth offstage. Macduff ultimately presents Macbeth&#x27;s head to Malcolm, hailing him as king and calling on the other thanes to declare their allegiance with him (5.11.20–25).

==Analysis==

===Macduff as a foil to Macbeth===
As a supporting character, Macduff serves as a foil to Macbeth; his integrity directly contrasts with Macbeth&#x27;s moral perversion. The play positions the characters of Macduff as &quot;holy&quot; versus Macbeth as &quot;evil&quot;.

The contrast between Macduff and Macbeth is accentuated by their approaches to death. Macduff, hearing of his family&#x27;s death, reacts with a tortured grief. His words, &quot;But I must also feel it as a man&quot; (4.3.223), indicate a capacity for emotional sensitivity. While Macbeth and Lady Macbeth insist that manhood implies a denial of feeling (1.7.45–57), Macduff insists that emotional sense and depth are part of what it means to be a man. This interpretation is supported by contrasting Macbeth&#x27;s famous response to the news of Lady Macbeth&#x27;s death:
: &quot;She should have died hereafter
: There would have been a time for such a word
: Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow&quot; (5.5.17–19).
Macbeth&#x27;s words seem to express a brutal indifference – that someday, she would have died anyway – and perhaps even suggest that he has lost the capacity to feel.

Compare Macduff&#x27;s reaction upon his discovery of Duncan&#x27;s corpse: He struggles to find the words to express his rage and anguish, crying, &quot;O horror, horror, horror&quot; (2.3.59). In some stage interpretations, Macduff&#x27;s character transitions from a state of shock to one of frenzied alarm. When Ross announces his wife and children&#x27;s deaths to him, Macduff&#x27;s expression of grief contrasts starkly with Macbeth&#x27;s resignation to Lady Macbeth&#x27;s death.

===Macduff as a moral figure===
Although Macduff comes to represent a type of &quot;goodness&quot; in the dark world of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Shakespeare also allows for some instability in his character. This becomes most evident in 4.3, when Macduff joins Malcolm in England. In this scene, the play has moved from the tumult in Scotland to England.

<text>Diorite ( ) is an intrusive igneous rock formed by the slow cooling underground of magma (molten rock) that has a moderate content of silica and a relatively low content of alkali metals. It is intermediate in composition between low-silica (mafic) gabbro and high-silica (felsic) granite.

Diorite is found in mountain-building belts (&quot;orogens&quot;) on the margins of continents. It has the same composition as the fine-grained volcanic rock, andesite, which is also common in orogens.

Diorite has been used since prehistoric times as decorative stone. It was used by the Akkadian Empire of Sargon of Akkad for funerary sculptures, and by many later civilizations for sculptures and building stone.

==Description==

Diorite is an intrusive igneous rock composed principally of the silicate minerals plagioclase feldspar (typically andesine), biotite, hornblende, and sometimes pyroxene. The chemical composition of diorite is intermediate, between that of mafic gabbro and felsic granite. It is distinguished from gabbro on the basis of the composition of the plagioclase species; the plagioclase in diorite is richer in sodium and poorer in calcium.
Geologists use rigorous quantitative definitions to classify coarse-grained igneous rocks, based on the mineral content of the rock. For igneous rocks composed mostly of silicate minerals, and in which at least 10% of the mineral content consists of quartz, feldspar, or feldspathoid minerals, classification begins with the QAPF diagram. The relative abundances of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P), and feldspathoid (F), are used to plot the position of the rock on the diagram. The rock will be classified as either a dioritoid or a gabbroid if quartz makes up less than 20% of the QAPF content, feldspathoid makes up less than 10% of the QAPF content, and plagioclase makes up more than 65% of the total feldspar content. Dioritoids are distinguished from gabbroids by an anorthite (calcium plagioclase) fraction of their total plagioclase of less than 50%.

The composition of the plagioclase cannot easily be determined in the field, and then a preliminary distinction is made between dioritoid and gabbroid based on the content of mafic minerals. A dioritoid typically has less than 35% mafic minerals, typically including hornblende, while a gabbroid typically has over 35% mafic minerals, mostly pyroxenes or olivine. The name &quot;diorite&quot; (from Ancient Greek , &quot;to distinguish&quot;) was first applied to the rock by René Just Haüy on account of its characteristic, easily identifiable large crystals of hornblende.

Dioritoids form a family of rock types similar to diorite, such as monzodiorite, quartz diorite, or nepheline-bearing diorite. Diorite itself is more narrowly defined, as a dioritoid in which quartz makes up less than 5% of the QAPF content, feldspathoids are not present, and plagioclase makes up more than 90% of the feldspar content.

Diorite may contain small amounts of quartz, microcline, and olivine. Zircon, apatite, titanite, magnetite, ilmenite, and sulfides occur as accessory minerals. Varieties deficient in hornblende and other dark minerals are called &quot;leucodiorite&quot;. A &quot;ferrodiorite&quot; is a dioritoid enriched in iron and titanium. Ferrodiorites are common in the lower oceanic crust.

Coarse-grained (phaneritic) dioritoids are produced by slow crystallization of magma having the same composition as the lava that solidifies rapidly to form fine-grained (aphanitic) andesite. Rock of similar composition to diorite or andesite but with an intermediate texture is sometimes called &quot;microdiorite&quot;. Diorite is occasionally porphyritic. It usually contains enough mafic minerals to be dark in appearance. &quot;Orbicular diorite&quot; shows alternating concentric growth bands of plagioclase and amphibole surrounding a nucleus, within a diorite porphyry matrix.

==Occurrence==
Diorite results from the partial melting of a mafic rock above a subduction zone. It is found in volcanic arcs, and in cordilleran mountain building, such as in the Andes Mountains. However, while its extrusive volcanic equivalent, andesite, is common in these settings, diorite is a minor component of the plutonic rocks, which are mostly granodiorite or granite. Diorite also makes up some stocks intruded beneath large calderas.
Diorite source localities include Leicestershire and Aberdeenshire, UK; Thuringia and Saxony in Germany; Finland; Romania; central Sweden; southern Vancouver Island around Victoria, Canada; the Darran Range of New Zealand; the Andes Mountains; and Concordia in South Africa. Hornblende diorite is a common rock type in the Henry, Abajo, and La Sal Mountains of Utah, US, where it was emplaced as laccoliths.

An orbicular variety found in Corsica was formerly called &quot;corsite&quot;. An obsolete name for microdiorite, &quot;markfieldite&quot;, was given by Frederick Henry Hatch in 1909 to exposures near the village of Markfield, England. Esterellite is a local name for microdiorite given by Auguste Michel-Lévy to exposures in the Esterel Massif in France.

==Use==
Human use of diorite dates at least to the Middle Neolithic, when it was used in a passage grave at Le Dolmen du Mont Ubé, Jersey. The use of stone of contrasting colour suggests that diorite was deliberately selected for its appearance.

The first great Mesopotamian empire, the Akkadian Empire of Sargon of Akkad, began using diorite for sculpture after sources of the rock came under Akkadian control. Diorite was used to depict rulers or high officials in ceremonial poses or attitudes of prayer, and the sculptures may have been designed to receive funerary offerings. Diorite was also used for stone vases by Bronze Age craftspeople, who developed considerable skill at polishing diorite and other stones. The Egyptians had become skilled at shaping diorite and other hard stones by 4000 BCE. A large diorite stela in the Louvre Museum dating to 1700 BCE is inscribed with the Code of Hammurabi.

Diorite was used by the Inca civilization as structural stone. It was used by medieval Islamic builders to construct water fountains in the Crimea. In later times, diorite was commonly used as cobblestone; today many diorite cobblestone streets can be found in England and Guernsey. Guernsey diorite was used in the steps of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

Today, diorite is uncommon in construction, although it shares similar physical properties with granite. Diorite is often sold commercially as &quot;black granite&quot;. Diorite&#x27;s modern uses include construction aggregate, curbing, usage as dimension stones, cobblestone, and facing stones.

<text>The Comedy Store is a comedy club located in Soho, London, England, opened in 1979 by Don Ward and Peter Rosengard.

==Early history==
Since 16 January 1925 David Tennant&#x27;s Gargoyle private members&#x27; club had leased the three top floors of 69 Dean Street, Soho, London (at the corner with Meard Street). In 1952 David Tennant sold the Gargoyle as a going concern for £5,000 to caterer John Negus. In 1955 the club was sold on to Michael Klinger and Jimmy Jacobs who relaunched it as a strip club called the &quot;Nell Gwynne&quot; (variously advertised as a theatre, club, or revue). A 1960s ad shows the club as the &quot;Nell Gwynne&quot; by day and the &quot;Gargoyle Club&quot; at night.

==The Comedy Store==
In 1978, Peter Rosengard was on holiday with his wife Irkku in Los Angeles.
&quot;We had nothing to do one night, so I asked the concierge and he recommended the Comedy Store. At the time there was no live comedy in the UK, apart from working men&#x27;s clubs up north, which was not really my scene. I loved what I saw in LA, so decided to open one in London, despite everybody telling me I was nuts.&quot;

In 1979, the Gargoyle&#x27;s upper rooms took in a varied series of weekly themed club-nights, in addition to the long-running &quot;Nell Gwynne Revue&quot; strip show. Don Ward said Rosengard could use his premises on Saturday nights. But it was also a strip club with topless barmaids, which Peter had to explain when comedians came to audition.

On Saturdays, beginning 19 May 1979, in the Gargoyle&#x27;s rooftop club space Hammersmith-born insurance salesman Peter Rosengard started a weekly club-night on Saturdays called the Comedy Store, in partnership with comedian Don Ward. It was open mic, in a &quot;Gong Show&quot; format, and invited audiences to show approval or disapproval of the unknown acts performing by &quot;gonging&quot; them off. There was no toilet in the dressing room, and male and female comedians used the sink.

&quot;On 19 May 1979, only sixteen days after Margaret Thatcher’s first general election victory, a new comedy club opened in London, hosted in a Soho topless bar named the Gargoyle, accessed through the Nell Gwynne strip club in Dean Street. The Comedy Store was the brainchild of insurance salesman Peter Rosengard, who teamed up with local businessman Don Ward, having been inspired by the Los Angeles Comedy Store while on holiday.&quot;

&quot;In the old days, there was a cross-over between stripping and comedy. 69 Dean Street was the Nell Gwynne strip club until about 11 o’clock and then it suddenly turned into The Comedy Store. When it got successful, they stopped doing the stripping on Friday and Saturday and they did two comedy shows – an 8 o’clock and a midnight. If you were on the circuit then, you’d do first act in the first house at the Comedy Store, then go off and do a pub in Stoke Newington or wherever, then rush back and do second or third on the bill in the second show at the Comedy Store. If you were good, you were working in more than one place. Everyone worked round each other and there was a cross-over between street acts and alternative acts&quot; Philip Herbert

==Careers==
The London Comedy Store made the reputations of many of the UK&#x27;s upcoming &quot;alternative comedians&quot; while the specifically political Alternative Cabaret was taking root.

Among the original line-up who made their reputations here were Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, French &amp; Saunders, Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson who in 1980 led these pioneers to establish the breakaway Comic Strip team elsewhere in Soho. All were to prove influential in reshaping British television comedy throughout the 1980s as stars of &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot;.

The Comedy Store, at the Gargoyle and elsewhere, helped start the careers of Paul Merton, Ben Elton, Keith Allen, Jo Brand, Mark Thomas, Arnold Brown, Andrew Bailey, Pat Condell and John Sparkes.

Comedian Paul Merton is one of the longest performing mainstream comics to still be associated with the venue from his debut performance in 1984. He presented a BBC 1 documentary, &quot;25 Years of the Comedy Store – A Personal History by Paul Merton&quot; (11 January 2005).

In 2016 British artist Carl Randall painted the portrait of comedian Jo Brand standing in front of The Comedy Store, as part of the artist&#x27;s &#x27;London Portraits&#x27; series, where he asked various cultural figures to choose a place in London for the backdrop of their portraits. In an interview Brand explained why she chose The Comedy Store for her portrait, and her experiences performing there early in her career.

==Groups==
In October 1985, an improvisational group called The Comedy Store Players was formed, consisting of Mike Myers, Neil Mullarkey, Kit Hollerbach, Dave Cohen and Paul Merton. The group has had several line-up changes over the years, and now features a rotating team of Neil Mullarkey, Josie Lawrence, Richard Vranch and Lee Simpson, together with frequent guest appearances. Jim Sweeney was a member until retiring from performance in 2008 due to multiple sclerosis. Andy Smart was a member until his death in May 2023. Several of The Comedy Store Players appeared on the BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4 comedy game show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;.

In 1990 &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; satirical comedy team was formed by comedy journalist John Connor (formerly comedy editor at radical London listings magazine &quot;City Limits&quot;). The original team was Mark Thomas, Kevin Day, Bob Boyton, Nick Revill and Richard Morton. The show&#x27;s aim was to recapture the political edge that was fostered at the original Comedy Store.

==Venues==
Don Ward dissolved his business relationship with Rosengard in late 1981. Ward remained CEO of Comedy Store interests.

In 1982 when the upper floors were sold off, the Comedy Store moved to a series of other venues. In late 1982, The Comedy Store operated from 28a Leicester Square (The 400 Club) for two years, taking over the club in 1985.

In 1993, The Store moved to a specifically designed stand-up comedy venue, at 1a Oxendon Street, between Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square.

In 1984 Rosengard went on to manage the band Curiosity Killed the Cat.

The Comedy Store also has sister venues in Manchester (opened in 2000), and Bournemouth (2006). There was also a venue at the Merrion Centre in Leeds which opened in November 2003 but closed in June 2004.

<doc id="443371" wikidata="Q2123673" url="?curid=443371" title="Anapanasati">
<text> (Pali; Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;mindfulness of breathing&quot; ( means mindfulness; refers to inhalation and exhalation), is the act of paying attention to the breath. It is the quintessential form of Buddhist meditation, attributed to Gautama Buddha, and described in several suttas, most notably the &quot;Ānāpānasati Sutta&quot; (MN 118).

Derivations of anāpānasati are common to Tibetan, Zen, Tiantai, and Theravada Buddhism as well as Western-based mindfulness programs.

== Contemplation of bodily phenomena ==
The &quot;Ānāpānasati Sutta&quot; prescribes mindfulness of inhalation and exhalation as an element of mindfulness of the body, and recommends the practice of mindfulness of breathing as a means of cultivating the seven factors of awakening, which is an alternative formulation or description of the process of &quot;dhyana&quot;: sati (mindfulness), dhamma vicaya (analysis), viriya (persistence), pīti (rapture), passaddhi (serenity), samadhi (unification of mind), and upekkhā (equanimity). According to this and other sutras, the development of these factors leads to release (Pali: &#x27;; Sanskrit: &#x27;) from dukkha (suffering) and the attainment of nirvana.

Derivations of anāpānasati are a core meditation practice in Theravada, Tiantai, and Chan traditions of Buddhism as well as a part of Western-based mindfulness programs. According to Anālayo, in both ancient and modern times anāpānasati by itself is likely the most widely used Buddhist method for contemplating bodily phenomena.

== The practice ==
===&quot;Ānāpānasati sutta&quot;===
The mindfulness practice described in the &quot;Ānāpānasati Sutra&quot; is to go into the forest and sit beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath:
While inhaling and exhaling, the meditator practises:
*training the mind to be sensitive to one or more of: the entire body, rapture, pleasure, the mind itself, and mental processes;
*training the mind to be focused on one or more of inconstancy, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment;
*steadying, satisfying, or releasing the mind.

If this practice is pursued and well developed, it is said by the Buddha to bring great benefit, aiding the development of mindfulness as one of the factors of awakening:
===Post-canonical development===

A popular post-canonical method still used today, follows four stages:

# repeatedly counting exhalations in cycles of 10
# repeatedly counting inhalations in cycles of 10
# focusing on the breath without counting
# focusing only on the spot where the breath enters and leaves the nostrils (i.e., the nostril and upper lip area)

Counting the breath is attributed by the Theravada tradition to Buddhaghosa&#x27;s commentary the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, but Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot; also teaches the counting of breaths to ten. The dhyāna sutras, based on Sarvastivada practices and translated into Chinese by An Shigao, also recommends counting the breath, and forms the basis of Zen practices. In the dhyana sutras his is organized into a teaching called &quot;the six aspects&quot; or &quot;the six means&quot; in which, according to Florin Deleanu:

===Modern sources===
Traditional anāpānasati teaches to observe inhalation and exhalation by focusing on the air coming in and out the nostrils, but followers of the Burmese Vipassana movement instead recommend focusing on the abdomen&#x27;s movement during the act of breathing. Other Buddhist schools also teach that as an alternative point of focus.

According to John Dunne, for the practice to be successful, one should dedicate to the practice, and set out the goal of the meditation session. According to Philip Kapleau, in Zen practice one may decide to either practice anāpānasati while seated or standing or lying down or walking, or while alternating seated, standing, lying down, and walking meditation. Then one may concentrate on the breath going through one&#x27;s nose: the pressure in the nostrils on each inhalation, and the feeling of the breath moving along the upper lip on each exhalation. Other times practitioners are advised to attend to the breath at the tanden, a point slightly below the navel and beneath the surface of the body. Practitioners may choose to count each inhalation, &quot;1, 2, 3...&quot; and so on, up to 10, and then begin from 1 again. Alternatively people sometimes also count the exhalation: &quot;1, 2, 3...&quot;, on both the inhalation and exhalation. If the count is lost then one should start again from the beginning.

The type of practice recommended in &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot; is for one to count &quot;1, 2, 3...&quot; on the inhalation for a while, then to eventually switch to counting on the exhalation, then eventually, once one has more consistent success in keeping track of the count, to begin to pay attention to the breath without counting. There are practitioners who count the breath all their lives as well. Beginning students are often advised to keep a brief daily practice of around 10 or 15 minutes a day. Also, a teacher or guide of some sort is often considered to be essential in Buddhist practice, as well as the sangha, or community of Buddhists, for support.

When one becomes distracted from the breath, which happens to both beginning and adept practitioners, either by a thought or something else, then one simply returns one’s attention back to the breath. Philippe Goldin has said that important &quot;learning&quot; occurs at the moment when practitioners turn their attention back to the object of focus, the breath.

===Active breathing, passive breathing===

Ānāpānasati is most commonly practiced with attention centered on the breath, without any effort to change the breathing.

In the throat singing prevalent amongst the Buddhist monks of Tibet and Mongolia, the long and slow outbreath during chanting is the core of the practice. The sound of the chant also serves to focus the mind in one-pointed concentration (&quot;samadhi&quot;), while the sense of self dissolves as awareness becomes absorbed into a realm of pure sound.

In some Japanese Zen meditation, the emphasis is upon maintaining &quot;strength in the abdominal area&quot; (Chinese: ; Japanese: ) and slow deep breathing during the long outbreath, again to assist the attainment of a mental state of one-pointed concentration. There is also a &quot;bamboo method&quot;, during which time one inhales and exhales in punctuated bits, as if running one&#x27;s hand along the stalk of a bamboo tree.

Pranayama, or Yogic breath control, is very popular in traditional and modern forms of Yoga.

===Scientifically demonstrated benefits===

The practice of focusing one&#x27;s attention changes the brain in ways to improve that ability over time; the brain grows in response to meditation. Meditation can be thought of as mental training, similar to learning to ride a bike or play a piano.

Meditators experienced in focused attention meditation (of which ānāpānasati is one type) showed a decrease in habitual responding in a 20-minute Stroop test, which, as suggested by Richard Davidson and colleagues, may illustrate a lessening of emotionally reactive and automatic responding behavior. It has been scientifically demonstrated that ānāpānasati enhances connectivity in the brain.

==In the Theravada tradition==

=== Abhidhamma ===
The Abhidhamma literature discerns sixteen stages – or contemplations – of ānāpānasati. These are divided into four tetrads (i.e., four groups of four). The first four steps involve focusing the mind on breathing, which is the &#x27;body-conditioner&#x27; (). The second tetrad involves focusing on the feelings (), which are the &#x27;mind-conditioner&#x27; (). The third tetrad involves focusing on the mind itself (), and the fourth on &#x27;mental qualities&#x27; (). (Compare right mindfulness and satipatthana.)

Any anapanasati meditation session should progress through the stages in order, beginning at the first, whether the practitioner has performed all stages in a previous session or not.

===Contemporary interpretations===
According to several teachers in Theravada Buddhism, anapanasati alone will lead to the removal of all one&#x27;s defilements (&quot;kilesa&quot;) and eventually to enlightenment. According to Roger Bischof, the Ven. Webu Sayadaw said of anapanasati: &quot;This is a shortcut to Nibbana, anyone can use it. It stands up to investigation and is in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha as conserved in the scriptures. It is the straight path to Nibbana.&quot;

Anapanasati can also be practised with other traditional meditation subjects including the four frames of reference and mettā bhāvanā, as is done in modern Theravadan Buddhism.

==In the Chinese tradition==
In the second century, the Buddhist monk An Shigao came from Northwest India to China and became one of the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. He translated a version of the &quot;Ānāpānasmṛti Sūtra&quot; between 148 and 170 CE. Though once believed to have been lost, the original translation was rediscovered at Amanosan Kongō-ji, Osaka, Japan, by Professor Ochiai Toshinori in 1999. Its commentary, on the other hand, is a significantly longer text than what appears in the &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot;, and is entitled, &quot;The Great Ānāpānasmṛti Sūtra&quot; (Ch. 大安般守意經) (Taishō Tripiṭaka 602).

At a later date, Buddhacinga, more commonly known as Fotudeng (佛圖澄) (231–349 CE), came from Central Asia to China in 310 and propagated Buddhism widely. He is said to have demonstrated many spiritual powers, and was able to convert the warlords in this region of China over to Buddhism. He is well known for teaching methods of meditation, and especially ānāpānasmṛti. Fotudeng widely taught ānāpānasmṛti through methods of counting breaths, so as to temper to the breathing, simultaneously focusing the mind into a state of peaceful meditative concentration. By teaching meditation methods as well as doctrine, Fotudeng popularized Buddhism quickly. According to Nan Huaijin, &quot;Besides all its theoretical accounts of emptiness and existence, Buddhism also offered methods for genuine realization of spiritual powers and meditative concentration that could be relied upon. This is the reason that Buddhism began to develop so vigorously in China with Fotudeng.&quot;

As more monks such as Kumārajīva, Dharmanandi, Gautama Saṃghadeva, and Buddhabhadra came to the East, translations of meditation texts did as well, which often taught various methods of ānāpānasmṛti that were being used in India. These became integrated in various Buddhist traditions, as well as into non-Buddhist traditions such as Daoism.

In the sixth century, the Tiantai school was formed, teaching the One Vehicle (), the vehicle of attaining Buddhahood, as the main principle, and three forms of &quot;śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot; correlated with the meditative perspectives of emptiness, provisional existence, and the mean, as the method of cultivating realization. The Tiantai school places emphasis on ānāpānasmṛti in accordance with the principles of and . In China, the Tiantai understanding of meditation has had the reputation of being the most systematic and comprehensive of all. The founder of the Tiantai school, Zhiyi, wrote many commentaries and treatises on meditation. Of these texts, Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Concise Śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot; (), his &quot;Mahāśamatha Vipaśyanā&quot; (), and his &quot;Six Subtle Dharma Gates&quot; () are the most widely read in China. Zhiyi classifies breathing into four main categories: panting (), unhurried breathing (), deep and quiet breathing (), and stillness or rest (). Zhiyi holds that the first three kinds of breathing are incorrect, while the fourth is correct, and that the breathing should reach stillness and rest. Venerable Hsuan Hua, who taught Chan and Pure Land Buddhism, also taught that the external breathing reaches a state of stillness in correct meditation:
==In the Indo-Tibetan tradition==
In the Tibetan Buddhist lineage, ānāpānasmṛti is done to calm the mind in order to prepare one for various other practices.

Two of the most important Mahāyāna philosophers, Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, in the &quot;Śrāvakabhūmi&quot; chapters of the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra&quot; and the &quot;Abhidharma-kośa&quot;, respectively, make it clear that they consider ānāpānasmṛti a profound practice leading to &quot;vipaśyanā&quot; (in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha in the &quot;Sutta Piṭaka&quot;). However, as scholar Leah Zahler has demonstrated, &quot;the practice traditions related to Vasubandhu&#x27;s or Asaṅga&#x27;s presentations of breath meditation were probably not transmitted to Tibet.&quot; Asaṅga correlates the sixteen stages of ānāpānasmṛti with the four smṛtyupasthānas in the same way that the &quot;Ānāpānasmṛti Sutra&quot; does, but because he does not make this explicit the point was lost on later Tibetan commentators.

As a result, the largest Tibetan lineage, the Gelug, came to view ānāpānasmṛti as a mere preparatory practice useful for settling the mind but nothing more. Zahler writes:
Zahler continues,
Stephen Batchelor, who for years was a monk in the Gelukpa lineage, experienced this firsthand. He writes, &quot;such systematic practice of mindfulness was not preserved in the Tibetan traditions. The Gelugpa lamas know about such methods and can point to long descriptions of mindfulness in their Abhidharma works, but the living application of the practice has largely been lost. (Only in &quot;dzog-chen&quot;, with the idea of &#x27;awareness&#x27; [&quot;rig pa&quot;] do we find something similar.) For many Tibetans the very term &#x27;mindfulness&#x27; (&quot;sati&quot; in Pali, rendered in Tibetan by &quot;dran pa&quot;) has come to be understood almost exclusively as &#x27;memory&#x27; or &#x27;recollection&#x27;.&quot;

As Batchelor noted, however, in other traditions, particularly the Kagyu and Nyingma, mindfulness based on ānāpānasmṛti practice is considered to be quite profound means of calming the mind to prepare it for the higher practices of Dzogchen and Mahamudra. For the Kagyupa, in the context of mahāmudrā, ānāpānasmṛti is thought to be the ideal way for the meditator to transition into taking the mind itself as the object of meditation and generating vipaśyanā on that basis. The prominent contemporary Kagyu/Nyingma master Chogyam Trungpa, echoing the Kagyu Mahāmudrā view, wrote, &quot;your breathing is the closest you can come to a picture of your mind. It is the portrait of your mind in some sense... The traditional recommendation in the lineage of meditators that developed in the Kagyu-Nyingma tradition is based on the idea of mixing mind and breath.&quot; The Gelukpa allow that it is possible to take the mind itself as the object of meditation, however, Zahler reports, the Gelukpa discourage it with &quot;what seems to be thinly disguised sectarian polemics against the Nyingma Great Completeness [Dzogchen] and Kagyu Great Seal [mahāmudrā] meditations.&quot;

In the &quot;Pañcakrama&quot; tantric tradition ascribed to (the Vajrayana) Nagarjuna, ānāpānasmṛti counting breaths is said to be sufficient to provoke an experience of vipaśyanā (although it occurs in the context of &quot;formal tantric practice of the completion stage in highest yogatantra&quot;).

<text>Peter Richardson (born 15 October 1951) is an English director, screenwriter, actor and comedian. He founded the Comic Strip troupe of performers, which showcased his double act with Nigel Planer and boosted the careers of French and Saunders, Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, and Alexei Sayle. Richardson approached Channel 4 to make a series of short, self-contained one-off comedy films with this group, which led to &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot;, the majority of which featured Richardson in acting, writing and directing roles.

Richardson began his career as a teenager acting in Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Forty Years On&quot;, before he trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School from 1971 to 1973. He later created his own experimental theatre shows with Nigel Planer amongst others, mixing comedy and improvisation with rock music. Two of these shows, &quot;Rank&quot; and &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, toured nationally.

Although he did not reach the same level of public recognition as some of his contemporaries, Richardson was influential on British television comedy throughout the 1980s as the driving force behind &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; films, first shown on Channel 4 in 1982. The series was one of the first examples of alternative comedy to appear on British television. Richardson has been involved in the production of over 40 Comic Strip films and has directed 17 of them. The series won a Rose D&#x27;Or for &quot;The Strike&quot; in 1988. He developed the series into feature films; &quot;The Supergrass&quot;, &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;, &quot;The Pope Must Die&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, none of which achieved great box office success. In the 1990s, Richardson introduced a new generation of performers: Doon Mackichan, Mark Caven, Phil Cornwell, Sara Stockbridge, George Yiasoumi and Gary Beadle, who appeared in his productions. He co-wrote and directed the 1990s cult mockumentary comedy series &quot;Stella Street&quot; with Phil Cornwell and John Sessions. In 2004, Richardson co-founded, with Nick Smith, the production company Great Western Features, based in Totnes, Devon. In 2005, he directed the Comic Strip film &quot;Sex Actually&quot;. In the 2010s, Richardson wrote and directed three more Comic Strip films: 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Hunt for Tony Blair&quot;, 2012&#x27;s &quot;Five Go To Rehab&quot; and 2016&#x27;s &quot;Red Top&quot;. In a July 2021 interview, Richardson said he is putting together a book on The Comic Strip due to come out in 2022.

== Early life ==
Richardson was born on 15 October 1951 in Newton Abbot, Devon, England and lived in a house near Denbury. His parents ran a children&#x27;s summer camp school. The family moved to Dartmoor when Richardson was ten. Richardson describes himself as &quot;a Devonian, honest, cream on first every time.&quot; Richardson would go on to set a number of his films in Devon, and found his production company there. At one point he was a lifeguard at a Devon swimming pool, despite having failed the swimming test, &quot;but they still hired me as they were so short staffed.&quot; The family did not have a television, but his father had a cine camera with which they would make films. Richardson credits this as the beginning of his interest in filmmaking. Encouraged by his parents, he moved to London when he was seventeen, having decided he wanted to be an actor. 

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Richardson appeared as one of the schoolboys in Alan Bennett&#x27;s Forty Years On, starring John Gielgud and Paul Eddington. This work led to him getting an agent and performing in TV plays as an extra. He then attended the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. It was here in the second year he became reacquainted with Nigel Planer, who had worked at Richardson&#x27;s parents&#x27; summer camp. The pair shared an interest in rock music, and wanted to mix music with a comedy show; in Richardson&#x27;s words &quot;we felt we&#x27;d like to try something like what Frank Zappa was doing on records, which was being funny but using music as well.&quot;. Around this time Richardson and Planer were heavily influenced by U.S. comedians Sal&#x27;s Meat Market, an early duo of John Ratzenberger and Ray Hassett, as well as the group Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias.

With the assistance of Caroline Jay, they produced a show called &quot;Rank&quot;, inspired by the police raid of the 1974 Windsor Free Festival, which premiered at the Roundhouse Downstairs in August 1976. Planer and Richardson played all the characters in the play, which numbered around forty. The play was well received and enabled the pair to get an Arts Council grant to take it on tour. Despite the critical acclaim, at the end of the tour Richardson and Planer found themselves with no money and had to pursue other work, with Richardson squatting in London.

After &quot;Rank,&quot; Richardson toured with a band in Italy and also helped run drama courses for children at his parents&#x27; house in Devon. One of the dramas produced from these courses became a show called &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, based on the book by William Burroughs. Richardson performed this show at the ICA in London as well as touring the show with the group Furious Pig. Through this, Richardson first met Michael White, with whom he planned to take the show into the West End, although this came to nothing. He worked as an extra on Michael Palin&#x27;s Ripping Yarns&#x27; second series in 1979, appearing as a German spy pretending to be a Cornish fisherman, in Whinfrey&#x27;s Last Case.

=== &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; ===
Richardson and Planer started performing at London&#x27;s Comedy Store in 1979, calling themselves &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. They performed short sketches parodying different television styles, for example sitcom and American police drama. They used visual comedy and often mimed over-the-top scenes of cartoon violence. At this point, various television companies were taking note of the rapidly growing &quot;alternative comedy&quot; scene, BBC producer Paul Jackson being the first to commission a programme from regular performers at the Comedy Store. This became 1980&#x27;s &quot;Boom Boom...Out Go The Lights&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s decision to only showcase solo performers, featuring Planer&#x27;s Neil character instead of The Outer Limits as a duo angered Richardson, who began a long-standing feud with Jackson. Mike in BBC comedy &quot;The Young Ones&quot; was written with Richardson in mind but he did not take part for reasons partly connected to his earlier disagreement with Paul Jackson and due to his commitments with The Comic Strip. Richardson was replaced by Christopher Ryan. The Outer Limits were hired by Kevin Rowland as an opening act for Dexy&#x27;s Midnight Runners on their tour of &quot;The Projected Passion Revue &quot;in 1981.

=== The Comic Strip Presents... ===
As a result of searching for a West End venue to stage &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, Richardson and Michael White found a new possible venue for his comedy club, the Boulevard Theatre in the Raymond Revue Bar, run by Paul Raymond. Richardson called it &quot;The Comic Strip&quot;, taking with him a core group from the Comedy Store. It opened in October 1980 and ran until 1981, when the troupe went on a national tour. Richardson approached producer Mike Bolland, the new Channel Four youth and entertainment commissioning editor to propose a series of Comic Strip films for the channel. Bolland agreed to his proposal, his first commission for the station and Jeremy Isaacs quickly approved the budget. The series opener, &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot; was the first comedy shown on the new channel on its opening night in November 1982.

&quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; ran from 1982 to 1988 on Channel 4 and then continued from 1990 to 1993 on the BBC. Richardson wrote more than half of the shows together with his writing partner Pete Richens, and he also directed most of the BBC series. In 1998 Richardson, Planer, Mayall and Edmondson reunited to appear in new film &quot;Four Men in a Car&quot;, about four obnoxious sales representatives. This was followed up by 2000s &quot;Four Men in a Plane&quot;. Richardson returned to Channel 4 with the Comic Strip film, &quot;Sex Actually&quot; in 2005. In 2011, he wrote and directed &quot;The Hunt for Tony Blair&quot;. In 2012, he wrote and directed, &quot;Five Go To Rehab&quot; which premiered on Gold.

=== Feature film work ===
Richardson&#x27;s success on the small screen has not always translated well to cinematic releases. &quot;The Supergrass&quot; (1985), was the first feature length theatrical release for a Comic Strip film and was funded through Film4 Productions. Reviews were mixed but mostly favourable and the film has a cult following. Richardson himself expressed the opinion in retrospect that maybe it was too gentle for a Comic Strip film.

Richardson followed this up with the 1987 film &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;, written by himself and Pete Richens, about a waiter at an exclusive restaurant called &quot;Bastard&#x27;s&quot;, who stages a rebellion against the government. Critics were mixed in their opinions on the film. Hal Hinson writing in &quot;the Washington Post&quot; gave the film a lukewarm review and said &quot;The punk jaggedness they bring to their derivations is the only hint of originality, but this, too, seems a little staid. It feels like punk on the downward swing, after most of its rude energy has dissipated.&quot; Vincent Canby in &quot;the New York Times&quot; was more favourable and drew comparisons to &quot;an upscale John Waters satire&quot; and &quot;Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s pre-Maoist period&quot;. In January 1988 the film was one of several attacked in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; by Oxford University historian Norman Stone for their critique of Thatcherite society and values, Stone describing them as &quot;worthless and insulting&quot; and &quot;riddled with left wing bias&quot;.

Richardson ran into controversy with a proposed three part papal satire which he pitched to Channel 4 in 1988. Several British newspapers found that the script was being considered, generating anger amongst the Catholic establishment and after some unfavourable press attention Channel 4 scrapped the project. Shortly after this Richardson moved &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; to the BBC and produced two episodes based on the original trilogy screenplay, although they were much changed. He reworked the remainder of the story and again with backing from Film4 used elements of it to write the 1991 film &quot;The Pope Must Die&quot;, starring Comic Strip regulars Robbie Coltrane and Adrian Edmondson along with Herbert Lom and Paul Bartel. Richardson again directed. The film experienced problems placing advertising in several countries, particularly the US due to its controversial title, received mixed reviews from critics and struggled to make back its £2.5 million budget, grossing $2,544,770 overall (approximately £1.7 million).

Richardson appeared in the 1992 revival of the Carry On franchise, &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot;, alongside other Comic Strip members Rik Mayall, Alexei Sayle and Nigel Planer. The film was badly received, with Time Out London saying, &quot;None of the new crew of Sayle, Richardson, Mayall and Planer is remotely endearing in their awfulness.&quot;

In 2003 Richardson began filming on his return to the big screen, directing Christian Slater and Neve Campbell in &quot;&quot;, which was released in December 2004. The film was a return to the universe of Comic Strip films &quot;The Strike&quot; and &quot;GLC&quot;, where Hollywood remakes and distorts events from British historical events and portrayed Winston Churchill as a gun toting U.S. G.I. similar to Bruce Willis. Philip French writing in &quot;the Observer&quot; called it &quot;a hit and miss affair&quot; Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian gave it three stars and said &quot;It&#x27;s wildly uneven and very broad, but there are some laughs in Peter Richardson&#x27;s Comic Strip fantasy of Churchill&#x27;s real life as a kickass action hero.&quot; However Nev Peirce on the BBC&#x27;s website panned the film, saying &quot;Sadly, Peter Richardson suffers the fate of many satirists; in trying to mock bad films, he&#x27;s simply made a bad film.&quot; The film grossed £148,326 on its opening weekend across 170 screens in the UK
The same year Richardson released a feature-length film of &quot;Stella Street&quot; through his new production company. He co-wrote and directed the film. It received unfavourable reviews. Anita Gates in the New York Times wrote, &quot;The concept doesn&#x27;t translate well to the longer form. The sense of the absurd is watered down&quot;, while Michael Rechtshaffen in the Hollywood Reporter said, &quot;What might have achieved a degree of cult status across the pond when it was aired in 10-minute installments, struggles to pass big-screen scrutiny in a feature-length treatment that hinges on the flimsiest of plot lines.&quot; One reviewer said, &quot;Two people walked out of the screening in the first half hour and the man sitting next to me slept through it&quot;, while Matthew Smith from Film International Journal said, &quot;The story and tone are so confused and the caliber of impersonations so inconsistent, the film will please only the most Anglophilic of audiences.&quot; However Derek Elley in Variety thought it &quot;Manages to sustain its single-joke premise... over feature length.&quot; The film opened in 10 screens in the USA and took $2,574 on the opening weekend.

=== Other television work ===
During the last series of Comic Strip films, Richardson introduced a new group of performers: Doon Mackichan, Mark Caven, Phil Cornwell, Sara Stockbridge, George Yiasoumi and Gary Beadle, and went on to star them in &quot;The Glam Metal Detectives&quot;. The series was a hit with critics, and did well enough in the ratings, but spiralling production costs and internal wranglings at the BBC meant it only ran for one series.

Apart from the Comic Strip, Richardson&#x27;s best-known work is the sitcom &quot;Stella Street&quot;, which he directed and co-wrote with Phil Cornwell and impressionist John Sessions. A &quot;Stella Street&quot; feature film was released in 2004. He also directed the mock documentary &quot;Lust for Glorious&quot; about comedian Eddie Izzard with Mark Caven and Phil Kay.

=== Production work ===
In 2004, Richardson co-founded the production company Great Western Features with Nick Smith, which is based in Totnes, Devon. The company produced &quot;Churchill: The Hollywood Years&quot;, feature film &quot;The Golden Road&quot; and the Comic Strip production &quot;Sex Actually&quot;. They also produced a feature-length film of &quot;Stella Street&quot;, which Richardson also directed. They filmed a new Comic Strip entitled &quot;It Ends Badly&quot; in August 2013. They have also produced commercials for recycling, Flybe, Harris Tweed and the Devon Tourist Board.

==Personal life==
His son Red Richardson is a stand-up comedian.

<doc id="443381" wikidata="Q5445986" url="?curid=443381" title="Fettes College">
<text>Fettes College () is a co-educational private boarding and day school in Craigleith, Edinburgh, Scotland, with over two-thirds of its pupils in residence on campus. The school was originally a boarding school for boys only and became co-ed in 1983. In 1978 the College had a nine-hole golf course, an ice-skating rink used in winter for ice hockey and in summer as an outdoor swimming pool, a cross-country running track and a rifle shooting range within the forested 300-acre grounds. Fettes is sometimes referred to as a public school, although that term was traditionally used in Scotland for state schools.

The school was founded with a bequest of Sir William Fettes in 1870 and started admitting girls in 1970. It follows the English rather than the Scottish education system and has nine houses. The main building, called the Bryce Building, was designed by David Bryce.

The school is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among top 30 senior schools in the UK.

==History==
===Establishment===
To perpetuate the memory of his only son William, who had predeceased him in 1815, Sir William Fettes (1750–1836), a former Lord Provost of Edinburgh and a wealthy city merchant, bequeathed the then very large sum of £166,000 to be set aside for the education of poor children and orphans.

After his death the bequest was invested, and the accumulated sum was then used to acquire the 350 acres of land, to build the main building and to found the school in 1870. Fettes College opened with 53 pupils (40 were Foundation Scholars with 11 others boarding and two day pupils). Following serious fires, the swimming baths were rebuilt in 1890 and the chemistry laboratory was rebuilt in 1897. The cricket pavilion was completed in 1906.

===War years===

In summer 1914 the school&#x27;s summer camp at Barry had to be abandoned when both the commanding officer and the adjutant were called up for service in the First World War. Of the 2,000 former pupils who had by then been educated at the school, 1,094 served in the armed forces, and 246 died during their war service. In 1921 a war memorial designed by Birnie Rhind, bearing the inscription &quot;carry on&quot;, was unveiled by Major-General Sir William Macpherson in the school grounds. A central heating system was first introduced in the main building in 1920, and electric light was first introduced in the school in 1924.

In October 1939, early in the Second World War, the school had its first experience of hostilities when a German Junkers Ju 88 flew low over the school playing fields en route to bomb Rosyth Dockyard. Kimmerghame House was requisitioned for use as a section of the mine research unit HMS &quot;Vernon&quot;. A total of 118 former boys died in the Second World War. In the mid-1940s Sean Connery, a milkman with the St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Co-operative Society, delivered milk to the school in the mornings.

The school chapel was enlarged by adding a chancel and a gallery in 1948. A new school running track was opened in 1954 giving a boost to athletics at the school, and Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the school in 1955.

===Land and admission changes===

In the early 1960s the school was required to sell 18 acres of land to allow Telford College to be built and to sell 14 acres for a new headquarters for Lothian and Borders Police. Following a public inquiry in 1965 the school was also forced to sell 15 acres of land to allow Broughton High School to be re-built. A new dining hall was opened in 1966 and a new school library was opened in 1970. The Queen Mother also opened a new science school in 1970.

An all-boys school until 1970, when female pupils were first admitted for the final year, Fettes became fully co-educational in 1983. In 1988 the school sold 13 acres of land to McCarthy &amp; Stone for residential use for £3million: the proceeds were used by the school to finance the refurbishment of the boys&#x27; houses.

===Recent history===
In the late 1990s the school performed particularly well academically: in 1998 Fettes was placed fourth in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s league table of schools. In 1999 Fettes was placed fifth in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; list of top mixed independent schools in the UK and in 2001 Fettes was declared &quot;Scottish School of the year&quot; by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;.

In March 2009 Fettes won the Scottish Schools U18 Rugby Cup, at Murrayfield Stadium, for the first time and in April 2009 Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) published a report on Fettes that evaluated the school as &quot;excellent&quot; in four out of five Quality Indicators and &quot;very good&quot; in the other.

It is said that Fettes &quot;used to have a hearty, rugger-bugger, Caledonian image&quot;. Some journalists have described Fettes as &quot;the Eton of the North&quot;. Former headmaster Michael Spens jokingly countered on a BBC documentary that &quot;Eton College was the Fettes of the South!&quot;

In 2020 and 2021 six men accused Iain Wares, who had taught at Fettes and Edinburgh Academy, of physical and sexual abuse at the schools when they were pupils in the 1970s. The Scottish Crown Prosecution Service was initially reluctant to prosecute the alleged abuser because of difficulties in seeking his extradition from South Africa—he had moved there—and his advanced age, but South Africa approved the UK&#x27;s extradition request, on six charges of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour and one of indecent assault, in 2020. The lawyer representing Fettes made &quot;a full and unreserved apology&quot; to former pupils who had suffered abuse. The perpetrator admitted the abuse, and was fighting extradition from South Africa to Scotland in 2022, and remained, free, in South Africa . One former pupil was awarded £450,000 in damages in 2022 for abuse suffered at the School.

In 2022 a former pupil, who attended Fettes Junior School and Fettes College as a day student in the 1970s and 1980s, claimed he was abused while at the junior school. Speaking to &quot;Scotland Tonight&quot; the man said he was beaten and sexually abused by a teacher. He claimed he was targeted when he was aged 12 because he was &quot;more developed, and reached puberty before lots of the other boys&quot;. The matter was discussed in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;In Dark Corners&quot; with Alex Renton, which spoke to dozens of former pupils who alleged they were abused by teachers at Fettes College and at Edinburgh Academy. In 2023, the school was featured on the BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary &quot;My Teacher the Abuser: Fighting for Justice&quot;. In the documentary boys spoke of sexual and physical abuse committed by Wares, which the former students claimed was covered up. One former student stated in the documentary that he had contacted the school and they were not interested in helping to locate the teacher. It was also claimed that the school provided an excellent reference for the abusive teacher.

==Overview==
===Curriculum===
Fettes College follows the English rather than the Scottish education system. Pupils take English GCSEs rather than Scottish National Qualifications and students now have the choice between A Levels and the new International Baccalaureate Diploma, but cannot take Scottish exams. Life at Fettes revolves around sports such as rugby, hockey, cricket, golf, tennis, rugby fives, rowing, basketball, rock climbing and squash in the afternoons and the various clubs and societies like shooting, fencing, CCF (Combined Cadet Force), debating society, drama, chess, music society, ceramics, crochet, running, badminton, robotics etc. in the evenings.

Fettes is an IB World School, one of only three schools in Scotland to have this status, the other two being George Watson&#x27;s College (also in Edinburgh) and St Leonards School in St Andrews.

===Boarding houses===

There are currently nine houses: four for boys, four for girls and one for boys and girls. The houses are named after the estates of the first Trustees. The male houses are large period buildings which stretch from East Fettes Avenue to Crewe Road South along Carrington Road; two of the female houses are in the upper floors of the main College Building, the third is in a modern building in the eastern part of the grounds, and the new fourth girls&#x27; house is in the western part of the grounds and was finished in September 2012. The new house was built to reduce the pressure on the three girls&#x27; houses, which were accommodating more pupils than the four boys&#x27; houses. The Upper Sixth Boarding House, for both boys and girls in their last year at Fettes, opened in September 2007.

====Boys====
* Carrington (1872–present)
* Glencorse (1873–present)
* Kimmerghame (1920–present)
* Moredun (1870–present)

====Girls====
* Arniston (1982–present)
* College East (1984–present)
* College West (1984–present)
* Dalmeny (2012–present)

====Boys and girls====
* Craigleith (2007–present)

====History====
* Dalmeny was renamed Carrington in 1873.
* Inverleith was the previous name for the Preparatory School, now a separate entity.
* Dalmeny was the name of the day girls&#x27; boarding house on the ground floor of the west wing in the 1980s.
* Kimmerghame was the name of the junior boarding house between 1884 and 1895.
* Craigleith is a mixed Upper-Sixth Form boarding house established in 2007.

===Architecture===

The college&#x27;s main building, by David Bryce (built 1863-69), blends the design of a Loire château with elements of the 19th-century Scottish Baronial. According to the school&#x27;s website, the combination of styles and the site of the building led a modern architectural expert to praise it as &quot;undeniably one of Scotland&#x27;s greatest buildings&quot;.

The war memorial, a bronze figure of a fallen officer telling his men to &quot;carry on&quot; is by Birnie Rhind, 1919.

===Coat of arms===

The school crest is a bee because it appears at the top of Sir William&#x27;s coat of arms and his seal (for letters, etc.) was also a bee. When the college&#x27;s arms were granted, they were Sir William&#x27;s with the colours reversed. Nowadays a more modern image is used but it is still the same coat of arms. The bee is the origin of the school&#x27;s motto &quot;Industria&quot;. Its motif features prominently around the school. Beehives appear over the now-unused East and West doors of the College. A bee in stone watches over the front of Malcolm House (1880) and the Prep School. A large bee fronts Kimmerghame (1928) and there is an original lead bee in the porch of the Headmaster&#x27;s Lodge.

===Fettes tartan===

A school tartan was designed in 1996 at the prompting of the Headmaster, Malcolm Thyne. It is a balance between the traditional kilt colours of green, blue and black and the Fettes colours of chocolate and magenta, with white stripes to add brightness. The Fettes tartan is worn as a kilt by boys and as a kilt skirt by girls who do not have a family tartan. The first showing of the kilt was on the hockey/lacrosse tour of Australia and Japan in 1998.

==Fettes in fiction==

===&quot;Body Politic&quot;===
In his first crime novel, &quot;Body Politic&quot;, published in 1997, featuring detective Quintilian Dalrymple and set in Edinburgh in 2020, Paul Johnston features Fettes College as a ruin, &quot;blown to pieces in 2009&quot; after it became a base for drug traders.

===James Bond===

While expanding on James Bond&#x27;s back story, Ian Fleming wrote in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; that the agent had attended Fettes College, his father Andrew Bond&#x27;s old school, after having been removed from Eton. An Andrew Bond is recorded to have been at Fettes as a boarder in Carrington House.

&quot;Here the atmosphere was somewhat Calvinistic, and both academic and athletic standards were rigorous. Nevertheless, though inclined to be solitary by nature, he established some firm friendships among the traditionally famous athletic circles, at the school. By the time he left, at the early age of seventeen, he had twice fought for the school as a light-weight and had, in addition, founded the first serious judo class at a British public school.&quot; 
Fleming based his character on Sir Alexander Glen, an old boy of the school who was Winston Churchill&#x27;s envoy to Belgrade during the Second World War.

While Fleming never claimed there was any source for the name of Bond other than James Bond, an American ornithologist, there was a real-life Commander James Bond RNVR who had attended Fettes. He was a frogman with the Special Boat Service, much as the fictional character Bond has a naval background. The school had his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry copied and framed over the Second Master&#x27;s office door in one of its main corridors. This has since been removed.

Several young James Bond stories refer to, or feature, Bond&#x27;s schooling at Fettes. The cover of &quot;This Time We Are All In The Front Line&quot; depicts a young Bond and Housemates leaving Fettes in uniform to rescue survivors of Luftwaffe bombing of Leith Docks in the Second World War.

===Captain Britain===
Later to become Marvel Comics&#x27; Captain Britain, the British equivalent of Captain America, Brian Braddock was born to aristocratic parents in the town of Maldon, Essex. After falling upon hard times, Brian&#x27;s family had lost their place in society, leaving Brian a lonely yet gifted child who immerses himself in the study of Physics.
A prodigious talent, Brian is selected to attend Fettes College where he excels in his studies. Following the death of his parents (Sir James and Lady Elizabeth) in what seemed to be a laboratory accident, Brian accepts a fellowship at Darkmoor nuclear research centre. When the facility is attacked by the Reaver, Brian tries to find help by escaping on his motorcycle. Although he crashes his bike in a nearly fatal accident, Merlyn and his daughter the Omniversal Guardian Roma appear to the badly injured Brian. They give him the chance to be the superhero Captain Britain. He is offered a choice: the Amulet of Right or the Sword of Might. Considering himself to be no warrior and unsuited for the challenge, he rejects the Sword and chooses the Amulet. This choice transforms Brian Braddock into Captain Britain, the champion of the British Isles.

=== Sloane Ranger ===
This iconic 1982 guide to the British upper classes, also known as &quot;Sloane Rangers&quot;, described Fettes College as a &quot;First XI&quot; public school.

<text>Aulopiformes is a diverse order of marine ray-finned fish consisting of some 15 extant and several prehistoric families with about 45 genera and over 230 species. The common names grinners, lizardfishes and allies, or aulopiforms are sometimes used for this group. The scientific name means &quot;&quot;Aulopus&quot;-shaped&quot;, from &quot;Aulopus&quot; (the type genus) + the standard fish order suffix &quot;-formes&quot;. It ultimately derives from Ancient Greek &quot;aulós&quot; (αὐλός, &quot;flute&quot; or &quot;pipe&quot;) + Latin &quot;forma&quot; (&quot;external form&quot;), the former in reference to the elongated shape of many aulopiforms.

They are grouped together because of common features in the structure of their gill arches. Indeed, many authors have considered them so distinct as to warrant separation in a monotypic superorder of the Teleostei, under the name Cyclosquamata. However, monotypic taxa are generally avoided by modern taxonomists if not necessary, and in this case a distinct superorder seems indeed unwarranted: together with the equally dubious superorder &quot;Stenopterygii&quot;, the grinners appear to be so closely related to some Protacanthopterygii to be included in that superorder. In particular, this group might be the sister taxon of the Salmoniformes (salmon, trout, and relatives). As an alternative, the superorders are sometimes united as an unranked clade named Euteleostei, but in that case the Protacanthopterygii would need to be split further to account for the phylogenetic uncertainty. This would result in a highly cumbersome and taxonomically redundant group of two very small and no less than four monotypic superorders.

An extinct clade of Aulopiformes, the suborder Enchodontoidei and its many constituent families, were dominant nektonic fish throughout much of the Late Cretaceous. Several other extant aulopiform families also have Cretaceous representatives, and phylogenetic evidence indicates that the order as a whole diversified into its extant families around the Early Cretaceous, making it rather ancient. These diversifications included the earliest adaptations for deep-sea living, which is common among many extant aulopiform taxa.

==Description==
Many aulopiforms are deep-sea fishes, with some species recognized as being hermaphrodites, some with the ability to self-fertilise. Some are benthic, but most are pelagic nekton. In general, aulopiform fish have a mixture of advanced and primitive characteristics relative to other teleost fish.
Aulopiforms have either a vestigial gas bladder, or lack it entirely, a hypaxialis muscle that is unusually extended to forward at its upper end and attaches to the neurocranium below the spine (perhaps to snap the upper part of the skull down when catching prey) and the position of the maxillary bone. Their second pharyngobranchial is greatly elongated posterolaterally away from third pharyngobranchial, which lacks a cartilaginous condyle to articulate with the preceding, but is contacted by the elongated uncinate process of the second epibranchial. Other features include the position of the pelvic fins far back on the body, the fused medial processes of pelvic girdle, and the presence of an adipose fin (which is also typical for the Protacanthopterygii).

The larvae of some Aulopiformes are extremely bizarre-looking, with elongated fins, and do not resemble the adult animals. They were not only described as distinct species, but also even separated as genera and finally in a family &quot;Macristiidae&quot; which was allied with various Protacanthopterygii (&quot;sensu lato&quot;), but the initial assessment – which found &quot;Macristium&quot; to resemble the deepwater lizardfishes (Bathysauridae) in some details – was not far off the mark: &quot;Macristium&quot; species are larvae of &quot;Bathysaurus&quot;, while the supposed other &quot;macristiids&quot;, &quot;Macristiella&quot; species are larvae of the deepsea tripodfish &quot;Bathytyphlops&quot;.

<text>Blyth Valley was a local government district with borough status in south-east Northumberland, England, bordering the North Sea and Tyne and Wear. The two principal towns were Blyth and Cramlington. Other population centres include Seaton Delaval, and Seaton Sluice.

The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the borough of Blyth, part of Seaton Valley urban district and part of the borough of Whitley Bay.

The district council was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England effective from 1 April 2009 with responsibilities being transferred to Northumberland County Council, a unitary authority.

<doc id="443387" wikidata="Q2326800" url="?curid=443387" title="Simple ring">
<text>In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a simple ring is a non-zero ring that has no two-sided ideal besides the zero ideal and itself. In particular, a commutative ring is a simple ring if and only if it is a field.

The center of a simple ring is necessarily a field. It follows that a simple ring is an associative algebra over this field. It is then called a simple algebra over this field.

Several references (e.g., or ) require in addition that a simple ring be left or right Artinian (or equivalently semi-simple). Under such terminology a non-zero ring with no non-trivial two-sided ideals is called quasi-simple.

Rings which are simple as rings but are not a simple module over themselves do exist: a full matrix ring over a field does not have any nontrivial two-sided ideals (since any ideal of formula_1 is of the form formula_2 with formula_3 an ideal of formula_4), but it has nontrivial left ideals (for example, the sets of matrices which have some fixed zero columns).

An immediate example of a simple ring is a division ring, where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, for instance, the quaternions. Also, for any formula_5, the algebra of formula_6 matrices with entries in a division ring is simple.

Joseph Wedderburn proved that if a ring formula_4 is a finite-dimensional simple algebra over a field formula_8, it is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over some division algebra over formula_8. In particular, the only simple rings that are finite-dimensional algebras over the real numbers are rings of matrices over either the real numbers, the complex numbers, or the quaternions.

Wedderburn proved these results in 1907 in his doctoral thesis, &quot;On hypercomplex numbers&quot;, which appeared in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. His thesis classified finite-dimensional simple and also semisimple algebras over fields. Simple algebras are building blocks of semisimple algebras: any finite-dimensional semisimple algebra is a Cartesian product, in the sense of algebras, of finite-dimensional simple algebras.

One must be careful of the terminology: not every simple ring is a semisimple ring, and not every simple algebra is a semisimple algebra. However, every finite-dimensional simple algebra is a semisimple algebra, and every simple ring that is left- or right-artinian is a semisimple ring.

An example of a simple ring that is not semisimple is the Weyl algebra. The Weyl algebra also gives an example of a simple algebra that is not a matrix algebra over a division algebra over its center: the Weyl algebra is infinite-dimensional, so Wedderburn&#x27;s theorem does not apply.

Wedderburn&#x27;s result was later generalized to semisimple rings in the Wedderburn–Artin theorem: this says that every semisimple ring is a finite product of matrix rings over division rings. As a consequence of this generalization, every simple ring that is left- or right-artinian is a matrix ring over a division ring.

== Examples ==
Let formula_10 be the field of real numbers, formula_11 be the field of complex numbers, and formula_12 the quaternions.
* A central simple algebra (sometimes called a Brauer algebra) is a simple finite-dimensional algebra over a field formula_13 whose center is formula_13.
* Every finite-dimensional simple algebra over formula_10 is isomorphic to an algebra of formula_6 matrices with entries in formula_10, formula_11, or formula_12. Every central simple algebra over formula_10 is isomorphic to an algebra of formula_6 matrices with entries formula_10 or formula_12. These results follow from the Frobenius theorem.
* Every finite-dimensional simple algebra over formula_11 is a central simple algebra, and is isomorphic to a matrix ring over formula_11.
* Every finite-dimensional central simple algebra over a finite field is isomorphic to a matrix ring over that field.
* The algebra of all linear transformations of an infinite-dimensional vector space over a field formula_8 is a simple ring that is not a semisimple ring. It is also a simple algebra over formula_8 that is not a semisimple algebra.

<doc id="443392" wikidata="Q751884" url="?curid=443392" title="Vihuela">
<text>The vihuela () is a 15th-century fretted plucked Spanish string instrument, shaped like a guitar (figure-of-eight form offering strength and portability) but tuned like a lute. It was used in 15th- and 16th-century Spain as the equivalent of the lute in Italy and has a large resultant repertory. There were usually five or six doubled strings.

A bowed version, the vihuela de arco (arco meaning bow), was conceived in Spain and made in Italy from 1480. One consequence was the phrase vihuela de mano being thereafter applied to the original plucked instrument. The term &quot;vihuela&quot; became &quot;viola&quot; in Italian (&quot;viole&quot; in Fr.; &quot;viol&quot; in Eng.), and the bowed vihuela de arco was to serve as a prototype in the hands of the Italian craftsmen for the &quot;da gamba&quot; family of fretted bowed string instruments, as developed starting in 1480. Their vihuela-inherited frets made these easier to play in tune than the rebec family (precursors of the &quot;da braccio&quot; family), and so they became popular for chamber music.

== History ==

The &quot;vihuela&quot;, as it was known in Spanish, was called the &quot;viola de mà&quot; in Catalan, &quot;viola da mano&quot; in Italian and &quot;viola de mão&quot; in Portuguese. The two names are functionally synonymous and interchangeable. In its most developed form, the vihuela was a guitar-shaped instrument with six double-strings (paired courses) made of gut. Vihuelas were tuned identically to their contemporary Renaissance lute; 4ths and one major 3rd (44344, almost like a modern guitar tuning, with the exception of the third string, which was tuned a semitone lower).

Plucked vihuelas, being essentially flat-backed lutes, evolved in the mid-15th century, in the Kingdom of Aragón, located in north-eastern Iberia (Spain). In Spain, Portugal, and Italy the vihuela was in common use by the late 15th through to the late 16th centuries. In the second half of the 15th century, some vihuela players began using a bow, leading to the development of the viol.

There were several different types of vihuela (or different playing methods at least):
*Vihuela de mano: 6 or 5 courses played with the fingers
*Vihuela de penola: played with a plectrum
*Vihuela de arco: played with a bow (ancestor of the viola da gamba)

Tunings for 6 course vihuela de mano (44344): 
* G C F A D G 
* C F B D G C

Although mainstream use of the vihuela has faded away, traces of the complex polyphonic music that was its repertoire in the late 16th century, along with the other primary instrument of the Spanish and Portuguese Renaissance, the cross-strung harp, both of which can be heard in Mexican Mariachi music. The vihuela&#x27;s descendants that are still played are the &quot;violas campaniças&quot; of Portugal. Much of the vihuela&#x27;s place, role, and function was taken up by the subsequent Baroque guitar (also sometimes referred to as vihuela or bigüela). Currently, the vihuela is in widespread use in Mexican Mariachi music, where its distinctive sound is featured in solos. Additionally, the vihuela is used for the performance of early music, using modern replicas of historical instruments. Today, instruments like the tiple are descendants of vihuelas brought to America in the 16th century.

== Construction ==

Vihuela bodies were lightly constructed from thin flat slabs or pieces of wood, bent or curved as required. This construction method distinguished them from some earlier types of string instruments whose bodies (if not the entire instrument including the neck) were carved out from a solid single block of wood. The back and sides of common lutes were also made &quot;of pieces&quot; however, being multiple curved or bent &quot;staves&quot; joined and glued together to form a bowl, made from cypress with a spruce or cedar top.

Vihuela (and violas da gamba) were built in different sizes, large and small, a family of instruments. Duet music was published for vihuelas tuned one step, a minor third, a fourth, or a fifth apart, as well as unison tuned.

The physical appearance of vihuelas was varied and diverse; there was little standardization and no mass production. Overall and in general, vihuelas looked very similar to modern guitars. The first generation of vihuela, from the mid-15th century on, had sharp cuts to its waist, similar to that of a violin. A second generation of vihuela, beginning sometime around 1490, took on the now-familiar smooth-curved figure-eight shaped body contours. The sharp waist-cut models continued to be built into the early-to-mid-16th century, side by side with the later pattern. Many early vihuelas had extremely long necks, while others had the shorter variety. Top decoration, the number, shape, and placement, of sound holes, ports, pierced rosettes, etc., also varied greatly. More than a few styles of peg-boxes were used as well.

Vihuelas were chromatically fretted in a manner similar to lutes, by means of movable, wrapped-around and tied-on gut frets. Vihuelas, however, usually had ten frets, whereas lutes had only seven. Unlike modern guitars, which often use steel and bronze strings, vihuelas were gut strung, and usually in paired courses. Gut strings produce a sonority far different from metal, generally described as softer and sweeter. A six course vihuela could be strung in either of two ways: with 12 strings in 6 pairs, or 11 strings in total if a single unpaired &quot;chanterelle&quot; is used on the first (or highest pitched) course. Unpaired chanterelles were common on all lutes, vihuelas, and (other) early guitars (both Renaissance guitars and Baroque guitars).

== Repertoire ==

The first person to publish a collection of music for the vihuela was the Spanish composer Luis de Milán, with his volume titled &quot;Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El maestro&quot; of 1536 dedicated to King John III of Portugal. The notational device used throughout this and other vihuela music books is a numeric tablature (otherwise called &quot;lute tablature&quot;), which is also the model from which modern &quot;guitar tab&quot; was fashioned. The music is easily performed by retuning to Classic lute and vihuela tuning (44344). The tablature system used in all these texts is the &quot;Italian&quot; tablature, wherein the stopped frets are indicated by numbers and the lowest line of the staff represents the highest-pitch course (or string), resembling the neck of the instrument in playing position; Milán&#x27;s book also uses numbers to indicate the stopping of the courses but exceptionally it is the top line of the staff that represents the highest-pitch course, as in &quot;French&quot; tablature.

The printed books of music for the vihuela which have survived are, in chronological order: 
* &quot;El Maestro&quot; by Luis de Milán (1536)
* &quot;Los seys libros del Delphin&quot; by Luis de Narváez (1538) 
* &quot;Tres Libros de Música&quot; by Alonso Mudarra (1546) 
* &quot;Silva de Sirenas&quot; by Enríquez de Valderrábano (1547) 
* &quot;Libro de Música de Vihuela&quot; by Diego Pisador (1552) 
* &quot;Orphénica Lyra&quot; by Miguel de Fuenllana (1554) 
* &quot;El Parnasso&quot; by Estevan Daça (1576)

== Surviving instruments ==
There are three surviving historic vihuelas:
* The &#x27;Guadalupe&#x27; vihuela in the Musée Jacquemart-André
* The &#x27;Chambure&#x27; instrument in the Cité de la Musique
* A relic of Saint Mariana de Jesús (1618–1645), kept in the Iglesia de la Compañia de Jesús de Quito.

Modern versions of the vihuela continue to be made. Performers adept with the vihuela include the Scottish composer Robert MacKillop, English lutenist Julian Bream and the American artist Hopkinson Smith.

<text>Wansbeck was a local government district in south-east Northumberland, England. Its main population centres were Ashington, Bedlington and Newbiggin-by-the-Sea.

The area which was bounded by the district is mostly urban, on the North Sea coast north of the Tyneside conurbation. It bordered Blyth Valley district to the south, the border being the River Blyth. It was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the urban districts of Ashington, Bedlingtonshire and Newbiggin-by-the-Sea. It is named after the River Wansbeck.

The district council was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England effective from 1 April 2009 with responsibilities being transferred to Northumberland County Council, a unitary authority.

<text>Tynedale was a local government district in Northumberland, England. The district had a resident population of 58,808 according to the 2001 census. The main towns were Hexham, Haltwhistle and Prudhoe. The district contained part of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the southern part of Northumberland National Park.

With an area of it was the second-largest English district, after the East Riding of Yorkshire. It was bigger than several English counties, including Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Hertfordshire. It was also the second-least densely populated district (behind Eden, Cumbria). The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, and was a merger of Hexham and Prudhoe urban districts, along with Bellingham, Haltwhistle and Hexham rural districts.

Tynedale was historically a liberty created alongside the county of Hexhamshire by Henry I of England.

The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England effective from 1 April 2009 with responsibilities being transferred to Northumberland County Council, a unitary authority. However, the name &quot;Tynedale&quot;, which predates the formation of the council, is still widely used for the Tyne Valley area of Northumberland. Since then, Northumberland County Council has had a Tynedale area committee covering the area.

<doc id="443406" wikidata="Q7350708" url="?curid=443406" title="Robert W. McChesney">
<text>Robert Waterman McChesney (; born December 22, 1952) is an American professor notable in the history and political economy of communications, and the role media play in democratic and capitalist societies. He is the Gutgsell Endowed Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. He co-founded the Free Press, a national media reform organization. From 2002 to 2012, he hosted &quot;Media Matters&quot;, a weekly radio program every Sunday afternoon on WILL (AM), Illinois Public Media radio.

==Background and education==
McChesney was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Samuel Parker McChesney, an advertising salesman for &quot;This Week&quot; magazine, and his wife Edna Margaret &quot;Meg&quot; (née McCorkle) McChesney, a nurse. He attended The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, where he studied history and political economy.

==Career==
After college, McChesney worked for a time as a sports stringer for United Press International (UPI) and published a weekly newspaper. In 1979 he was the founding publisher of &quot;The Rocket&quot;, a Seattle-based rock music magazine that chronicled the birth of the Seattle rock scene of the late 1980s and 1990s.

He gradually began to report on the media itself and became an expert in the field, entering academic studies in this area. He did graduate work at the University of Washington, obtaining a PhD in Communications there in 1989. McChesney has published several books about the media, politics and contemporary United States society. (See below).

He is the Gutgsell Endowed Professor in the Department of Communication of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

==Assessment of the media==

McChesney has said the term &quot;deregulated media&quot; is a misnomer. He describes media organizations as a government-sanctioned oligopoly, owned by a few highly profitable corporate entities. They have legislative influence and control news coverage and can distort public understanding of media issues.

In his article &quot;Farewell To Journalism&quot; (October 2012), McChesney described what he considered the deterioration of the current US media system; he said that this freefall threatens the democratic system itself. He highlights what scholars believe to be the key characteristics of healthy journalism, and says, &quot;It is necessary...that the media system as a whole makes such journalism a realistic expectation for the citizenry.&quot;

McChesney proposed a $200 annual Citizenship News Voucher to support journalism.

<doc id="443413" wikidata="Q2734833" url="?curid=443413" title="Easington, County Durham">
<text>Easington, also known as Easington Village, is a village and civil parish in eastern County Durham, England. It is located at the junction of the A182 and B1283, leading north-west to Hetton-le-Hole and south east to Horden.

It is near the A19, which travels north to Seaham and Sunderland as well as south to Peterlee and Stockton-on-Tees. The population of Easington Village was 2,164 in 2001, increasing slightly to 2,171 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

There is evidence of Easington having been an important pre-Norman Conquest site, including architectural fragments (dating from as early as the 8th century) found within the fabric of St Mary&#x27;s Church. St Mary&#x27;s itself is mostly 12th–13th century, and contains a notable amount of seventeenth-century woodwork. From 1256 until 1832 the Rector of Easington was also Archdeacon of Durham.

One of the most prominent events in the long history of the village was the hanging of two men on the village green for involvement in the plot to replace Tudor monarch Queen Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. Pope Adrian IV (c. 1100–1 September 1159), born Nicholas Breakspear, lived here for a time. The village is also known as the setting of the folktale, &quot;The Legend of the Easington hare&quot;.

The village is home to one of the few remaining 13th-century domestic buildings (open-hall) in the country, Seaton Holme. It became an archdeacon&#x27;s residence, served as the rectory until around 1960 and was a children&#x27;s home for a time before falling into disrepair. In 1992 it was finally restored to a semblance of its former stature.

===Overshadowed===
The sinking of coal mines near the village began on 11 April 1899. The settlement of Easington Colliery developed around the colliery. The settlements along the B1283 road has resulted in both settlements merging. However, the two places have retained their distinctive characters and continue to reflect different trends. Easington Colliery was the last pit to close on the Durham Coalfields in 1993, with the loss of 1,400 jobs.

==Amenities==
There were two post offices in Easington. The one in the town serves the top of Easington, the middle post office serves the area which is predominantly council properties, and the lower post office served the colliery housing area. This post office closed on 10 October 2008 after being cut in the closure scheme by the Post Office. Easington Academy is located in the village. It acts as the main secondary school for the village and surrounding area.

==Demography==
Easington is notable for being the town with the highest percentage of white residents in England (99.2% white in 2001). According to the results of the 2001 census, it also has the UK&#x27;s lowest population of Jedi knights.

== Notable people ==
*Matt Baker – television presenter (&quot;Blue Peter&quot;, &quot;Countryfile&quot;, &quot;The One Show&quot;)
*Dennis Donnini – VC recipient
*Steve Harper – Newcastle United goalkeeper
*Rachel Howard – artist
*Jez Lowe – folksinger and songwriter
*Kevin Scott – Newcastle United footballer
*Tom Simpson – champion cyclist
*Adam Johnson – Sunderland footballer
*Alan Tate – Swansea City footballer
*James Isaacson – Newcastle Falcons rugby player
*Ian Cranson – Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City footballer.

== In popular culture ==
The film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, set in the fictional County Durham town of Everington, was mainly shot in Easington, though the filmmakers had to go a long way north to Ellington to find the only working mine in the North East. The subsequent stage musical version specifically identifies Easington as its location.

Easington was one of the locations the Ken Loach directed film The Old Oak was filmed.

<doc id="443415" wikidata="Q1095492" url="?curid=443415" title="Parallelogram of force">
<text>The parallelogram of forces is a method for solving (or visualizing) the results of applying two forces to an object.
When more than two forces are involved, the geometry is no longer a parallelogram, but the same principles apply to a &quot;polygon of forces&quot;. 
The resultant force due to the application of a number of forces can be found geometrically by drawing arrows for each force.
The parallelogram of forces is a graphical manifestation of the addition of vectors.

== Newton&#x27;s proof ==
=== Preliminary: the parallelogram of velocity ===
Suppose a particle moves at a uniform rate along a line from A to B (Figure 2) in a given time (say, one second), while in the same time, the line AB moves uniformly from its position at AB to a position at DC, remaining parallel to its original orientation throughout. Accounting for both motions, the particle traces the line AC. Because a displacement in a given time is a measure of velocity, the length of AB is a measure of the particle&#x27;s velocity along AB, the length of AD is a measure of the line&#x27;s velocity along AD, and the length of AC is a measure of the particle&#x27;s velocity along AC. The particle&#x27;s motion is the same as if it had moved with a single velocity along AC.

=== Newton&#x27;s proof of the parallelogram of force ===
Suppose two forces act on a particle at the origin (the &quot;tails&quot; of the vectors) of Figure 1. Let the lengths of the vectors F1 and F2 represent the velocities the two forces could produce in the particle by acting for a given time, and let the direction of each represent the direction in which they act. Each force acts independently and will produce its particular velocity whether the other force acts or not. At the end of the given time, the particle has &quot;both&quot; velocities. By the above proof, they are equivalent to a single velocity, Fnet. By Newton&#x27;s second law, this vector is also a measure of the force which would produce that velocity, thus the two forces are equivalent to a single force.

== Bernoulli&#x27;s proof for perpendicular vectors==

We model forces as Euclidean vectors or members of formula_1. Our first assumption is that the resultant of two forces is in fact another force, so that for any two forces formula_2 there is another force formula_3.

Our final assumption is that the resultant of two forces doesn&#x27;t change when rotated. If formula_4 is any rotation (any orthogonal map for the usual vector space structure of formula_1 with formula_6), then for all forces formula_7

formula_8

Consider two perpendicular forces formula_9 of length formula_10 and formula_11 of length formula_12, with formula_13 being the length of formula_14.
Let formula_15 and formula_16, where formula_17 is the rotation between formula_9 and formula_14, so formula_20. Under the invariance of the rotation, we get

formula_21

Similarly, consider two more forces formula_22 and formula_23. Let formula_24 be the rotation from formula_9 to formula_26: formula_27, which by inspection makes formula_28.

formula_29

Applying these two equations

formula_30

Since formula_31 and formula_32 both lie along formula_14, their lengths are equal formula_34

formula_35

which implies that formula_36 has length formula_37, which is the length of formula_38. Thus for the case where formula_9 and formula_11 are perpendicular, formula_41. However, when combining our two sets of auxiliary forces we used the associativity of formula_42. Using this additional assumption, we will form an additional proof below.
==Algebraic proof of the parallelogram of force==
We model forces as Euclidean vectors or members of formula_1. Our first assumption is that the resultant of two forces is in fact another force, so that for any two forces formula_2 there is another force formula_3. We assume commutativity, as these are forces being applied concurrently, so the order shouldn&#x27;t matter formula_46.

Consider the map
formula_47

If formula_42 is associative, then this map will be linear. Since it also sends formula_49 to formula_49 and formula_51 to formula_51, it must also be the identity map. Thus formula_42 must be equivalent to the normal vector addition operator.

==Controversy==

The mathematical proof of the parallelogram of force is not generally accepted to be mathematically valid. Various proofs were developed (chiefly &quot;Duchayla&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Poisson&#x27;s&quot;), and these also caused objections. That the parallelogram of force was true was not questioned, but &quot;why&quot; it was true. Today the parallelogram of force is accepted as an empirical fact, non-reducible to Newton&#x27;s first principles.

<doc id="443416" wikidata="Q107647" url="?curid=443416" title="Phagocyte">
<text>Phagocytes are cells that protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells. Their name comes from the Greek &quot;&quot;, &quot;to eat&quot; or &quot;devour&quot;, and &quot;-cyte&quot;, the suffix in biology denoting &quot;cell&quot;, from the Greek &quot;kutos,&quot; &quot;hollow vessel&quot;. They are essential for fighting infections and for subsequent immunity. Phagocytes are important throughout the animal kingdom and are highly developed within vertebrates. One litre of human blood contains about six billion phagocytes. They were discovered in 1882 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov while he was studying starfish larvae. Mechnikov was awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery. Phagocytes occur in many species; some amoebae behave like macrophage phagocytes, which suggests that phagocytes appeared early in the evolution of life.

Phagocytes of humans and other animals are called &quot;professional&quot; or &quot;non-professional&quot; depending on how effective they are at phagocytosis. The professional phagocytes include many types of white blood cells (such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and dendritic cells). The main difference between professional and non-professional phagocytes is that the professional phagocytes have molecules called receptors on their surfaces that can detect harmful objects, such as bacteria, that are not normally found in the body. Non-professional phagocytes do not have efficient phagocytic receptors, such as those for opsonins. Phagocytes are crucial in fighting infections, as well as in maintaining healthy tissues by removing dead and dying cells that have reached the end of their lifespan.

During an infection, chemical signals attract phagocytes to places where the pathogen has invaded the body. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes already present. The phagocytes move by a method called chemotaxis. When phagocytes come into contact with bacteria, the receptors on the phagocyte&#x27;s surface will bind to them. This binding will lead to the engulfing of the bacteria by the phagocyte. Some phagocytes kill the ingested pathogen with oxidants and nitric oxide. After phagocytosis, macrophages and dendritic cells can also participate in antigen presentation, a process in which a phagocyte moves parts of the ingested material back to its surface. This material is then displayed to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then travel to the body&#x27;s lymph nodes and display the material to white blood cells called lymphocytes. This process is important in building immunity, and many pathogens have evolved methods to evade attacks by phagocytes.

== History ==

The Russian zoologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (1845–1916) first recognized that specialized cells were involved in defense against microbial infections. In 1882, he studied motile (freely moving) cells in the larvae of starfishes, believing they were important to the animals&#x27; immune defenses. To test his idea, he inserted small thorns from a tangerine tree into the larvae. After a few hours, he noticed that the motile cells had surrounded the thorns. Mechnikov traveled to Vienna and shared his ideas with Carl Friedrich Claus who suggested the name &quot;phagocyte&quot; (from the Greek words &#x27;, meaning &quot;to eat or devour&quot;, and &#x27;, meaning &quot;hollow vessel&quot;) for the cells that Mechnikov had observed.

A year later, Mechnikov studied a fresh water crustacean called &quot;Daphnia&quot;, a tiny transparent animal that can be examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.

In 1903, Almroth Wright discovered that phagocytosis was reinforced by specific antibodies that he called opsonins, from the Greek &quot;opson&quot;, &quot;a dressing or relish&quot;. Mechnikov was awarded (jointly with Paul Ehrlich) the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on phagocytes and phagocytosis.

Although the importance of these discoveries slowly gained acceptance during the early twentieth century, the intricate relationships between phagocytes and all the other components of the immune system were not known until the 1980s.

== Phagocytosis ==
Phagocytosis is the process of taking in particles such as bacteria, invasive fungi, parasites, dead host cells, and cellular and foreign debris by a cell. It involves a chain of molecular processes. Phagocytosis occurs after the foreign body, a bacterial cell, for example, has bound to molecules called &quot;receptors&quot; that are on the surface of the phagocyte. The phagocyte then stretches itself around the bacterium and engulfs it. Phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils takes on average nine minutes. Once inside this phagocyte, the bacterium is trapped in a compartment called a phagosome. Within one minute the phagosome merges with either a lysosome or a granule to form a phagolysosome. The bacterium is then subjected to an overwhelming array of killing mechanisms and is dead a few minutes later. Dendritic cells and macrophages are not so fast, and phagocytosis can take many hours in these cells. Macrophages are slow and untidy eaters; they engulf huge quantities of material and frequently release some undigested back into the tissues. This debris serves as a signal to recruit more phagocytes from the blood. Phagocytes have voracious appetites; scientists have even fed macrophages with iron filings and then used a small magnet to separate them from other cells.

A phagocyte has many types of receptors on its surface that are used to bind material. They include opsonin receptors, scavenger receptors, and Toll-like receptors. Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies or with complement. &quot;Complement&quot; is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction. Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and Toll-like receptors—so called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the Toll gene—bind to more specific molecules including foreign DNA and RNA. Binding to Toll-like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause inflammation.

== Methods of killing ==

The killing of microbes is a critical function of phagocytes that is performed either within the phagocyte (intracellular killing) or outside of the phagocyte (extracellular killing). 

=== Oxygen-dependent intracellular ===
When a phagocyte ingests bacteria (or any material), its oxygen consumption increases. The increase in oxygen consumption, called a respiratory burst, produces reactive oxygen-containing molecules that are anti-microbial. The oxygen compounds are toxic to both the invader and the cell itself, so they are kept in compartments inside the cell. This method of killing invading microbes by using the reactive oxygen-containing molecules is referred to as oxygen-dependent intracellular killing, of which there are two types.

The first type is the oxygen-dependent production of a superoxide, which is an oxygen-rich bacteria-killing substance. The superoxide is converted to hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen by an enzyme called superoxide dismutase. Superoxides also react with the hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals, which assist in killing the invading microbe.

The second type involves the use of the enzyme myeloperoxidase from neutrophil granules. When granules fuse with a phagosome, myeloperoxidase is released into the phagolysosome, and this enzyme uses hydrogen peroxide and chlorine to create hypochlorite, a substance used in domestic bleach. Hypochlorite is extremely toxic to bacteria. Myeloperoxidase contains a heme pigment, which accounts for the green color of secretions rich in neutrophils, such as pus and infected sputum.

=== Oxygen-independent intracellular ===
Phagocytes can also kill microbes by oxygen-independent methods, but these are not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium&#x27;s membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.

=== Extracellular ===
Interferon-gamma—which was once called macrophage activating factor—stimulates macrophages to produce nitric oxide. The source of interferon-gamma can be CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, natural killer T cells, monocytes, other macrophages, or dendritic cells. Nitric oxide is then released from the macrophage and, because of its toxicity, kills microbes near the macrophage. Activated macrophages produce and secrete tumor necrosis factor. This cytokine—a class of signaling molecule—kills cancer cells and cells infected by viruses, and helps to activate the other cells of the immune system.

In some diseases, e.g., the rare chronic granulomatous disease, the efficiency of phagocytes is impaired, and recurrent bacterial infections are a problem. In this disease there is an abnormality affecting different elements of oxygen-dependent killing. Other rare congenital abnormalities, such as Chédiak–Higashi syndrome, are also associated with defective killing of ingested microbes.

=== Viruses ===
Viruses can reproduce only inside cells, and they can gain entry by using many of the receptors involved in immunity. Once inside the cell, viruses use the cell&#x27;s biological machinery to their own advantage, forcing the cell to make hundreds of identical copies of themselves. Although phagocytes and other components of the innate immune system can, to a limited extent, control viruses, once a virus is inside a cell the adaptive immune responses, particularly the lymphocytes, are more important for defense. At the sites of viral infections, lymphocytes often vastly outnumber all the other cells of the immune system; this is common in viral meningitis. Virus-infected cells that have been killed by lymphocytes are cleared from the body by phagocytes.

== Role in apoptosis ==

In an animal, cells are constantly dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps the number of cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes play a crucial role in this process.

Dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display molecules, such as phosphatidylserine, on their cell surface to attract phagocytes. Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a protein known as scramblase. These molecules mark the cell for phagocytosis by cells that possess the appropriate receptors, such as macrophages. The removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an inflammatory response and is an important function of phagocytes.

== Interactions with other cells ==
Phagocytes are usually not bound to any particular organ but move through the body interacting with the other phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells of the immune system. They can communicate with other cells by producing chemicals called cytokines, which recruit other phagocytes to the site of infections or stimulate dormant lymphocytes. Phagocytes form part of the innate immune system, which animals, including humans, are born with. Innate immunity is very effective but non-specific in that it does not discriminate between different sorts of invaders. On the other hand, the adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates—the basis of acquired immunity—is highly specialized and can protect against almost any type of invader. The adaptive immune system is not dependent on phagocytes but lymphocytes, which produce protective proteins called antibodies, which tag invaders for destruction and prevent viruses from infecting cells. Phagocytes, in particular dendritic cells and macrophages, stimulate lymphocytes to produce antibodies by an important process called antigen presentation.

=== Antigen presentation ===
Antigen presentation is a process in which some phagocytes move parts of engulfed materials back to the surface of their cells and &quot;present&quot; them to other cells of the immune system. There are two &quot;professional&quot; antigen-presenting cells: macrophages and dendritic cells. After engulfment, foreign proteins (the antigens) are broken down into peptides inside dendritic cells and macrophages. These peptides are then bound to the cell&#x27;s major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins, which carry the peptides back to the phagocyte&#x27;s surface where they can be &quot;presented&quot; to lymphocytes. Mature macrophages do not travel far from the site of infection, but dendritic cells can reach the body&#x27;s lymph nodes, where there are millions of lymphocytes. This enhances immunity because the lymphocytes respond to the antigens presented by the dendritic cells just as they would at the site of the original infection. But dendritic cells can also destroy or pacify lymphocytes if they recognize components of the host body; this is necessary to prevent autoimmune reactions. This process is called tolerance.

=== Immunological tolerance ===

Dendritic cells also promote immunological tolerance, which stops the body from attacking itself. The first type of tolerance is central tolerance, that occurs in the thymus. T cells that bind (via their T cell receptor) to self antigen (presented by dendritic cells on MHC molecules) too strongly are induced to die. The second type of immunological tolerance is peripheral tolerance. 
Some self reactive T cells escape the thymus for a number of reasons, mainly due to the lack of expression of some self antigens in the thymus. Another type of T cell; T regulatory cells can down regulate self reactive T cells in the periphery. When immunological tolerance fails, autoimmune diseases can follow.

== Professional phagocytes ==

Phagocytes of humans and other jawed vertebrates are divided into &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;non-professional&quot; groups based on the efficiency with which they participate in phagocytosis. The professional phagocytes are myeloid cells, which includes monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, tissue dendritic cells and mast cells. One litre of human blood contains about six billion phagocytes.

=== Activation ===
All phagocytes, and especially macrophages, exist in degrees of readiness. Macrophages are usually relatively dormant in the tissues and proliferate slowly. In this semi-resting state, they clear away dead host cells and other non-infectious debris and rarely take part in antigen presentation. But, during an infection, they receive chemical signals—usually interferon gamma—which increases their production of MHC II molecules and which prepares them for presenting antigens. In this state, macrophages are good antigen presenters and killers. If they receive a signal directly from an invader, they become &quot;hyperactivated&quot;, stop proliferating, and concentrate on killing. Their size and rate of phagocytosis increases—some become large enough to engulf invading protozoa.

In the blood, neutrophils are inactive but are swept along at high speed. When they receive signals from macrophages at the sites of inflammation, they slow down and leave the blood. In the tissues, they are activated by cytokines and arrive at the battle scene ready to kill.

=== Migration ===

When an infection occurs, a chemical &quot;SOS&quot; signal is given off to attract phagocytes to the site. These chemical signals may include proteins from invading bacteria, clotting system peptides, complement products, and cytokines that have been given off by macrophages located in the tissue near the infection site. Another group of chemical attractants are cytokines that recruit neutrophils and monocytes from the blood.

To reach the site of infection, phagocytes leave the bloodstream and enter the affected tissues. Signals from the infection cause the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels to make a protein called selectin, which neutrophils stick to on passing by. Other signals called vasodilators loosen the junctions connecting endothelial cells, allowing the phagocytes to pass through the wall. Chemotaxis is the process by which phagocytes follow the cytokine &quot;scent&quot; to the infected spot. Neutrophils travel across epithelial cell-lined organs to sites of infection, and although this is an important component of fighting infection, the migration itself can result in disease-like symptoms. During an infection, millions of neutrophils are recruited from the blood, but they die after a few days.

=== Monocytes ===
Monocytes develop in the bone marrow and reach maturity in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs and in doing so transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive. There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of human blood.

=== Macrophages ===
Mature macrophages do not travel far but stand guard over those areas of the body that are exposed to the outside world. There they act as garbage collectors, antigen presenting cells, or ferocious killers, depending on the signals they receive. They derive from monocytes, granulocyte stem cells, or the cell division of pre-existing macrophages. Human macrophages are about 21 micrometers in diameter.

This type of phagocyte does not have granules but contains many lysosomes. Macrophages are found throughout the body in almost all tissues and organs (e.g., microglial cells in the brain and alveolar macrophages in the lungs), where they silently lie in wait. A macrophage&#x27;s location can determine its size and appearance. Macrophages cause inflammation through the production of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and TNF-alpha. Macrophages are usually only found in tissue and are rarely seen in blood circulation. The life-span of tissue macrophages has been estimated to range from four to fifteen days.

Macrophages can be activated to perform functions that a resting monocyte cannot. T helper cells (also known as effector T cells or Th cells), a sub-group of lymphocytes, are responsible for the activation of macrophages. Th1 cells activate macrophages by signaling with IFN-gamma and displaying the protein CD40 ligand. Other signals include TNF-alpha and lipopolysaccharides from bacteria. Th1 cells can recruit other phagocytes to the site of the infection in several ways. They secrete cytokines that act on the bone marrow to stimulate the production of monocytes and neutrophils, and they secrete some of the cytokines that are responsible for the migration of monocytes and neutrophils out of the bloodstream. Th1 cells come from the differentiation of CD4+ T cells once they have responded to antigen in the secondary lymphoid tissues. Activated macrophages play a potent role in tumor destruction by producing TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen compounds, cationic proteins, and hydrolytic enzymes.

=== Neutrophils ===
Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, constituting 50% to 60% of the total circulating white blood cells. One litre of human blood contains about five billion neutrophils, which are about 10 micrometers in diameter and live for only about five days. Once they have received the appropriate signals, it takes them about thirty minutes to leave the blood and reach the site of an infection. They are ferocious eaters and rapidly engulf invaders coated with antibodies and complement, and damaged cells or cellular debris. Neutrophils do not return to the blood; they turn into pus cells and die. Mature neutrophils are smaller than monocytes and have a segmented nucleus with several sections; each section is connected by chromatin filaments—neutrophils can have 2–5 segments. Neutrophils do not normally exit the bone marrow until maturity but during an infection neutrophil precursors called metamyelocytes, myelocytes and promyelocytes are released.

The intra-cellular granules of the human neutrophil have long been recognized for their protein-destroying and bactericidal properties. Neutrophils can secrete products that stimulate monocytes and macrophages. Neutrophil secretions increase phagocytosis and the formation of reactive oxygen compounds involved in intracellular killing. Secretions from the primary granules of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of IgG-antibody-coated bacteria. When encountering bacteria, fungi or activated platelets they produce web-like chromatin structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Composed mainly of DNA, NETs cause death by a process called netosis – after the pathogens are trapped in NETs they are killed by oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms.

=== Dendritic cells ===
Dendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells that have long outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells are present in the tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.
Mature dendritic cells activate T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells. The activated helper T cells interact with macrophages and B cells to activate them in turn. In addition, dendritic cells can influence the type of immune response produced; when they travel to the lymphoid areas where T cells are held they can activate T cells, which then differentiate into cytotoxic T cells or helper T cells.

=== Mast cells ===

Mast cells have Toll-like receptors and interact with dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells to help mediate adaptive immune functions. Mast cells express MHC class II molecules and can participate in antigen presentation; however, the mast cell&#x27;s role in antigen presentation is not very well understood. Mast cells can consume and kill gram-negative bacteria (e.g., salmonella), and process their antigens. They specialize in processing the fimbrial proteins on the surface of bacteria, which are involved in adhesion to tissues. In addition to these functions, mast cells produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory response. This is a vital part of the destruction of microbes because the cytokines attract more phagocytes to the site of infection.

== Non-professional phagocytes ==
Dying cells and foreign organisms are consumed by cells other than the &quot;professional&quot; phagocytes. These cells include epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, melanocyte and mesenchymal cells. They are called non-professional phagocytes, to emphasize that, in contrast to professional phagocytes, phagocytosis is not their principal function. Fibroblasts, for example, which can phagocytose collagen in the process of remolding scars, will also make some attempt to ingest foreign particles.

Non-professional phagocytes are more limited than professional phagocytes in the type of particles they can take up. This is due to their lack of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most non-professional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.

== Pathogen evasion and resistance ==

A pathogen is only successful in infecting an organism if it can get past its defenses. Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have developed a variety of methods to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and replicate within phagocytic cells.

=== Avoiding contact ===
There are several ways bacteria avoid contact with phagocytes. First, they can grow in sites that phagocytes are not capable of traveling to (e.g., the surface of unbroken skin). Second, bacteria can suppress the inflammatory response; without this response to infection phagocytes cannot respond adequately. Third, some species of bacteria can inhibit the ability of phagocytes to travel to the site of infection by interfering with chemotaxis. Fourth, some bacteria can avoid contact with phagocytes by tricking the immune system into &quot;thinking&quot; that the bacteria are &quot;self&quot;. &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;—the bacterium that causes syphilis—hides from phagocytes by coating its surface with fibronectin, which is produced naturally by the body and plays a crucial role in wound healing.

=== Avoiding engulfment ===
Bacteria often produce capsules made of proteins or sugars that coat their cells and interfere with phagocytosis. Some examples are the K5 capsule and O75 O antigen found on the surface of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, and the exopolysaccharide capsules of &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;. &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; produces several types of capsule that provide different levels of protection, and group A streptococci produce proteins such as M protein and fimbrial proteins to block engulfment. Some proteins hinder opsonin-related ingestion; &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; produces Protein A to block antibody receptors, which decreases the effectiveness of opsonins. Enteropathogenic species of the genus Yersinia bind with the use of the virulence factor YopH to receptors of phagocytes from which they influence the cells capability to exert phagocytosis.

=== Survival inside the phagocyte ===

Bacteria have developed ways to survive inside phagocytes, where they continue to evade the immune system. To get safely inside the phagocyte they express proteins called invasins. When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes. Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome, to form the phagolysosome. Other pathogens, such as &quot;Leishmania&quot;, create a highly modified vacuole inside the phagocyte, which helps them persist and replicate. Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome. &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, for example, produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which break down chemicals—such as hydrogen peroxide—produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria. Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before the formation of the phagolysosome: &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called listeriolysin O and phospholipase C. &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; infects neutrophils that are in turn ingested by macrophages and thereby infect latter as well. &quot;M. leprae&quot; infects macrophages, schwann cells, and neutrophils.

=== Killing ===
Bacteria have developed several ways of killing phagocytes. These include cytolysins, which form pores in the phagocyte&#x27;s cell membranes, streptolysins and leukocidins, which cause neutrophils&#x27; granules to rupture and release toxic substances, and exotoxins that reduce the supply of a phagocyte&#x27;s ATP, needed for phagocytosis. After a bacterium is ingested, it may kill the phagocyte by releasing toxins that travel through the phagosome or phagolysosome membrane to target other parts of the cell.

=== Disruption of cell signaling ===

Some survival strategies often involve disrupting cytokines and other methods of cell signaling to prevent the phagocyte&#x27;s responding to invasion. The protozoan parasites &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;, and &quot;Leishmania&quot; infect macrophages, and each has a unique way of taming them. Some species of &quot;Leishmania&quot; alter the infected macrophage&#x27;s signalling, repress the production of cytokines and microbicidal molecules—nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species—and compromise antigen presentation.

== Host damage by phagocytes ==
Macrophages and neutrophils, in particular, play a central role in the inflammatory process by releasing proteins and small-molecule inflammatory mediators that control infection but can damage host tissue. In general, phagocytes aim to destroy pathogens by engulfing them and subjecting them to a battery of toxic chemicals inside a phagolysosome. If a phagocyte fails to engulf its target, these toxic agents can be released into the environment (an action referred to as &quot;frustrated phagocytosis&quot;). As these agents are also toxic to host cells, they can cause extensive damage to healthy cells and tissues.

When neutrophils release their granule contents in the kidney, the contents of the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause kidney failure.

Neutrophils also play a key role in the development of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.

Chemicals released by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α is an important chemical that is released by macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. If a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation and a decrease in plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.

== Evolutionary origins ==

Phagocytosis is common and probably appeared early in evolution, evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebae are unicellular protists that separated from the tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells. &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll-like receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug. This multicellular organism eventually will produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens has the potential to compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish between self and non-self is a pivotal one, and is the root of the immune system of many species of amoeba.

<text>Coryphaena is a genus of marine ray-finned fishes known as the dolphinfishes, and is currently the only known genus in the family Coryphaenidae. The generic name is from Greek κορυφή (&quot;koryphē&quot;, &quot;crown, top&quot;) and -αινα (-&quot;aina&quot;, feminine suffix). Species in this genus have compressed heads and single dorsal fins that run the entire length of the fishes&#x27; bodies.

Dolphinfish are aggressive predatory fish that actively prey upon oceanic forage fishes, while in turn serving as a primary food source for many larger pelagic predators. The dolphinfish can reach up to about , and are some of the fastest-growing species in the ocean.

Despite the name, dolphinfishes are unrelated to and look unlike dolphins (which are marine mammals with pointed snouts), and commercially their meat is often labeled with its Hawaiian name mahi-mahi to reduce possible public confusion. The origin of the name &quot;dolphinfish&quot; is recent, to avoid confusion with dolphins, as the traditional name of the fish was also &quot;dolphin&quot;. Why the mammal and the fish were both called &quot;dolphin&quot; is uncertain, but theories include that dolphinfish communicate using high-pitched sounds similar to a dolphin, and they are about the size of a small dolphin, or due to &quot;dorado&quot; (Spanish for &quot;golden&quot;) having been purportedly used historically in Spanish for both dolphins (normally &quot;delfín&quot;) and dolphinfish.

<text>The 2004 Royal Rumble was the 17th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion&#x27;s Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on January 25, 2004, at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year&#x27;s WrestleMania, in this instance, WrestleMania XX. Beginning with this Royal Rumble, the winner could choose which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania, either Raw&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship or SmackDown!&#x27;s WWE Championship.

Six professional wrestling matches were featured on the event&#x27;s supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main event was the 2004 Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from both brands. SmackDown!&#x27;s Chris Benoit, the first entrant, won the match by last eliminating Big Show, also from SmackDown!. This win resulted in Benoit breaking the longevity record last held by Bob Backlund, staying in the match for over one hour, but was then broken by Rey Mysterio in 2006. Benoit also became the second wrestler to win the match as the first entrant, after Shawn Michaels. The primary match on the Raw brand was a Last Man Standing match between Triple H and Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship, which ended in a draw. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was Brock Lesnar versus Hardcore Holly for the WWE Championship, which Lesnar won to retain the championship. The featured match on the undercard was a tables match for the World Tag Team Championship between Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista) and Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), which Evolution won to retain the titles.

===Background===

The Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2004 event was the 17th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 25, 2004, at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands.

The Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year&#x27;s WrestleMania. The previous year, the winner earned a match for their respective brand&#x27;s top championship, but for 2004, the winner could choose to challenge for either brands&#x27; world championship at WrestleMania XX: Raw&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship or SmackDown!&#x27;s WWE Championship.

=== Storylines ===
The card included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE&#x27;s writers on the Raw and SmackDown! brands, while storylines were produced on WWE&#x27;s weekly television shows, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

The buildup to the Royal Rumble match started on the January 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when John Cena interrupted a promo from SmackDown! General Manager Paul Heyman about the Tribute to the Troops event in Iraq. This angered Heyman and Heyman forced Cena to compete in a handicap match with a partner and the two needed to win the match to gain entry in the Royal Rumble match. Cena&#x27;s partner was revealed to be Chris Benoit and the two defeated The Full Blooded Italians (Nunzio, Chuck Palumbo, and Johnny Stamboli) to qualify for the Royal Rumble match. As a result, all the three members of Full Blooded Italians lost their spots in the Royal Rumble match; had Cena and Benoit would have lost, neither would have been able to participate in the match. After the match, Kurt Angle announced that he would participate in the Royal Rumble match and would win it. Later that night, Benoit insulted Heyman and Heyman forced Benoit to compete at the #1 spot in the Royal Rumble. On the January 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane announced that he was going to win the Royal Rumble but was confronted by Booker T, who claimed that he would eliminate Kane from the match and win the match. Three days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Benoit defeated the Full Blooded Italians in a handicap mini Royal Rumble to retain his spot in the Royal Rumble. On the January 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg defeated Matt Hardy and announced that he would participate in the Royal Rumble match. On the January 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, several qualifying matches were held for the Royal Rumble, including a battle royal between the Full Blooded Italians, which Nunzio won. On the January 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg, Randy Orton, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Mark Henry, and Chris Jericho won matches to qualify for a Battle Royal to determine the #30 entrant of the Royal Rumble match. Goldberg won the match and earned the #30 spot in the Royal Rumble.

The main rivalry heading into the event from the Raw brand was between Triple H and Shawn Michaels over the World Heavyweight Championship. At Armageddon, Triple H defeated Goldberg and Kane in a triple threat match to win the World Heavyweight Championship after interference from Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista). On the December 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels and Rob Van Dam defeated Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) in a handicap match, when Michaels pinned Triple H. As a result, Michaels earned a World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H on the December 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas. Michaels seemingly defeated Triple H to win the title, but the Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff declared the match a draw due to both men&#x27;s shoulders being down on the mat during the pinfall. As a result, Triple H retained the title. On the January 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the self-proclaimed Sheriff of Raw Stone Cold Steve Austin announced that Triple H would defend the title against Michaels in a Last Man Standing match at Royal Rumble.

The main rivalry heading into the event from the SmackDown! brand was between Brock Lesnar and Hardcore Holly over the WWE Championship. The rivalry could be dated back to September 12, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when Lesnar defeated Holly in a non-title match and injured him by breaking his neck, putting him out of action for over a year. A year later, at Survivor Series, Holly returned to WWE from injury to take revenge from Lesnar. On the December 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Paul Heyman announced that Holly would team with Shannon Moore in a tag team match against A-Train and Matt Morgan, in which Holly could get a match of his choosing if he won but if he lost, his WWE contract would be terminated. Holly and Moore won the match, allowing Holly to wrestle a match of his choosing. On the January 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Holly intentionally got disqualified in a match against Big Show by brutally assaulting him. On the January 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Holly defeated Big Show in a street fight. As a result, Big Show placed a restraining order on Holly and Lesnar stayed with Big Show to protect himself from Holly. On the January 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Holly attacked Lesnar during a handicap match pitting Lesnar, Big Show, Matt Morgan, and Rhyno against John Cena and Chris Benoit. This led to a match between Lesnar and Holly for the WWE Championship at Royal Rumble.

A secondary rivalry heading into the event from the SmackDown! brand was between Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero. At Survivor Series, the Basham Brothers (Doug Basham and Danny Basham) defeated Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo) to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship. After the event, Los Guerreros started to break up as a team when Chavo began blaming Eddie for the team&#x27;s recent failure. On the November 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Los Guerreros defeated The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) but after the match, Haas and Benjamin attacked Chavo and injured his leg. This caused Chavo to blame Eddie for the injury. On the November 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Chavo was attacked again and he blamed Eddie. This continued on the December 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when Eddie helped Chavo in defeating Benjamin in a one-on-one match. Chavo blamed Eddie for stealing the spotlight that Chavo needed. On the January 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Eddie and Chavo finally broke up the team after losing to The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team. However, on the January 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kurt Angle reunited Los Guerreros and earned them a WWE Tag Team Championship match against the Basham Brothers, which Los Guerreros lost. After the match, Los Guerreros finally ended when Chavo attacked Eddie and caused him to bleed. As a result, Chavo turned heel. On the January 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle informed Eddie that the SmackDown! General Manager Paul Heyman had made a match between Eddie and Chavo at Royal Rumble.

The secondary rivalry heading into the event from the Raw brand was between Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista) and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) over the World Tag Team Championship. At Armageddon, Flair and Batista defeated Dudley Boyz in a Tag Team Turmoil match to win the World Tag Team Championship. On the December 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair served as the special guest referee during a match pitting Dudley Boyz against two enhancement talents. Flair awarded the victory to enhancement talents by disqualifying Dudley Boyz. Batista then came out and attacked Dudley Boyz from behind. On the January 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair and Batista defeated Dudley Boyz to retain the World Tag Team Championship. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista defeated D-Von in a one-on-one match. After the match, Flair tossed a table into the ring and Batista set it up but Bubba Ray entered the ring and chased Flair and Batista. On the January 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Evolution member Randy Orton defeated The Hurricane in a match. After the match, Flair and Batista came out to congratulate Orton. Hurricane&#x27;s tag team partner Rosey came out to check on him but was attacked by Batista. It led to Dudley Boyz coming out to deliver a 3-D on Flair through the table but Jonathan Coachman ran down to stop them and was hit with a 3D through the table by Dudley Boyz. This led to a tables match between Dudley Boyz and Evolution for the World Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble.

Another secondary rivalry heading into the event from the SmackDown! brand was between Rey Mysterio and Jamie Noble over the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. On the January 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio defeated Tajiri to win the Cruiserweight Championship. The following week, Tajiri and Noble were scheduled to have a number one contender&#x27;s match for the Cruiserweight Championship, but Noble was not present on the show. As a result, Paul Heyman ordered Noble&#x27;s manager Nidia to replace Noble in the match. Tajiri easily defeated Nidia. After the match, Tajiri tried to assault Nidia, but Mysterio rescued her. This prompted Noble to come out and attack Mysterio as he thought that Mysterio was trying to harm Nidia. On the January 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Noble defeated Tajiri to become the number one contender for the Cruiserweight Championship at Royal Rumble.

==Event==
===Pre-show===
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Victoria defeated Molly Holly by pinning her after a Gory Neckbreaker, which Victoria calls &quot;Widow&#x27;s Peak&quot;. The match aired live on &quot;Heat&quot;.

===Preliminary matches===
The actual event opened with Evolution (Batista and Ric Flair) defending the World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a tables match. Jonathan Coachman interfered in the match as he distracted The Dudley Boyz, who attempted a Whassup on Coachman but Flair prevented the move. D-Von performed a Clothesline on Flair, allowing Batista to perform a Spinebuster through a table on D-Von to retain the titles.

Next, Rey Mysterio defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Jamie Noble. Noble&#x27;s manager Nidia held Noble&#x27;s legs, thinking he was Mysterio. Mysterio took advantage and performed a 619 and Droppin&#x27; Da Dime on Noble to retain the title.

After that, Eddie Guerrero faced Chavo Guerrero. Chavo Guerrero Sr. interfered and attacked Eddie throughout the match. Eddie performed the Three Amigos and a Frog Splash on Chavo to win the match. After the match, Eddie attacked Chavo and Chavo Sr., causing Chavo to bleed.

===Main event matches===
In the fourth match, Brock Lesnar defended the WWE Championship against Hardcore Holly. Holly performed an Alabama Slam on Lesnar and applied a Full Nelson on Lesnar. After the two rolled out of the ring, Lesnar broke the hold by performing a Hangman on Holly. Lesnar performed an F5 on Holly to retain the title.

In the fifth match, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels in a Last Man Standing match. Triple H attempted a Pedigree onto a steel chair on Michaels but Michaels countered and dropped Triple H onto the steel chair. Michaels attempted Sweet Chin Music on Triple H, but Triple H low blowed Michaels. Triple H performed a DDT and a Pedigree on Michaels, but Michaels stood at a 9 count. Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on Triple H but fell himself, resulting in the match ending in a draw and Triple H retained the title.
The main event was the annual 30-man Royal Rumble match, where the winner would get to wrestle the world champion of his brand at WrestleMania XX. Chris Benoit and Randy Orton were the first two entrants. As the match started, Benoit and Orton battled each other until Mark Henry entered at #3 and began attacking both Benoit and Orton. Tajiri entered at #4 and performed a Handspring Back Elbow on Orton. Orton battled Henry and Benoit battled Tajiri until Bradshaw entered at #5 and began dominating all the participants by finishing off Orton, then Henry, then Tajiri, with three consecutive Clotheslines from Hell. Bradshaw attempted to perform a Clothesline from Hell on Benoit, but Benoit countered it into a Crippler Crossface. Bradshaw got out of the hold by picking Benoit up and tossing him over the top rope. However, Benoit jumped on the apron and eliminated Bradshaw instead. Rhyno entered at #6 and attacked Orton, before focusing on Benoit. Tajiri battled Henry and applied a Tarantula on Henry. Rhyno performed a Spinebuster on Benoit and attempted to perform a Gore on Benoit but Benoit avoided the move and Rhyno instead crashed a rope hung Tajiri. This caused Tajiri to get eliminated from the match. Benoit then tossed Henry over the top rope, eliminating him. Matt Hardy entered at #7, but was quickly tossed over the top rope by Benoit but Hardy landed on the apron. Rhyno tried to eliminate Hardy but Hardy stayed in the ring. Scott Steiner entered at #8 and started dominating all of the participants of the match. Hardy and Orton battled in the corner, where Hardy had nearly eliminated Orton until Benoit attacked Hardy and Orton was saved from being eliminated. Matt Morgan entered at #9 and he performed a Sitout Powerbomb on Benoit and a Big Boot on Hardy. The Hurricane entered at #10 and performed a Diving Crossbody on Hardy. The Hurricane then began fighting Morgan, who dominated The Hurricane and eliminated him by tossing him over the top rope. Morgan then tried to eliminate Hardy in the same way, but Hardy landed on the apron and stayed in the ring. Benoit began fighting Rhyno, Steiner battled Orton and Hardy battled Morgan until Booker T entered at #11. Booker T attacked Steiner and then performed a Scissors Kick on Orton. Booker T then eliminated Steiner from the match. Kane entered at #12. Morgan started attacking Kane but Kane performed a Chokeslam on Morgan. Kane performed a Big Boot on Rhyno and then Kane chokeslammed Orton. Eventually, The Undertaker&#x27;s entrance theme music began playing in the arena and the lights went out. When the lights came back, Kane was distracted and Booker T eliminated Kane from behind. Following Kane&#x27;s elimination, Spike Dudley entered at #13. Kane was angered at it and he thought that it was Dudley, who played The Undertaker&#x27;s gong. An enraged Kane performed a Chokeslam on Dudley on the ramp and Dudley was knocked out which meant that he was unable to participate in the Royal Rumble. Rikishi entered at #14. Along with Rikishi&#x27;s entrance, Benoit backdropped Rhyno over the top rope, eliminating him. Rikishi started attacking Hardy and performed a Stink Face on Morgan. René Duprée entered at #15 and started battling Hardy before dropkicking him over the top rope to eliminate him. However, after eliminating Hardy, Duprée was eliminated himself by Rikishi when Rikishi performed a Savate Kick on Duprée, causing him to fall over the top rope. A-Train entered at #16 and began attacking Rikishi. Benoit eventually eliminated Morgan. Orton began dominating the match as he eliminated Rikishi and then backdropped Booker T over the top rope to eliminate him. Benoit battled A-Train, while Shelton Benjamin entered at #17. Benoit eliminated A-Train and Benjamin tried to perform a Superkick on Orton, but Orton ducked the move and eliminated Benjamin. The first two entrants of the match, Benoit and Orton were left remaining. Ernest Miller entered at #18, along with his manager Lamont. Instead of using the opportunity of eliminating the knocked out Benoit and Orton, Miller and his manager Lamont danced to Miller&#x27;s entrance theme. However, Benoit and Orton recovered and ruined the dance as Benoit tossed Lamont over the top rope and Orton eliminated Miller from the match. Following Miller&#x27;s elimination, Benoit and Orton continued to battle each other. Kurt Angle entered at #19 and began fighting Benoit while Orton recovered in the corner. Rico entered at #20 and began battling Orton. Rico performed a Roundhouse Kick on Orton while Benoit performed three consecutive German Suplexes on Angle in a row. Orton recovered and backdropped Rico over the top rope, eliminating him. Test&#x27;s music began playing at #21 but Test did not appear, as he was found knocked out at backstage by some doctors and the Raw Sheriff Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin ordered someone to replace Test and gave him the #21 entry number. This person was revealed to be Mick Foley who immediately started attacking Orton. Foley performed a Flying Clothesline on Orton, eliminating Orton and himself in the process. Foley and Orton continued to fight each other after their eliminations. Christian entered at #22 and started battling Benoit and Angle. Foley and Orton numerously attacked each other, where Foley was about to perform a mandible claw on Orton until Nunzio entered at #23 and Foley turned his focus on Nunzio and performed a Mandible Claw on Nunzio, knocking him down. Orton attacked Foley and then retreated to the backstage. Angle battled Christian and Benoit in the ring while Nunzio sat in the ringside, instead of entering the ring.

Billy Gunn entered at #27 and performed a Legdrop Bulldog, which he called &quot;Fameasser&quot; on Angle. Gunn then performed a Fameasser on Jericho and fought Big Show and Haas. John Cena entered at #28 but instead of entering the ring, he focused on Nunzio, who was sitting in the ringside. Cena tossed Nunzio into the ring and began attacking him until Big Show started attacking Cena. Big Show and Nunzio double-teamed Cena until Nunzio attempted to eliminate Big Show, but failed. Cena started attacking Big Show and tried to eliminate him while Nunzio tried to eliminate Benoit. Rob Van Dam entered at #29 and started dominating all the participants of the match. Nunzio tried to eliminate Van Dam but Haas battled Nunzio. Big Show battled Gunn and Cena performed a Fireman&#x27;s Carry Takeover, which he called &quot;F-U&quot;, on Angle. Goldberg entered at #30 and performed a Spear on Big Show and then speared Gunn. Goldberg punched several wrestlers including Angle, Jericho, Van Dam, Cena, and Haas. Nunzio jumped on Goldberg&#x27;s back while Goldberg eliminated Haas from the match. Van Dam kicked Goldberg. Goldberg speared Nunzio and then clotheslined Gunn over the top rope, eliminating him. Goldberg picked up Nunzio in a Military Press and threw him over the top rope, eliminating him from the match. Goldberg started attacking Big Show, until Brock Lesnar interfered in the match and performed a F5 on Goldberg and left the ring. Goldberg was distracted and when he recovered, Angle eliminated him from behind. Benoit, Angle, Jericho, Cena and Van Dam all teamed up against Big Show when Big Show picked up Cena and Angle performed a Chop Block on Big Show. Van Dam performed a Slingshot Legdrop and followed it with a Five-Star Frog Splash on Big Show. All the five participants tried to eliminate Big Show, but Big Show shoved all of them and eliminated Cena. Van Dam attempted to perform a Monkey Flip on Big Show, but Big Show tossed him over the top rope, eliminating Van Dam, leaving Big Show, Benoit, Angle and Jericho as the final four competitors. Big Show backdropped Jericho over the top rope but Jericho landed on the apron and entered the ring. Jericho applied an Elevated Boston Crab, which he calls &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; on Big Show. Angle attacked Jericho and Big Show picked up Jericho and eliminated him. Big Show chokeslammed Benoit and fought Angle. Angle performed an Olympic Slam, which he calls &quot;Angle Slam&quot; on Big Show and then performed an Angle Slam on Benoit. Big Show eventually tried to perform a Chokeslam on Angle but Angle rolled it into an Ankle Lock. Big Show was near the ropes, and he flipped out of the Ankle Lock, causing Angle to get eliminated. Big Show landed on the apron. Benoit climbed the top rope and performed a Flying Forearm on the back of Big Show&#x27;s neck, sending Big Show back into the ring. Big Show tried to perform a Chokeslam on Benoit, but Benoit countered it into a Crippler Crossface. Benoit eventually landed on the apron while applying a front headlock on Big Show. He dragged Big Show over the top rope, who flipped over and got tossed on the floor over the top rope, getting eliminated. As a result, Benoit won the Royal Rumble match and became the second person in history to win the match from the #1 spot (after Shawn Michaels in 1995 and later Edge in 2021 and Rhea Ripley in 2023). He also broke Bob Backlund&#x27;s longevity record in 1993 by staying in the match for 1:01:30.

==Aftermath==
On the following night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during a confrontation between Triple H and Shawn Michaels, the Raw Sheriff Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened and announced that even though he could not make a match between the two (Austin having lost his Co-General Manager powers at Survivor Series in November), he would &quot;uphold the law&quot; and announced that Michaels would not get the next shot at Triple H because he did not win the Royal Rumble. Austin revealed that the Royal Rumble winner would face &quot;the champion&quot; at WrestleMania XX, but that there was no specification as to which champion— thus, creating a loophole that Chris Benoit, who was then property of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, exploited to announce that he would join the Raw brand and instead chase the World Heavyweight Championship due in part to bad feelings between himself and SmackDown! General Manager Paul Heyman. On the February 9 episode, Benoit and Triple H were to have their contract signing for the WrestleMania match, but Michaels interfered and hit Sweet Chin Music on Benoit then signed the contract himself. The following week, after Michaels defeated Benoit in a singles match, Austin announced that Triple H would defend the title against Benoit and Michaels in a triple threat match at WrestleMania. At WrestleMania, Benoit defeated Michaels and Triple H by submitting the latter to the Crippler Crossface to win the World Heavyweight Championship. Benoit&#x27;s defection led to a rule change for the Royal Rumble winner, where he could now choose which world champion he would face at WrestleMania.

=== SmackDown! Royal Rumble ===
Meanwhile, on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, in order to make up for Benoit&#x27;s defection, Heyman announced that a second Royal Rumble match featuring fifteen of &quot;SmackDown!&#x27;s&quot; wrestlers competing for a shot at Brock Lesnar&#x27;s WWE Championship at No Way Out in February. The thirteen &quot;SmackDown!&quot; wrestlers (Kurt Angle, Rhyno, Charlie Haas, Shelton Benjamin, Bradshaw, Ernest Miller, Tajiri, Billy Gunn, Big Show, John Cena, Nunzio, A-Train, and Rikishi) who competed in the original Royal Rumble match were given entries in the match as were Hardcore Holly and Eddie Guerrero (Holly, who replaced an injured Matt Morgan, wrestled and lost to Lesnar at the Rumble and Guerrero, who replaced Benoit, was continuing his feud with Chavo). Guerrero won the match and earned the title opportunity. At No Way Out, Guerrero defeated Lesnar to win the WWE Championship.

===Impact of Benoit tragedy===
Chris Benoit murdered his wife and son before committing suicide over the weekend of June 22–24, 2007. Once the details of Benoit&#x27;s actions became apparent, WWE made the decision to remove nearly all mentions of Benoit from their website, future broadcasts, and all publications. As a result, this Royal Rumble and Benoit&#x27;s victory is often ignored in official publications. When referring to the #1 entrant, WWE personalities occasionally stated, for instance, &quot;two people have won from the number one position, including Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels in 1995&quot;, as commentator John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) did in 2015. Edge and Rhea Ripley would since become the third and fourth wrestlers to win as the first entrant in 2021 and 2023, respectively, which WWE acknowledged they were the third and fourth to do so, but only mentioned Shawn Michaels as the other to accomplish this. Coverage of the Royal Rumble has been very selective; no photos of Benoit exist on WWE&#x27;s webpage for the event, focusing rather on the Last Man Standing match between Triple H and Shawn Michaels, and Benoit is only mentioned on the results page as the winner of the event. Only a few WWE video features include footage from the Royal Rumble match, but those that do use careful shot selection so that Benoit is not seen on screen. WWE&#x27;s website has also posted photo galleries dedicated to the number one entrants and winners in the Royal Rumble history, both of which completely ignore Chris Benoit and the year of 2004. The pay-per-view and the Royal Rumble match, however, exist in their entirety on the WWE Network unedited. Benoit went on to win the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XX (which like this Rumble, it is also available in its entirety on the WWE Network unedited), but like his near erasure from this Royal Rumble, WWE only lists his name in the official title history but have removed the match description (this is also the case for any other WWE-owned title that he has won), as well as the match description for when Randy Orton defeated him for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam.

<text>Great Dunmow is a historic market town and civil parish in the Uttlesford district of Essex, England. It lies to the north of the A120 road, approximately midway between Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Braintree, east of London Stansted Airport.

Originally the site of a Roman settlement on Stane Street, the town thrived during the Middle Ages. Dunmow means &quot;Meadow on the Hill&quot;. The settlement was variously referred to as Dunmow Magna, Much Dunmow, or most commonly Great Dunmow.

==History==
A Roman small town developed on the junction between Stane Street and the Roman roads which ran northeast to southwest from Sudbury to London, and northwest to southeast from Cambridge to Chelmsford. The main settlement area spread westwards from the road junction, with cemeteries on the outskirts. There was a second Roman settlement at Church End immediately to the north of present-day Great Dunmow; the site likely included a rural Roman Temple.

Between the occupation by the Romans and the time of the Saxons, the town acquired its name: in AD951 it was named Dunemowe, and later Dommawe. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the area including Great Dunmow and Little Dunmow had seven manors. Some of these still exist – in name at least – including Bigods, Newton Hall (seat of the Henniker baronets), Merks Hall, Minchins and Shingle Hall. The earliest record of a church in the town is in 1045, and in 1197 Geoffrey de Dunmow was rector.

In medieval times, Dunmow was a thriving commercial centre, with market charters granted in 1253 and two fairs held annually until the 19th century. Dunmow&#x27;s Corporation was granted in 1555 and confirmed in 1590.

Both Roman settlements were re-occupied during the Saxon period, at Great Dunmow in the seventh century and at Church End in the later Saxon period. The earliest medieval settlement appears to have been a continuation of the late Saxon settlement at Church End, where the parish church stands. The granting of a market charter may mark the time of the movement of the main focus of settlement from Church End to the High Street and market-place. The medieval and post-medieval development of Great Dunmow is reflected both in the surviving built heritage, which includes 167 listed buildings, and the below-ground archaeology.

Great Dunmow was on the GHQ Line, a series of defences and concrete pillboxes built to hinder an anticipated German invasion in the Second World War. Many of these remain and are clearly visible along the Chelmer valley, one being located on the west bank of the River Chelmer in meadows behind the Dourdan Pavilion and recreation ground.

Easton Lodge became RAF Great Dunmow in the war, and for a time was home to squadrons from the USAAF and the RAF. The site of the former airfield is now owned by Land Securities who in 2011 hoped to build a development including around 9,000 homes alongside significant supporting community, commercial and retail infrastructure, intending to call it Easton Park.

A nuclear bunker was built on the edge of the village, on land compulsorily purchased in 1959. Used by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps until the 1980s, it was returned to its original owner in 1991 and sold on privately in 2005.

== Parish Church ==
The Church of England parish church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin and is a Grade I listed building.
The current Rector is The Reverend Thomas Warmington who is also Rural Dean for the Dunmow and Stansted Deanery.

==Governance==

Great Dunmow is a civil parish with a parish council.

== Attractions ==
The town museum, the Maltings Museum, is on Mill Lane and covers local history. Great Dunmow is also the home of Talliston House &amp; Gardens, an ex-council house transformed by owner John Tarrow (née Trevillian) into &#x27;Britain&#x27;s most extraordinary home&#x27; (&quot;The Times&quot;). The house and gardens have been open to the public since 2015 and include 13 fantasy locations, each set in a different time and place. The Old Town Hall, which is in the Market Place, dates from the 16th century.

==Transport==

Great Dunmow is no longer served directly by the National Rail network. The nearest station is away in Braintree, where a generally hourly service along the Braintree branch line takes 63 minutes to London Liverpool Street. In addition, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford station is away, providing services along the West Anglia Main Line to Liverpool Street in 45 minutes. 

Until 1952, the town was served by Dunmow railway station on the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford-Braintree branch line; the line was opened to passengers on 22 February 1869 and closed on 3 March 1952. The line continued to be used for freight trains and occasional excursions, closing in stages with the final section to Easton Lodge closing on 17 February 1972. It is now possible to walk or cycle in either direction along the former track bed to Braintree station or to the edge of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford.

As the crow flies, the town is just under from Stansted Airport. 

The M11 motorway passes nearby, to the west of the town. The A120, from the M11 to Braintree, by-passes the town; the former route has now been re-designated the B1256. The latter itself was a bypass, built on the route of the old railway line and station. Until the 1970s, the A120 went through Great Dunmow town centre.

Great Dunmow continues to be served by regular bus services. Arriva Sapphire route 133 and Essex Airlink (operated by First Essex) route X20 both operate roughly hourly through the town between Stansted Airport and Braintree, with the X20 continuing further east towards Marks Tey and Colchester.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sudbury TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Essex on 103.5 FM, Heart East on 96.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly Dream 100 FM) on 100.2 FM, and Actual Radio an DAB station. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, the &quot;Dunmow Broadcast&quot;, which publishes on Thursdays.

==Flitch Trials==
The town is known for its four-yearly ritual of the &quot;Flitch Trials&quot;, in which couples must convince a jury of six local bachelors and six local maidens that, for a year and a day, they have never wished themselves unwed. If successful, the couple are paraded along the High Street and receive a flitch of bacon. The custom is ancient, and is mentioned in the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Prologue and Tale in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

==Twin town==
Great Dunmow is twinned with Dourdan in France.

<text>A Woodworking machine is a machine that is intended to process wood. These machines are usually powered by electric motors and are used extensively in woodworking. Sometimes grinding machines (used for grinding down to smaller pieces) are also considered a part of woodworking machinery.

==Types of woodworking machinery==

===Artisanal and hobby machines===
These machines are used both in small-scale commercial production of timber products and by hobbyists. Most of these machines may be used on solid timber and on composite products. Machines can be divided into the bigger stationary machines where the machine remains stationary while the material is moved over the machine, and hand-held power tools, where the tool is moved over the material.

====Hand-held power tools====
* Biscuit joiner
* Domino jointer
* Chain saw
* Hand-held circular saw
* Electric drill
* Jig saw
* Miter saw
* Nail gun
* Hand-held electric plane
* Reciprocating saw
* Rotary tool
* Router
* Hand-held sanders, including belt sander, orbital sander, random orbit sander

====Stationary machines====
* Bandsaw
* Combination machine
* Double side planer
* Four sided planer or timber sizer
* Drill press
* Drum sander
* Bench grinder
* Jointer
* Wood lathe
* Mortiser
* Panel saw
* Pin router or Overhead Router
* Radial arm saw
* Scroll saw
* Spindle moulder (Wood shaper)
* Stationary sanders, including stroke sanders, oscillating spindle sander, belt sander, disc sander (and combination disc-belt sander).
* Table saw
* Tenoner or tenoning machine
* Thicknesser or Thickness planer
* Round pole milling machine
* Round pole sanding machine

===Panel Line Woodworking machines===
These machines are used in large-scale manufacturing of cabinets and other wooden or panel products.

===Panel surface processing===

====Panel dividing equipment====
Panel dividing equipment, classified by number of beam, loading system, saw carriage speed

====Double end tenoner====
Double end tenoner, classified by conveyor type
* Rolling chain system conveyor speed 40 to 120 m/min
* Sliding chain system conveyor speed 10 to 30 m/min

===Panel edge processing equipment===
Panel edge processing equipment, classified by conveyor speed
* High speed edgebander conveyor speed &gt;= 100 m/min
* Heavy duty edgebander conveyor speed &gt;= 24 m/min
* Light duty edgebander conveyor speed &lt; 20 m/min (i.e. 8, 12 or 16 m/min)

===Panel boring equipment===

<text>South Holland is a local government district of Lincolnshire, England. The council is based in Spalding. Other notable towns and villages include Crowland, Sutton Bridge, Donington, Holbeach and Long Sutton. The district is named after the historical division of Lincolnshire known as the Parts of Holland.

The neighbouring districts are Boston, North Kesteven, South Kesteven, Peterborough, Fenland and King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of three former districts from the administrative county of Holland, which were all abolished at the same time:
*East Elloe Rural District
*Spalding Rural District
*Spalding Urban District
The new district was named South Holland referencing its position within Holland, one of the three historic parts of Lincolnshire.

In 2021 the district council joined East Lindsey District Council and Boston Borough Council in the &quot;South and East Lincolnshire Councils Partnership&quot; which shares management and other staff.

==Governance==
South Holland District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lincolnshire County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government. The town of Spalding is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 2003.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a by-election in November 2023, the composition of the council was:
The South Holland Independents and independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Independent Group&quot;. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Priory Road in Spalding. The original building had been completed in 1954 for the Spalding Rural District Council, one of the modern council&#x27;s predecessors. A large extension was added in front of the original building in 1991.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2007 the council has comprised 37 councillors representing 18 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Demographics==

There were 76,512 residents in the district at the 2001 census. The median age was nearly 43. 82.6% of people in the district claimed to adhere to a Christian religion – the highest proportion of any district in the East Midlands.

The 2011 census reports 88,270 people at 1.2 per hectare in 37,264 households.

Much of the district is low-lying and highly fertile agricultural land which is protected from flooding by land drainage. This is the responsibility of the South Holland Internal Drainage Board and the Environment Agency.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcast from the Belmont transmitter. BBC East Midlands and ITV Central can also be received from the Waltham TV transmitter. With the co-channel interference from the Waltham transmitter, a small number of households in the southern tip of the district are able to receive BBC East and ITV Anglia. 
Radio stations for the area are: 
*BBC Radio Lincolnshire on 104.7 FM and 94.9 FM
*BBC Radio Cambridgeshire can also be received on 95.7 FM,
*Lincs FM on DAB
*Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire on 96.7FM and 102.2 FM
*Connect Radio on 106.8 FM
*Heart East on 102.7 FM
*Tulip Radio (for Spalding) on 107.5 FM

<doc id="443439" wikidata="Q979637" url="?curid=443439" title="Determination of the day of the week">
<text>The determination of the day of the week for any date may be performed with a variety of algorithms. In addition, perpetual calendars require no calculation by the user, and are essentially lookup tables.
A typical application is to calculate the day of the week on which someone was born or a specific event occurred.

==Concepts==
In numerical calculation, the days of the week are represented as weekday numbers. If Monday is the first day of the week, the days may be coded 1 to 7, for Monday through Sunday, as is practiced in ISO 8601. The day designated with 7 may also be counted as &quot;0&quot;, by applying the arithmetic modulo 7, which calculates the remainder of a number after division by 7. Thus, the number 7 is treated as 0, the number 8 as 1, the number 9 as 2, the number 18 as 4, and so on. If Sunday is counted as day 1, then 7 days later (&quot;i.e.&quot;day 8) is also a Sunday, and day 18 is the same as day 4, which is a Wednesday since this falls three days after Sunday (&quot;i.e.&quot;).

The basic approach of nearly all of the methods to calculate the day of the week begins by starting from an &quot;anchor date&quot;: a known pair (such as 1 January 1800 as a Wednesday), determining the number of days between the known day and the day that you are trying to determine, and using arithmetic modulo 7 to find a new numerical day of the week.

One standard approach is to look up (or calculate, using a known rule) the value of the first day of the week of a given century, look up (or calculate, using a method of congruence) an adjustment for the month, calculate the number of leap years since the start of the century, and then add these together along with the number of years since the start of the century, and the day number of the month. Eventually, one ends up with a day-count to which one applies modulo 7 to determine the day of the week of the date.

Some methods do all the additions first and then cast out sevens, whereas others cast them out at each step, as in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s method. Either way is quite viable: the former is easier for calculators and computer programs, the latter for mental calculation (it is quite possible to do all the calculations in one&#x27;s head with a little practice). None of the methods given here perform range checks, so unreasonable dates will produce erroneous results.

===Corresponding days===
Every seventh day in a month has the same name as the previous:
===Corresponding months===
&quot;Corresponding months&quot; are those months within the calendar year that start on the same day of the week. For example, September and December correspond, because 1 September falls on the same day as 1 December (as there are precisely thirteen 7-day weeks between the two dates). Months can only correspond if the number of days between their first days is divisible by 7, or in other words, if their first days are a whole number of weeks apart. For example, February of a common year corresponds to March because February has 28 days, a number divisible by 7, 28 days being exactly four weeks.
In a leap year, January and February correspond to different months than in a common year, since adding 29 February means each subsequent month starts a day later.

January corresponds to October in common years and April and July in leap years. February corresponds to March and November in common years and August in leap years. March always corresponds to November, April always corresponds to July, and September always corresponds to December. August does not correspond to any other month in a common year. October doesn&#x27;t correspond to any other month in a leap year. May and June never correspond to any other month.

In the months table below, corresponding months have the same number, a fact which follows directly from the definition.
=== Corresponding years ===

There are seven possible days that a year can start on, and leap years will alter the day of the week after 29 February. This means that there are 14 configurations that a year can have. All the configurations can be referenced by a dominical letter, but as 29 February has no letter allocated to it, a leap year has two dominical letters, one for January and February and the other (one step back in the alphabetical sequence) for March to December.

2021 is a common year starting on Friday, which means that it corresponds to the 2010 calendar year. The first two months of 2021 correspond to the first two months of 2016. 2022 is a common year starting on Saturday, which means that it corresponds to the 2011 calendar year. The last ten months of 2022 correspond to the last ten months of 2016. 2023 is a common year starting on Sunday, which means that it corresponds to the 2017 calendar year. 2024 is a leap year starting on Monday, which means that it corresponds to the 1996 calendar year. The first two months of 2024 correspond to the first two months of 2018. The last ten months of 2024 correspond to the last ten months of 2019.

Each leap year repeats once every 28 years, and every common year repeats once every 6 years and twice every 11 years. For instance, the last occurrence of a leap year starting on Wednesday was 2020 and the next occurrence will be 2048. Likewise, the next common years starting on Friday will be 2027, 2038, and then 2049. Both of these statements are true unless a leap year is skipped, but that will not happen until 2100.

For details see the table below.

Notes:

* Black means all the months of Common Year
* Red means the first 2 months of Leap Year
* Blue means the last 10 months of Leap Year

===Corresponding centuries===

&quot;Year 000&quot; is, in normal chronology, the year 1 BC (which precedes AD 1). In astronomical year numbering the year 0 comes between 1 BC and AD 1. In the proleptic Julian calendar, (that is, the Julian calendar as it would have been if it had been operated correctly from the start), 1 BC starts on Thursday. In the proleptic Gregorian calendar, (so called because it wasn&#x27;t devised until 1582), 1 BC starts on Saturday.

==Tabular methods to calculate the day of the week==
===Complete table: Julian and Gregorian calendars===
For Julian dates before 1300 and after 1999 the year in the table which differs by an exact multiple of 700 years should be used. For Gregorian dates after 2299, the year in the table which differs by an exact multiple of 400 years should be used. The values &quot; through &quot; indicate the remainder when the Hundreds value is divided by 7 and 4 respectively, indicating how the series extend in either direction. Both Julian and Gregorian values are shown 1500-1999 for convenience. Bold figures (e.g., 04) denote leap year. If a year ends in 00 and its hundreds are in bold it is a leap year. Thus 19 indicates that 1900 is not a Gregorian leap year, (but 19 in the Julian column indicates that it &quot;is&quot; a Julian leap year, as are all Julian &quot;x&quot;00 years). 20 indicates that 2000 is a leap year. Use Jan and Feb only in leap years.

For determination of the day of the week (1 January 2000, Saturday)
*the day of the month: 1 ~ 31 (1)
*the month: (6)
*the year: (0)
*the century mod 4 for the Gregorian calendar and mod 7 for the Julian calendar (0).
*adding 1+6+0+0=7. Dividing by 7 leaves a remainder of 0, so the day of the week is Saturday.

The formula is w = (d + m + y + c) mod 7.

===Revised Julian calendar===
Note that the date (and hence the day of the week) in the Revised Julian and Gregorian calendars is the same from 14 October 1923 to 28 February AD 2800 inclusive and that for large years it may be possible to subtract 6300 or a multiple thereof before starting so as to reach a year which is within or closer to the table.

To look up the weekday of any date for any year using the table, subtract 100 from the year, divide the difference by 100, multiply the resulting quotient (omitting fractions) by seven and divide the product by nine. Note the quotient (omitting fractions). Enter the table with the Julian year, and just before the final division add 50 and subtract the quotient noted above.

Example: What is the day of the week of 27 January 8315?

8315−6300=2015, 2015−100=1915, 1915/100=19 remainder 15, 19×7=133, 133/9=14 remainder 7. 2015 is 700 years ahead of 1315, so 1315 is used. From table: for hundreds (13): 6. For remaining digits (15): 4. For month (January): 0. For date (27): 27. . 73/7=10 remainder 3. Day of week = Tuesday.

===Dominical Letter===
To find the Dominical Letter, calculate the day of the week for either 1 January or 1 October. If it is Sunday, the Dominical Letter is A, if Saturday B, and similarly backwards through the week and forwards through the alphabet to Monday, which is G.

Leap years have two Sunday Letters, so for January and February calculate the day of the week for 1 January and for March to December calculate the day of the week for 1 October.

Leap years are all years which divide exactly by four with the following exceptions:

In the Gregorian calendar – all years which divide exactly by 100 (other than those which divide exactly by 400).

In the Revised Julian calendar – all years which divide exactly by 100 (other than those which give remainder 200 or 600 when divided by 900).

=== The &quot;doomsday&quot; ===

This is an artefact of recreational mathematics. See doomsday rule for an explanation.

=== Check the result ===
Use this table for finding the day of the week without any calculations.

Examples:
*For common method
:&quot;26 December 1893 (GD)&quot;
December is in row F and 26 is in column E, so the letter for the date is C located in row F and column E. 93 (year mod 100) is in row D (year row) and the letter C in the year row is located in column G. 18 ([year/100] in the Gregorian century column) is in row C (century row) and the letter in the century row and column G is B, so the day of the week is Tuesday.
:&quot;13 October 1307 (JD)&quot;
October 13 is a F day. The letter F in the year row (07) is located in column G. The letter in the century row (13) and column G is E, so the day of the week is Friday.
:&quot;1 January 2000 (GD)&quot;
January 1 corresponds to G, G in the year row (00) corresponds to F in the century row (20), and F corresponds to Saturday.

A pithy formula for the method: &quot;&quot;Date letter (G), letter (G) is in year row (00) for the letter (F) in century row (20), and for the day, the letter (F) become weekday (Saturday)&quot;&quot;.

The Sunday Letter method

Each day of the year (other than 29 February) has a letter allocated to it in the recurring sequence ABCDEFG. The series begins with A on 1 January and continues to A again on 31 December. The Sunday letter is the one which stands against all the Sundays in the year. Since 29 February has no letter, this means that the Sunday Letter for March to December is one step back in the sequence compared to that for January and February. The letter for any date will be found where the row containing the month (in black) at the left of the &quot;Latin square&quot; meets the column containing the date above the &quot;Latin square&quot;. The Sunday letter will be found where the column containing the century (below the &quot;Latin square&quot;) meets the row containing the year&#x27;s last two digits to the right of the &quot;Latin square&quot;. For a leap year, the Sunday letter thus found is the one which applies to March to December.

So, for example, to find the weekday of 16 June 2020:

Column &quot;20&quot; meets row &quot;20&quot; at &quot;D&quot;. Row &quot;June&quot; meets column &quot;16&quot; at &quot;F&quot;. As F is two letters on from D, so the weekday is two days on from Sunday, i.e. Tuesday.

==Mathematical algorithms==
=== Rata Die===
The Rata Die method works by adding up the number of days that has passed since a date of known day of the week . The day of-the-week is then given by , conforming to whatever convention was used to encode .

For example, the date of 13 August 2009 is 733632 days from 1 January AD 1. Taking the number mod 7 yields 4, hence a Thursday.

===Gauss&#x27;s algorithm===
Carl Friedrich Gauss described a method for calculating the day of the week for 1 January in any given year in a handwritten note in a collection of astronomical tables. He never published it. It was finally included in his collected works in 1927. Compared to Rata Die, the result helps simplify the counting of years.

Gauss&#x27;s method was applicable to the Gregorian calendar. He numbered the weekdays from 0 to 6 starting with Sunday. He defined the following operation.

; Inputs
: Year number , month number , date number .
; Output
: Day of year.
; Procedure
:# First determine the day-of-week of 1 January.
:#* For a Gregorian calendar, the weekday is Alternatively, set , , and the value is 
:#* For a Julian calendar, the weekday is or .
:# Now determine the month-related offset by using the lookup table with .
:# Return .

The above procedure can be condensed into a single expression for the Gregorian case:
==== Worked example ====
For year number 2000, , and , the weekday of 1 January is
:

:

The weekdays for 30 April 1777 and 23 February 1855 are
:

and
:

==== Explanation and notes ====
The algorithm for the day-of-week of 1 Jan can be proven using modulo arithmetic. The main point is that because , each year adds 1 day to the progression. The rest is adjustment for leap year. The century-based versions have .

The table of month offsets show a divergence in February due to the leap year. A common technique (later used by Zeller) is to shift the month to start with March, so that the leap day is at the tail of the counting. In addition, as later shown by Zeller, the table can be replaced with an arithmetic expression.

This formula was also converted into graphical and tabular methods for calculating any day of the week by Kraitchik and Schwerdtfeger.

==== Disparate variation ====
The following formula is an example of a version without a lookup table. The year is assumed to begin in March, meaning dates in January and February should be treated as being part of the preceding year. The formula for the Gregorian calendar is

: formula_1
where

* is the day of the month (1 to 31)
* is the shifted month (March = 1...,February = 12)
* is the year unless is 11 = January or 12 = February which are considered part of the preceding year, giving 
* is the century given by formula_2
* is the year relative to the century, given by formula_3, or simply the last 2 digits of 
* is the day of the week (0 = Sunday...,6 = Saturday)

=== Zeller&#x27;s algorithm ===

In Zeller&#x27;s algorithm, the months are numbered from 3 for March to 14 for February. The year is assumed to begin in March; this means, for example, that January 1995 is to be treated as month 13 of 1994. 
The formula for the Gregorian calendar is
formula_4
where
* formula_5 is the day of the month (1 to 31)
* formula_6 is the shifted month (March=3...January = 13, February=14)
* formula_7 is the year unless formula_6 is 13 = January or 14 = February which are considered part of the preceding year giving formula_9
* formula_10 is the century given by formula_2
* formula_12 is the year relative to the century, given by formula_3, or simply the last 2 digits of formula_7
* formula_15 is the day of week (1 = Sunday..0 = Saturday)

The only difference is one between Zeller&#x27;s algorithm () and the Disparate Gaussian algorithm (), that is .

: formula_16
: formula_17 (March = 3 in but March = 1 in )
: formula_18
: formula_19

=== Wang&#x27;s algorithm ===
Wang&#x27;s algorithm for human calculation of the Gregorian calendar is (the formula should be subtracted by 1 if m is 1 or 2 if the year is a leap year)
formula_20
where
* is the last digit of the year (&quot;units)&quot;
* is the second last digit of the year (&quot;tens&quot;)
* is the century, given by formula_21
* is the day of the month (1 to 31)
* is the month (January=1...,December=12)
* is the day of the week (0=Sunday...,6=Saturday)
* is the null-days function (month offset) with values listed in the following table
An algorithm for the Julian calendar can be derived from the algorithm above
formula_22
where is a doomsday.
== Other algorithms ==
=== Schwerdtfeger&#x27;s method ===
In a partly tabular method by Schwerdtfeger, the year is split into the century and the two digit year within the century. The approach depends on the month. For ,
:formula_23
so is between 0 and 99. For ,
:formula_24
The formula for the day of the week is
:formula_25
where the positive modulus is chosen.

The value of is obtained from the following table:
The value of is obtained from the following table, which depends on the calendar. For the Gregorian calendar,

For the Julian calendar,
===Lewis Carroll&#x27;s method===

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) devised a method resembling a puzzle, yet partly tabular in using the same index numbers for the months as in the &quot;Complete table: Julian and Gregorian calendars&quot; above. He lists the same three adjustments for the first three months of non-leap years, one 7 higher for the last, and gives cryptic instructions for finding the rest; his adjustments for centuries are to be determined using formulas similar to those for the centuries table. Although explicit in asserting that his method also works for Old Style dates, his example reproduced below to determine that &quot;1676, February 23&quot; is a Wednesday only works on a Julian calendar which starts the year on January 1, instead of March 25 as on the &quot;Old Style&quot; Julian calendar.

Algorithm:

Take the given date in 4 portions, viz. the number of centuries, the number of years over, the month, the day of the month.

Compute the following 4 items, adding each, when found, to the total of the previous items. When an item or total exceeds 7, divide by 7, and keep the remainder only.

Century-item: For &#x27;Old Style&#x27; (which ended 2 September 1752) subtract from 18. For &#x27;New Style&#x27; (which began 14 September 1752) divide by 4, take overplus [surplus] from 3, multiply remainder by 2.

Year-item: Add together the number of dozens, the overplus, and the number of 4s in the overplus.

Month-item: If it begins or ends with a vowel, subtract the number, denoting its place in the year, from 10. This, plus its number of days, gives the item for the following month. The item for January is &quot;0&quot;; for February or March, &quot;3&quot;; for December, &quot;12&quot;.

Day-item: The total, thus reached, must be corrected, by deducting &quot;1&quot; (first adding 7, if the total be &quot;0&quot;), if the date be January or February in a leap year, remembering that every year, divisible by 4, is a Leap Year, excepting only the century-years, in &#x27;New Style&#x27;, when the number of centuries is not so divisible (e.g. 1800).

The final result gives the day of the week, &quot;0&quot; meaning Sunday, &quot;1&quot; Monday, and so on.
Examples:

;1783, September 18
17, divided by 4, leaves &quot;1&quot; over; 1 from 3 gives &quot;2&quot;; twice 2 is &quot;4&quot;.
83 is 6 dozen and 11, giving 17; plus 2 gives 19, i.e. (dividing by 7) &quot;5&quot;. Total 9, i.e. &quot;2&quot;
The item for August is &quot;8 from 10&quot;, i.e. &quot;2&quot;; so, for September, it is &quot;2 plus 31&quot;, i.e. &quot;5&quot; Total 7, i.e. &quot;0&quot;, which goes out.
18 gives &quot;4&quot;. Answer, &quot;Thursday&quot;.

;1676, February 23
16 from 18 gives &quot;2&quot;
76 is 6 dozen and 4, giving 10; plus 1 gives 11, i.e. &quot;4&quot;.
Total &quot;6&quot;
The item for February is &quot;3&quot;. Total 9, i.e. &quot;2&quot;
23 gives &quot;2&quot;. Total &quot;4&quot;
Correction for Leap Year gives &quot;3&quot;. Answer, &quot;Wednesday&quot;.

Dates before 1752 would in England be given Old Style with 25 March as the first day of the new year. Carroll&#x27;s method however assumes 1 January as the first day of the year, thus he fails to arrive at the correct answer, namely &quot;Friday&quot;.

Had he noticed that &quot;1676, February 23&quot; (with 25 March as New Year&#x27;s Day) is actually &quot;1677, February 23&quot; (with 1 January as New Year&#x27;s Day), he would have accounted for differing year numbers—just like George Washington&#x27;s birthday differs—between the two calendars. Then his method yields:

;1677 (corrected), February 23 
16 from 18 gives &quot;2&quot; 77 is 6 dozen and 5, giving 11; plus 1 gives 12, i.e. &quot;5&quot;. Total &quot;7&quot; The item for February is &quot;3&quot;. Total 10, i.e. &quot;3&quot; 23 gives &quot;2&quot;. Total &quot;5&quot;. Answer, &quot;Friday&quot;.

It is noteworthy that those who have republished Carroll&#x27;s method have failed to point out his error, most notably Martin Gardner.

In 1752, the British Empire abandoned its use of the Old Style Julian calendar upon adopting the Gregorian calendar, which has become today&#x27;s standard in most countries of the world. For more background, see Old Style and New Style dates.

===Methods in computer code===
==== Keith ====
In the C language expressions below, codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 are, respectively, integer variables representing the year (e.g., 1988), month (1–12) and day of the month (1-31). 

(d+=m&lt;3 ? y-- : y-2,23*m/9+d+4+y/4-y/100+y/400) % 7

In 1990, Michael Keith and Tom Craver published the foregoing expression that seeks to minimize the number of keystrokes needed to enter a self-contained function for converting a Gregorian date into a numerical day of the week. It returns codice_4 = Sunday, codice_5 = Monday, etc. This expression uses a less cumbersome month component than does Zeller&#x27;s algorithm.

Shortly afterwards, Hans Lachman streamlined their algorithm for ease of use on low-end devices. As designed originally for four-function calculators, his method needs fewer keypad entries by limiting its range either to A.D. 1905–2099, or to historical Julian dates. It was later modified to convert any Gregorian date, even on an abacus. On Motorola 68000-based devices, there is similarly less need of either processor registers or opcodes, depending on the intended design objective.

====Sakamoto&#x27;s methods====
The tabular forerunner to Tøndering&#x27;s algorithm is embodied in the following K&amp;R C function. With minor changes, it was adapted for other high level programming languages such as APL2. Posted by Tomohiko Sakamoto on the comp.lang.c Usenet newsgroup in 1992, it is accurate for any Gregorian date.

dayofweek(y, m, d) /* 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 12, y &gt; 1752 (in the U.K.) */
 static int t[] = {0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4};
 if ( m &lt; 3 )
 y -= 1;
 return (y + y/4 - y/100 + y/400 + t[m-1] + d) % 7;

It returns codice_4 = Sunday, codice_5 = Monday, etc.

Sakamoto also simultaneously posted a more obfuscated version:

dow(m,d,y) { y -= m&lt;3; return (y+y/4-y/100+y/400+&quot;-bed=pen+mad.&quot;[m]+d) % 7; }
This version encodes the month offsets in the string and as a result requires a computer that uses standard ASCII to run the algorithm correctly, reducing its portability. In addition, both algorithms omit type declarations, which is allowed in the original K&amp;R C but not allowed in ANSI C.

(Tøndering&#x27;s algorithm is, again, similar in structure to Zeller&#x27;s congruence and Keith&#x27;s short code, except that the month-related component is . Sakamoto&#x27;s is somewhere between the Disparate Gaussian and the Schwerdtfeger&#x27;s algorithm, apparently unaware of the expression form.)

=== Gauss&#x27;s method in MATLAB ===

<doc id="443443" wikidata="Q607082" url="?curid=443443" title="North Kesteven">
<text>North Kesteven is a local government district in Lincolnshire, England. The council is based in Sleaford. The district also contains the town of North Hykeham, which adjoins the neighbouring city of Lincoln, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Lincoln, West Lindsey, East Lindsey, Boston, South Holland, South Kesteven and Newark and Sherwood.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of three former districts from the administrative county of Kesteven, which were all abolished at the same time:
*East Kesteven Rural District
*North Kesteven Rural District
*Sleaford Urban District
The new district was named North Kesteven referencing its position within Kesteven, one of the three historic parts of Lincolnshire.

==Governance==

North Kesteven District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lincolnshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a change of allegiance and by-election in December 2023 the composition of the council was:
Four of the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Group of Unaligned Members&quot;, and the other two do not belong to any group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at the North Kesteven Council Offices at the corner of Kesteven Street and East Gate in Sleaford. The building had been built in 1856 as a row of houses called Lafford Terrace. It was purchased in 1925 by Kesteven County Council and converted to become its headquarters.

When local government was reorganised in 1974, it was originally planned to have North Kesteven&#x27;s offices in Bracebridge Hall on Newark Road in Lincoln, then the base of North Kesteven Rural District Council. In November 1973, a decision was taken to base it in The Hoplands in Sleaford, the base of East Kesteven Rural District Council. In January 1974 it was realised that this building was too small for the size needed, and the 81 rooms of Kesteven County Council&#x27;s headquarters in Sleaford would suit the new council instead. The Hoplands was subsequently demolished for housing.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 43 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Geography==

North Kesteven borders West Lindsey (along the Foss Dyke and the River Witham) and the city of Lincoln to the north, East Lindsey to the north-east (along the River Witham), Boston (borough) to the east, South Holland to the south-east, South Kesteven to the south, and the county of Nottinghamshire to the west.
North Kesteven covers an area of , of which 94% is classified as green space, which includes agricultural land and open space.

The district is characterised by small settlements and large areas of arable farmland. More than 80% of the population live in rural settlements or a market town. The two towns are Sleaford and North Hykeham, and the larger villages include Cranwell, Metheringham, Navenby, Ruskington and Waddington.

The district has two main RAF stations - RAF Cranwell (near Sleaford), and RAF Waddington (near Lincoln), both situated close to the A15, the main north–south road running through North Kesteven. The district is also home to RAF Digby, which lies between Sleaford and Metheringham. The former RAF Swinderby, which can be found adjacent to the A46 near the western edge of the district, closed in 1995.

==Demography==

The predominantly rural nature of the district has encouraged people to move to the area to take advantage of its quality of life, low crime rates, relatively low house prices, good-quality education and local heritage. This is reflected in research, which has shown 90% of residents are satisfied with their local area as a place to live and 82% of residents feel their area is a place where people from different backgrounds can get on well together.

North Kesteven is mostly rural in character but there are urban areas around the towns of North Hykeham and Sleaford. Sleaford forms an urban area with the nearby villages of Greylees, Holdingham, Leasingham and Quarrington, North Hykeham and Waddington form part of an urban area with the city of Lincoln. Within the district, 40% of the population live in the &quot;Lincoln Fringe&quot;, the area immediately surrounding Lincoln City. 72 parishes serve the district communities, comprising 58 parish councils, two town councils and 12 parish meetings.

The population of the district was 107,766 at the 2011 census.

==Education==

The district has comprehensive schools in North Hykeham, Branston and Welbourn. The area around Sleaford (including Ruskington) has selective schools. Other schools in the area include Kesteven and Sleaford High School and Branston Community College.

The district part funds The National Centre for Craft &amp; Design, in the Hub building in Sleaford. Adjacent to it are annex buildings of Grantham College, funded by the East Midlands LSC.

==Media==
In terms of television, East Lindsey is served by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcasting from the Belmont transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Lincolnshire, Lincs FM, and Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire.

&quot;Lincolnshire Echo&quot; is the local newspaper.

==Towns and parishes==

The entire district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Sleaford and North Hykeham take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes share grouped parish councils or have parish meetings instead of parish councils.

<doc id="443444" wikidata="Q2499345" url="?curid=443444" title="Dronfield">
<text>Dronfield is a town in North East Derbyshire, England, which includes Dronfield Woodhouse and Coal Aston. It lies in the valley of the River Drone between Chesterfield and Sheffield. The Peak District National Park is to the west. The name comes from the Old English &quot;Dranfleld&quot;, probably meaning an open land infested with drone bees.

The town existed before the 1086 Domesday Book, and has a 13th-century parish church. In 1662, Charles II granted the town a market, although this later ceased. The industrial history of the town includes coal mining, the wool trade, the production of soap and steel, and engineering. Today a range of manufacturing firms still operate in the town. The stadium to the north of the town is officially &quot;The Home of Football&quot;, providing the playing surface for Sheffield F.C., the world&#x27;s oldest football club.

Dronfield&#x27;s population increased in the post-war years from 6,500 in 1945 to 21,261 in the 2011 Census.

==History==
Dronfield was in existence before the 1086 Domesday Book, though little is known about its early history. It suffered after the Norman conquest when William the Conqueror sought to bring the North of England under control. Its name derives from the Old English &quot;drān&quot; and &quot;feld&quot;, meaning open land infested with drones (male bees).

The Church of St John the Baptist was built by 1135 when Oscot was rector and the parish of Dronfield covered Little Barlow, Coal Aston, Povey, Holmesfield, Apperknowle, Dore and Totley. The Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary was established in 1349 in the hall of the chantry priests. However, due to the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the subsequent suppression of the guilds and chantries in 1547, it became a local inn which still operates today as the Green Dragon Inn.

During the 16th century Dronfield with its sheep farmers had a significant number of families working in the wool trade, engaged in spinning and weaving and also the production and selling of cloth. Soaper Lane, being next to the river, was the centre of the soap-making and tanning industry in the town, with a dye works also situated there. In 1662 Dronfield was granted a market by Charles II, but in the 18th century, due to the proximity of Sheffield and Chesterfield, the market went into decline, however it is still held every Thursday in the rear car park of the civic centre on Farwater Lane.

Between the 16th and 19th centuries Dronfield grew around various industries, the most widespread of which was coal mining, with pits at Stubley being mentioned in the 16th century and a map of Hill Top in the 17th century showing some workings. Further mines were opened at Coal Aston in 1785 and Carr Lane in Dronfield Woodhouse in 1795. The town also benefited from trade with the lead mining and grindstone industries in the Peak District. The wealth of the Rotheram family, who became the Lords of the Manor of Dronfield, was based on the lead trade.

The Wilson-Cammell steelworks was built in the town in 1872–3, following the completion of the Midland Main Line through the town in April 1869. Bessemer steel was first blown at the site in March 1873 and the plant was soon capable of producing 700 tons - mostly as rails - every week. Dronfield became a boom town, but its prosperity was short-lived; although more efficient and profitable than other works in the Sheffield area, its site had limitations that could not compete with low-cost coastal locations, and in 1883 production moved from Dronfield to Workington in Cumberland (now Cumbria). Steelworkers and their families moved too. It is estimated that 1,500 townspeople made the trip to Workington. &#x27;Dronnies&#x27;, as the people of Workington called the newcomers, formed Workington AFC in 1888.

In 1993 Dronfield Henry Fanshawe School (formerly the &#x27;Dronfield School&#x27; and previously &#x27;Dronfield Grammar School&#x27;) suffered major damage when its 1960s system-built blocks were completely gutted by fire, requiring all firefighting resources from all nearby towns and Sheffield to control the blaze. The historic Victorian quadrangle and library, as well as the sixth-form block, survived. The remains of the modern school were subsequently demolished and mobile cabins were used as classrooms until 1996 when the school was rebuilt.

Dronfield Civic Hall was completely rebuilt in 1999.

==Geography==
Dronfield is sited in the valley of the River Drone in North East Derbyshire, England. The Drone is a small river that, after flowing through Dronfield, joins the Barlow Brook at Unstone, and then flows into the River Rother at Whittington Moor, Chesterfield.

Dronfield is situated roughly midway between the town of Chesterfield to the south and the city of Sheffield to the north, for which it is a commuter town. The A61 trunk road Dronfield–Unstone Bypass cuts through the town, although this is not directly accessible from the town centre itself. Instead a network of secondary roads serves local traffic: the B6054, B6056, B6057 and B6158. Dronfield is also served via rail through Dronfield railway station.

Dronfield covers an area of and has as neighbours the villages and hamlets of Unstone, Holmesfield, Barlow, Apperknowle, Hundall, Marsh Lane and Eckington.

Situated close to the Pennines and many of the beauty spots of Derbyshire, Dronfield also has easy access to the Peak District National Park just away. There are four conservation areas either wholly or partly within Dronfield&#x27;s parish area: Dronfield (adopted 1971), Coal Aston (1983), Dronfield Woodhouse (1990) and Moss Valley (1990); the first three cover the respective old village centres and are wholly within the parish, whereas Moss Valley covers a mixed landscape and is mostly outside the parish, to the northeast.

==Economy==
The town has a range of businesses, mainly located on the Callywhite Lane Industrial Estate at the eastern end of the town, and along Wreakes Lane and Stubley Lane northwest of the town centre. The main businesses in the town were originally associated with engineering trades, but over recent years have diversified. William Lees Iron Foundry, manufacturer of machinery parts, moved to Dronfield in 1870 and was responsible for major growth in the town at that time. Until the mid-1970s it specialised in production of malleable iron castings, though much production now is of spheroidal graphite iron.

Major companies with works in Dronfield include Henry Boot PLC, a property development and construction company (the divisions Henry Boot Construction Ltd and Banner Plant Ltd have regional offices in the town), Padley &amp; Venables Ltd, manufacturers of tools for use in drilling, tunnelling, mining, quarrying and construction/demolition, Land Instruments International, international designer and manufacturer of industrial and environmental monitoring instruments (in 2006 this was acquired by AMETEK Inc), and Gunstones Bakery, which was founded in Sheffield in 1862, moved to Dronfield in 1950, taken over by Northern Foods in 1971 and acquired by 2 Sisters in 2011; in 2013 it employed more than 1,400 people.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Dronfield&#x27;s civil parish (which includes Dronfield, Coal Aston, and Dronfield Woodhouse) had 9,388 dwellings, 9,267 households and a population of 21,261, of whom 10,333 were male and 10,928 female. 25.1% of the population were aged 65 or over (compared to 16.4% for England as a whole), and 16.1% were under the age of 16 (18.9% for England as a whole). 98.3% of Dronfield&#x27;s population were of white ethnicity (compared to 85.5% for England as a whole).

On 16 October 1975, the £6.5m A61 Dronfield–Unstone Bypass was opened running through the western side of the town, to allow easier access for travel between the larger populated areas of Sheffield to the north and Chesterfield to the south. To a certain extent the town is a dormitory community for workers in these settlements.

==Notable buildings==

Within Dronfield&#x27;s civil parish are 42 structures that are listed by Historic England for their historical or architectural interest. One structure - the parish church of St John the Baptist - is listed as Grade I, four structures - Aston End, Chiverton House, Dronfield Woodhouse Hall farmhouse and the building northeast of The Hall on High Street - are Grade II*, and the rest - including Dronfield Manor, the Peel Monument and several buildings in Church Street and High Street - are Grade II.

The parish church of St. John the Baptist dates from the late 13th to 14th century, with mid-16th-century alterations. It has ashlar and coursed rubble walls of coal measures sandstone, with graduated slate and lead roof coverings and an octagonal spire. Repairs were made in about 1819, with more alterations in 1855 and 1916. There are over 120 brasses and monuments, many of which line the floor in the chancel and nave.

Aston End is a medieval house with additions and alterations made in the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries. It is built in an L-plan with coursed rubble walls of coal measures sandstone and a stone slated roof. Chiverton House, originally called Dam Flatt House, dates from between 1692 and 1709 and has a flat symmetrical front with cross windows, a central gable and towers at each end. It was altered in 1712 and the 19th century, though not significantly. The attached boundary walls, gatepiers and railings form part of its listing. Dronfield Woodhouse Hall farmhouse was built in 1533, as suggested by dendrodating (by the University of Nottingham) and is a house of irregular layout, built from coursed squared coal measures sandstone with a stone slated roof. It was reworked extensively in the early 18th century, with further alterations in the 19th and 20th centuries. The building north-east of The Hall on High Street is a former farm outbuilding that dates from the late 17th century, but it also contains a significant amount of an earlier timber-framed building, possibly a medieval hall. It is built in an L-plan with walls of coursed squared coal measures sandstone and a stone slated roof. In 2004 it was in a poor state of repair and was gifted to the community; in 2015 it was restored and extended at a cost of more than £1.6 million, with over £1.25m provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund. It is now used as a heritage visitor centre and exhibition and community function space, with modern catering and cloakroom facilities.
The Peel Monument, situated on the town&#x27;s High Street, was built in 1854 out of gritstone as a tribute to Sir Robert Peel, to commemorate his repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The monument is very distinctive, and is often portrayed in images of the town.

Near to the Peel Monument on High Street is a 16th-century house known as The Cottage. It is believed that it was once owned by Lord Byron (1788–1824), although there is no proof that he was a Dronfield resident.

Run by three local teams, AFC Dronfield, Dronfield Town &amp; Dronfield RFU, the complex includes a state-of-the-art 3G pitch, 10 full-size pitches, changing facilities and a social area. It was officially opened by Sir Trevor Brooking and John Owen. Gosforth Fields is the home of Dronfield Rugby Club.

<text>The Monkey Sanctuary was founded in 1964 by Len Williams, father of classical guitarist John Williams, as a cooperative to care for rescued woolly monkeys. Based in Looe, Cornwall, England, it is home to woolly monkeys descended from the original residents, a growing number of capuchin monkeys rescued from the British pet trade and a small group of rescued Barbary macaques.

A colony of rare lesser horseshoe bats live in the cellar of Murrayton House, a 19th-century building that is the small on-site gift shop and accommodation for staff and volunteers. 

The Monkey Sanctuary is the flagship project of Wild Futures (UK registered Charity number 1102532).

<text>Miranda Otto (born 16 December 1967) is an Australian actress. She is the daughter of actors Barry and Lindsay Otto and the paternal half-sister of actress Gracie Otto. Otto began her acting career in 1986 at age 18 and appeared in a variety of independent and major studio films in Australia. She made her major film debut in &quot;Emma&#x27;s War&quot; in 1987 in which she played a teenager who moves to Australia&#x27;s bush country during World War II.

After a decade of critically acclaimed roles in Australian films, Otto gained Hollywood&#x27;s attention during the 1990s after appearing in supporting roles in the films &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; and &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;. She rose to fame in the early 2000s for playing Éowyn in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, based on the classic fantasy novel of the same name by English author J. R. R. Tolkien.

==Early life==
Otto was born on 16 December 1967 in Brisbane and was raised there and in Newcastle. She briefly lived in Hong Kong following her parents&#x27; divorce at age six. She spent weekends and holidays with her father in Sydney and developed an interest in acting through him.

During her childhood, Otto and her friends wrote scripts and designed costumes and flyers in their spare time. She appeared in several plays at the Nimrod Theatre, which attracted the attention of casting director Faith Martin. Subsequently, Otto received a role in the 1986 World War II drama &quot;Emma&#x27;s War&quot;.

She had wanted to be a ballerina but was forced to abandon this goal due to moderate scoliosis. Otto graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney in 1990. Prior to graduation, she appeared in minor film roles including &quot;Initiation&quot; (1987) and &quot;The 13th Floor&quot; (1988).

==Career==

===Early career===
Otto&#x27;s first post-graduation film role in 1991, as Nell Tiscowitz in &quot;The Girl Who Came Late&quot;, was her breakthrough role which brought her to the attention of the Australian film industry and the general public. In the film, directed by Kathy Mueller, she starred as a young woman who could communicate with horses. Her appearance garnered Otto her first Australian Film Institute nomination for the best actress award the following year.

Otto&#x27;s next role was in &quot;The Last Days of Chez Nous&quot; (1991), which portrayed the complex relationships between the members of an Australian family. The film earned Otto her second Australian Film Institute nomination, this time for the best supporting actress award.

In 1993, Otto co-starred with Noah Taylor in the sexually provocative comedy film &quot;The Nostradamus Kid&quot;, which was based on the memories of author Bob Ellis during the 1960s. Otto was drawn to the film because she was &quot;fascinated by the period and the people who came out of it&quot;. A small role in the independent film &quot;Sex Is a Four Letter Word&quot; followed in 1995.

In 1995, she began to doubt her career choice as she failed to get the parts for which she auditioned. She retreated to her home in Newcastle for almost a year, during which she painted her mother&#x27;s house. In 1996, director Shirley Barrett cast Otto as a shy waitress in the film &quot;Love Serenade&quot;. She played Dimity Hurley, a lonely young woman who competes with her older sister Vicki-Ann for the attention of a famous DJ from Brisbane. She starred in the 1997 films &quot;The Well&quot; and &quot;Doing Time for Patsy Cline&quot;. When Otto received the film script for &quot;The Well&quot;, she refused to read it, fearing that she would not get the part. Otto believed that she could not convincingly play the role of Katherine, who is supposed to be 18, as she was 30 at the time. The film, directed by Samantha Lang, starred Otto as a teenager involved in a claustrophobic relationship with a lonely older woman. &quot;The Well&quot; received mixed reviews; critic Paul Fisher wrote that Otto&#x27;s performance was not &quot;convincing&quot; as she was &quot;playing another repetitious character about whom little is revealed&quot;, while Louise Keller stated that Otto had delivered &quot;her best screen performance yet.&quot; Otto earned her third Australian Film Institute nomination for the film. Later that year, she co-starred with Richard Roxburgh in the drama &quot;Doing Time for Patsy Cline&quot;. The low-budget Australian film required Otto to perform country music standards and also received mixed reviews from film critics.

Soon after the release of &quot;The Well&quot; and &quot;Doing Time for Patsy Cline&quot;, magazines and other media outlets were eager to profile the actress. In 1997, Otto began dating her &quot;Doing Time for Patsy Cline&quot; co-star Richard Roxburgh. Her involvement with Roxburgh made her a regular subject of Australian tabloid magazines and media at the time, a role to which she was unaccustomed.

Otto&#x27;s next project was the romantic comedy &quot;Dead Letter Office&quot; (1998). The film was Otto&#x27;s first with her father, Barry, who makes a brief appearance. &quot;In the Winter Dark&quot;, directed by James Bogle, followed later that year. Otto played Ronnie, a pregnant woman recently abandoned by her boyfriend. The film was a critical success in Australia, and Otto was nominated for her fourth Australian Film Institute Award. A small role in &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998) led to further film roles outside of Australia, such as in Italy, where she co-starred as Ruth in the low-budget Italian film &quot;La volpe a tre zampe&quot; (&quot;The Three-legged Fox&quot;), produced in 2001 and broadcast for the first time on Italian television in March 2009.

===Hollywood===
Otto&#x27;s first Hollywood role was the suspense thriller &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; in 2000. She played Mary Feur, a mysterious next-door neighbour.

In 2001, she was cast as a naturalist in the comedy &quot;Human Nature&quot;. Writer Charlie Kaufman, impressed by her audition two years earlier for his film &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, arranged for Otto to audition and meet with the film&#x27;s director Michel Gondry. Critic Jeffrey M. Anderson criticised Otto&#x27;s French accent and wrote that she &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to mesh with what&#x27;s going on around her&quot;.

Also in 2001, Otto appeared in the BBC adaptation of Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot;, as a strong-willed American Southerner.

In 1999, Otto was cast as Éowyn in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, after Uma Thurman turned down the role. Director Peter Jackson cast her immediately after viewing the audition video she had filmed in Australia. For the role, Otto spent six weeks learning stunt choreography and horse riding. Otto&#x27;s character was introduced in the trilogy&#x27;s second film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; in 2002 and appeared in the third film, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, the following year. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy was a critical and financial success, and the third film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2004. Otto&#x27;s performance earned her an Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Otto&#x27;s next project was playing the lead in the Australian film &quot;Danny Deckchair&quot; (2003). She then took on the Australian television miniseries &quot;Through My Eyes: The Lindy Chamberlain Story&quot; (2004). The film is a drama that portrays the story of Lindy Chamberlain, who was wrongfully convicted in 1982 of killing her baby daughter, Azaria, in one of the country&#x27;s most publicized murder trials. Otto was cast as Chamberlain, and her husband, Peter O&#x27;Brien, was cast as prosecutor Ian Barker. She was drawn to the role because it provided her with the &quot;prospect of exploring an unconventional character.&quot; At the 2005 Logie Awards, Otto won Most Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series for her role.Director Steven Spielberg, impressed by Otto&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, called her to ask if she would play opposite Tom Cruise in the big-budget science fiction film &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (2005). Otto, pregnant at the time, believed she would have to turn down the role, but the script was reworked to accommodate her. After giving birth to her daughter, she took a rest from films to concentrate on motherhood and theatre roles in Australia.

In 2007, Otto starred as Cricket Stewart, the wife of a successful director, in the television miniseries &quot;The Starter Wife&quot;. That same year, she was cast in the American television series &quot;Cashmere Mafia&quot;. In the series she plays Juliet Draper, a successful female executive who must rely on her friends to juggle the demands of a career and family in New York City. Otto chose to star in the series because &quot;American television at the moment is so interesting and, particularly, the characters for women are so fantastic&quot; and she &quot;liked the idea of having a character over a long period of time and developing it.&quot; The series was cancelled in May 2008.

In 2013 Otto played the role of American poet Elizabeth Bishop opposite Glória Pires in Brazilian director Bruno Barreto’s &quot;Reaching for the Moon.&quot;

Otto starred opposite Stephanie Sigman and Anthony LaPaglia in the horror prequel &quot;&quot;, directed by David F. Sandberg. The film was released on 12 August 2017. She portrayed Zelda Spellman in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; (2018–2020).

On 31 May 2020, Otto joined Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot;, which reunites the cast of popular films through video-conferencing and promotes donations to non-profit charities, with her fellow &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; cast and crew members.
On 13 November 2023, Otto was announced for ABC drama series &quot;Ladies In Black.&quot; In 2024, Otto reprised her role as Éowyn from Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series in the anime fantasy film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim&quot;, a prequel directed by Kenji Kamiyama, to which she served as the narrator.

===Theatre===
Otto made her theatrical debut in the 1986 production of &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant&quot; for the Sydney Theatre Company. Three more theatrical productions for the Sydney Theatre Company followed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2002, she returned to the stage playing Nora Helmer in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; opposite her future husband Peter O&#x27;Brien. Otto&#x27;s performance earned her a 2003 Helpmann Award nomination and the MO Award for &quot;Best Female Actor in a Play&quot;.

Her next stage role was in the psychological thriller &quot;Boy Gets Girl&quot; (2005), in which she played Theresa, a journalist for a New York magazine. Otto committed to the project days before she found out she was pregnant. Robyn Nevin, the director, rescheduled the production from December 2004 to September 2005 so that Otto could appear in it.

==Personal life==
On 1 January 2003, she married actor Peter O&#x27;Brien, after the two met while performing in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. Otto and O&#x27;Brien have one child, a daughter. After the birth of her daughter, Otto limited her work to spend more time with her family at their home in Australia.

<text>The Paris Commune () during the French Revolution was the government of Paris from 1789 until 1795. Established in the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; just after the storming of the Bastille, it consisted of 144 delegates elected by the 60 divisions of the city. Before its formal establishment, there had been much popular discontent on the streets of Paris over who represented the true Commune, and who had the right to rule the Parisian people. The first mayor was Jean Sylvain Bailly, a relatively moderate Feuillant who supported constitutional monarchy. He was succeeded in November 1791 by Pétion de Villeneuve after Bailly&#x27;s unpopular use of the National Guard to disperse a riotous assembly in the Champ de Mars (17 July 1791). 

By 1792, the Commune was dominated by the Jacobins who were not in the Legislative Assembly due to the Self-Denying Ordinance. The new Commune meant that there was a revolutionary challenge to the Legislative Assembly, though its practical victories were limited and temporary. The violence provoked by the Jacobins and their excesses meant that the power of the Commune would end up being limited by increasing support for more moderate revolutionary forces until the Thermidorian Reaction and the execution of its leaders led to its disestablishment in 1795.

==Legislative origins and early history==
When Louis XVI ascended to the throne, he initially sought to establish better relations with a Paris that had felt subordinated by Versailles, and in 1774 he restored the Parliament of Paris – a court of nobles that had previously been abolished. However its powers were limited, and economic pressures meant that Versailles imposed austerity measures on the military and policing structures of Paris, incentivising disloyalty to the crown amongst soldiers and the police. This coupled with the perceived frivolity of royal spending encouraged popular anger, and radical pamphleteering and meetings started to become a key part of the Parisian bourgeois intellectual culture. Amidst this anger and the wider contemporary social upheavals in France, on 25 June 1789, 12 representatives from three different parts of the city voted in favour of creating a united Parisian municipality. Further reforms proposed by Nicolas de Bonneville aimed to create a Parisian Bourgeois Guard that would later become a National Guard (and was composed of 48,000 citizens) and a Commune that would have its own assembly which named itself &quot;L&#x27;Assemblée Générale des Électeurs de la Commune de Paris&quot; and was established on 11 July, just days before the Bastille was stormed on 14 July. On 20 July, each district of Paris elected 2 representatives, creating an assembly of 120 representatives who primarily came from the Third Estate. In Spring 1790 the departments of France were reorganized; the Paris Commune was divided up in 48 revolutionary sections of Paris and allowed to discuss the election of a new mayor. Louis XVI himself gave permission for this on 21 May 1790. Each section was granted its own popular militia, civil committee, and revolutionary committee. These sections acted as intermediaries between local populations (largely sans-culottes) and the legislative Paris Commune, and initially tended to deal with legal and civil concerns, but the sections were becoming increasingly radicalised and focused on political issues and struggles. On 24 February 1792 the &quot;Conseil Général de la Commune&quot; was installed: it consisted of 24 members, under whom were Etienne Clavière, Pierre-Joseph Cambon, Sergent-Marceau, René Levasseur and the King. Manuel was appointed as procureur of the commune, representing the King, gave a speech warning against anarchy. Early March the Paris Department was placed above the Commune in all matters of general order and security. According to Jan ten Brink it had the right to suspend the Commune&#x27;s decisions and to dispose of the army against her in case of emergency. 

The distinctions between an active and passive citizen were abolished by the Commune on 25 July 1792 as the Commune became increasingly Jacobin in its orientation, and ideas of full citizenship were beginning to take root. The theoretical basis for the establishment of the Commune meant that administrative power could be brought closer to the people in a revolutionary manner, and Paris could achieve localisation of revolutionaries to modernise the city and country, alongside creating a rational framework or administration that could function efficiently without agents of the state.

==Insurrection on 10 August==
In the earlier days of the Commune, Feuillants and then Girondin bourgeois Republican forces had dominated, but an ascendant Jacobin presence amongst the Parisian political class became increasingly militant in its desire to establish control of the Commune, and it succeeded in doing so formally as part of an organised seizure of power in August 1792. As a result of this, the Paris Commune became insurrectionary in the summer of 1792, essentially refusing to take orders from the Constitutional Cabinet of Louis XVI. On the night of 9 August 1792 (spurred by the issue of the Brunswick Manifesto on 25 July) a new revolutionary Commune, led by Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins and Jacques Hébert took possession of the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot;. Antoine Galiot Mandat de Grancey, the commander of the Paris National Guard and in charge of defending the Tuileries where the royal family resided, was assassinated and replaced by Antoine Joseph Santerre. The next day insurgents assailed the Tuileries. During the ensuing constitutional crisis, the collapsing Legislative Assembly of France was heavily dependent on the Commune for the effective power that allowed it to continue to function as a legislature. The insurrectionary commune had elected Sulpice Huguenin during the night as its first president. 

On 10 August and the following days, all 48 districts of Paris decided to elect representatives with unlimited powers (28 districts jointly made this decision on the eve of the assault on the Tuileries, whilst the remaining 20 joined them over the days that followed). The 11th district, covering an area which included Place Vendôme, elected Maximilien de Robespierre as its representative. At this time, 52 representatives formed the Departmental Council of the Commune. On 16 August, Robespierre presented a petition to the Legislative Assembly from the Paris Commune to demand the establishment of a provisional Revolutionary Tribunal that had to deal with the &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. On 21 August, it succeeded in dissolving the separate department of Paris; the Commune took its place, combining local and regional power under one body. The all-powerful Commune demanded custody of the royal family, imprisoning them in the Temple fortress. A list of &quot;opponents of the Revolution&quot; was drawn up, the gates to the city were sealed, and on 28 August the citizens were subjected to domiciliary visits, ostensibly in a search for muskets. A sharp conflict developed between the Legislative and the Commune and its sections. On 30 August the interim minister of Interior Roland and Guadet tried to suppress the influence of the Commune because the sections had exhausted the searches. The Assembly, tired of the pressures, declared the Commune illegal and suggested the organization of communal elections. On Sunday morning 2 September the members of the Commune, gathering in the town hall to proceed the election of deputies to the National Convention, decided to maintain their seats and have Rolland and Brissot arrested.

==September Massacres==
One of the bloodiest consequences of the Paris Commune was the September Massacres, and their exact origins continue to be a source of historical debate around the internal politics of the Paris Commune. Between 2 and 6 September, an estimated 1,100–1,600 people were killed by around 235 forces loyal to the Commune who had been responsible for guarding the prisons of Paris, and it is estimated that half of the prison population of Paris was massacred by the evening of 6 September. A culture of fear had emerged amidst the ongoing wars with Austria and Prussia, and the Jacobins had propagated a culture of conspiracy and revenge which singled out a potentially disloyal prison population; fearing that political prisoners and the many Swiss prisoners in Parisian jails would side with either an advancing foreign or counter-revolutionary army. Furthermore, the culture of revolutionary terror also prompted an opportunistic desire for revenge, and all of this coupled with the instability of the state and location of power, and the precarity of ordinary Parisian life fuelled a culture of extreme fear and paranoia that would eventually fuel the mass violence which was rationalised as a pre-emptive act. On 2 September, Danton gave a speech in the Legislative Assembly specifically singling out internal enemies, and called for volunteers to take arms against them and assemble together in Paris immediately. He insisted &quot;any one refusing to give personal service or to furnish arms shall be punished with death&quot;, and claimed that the salvation of France rested upon ordinary citizens taking up arms against potential traitors. The very next day the massacres began, and within 24 hours, 1,000 people had been killed. Jean-Paul Marat, heading the surveillance committee of the Commune, immediately started the mass dissemination of a notice imploring all patriots to eliminate counter-revolutionaries themselves as soon as possible, and Jean-Lambert Tallien, the secretary of the commune, called for an expansion of the mass action beyond Paris as a patriotic duty. A huge wave of violence followed, often organised through revolutionary sections, and the prison population was halved through the massacres. However, for all the rhetoric of dangerous political prisoners posing a threat to Paris, only a minority were political prisoners, and the vast majority were not political prisoners (72%), in fact some of them were children. The after-effects of the massacres were severe, and the assassination of Marat by Charlotte Corday (a Girondin sympathiser) on 13 July 1793, who blamed him for the violence, triggered an even further wave of radicalisation amongst Jacobins, as a cult of martyrdom emerged around him. Blame for the massacres remains controversial, but Danton and his inflammatory rhetoric is the most frequent figure emphasised by historians. However, Gwynne Lewis emphasises the &quot;sanguinary outbursts in the press&quot; promoted by Marat and notes that the massacres marked a watershed in a troubled history between the people and the political elite in a new combination of forces unleashed by revolution, counter-revolution, and the support of both amongst conflicting popular and elite forces. William Doyle further argues that Danton&#x27;s irresponsibility in provoking the violence served to devalue the popularity of the revolution on a local, domestic, and international level.

==Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793==
It called for the reinstatement of the Revolutionary Tribunal to try political opponents, and on 10 March 1793, the tribunal was restored. On 18 April the Commune announced an insurrection against the convention after the arrest of Jean-Paul Marat. Mid May Marat and the Commune supported Robespierre publicly and secretly. On 25 May, the Commune demanded that Hébert be released. The president of the Convention Maximin Isnard, who had enough of the tyranny of the Commune, threatened with the total destruction of Paris. &quot;If the Commune does not unite closely with the people, it violates its most sacred duty&quot;, Robespierre said. In the afternoon the Commune demanded the creation of a Revolutionary army of sansculottes in every town of France, including 20,000 men to defend Paris. The next day the Commune decided to create a revolutionary army of 20,000 men to protect and defend Paris. On Saturday 1 June the Commune gathered almost all day. Unsatisfied with the result the commune demanded and prepared a &quot;Supplement&quot; to the revolution for the next day. Hanriot was ordered to march his National Guard from the town hall to the National Palace. &quot;The armed force&quot;, Hanriot said, &quot;will retire only when the Convention has delivered to the people the deputies denounced by the Commune.&quot; The insurrection was organized by the Paris Commune and supported by Montagnards. 

The tribunal presided over the arrest, trial, and execution of the Girondins (see Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793), and the enactment of the law of General Maximum on 29 September 1793. It played an essential role in the revolutionary wars following 1793, forming militias and providing weaponry to many of the revolutionary armies during the Reign of Terror.

==Defeat of the Girondins==
The Commune took charge of routine civic functions but is best known for mobilizing the people towards direct democracy and insurrection when it deemed the Revolution to be in danger, as well as for its campaign to dechristianize the country. This campaign of dechristianization was spearheaded by many prominent figures within the Commune, such as the minister of war Jean-Nicolas Pache who sought to disseminate the profoundly anti-clerical work of Jacques Hébert by purchasing thousands of copies of his books and his radical newspaper Le Père Duchesne for free distribution to the public. The Hébertists amongst the Communards managed to successfully transform Notre-Dame and numerous other churches into Temples of Reason, further entrenching the Commune&#x27;s political commitment to the Cult of Reason. As the Commune became increasingly radical and Jacobin-dominated it aligned itself with radical left Montagnard ideas and policies, and was headed by Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and Hébert himself from November 1792 – some of the most extreme voices within the Commune – until their overthrow and eventual execution, along with 91 other members of the Commune, as part of the Thermidorian coup in July 1794.

The internal politics of the Commune and its political culture had a huge impact on the Insurrection of 31 May - 2 June 1793 and the fall of the Girondins. The Jacobin dominance of the Commune existed in strong tension with the much more moderate Girondins who dominated the Legislative Assembly. When the National Convention effectively replaced it in September 1792, the Girondins remained more powerful than the radical left Montagnards, and most of the Convention&#x27;s power and control over most of France remained in their hands. But by 1793, massive challenges to the legitimacy and reputation of the Girondins, such as the wars with Austria and Prussia, and the insurrectionary War in the Vendée began to destroy their popular support. The massacres of tens of thousands of people in the royalist Vendée uprising exposed just how deep the divides between urban and rural France were, how little practical control the Girondins had over a unified French republic, and how ineffective they were at holding true to democratic principles. France was effectively moving into the Civil War, and republicans were increasingly switching loyalty to the Montagnards. Amidst this crisis, in the Paris Commune, Marat sent a letter to throughout the provincial societies encouraging them to demand the recall of the appellants, which resulted in the Convention demanding he be put before a Revolutionary Tribunal. Outraged by this, most of the Parisian sections sent an outraged petition threatening the Girondins with an effective insurrection. In response to this, the Girondins launched a political assault on the Paris Commune as an institution, arresting Hébert for an inflammatory article he had published in his paper, and two other Jacobin Communards. This then triggered the declaration of an open Jacobin uprising, and Robespierre called upon the people to join in the revolt. A popular revolutionary army of around 20,000 men inside the Commune was formed, and the sections formed an insurrectionary committee. On 31 May, an uprising attempt began unsuccessfully, and the smaller than expected forces who gathered were unable to take the Convention in any meaningful way, and Jean-Francois Varlet accused Hébert and Dobson of weakness at the evening meeting of the Commune for the poorly planned attempt at ousting the Girondins. In response to this, the Commune gathered all day on 1 June, with the understanding that a Sunday uprising would mean a much better attendance of sans-culottes. After a full day of Communard planning, in the evening 40,000 troops surrounded the Convention, trapping the Girondins inside. They spent much of 2 June fiercely denouncing the Jacobins and the Paris Commune itself through speeches, arguing for its suppression, but as the Vendée fell to rebels, inspiring revolutionary outrage, Francois Hanriot ordered the National Guard to march on the convention and join those Communard forces to oust the Girondins who had lost the faith of republicans. The Convention, now having the National Guard around it, demanded that the ousting of the Girondins be blamed for France&#x27;s disintegration. Girondin deputies attempting to leave were arrested as the Convention was stormed, and the president of the Convention came out to plead with Hanriot to remove the troops, but he refused to do so, and under this pressure, the Convention itself ended upvoted for the arrest of those 22 leading Girondins – effectively destroying them as a political force. Marat and Couthon hailed Hanriot as a hero of the revolution, and he became seen as a hero of the Commune itself. This insurrection sparked by the Jacobins led to a new Montagnard governing force, the defeat of their Girondin enemies, and a completely new revolutionary government for France.

From 4 December 1793, the Commune of Paris and the revolutionary committees in the sections had to obey the law, the two Committees, and the convention. Within three weeks majority of the Committee of Public Safety decided that the ultra-left Hébertists would have to perish or their opposition within the committee would overshadow the other factions due to its influence in the Commune of Paris. 

In Summer 1794 the commune had to solve serious problems in the cemeteries because of the smell. On 23 July the Commune published a new maximum, limiting the wages of employees (in some cases by half) and provoking a sharp protest in the sections. On 27 July the Paris Commune gave orders to close the gates (and to ring the tocsin), and summoned an immediate meeting of the sections to consider the dangers threatening the fatherland. The Paris Commune was in league with the Jacobins to bring off an insurrection, asking them to send over reinforcements from the galleries, ‘even the women who are regulars there’. At around 10 p.m., the mayor Jean-Baptiste Fleuriot-Lescot appointed a delegation to go and convince Robespierre to join the Commune movement. After a whole evening spent waiting in vain for action by the Commune, losing time in fruitless deliberation, without supplies or instructions, the armed sections began to disperse.

==Thermidorian reaction and decline of the commune==
It was not until 1792 that the government had a formal cabinet in place, with the appointment of the Ministers of the French National Convention and the decision of the Commissioners of the Committee of Public Safety in 1794 to take charge of administrative departments, but the increased and consolidated power of the National Convention by 1794 now meant that they could challenge the insurrectionary and often hostile power of the Paris Commune. The ousting of Robespierre on 27 July 1794 (or 9 Thermidor year II in the revolutionary calendar), marked a huge organised counter-revolution against the radical left and Robespierre himself from the National Convention, and this naturally spelled trouble for the Paris Commune. When he was detained, the troops of the Paris Commune under Hanriot who were largely loyal to him organised an attempt to liberate him, which was in turn met by a counter-attack from Convention forces. They barricaded themselves into the Hotel de Ville, and on 28 July, the Convention forces succeeded in capturing Robespierre and the supporters who remained with him and executed them on the same day. Almost half of the Paris Commune (70 members) were executed on 29 July, as were many members of Jacobin club who had supported Robespierre - marking the beginning of the White Terror. With the execution of most of its members, the Commune was effectively a proxy of the National Convention, and subject to its direct rule. In response to this, Francois-Noel Babeuf and democratic militants associated with him - organised through a newly created Electoral Club - demanded the restoration of the Commune, but were unsuccessful in achieving their aims. The government of the republic was then succeeded by the French Directory in November 1795, formally ending the Commune, but its after-effects remained strong in the Parisian imagination, and the memory of the 18th Century Commune provided inspiration for the later Communards of the Paris Commune of 1871. However, with that later Commune of 1871, and his traumatic experiences of it, Hippolyte Taine writing in &quot;L&#x27;Origine de la France Contemporaine&quot; critically expressed the idea that there were strong reverberations of the 18th Century Commune, given how the 19th Century one restored institutions such as the Committee of Public Safety of 1793–1794.

==Women&#x27;s rights==
In 1791, the French Revolutionary Constitution attributed women to the category of &quot;passive&quot; citizens. Later, in 1793, the Jacobin Constitution did not allow women to vote. In 1795 some men lost their right to vote and the notion of &quot;passive&quot; citizenship was no longer in use, meaning that women lost their rights to be called citizens at all. The lack of rights was not unusual at the time for most working-class and middle-class women, however, it significantly influenced those more wealthy who liked to be involved and could exercise some influence through their salons or their husbands. 

The 1791 Constitution acknowledged that marriage was a civil contract, and with time divorce became a possibility. In the early 1790s women also gained an opportunity to legally inherit property. 

In general, there was an upheaval in women’s political involvement which started with the Parisian Women&#x27;s March on Versailles in 1789. Women were also involved in political discussions. For example, the Jacobin Club was for men only, however, their public meetings were open to everyone. Even though women did not speak on the stage, attending and voicing their support of or disagreement with certain speakers was a way to be politically proactive. 

Maximilien Robespierre, a member of the Jacobin Club, rose to power in 1792, and his popularity is largely attributed to his female supporters. Robespierre, however, was not an advocate for women’s rights, and a lot of contemporary female activists opposed his policies. Among those activists was Madame Roland who held salons for the Girondins, bourgeois republicans, around 1791. Her party’s political disagreements with Robespierre had led to their falling out. 

Olympe de Gouges, another prominent activist on the French political arena at the time, had published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen (1791) addressing the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. In her work, she criticised the revolution for not addressing gender inequality. Similar to Mme Roland, Olympe de Gouges was associated with the bourgeois republicans and has favoured the idea of the constitutional monarchy, causing her to criticise Robespierre and the Montagnards after the execution of Louis XVI. De Gouges’ criticism of the revolutionary movement in her writing and her affiliation to the Girondins led to her being convicted of treason and she was executed along with other party members (including Madame Roland) in November 1793. 

During the Reign of Terror activism began to decline. Most clubs and salons were closed in 1794 and women were prohibited from going into the Convention’s galleries.

<text>James Pollock (September 11, 1810 – April 19, 1890) was the 13th governor of Pennsylvania from 1855 to 1858.

== Political career ==
James Pollock graduated from the College of New Jersey at Princeton before setting up a law practice in his home community, in Milton, Pennsylvania. District attorney and judicial appointments followed and in 1844 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives where he served three successive terms.

As a freshman congressman, Pollock boarded in the same rooming house as another new congressman, Abraham Lincoln (who would later become the 16th President of the United States), and they soon developed a mutual respect and longstanding friendship.

Pollock was an early supporter of Samuel Morse and his idea for a telegraph and was instrumental in getting the United States Congress to appropriate a small amount to help build the first line. He was present in the room when the first message, &quot;What hath God wrought&quot; was received, ushering in a new age of telecommunication.

Pollock was also the first in congress to advocate the construction of a railroad across the continent, connecting newly acquired California with the east. In a speech in 1848 he said, &quot;At the risk of being considered insane, I will venture the prediction that, in less than twenty-five years from this evening, a railroad will be completed and in operation between New York and San Francisco, California.&quot; The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, four years inside the limit fixed by Mr. Pollock.

He returned to the judiciary in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Eighth District in 1850.

Pollock was nominated by the Whig Party for the governor&#x27;s race in 1854, amid controversy surrounding the Kansas–Nebraska Act. A large crowd attended his inaugural ceremonies on January 16, 1855. Historians believe this was the first Pennsylvania inaugural ceremony to be held in the &quot;open air.&quot; Attendance was estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 guests.

During his administration, Pennsylvania began to sell its publicly held railroads and canals, and he helped steer the state through the financial Panic of 1857. He chaired the Pennsylvania delegation to the Peace Conference of 1861, and was appointed by President Lincoln as Director of the Philadelphia mint that same year. While leading the United States Mint, he was instructed by the Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase in a letter to come up with suggestions for including &quot;the trust of our people in God&quot; in a motto on America&#x27;s coins. Pollock proposed a number of mottos, including &quot;Our Trust Is In God&quot; and &quot;God Our Trust,&quot; which Chase ultimately revised to &quot;In God We Trust&quot;. During his tenure at the Mint, the American Philosophical Society elected Pollock to membership in 1863.

Pollock was a member of the National Reform Association, which seeks to add a Christian amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The 1864 two-cent piece was the first coin with the approved motto and today all American coins are inscribed with &quot;In God We Trust.&quot;

James Pollock was also a trustee of Lafayette College from 1855 to 1876, and its president from 1863 onwards.

== Christian faith ==
James Pollock possessed a strong faith in God. Concurring with Secretary Chase&#x27;s instructions, in his 1863 report to the Secretary of the Treasury, he wrote,
&quot;We claim to be a Christian nation—why should we not vindicate our character by honoring the God of Nations…Our national coinage should do this. Its legends and devices should declare our trust in God—in Him who is &quot;King of Kings and Lord of Lords.&quot; The motto suggested, &quot;God our Trust,&quot; is taken from our National Hymn, the Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; The sentiment is familiar to every citizen of our country—it has thrilled the hearts and fallen in song from the lips of millions of American Freemen. The time for the introduction of this or a similar motto, is propitious and appropriate. &#x27;Tis an hour of National peril and danger—an hour when man&#x27;s strength is weakness—when our strength and our nation&#x27;s strength and salvation, must be in the God of Battles and of Nations. Let us reverently acknowledge his sovereignty, and let our coinage declare our trust in God.&quot;

Mr. Pollock served as Vice President of the American Sunday School Union from 1855 until his death in 1890. In that role he had the distinction of presiding over more mission business meetings than any man in the history of AMF other than the first president. Greatly respected by his fellow managers, it was recorded that &#x27;he was always eager to do his Lord&#x27;s business with earnestness and dispatch&#x27; and while conscious of the power of his masterful mind and loving heart, his fellows managers &#x27;most appreciated his depth of consecration.&#x27;

Pollock co-founded Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter and soup kitchen, in 1878 with notable fellow churchgoers John B. Stetson and John Wanamaker. What began as a simple cup of coffee and roll before church has grown to become the leading emergency shelter and largest indoor provider of meals in Philadelphia.

== Memorialization ==
Pollock has a residence area, dining commons, computer learning center, and campus road named for him on the University Park campus of Penn State University, the institution which received its charter during his term as governor. Included in a Model UN civil war committee.

<doc id="443476" wikidata="Q1477163" url="?curid=443476" title="Grange-over-Sands">
<text>Grange-over-Sands is a town and civil parish on the north side of Morecambe Bay in Cumbria, England, a few miles south of the Lake District National Park. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 4,114, increasing at the 2021 census to 4,279.
Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the town became administered as an urban district in 1894. Though the town remains part of the Duchy of Lancaster, since 2023 it has been administered as part of the Westmorland and Furness Council area.

Travelling by road, Grange-over-Sands is to the south of Kendal, to the east of Ulverston, to the east of Barrow-in-Furness and to the north of Lancaster.

==History==
The town developed in the Victorian era from a small fishing village and the arrival of the railway in 1857 made it a popular seaside resort on the north side of Morecambe Bay, across the sands from Morecambe. The &quot;over-Sands&quot; suffix was added in the late 19th or early 20th century by the local vicar, who was fed up with his post going to Grange in Borrowdale near Keswick.

In 1932 Grange Lido was built on the seafront, and remained in use until 1993, in 2011 it was listed Grade II. There is a campaign to restore and re-open it (as 2019).

The River Kent used to flow past the town&#x27;s mile-long promenade but its course migrated south, away from Grange. The sands or mudflats with dangerous quicksands became a grass meadow now grazed by small flocks of sheep. Following sustained easterly winds in the early part of 2007, the river began to switch its course back across the bay.

==Amenities==

===Sanatorium===
The clean, sea air and local spring water were believed to be of benefit to tuberculosis sufferers, and in 1891 one of the first sanatoriums in the country was established at Meathop.

===Swimming pool===
In 2003 a new public swimming pool, the &quot;Berners Pool&quot;, was opened. The pool, which cost £3.5 million, was designed by architects Hodder Associates and won a RIBA Design Award in 2004. However it suffered from high running costs and structural problems and was closed in 2006 when the Community Trust which ran it became insolvent. It was subsequently demolished in 2013 and later replaced by affordable housing.
A new pool and leisure centre was subsequently planned as part of the redevelopment of the Grange Lido site. However this development was opposed as it would have involved filling in the Grade II listed lido. As of September 2018, the future of the site was still being debated.

===Grange Lido===
In January 2019, it was announced that the derelict Grade II listed coastal lido would be refurbished and reopened to the public, but not as a swimming pool.

In August 2019, the derelict Grange Lido opened for public tours.

===Media===
A local free newspaper, &quot;Grange Now&quot;, which reports on local news, is published monthly and is delivered to over 5,000 homes on the Cartmel Peninsula.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter, and the Lancaster relay transmitter. 

The town is served by both BBC Radio Cumbria on 96.1 FM and BBC Radio Lancashire on 104.5 FM. Other radio stations including Heart North West on 96.9 FM, Smooth Lake District on 100.1 FM and community online stations, Lake District Radio and Bay Trust Radio.

==Governance==
Grange-over-Sands is part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency, of which Tim Farron is the current MP representing the Liberal Democrats.

Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency.

For Local Government purposes, it is in the &quot;Grange and Cartmel Ward&quot; of the Westmorland and Furness Council area. Prior to this it was in the &quot;Grange Ward&quot; of South Lakeland District Council and the &quot;Grange Division&quot; of Cumbria County Council.

The town also has its own Town Council; &quot;Grange-over-Sands Town Council&quot;.
==Education==
There is one primary school, the Grange-over-Sands Church of England Primary School. There is no secondary school, so most pupils attend the nearby schools in either Cartmel or Milnthorpe.

==Tourism==

The town is a centre for tourists exploring the southern Lakeland fells, and is home to a number of hotels, bed &amp; breakfasts and holiday properties. Within the town itself, there is an ornamental duck pond and a traffic-free promenade.

Adjacent to Grange are Lindale, to the north-east, Cartmel to the north-west, with its priory to which the village was once the &#x27;grange&#x27; or farm, and Allithwaite to the west. Also nearby is a country house, Holker Hall, which was built on land that once belonged to the priory. The stables at Holker Hall housed the Lakeland Motor Museum until its move to Backbarrow in 2010.

In December 2019, National Geographic published an article called &quot;How to spend a weekend on the Cumbrian coast,&quot; in which it recommended that tourists should &quot;Resist the lure of the Lake District and instead trace England’s northwest coastline by road or rail, savouring epicurean discoveries and sandy hikes along the way.&quot; The article included a recommendation for visiting Grange-over-Sands.
==Hampsfield Fell==

Above the town is Hampsfield Fell (generally abbreviated to Hampsfell), crowned by &#x27;Hampsfell Hospice&#x27;, a sturdy limestone tower monument built in 1846 by the vicar of Cartmel. This offers shelter in bad weather and extensive views in better conditions. Over the door, which faces east, there is an inscription from Homer - &#x27;ΡΟΔΟΔΑΚΤΥΛOΣ EΩΣ&#x27; - (RODODAKTYLOS EOS &quot;rosy-fingered&quot; Dawn) - whilst inside are painted boards commemorating its construction, praising the view and welcoming visitors. On the roof, which is accessible by a crude flight of stone stairs, is a crude alidade or compass pointer allowing the easy identification of nearby peaks and sights of interest. Hampsfell is the subject of a chapter of Wainwright&#x27;s book &quot;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&quot;. It reaches . The summit of Hampsfell is surrounded by several flat, incised areas of limestone pavement.
==Transport==
Grange-over-Sands railway station, which serves the town, was opened by the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway on 1 September 1857 and is now served by the Furness Line, giving connections to and to the west, and , , Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport to the east.

The main road access is the A590, which runs between the M6 and Barrow-in-Furness. Before the building of the railway, the main way of reaching Grange was the road across the Sands of Morecambe Bay from Hest Bank.

<text>Semolina is the name given to roughly milled durum wheat mainly used in making pasta and sweet puddings. The term &quot;semolina&quot; is also used to designate coarse millings of other varieties of wheat, and sometimes other grains (such as rice or maize) as well.

==Etymology==
Semolina is derived from the Italian word , 1790–1800; alteration of Italian &#x27;, equivalent to &quot;semol(a&quot;) &quot;bran&quot; () + &quot;-ino&quot; diminutive suffix. Of Semitic origin; Arabic root is samid (سميد) and Hebrew root &quot;smd&quot; &quot;to grind into groats&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; &#x27;).

==Production==

Modern milling of wheat into flour is a process that employs grooved steel rollers. The rollers are adjusted so that the space between them is slightly narrower than the width of the wheat kernels. As the wheat is fed into the mill, the rollers flake off the bran and germ while the starch (or endosperm) is cracked into coarse pieces in the process. Through sifting, these endosperm particles, the semolina, are separated from the bran. The semolina is then ground into flour. This greatly simplifies the process of separating the endosperm from the bran and germ, as well as making it possible to separate the endosperm into different grades because the inner part of the endosperm tends to break down into smaller pieces than the outer part. Different grades of flour can thus be produced.

==Types==
Semolina made from hard durum wheat (&quot;Triticum turgidum&quot; subsp. &quot;durum&quot;) is pale yellow in color. It may be milled either coarse or fine, and both are used in a wide variety of sweet and savory dishes, including many types of pasta. 
Semolina made from common wheat (&quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;) is beige in color. In the United States, it is called farina (not to be confused with Italian &quot;farina&quot;, which is common-wheat flour), and it is used more often for desserts than for savory foods. On the Indian subcontinent, common-wheat semolina may be milled either coarse or fine, and both are used in a wide variety of both sweet and savory dishes. Common names in other languages include:
* Italian: &quot;semola di grano duro&quot;; coarse (no descriptor), fine &quot;rimacinata&quot;
* Greek: &quot;simigdáli&quot; σιμιγδάλι; coarse &quot;chondró&quot; χονδρό, fine &quot;psiló&quot; ψιλό
* Arabic: &quot;samīd&quot; سميد; coarse &quot;ḵašin&quot; خشن, fine &quot;nāʿim&quot; ناعم
* Turkish: &quot;irmik&quot;; coarse &quot;iri&quot;, fine &quot;ince&quot;
* Urdu: &quot;sooji&quot; سوجی
* Hindustani: &quot;baṃsī ravā&quot;, &quot;bansi rava&quot; बंसी रवा (milled only coarse, not fine)
* Assamese: &quot;sūjī&quot; চুজি
* Bangla: &quot;śūjī&quot; সুজি
* Gujarati: &quot;sōjī&quot; સોજી
* Hindustani: &quot;sūjī&quot; सूजी/سوجی, or &quot;ravā&quot; रवा; coarse &quot;moṭī&quot; मोटी, fine &quot;bārīk&quot; बारीक
* Kannada: &quot;rave&quot; ರವೆ
* Malayalam: &quot;ṟava&quot; റവ
* Dhivehi: &quot;ravā&quot; ރަވާ
* Marathi: &quot;ravā&quot; रवा
* Nepali: &quot;sūjī&quot; सूजी
* Punjabi: &quot;sūjī&quot; ਸੂਜੀ
* Sinhala: &quot;rulang&quot; රුලං
* Tamil: &quot;ravai&quot; ரவை
* Telugu: &quot;ravva&quot; రవ్వ

Broadly speaking, meal produced from grains other than wheat may also be referred to as semolina, e.g., rice semolina and corn semolina. Corn semolina is commonly called grits in the United States.

==Dishes==
===Savory===
In Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovenia, Romania, Slovakia and Croatia, (durum) semolina is known as &quot;&quot; (a word related to &quot;grits&quot;) and is mixed with egg to make &quot;Grießknödel&quot;, which can be added to soup. The particles are fairly coarse, between 0.25 and 0.75 millimeters in diameter. It is also cooked in milk and sprinkled with chocolate to be eaten as breakfast.

In Italy, (durum) semolina is used to make a type of soup by directly boiling fine semolina in vegetable or chicken broth. Semolina can also be used for making a type of gnocchi called &quot;gnocchi alla romana&quot;, where semolina is mixed with milk, cheese and butter to form a log, then cut in discs and baked with cheese and bechamel.

Semolina is a common food in West Africa, especially among Nigerians. It is eaten as either lunch or dinner with stew or soup. It is prepared just like eba (cassava flour) or fufu with water and boiled for 5 to 10 minutes.

In much of North Africa, durum semolina is made into the staple couscous and different kinds of flat breads like m&#x27;semen, kesra, khobz and other.

In Pakistan and North India semolina is called sooji, and in South India, rava. Semolina is used to make savory South Indian foods, such as rava dosa, rava idli, rava kitchri and upma. It is used to coat slices of fish before it is pan-fried in oil. Rotis can also be made from semolina.

===Sweet===
In the UK, the flour is mixed with hot milk, sugar and vanilla to make a warm pudding dessert. It has fallen out of favour in recent times due to the slight coarseness that the grains retain. At one time it was a staple pudding served in school lunches.

In Austria, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia, Romania, Croatia, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, common wheat semolina is called &#x27; in German, but is often referred to as &#x27;). It is often cooked with milk and sugar or cooked with just milk and then topped with sugar, cinnamon, Ovaltine or other sweet toppings. A dollop of butter is also often added. This dish is called &quot;Grießkoch&quot; in Austria, &#x27; in Germany, and semolina pudding in English. &#x27; consists of semolina mixed with whipped egg whites, and sometimes fruit or nuts, and then baked in the oven.

A baked dish containing semolina called &quot;migliaccio&quot; is found in the Neapolitan tradition in Italy. Migliaccio is a mixture of ricotta, vanilla and citrus peel, similar to the filling in sfogliatelle, with added semolina flour to obtain a simple, firm cake.

In Slovakia, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Belarus, Israel, and Russia, it is eaten as a breakfast porridge, sometimes mixed with raisins and served with milk. In Swedish, it is known as &#x27;, or boiled together with blueberries, as &#x27;. In Sweden, Estonia, Finland, and Latvia, semolina is boiled together with juice from berries and then whipped into a light, airy consistency to create &#x27; (Swedish name), also known as &#x27; (Finnish name) or &#x27; (Estonian name) or &#x27; (Latvian name). This dessert often eaten in the summer.

In the Middle East and North Africa, &quot;basbousa&quot; (also called &quot;harisa&quot; in some varieties of Arabic) is a sweet semolina cake soaked in fragrant syrup and frequently topped with nuts. In North Africa, it is also used to make harcha, a kind of griddle cake often eaten for breakfast, commonly with jam or honey. Baghrir, a North African pancake, is also made with semolina or flour that is served for breakfast.

In Indian subcontinent, semolina (called Rava, suji or shuji) is used for such sweets as halwa and rava kesari. Semolina vermicelli is also used to make a pudding called seviyan. In Nepal, semolina is called suji and is used for preparing sweet dishes such as haluwa or puwa. In Myanmar (Burma), semolina (called shwegyi) is used in a popular dessert called sanwin makin. In Sri Lanka semolina is called &quot;rulan&quot; and used to make creamy porridge and a sweet confectionery called &quot;rulan aluwa&quot;.

Halwa is sometimes made with semolina cooked with sugar, butter, milk, or pine nuts. It is a popular treat in Turkey (&quot;helva&quot;), Greece, (&quot;halvas&quot;), Cyprus (&quot;halvas&quot;), Bulgaria (&quot;halva&quot;), Iran (&quot;halva&quot;), Pakistan (&quot;halva&quot;), Bangladesh (&quot;halua&quot;), Palestine (&quot;halawa&quot;), and Israel (&quot;khalva&quot;). In Turkey, sweet dishes called revani, şekerpare and şambali are made with semolina.
In Greece, the dessert galaktoboureko is made by making a custard from the semolina and then wrapping it in phyllo sheets. In Cyprus, the semolina may be mixed also with almond cordial to create a light, water-based pudding.

==In baking==
As an alternative to corn meal, semolina can be used to flour the baking surface to prevent sticking. In bread making, a small proportion of durum semolina added to the usual mix of flour is said to produce a tasty crust.

<text>Abbott Joseph Liebling (October 18, 1904 – December 28, 1963) was an American journalist who was closely associated with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 1935 until his death. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary called him &quot;a critic of the daily press, a chronicler of the prize ring, an epicure and a biographer of such diverse personages as Gov. Earl Long of Louisiana and Col. John R. Stingo.&quot; He was known for dubbing Chicago &quot;The Second City&quot; and for the aphorism &quot;Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.&quot; Liebling&#x27;s boxing book &quot;The Sweet Science&quot; was named the greatest sports book of all time by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Liebling was a connoisseur of French cuisine, a subject he wrote about in &quot;Between Meals: An Appetite For Paris&quot;. Pete Hamill, editor of a Library of America anthology of Liebling&#x27;s writings, said &quot;He was a gourmand of words, in addition to food... he retained his taste for &#x27;low&#x27; culture too: boxers and corner men, conmen and cigar store owners, political hacks and hack operators. They&#x27;re all celebrated in [his] pages.&quot;

==Early life==

Liebling was born into a well-off family on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where his father worked in New York&#x27;s fur industry. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Austria and his mother, Anna Adelson Slone, came from a Jewish family in San Francisco. After early schooling in New York, Liebling was admitted to Dartmouth College in the fall of 1920. His primary activity during his undergraduate career was as a contributor to the &quot;Jack-O-Lantern&quot;, Dartmouth&#x27;s nationally known humor magazine. He left Dartmouth without graduating, later claiming he was &quot;thrown out for missing compulsory chapel attendance.&quot; He then enrolled in the School of Journalism at Columbia University.

==Career==

===Early years===

After finishing at Columbia, he began his career as a journalist at the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot; of Providence, Rhode Island. He worked briefly in the sports department of&quot; The New York Times&quot;, from which he supposedly was fired for listing the name &quot;Ignoto&quot; (Italian for &quot;unknown&quot;) as the referee in results of games.

In 1926, Liebling&#x27;s father asked if he would like to suspend his career as a journalist to study in Paris for a year.

Liebling later wrote that the unsuitable proposed marriage was a fiction intended less to swindle his father than to cover his own pride at being the recipient of such generosity.
Thus in summer 1926, Liebling sailed to Europe where he studied French medieval literature at the Sorbonne in Paris. By his own admission his devotion to his studies was purely nominal, as he saw the year as a chance to absorb French life and appreciate French food. Although he stayed for little more than a year, this interval inspired a lifelong love for France and the French, later renewed in his war reporting. He returned to Providence in autumn 1927 to write for the &quot;Journal&quot;. He then moved to New York, where he proceeded to campaign for a job on Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;New York World&quot;, which carried the work of James M. Cain and Walter Lippmann and was known at the time as &quot;the writer&#x27;s paper&quot;. In order to attract the attention of the city editor, James W. Barrett, Liebling hired an out-of-work Norwegian seaman to walk for three days outside the Pulitzer Building, on Park Row, wearing sandwich boards that read &quot;Hire Joe Liebling&quot;. It turned out that Barrett habitually used a different entrance on another street, and never saw the sign. He wrote for the &quot;World&quot; (1930–31) and the &quot;World-Telegram&quot; (1931–35).

===&quot;The New Yorker&quot;===

Liebling joined &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1935. His best pieces from the late thirties are collected in &quot;Back Where I Came From&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Telephone Booth Indian&quot; (1942).

During World War II, Liebling was active as a war correspondent, filing many stories from Africa, England, and France. His war began when he flew to Europe in October 1939 to cover its early battles, lived in Paris until June 10, 1940, and then returned to the United States until July 1941, when he flew to Britain. He sailed to Algeria in November 1942 to cover the fighting on the Tunisian front (January to May 1943). His articles from these days are collected in &quot;The Road Back to Paris&quot; (1944). He participated in the Normandy landings on D Day, and he wrote a memorable piece concerning his experiences under fire aboard a U.S. Coast Guard-staffed landing craft off Omaha Beach. He afterwards spent two months in Normandy and Brittany, and was with the Allied forces when they entered Paris. He wrote afterwards: &quot;For the first time in my life and probably the last, I have lived for a week in a great city where everybody was happy.&quot; Liebling was awarded the Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French government for his war reporting.

Following the war he returned to regular magazine fare and for many years after he wrote a &quot;New Yorker&quot; monthly feature called &quot;Wayward Press&quot;, in which he analyzed the US press. Liebling was also a fan of boxing, horse racing and food, and frequently wrote about these subjects.

In 1947 he published &quot;The Wayward Pressman&quot;, a collection of his writings from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other publications.

===Hiss case===

During the late 1940s, he vigorously criticized the House Un-American Activities Committee and became friends with Alger Hiss.

In 1949, he published &quot;Of Mink and Red Herring&quot;, a &quot;second book of critical articles on New York newspapers&quot;, which included his critique of the &quot;scurrilous journalism&quot; applied to victims of &quot;Elizabeth Bentley and her ilk&quot;. On July 23, 1949, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an article by Liebling entitled &quot;Spotlight on the Jury&quot; in which he opened by stating &quot;The trial of Alger Hiss, which produced some of the best and some of the worst newspaper copy of our time&quot; and concluded &quot;This sort of thing obviously and apparently lessens the chance of a fair trial next time. Perhaps the secrecy of the jury room, like that of the voting booth, should be protected by law.&quot;

===Last years===

In 1961, Liebling published &quot;The Earl of Louisiana&quot;, originally published as a series of articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in which he covered the trials and tribulations of the governor of Louisiana, Earl K. Long, the younger brother of the Louisiana politician Huey Long.

==Personal life==

He married Ann Beatrice McGinn, a former movie theater ticket taker he had met while she was working in Providence, Rhode Island, on July 28, 1934. McGinn suffered from either manic depression or schizophrenia, which caused her to have hallucinations and go into fugue states. Her illness required many lengthy and expensive hospital stays and when she was out of the hospital, she was often heavily sedated. Both Liebling and McGinn committed infidelities during their marriage.

In 1946 he and his wife separated. They divorced on August 30, 1949, in Reno, Nevada. Two days later he married Lucille Spectorsky, the ex-wife of Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in Virginia City, Nevada. Spectorsky was described by Liebling&#x27;s friend and &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor Gardner Botsford as &quot;a big blonde from rural Kentucky, amiable if dumb.&quot; Liebling and Spectorsky divorced in 1959 and he married author Jean Stafford the same year.

On December 19, 1963, Liebling was hospitalized for bronchopneumonia. He died on December 28 at Mount Sinai Hospital, and was buried in the Green River Cemetery, East Hampton, New York.

==Legacy==

* Liebling&#x27;s papers are archived at Cornell University.
* In 1995, the Boxing Writers Association of America created the A.J. Liebling Award. The first class of honorees included longtime Washington, D.C. sportswriters Sam Lacy and Shirley Povich.
* In 2008, the Library of America published a volume of Liebling&#x27;s World War II writings. The book includes the essays &quot;The Road Back to Paris&quot;, &quot;Mollie and Other War Pieces&quot;, &quot;Normandy Revisited&quot;, as well as his uncollected war journalism. In 2009, this was followed by the publication of &quot;The Sweet Science and Other Writings&quot;, edited by Pete Hamill.
* The journalist and sportswriter W. C. Heinz called Liebling &quot;the best essayist.&quot;
* The Library of America selected Liebling&#x27;s 1955 &quot;New Yorker&quot; story &quot;The Case of the Scattered Dutchman&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime writing, published in 2008.
* Friend and fellow &quot;New Yorker&quot; writer Joseph Mitchell inherited Liebling&#x27;s book library after his death, and recalls Liebling&#x27;s once having used bacon as a bookmark.
* A later &quot;New Yorker&quot; writer, Anthony Lane, wrote favorably of Liebling, whose &quot;delicately gluttonous writings on food keep wandering off (when he can tear himself away) into such equally pressing areas Paris, boxing and sex.&quot;
* Anthony Bourdain named &quot;Between Meals&quot; as one of his favorite books, adding &quot;He was an enthusiastic lover of food and wine, very knowledgeable but never a snob. It&#x27;s the benchmark for great food writing.&quot;

His writing was often memorable, as was his eating, and he nicely combined the two passions in &quot;Between Meals&quot; (1962), of which the following extract gives a taste:

<text>William Fisher Packer (April 2, 1807September 27, 1870) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as the 14th governor of Pennsylvania from 1858 to 1861.

==Early and personal life==
Packer was born in Howard, Pennsylvania to James and Charity Packer. When William was seven years old, his father died, leaving him and his four siblings to help run the house.

At the age of 13 he began work as a printer&#x27;s apprentice at the Sunbury Public Inquirer and later at the Bellefonte Patriot. He also worked as a journeyman at Simon Cameron&#x27;s newspaper the Pennsylvania Intelligencer in Harrisburg.

Packer studied law in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, under future member of Congress Joseph Biles Anthony but did not practice, choosing instead to stay in the newspaper business. In 1829 he purchased a controlling share and became the editor of the &quot;Lycoming Gazette&quot; which he published until 1836. While working at the Lycoming Gazette, he began an early foray into politics as a major supporter of the construction of the West Branch of the Pennsylvania Canal. The state legislators in Philadelphia had opposed funding the construction and Packer penned an address to Philadelphia to raise public support for the project. The campaign worked and the Philadelphia delegation reversed their position to support the canal.

Packer married Mary W. Vanderbilt on December 24, 1829. The couple had ten children.

==Entry into politics==
Packer&#x27;s support for the canal did not go unnoticed and in 1832, he was appointed by the Canal Commission to serve as Superintendent of the canals. The position was abolished in 1835 and Packer spent most of that year working for the re-election of Governor George Wolf and running for the Pennsylvania State Senate. A schism in the Democratic Party cost Wolf re-election and Packer a Senate seat.

In 1836, Packer co-founded The Keystone, a Democratic newspaper published in Harrisburg. Packer, through the Keystone, was a supporter of David R. Porter for Governor against Joseph Ritner in the election of 1838. His support of Porter&#x27;s successful bid helped him earn an appointment to the Board of Canal Commissioners, a powerful post at the time. After he was re-elected, Porter appointed Packer to the post of Pennsylvania Auditor General in 1842.

After an unsuccessful bid for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1845, Packer won a seat in Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1847 and served as Speaker of the House in 1848 and 1849. Packer won re-election in 1848 and then served as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 12th district from 1851 to 1852.

In the State Senate, Packer was an ardent supporter of railroad development in Central Pennsylvania, working towards the establishment of the Susquehanna Railroad. At the time, state policy was to restrain railroad development in southern Pennsylvania which would benefit Baltimore rather than Philadelphia. The act to authorize the railroad connected the York and Cumberland Railroad to cities like Williamsport and Sunbury and increased their access to regional trade. In 1852, Packer became the first President of the Susquehanna, stepping aside after the line was consolidated into the Northern Central Railway.

During the 1856 Presidential Election, friend and fellow Pennsylvanian James Buchanan ran for the Democratic nomination against incumbent Franklin Pierce and Senator Stephen Douglas. Packer worked hard for his nomination and election. Buchanan won the nomination at the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, and went on to win the Presidency over Republican John C. Frémont and Know Nothing candidate and former President Millard Fillmore.

==Governor==
In 1857, Packer was nominated as the Democratic Party Candidate for Governor. He was opposed by David Wilmot, author of the Wilmot Proviso which aimed to ban the expansion of slavery to territories acquired from Mexico, and Isaac Hazlehurst of the Native American Party. The Panic of 1857 had crippled the nation&#x27;s economy, including the Pennsylvania iron industry. With strong support for tariffs in more normal times, the Panic increased Pennsylvania&#x27;s support for high tariffs, a stance which hurt the pro-free trade Wilmot. The question of the day, however, remained the issue of slavery in Kansas. Packer forwarded a letter to his friend, President Buchanan, supporting the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but opposing an expansion of slavery in that state without a free and open process. The split of the Republicans and Know Nothings made it difficult to defeat the united Democrats and Packer swept into office.

A large crowd attended his inaugural ceremonies on January 19, 1858.

In dealing with the economic crisis caused by the Panic, Packer vehemently blamed banks and the free issue of paper money over gold and silver coinage. As part of a recovery plan, the Governor approved legislation to requiring state banks to limit the issue of paper currency to amounts covered by real security deposited with the state.

In 1859, Packer sought to end the state&#x27;s involvement in construction and management of canals and railroads, selling off the state&#x27;s investments to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad.

Governor Packer was a proponent of public schools and supported the new public school system with funds for teacher training. Packer also used his veto power to stop attacks on the new public education system by forces in the legislature.

As his term came to an end, southern states had begun seceding from the union. Packer recommended that the nation&#x27;s differences be addressed in a national convention. He opposed secession and, in his final address to the General Assembly, he stated, &quot;It is therefore clear, that there is no Constitutional right of secession. Secession is only another form of nullification. Either, when attempted to be carried out by force, is rebellion, and should be treated as such, by those whose sworn duty it is to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States.&quot;

Packer retired from public life after the end of his term and died September 27, 1870, in Williamsport. He is interred at Williamsport Cemetery.

<text>Blond () or blonde (), also referred to as fair hair, is a human hair color characterized by low levels of eumelanin, the dark pigment. The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some yellowish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish &quot;strawberry&quot; blond or golden-brownish (&quot;sandy&quot;) blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). Occasionally, the state of being blond, and specifically the occurrence of blond traits in a predominantly dark or colored population are referred to as blondism.

Because hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in people living in or descended from people who lived in Northern Europe, and may have evolved alongside the development of light skin that enables more efficient synthesis of vitamin D, due to northern Europe&#x27;s lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among the native populations of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Fiji; among the Berbers of North Africa; and among some Asian people.

In Western culture, blonde hair has long been associated with beauty and vitality. Aphrodite, the ancient Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blonde hair. In the Greco-Roman world, blonde hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using saffron dyes in order to attract more customers. The Greeks stereotyped Thracians and slaves as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the Celts and the Germanic peoples to the north. In the ancient Greek world, &quot;Iliad&quot; presented the mythological hero Achilles as what was then the ideal male warrior: handsome, tall, strong, and blond. In Western Europe during the Middle Ages, long and blonde hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. Sif, the wife of Thor in Norse mythology, and Iseult, the Celtic-origin legendary heroine, were both significantly portrayed as blonde. In contemporary Western culture, blonde women are often stereotyped as beautiful, but unintelligent.

==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==
===Origins and meanings===

The word &quot;blond&quot; is first documented in English in 1481 and derives from Old French , , meaning &#x27;a colour midway between golden and light chestnut&#x27;. It gradually eclipsed the native term &quot;fair&quot;, of same meaning, from Old English , causing &quot;fair&quot; later to become a general term for &#x27;light complexioned&#x27;. This earlier use of &quot;fair&quot; survives in the proper name , from Old English meaning &#x27;blond hair&#x27;.

The word &quot;blond&quot;, taken from Old French, may derive from the Medieval Latin , meaning &#x27;yellow&#x27;. The feminine form &quot;blonde&quot; was introduced in the 17th century.

===Usage===

&quot;Blond/blonde&quot;, with its continued gender–varied usage, is one of the few adjectives in written English to retain separate lexical genders. The two forms, however, are pronounced identically. American Heritage&#x27;s &quot;Book of English Usage&quot; propounds that, as &quot;a blonde&quot; (just so, with &quot;blonde&quot; as noun) might not uncommonly be used to describe a woman, but less often &quot;a blond&quot; used to describe a man, the term is an example of a &quot;sexist stereotype [whereby] women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) records that the phrase &quot;big blond beast&quot; was used in the 20th-century to refer specifically &quot;to men&quot; &quot;of the Nordic type&quot; (that is to say, blond-haired). The &quot;OED&quot; also records that this term for fair hair as an adjective is especially used with reference to women, in which case it is likely to be spelt &quot;blonde&quot;, citing three Victorian usages of the term. The masculine version is used in the plural, in &quot;blonds of the European race&quot;, in a citation from 1833 &quot;Penny cyclopedia&quot;, which distinguishes genuine blondness as a Caucasian feature distinct from albinism.

By the early 1990s, &quot;blonde moment&quot; or being a &quot;dumb blonde&quot; had come into common parlance to mean &quot;an instance of a person, esp. a woman... being foolish or scatter-brained.&quot; Another hair color word of French origin, &quot;brunette&quot; (from the same Germanic root that gave &quot;brown&quot;), functions in the same way in orthodox English. The &quot;OED&quot; gives &quot;brunet&quot; as meaning &#x27;dark-complexioned&#x27; or a &#x27;dark-complexioned person&#x27;, citing a comparative usage of &quot;brunet&quot; and &quot;blond&quot; to Thomas Henry Huxley in saying, &quot;The present contrast of blonds and brunets existed among them.&quot; &quot;Brunette&quot; can be used, however, like &quot;blonde&quot;, to describe a mixed-gender populace. The &quot;OED&quot; quotes Grant Allen, &quot;The nation which resulted... being sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette.&quot;

&quot;Blond&quot; and &quot;blonde&quot; are also occasionally used to refer to objects that have a color reminiscent of fair hair. For example, the &quot;OED&quot; records its use in 19th-century poetic diction to describe flowers, &quot;a variety of clay ironstone of the coal measures&quot;, &quot;the colour of raw silk&quot;, a breed of ray, lager beer, and pale wood.

== Varieties ==
Various subcategories of blond hair have been defined to describe the different shades and sources of the hair color more accurately. Common examples include the following:
* ash-blond: ashen or grayish blond.
* blond/flaxen: when distinguished from other varieties, &quot;blond&quot; by itself refers to a light but not whitish blond, with no traces of red, gold, or brown; this color is often described as &quot;flaxen&quot;.
* dirty blond or dishwater blond: dark blond with flecks of golden blond and brown.
* golden blond: a darker to rich yellow blond.
* honey blond: dark iridescent blond.
* platinum blond or towheaded: whitish-blond.
* sandy blond: grayish-hazel or cream-colored blond.
* or Venetian blond: reddish blond
Artificially blond hair may be called bleached blond, bottle blond, or peroxide blond.

== Genetics of blond hair==

A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the adaptation of light hair is related to the adaptation of light skin, and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe&#x27;s seasonally reduced solar radiation.

Ancient DNA analysis (ADNA) has revealed that the oldest fossil known to carry the mutated allele rs12821256 of the KITLG gene, which is responsible for blond hair in modern Europeans, is a 17,000 year old Ancient North Eurasian specimen from Afontova Gora in Southern Siberia.

The precise genetic origin and spread of blond hair into its present-day distribution is a topic of debate amongst population geneticists. 

Geneticist David Reich said that the hundreds of millions of copies of this SNP, the classic European blond hair mutation, entered continental Europe by way of a massive population migration from the Eurasian steppe, by a people who had substantial Ancient North Eurasian ancestry. Ancient North Eurasian admixture is present in mesolithic fossils from Northern Europe, and is linked to the prediction of blond hair in stone-age Scandinavians by ancient DNA analysis. Gavin Evans analyzed several years of research on the origin of European blond hair, and concluded that the widespread presence of blond hair in Europe is largely due to the territorial expansions of the &quot;all-conquering&quot; Western Steppe Herders; who carried the genes for blond hair. A review article published in 2020 analyzes fossil data from a wide variety of published sources. The authors affirm the previous statements, noting that Ancient North Eurasian-derived populations carried the derived blond hair allele to Europe, and that the &quot;massive spread&quot; of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists likely caused the &quot;rapid selective sweep in European populations toward light skin and hair.&quot;

In contrast, geneticist Iosif Lazaridis questioned whether or not blond hair could have originated from the migration of Steppe peoples. He found evidence for blond individuals in ancient Southern Europe and the Levant, with no Steppe ancestry. He also observed that blond hair was rare in the available samples for early Bronze Age Steppe groups, yet common in the later Bronze Age groups, which is inconsistent with the theory that Steppe populations spread the phenotype for blond hair. However, this is consistent with a phenotype turnover occurring within the Steppe pastoralists, leading to a shift towards blond hair becoming a common hair color in the later Steppe-derived populations of Europe and Central Asia. Lazaridis further wrote that the frequencies of traits like blonde hair could have been shaped by mass migration or selection; but that it is more complex than &quot;simple stories&quot; of sexual selection, or of spreading by Steppe pastoralists.

A 2024 study found that both Neolithic farmer and Steppe-associated ancestries were more significantly associated with blond hair, while European hunter gatherers tended to have dark or even black hair.

There is some evidence that natural blond hair is associated with high levels of prenatal testosterone.

==Prevalence==
===General===

According to the sociologist Christie Davies, only around five percent of adults in Europe and North America are naturally blond. A study conducted in 2003 concluded that only four percent of American adults are naturally blond. A significant number of Caucasian women who have blonde hair have dyed it that way.

===Europe===
The pigmentation of both hair and eyes is lightest around the Baltic Sea, and darkness increases regularly and almost concentrically around this region.

In France, according to a source published 1939, blondism is more common in Normandy, and less common in the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean seacoast; 26% of the French population have blond or light brown hair. A 2007 study of French females showed that by then roughly 20% were blonde, although half of these blondes were fully fake. Roughly ten percent of French females are natural blondes, of which 60% bleach their hair to a lighter tone of blond.

In Portugal, the national average of the population shows 11% of varying traces of blondism, peaking at 15% blond people in Póvoa de Varzim in northern Portugal.

In Italy, a study of Italian men conducted by Ridolfo Livi between 1859 and 1863 on the records of the National Conscription Service showed that 8.2% of Italian men exhibited blond hair; blondism frequency displayed a wide degree of regional variation, ranging from around 12.6% in Veneto to 1.7% among the Sardinians. In a more detailed study from the 20th-century geneticist Renato Biasutti, the regional contrasts of blondism frequency are better shown, with a greater occurrence in the northern regions, where the figure may be over 20%, and a lesser occurrence in Sardinia, where the frequency in many of its districts was 0.5%. With the exception of Benevento and the surrounding area in Campania, where various shades of blond hair were present in 10–15% of the population, Southern Italy as a whole averaged between 2.5% and 7.4%.

===Africa===
A number of blond naturally mummified bodies of common people (i.e. not proper mummies) dating to Roman times have been found in the Fagg El Gamous cemetery in Egypt. &quot;Of those whose hair was preserved 54% were blondes or redheads, and the percentage grows to 87% when light-brown hair color is added.&quot; Excavations have been ongoing since the 1980s. Burials seem to be clustered by hair-colour.

===Oceania===

Blonde hair is also found in some other parts of the South Pacific, such as the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Fiji, again with higher incidences in children. Blond hair in Melanesians is caused by an amino acid change in the gene TYRP1. This mutation is at a frequency of 26% in the Solomon Islands and is absent outside of Oceania.

===Asia===

The higher frequencies of light hair in Asia are prevalent among the Pamiris, Kalash, Nuristani and Uyghur ethnic groups.

According to geneticist David Reich, blond hair has ancient roots in Asia. The derived allele responsible for blond hair in Europeans likely evolved first among the Ancient North Eurasians. The earliest known individual with this allele is a Siberian fossil from Afontova Gora, in south-central Siberia. Reich has written that the derived SNP for blond hair entered continental Europe by way of a massive population migration from the Eurasian steppe, by a people who had substantial Ancient North Eurasian ancestry. Blond hair has been discovered in human burial sites in north-western China and Mongolia dating to the Iron Age.

The Hmong people, originally from northern China, were historically recorded as having blonde hair and blue eyes by the Chinese in ancient times, but their features became darker as they migrated out of China and in to Southeast Asia. The ethnic Miao people of Guizhou province from China, a subgroup of Hmong people, have been described as having blue eyes and blonde hair. F.M Savina of the Paris Foreign missionary society wrote that the Miao are &quot;pale yellow in complexion, almost white, their hair is often light or dark brown, sometimes even red or corn-silk blond, and a few even have pale blue eyes.&quot;

Chinese historical documents describe blond haired, blue-eyed warriors among the Xiongnu, a nomadic equestrian culture from Mongolia, who practiced Tengriism. The Shiwei people were a Mongolic-speaking ethnic group who were blond-haired and blue eyed. Blond hair can still be seen among people from the region they inhabited, even today. Some Xianbei were described with blond hair and blue eyes according to Chinese historical chronicles. The Uriankhai tribe of Mongols, to which the military generals Subotai and Jelme belonged, were described by Mongol chronicles as blond haired in the 2nd millennium CE. The Tuvans are a Turkic ethnic group with an occasional occurrence of blond hair with freckles, blue-green eyes.

==Historical cultural perceptions==
===Ancient Greece===
Most people in ancient Greece had dark hair and, as a result of this, the Greeks found blond hair immensely fascinating. In the Homeric epics, Menelaus the king of the Spartans is, together with some other Achaean leaders, portrayed as blond. Other blond characters in the Homeric poems are Peleus, Achilles, Meleager, Agamede, and Rhadamanthys. Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was often described as golden-haired and portrayed with this color hair in art. Aphrodite&#x27;s master epithet in the Homeric epics is (), which means &quot;golden&quot;. The traces of hair color on Greek &quot;korai&quot; probably reflect the colors the artists saw in natural hair; these colors include a broad diversity of shades of blond, red and brown. The minority of statues with blond hair range from strawberry blond up to platinum blond.

Sappho of Lesbos ( 630–570 BC) wrote that purple-colored wraps as headdress were good enough, except if the hair was blond: &quot;...for the girl who has hair that is yellower than a torch [it is better to decorate it] with wreaths of flowers in bloom.&quot; Sappho also praises Aphrodite for her golden hair, stating that since gold metal is free from rust, the goddess&#x27; golden hair represents her freedom from ritual pollution. Sappho&#x27;s contemporary Alcman of Sparta praised golden hair as one of the most desirable qualities of a beautiful woman, describing in various poems &quot;the girl with the yellow hair&quot; and a girl &quot;with the hair like purest gold&quot;.

In the fifth century BC, the sculptor Pheidias may have depicted the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena&#x27;s hair using gold in his famous statue of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot;, which was displayed inside the Parthenon. The Greeks thought of the Thracians who lived to the north as having reddish-blond hair. Because many Greek slaves were captured from Thrace, slaves were stereotyped as blond or red-headed. &quot;Xanthias&quot; (Ξανθίας), meaning &quot;reddish blond&quot;, was a common name for slaves in ancient Greece and a slave by this name appears in many of the comedies of Aristophanes. Historian and Egyptologist Joann Fletcher asserts that the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great and members of the Macedonian Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Hellenistic Egypt had blond hair, such as Arsinoe II and Berenice II. Additionally, the ancient Greek lyric poet Bacchylides wrote of &quot;the blonde daughters of the Lacedaemonians&quot; (Spartans), while also noting the golden hair of athletes at the Nemean Games.

The most famous statue of Aphrodite, the &quot;Aphrodite of Knidos&quot;, sculpted in the fourth century BC by Praxiteles, represented the goddess&#x27; hair using gold leaf and contributed to the popularity of the image of Aphrodite as a blonde goddess. Greek prostitutes frequently dyed their hair blond using saffron dyes or colored powders. Blond dye was highly expensive, took great effort to apply, and smelled repugnant, but none of these factors inhibited Greek prostitutes from dying their hair. As a result of this and the natural rarity of blond hair in the Mediterranean region, by the fourth century BC, blond hair was inextricably associated with prostitutes. The comic playwright Menander ( 342/41– 290 BC) protests that &quot;no chaste woman ought to make her hair yellow&quot;. At another point, he deplores blond hair dye as dangerous: &quot;What can we women do wise or brilliant, who sit with hair dyed yellow, outraging the character of gentlewomen, causing the overthrow of houses, the ruin of nuptials, and accusations on the part of children?&quot;

===Roman Empire===
During the early years of the Roman Empire, blond hair was associated with prostitutes. The preference changed to bleaching the hair blond when Greek culture, which practiced bleaching, reached Rome, and was reinforced when the legions that conquered Gaul returned with blond slaves. Sherrow also states that Roman women tried to lighten their hair, but the substances often caused hair loss, so they resorted to wigs made from the captives&#x27; hair. According to Francis Owen, Roman literary records describe a large number of well-known Roman historical personalities as blond.

Juvenal wrote in a satirical poem that Messalina, Roman empress of noble birth, would hide her black hair with a blond wig for her nightly visits to the brothel: &quot;sed nigrum flavo crinem abscondente galero intravit calidum veteri centone lupanar&quot;. In his Commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil, Maurus Servius Honoratus noted that the respectable matron was only black haired, never blonde. In the same passage, he mentioned that Cato the Elder wrote that some matrons would sprinkle golden dust on their hair to make it reddish-color. Emperor Lucius Verus (r. 161–169 AD) was said to sprinkle gold-dust on his already light hair to make it blonder and brighter.

From an ethnic point of view, Roman authors associated blond and red hair with the Gauls and the Germans: e.g., Virgil describes the hair of the Gauls as &quot;golden&quot; (&quot;aurea caesaries&quot;), Tacitus wrote that &quot;the Germans have fierce blue eyes, red-blond hair (&quot;rutilae comae&quot;), huge (tall) frames&quot;; in accordance with Ammianus, almost all the Gauls were &quot;of tall stature, fair and ruddy&quot;. Celtic and Germanic peoples of the provinces, among the free subjects called &quot;peregrini&quot;, served in Rome&#x27;s armies as , such as the cavalry contingents in the army of Julius Caesar. Some became Roman citizens as far back as the 1st century BC, following a policy of Romanization of Gaul and Lesser Germania. Sometimes entire Celtic and Germanic tribes were granted citizenship, such as when emperor Otho granted citizenship to all of the Lingones in 69 AD.

By the 1st century BC, the Roman Republic had expanded its control into parts of western Germany, and by 85 AD the provinces of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior were formally established there. Yet as late as the 4th century AD, Ausonius, a poet and tutor from Burdigala, wrote a poem about an Alemanni slave girl named Bissula, whom he had recently freed after she&#x27;d been taken as a prisoner of war in the campaigns of Valentinian I, noting that her adopted Latin language marked her as a woman of Latium yet her blond-haired, blue-eyed appearance ultimately signified her true origins from the Rhine. Further south, the Iberian Peninsula was originally inhabited by Celtiberians outside of Roman control. The gradual Roman conquest of Iberia was completed by the early 1st century AD. The Romans established provinces such as Hispania Terraconensis that were inhabited largely by Gallaeci, whose red- and blond-haired descendants (which also include those of Visigothic origins) have continued to inhabit northern areas of Spain such as Galicia and Portugal into the modern era.

The Goths, a Germanic tribe who played a central role in the Fall of the Western Roman Empire through their conquest, were always described in ancient sources as tall and athletic, with light skin, yellow (blond) hair and blue eyes, The contemporary Greek scholar and historian Procopius noted of the Goths: &quot;they all have white bodies and fair hair, and are tall and handsome to look upon.&quot;

===Medieval Europe===
Medieval Scandinavian art and literature often places emphasis on the length and color of a woman&#x27;s hair, considering long, blond hair to be the ideal, as it was associated with gold. In Norse mythology, the goddess Sif has famously blond hair. In the Old Norse &quot;Gunnlaug Saga&quot;, Helga the Beautiful, described as &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world&quot;, is said to have had blond hair so long that it can &quot;envelope her entirely&quot;. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Rígsþula&quot;, the blond man Jarl is considered to be the ancestor of the dominant warrior class.

The Scandinavians were not the only ones to place strong emphasis on the beauty of blond hair; the French writer Christine de Pisan writes in her book &quot;The Treasure of the City of Ladies&quot; (1404) that &quot;there is nothing in the world lovelier on a woman&#x27;s head than beautiful blond hair&quot;. In medieval artwork, female saints are often shown with long, shimmering blond hair, which emphasizes their holiness and virginity. At the same time, however, Eve is sometimes shown with long, blond hair, which frames her nude body and draws attention to her sexual attractiveness. Iseult was so closely associated with blondness that, in the poems of Chrétien de Troyes, she is called &quot;Iseult le Blonde&quot;. In Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, the knight describes the Princess Emily as blond in his tale. 

In the older versions of the story of &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot;, Tristan falls in love with Iseult after seeing only a single lock of her long, blond hair. In fact, Iseult was so closely associated with blondness that, in the poems of Chrétien de Troyes, she is called &quot;Iseult le Blonde&quot;. In Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (written from 1387 until 1400), the knight describes the beautiful Princess Emily in his tale, stating, &quot;yclothed was she fressh, for to devyse:/Hir yellow heer was broided in a tresse/Behinde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse&quot; (lines 1048–1050).

Because of blond hair&#x27;s relative commonness in northern Europe, folk tales from these regions tend to feature large numbers of blond protagonists, although these stories may not have been seen by their original tellers as idealizing blond hair. Furthermore, it is noted that there is also a black-haired ideal of female beauty in northern Europe, as shown in plays like Snow White and other forms of entertainment portraying black-haired heroines. Similarly, Nordic Skalds often glorified dark-haired women.

During the medieval period, Spanish ladies preferred to dye their hair black, yet by the time of the Renaissance in the 16th century the fashion (imported from Italy) was to dye their hair blond or red.

===Early twentieth-century===
In &#x27;Mark Twain and the American West&#x27;, American novel writer Willa Cather&#x27;s depiction of Alexander the Great in &#x27;Alexander&#x27;s Bridge&#x27; was described as &quot;embodying the ideal&quot;, a &quot;large, strong man with broad shoulders and rugged, blond good looks&quot;.

In Nazi Germany, blond, stern-jawed men were seen as the masculine ideal as depicted in the films of Leni Riefenstahl and other propaganda. Writer R. Horrocks noted that totalitarianism reached a ludicrous extreme in Nazi society, where &quot;men were virile blond warriors, women were breeders, and gay men were killed in the death camps&quot;.

The fact that many Nazi leaders, including Adolf Hitler, did not possess these traits was noted with irony by the Allies of World War II. The most famous joke on the subject asked: &quot;What is the ideal German? Blond like Hitler, slim like Göring, masculine like Goebbels. . . .&quot;

Senior curator at the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology Jon Røyne Kyllingstad has written that in the early twentieth-century racialist and supremacist thinkers promulgated the theory that human features such as blond hair and blue eyes were hallmarks of a &quot;master race&quot;. In the 1920s, the eugenicist Eugen Fischer invented a hair palette called the Fischer scale that he said could categorize racial typology—these typologies were abandoned after World War II. Kyllingstad sees classification of race based on physical characteristics such as hair color as a &quot;flawed, pseudo-scientific relic of the past&quot;.

==Modern cultural stereotypes==

===Sexuality===


In contemporary Western popular culture, blonde women are sometimes stereotyped as being attractive. For example, Anita Loos popularized this idea in her 1925 novel &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. However, studies which sought to verify this found no evidence for a general preference of blonde women among Western men. A 2008 study found that men in Greater London, England preferred dark haired women rather than women with blond hair. A 2018 study based on University of Florida students found that men prefer brunette women over blonde women. Swami, et al. (2008) suggested that men may prefer women with dark hair because they are predominant in the fashion and modelling industries, or because they may be perceived as healthier or more fertile than blonde women.

In Central Asia and East Asia, blonde women are ranked below black-haired women in the hierarchy of female attractiveness. In the Soviet Union, Russian schoolteachers struggled to convince Central Asian students that blue-eyed, blonde heroines in Russian poetry were attractive. The ethnic Kyrgyz students, in particular, regarded blonde women as &quot;hideous&quot;, and insisted that their hair be changed to black. Popular television commercials in Japan have portrayed blonde women as highly jealous of black-haired Japanese women. In 2014, a study found that blond-haired Swedish women were ranked below Chinese women in the female beauty hierarchy. According to the author, the blonde hair of Swedish women reduced their femininity, because it was seen as a Western trait. These women&#x27;s Swedish husbands were highly attracted to local East Asian women, which further reduced the self-esteem of the blonde Swedish women.

Similarly in many eastern cultures (Asia, The Middle East) blond men are often seen as symbolizing western masculinity: excessively manly, flirtatious, and sexually attractive. Depictions of relations between blond European men and dark-haired Arab women have even been used as an allegory for European colonialism, specifically in regards to French Algeria.

===Intelligence===
Originating in Europe, the &quot;blonde stereotype&quot; is also associated with being less serious or less intelligent. Blonde jokes are a class of jokes based on the stereotype of blonde women as unintelligent. In Brazil, this extends to blonde women being looked down upon, as reflected in sexist jokes, as also sexually licentious. It is believed the originator of the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; was an eighteenth-century blonde French prostitute named Rosalie Duthé whose reputation of being beautiful but dumb inspired a play about her called &quot;Les Curiosités de la Foire&quot; (Paris 1775). Blonde actresses have contributed to this perception; some of them include Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, Judy Holliday, Jayne Mansfield and Goldie Hawn during her time at &quot;Laugh-In&quot;.

The British filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock preferred to cast blonde women for major roles in his films as he believed that the audience would suspect them the least, comparing them to &quot;virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints&quot;, hence the term &quot;Hitchcock blonde&quot;. This stereotype has become so ingrained it has spawned counter-narratives, such as in the 2001 film &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; in which Elle Woods, played by Reese Witherspoon, succeeds at Harvard despite biases against her beauty and blond hair.

In the 1950s, American actress Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s screen persona centered on her blonde hair and the stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality. She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was &quot;utterly innocent and uncalculated&quot;, parodying herself with double entendres that came to be known as &quot;Monroeisms&quot;. For example, when she was asked what she had on in a 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, &quot;I had the radio on&quot;. Monroe often wore white to emphasize her blondeness, and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off her figure. Although Monroe&#x27;s typecast screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act, audiences and film critics believed it to be her real personality and did not realize that she was only acting.

The notion that blonds are less intelligent is not grounded in fact. A 2016 study of 10,878 Americans found that both women and men with natural blond hair had IQ scores similar to the average IQ of non-blond white Americans, and that white women with natural blond hair in fact had a slightly higher average IQ score (103.2) than white women with red hair (101.2), or black hair (100.5). Although many consider &quot;blonde jokes&quot; to be harmless, the author of the study stated the stereotype can have serious negative effects on hiring, promotion and other social experiences. Rhiannon Williams of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; writes that &quot;dumb blonde&quot; jokes are &quot;one of the last &#x27;acceptable&#x27; forms of prejudice&quot;.

<text>The double-spurred spurfowl (Pternistis bicalcaratus) is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. Like most spurfowls, it is restricted to Africa. It is a resident breeder in tropical west Africa, but there is a small and declining isolated population in Morocco.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the double-spurred spurfowl in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen that had been collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;La Perdrix du Sénégal&quot; and the Latin &quot;Perdix Senegalensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the double-spurred spurfowl. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Tetrao bicalcaratus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific epithet &quot;bicalcaratus&quot; combines the Latin &quot;bi&quot; meaning &quot;two&quot; and &quot;calcaris&quot; meaning &quot;spur&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Pternistis&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. A phylogenetic study published in 2019 found that the double-spurred spurfowl is sister to Heuglin&#x27;s spurfowl.

Three subspecies are now recognised:
* &quot;P. b. adamauae&quot; — central Nigeria to Cameroon and southwest Chad
* &quot;P. b. ayesha&quot; — west Morocco
* &quot;P. b. bicalcaratus&quot; — Senegambia and south Mauritania to west Nigeria

==Description==
The double-spurred spurfowl is in length. The male is mainly brown, sparingly streaked and spotted darker and cream above, chest and flank feathers are dark brown edged and centrally spotted cream. The face is pale cream finely flecked with dark brown, and the head features a chestnut crown and white supercilium. It has a chestnut neck collar, white cheek patches and brown wings. The male usually has two spurs on each leg, the upper one being blunt. The legs are dull green. The female is similar in appearance, but usually lacks spurs and is slightly smaller and less robustly built. Males weigh around and females around . Young birds are almost indistinguishable from adult females after the post juvenile moult at several weeks old, males take several months to develop any spurs. Breeding is unlikely until the birds are in their second year.

==Distribution and habitat==
This bird is found in open habitats with trees. It nests in a lined ground scrape laying 5 to 7 eggs. The double-spurred spurfowl takes a wide variety of plant and insect food. This is a very unobtrusive species, best seen in spring when the male sings a mechanical &quot;krak-krak-krak&quot; from a mound. It has a pheasant&#x27;s explosive flight, but prefers to creep away unseen.

<text>John White Geary (December 30, 1819February 8, 1873) was an American lawyer, politician, Freemason, and a Union general in the American Civil War. He was the final alcalde and first mayor of San Francisco, a governor of the Kansas Territory, and the 16th governor of Pennsylvania.

==Early years==
Geary was born near Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, in Westmoreland County—in what is today the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. He was the son of Richard Geary, an ironmaster and schoolmaster of Scotch-Irish descent, and Margaret White, a native of Maryland. Starting at the age of 14, he attended nearby Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, studying civil engineering and law, but was forced to leave before graduation due to the death of his father, whose debts he assumed. He worked at a variety of jobs, including as a surveyor and land speculator in Kentucky, earning enough to return to college and graduate in 1841. He worked as a construction engineer for the Allegheny Portage Railroad. In 1843, he married Margaret Ann Logan, with whom he had several sons, but she died in 1853. Geary then married the widowed Mary Church Henderson in 1858 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

Geary was active in the state militia as a teenager. In December 1846, during the Mexican–American War, he was commissioned in the 2nd Pennsylvania Infantry, serving as lieutenant colonel. He led the regiment heroically at Chapultepec, and was wounded five times in the process. Geary was an excellent target for enemy fire: a huge man for that era, he stood six feet six inches tall, 260 pounds (118 kg) and solidly built. Altogether, he was wounded at least ten times in his military career. Geary&#x27;s exploits at Belén Gate earned him the rank of colonel and he returned home a war hero.

==California politics==

Moving west, Geary was appointed postmaster of San Francisco by President James K. Polk on January 22, 1849, and on January 8 1850, he was elected the city&#x27;s alcalde, before California became a state, and then the first mayor of the city. Aged thirty at the time of his appointment, he holds the record as the youngest mayor in San Francisco history. As alcalde, he served as the city&#x27;s judge in addition to the city&#x27;s mayor. In 1849, he was nominated for Governor and Senator, but did not win either office. Geary returned to Pennsylvania in 1852 because of his wife&#x27;s failing health. After her death, President Franklin Pierce wanted to appoint him governor of the Utah Territory, but Geary declined.

==Territorial Governor of Kansas==
Geary accepted Pierce&#x27;s appointment as governor of the Kansas Territory on July 31, 1856. Proslavery forces opposed Geary, favoring instead either acting governor Daniel Woodson or Surveyor General John Calhoun (an Illinois politician). Geary spent a month preparing for his new position and then left for the territory. While traveling up the Missouri River, his boat docked at Glasgow, Missouri, where he happened upon recently fired governor Wilson Shannon. They briefly discussed the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; crisis and Geary had previously met with Missouri governor Sterling Price, who promised Geary that Free-staters would be allowed safe passage through Missouri.

Geary arrived at Fort Leavenworth on September 9 and went to the territorial capital at Lecompton the following day, becoming the youngest territorial governor of Kansas. He believed that his previous administrative experience in government would help bring peace to the territory, but he was unable to stop the violence. He told his first audience, &quot;I desire to know no party, no section, no North, no South, no East, no West; nothing but Kansas and my country.&quot; Geary disbanded the existing Kansas militia, organized a new state militia, and relied heavily on federal troops to help keep order. On October 17, he started a twenty-day tour of the territory and spoke to groups everywhere he stopped to gain their opinions.

Despite his efforts to be a neutral peacemaker, Geary and the proslavery legislature clashed. Geary stopped a large force of Missouri border ruffians who were heading to Lawrence to once again burn the town. Additionally, he vetoed a bill which would provide for an election of delegates to the Lecompton constitutional convention. This bill would have bypassed any referendum on a constitution before being submitted to the U.S. Congress for ratification. The legislature, however, overrode the veto.

Geary also angered Free-staters when he turned away $20,000 from the Vermont legislature that was intended to help the suffering from the harsh winter of 1856–57. Geary wrote in his response, &quot;[there is] doubtless some suffering ... consequent upon the past disturbances and the present extremely cold weather; but probably no more than exists in other territories or in either of the states of the Union.&quot;

Initially, Geary solidly abhorred the proposals he received from Kansas abolitionists. By the time of the 1856 presidential election, however, he had completely reversed his position and had become intimate friends with Charles Robinson and Samuel Pomeroy. Additionally, he totally distrusted the proslavery forces and in letters to President Pierce, he blamed them for the deprivations in the territory. Geary even went so far as to reject his candidacy from the Democratic party of Kansas for the U.S. Senate. Instead, he worked with the Free-staters to create a plan for Kansas to be admitted to the Union under the Topeka constitution as a free state, with himself as governor of a Democratic administration. Support for this plan in Congress was lacking.

Geary soon began to fear for his personal safety after his private secretary, Dr. John Gihon, was assaulted by proslavery ruffians. Geary submitted his resignation to incoming President James Buchanan, expecting that he would be reappointed. Instead, Buchanan fired Geary on March 12, 1857, with an effective date of March 20. In his farewell message to the territory, Geary stated that he had not sought the office and &quot;[that it] was by no means desirable.&quot; He added, &quot;most of the troubles which lately agitated the territory, were occasioned by men who had no especial interest in its welfare... The great body of the actual citizens are conservative, law-abiding and peace-loving men, disposed rather to make sacrifices for conciliation and consequent peace, than to insist for their entire rights should the general body thereby be caused to suffer.&quot;

Armed with two guns, Geary left the territory during the night on March 21 and returned to Washington, D.C. Afterward, he spoke at many public meetings about the dangers in Kansas. Although he did not bring peace to the territory, Geary&#x27;s administration did leave the territory more peaceful than it had been before his arrival. Geary returned to his Pennsylvania farm and remarried.

==Civil War==

At the start of the Civil War, Geary raised the 147th and 28th Pennsylvania Infantry regiments and became colonel of the latter. Commanding the district of the upper Potomac River, he was wounded and captured near Leesburg, Virginia, on March 8, 1862, but was immediately exchanged and returned to duty. On April 25, 1862, he was promoted to Brigadier General, U.S. Volunteers and the command of a brigade in Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks&#x27;s corps, which he led in the Shenandoah Valley against Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. His brigade joined Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia in late June. He led it at the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9, 1862, where he was seriously wounded in the arm and leg. He returned to duty on October 15 as the division commander; the corps was now part of the Army of the Potomac, designated the XII Corps, under the command of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum.

Geary&#x27;s division was heavily engaged at Chancellorsville, where he was knocked unconscious as a cannonball shot past his head on May 3, 1863. (Some accounts state that he was hit in the chest with a cannonball.)

At the Battle of Gettysburg, Slocum&#x27;s corps arrived after the first day&#x27;s (July 1, 1863) fighting subsided and took up a defensive position on Culp&#x27;s Hill, the extreme right of the Union line. On the second day, heavy fighting on the Union left demanded reinforcements and Geary was ordered to leave a single brigade, under Brig. Gen. George S. Greene, on Culp&#x27;s Hill and follow another division, which was just departing. Geary lost track of the division he was supposed to follow south on the Baltimore Pike and inexplicably marched completely off the battlefield, eventually reaching Rock Creek. His two brigades finally returned to Culp&#x27;s Hill by 9:00 pm that night, arriving in the midst of a fierce fire fight between a Confederate division and Greene&#x27;s lone brigade. This embarrassing incident might have damaged his reputation except for two factors: the part of the battle he was supposed to march to join had ended, so he wasn&#x27;t really needed; and, because of a dispute between army commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade and Slocum over the filing of their official reports, little public notice ensued.

The XII Corps was transferred west to join the besieged Union army at Chattanooga. Geary&#x27;s son Edward died in his arms at the Battle of Wauhatchie, enraging him sufficiently to prevail in a battle in which his division was greatly outnumbered. He distinguished himself in command during the Battle of Lookout Mountain, the entire Atlanta Campaign, Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, and the Carolinas Campaign. He oversaw the surrender of Savannah, Georgia, and briefly served as the city&#x27;s military governor, where he was breveted to major general.

==Governor of Pennsylvania and death==

After the war, Geary was elected Governor of Pennsylvania in 1866, serving two terms from 1867 to 1873. He established a reputation as a political independent, attacking the political influence of the railroads and vetoing many special interest bills.

On February 8, 1873, less than three weeks after leaving the governor&#x27;s post, Geary was fatally stricken with a heart attack while preparing breakfast for his infant son in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was 53 years old. He was buried in Harrisburg with state honors in Mount Kalmia Cemetery, now, the Harrisburg Cemetery.

==Freemasonry==
Geary was made a Mason at Sight on January 4, 1847, in Pennsylvania (Philanthropy Lodge #255), just before he left with his troops to fight in the Mexican War. During the Civil War, he was the commanding Union general at the fall of Savannah, Georgia. He placed Federal troops about the quarters of Solomon&#x27;s Lodge No. 1 to save it from looting and damage. Later, while Geary was governor of Pennsylvania, the Lodge sent him a resolution of thanks. He answered by claiming it was the principles and tenets of Freemasonry that helped Reconstruction to be as successful as it finally turned out to be. In this reply, he said: &quot;... I feel again justified in referring to our beloved institution, by saying that to Freemasonry the people of the country are indebted for many mitigations of the suffering caused by the direful passions of war.&quot;

==Legacy==
Geary County, Kansas, was renamed in honor of John W. Geary in 1889 (previously named Davis County for Jefferson Davis, it was renamed at the insistence of its citizens; in 1893, the county electorate rejected an attempt to restore the Davis County name), as is Geary Boulevard in San Francisco, a major artery in that city, Geary Avenue on the field at Gettysburg, Geary Street in New Cumberland, Pennsylvania (where Geary owned a home), Geary Street in Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, and Geary Hall, an undergraduate dorm building in East Halls at Pennsylvania State University. There is a monument to Geary in the town center of Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania. Geary, Kansas (in Doniphan County) was also named in his honor, but the town ceased to exist in 1905. In 1914, a monument to Geary was erected on Culp&#x27;s Hill at Gettysburg, but it was not formally dedicated until August 11, 2007.

<text>Famine relief is an organized effort to reduce starvation in a region in which there is famine. A famine is a phenomenon in which a large proportion of the population of a region or country are so undernourished that death by starvation becomes increasingly common. In spite of the much greater technological and economic resources of the modern world, famine still strikes many parts of the world, mostly in the developing nations.

Today, conflict is the biggest famine driver according to the World Food Programme, while climate change and the fallout of COVID-19 are contributing to sharply increasing hunger numbers. Measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 have hit economies worldwide, pushing millions into unemployment and poverty, and leaving governments and donors with fewer resources to address the food and nutritional needs of those most vulnerable. Modern relief agencies categorize various gradations of famine according to a famine scale.

Many areas that suffered famines in the past have protected themselves through technological and social development. The first area in Europe to eliminate famine was the Netherlands, which saw its last peacetime famines in the early 17th century as it became a major economic power and established a complex political organization. A prominent economist on the subject, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, has noted that no functioning democracy has ever suffered a famine, although he admits that malnutrition can occur in a democracy and he does not consider mid-19th century Ireland to be a functioning democracy.

The bulk of the world&#x27;s food aid is given to people in areas where poverty is endemic; or to people who have suffered due to a natural disaster other than famine (such as the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami), or have lost their crops due to conflicts (such as in the Darfur region of Sudan). Only a small amount of food aid goes to people who are suffering as a direct consequence of famine.

==Methods==
In his book on famine, Fred Cuny stated that &quot;the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;evidence suggests the massive food shipments sent to Somalia in 1992 had little impact on the outcome of the famine... and that by the time it arrived in sufficient, steady quantities in the rural areas, the death rate had peaked and was already declining.&quot; – Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)

There was a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers, instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas in which food is available but unaffordable. In a major endorsement of the approach around 2008, the UN&#x27;s World Food Programme (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it would begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas. Josette Sheeran, the WFP&#x27;s executive director, described the plan as a &quot;revolution&quot; in food aid.

However, for people in a drought living far from markets or limited access to them, delivering sacks of grain and tins of oil may be the most appropriate way to help. Fred Cuny further pointed out, &quot;Studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country – though not always in the immediate food deficit area. Usually, merchants begin hoarding food as a crisis develops – in conflicts, to keep it from being stolen, in famines, to get higher prices. Even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad.&quot; from memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York) – July 1994. The Irish aid agency Concern is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another. Concern donated more than $30,000 for distribution via cellphone to some of Kenya&#x27;s poorest people so that they can buy local food.

In the past four years, Ethiopia has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank&#x27;s prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and, as a result, it had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country&#x27;s main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. In addition, foreign aid organizations like the WFP were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Since then, the percentage of Ethiopians living in poverty dropped to 39 percent in 2006 from 44 percent in 2001, according to the World Bank.

==Temporary therapeutic foods==
Malnutrition is a medical condition, not just a lack of food. The bodies of severely malnourished humans, especially children, are unable to process regular food. Instead of being fed food such as rice or porridge, patients are fed therapeutic food for up to one month, or until their bodies are able to process traditional foods. There are two main types of therapeutic foods in use: Powdered formulas (F-75, F-100, BP-100) to be prepared with clean water and to be used only under supervision; and ready-to-eat peanut paste formulations (Plumpy&#x27;nut, Plumpy&#x27;doz, eeZeePaste RUTF) which can be used at home without supervision.

* F-75 (phase 1 therapeutic milk): a milk based powder to be prepared with clean water, that is given to severely malnourished children when they first arrive for treatment. It is normally given for one to three days, in cases of kwashiorkor it can be given for a maximum of seven days. It is not intended to cause the child to gain weight, but only to condition the body to digest food.
* F-100 (phase 2 therapeutic milk): a milk based powder to be prepared with clean water. It contains more protein and calories than F-75, and is designed for rapid weight gain, and to prepare the body for digestion of normal food. It has been criticized as ineffective compared to ready-to-use therapeutic peanut paste based foods.
* BP-100 (phase 2 therapeutic food): a wheat based powder to be used in a similar manner to F-100.
* Plumpy&#x27;nut, Plumpy&#x27;doz, eeZeePaste RUTF: various ready-to-eat mixtures of peanut paste, milk powder, sugar, fats, minerals and vitamins, to be used as an alternative to F-100. The products come in ready-to-eat packets that require no water or mixing. They put parents or guardians in charge of feeding their own malnourished children in their own communities, rather than forcing them to always bring their malnourished children to hospitals or therapeutic feeding centers for assistance. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted: &quot;Nutritionists for the first time can take treatment beyond crowded emergency feeding centers and hospitals settings, where disease can spread rapidly, and into communities where malnourished children live.&quot;

After the malnourished children recover enough to be able to digest complex foods, products containing higher levels of protein can be used to increase muscle growth. Plant protein foods such as textured vegetable protein have been advocated. Besides containing high amounts of protein, they also have a long shelf life and are inexpensive. Also, similar to tofu, plant protein can be manufactured in a more sustainable way than animal protein. This is an important question in areas such as Darfur, where cattle farming contributes to constant destruction of arable farmland.

==Modern relief==
Today, the Peace Corps, religious groups, and charities feed hungry people all over the world, especially in countries hardest hit by famine. In addition to giving them food, they teach the hungry to grow their own food crops, so that they can feed themselves. In some environments (such as the desert, rocky areas, or cold wastelands) farming is difficult to impossible. Such land is called unarable. This is why famine repeats in those areas. New methods have been invented to grow food crops in these difficult areas. These new methods include: nitrogen fertilizer, hybrid food crops, digging wells, reverse osmosis water processors to turn salty ocean water into fresh water, greenhouses, hydroponics, canal digging, dirt hill walls stacking for protection against wind and dust, mylar insulation, and sustainable agriculture.

<doc id="443522" wikidata="Q7087456" url="?curid=443522" title="Oliver Close">
<text>Oliver Close Estate is a housing estate in Leyton, London Borough of Waltham Forest in East London, England. From 1967 to 1996 the estate contained 500 flats in five high-rise buildings. It is currently owned and administered by the Community-based Housing Association.

==History==
Archaeological investigations beginning in 1996 showed that a palisaded Late Bronze Age settlement had stood on the Oliver Close site in the 9th and 10th centuries. Afterward, however, the site was only in marginal use until the expansion of London reached the Lower Lea Valley in the late 1800s. During World War II, prefabricated Anderson shelters were set up on the Oliver Close site for protection against air raids. After the war, the first public housing development on the site also used prefabricated buildings.

===High-rise development===

The history of the modern housing estate began in 1963 with approval of construction of a high-rise estate in the Municipal Borough of Leyton. With the reorganization of London government, the estate came under the jurisdiction of the London Borough of Waltham Forest in 1965.

The estate was built in two stages. The stage approved in 1963 consisted of three 20-storey buildings, each containing 100 flats. The buildings were named Arthur Punshion Tower, Clifford Hicks Tower, and James Collins Tower.

The second stage, at Oliver Close and Auckland Road, was approved in 1967 and consisted of two 20-storey towers with 200 flats. The buildings were named Terence Messenger Tower and Stanley Horstead Tower.

===Regeneration===
As high-rise estates became associated with overcrowded conditions, poverty, and crime, governments gradually changed their approach to public housing. In 1996 ownership of Oliver Close and other housing estates was assigned to the Waltham Forest Housing Action Trust. By 2002 all five towers at Oliver Close had been demolished, and in April 2002 the Housing Action Trust was disbanded. Oliver Close came under the control of the Community-based Housing Association. As of 2007, 330 new homes had been built.

<doc id="443525" wikidata="Q373157" url="?curid=443525" title="John F. Hartranft">
<text>John Frederick Hartranft (December 16, 1830 – October 17, 1889) was an American politician and military officer who read the death warrant to the individuals who were executed on July 7, 1865, for conspiring to assassinate American President Abraham Lincoln. Previously having achieved the rank of major general of the Union Army during the American Civil War, he had also been awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor for his actions in the First Battle of Bull Run.

Post-war, he served as the 17th governor of Pennsylvania from 1873 to 1879.

==Early life and career==
Hartranft was born in Fagleysville, a village in New Hanover Township, Pennsylvania, near Pottstown, the son of ethnic German Americans Mary Lydia (Bucher) and Samuel Engle Hartranft.

Hartranft had some local schooling in Norristown, where his family moved when he was a boy. He attended Marshall College in Mercersburg, a forerunner of Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster. He moved to New York, where he completed his degree in civil engineering in 1853 from Union College in Schenectady.

He briefly worked for two railroads in eastern Pennsylvania before returning home to Norristown to assist his father in the real estate and stage line businesses. In 1854, the young man was appointed deputy sheriff of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. That year, he married Sallie Douglas Sebring. They had six children, but three died in infancy.

Hartranft was active in the Norristown fire company and the local Freemason lodge. After &quot;reading the law&quot; as an apprentice with an established firm, Hartranft was admitted to the bar in 1860. He entered the Pennsylvania Militia, being promoted to the rank of colonel.

==Civil War==
In April 1861, Hartranft raised a Montgomery County regiment of 90-day volunteers in Norristown, serving as colonel of the 4th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. When their term of enlistment was up, the regiment returned to Pennsylvania, although it was the eve of the First Battle of Bull Run, and firing had already begun. Hartranft was humiliated by his men&#x27;s decision to go home.

He stayed to fight with the Army on July 21, 1861. This act earned him the Medal of Honor on August 21, 1886, for volunteering his services to fellow Pennsylvanian Col. William B. Franklin. His citation reads: &quot;Voluntarily served as an aide and participated in the battle after expiration of his term of service, distinguishing himself in rallying several regiments which had been thrown into confusion.&quot;

Hartranft raised a three-year regiment, the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry, and became its colonel. They first served on the North Carolina coast in the Burnside Expedition. Hartranft led them in battle at Roanoke Island and New Bern. In July 1862, Hartranft&#x27;s men proceeded to Newport News, Virginia, to become part of Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps, with whom they fought in the Second Battle of Bull Run and at South Mountain. They also fought at the Battle of Antietam, where Hartranft led the famous charge across Burnside&#x27;s Bridge, suffering 120 casualties. They later participated in the Battle of Fredericksburg. The 51st Pennsylvania was transferred to the Western Theater, where Hartranft saw action at the battles of Vicksburg, Campbell&#x27;s Station, and Knoxville; in the latter two actions, he served as commander of the 2nd Division of the IX Corps while still a colonel.

He commanded the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, of the IX Corps in the 1864 Overland Campaign, participating in the fighting at the Wilderness and Spotsylvania. He was promoted to brigadier general as of May 12, 1864. He continued in operations against Richmond and Petersburg. His brigade distinguished itself in the Battle of Peebles&#x27; Farm.

When the IX Corps was reorganized, Hartranft was given command of a new 3rd Division, consisting of newly raised Pennsylvania regiments. Hartranft was brevetted major general by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant for defeating Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s last offensive at the Battle of Fort Stedman. He brought his untested division from its reserve position and counterattacked to recover the captured fort.

==Imprisonment, trial and execution of the Lincoln assassination conspirators==

In the aftermath of the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln, Hartranft was appointed both commanding officer of the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C., and as a special provost marshal during the trial of those accused in the Lincoln assassination: George Atzerodt, David Herold, Lewis Paine (also known as Lewis Powell), and Mary Surratt, who would become the first woman to be executed by the U.S. government. The trial lasted from May 9, 1865, until the conviction of the Atzerodt, Herold, Paine, and Surratt in late June. At 1:15 p.m. on July 7, 1865, Hartranft led the four to the gallows in what is now called Fort Lesley McNair. When asked if the convicted had any final statements, the spiritual advisors of Atzerodt and Payne stated that both men wished to thank Hartranft and the officers and soldiers serving under him for the kindness they displayed during their incarceration. Following prayers for each of the prisoners, &quot;Gen. Hartranft read the order of the War Department, embracing the President&#x27;s Executive Order, for the execution&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The prisoners were then simultaneously executed by hanging at 1:25 p.m.

==Post-war life and political career==
Following the war Hartranft switched party allegiances and became a Republican. He was appointed to serve in former general John W. Geary&#x27;s Pennsylvania administration as Auditor General from 1867 to 1873.

Hartranft was elected as governor in 1872. He was a strong advocate of education, municipal reform, regulation of banking, improved industry and commerce, and the reorganization of the National Guard. He supported suffrage for African Americans, fought the corrupt Simon Cameron political machine, and championed the rights of the workingman.
During his administration, the revision of the Commonwealth&#x27;s constitution was completed and ratified as the Constitution of 1873. It prohibited special and local legislation; and increased the terms for state legislators: House terms were increased to two years instead of one, and Senate terms to four years from three.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1876.

He was the 5th commander-in-chief of the Union veterans&#x27; organization, the Grand Army of the Republic, serving from 1875 to 1877. He was also a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

The United States celebrated its centennial as a nation in 1876. Hartranft saw that Pennsylvania led the way in the celebration that was centered in Philadelphia&#x27;s Fairmount Park.

At the Republican National Convention in June 1876, he was a contender for the presidential nomination, but Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio was eventually selected. He had served with Hartranft during the Civil War in the same army corps.

During his second term, economic depression, low wages in industry and unemployment, following the industrial boom of the early 1870s, resulted in national labor unrest and strikes culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. Serious civil disturbances included riots associated with the railroad and general strikes of 1877 in several industrial cities: including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Reading and Scranton. There were other incidents with the Molly Maguires in the anthracite coal regions. Hartranft called out the state militia and then Regular Army troops to maintain order. In Philadelphia, Reading, and Pittsburgh, fires were set and extensive railroad facilities and equipment burned, especially in Pittsburgh. Eleven people died along the Schuylkill River before Federal troops restored the peace. Hartranft later proposed recognition of labor unions and arbitration of claims.

Concerned with the governor&#x27;s precedent in calling out the militia to battle civilians in Pittsburgh, the District Attorney of Allegheny County tried to force Hartranft to appear before a grand jury to explain his rationale. The courts backed Hartranft when he refused to appear. Their ruling became known as the &quot;Hartranft Decision.&quot;

 Hartranft returned to his home in Montgomery County in 1879, where he accepted the position of US Postmaster. He was subsequently appointed as Port Collector for Philadelphia (1881–1885). He was also reappointed to command the Pennsylvania National Guard, which he had helped develop.

On August 26, 1886, Hartranft was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor during the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861.

John Hartranft died in Norristown and was buried in Montgomery Cemetery in West Norriton Township, Pennsylvania, near Norristown. The Pennsylvania National Guard later provided an obelisk for his grave.

He was succeeded as commander of the Pennsylvania National Guard Division by George R. Snowden.

==In memoriam==

An equestrian statue was installed next to the Pennsylvania Capitol Building in Harrisburg honors Hartranft. Camp No. 15 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War is named in his honor. Marble monuments at Petersburg and Vicksburg honor his Civil War service. An elementary school in Norristown is named for the governor as well as another elementary school in Philadelphia.

The Hartranft section of North Philadelphia, and a street in the Packer Park section of South Philadelphia near the sports complex, both in Philadelphia, were also named in his honor. A residence hall at the University Park campus of Pennsylvania State University is named after him. Three avenues in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, are named in his honor: the first is in Norristown and is the avenue leading to the cemetery in which he is buried. The other avenues are located in nearby East Norriton Township and in Fort Washington, Upper Dublin Township. A street in the Brookline section of Pittsburgh is also named after him.

Beginning in 1899, a General Hartranft cigar brand was manufactured by C. E. Blair and Sons in Harrisburg.

<text>John Bradley Gambling (April 9, 1897 – November 21, 1974) was an American radio personality. He was a member of the Gambling family, 3 generations of whom—John B., John A. and John R.—were hosts of WOR Radio&#x27;s (New York City, 710 AM) morning show &quot;Rambling with Gambling&quot; (now known as &quot;The John Gambling Show&quot;) over the course of over 75 years (1925–2000 and 2008–present).

==Early years==
As an adolescent in Cambridge, England, Gambling studied horticulture, planning to make a career in that field. Later, he joined the merchant marine and &quot;became chief operator on the big passenger ships.&quot;

==Radio==
John B. was the host from 1925 to 1959, when he retired in favor of his son, John A. Gambling. With his Musical Clock, his all-in-fun setting-up exercises, cheerio music, wheezy gags, weather information and news scraps, John B. Gambling was a WOR fixture. Once he was a British seaman on a World War I mine sweeper.

John Gambling had a band, and provided live music, including the &quot;March of the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; every morning at 7 am sharp.

Gambling bought a home in Teaneck, New Jersey in 1929.

<doc id="443542" wikidata="Q60284" url="?curid=443542" title="Gottlob Berger">
<text>Gottlob Christian Berger (16 July 1896 – 5 January 1975) was a German senior Nazi official who held the rank of &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS&quot; (lieutenant general) and was the chief of the SS Main Office responsible for &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) recruiting during World War II. At the post-war Nuremberg trials, the Waffen-SSwithin which Berger was a senior officerwas declared to be a criminal organisation due to its major involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Berger was convicted as a war criminal and spent six and a half years in prison.

While serving in the German Army during World War I, he was wounded four times and awarded the Iron Cross First Class. Immediately after the war, he was a leader of the &quot;Einwohnerwehr&quot; militia in his native North Württemberg. He joined the Nazi Party in 1922 but lost interest in right-wing politics during the 1920s, training and working as a physical education teacher. In the late 1920s, he rejoined the Nazi Party and became a member of the paramilitary &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in 1931. He clashed with other leaders of the SA and joined the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; in 1936. Initially responsible for physical education in an SS region, he was soon transferred to the staff of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler as head of the sports office.

In 1938, he was appointed as head of the recruiting office of the SS Main Office (SS-HA) and took over as chief of the SS-HA the following year. To a significant extent, Berger was the father of the Waffen-SS, as he implemented its recruiting structures and policies and later extended Waffen-SS recruiting to peoples who in no way reflected Himmler&#x27;s ideas of &quot;racial purity&quot;. He consistently advocated greater ideological training for the Waffen-SS but did not view SS ideology as a replacement for religion. He also sponsored and protected his friend Oskar Dirlewanger, whom he placed in command of the SS-&quot;Sonderkommando Dirlewanger&quot; who subsequently committed many war crimes. Berger often clashed with senior officers of the Wehrmacht and even with senior Waffen-SS officers over his recruiting methods, but he took advantage of opportunities as they presented themselves to grow the Waffen-SS to 38 divisions by the war&#x27;s end.

Berger undertook several other roles in the latter stages of the war while continuing as chief of the SS-HA. In the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories he proposed the &quot;Heuaktion&quot; operation that kidnapped and enslaved 50,000 Eastern European children. In response to the Slovak National Uprising in August 1944, Berger was appointed Military Commander in Slovakia and was in charge during the initial failure to suppress the revolt. The following month he was appointed one of the two chiefs of staff of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; militia and as chief of the prisoner-of-war camps. In the final months of the war he commanded German forces in the Bavarian Alps, which included remnants of several of the Waffen-SS units he had helped recruit. 
He surrendered to U.S. troops near Berchtesgaden and was promptly arrested. He was tried and convicted in the Ministries Trial of the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunals for war crimes and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. His sentence was soon reduced to 10 years, and he was released after serving six and a half years. After release he advocated for the rehabilitation of the Waffen-SS and worked in several manufacturing businesses. He died in his hometown in 1975. Described as blustery, cynical, and &quot;one of Himmler&#x27;s most competent and trusted war-time lieutenants&quot;, Berger was also an ardent antisemite and a skilled and unscrupulous bureaucratic manipulator. Due to his organisational and recruiting skills, Berger was kept as the chief of the SS-HA throughout the war.

==Early life and involvement with Nazi Party==
Berger was born on 16 July 1896 at Gerstetten in the Kingdom of Württemberg, the son of saw-mill owners Johannes and Christine (), and was one of eight children. He attended &quot;Volksschule&quot; (elementary school) and &quot;Realschule&quot; (junior high school) and then teacher training in Nürtingen. He volunteered for military service at the beginning of World War I, and rose to the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; in the infantry by the time of his discharge in 1919. Wounded four times, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and was considered 70 per cent disabled at the time of his discharge. During the war, all three of his brothers died, two killed in action and the other executed as a spy in the United States. Berger&#x27;s combative temperament and very conservative politics fitted him for a leadership role with the North Württemberg &quot;Einwohnerwehr&quot; militia in 1918–19. He married Maria () in 1921. After joining the Nazi Party in 1922, he was arrested and briefly held in custody after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Munich Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923. He trained and worked as a physical education teacher, despite his injuries, and lost interest in politics for some years, before rejoining the Nazi Party in 1929, and the paramilitary &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in January 1931.

Berger&#x27;s SA career was limited by his soldierly ideas of politics and leadership, but after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, he was found to be very suitable to lead &quot;Schutzhaft&quot; operations, which involved the rounding up of Jews and &quot;political undesirables&quot;. In April 1933, his clashes with younger leaders meant his SA career had met a dead-end. His SA peers criticised Berger&#x27;s ambitious nature, outspokenness and lack of self-reflection. Beginning in July 1934, Berger worked with the SA training chief &quot; SA-Obergruppenführer&quot; Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger. Between 1933 and 1935, he was a school inspector in Esslingen am Neckar near Stuttgart, and in 1935 was a senior official in the Gau Württemberg – Hohenzollern Ministry of Culture. He was recruited into the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler in 1936, on Krüger&#x27;s recommendation. Initially appointed to oversee sports and physical training for &quot;SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest&quot; (SS Regional Headquarters Southwest), he then moved to Himmler&#x27;s personal staff as head of the sports office.

Berger interceded on behalf of his World War I comrade Oskar Dirlewanger, who had been imprisoned for two years in 1935 for offences against a minor. On his release from prison, Berger used his influence to ensure Dirlewanger could join the Condor Legion and fight in the Spanish Civil War.

On 1 July 1938, Himmler appointed Berger as chief of the recruiting department of the &quot;SS-Hauptamt&quot; (SS Main Office, or SS-HA), which he quickly developed into a powerful tool for Himmler&#x27;s ambitions. According to Berger, the German Army was initially dismissive of the idea of SS combat troops. He quoted the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Werner von Fritsch as saying, &quot;If the Reich Transport Minister has his militarily-trained Railway Police, why shouldn&#x27;t Himmler also play at soldiers?&quot;

Berger later claimed that he had come up with the idea of SS combat troops wearing camouflage jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of &quot;Flecktarn&quot; camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger&#x27;s account.

Berger had achieved the rank of &quot;Major der Reserve&quot; in the Wehrmacht by 1938, but his initial rank upon joining the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; was &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot;, based upon his SA service. Berger played a key role in directing the fifth column &quot;Sudetendeutsches Freikorps&quot; during the Sudeten Crisis in Czechoslovakia in 1938, and the organisational skills he displayed there marked him as highly suitable for the SS recruiting role.

==Chief of the &quot;SS-Hauptamt&quot;==

===1939–40===

====Initial expansion of the Waffen-SS====

Prior to the outbreak of World War II, the SS-HA had been responsible for organising an erstwhile &quot;civilian&quot; political organisation, the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot;. After the war began, it was clear that those departments of the SS-HA looking after the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS dispositional troops or SS-VT) had performed poorly. During the invasion of Poland, deficiencies in organisation, equipment and training had become obvious. The SS-HA, and specifically its chief, &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; August Heissmeyer, were held responsible, and Heissmeyer soon made way for Berger. As head of recruiting, Berger had already unified the recruiting system for the three main SS organisations, the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot;, SS-VT and police, and in August 1938 he negotiated a recruiting agreement between Himmler and the &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot; (Reich Youth Leader) Baldur von Schirach which created a strong recruiting pathway for the young men of the Hitler Youth into the SS.

Following the Polish campaign, Hitler approved the expansion of the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned invasion of France and the Low Countries, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler&#x27;s control, the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the &quot;SS-Verfügungs-Division&quot; (later given the name &quot;Reich&quot; and then &quot;Das Reich&quot;) commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Paul Hausser; the &quot;SS-Division-Totenkopf&quot; commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Theodor Eicke; and the &quot;Polizei-Division&quot;, commanded by &quot;SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei&quot; Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch. This rapid transformation was theoretical to a significant extent, as Eicke and the SS-TV continued to resist exchanges of personnel with the SS-VT.

The fact that Berger was able to expand the SS combat troops so quickly was a tribute to his improvisational skills. On 1 December 1939, Himmler promoted Berger to chief of the SS-HA. To a significant extent, Berger was the &quot;father&quot; of the Waffen-SS (or Armed SS), a term he coined in an agreement dated 2 March 1940. He used the new term to smooth over friction between the SS-VT and SS-TV, as they were combined in new formations. Berger&#x27;s new-found authority for SS recruiting matters irritated the chiefs of the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; districts, who had previously been responsible for this function. This came to a head when the chief of &quot;SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest&quot;, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Kurt Kaul refused to recognise Berger&#x27;s delegate in his district, referring to Berger as a &quot;low-ranking empire builder&quot;. Kaul&#x27;s series of letters to Berlin came to nothing, as the power and influence of the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; had waned with the outbreak of war and the conscription of many of its members into the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS and police. Ultimately, when Kaul threatened to arrest Berger&#x27;s delegate in &quot;SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest&quot;, Himmler intervened personally in February 1940, stating that &quot;the most unpleasant consequences&quot; would befall Kaul if he did not throw his support behind Berger and his recruiting organisation. Kaul acquiesced, and Berger&#x27;s supremacy as SS recruiting supremo was firmly established.

====The first &quot;Germanic&quot; recruits====

Despite this success, Berger still had to negotiate with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) on a number of issues around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot;. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did not want to see any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.

By this time, the Waffen-SS numbered just under 125,000, of whom more than 40,000 originated from post-Anschluss Austria and other areas outside the pre-1933 borders of Germany. In April 1940, the Germans had invaded and occupied Denmark and Norway, opening up a source of &quot;Nordic&quot; or &quot;Germanic&quot; recruits, which Berger was quick to exploit. After the invasion of France and the Low Countries, the resulting regiment, &quot;SS-Nordland&quot;, was joined by a Dutch-Belgian-Flemish regiment, &quot;SS-Westland&quot;. At the same time as they were recruiting for these &quot;Germanic&quot; regiments, Berger&#x27;s delegates were also focusing on gaining ethnic German volunteers from outside the Reich, men not subject to the Wehrmacht-controlled draft. In May, more than 1,000 Romanian &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; had been recruited, with the help of Andreas Schmidt, Berger&#x27;s son-in-law and the political leader of the Romanian &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;. Three weeks after the invasion of Belgium, Berger was appointed as the president of the German-sponsored pro-Nazi Belgian political party, DeVlag, in Flanders. Berger also worked to bring the Yugoslav &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; under the influence of the SS, which he was able to achieve six months prior to the invasion of that country by the Axis in April 1941. Berger&#x27;s recruiting work with the Flemish and Croatian communities was facilitated by his chairmanship of both the &quot;Deutsche-Flämischen Studiengruppe&quot; (German-Flemish Studies Group) and the &quot;Deutsche-Kroatischen Gesellschaft&quot; (German-Croatian Society).

====Friction with the Wehrmacht====

By the end of May 1940, Berger had filled the authorised quota of new recruits, but his recruiters kept signing up young men to create a reserve that could replace the many older &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; reservists in the three field divisions. To supplement this pool, Berger also continued recruiting for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create friction between the Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were siphoned off to forces under Himmler&#x27;s control. By a range of methods, Berger diverted manpower from the younger age groups, and also targeted areas outside the Reich that were not subject to Wehrmacht recruiting controls.

Berger&#x27;s evasion of Wehrmacht-imposed recruiting restrictions came to a head in June, when the Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Alfred Jodl initiated an investigation of SS recruiting operations within the Reich. The result was that around 15,000 SS inductions were held up by various Wehrmacht military district headquarters. Berger became aware of Jodl&#x27;s inquiry and advised Himmler that even their inquiries had underestimated his success, giving the example that the Wehrmacht believed he had exceeded the June quota for &quot;SS-Division-Totenkopf&quot; by 900 men, when in fact the true figure was 1,164. He boasted to Himmler that during the whole recruiting campaign, he had signed up 15,000 men for &quot;SS-Division-Totenkopf&quot;, when Hitler had only authorised the recruiting of 4,000 for the division in the same period. To justify his actions, Berger pointed to the fact that, just before the French surrender, Hitler had ordered the release of over-age SS reservists. In the &quot;SS-Division-Totenkopf&quot;, this meant 13,246 of the 20,000-strong formation.

Berger had been remarkably successful, despite the obstacles placed in his path by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 men for the Waffen-SS between mid-January and the end of June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the Waffen-SS was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the Soviet Union.

====Re-organisation====

In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA to focus better on its main role of recruiting for the Waffen-SS, creating separate sections to deal with recruiting inside and outside the Reich. The section targeting recruits from outside of the Reich developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the &quot;SS-Führungshauptamt&quot; (SS Command Main Office, or SS-FHA) &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Hans Jüttner on Hitler&#x27;s expectations of the Waffen-SS for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which included the raising of a fourth division and the expansion of the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the Waffen-SS would fall short of its manpower needs by at least 6,000 per year.

Berger&#x27;s SS-HA had a problematic relationship with the SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the Waffen-SS. The SS-FHA wanted the Waffen-SS to be a small elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even if that meant some Waffen-SS formations would be of lesser quality. Jüttner&#x27;s initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate, with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA had also paid scant attention to retention of ranks for former members of national armed forces, liaison with home territories, and even mail. Berger&#x27;s well-researched report to Himmler on these failures was damning, and the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; soon issued detailed instructions on the handling of these new recruits, from the moment they joined the Waffen-SS. Berger&#x27;s criticisms of Jüttner must be seen in the light of the advantages Berger considered he would achieve if Jüttner&#x27;s position with Himmler was weakened.

One of the obvious sources for Waffen-SS manpower was the nearly 40,000 troops of the SS-TV regiments, which consisted of youths below conscription age for the Wehrmacht, as well as older &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; reservists. These regiments were under Himmler&#x27;s control, and were deployed across German-occupied Europe as political police, but the security functions they carried out were clearly within the capabilities of the Orpo. In late 1940, in order to ensure that Himmler&#x27;s instructions were carried out, Berger established a special camp at Sennheim in occupied Alsace, where non-Reich German recruits could be brought up to physical standards and ideologically indoctrinated prior to Waffen-SS training. This was an attempt to address the concerns of some commanders about the quality of these recruits, and their ability to be integrated into units composed mostly of Reich Germans. Recruits sent to this camp included &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic Germans from outside the Reich), Danes, Norwegians, Dutch and Flemings. Berger also created a network of offices throughout German-occupied Europe to ensure the welfare of the families of such recruits, influence the local communities to support Waffen-SS recruiting, and prepare potential recruits for indoctrination. This network and its activities was strongly resisted by the Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans ( or VoMi) the Nazi Party arm responsible for guiding the ethnic German communities outside the Reich. Himmler, unhappy with the work of VoMi in supporting SS recruiting, did not abolish VoMi, he just authorised Berger to circumvent it.

By the end of 1940, &quot;SS-Nordland&quot; and &quot;SS-Westland&quot; had become the basis for the formation of the fourth division, &quot;SS-Division Wiking&quot;. Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were concentrated in the &quot;Sonderkommando Dirlewanger&quot;, commanded by Berger&#x27;s friend, Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger had returned from Spain and been reinstated as a &quot;SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve&quot; in the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; at Berger&#x27;s instigation. In September 1940, Dirlewanger&#x27;s unit had been deployed to the area of occupied Poland, where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.

===1941===
In March 1941, Berger founded the German Guidance Office which was responsible for the recruitment of &quot;Germanic&quot; men for the Waffen-SS. The German Guidance Office encompassed the camp at Sennheim, as well as the network of recruiting offices already established throughout occupied Europe, and became a separate department of the SS-HA, with separate sections for leadership, recruiting and education, and six regional sub-sections.

After the Balkan Campaign of April 1941, the LSSAH was expanded to divisional strength, and following the commencement of the invasion of the Soviet Union, a sixth Waffen-SS division, &quot;SS-Division Nord&quot; was formed from four of the former &quot;SS-Totenkopf&quot; regiments, all of which had been re-designated &quot;SS Infantry&quot; regiments. These new divisions had an initial strength only two-thirds of that of the original divisions. The &quot;Polizei-Division&quot; was also renamed the &quot;SS-Polizei-Division&quot;. The expectations on Berger&#x27;s recruiting network continued to increase, just as casualties began to mount in earnest.

====The West Europeans====
In early April 1941, Hitler had agreed to the creation of the &quot;SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest&quot; (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on the push for an autonomous Flemish-Dutch region within the Reich. Significant proponents of such a union were Anton Mussert of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and Staf De Clercq of the Flemish National League. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because he was actually working towards Hitler&#x27;s idea of incorporating Flanders and Wallonia into the Reich as two &quot;Gaue&quot;, not a unified autonomous entity.

At the end of April, Himmler ordered Berger to obtain 20,000 new recruits for the Waffen-SS by the end of May. With Hitler&#x27;s authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for a limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler&#x27;s target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the &quot;SS-Division-Wiking&quot;.

====The &quot;national legions&quot;====
In June 1941, just after the commencement of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler decreed that the Waffen-SS could recruit foreigners for service on the Eastern Front. He wanted a legion to be raised from each of the occupied countries of Western Europe, but Himmler was only interested in recruiting &quot;Germanic&quot; people into the Waffen-SS. Himmler decided that there were large numbers of potential pro-German but nationalistic recruits available from the &quot;Germanic&quot; races in occupied countries, and directed Berger to explore this manpower source. As a result of Himmler&#x27;s decision, the Wehrmacht was permitted to recruit Frenchmen, Spaniards and Croats, while Dutch, Flemish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish men were Berger&#x27;s domain. The &quot;national legions&quot; each numbered 1,000, except the Netherlands Legion, which had a maximum strength of 2,000. In November 1941, the Netherlands Legion and Flemish Legion had completed light infantry training and were sent to join the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade on the Leningrad Front. While these troops swore a personal oath to Hitler and were subject to SS rules and regulations, they were not members of the SS, and wore national symbols in place of the sig runes. Berger even went so far as to recommend to Himmler that Flemings no longer be treated as foreigners, but be given full citizenship rights as Germans.

The idea of having &quot;national legions&quot; was poorly managed, with some recruits being tricked into enlisting, and many of the new recruits being badly treated by their German instructors. Once news of this reached their home territories, the limited flow of pro-German volunteers dried up. The SS-FHA failed to carry through the commitments made to the men of the &quot;national legions&quot; when they enlisted, and combined with mistreatment and abuse from their German cadre staff and instructors, this had a negative impact on morale and the willingness of more men to volunteer. This was something from which the &quot;national legions&quot; never fully recovered, despite Himmler&#x27;s intervention at Berger&#x27;s behest. However, due to the expansion of SS recruiting rights in areas outside the Reich and the failure of the Wehrmacht to capitalise on recruiting opportunities afforded them, several of the &quot;national legions&quot; recruited by the Wehrmacht were eventually transferred to the Waffen-SS.

====A &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; division====

Encouraged by the success he had achieved in Romania in 1940 with the help of his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; communities of Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia, which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little could be done to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time Yugoslavia had been overrun by the Axis, and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; into his renamed &quot;SS-Division-Reich&quot;, even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. On his way back to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.

Not content with this fairly minor and surreptitious recruiting effort, Berger proposed to raise a seventh Waffen-SS division from the ethnic Germans of Yugoslavia. By the end of 1941, faced with the Partisan-led uprising in Yugoslavia, Hitler authorised the raising of the &quot;SS-Freiwilligen-Division Prinz Eugen&quot;. It was to be the first of the many &quot;foreign&quot; divisions that would dramatically change the composition of the Waffen-SS during the remainder of the war. The division was formed around an existing SS-controlled &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; (militia) drawn from ethnic Germans in the Banat, but Berger had misread the willingness of the local ethnic German population to volunteer for service outside their homeland. His recruiters initially struggled to attract volunteers, so coercion was applied, and ultimately, the Banat was declared to be under German sovereignty, and Himmler approved conscription on the basis of an archaic law, the &quot;Tiroler Landsturmordnung&quot; (Tyrolean General Levy Act) of 1872.

===1942===
On 29 January 1942, Himmler issued an order which re-titled Dirlewanger&#x27;s unit as &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Dirlewanger&quot;, and formally incorporated it into the Waffen-SS. Later that year, when an SS judge issued an arrest warrant for Dirlewanger in response to his unit&#x27;s anti-partisan operations, the SS-HA chief intervened with Himmler saying, &quot;Better to shoot two Poles too many than one too few. A savage country cannot be governed in a decent manner.&quot;

====Baltic Legions====
Within a few weeks of the invasion of the Soviet Union, Berger&#x27;s teams had begun recruiting Baltic volunteers for SS police units, forming several security battalions of Latvian and Estonian volunteers. The Wehrmacht also recruited eight Estonian battalions. This split approach to recruiting in the Baltic region continued into 1942, with some units being decimated in front line fighting. In May of that year, Berger decided to exploit the nationalists within the Baltic states in order to gain access to recruits for the Waffen-SS. Himmler was lukewarm on his initial proposal, but as casualties started to mount in 1942, he changed his mind, and approved the formation of a Waffen-SS Estonian Legion. Despite initial misgivings, Berger also proposed the formation of a Latvian Legion, which was approved at the end of 1942.

====Further &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; recruiting====

In the meantime, the Waffen-SS had suffered over 43,000 casualties up to February 1942, particularly in the Battle of Moscow, and Berger had to replace them. Berger next turned his attention to the Hungarian &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;. Through an agreement with the Royal Hungarian Army, his recruiters enlisted more than 16,500 ethnic German recruits from Hungary between March and May 1942. While this campaign was ongoing, on 20 April 1942 Berger was promoted to &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot;. At this point, he saw a significant difference between SS ideological leadership and the martial indoctrination conducted by the German Army. In September 1942, the SS-FHA complained bitterly about Berger&#x27;s recruiters, stating that many of the recruits were medically unsuitable, had been coerced or duped into enlisting, or were in fact ethnic Hungarians. Late in 1942, more &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; from the Banat and Romania were combined with the SS Cavalry Brigade to form the &quot;SS-Kavallerie-Division&quot;. On 24 November 1942, the Chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller advised Himmler of a proposal he had received from Berger that a Hungarian SS division could be financed by selling emigration permits to Slovak Jews.

====The &quot;national legions&quot;====
The &quot;national legions&quot; were attached to the Waffen-SS, and fought on the Eastern Front in 1942 and early 1943. Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into &quot;SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland&quot;, authorised by Hitler at the end of 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the &quot;Freikorps Danemark&quot;, Legion &quot;Niederlande&quot; and Legion &quot;Norwegen&quot;, supplemented by transfers from &quot;SS-Division Wiking&quot;, new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion &quot;Flandern&quot; was broken up and used as replacements in a number of Waffen-SS formations. While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism, the historian George C. Stein observes that few of the &quot;national legion&quot; recruits were motivated by &quot;political or ideological idealism&quot;, but were instead motivated by such factors as a desire for adventure, better food, the prestige of the uniform, and personal circumstances. According to Stein, Berger had no illusions about the motives of his West European recruits, but paid mere lip service to the idea that they joined the &quot;anti-communist&quot; cause out of idealism. Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the Waffen-SS. However, by mid-1942 onwards, the Waffen-SS faced increasing difficulties with these &quot;Germanic&quot; recruits, especially due to the policy of integrating them into &quot;pan-Germanic&quot; formations such as &quot;SS-Division Wiking&quot;. For example, Norwegian recruits began requesting their release from duty, and at the beginning of 1943, nearly the entire Finnish battalion of that division asked to be released from their service obligations.

===1943===

In November 1942, orders were issued for the conversion of LSSAH, &quot;Das Reich&quot; and &quot;Totenkopf&quot; into panzergrenadier divisions, and the following month, Hitler ordered the formation of two more panzergrenadier divisions, the first new Waffen-SS divisions to be raised from Reich Germans since 1940. These were named &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot; and &quot;Frundsberg&quot;.

From the time that he had taken over as chief of the SS-HA, Berger had made considerable efforts to increase the amount of ideological training received by Waffen-SS personnel. In February 1943, in the wake of the German losses at Stalingrad, Berger again told Himmler that the SS needed stronger ideological training. As a result, the SS-HA issued a series of pamphlets on racial ideology, including &quot;Der Untermensch&quot; (The Sub-Human), which described certain peoples as spiritually and mentally lower than animals. Himmler and Berger also hosted representatives from the Wehrmacht who were keen to learn from SS expertise in ideological indoctrination. On 13 February, following an approach from &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot; (German Youth Leader) Artur Axmann for a Waffen-SS division to be raised from the Hitler Youth, Berger and Axmann were told the idea had been approved by Hitler and that they could commence planning. Berger implored Himmler to appoint him as the commander of this new division, but the &quot;Reichsfuhrer&quot; demurred, telling Berger not to be impatient. Also in February, Berger complained to Himmler that the dispersal of &quot;Germanic&quot; volunteers throughout the Waffen-SS was having significant negative effects on the recruiting of replacements in the occupied countries. In March 1943, &quot;Wiking&quot; was also upgraded to a panzergrenadier division.

In April, losses at Stalingrad and in Tunisia allowed Berger to recruit from foreign workers in the Reich, over the objections of &quot;Reichsminister&quot; Albert Speer, the Minister for Armaments and War Production. By August, he had recruited 8,105 of these labourers, and 3,154 had already completed selection for the Waffen-SS. In June, Berger was promoted to &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS&quot;, and later the same month the new division, 12th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; was officially activated.

On 5 July 1943, Berger was awarded the German Cross in silver. By the end of 1942, the &quot;Germanic&quot; SS had been integrated into the wider &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot;, and Berger drew up a badge to reward sporting prowess, skills highly prized among SS members. The result was the Germanic Proficiency Runes, which Himmler approved on 1 August 1943, although it is believed fewer than 200 were actually awarded.

In November 1943, when German-installed Latvian authorities threatened to resign over conscription, Berger suggested they be sent to a concentration camp. By the end of 1943, the former &quot;national legions&quot; had been significantly expanded. The Dutch regiment of &quot;SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland&quot; was used to form an independent &quot;SS-Panzergrenadierbrigade Nederland&quot;, and a revamped Flemish contingent was assembled into the &quot;SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Langemarck&quot;. The Wehrmacht also gave up its French volunteer regiment and the Wallonian Legion, which became the &quot;SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade France&quot; and &quot;SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Wallonien&quot;. By the end of the war, all of these formations had been given divisional status in the Waffen-SS, despite the fact that they never grew to more than brigade strength. In relation to these recruits, Berger cynically observed, &quot;For every foreign-born soldier who dies, no German mother weeps&quot;. By August 1943, the crisis in the &quot;Germanic&quot; project was obvious, with Berger observing that &quot;we have come to the end of our tether in the Germanic countries&quot;.

The complaints from the SS-FHA about the quality of &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; recruits had no effect on Berger&#x27;s approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the puppet regimes of the Independent State of Croatia and the Slovak State, to effectively authorise the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the German-occupied territory of Serbia, the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Waffen-SS in the same arbitrary manner Reich Germans were conscripted by the Wehrmacht. By the end of 1943, a quarter of the strength of the Waffen-SS was made up of &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;.

====The Baltic divisions====

Before either Baltic legion could complete training, these developments were overtaken by heavy casualties suffered by the West European legions on the Eastern Front, and like the West European legions, it was decided to combine the Baltic legions into larger formations. This resulted in the &quot;Estnische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade&quot;, consisting of the Estonian Legion and elements of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, and the &quot;Lettische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade&quot;, formed around the Latvian Legion and parts of the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The origins of many of the men of the two SS infantry brigades was Reich German or &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, so these two formations were never purely Baltic. Not long after the two new volunteer brigades had been formed and committed to battle, they were upgraded to divisional status, and a third Baltic division was authorised, using the manpower of the Latvian security battalions. To man and maintain these three new divisions, Himmler ordered the conscription of Estonian and Latvian men, and made all former Estonian Army officers and non-commissioned officers liable for service. By 1944, the Waffen-SS included the three divisions, namely; the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian), the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), and the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian). The two Latvian divisions were later combined into the VI SS Army Corps (Latvian), and all three divisions fought the Soviet Red Army in defence of their homelands during 1944, and were encircled there or destroyed in subsequent fighting elsewhere.

====The Balkan Muslim divisions====

By February 1943, Himmler&#x27;s ideals of Waffen-SS racial purity had been significantly diluted. The first division to be raised by Berger&#x27;s recruiters that was clearly outside the Waffen-SS racial and ethnic strictures used manpower from the Muslim community of Bosnia. The 13th &quot;Waffen&quot; Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Handschar&quot; (1st Croatian) first went into action in February 1944, and was of limited value, especially outside of its area of operations in eastern Bosnia. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by the spring and summer of 1944.

During 1944, two more Muslim divisions were raised, the 21st &quot;Waffen&quot; Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Skanderbeg&quot; (1st Albanian) made up Kosovar Albanians, and the 23rd &quot;Waffen&quot; Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Kama&quot; (2nd Croatian), also made up of Bosnian Muslims. Neither of these divisions were of significant combat value, and all three Muslim divisions were dissolved before the end of 1944.

====A Ukrainian SS division====
At the same time as the Balkan Muslim experiment, divisions were raised from Ukrainian, Russian and Hungarian men, demonstrating that racial exclusivity was no longer an entry requirement for the Waffen-SS. In April 1943, a recruiting campaign began among Ukrainians living in that part of General Government (Polish) territory that had been in Austrian Galicia prior to 1919. These Ukrainian nationalists had been referred to by Himmler as &quot;sub-human&quot; only a matter of months before. The resulting division was the 14th &quot;Waffen&quot; Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician). After a brief period of desperate fighting in mid-1944 during the Soviet Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive, only 3,000 escaped encirclement and destruction from an original strength of 14,000. The division&#x27;s combat performance was poor, and it never saw action again.

===1944===

In early 1944, the SS directed the governments of Hungary and the Slovak State to transfer to the Waffen-SS all the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; serving in their armed forces. This amounted to another 50,000 troops. During 1944, Berger gave a speech in which he advocated a &quot;Germanic Reich&quot; that included all the countries that had Germanic or Nordic populations. He said, &quot;Since the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; was taken over by the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; in 1929, its long-term goal has been the Germanic Reich. This long-term goal inevitably forms part of the SS claim to be a formation of Nordic men. It cannot be stopped by artificially drawn boundaries&quot;. He was also concerned that the SS was losing its previous dominance in ideological matters, as the Wehrmacht had largely adopted the ideological maxims of the SS. This narrowing of the ideological gap between the Waffen-SS and the Army was of considerable concern to SS leaders such as Berger, as it undermined the legitimacy of the SS as the leaders of the Nazi project.
The Galician approach was repeated in mid-1944 in the face of mounting casualties from Soviet offensives. Security units manned by Russians and Ukrainians were combined to form two more divisions, the 29th &quot;Waffen&quot; Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Russian) and 30th &quot;Waffen&quot; Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian). Neither reached more than regimental size. The first division was handed over to the Russian Liberation Army of Andrey Vlasov before it saw combat, and the second saw action on the Western Front in late 1944 before being reconstituted as a &quot;White Ruthenian&quot; brigade in March 1945. It too saw no further action.

In the period from late 1944, more Eastern European formations were hurriedly raised by Berger&#x27;s recruiters or converted from existing smaller units. These included the 25th &quot;Waffen&quot; Grenadier Division of the SS &quot;Hunyadi&quot; (1st Hungarian), 26th &quot;Waffen&quot; Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Hungarian), 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division, and a number of smaller formations of brigade and regimental size. Several Cossack units were also transferred from the Wehrmacht. Even the &quot;Sonderkommando Dirlewanger&quot; was increased in size, taking on Russian prisoners of war to boost its numbers.

==Other wartime activities==

===Eastern Territories===
In July 1942, Berger was appointed as Himmler&#x27;s liaison officer with the Reichsminister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, Alfred Rosenberg. To bolster his position with Himmler, Rosenberg was even willing to appoint Berger as his second state secretary, but Hitler would not allow it. On 10 August 1943, Berger convinced Rosenberg to appoint him as the Chief of Political Operations in the Occupied Eastern Territories. Himmler had long wanted such responsibilities to be placed in SS hands, and this appointment meant that Berger could sabotage any resistance to SS domination of the economy and population of the subjugated east. The appointment took effect on 10 August 1943, and lasted until January 1945. In this role, Berger proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European children between the ages of 10 and 14, under the codename &quot;Heuaktion&quot;. On 14 June 1944, Rosenberg issued orders implementing Berger&#x27;s idea.

===Prisoners of war===
On 20 July 1944, the responsibility for administration of German prisoner of war (POW) camps was transferred to Berger. This followed the failed attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life earlier that month, when the &quot;Führer&quot; turned to his &quot;faithful Heinrich&quot; to head the Replacement Army, and the SS chief quickly delegated the responsibility to Berger. By September, the responsibility had been formally transferred to Himmler, but Berger did not act to integrate his new responsibilities into the SS bureaucracy. Instead, he allowed the camps to continue as they were, with the same staff and procedures.

After the war, Berger claimed that he had been reluctant to take on this new responsibility, and had told Hitler, resulting in a dressing down. He also claimed that Hitler had told him to destroy stored Red Cross supplies, stop Red Cross inspections, and block the arrival of further Red Cross supplies to the camps. Further, he asserted that Hitler had wanted more shootings of POWs and harsher punishments. According to Berger, he had quietly avoided carrying out these orders, and even countered a plan by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to establish POW centres in major cities, using the POWs as human shields against air raids. Authors John Nichol and Tony Rennell observed that none of these claims have ever been independently verified, but some testimony has disputed Berger&#x27;s claims. They concluded that most, if not all, of Berger&#x27;s claims about his actions to assist POWs are &quot;unbelievable&quot;, and noted that he did not raise any of these claims during his trial at Nuremberg after the war, or even in his autobiography. One of the few claims that has been verified to some extent is his work to protect the &quot;Prominente&quot;, a group of high-ranking or otherwise important POWs that had been held at Colditz Castle until 13 April 1945. There were a total of 21 &quot;Prominente&quot;, including Viscount Lascelles and the Master of Elphinstone, both nephews of King George VI, and Giles Romilly, a nephew of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Berger arranged for them to be evacuated from Colditz and transported south and handed over to advancing U.S. Army troops. In doing so, Berger disobeyed a direct order from Hitler for them to be executed. This action later contributed to the shortening of his prison sentence for war crimes.

===Slovak uprising===
On 23 August 1944, an uprising broke out against the German puppet government in the Slovak State. The revolt was centred on Banská Bystrica high in the Low Tatra mountains. The rebellion was led by several former members of the Government, and included elements of the Slovak Army and some British-trained parachutists. The uprising was relying on a rapid advance of the Red Army into the Slovak State. Despite the fact that the Soviet armies were just over away at the time the revolt began, they did not reach the rebels in time. On 31 August, Berger was appointed Military Commander in Slovakia, and held sway for the next three weeks. His tasks were to disarm the Slovak Army, ensure lines of communication to the Eastern Front and restore order. He was also to work with the right-wing Hlinka Guard to establish a new armed force in the puppet state. A new Slovak government was established under the leadership of Štefan Tiso. Berger&#x27;s initial force consisted of several ad hoc &quot;kampfgruppen&quot; (combat groups) totalling 10,000 men, against a rebel army of some 47,000. On 9 September, Himmler advised Berger that he had been awarded the Iron Cross Second Class for his work in Slovakia. By mid-September, the uprising had yet to be quelled, and the only regions that had been pacified were western Slovakia and the Váh valley, although the rebels had been encircled. Due to Berger&#x27;s lack of success, Himmler replaced him with a HSSPF, Hermann Höfle, and Berger relinquished the role of Military Commander in Slovakia on 19 September. Höfle then bloodily suppressed the revolt with the assistance of additional troops that arrived in late October. Berger was then appointed to organise the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; (Home Guard) in Germany.

===&quot;Volkssturm&quot; chief of staff===
As Germany&#x27;s situation deteriorated, Hitler decided to form the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, a Nazi Party local militia to defend communities within the Reich. On 24 September 1944, Hitler appointed his private secretary and head of the Reich Chancellery, &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; Martin Bormann to form the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;. Himmler was given responsibility for the military organisation and equipment of the new militia, which he delegated to Berger, who became one of two chiefs of staff for the organisation. Bormann resisted Berger&#x27;s attempts to take over the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, and it remained largely under Bormann&#x27;s control, with local recruiting conducted by the &quot;Gauleiters&quot;.

===Field command===
In the last few months of the war, the Western Allies became concerned that Hitler would concentrate his remaining forces in a redoubt in the Alps. While this idea was more along the lines of a potential refuge from the Russians rather than a fortress, fears of the existence of an &quot;Alpine Fortress&quot; resulted in the diversion of strong forces towards the southern parts of the Reich to forestall such a plan. In fact, at a surrender ceremony on 5 May, German &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Hermann Foertsch astonished General Jacob L. Devers, commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, when he told him that as many as 350,000 German troops were still cut off in the Alps. Berger commanded a &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; of remnants of the XIII SS Army Corps, including fragments of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Götz von Berlichingen&quot;, 35th SS and Police Grenadier Division, and the 2nd Mountain Division. Berger intended to surrender separately to American forces, and after two days delay, managed to locate a regimental commander of the 101st Airborne Division near Berchtesgaden south of Salzburg. On the following day, Berger was arrested.

==Assessments==
Berger has been described as &quot;blustery&quot;, cynical, and &quot;one of Himmler&#x27;s most competent and ruthless war-time lieutenants&quot;. An ardent anti-Semite, he was also a proponent of the Final Solution. The historian Gerhard Rempel described him as a skilled bureaucratic manipulator, who was &quot;unscrupulous, blunt, and inelegant in manner and expression, yet also full of genial loquacity and racy humour&quot;. Despite his own unassailable position at the head of the SS, Himmler was often distracted by Berger&#x27;s gossip and subterfuge against other leaders within the SS.

Within the SS, Berger was known as one of Himmler&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;, and was nicknamed &quot;der Allmächtige Gottlob&quot; (&quot;the Almighty Gottlob&quot;, a play on &quot;The Almighty God&quot;, as &quot;Gott&quot; is the German word for &quot;God&quot;). He was also referred to by the phrase &quot;Praise God&quot; and another nickname was &quot;The Duke of Swabia&quot;, reflecting his Swabian origins.

Ultimately, Berger was responsible for the large numbers of non-Reich foreign recruits that joined the Waffen-SS between 1940 and 1945. Despite the fact that Berger would have preferred a field command, he was one of Himmler&#x27;s few trusted senior lieutenants, and his recruiting and organisational skills meant he was kept as chief of the SS-HA throughout the war. The only exception was the short period as military commander in the Slovak State in the autumn of 1944 during the uprising. In September 1939, the number of non-Germans in what soon became the Waffen-SS was minimal. By May 1945, the force included 38 divisions, and the majority were non-Germans. None of the 38 divisions were exclusively manned by Reich Germans, and half were mostly made up of personnel from outside the Reich.

The post-war Nuremberg trials made the declaratory judgement that the Waffen-SS was a criminal organisation due to its major involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the killing of prisoners-of-war and atrocities committed in occupied countries. Excluded from this judgement were those who were conscripted into the Waffen-SS and had not personally committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.

==War crimes trial==
After his arrest in May 1945, Berger remained in Allied custody pending a trial before a US military tribunal for various war crimes. He was initially to be a defendant in the proposed &quot;Prisoners of War&quot; Trial, but was eventually included in what became known as the Ministries Trial of the subsequent Nuremberg trials. The final indictment against Berger and his co-defendants was lodged on 18 November 1947; the trial commenced on 6 January 1948, before Judges William C. Christianson (presiding), Maguire and Leon W. Powers, and ended on 13 April 1949.

===Indictment===
Eight counts formed the indictment against Berger:
# Crimes against peace
# Common plan and conspiracy
# War crimes, murder, and ill-treatment of belligerents and POWs, including the murder of French &quot;Général de division&quot; Gustave Mesny, a POW who was killed in reprisal for the death of &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Fritz von Brodowski at the hands of the French resistance in October 1944 while Berger was chief of the POW camps
# This count was stricken during the trial
# War crimes and crimes against humanity, atrocities and offences committed against civilian populations
# Plunder and spoliation
# Slave labour
# Membership in criminal organisations

===Berger&#x27;s evidence===
During his trial, Berger claimed that he had not been aware of the Final Solution until after the war, but the prosecution produced evidence that he had been present at the first of Himmler&#x27;s infamous 1943 Posen speeches in which the &quot;Reichsfuhrer-SS&quot; had explicitly spoken of the extermination of Jews. Berger&#x27;s defence counsel claimed that his client did not believe the word &quot;extermination&quot; had been used by Himmler with regard to Jews during the speech. Berger&#x27;s lawyer went on in an attempt to mitigate Berger&#x27;s actions by claiming that the Cold War bore strong parallels to the Nazi fight against &quot;Jews and Bolsheviks&quot;, and the possibility that the US would also have to fight the Soviet Union in the near future. During the war, Berger wrote in an article, &quot;We the National Socialists believe the Fuhrer when he says that the annihilation of Jewry in Europe stands at the end of the fight instigated by the Jewish World Parasite against us as his strongest enemy.&quot; Berger and others also claimed that the unit commanded by Dirlewanger was not part of the SS, although when the text of Himmler&#x27;s second Posen speech was uncovered in 1953, it &quot;cast dubious light&quot; on Berger&#x27;s claim. He displayed no remorse for his actions.
The majority of the tribunal declared that &quot;it seems impossible to believe Berger&#x27;s testimony that he knew nothing of the plans to destroy the Jews or that he never heard of the &quot;final solution&quot; until after the war.&quot; However, the court accepted his claim that he saved the lives of Allied POWs whose safety was gravely imperiled by Hitler&#x27;s orders that they be shot or held as hostages. The court determined that Berger had disobeyed orders and placed himself in danger in order to intervene on behalf of the POWs in question. In contrast, Berger was found guilty of transporting Hungarian Jews to concentration camps and recruiting concentration camp guards. Berger also stated in his evidence that he considered Himmler &quot;an unassimilated half-breed and unfit for the SS&quot;.

===Judgement===
Berger was acquitted under counts one, and two, and some parts of counts three, and five, and was also acquitted under count six. He was convicted under that part of count three relating to the murder of Mesny, and under those parts of count five relating to his involvement with the SS-&quot;Sonderkommando Dirlewanger&quot;, for being a conscious participant in the concentration camp program, and the conscription of nationals of other countries. He was also convicted under that part of count seven relating to the children and youth slave labour program, including the &quot;Heuaktion&quot;, and was also convicted under count eight. Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that he was of the view that Berger was not responsible for the murder of Mesny.

===Sentence and review===
On the counts under which he was convicted, Berger was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, but received credit for the nearly four years during which he had been in custody awaiting trial. Peter Maguire observes that given the status of the defendants and the body of evidence against them, the sentences given to all those indicted in the Ministries Trial were light.

The sentences were reviewed by an advisory board for Clemency for War Criminals, which was responsible for providing advice to the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany John J. McCloy. On 31 January 1951, McCloy determined to reduce Berger&#x27;s sentence to 10 years imprisonment, stating that he appeared to have been unjustly convicted for the murder of Mesny, and that McCloy had given greater weight to Berger&#x27;s active interventions &quot;to save the lives of Allied officers and men who under Hitler orders were held for liquidation or as hostages&quot;. McCloy did not explain why Berger could not be held responsible for the murder of Mesny, despite the majority finding of the tribunal that Berger bore &quot;command responsibility&quot; for the murder. Berger was released from Landsberg prison in December 1951, having spent a total of six and a half years in custody.

==After release==
After his release from prison in 1951, Berger worked in Stuttgart and Böblingen in his native Baden-Württemberg, and managed a curtain rail factory. He also contributed articles to the monthly right-wing journal &quot;Nation Europa&quot; published in Coburg, and occasionally wrote articles encouraging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to give greater consideration to former members of the Waffen-SS. He and his wife Christine had four children: Krista, Wolf, Helgart and Folkart. He died on 5 January 1975 in Gerstetten.

<doc id="443556" wikidata="Q459057" url="?curid=443556" title="Monster (2003 film)">
<text>Monster is a 2003 American biographical crime drama film written and directed by Patty Jenkins in her feature directorial debut. The film follows serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a street prostitute who murdered seven of her male clients between 1989 and 1990 and was executed in Florida in 2002. It stars Charlize Theron as Wuornos and Christina Ricci as her semi-fictionalized lover, Selby Wall (based on Wuornos&#x27;s real-life girlfriend, Tyria Moore).

&quot;Monster&quot; had its world premiere at the AFI Fest on November 16, 2003. On February 8, 2004, it premiered at the 54th Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Bear, while Theron won the Silver Bear for Best Actress. The film was theatrically released in the United States on December 24, 2003, by Newmarket Films. &quot;Monster&quot; received positive reviews from critics and achieved box office success, grossing $64.2 million on a $1.5 million budget.

The film received numerous awards and nominations, particularly for Theron&#x27;s performance, including the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama, the SAG Award for Outstanding Lead Actress, the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead, and also the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature (Patty Jenkins). Theron&#x27;s acting has received critical acclaim; film critic Roger Ebert called Theron&#x27;s role &quot;one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema&quot;. The film was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of 2003.

==Plot==
In 1989, after moving from Michigan to Daytona Beach, Florida, and on the verge of committing suicide, street prostitute Aileen &quot;Lee&quot; Wuornos meets another woman named Selby Wall in a gay bar. Although she is initially hostile and declares that she is not a lesbian, Aileen talks to Selby while drinking beer. Selby takes to Aileen almost immediately and invites her to spend the night with her. The two women return to the house where Selby is staying after being temporarily exiled by her religious parents following the accusation from another girl that Selby tried to kiss her. They later agree to meet at a roller skating rink, and they kiss for the first time. Aileen and Selby fall in love and agree to meet for another date the following evening.

Aileen begins prostituting the following day to make money to take Selby on the date. Towards the end of the day, she is approached by a client, Vincent Corey, who drives them to a wooded area. Aileen becomes uncomfortable by Vincent&#x27;s bizarre demeanor and avowed hatred for prostitutes. As the two begin arguing, Vincent knocks Aileen unconscious. Meanwhile, Selby waits for Aileen but leaves after she does not show up. Aileen regains consciousness and finds herself tied to the steering wheel, as Vincent brutally rapes and beats her. Aileen manages to free her hands and shoot him to death with a gun from her purse. She disposes of his body and steals his car. Later that night, she visits Selby at the house and asks her to run away with her. Selby agrees after Aileen confesses her love and promises to support her. The two rent a motel and try to start a life together. Aileen decides to find qualified work, but because of her lack of education and work experience, she is rejected by potential employers. Desperate to keep her and Selby financially afloat, Aileen returns to prostitution. She kills her clients and steals their money and cars, each killed in a more brutal way than the last, as she is convinced that they are all rapists and predators. She spares one man out of pity when he admits he has never had sex with a prostitute. While driving one of the stolen cars, Selby crashes into the front yard of a house. The homeowners attempt to call the police, but Aileen manages to drive the car away and dispose of it.

Selby confronts Aileen about the owner of the car, and Aileen confesses to the murders but justifies her actions by claiming she had only been protecting herself. As money runs out, Aileen tries find another client. She is picked up by a man who genuinely offers her shelter and assistance. Despite her hesitancy, Aileen kills him. Selby sees composite sketches of her and Aileen on the news and returns to Ohio on a charter bus. Aileen is approached at the biker bar she frequents by two men, who unbeknownst to her, are undercover police officers. Thomas, whom Aileen always referred to as the only friend she had, infers the men&#x27;s intentions and offers to drive her off. Aileen declines, no longer trusting herself with the well-being of anyone dear to her. The two men eventually lure Aileen out of the bar, and she is arrested by the police. Aileen speaks to Selby one last time while in jail. Selby reveals some incriminating information over the telephone and Aileen realizes that the police are listening in. To protect Selby, Aileen admits that she committed the murders alone. During Aileen&#x27;s trial, Selby testifies against her, with Aileen&#x27;s loving consent. Aileen is convicted of the murders and sentenced to death. On October 9, 2002, Aileen is executed by lethal injection.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 82%, based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Charlize Theron gives a searing, deglamorized performance as real life serial killer Aileen Wuornos in &quot;Monster&quot;, an intense, disquieting portrait of a profoundly damaged soul.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Monster&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics; most gave overwhelmingly high praise to Theron&#x27;s performance as a mentally unstable woman – Wuornos had antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. For the role, Theron gained , shaved her eyebrows, and wore prosthetic teeth. Critics called her performance, and her makeup, a &quot;transformation&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert named &quot;Monster&quot; &quot;the best film of the year&quot;, gave it four stars out of four, and noted that Theron&#x27;s role is &quot;one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema&quot;:

In 2009, Ebert named it the third-best film of the decade. Ricci&#x27;s performance also drew some praise, but was not without criticism. In his review for the film, Ebert praised her performance, stating &quot;Christina Ricci finds the right note for Selby Wall – so correct some critics have mistaken it for bad acting, when in fact it is sublime acting in its portrayal of a bad actor. She plays Selby as clueless, dim, in over her head, picking up cues from moment to moment, cobbling her behavior out of notions borrowed from bad movies, old songs, and barroom romances&quot;.

However, several people who knew Wuornos criticized the movie for portraying her as a victim and her victims as villains.

===In culture===
In 2005, a reference to &quot;Monster&quot; appeared in the series &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. Charlize Theron plays the role of Rita in the series, and in the episode ″The Ocean Walker″, a frame from &quot;Monster&quot; appears on the screen with the clarification that this is a photo of Rita a year ago before the plastic surgery.

In 2014, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Charlize Theron made a self-reference to her role of Aileen Wuornos. In the sketch &quot;Pet Rescue Commercial&quot;, Kate McKinnon asked her to play a cat lady, whose image and behavior are based on Wuornos from &quot;Monster&quot;.

In 2018, comedian Willam released his third album with the song &quot;Aileen&quot; and the music video for the song, which are dedicated to Wuornos and this film.

<text>Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf ( , ; August 28, 1895 – November 25, 1958) was the first superintendent of the New Jersey State Police. He is best known for his involvement in the Lindbergh kidnapping case. He was the father of General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., the commander of all Coalition forces during the Gulf War in 1991.

==Early life==
Schwarzkopf was born in Newark, New Jersey on August 28, 1895. He graduated from Barringer High School. He received an appointment from Walter I. McCoy to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduated in 1917 and served in World War I.

==Career==
===Military service and New Jersey State Police===
After receiving a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Cavalry, Schwarzkopf was sent to Europe as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. He was gassed with mustard gas, making him susceptible to respiratory illnesses for the rest of his life. During the occupation, he served as a provost marshal, partially because of his organizational skills and partially because of his fluency in German, due to his German heritage.

After returning to the United States with the rank of colonel, Schwarzkopf was appointed in 1921 by New Jersey Governor Edward I. Edwards to head the newly formed New Jersey State Police. He personally trained the first 25 state police troopers and organized the state police into two troops: a northern troop, utilizing motorcycles, to patrol the Mafia-controlled narcotics, whiskey, rum-running, and gambling rings in the New York City area; and a southern troop, with troopers on horseback, to crack down on moonshiners. On April 6, 1926, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the New Jersey National Guard, being assigned to the staff of the 44th Division. He also held a commission as a major in the Organized Reserve from January 10, 1924, to May 17, 1926.

===Lindbergh kidnapping===

On the evening of March 1, 1932, Colonel Schwarzkopf, then 37, and the first chief of the New Jersey State Police, was among the officials called to the East Amwell residence of Charles Lindbergh, following the kidnapping of his 20-month-old son, Charlie. He arrived on the scene with his second-in-command, Major Charles Schoeffel, and established a police command post in the three-car garage on the side of Lindbergh&#x27;s house opposite the nursery, but he found it impossible to protect the area from contamination.

Further complicating the investigation was the fact that the controlling Lindbergh used his fame and influence to exert authority over matters, which meant that Schwarzkopf had to essentially work around him, despite ostensibly being in charge of the investigation, a fact for which Schwarzkopf has been criticized by experts such as FBI profiler and author John E. Douglas. Schwarzkopf requested a list of all the employees who worked on Lindbergh&#x27;s house, which was constructed following Charlie&#x27;s birth, as well as those who worked in the house and at Next Day Hill, the palatial Englewood estate of Lindbergh&#x27;s inlaws, Dwight and Elizabeth Morrow, where the Lindberghs stayed during the week prior to the completion of their own home.

Although they stayed in the incomplete home only on weekends, they did not return to Next Day Hill by Tuesday, March 1, because Charlie was ill. Schwarzkopf believed the kidnappers were local and nonprofessional, based on their apparent familiarity with the Lindbergh house, the location of the nursery from which the infant Charlie was abducted, and the relatively modest ransom request of $50,000.

Schwarzkopf suspected gang involvement, as kidnapping was a common criminal enterprise during the Great Depression, and wanted to contact members of the underworld, but during the course of the investigation, John F. Condon, a 72-year-old retired Bronx schoolteacher, became an intermediary between Lindbergh and the kidnappers after he placed an ad in &quot;Home News&quot;, to which the kidnappers responded. Schwarzkopf wanted to place a trace on Condon&#x27;s telephone, but Lindbergh overruled him, and setting up a trap would have been made difficult or impossible by Lindbergh&#x27;s management of the case.

Schwarzkopf reluctantly agreed to keep law enforcement away from the arranged ransom drop. Although the man to whom Condon gave the ransom money in Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bronx on April 2 gave Condon a note describing a boat where Charlie could be found, no such boat was found. When Charlie&#x27;s skeletonized corpse was found by a truck driver on May 12, Schwarzkopf inspected the shallow grave, four miles from the Lindbergh home, whose lights were visible from the site. Following the identification of the corpse as Charlie, and the determination from the level of decomposition that he was killed immediately after abduction, Schwarzkopf informed Charlie&#x27;s nursemaid, Betty Gow, and Elizabeth Morrow, who then informed Charlie&#x27;s mother, Anne Lindbergh. Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s need for control over the case was now over, and by the time the case had been months old, and trails had gone cold, Schwarzkopf was the target of widespread and recurring criticism. Following the suicide of Violet Sharpe, a maid for the Morrows who had been acting suspiciously before the incident and during its investigation, some, such as Violet&#x27;s sister, Emily Sharpe, accused Schwarzkopf and Jersey City Police Department investigator Harry Walsh of harassing her to death with their rough interrogations, but experts such as Douglas have disputed that notion.

To test the theory of how the baby was abducted and then killed early on, Schwarzkopf had duplicates constructed of the makeshift ladder used to climb into Charlie&#x27;s second-story nursery window and the ransom letter, and reenacted the crime himself. The 165-pound Schwarzkopf carried a sandbag weighing the same as Charlie down the ladder, and when he stepped onto the highest rung of the lower portion of the wooden ladder (which, like the real one, consisted of two hinged sections and a third one attached at the crime scene), the side rail split, just like on the real ladder. Schwarzkopf dropped the bag, and it struck the cement windowsill of the library, echoing the massive skull fracture that served as Charlie&#x27;s cause of death. Schwarzkopf had the written communications in evidence sent to graphologists, who concluded that they were all written by one person, most likely German in origin.

In late 1932, Schwarzkopf was contacted by New York psychiatrist Dudley D. Schoenfeld, who concluded from the kidnapper&#x27;s written notes that the perpetrator was a mechanically inclined, 40-year-old German suffering from dementia paralytica, caused by a sense of powerlessness; this is now considered an impressive early example of criminal profiling. Schwarzkopf also had pieces of the ladder analyzed by wood specialist Arthur Koehler, who determined from four extra nail holes that rail sixteen of the ladder, unlike the wood used to make the rest of the ladder, had been previously used for some other purpose. Koehler presumed that the kidnapper ran out of lumber and cannibalized whatever wood was on hand for that rail, explaining the disparity. Koehler concluded on November 19, 1933, that side rails twelve to fifteen came from the National Lumber and Millwork Company in the Bronx. 

Investigation of bills from the ransom money that turned up in circulation led to the September 19, 1934, arrest of Bruno Hauptmann, a 35-year-old German skilled carpenter who once worked at National Lumber and Millwork, which was ten blocks from Hauptmann&#x27;s residence. By matching grain patterns and nail holes, Koehler determined that rail sixteen had been removed from Hauptmann&#x27;s attic, which was missing a floorboard, and featured nail holes in four successive joints, where it would have been hammered down. Hauptmann was tried and convicted for murder and was executed on April 3, 1936.

===Later military service===
In the year of 1936, Schwarzkopf was dismissed from the New Jersey State Police after a personality clash with Governor Harold G. Hoffman. For a short time, he narrated the radio program &quot;Gang Busters&quot; (he can be heard in the March 28, 1941, episode &quot;The Case of the Nickel and Dime Bandits&quot;) before he returned to active duty in the US Army with the onset of World War II.

Schwarzkopf was inducted into federal service with the 44th Division in September 1940, briefly commanding the 57th Infantry Brigade in 1941 before being posted to Iran in 1942 through the efforts of Mohammad Vali Mirza Farman Farmaian and assigned to organize the Iranian national police after the British-Soviet intervention that made Iran an Allied protectorate. His recruits, the Gendarmerie, were active in suppressing the Soviet-inspired attempt to destabilize Iran by backing separatists in Azerbaijan and Mahabad. For his work in Iran, Schwarzkopf was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

After World War II, he was promoted to brigadier general and in the late 1940s was sent to occupied Germany to serve as provost marshal for the entire US sector.

Before retiring from the Army in 1953 with the rank of major general, Schwarzkopf was sent by the Central Intelligence Agency as part of Operation Ajax (correct name TPAjax, TP meaning Soviet-backed Tudeh Party of Iran), to convince the self-exiled Iranian monarch, Mohammad Reza Shah, to return and seize power. Schwarzkopf went so far as to organize the security forces he had trained to support the Shah, and in so doing, he helped to train what later became known as the SAVAK.

Schwarzkopf was appointed by New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner to &quot;examine and investigate the management by Harold G. Hoffman,&quot; a former governor of the state and director of the division of employment security. Both Schwarzkopf and Hoffman were active members of the Adventurers&#x27; Club of New York.

===Death===
Major General Schwarzkopf died in 1958 from complications of lung cancer and is buried at West Point Cemetery, on the grounds of the United States Military Academy.

==Personal life==
Schwarzkopf was married to Ruth Alice (née Bowman) (1900–1976), a registered nurse from West Virginia. Ruth was a housewife who was distantly related to Thomas Jefferson. Together, they had one son, Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., and two daughters, Sally and RuthAnn.

Schwarzkopf was a Freemason. He was a member of St. John&#x27;s Lodge #1 of Free and Accepted Masons, Newark, New Jersey, where he was raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason.

<text>Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. ( ; 22 August 1934 – 27 December 2012) was a United States Army general. While serving as the commander of United States Central Command, he led all coalition forces in the Gulf War against Ba&#x27;athist Iraq.

Born in Trenton, New Jersey, Schwarzkopf grew up in the United States and later in Iran. He was accepted by the United States Military Academy and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army in 1956. After a number of initial training programs, Schwarzkopf interrupted a stint as an academy teacher and served in the Vietnam War, first as an adviser to the South Vietnamese Army and then as a battalion commander. Schwarzkopf was highly decorated in Vietnam and was awarded three Silver Stars, two Purple Hearts, and the Legion of Merit. Rising through the ranks after the Vietnam war, he later commanded the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division and was one of the commanders of the invasion of Grenada in 1983.

Assuming command of United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was called on to respond to the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with defending Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf&#x27;s command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm, an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive, which defeated the Iraqi Army and removed Iraqi troops from Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors. He was, like his father, a freemason. He was also a Shriner and was a member of ANSAR Shrine until his death.

Schwarzkopf retired shortly after the end of the war and undertook a number of philanthropic ventures, only occasionally stepping into the political spotlight before his death from complications of pneumonia. A hard-driving military commander, easily angered, Schwarzkopf was considered an exceptional leader by many biographers and was noted for his abilities as a military diplomat and in dealing with the press.

==Early life and education==
Schwarzkopf was born Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. on 22 August 1934, in Trenton, New Jersey, to Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf Sr. and Ruth Alice (née Bowman). His father was a 1917 graduate of the United States Military Academy and veteran of World War I. His mother was a housewife from West Virginia who was distantly related to Thomas Jefferson. The senior Schwarzkopf later became the founding Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, where he worked as a lead investigator on the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. In January 1952, the younger Schwarzkopf&#x27;s birth certificate was amended to make his name &quot;H. Norman Schwarzkopf&quot;, reportedly because his father detested his first name. The younger Schwarzkopf had two elder sisters, Ruth Ann (a civil rights and antiwar activist) and Sally Joan.
Norman Schwarzkopf was described by childhood friends as active and assertive, protective of his sisters and a skilled athlete. He spent his childhood attached to his father, who subsequently became the narrator for the &quot;Gang Busters&quot; radio program. When Norman Schwarzkopf was eight years old, his father returned to the military amid World War II. His continuous absence made home life difficult, particularly for his wife. As a 10-year-old cadet at Bordentown Military Institute, near Trenton, he posed for his official photograph wearing a stern expression because, as he said afterwards, &quot;Some day when I become a general, I want people to know that I&#x27;m serious&quot;.

In 1946, when Norman Schwarzkopf was 12, he moved with his father to Tehran, Iran. In Iran, he learned shooting, horseback riding, and hunting. Schwarzkopf developed a lifelong interest in Middle Eastern culture. The family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947, following a new military assignment for Herbert Schwarzkopf. The senior Schwarzkopf visited Italy, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, and Berlin, Germany during his military duties, and the younger Schwarzkopf accompanied him. By 1951 he had returned to Iran briefly before returning to the United States. Herbert Schwarzkopf died in 1958. From a young age, Norman wanted to be a military officer, following his father&#x27;s example.

He attended the Community High School in Tehran, later the International School of Geneva, and briefly Frankfurt American High School in Frankfurt, Germany (1948–49), and Heidelberg American High School in Heidelberg, Germany (1949–50). He eventually graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy in 1952. He was also a member of Mensa. Schwarzkopf graduated valedictorian out of his class of 150, and his IQ was tested at 168. Schwarzkopf then attended the United States Military Academy where he played football, wrestled, sang and conducted the West Point Chapel choir. His large frame ( in height and in weight) was advantageous in athletics.

In his &quot;plebe&quot; year, he was given the nickname &quot;Schwarzie&quot;, the same as his father, and he was often pushed by older cadets to imitate his father&#x27;s radio show as a traditional act of hazing. Schwarzkopf gained great respect for certain military leaders at West Point, notably Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman and Creighton Abrams, believing them to be excellent commanders who nonetheless did not glorify war. He graduated 43rd of 480 in the class of 1956 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Later, Schwarzkopf earned a Masters of Engineering at the University of Southern California.

==Career==
===Junior officer===
Commissioned into the Army as an Infantry second lieutenant, Schwarzkopf reported to the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he attended the Infantry Officer Basic Course and earned his Parachutist Badge from October 1956 to March 1957. His first assignment was as a platoon leader and later executive officer of E Company, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He later recounted that it was then that he found chronic problems in military leadership, amid what historians have called a larger doctrinal crisis. Schwarzkopf later said there were many officers and NCOs he met on that assignment who &quot;had no sense of duty or honor, and who saw the world through an alcoholic haze&quot;.

He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1958. In July 1959, Schwarzkopf was assigned his first overseas assignment. He was a staff officer alternating with duties as a platoon leader, liaison officer, and reconnaissance platoon leader with the 6th Infantry Regiment in West Germany. In July 1960, Schwarzkopf was assigned as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Charles Johnson who commanded the Berlin Brigade in West Berlin.

Schwarzkopf was promoted to captain in July 1961 and attended the Advanced Infantry School at Fort Benning for eight months and qualified for the Master Parachutist Badge. In June 1962, Schwarzkopf enrolled at the University of Southern California in a Master of Science in Engineering course studying missile mechanics. He graduated in June 1964 with a Master of Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering. He then returned to West Point to serve an obligatory tour as an instructor in the Department of Mechanics. He was assigned to teach at the Military Academy for three years, but after a year he volunteered for service in South Vietnam for faster career advancement with a combat tour. West Point approved his request in early 1965, stipulating that he would return and complete his remaining obligation afterwards.

===Vietnam War===
In the Vietnam War, Schwarzkopf served as a task force adviser to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division. He was promoted to major shortly after arriving in Vietnam. After an initial orientation at Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), headquartered in Saigon, Schwarzkopf was sent north to Pleiku in the central highlands, in the II Corps Tactical Zone. He got his first combat experience on 3 August, when he was the senior adviser to a force of 1,000 South Vietnamese paratroopers sent to relieve a beleaguered South Vietnamese Army force at Đức Cơ Camp. The paratroopers took heavy casualties and a second, larger force was required to relieve them. That force too came into heavy contact. Schwarzkopf and his group fought continuously for several days. At one point, he braved heavy North Vietnamese fire to recover and treat a handful of wounded South Vietnamese soldiers and escort them to safety.

By 17 August, the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived and broke the siege, ending the Battle of Đức Cơ. General William Westmoreland later arrived to review the battle and congratulate Schwarzkopf. For his leadership in the battle, Schwarzkopf was awarded the Silver Star. On 14 February 1966, Schwarzkopf led an ARVN paratrooper assault on a Viet Cong position, during which he was wounded four times by small arms fire. However, he refused medical evacuation or to relinquish command until the objective had been captured and so he was awarded a second Silver Star and a Purple Heart.

After ten months of combat duty, Schwarzkopf was pulled from the front by MACV and reassigned as senior staff adviser for civil affairs to the ARVN Airborne Division. He returned to the United States and finished his teaching assignment at West Point where he was an associate professor in the Department of Mechanics. In 1968 he attended the Army&#x27;s Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, completing the course in June 1969. During this time he met Brenda Holsinger, a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines. They were introduced at a West Point football game in 1967 and married the next year. The couple would later have three children: Cynthia, born in 1970; Jessica, born in 1972; and Christian, born in 1977.

In 1969, Schwarzkopf was promoted to lieutenant colonel and ordered to a second tour in Vietnam, leaving in June. He was assigned as executive officer to the chief of staff at MACV headquarters based at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. Schwarzkopf later recalled this second tour of duty was very different from his first. There were now 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, the strategy of Vietnamization was in full effect, and recent events such as the Tet Offensive and My Lai Massacre had put U.S. combat troops under increased political scrutiny. In December 1969, he got his first field command, taking over the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry, 198th Infantry Brigade at Chu Lai. He later said that the troops were initially demoralized and in poor condition, racked with rampant drug use and disciplinary problems as well as a lack of support from home.

Despite the brigade&#x27;s otherwise-controversial performance record, Schwarzkopf was quickly regarded as one of its best combat commanders. He aggressively stepped up patrols and operations to counter Viet Cong infiltration in the battalion&#x27;s sector. He developed his leadership attitudes during this command. Fellow commander Hal Moore later wrote that during his time in Vietnam, Schwarzkopf acquired his well-known short temper, and argued via radio for passing American helicopters to land and pick up his wounded men. He also showed a preference of leading from the front and prided himself on avoiding the rear areas, which he termed a &quot;cesspool&quot;.

During this second tour, Schwarzkopf noted two incidents that haunted him. On 17 February 1970, two men in C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been called in by Schwarzkopf but had struck a tree near their position on its way to a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim that Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On 28 May 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing that he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man&#x27;s leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf&#x27;s artillery officer.

Returning to the United States in 1970, Schwarzkopf was awarded a third Silver Star and a second Purple Heart for risking his life to protect the soldiers, as well as three Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit for his command performance. Still, his experiences in Vietnam embittered him to foreign policy. Upon returning to the United States, he spoke of a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971. He related those experiences under his real name, which was changed to Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler for the made for TV movie &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; in 1979.

===Rise to General===

Disgruntled by the treatment of Vietnam veterans in the United States after the war, Schwarzkopf considered leaving the military but ultimately decided to stay in the hope of fixing some of the problems encountered by the military during the war. He underwent surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital shortly after his return from Vietnam to repair longstanding back problems exacerbated by parachute jumps.

Between 1970 and 1983, Schwarzkopf took on a number of different assignments. Promoted to colonel, Schwarzkopf volunteered for an assignment in Alaska, and in late 1974 became deputy commander of the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson, Alaska. In 1975, Col Schwarzkopf served as Commander of Troop E, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, at Fort Wainwright, AK. Subsequently, in October 1976, he moved to Fort Lewis, Washington, to command the 1st Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division, where he impressed his division commander, Major General Richard E. Cavazos. The two frequently hunted together and developed a close friendship. Having been very successful in improving the combat readiness of the 1st Brigade, he was nominated to receive his first star as a brigadier general. His promotion ceremony occurred at Fort Lewis shortly after he had relinquished command of the brigade.

In July 1978, Schwarzkopf became deputy director of plans at the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii. He then served a two-year stint as assistant division commander of the 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in Germany. He returned to Washington, DC, for an assignment as director of personnel management for the Army, subordinate to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, General Maxwell R. Thurman. Schwarzkopf was promoted to major general. In June 1983, he became commanding general of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Stewart, Georgia. He immediately established an extremely rigorous training regimen and became well known among the troops of the command for his strict training and aggressive personality.

On 25 October 1983, Schwarzkopf was appointed to the command group for the Invasion of Grenada. He was the chief army adviser to the overall operation commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Metcalf III, Commander, United States Second Fleet/Commander Joint Task Force 120. The operation was plagued by logistical difficulties, exacerbated by poor communication and lack of co-operation between the branches of the United States military. Schwarzkopf was named deputy commander of the invasion at the last minute, leaving him with little say in the planning. Schwarzkopf helped lead the initial landing operations while he was aboard . He was involved in an incident where the colonel commanding the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit initially refused to fly Army troops in Marine helicopters.

He flew into St. George&#x27;s on the second day of the operation. While he initially did not think the US should have been involved in the conflict, he later said he considered the mission a success because it reasserted the dominance of the US military after the Vietnam War. Following the invasion, Schwarzkopf returned to the 24th Infantry Division and completed his tour as its commander. He was then among the leaders who were criticized for the poor interservice co-operation in the operation, particularly the poor communication between forces of the different branches in combat. The operation was a learning experience for Schwarzkopf, who saw the need to develop greater co-operation between the services for future joint operations. He would later push for more policies to make joint warfare, and interservice co-operation standard practice in warfare. Specifically, the operation demonstrated a need for greater joint roles in planning, deploying troops, and communicating operations. Subsequent operations gave more authority to joint commanders in operations and doctrine and emphasized joint warfare doctrine over service-centered doctrine.

In July 1985, Schwarzkopf began an 11-month assignment as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Pentagon. On 1 July 1986, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and was reassigned to Fort Lewis as commander of I Corps. He held the post for 14 months before returning to the Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in August 1987. In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army&#x27;s senior member on the Military Staff Committee at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings with representatives from other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he sat in on arms reduction talks with leaders from the Soviet Union.

====CENTCOM commander====

In November 1988, Schwarzkopf was named commander of United States Central Command (CENTCOM), succeeding General George B. Crist. Schwarzkopf was selected over a more popular choice, Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin because commanders considered him an accomplished strategic thinker who had experience both in combat and with diplomacy and had great knowledge of the Middle East from his childhood experiences there. He assumed command of CENTCOM, with his headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, and was promoted to general. At the time of this appointment, CENTCOM had overall responsibility for U.S. military operations in 19 countries, and had 200,000 service members on call should a crisis arise. Schwarzkopf immediately took to changing the focus of the command, which had focused on the &quot;Zagros Doctrine&quot;, a hypothetical ground invasion by the Soviet Union through the Zagros Mountains, which the US would counter in Iran. Schwarzkopf was more concerned with the effects of the Iran–Iraq War on the stability of the region than of an external threat posed by the Soviet Union.

In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 1989, Schwarzkopf maintained that the Soviet Union was a threat to the region, but when giving an overview of the countries in the region, he noted that Iraq posed a threat to its weaker neighbors. He implored for the US to &quot;seek to assert a moderating influence in Iraq&quot;. With regional turmoil growing, Schwarzkopf became concerned about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, focusing the attention of his command on preparing to respond to what he thought was a &quot;more realistic scenario&quot;. That year, his command began planning to counter an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, seeing it as a likely conflict that would threaten the interests of the United States.

In early 1990, he testified again before the Senate Armed Services Committee in threat-assessment hearings that the Cold War was ending and that it was less likely the Soviet Union would exert military force in the region. Though he declined to identify Iraq specifically as a threat, he noted a regional conflict was the most likely event to destabilize the region and that noted Iraq&#x27;s ceasefire with Iran meant it was continuing to grow and modernize its military. In early 1990, he drafted a war plan, Operations Plan , titled &quot;Defense of the Arabian Peninsula&quot;, which envisioned an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia through Kuwait.

During CENTCOM military exercises in July 1990, termed Internal Look &#x27;90, Schwarzkopf wrote a scenario that tested how the command would respond to a regional dictator invading a neighboring country and threatening oilfields there, which closely mirrored the rising tension between Iraq and Kuwait. One week after the end of the exercises, Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990.

===Gulf War===
Initially believing that the Iraqi Army would advance only to the Rumailah oil field, Schwarzkopf was surprised when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with US President George H. W. Bush, where his &quot;Internal Look &#x27;90&quot; command post wargame was made the basis of a potential counteroffensive plan. By 5 August, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military.

With Fahd&#x27;s consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on 7 August, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was adamant to avoid repeating many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially the slow escalation of air power and troop forces. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By 13 August, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.

====Operation Desert Shield====
From his headquarters in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis as director of the logistical operations, with US Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and US Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By 20 August, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on 25 August, and on 29 August, he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters.

Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh until December and made frequent frontline visits to the troops. On 29 December 1990, he received a warning order from the Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by 17 January.
Initially, Operation Desert Shield involved a sea interdiction campaign that saw international warships detaining and inspecting tankers from Iraq. As the buildup continued, Schwarzkopf was occupied with planning an offensive operation against the Iraqi units along the border, sometimes working 18-hour days in planning, closely assisted by a group of aides. He frequently met with subordinates and Saudi commanders. Schwarzkopf planned counters for Iraq&#x27;s large armored forces, air forces, and elite Republican Guard forces. While planning, Schwarzkopf remained in frequent contact with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell (also a Vietnam veteran) concerning Schwarzkopf&#x27;s plans for the offensive.

Schwarzkopf devised an operational plan, dubbed &quot;Operation Desert Storm&quot;, to be based on overwhelming force and strong infantry attacks supported by artillery and armor. By 8 November, Bush agreed to commit 400,000 US troops to Saudi Arabia at Schwarzkopf&#x27;s insistence. Schwarzkopf believed that more troops would reduce the likelihood of high casualties. He planned a strategic bombing campaign to precede an offensive into Kuwait, simultaneously striking the forward Iraqi forces and their supply lines. In the meantime, diplomatic solutions began to break down, and the deadline established by the United Nations Security Council, 15 January 1991, passed without a solution.

By then, Schwarzkopf commanded an international army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 US troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, as well as thousands of main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the US and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf&#x27;s experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including the allied commanders, with greater ease. He had a good relationship with Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who, in turn, helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the co-operation, he later said that he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war.

Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Calvin Waller, who handled much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also co-operated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders allowed their forces to co-operate effectively during the operation.

====Operation Desert Storm====
The air campaign against Iraq began on 17 January 1991, after 139 days of planning and buildup. Schwarzkopf sent a prepared statement to the troops ahead of the first airstrikes, which were timed to hit their targets at 02:40. He oversaw the strikes from his war room in Riyadh, emerged from his command center late in the day on 18 January to speak to the press, and said the air war had gone &quot;just about exactly as we had intended it to go&quot;. He then began making frequent briefings to the media. He declined to measure the success of the campaign by counting suspected Iraqi casualties, believing that would undermine his credibility.

The air campaign proved to be a success by achieving air superiority and destroying the Iraqi military&#x27;s communications network, supplies, and many tanks and armored vehicles. By 20 January he announced Iraq&#x27;s nuclear test reactors had been destroyed, and by 27 January he announced that the coalition had total air superiority in Iraq. Over 38 days, the Air Force destroyed 39 percent of the T72 tanks, 32 percent of the armored personnel carriers, and 47 percent of the artillery. In the aggregate, the Air Force met the goal of 50 percent attrition of the Iraqi ground force. Bush then gave Hussein an ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait by 12:00 on 23 February or Schwarzkopf&#x27;s ground forces would attack.

Schwarzkopf began his ground campaign in earnest at 04:00 on 24 February, with the Saudi-led Arab forces attacking into Kuwait City, while two US Marine Corps divisions struck at the oil fields, and the VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps on the left flank struck quickly to cut off the Iraqi forces from the west, which would later be known as his &quot;Left Hook&quot; strategy. Schwarzkopf expected the war to last several weeks and had anticipated chemical weapon attacks by the Iraqi forces, which did not occur. Resistance was lighter than Schwarzkopf expected, and Iraqi troops surrendered in large numbers.

Within 90 hours, his force had destroyed 42 of 50 Iraqi Army divisions at a cost of about 125 killed and 200 wounded among American troops, and about 482 killed, 458 wounded among all of the coalition. He ordered his forces to destroy as much Iraqi armor and equipment as possible to ensure the weakening of Iraq&#x27;s offensive capability in the near term. White House chief of staff John Sununu suggested that should the cease-fire take effect at 5 a.m. on 28 February, it would be possible to name the conflict &quot;The Hundred Hour War&quot;. Powell agreed and talked with Schwarzkopf, who pointed out that it would also make it a &quot;Five Day War&quot;.

Schwarzkopf, who had ordered a media blackout during the ground offensive, finally appeared before journalists on 27 February to explain his strategy. On 3 March, he arrived in Kuwait City to survey the aftermath of the Iraqi occupation and negotiate a ceasefire with Iraqi military leaders and to work out the return of prisoners of war on both sides. With this in place, he then began the process of overseeing U.S. troops returning from the conflict.

For his services during the war, Schwarzkopf was welcomed back to America with a large parade down Broadway in New York, along with other honors. He became the only person to receive the Distinguished Service Medal from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, DC, on 8 June 1991, where he was greeted by Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised very differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity and the source of great curiosity by the general public. He was quick to award praise and medals to the troops, part of what he saw as restoring pride in the US armed forces after the Vietnam War.

==Later life==
===Retirement===
Schwarzkopf returned to the United States after the Gulf War as a national hero, and his ability to effectively deal with the press left him a positive image. Schwarzkopf indicated a desire to retire from the military in mid-1991. He was initially considered for promotion alternatively to General of the Army or to Army Chief of Staff, and was ultimately asked to assume the latter post, but he declined. He was later questioned about running for political office, but, considering himself an independent, expressed little interest in doing so; ultimately denying speculation of possibly seeking the Senate seat in Florida. Schwarzkopf was not vocal about his political opinions during his military career. He retired from the military in August 1991, moving to Tampa, Florida.

Following his retirement, Schwarzkopf attained a status as celebrity, and was highly praised in the news media. He was profiled by the Associated Press, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, and &quot;People&quot;, as well as praised in a Random House publication on the war, &quot;Triumph in the Desert&quot;. Schwarzkopf&#x27;s speaking fees topped $60,000 per public appearance.

In 1992, Schwarzkopf published a memoir, &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Take a Hero,&quot; about his life; it became a bestseller. Schwarzkopf sold the rights to his memoirs to Bantam Books for $5,000,000. In 1993, Schwarzkopf was found to have prostate cancer, for which he was successfully treated. Among the many honors he received was the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. Queen Elizabeth II honorarily knighted Schwarzkopf and he was awarded many other military accolades from foreign countries. He led the Pegasus Parade at the Kentucky Derby and was an honorary guest at the Indianapolis 500. He supported several children&#x27;s charities and national philanthropic causes, and he was a spokesperson for prostate cancer awareness, recovery of the grizzly bear from endangered species status, and served on the Nature Conservancy board of governors. Schwarzkopf otherwise sought to live out a low-profile retirement in Tampa, though he briefly served as a military commentator for NBC.

On 7 November 1994, Schwarzkopf won $14,000 for the Boggy Creek Gang on &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;

In 2002, he was involved with an educational video game about asthma, &quot;Quest for the Code&quot;, which he launched with Steven Spielberg through the Starbright Foundation. He also voiced a character in the game.

At first, Schwarzkopf was ambivalent during the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell&#x27;s presentation to the United Nations on 6 February 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did not take into account the cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.
Schwarzkopf endorsed George W. Bush in the 2000 U.S. presidential election and the 2004 U.S. presidential election. He supported John McCain in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. He was on several occasions encouraged to run for United States Senate or President of the United States as a member of the Republican Party, but showed no interest.

===Death===

Schwarzkopf died at age of 78 on 27 December 2012, of complications following a bout of pneumonia. A memorial service was conducted on 28 February 2013, at the Cadet Chapel at West Point, which was attended by Colin Powell, Schwarzkopf&#x27;s family, and others. Schwarzkopf was cremated and his ashes were buried near those of his father in the West Point Cemetery in a ceremony attended by cadets, military leaders, New York and New Jersey State Police Troopers.

Among reactions to Schwarzkopf&#x27;s death, George H. W. Bush said of him: &quot;General Norm Schwarzkopf, to me, epitomized the &#x27;duty, service, country&#x27; creed that has defended our freedom and seen this great Nation through our most trying international crises. More than that, he was a good and decent man and a dear friend&quot;. In a statement, president Barack Obama said &quot;From his decorated service in Vietnam to the historic liberation of Kuwait and his leadership of United States Central Command, General Schwarzkopf stood tall for the country and Army he loved&quot;. In a letter, Secretary of the Army John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno wrote in a joint statement, &quot;Our nation owes a great debt of gratitude to General Schwarzkopf and our Soldiers will hold a special place in their hearts for this great leader. While much will be written in coming days of his many accomplishments, his most lasting and important legacies are the tremendous soldiers he trained and led&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Leadership style===
During his tour of duty in Vietnam, Schwarzkopf developed a reputation as a commander who preferred to lead from the front, even willing to risk his own life for his subordinates. His leadership style stressed preparedness, discipline and rigorous training, but also allowed his troops to enjoy the luxuries they had. In a valedictory address to West Point cadets he stressed the need for competence and character. His rehabilitation of the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry stressed survival as well as offense. Like German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and General George S. Patton, Schwarzkopf highly regarded decisiveness and valued determination among his commanders. He pushed for offensive combat over defensive operations in the Gulf War.

He was known to be extremely critical of staff officers who were unprepared, but was even more contentious with other generals who he felt were not aggressive enough. His frequent short temper with subordinates was well known in his command. His leadership style was sometimes criticized by subordinates who felt it reduced their ability to solve problems creatively. Army Chief of Staff Carl E. Vuono, a lifelong friend of Schwarzkopf, described him as &quot;competent, compassionate, egotistical, loyal, opinionated, funny, emotional, sensitive to any slight. At times he can be an overbearing bastard, but not with me&quot;. While Colin Powell would say Schwarzkopf&#x27;s strengths outweighed his weaknesses, Dick Cheney personally disliked what he considered Schwarzkopf&#x27;s pretentious behavior with subordinates. Cheney doubted Schwarzkopf&#x27;s ability to lead the Gulf War, and so Powell dealt with Schwarzkopf instead.

===Critiques of Gulf War leadership===
The quick and decisive results of the Gulf War were attributed to Schwarzkopf&#x27;s leadership. President Bush declared, &quot;Lesson number one from the Gulf War is the value of air power&quot;. Secretary of Defense Cheney said, &quot;The air campaign was decisive&quot;.

Historian Rick Atkinson considered Schwarzkopf &quot;the most theatrical American in uniform since Douglas MacArthur&quot;. Atkinson further contended that in his leadership during the Gulf War, Schwarzkopf conducted one of the greatest military campaigns of all time, providing the United States with its &quot;first battlefield hero in decades&quot;. The later accomplishments of General Tommy Franks during Operation Enduring Freedom were compared favorably with those of Schwarzkopf. However, in an analysis of the effects of the Gulf War, several historians, including Spencer C. Tucker, contended that Schwarzkopf&#x27;s ceasefire agreement allowed Iraq to continue to fly armed helicopters, which allowed it to later conduct operations against its Shia Arab and Kurdish populations. Schwarzkopf later wrote it would have been a mistake to continue the offensive and capture all of Iraq, noting that the U.S. would likely have had to pay the entire cost of rebuilding the country.

Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor wrote in their 1995 book &quot;The Generals&#x27; War&quot;: &quot;Behind-the-scenes sniping continued, for the confrontation between the Army field commanders and the Air Force was not so much about the performance of airpower as the Army&#x27;s inability to control it.. As the Air Force saw it, the Gulf War was a model for future conflicts. But neither the Army nor the Marines wanted to go to war that way again&quot;.

In a 2012 book, historian Thomas E. Ricks wrote Schwarzkopf&#x27;s lack of experience with politics was disadvantageous to his conduct of the war. Ricks said that Schwarzkopf was overly cautious in the execution of his plans because of his fear of repeating mistakes in Vietnam, which meant his troops failed to destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard. Ricks further criticized Schwarzkopf for failing to relieve General Frederick M. Franks Jr. as well as other subordinates who Schwarzkopf said, in his memoirs, were ineffective. Ricks concluded that the Gulf War was a &quot;tactical triumph but a strategic draw at best&quot;. In his memoirs, Schwarzkopf responded to these kinds of criticisms by saying his mandate had only been to liberate and safeguard Kuwait and that an invasion of Iraq would have been highly controversial, particularly among Middle Eastern military allies.

Schwarzkopf sought to change the relationship between journalists and the military, feeling that the news media&#x27;s negative portrayal of the Vietnam War had degraded troops there. When he took command during the Gulf War, he sought an entirely different strategy, which was ultimately successful by favoring greater media coverage but subject to strict controls on the battlefield. Schwarzkopf favored the intense press surrounding the Gulf War conflict, feeling that blocking the news media, as had been done in Grenada, would affect public perception of the war in the United States negatively. His dealings with the press were thus frequent and very personal, and he conducted regular briefings for journalists. He would usually not attack media coverage, even if negative, unless he felt it was blatantly incorrect. He staged visible media appearances that played to patriotism.

In fact, Schwarzkopf believed extensive press coverage would help build public support for the war and raise morale. In some press conferences, he showed and explained advanced war-fighting technology that the U.S. possessed to impress the public. These also had the side effect of distracting the public from focusing on U.S. casualty counts or the destruction wrought in the war. Schwarzkopf&#x27;s strategy was to control the message being sent and so he ordered media on the battlefield to be escorted at all times. However, several high-profile reports publicized the CENTCOM strategy. After the war, Schwarzkopf was very critical of military analysts who scrutinized his operation, felt that some of them were poorly informed on the factors involved in his planning, and felt that others were violating operations security by revealing too much about how he might plan the operation.

<text>Bronte International University (formerly known as Trinity College and University) is an unaccredited post-secondary educational institution formerly in South Dakota. It is widely considered to be a diploma mill, operated from an unknown location. Its website offers &quot;fast&quot; degrees for &quot;life experience.&quot;

The Trinity College and University that was based in South Dakota and later became Bronte International University is currently based in Tortola, the British Virgin Islands, and is registered as a corporation with the United Kingdom.

==Location==
The &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; described it as &quot;a British institution with no building, campus, faculty, or president, and run from a post office box in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.&quot; According to the Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization, it is &quot;probably&quot; operated in the Caribbean and &quot;also operated in Louisiana and maybe elsewhere.&quot;

==Academics and accreditation status==

The institution claims to be accredited by the Association for Online Academic Excellence (AOAE), but this is not a recognized accreditation association of higher learning. It has been listed as a diploma mill by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.

Course descriptions found on the institution&#x27;s now defunct website were copied verbatim from the course offerings of Thomas Edison State College of Trenton, New Jersey.

==Other institutions with similar names==
Bronte International University was originally known as &quot;Trinity College and University.&quot; It should not be confused with a number of mainstream academic institutions with similar names (see Trinity College).

Trinity College and University offered bachelor&#x27;s degrees on the basis of &quot;Prior Learning Assessment,&quot; advertising that a degree awarded on this basis could be completed in as little as two days&#x27; time. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees were priced at $675.

The name &quot;Trinity College and University&quot; is also used by a distance education institution based in Dover, Delaware, United States, with offices in Málaga, Spain and Islamabad, Pakistan. This institution is a known diploma mill now. and advertises that it awards degrees &quot;in any subject&quot; on the basis of &quot;practical experience&quot;.

==United Nations scandal==
In February 2007, the Associated Press reported that several employees of the United Nations had lost their jobs when it was revealed they had listed Trinity College and University degrees on their resumes. A representative of the UN was quoted as saying that one staff member&#x27;s misrepresentation of his Trinity credentials as being from a legitimate university was considered &quot;serious misconduct.&quot; The article described Trinity as a &quot;diploma-sales business&quot; and noted that the institution was &quot;actively pursuing the soldiers in Iraq&quot; as customers for college degrees.

In 1776, he received a commission as captain and paymaster of the Continental Army&#x27;s 1st New York Regiment, serving under his father-in-law Alexander McDougall (sometimes spelled MacDougall).

He was Judge Advocate General from 1777 to 1782. Among the cases he handled were prosecuting at the court-martial of Charles Lee for insubordination in 1778, and the 1779 court-martial of Benedict Arnold for corruption. He also presided at the trial of Major John André, serving on the 1780 board that convicted the major of spying and sentenced him to death by hanging, and was the board&#x27;s recorder.

<doc id="443575" wikidata="Q3363312" url="?curid=443575" title="Borel–Kolmogorov paradox">
<text>In probability theory, the Borel–Kolmogorov paradox (sometimes known as Borel&#x27;s paradox) is a paradox relating to conditional probability with respect to an event of probability zero (also known as a null set). It is named after Émile Borel and Andrey Kolmogorov.

== A great circle puzzle ==
Suppose that a random variable has a uniform distribution on a unit sphere. What is its conditional distribution on a great circle? Because of the symmetry of the sphere, one might expect that the distribution is uniform and independent of the choice of coordinates. However, two analyses give contradictory results. First, note that choosing a point uniformly on the sphere is equivalent to choosing the longitude formula_1 uniformly from formula_2 and choosing the latitude formula_3 from formula_4 with density formula_5. Then we can look at two different great circles:
# If the coordinates are chosen so that the great circle is an equator (latitude formula_6), the conditional density for a longitude formula_1 defined on the interval formula_2 is formula_9
# If the great circle is a line of longitude with formula_10, the conditional density for formula_3 on the interval formula_4 is formula_13

One distribution is uniform on the circle, the other is not. Yet both seem to be referring to the same great circle in different coordinate systems.

== Explanation and implications ==
In case (1) above, the conditional probability that the longitude &quot;λ&quot; lies in a set &quot;E&quot; given that &quot;φ&quot; = 0 can be written &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot; | &quot;φ&quot; = 0). Elementary probability theory suggests this can be computed as &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot; and &quot;φ&quot; = 0)/&quot;P&quot;(&quot;φ&quot; = 0), but that expression is not well-defined since &quot;P&quot;(&quot;φ&quot; = 0) = 0. Measure theory provides a way to define a conditional probability, using the limit of events &quot;R&quot;&quot;ab&quot; = {&quot;φ&quot; : &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;φ&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;} which are horizontal rings (curved surface zones of spherical segments) consisting of all points with latitude between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

The resolution of the paradox is to notice that in case (2), &quot;P&quot;(&quot;φ&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; | &quot;λ&quot; = 0) is defined using a limit of the events &quot;L&quot;&quot;cd&quot; = {&quot;λ&quot; : &quot;c&quot; &lt; &quot;λ&quot; &lt; &quot;d&quot;}, which are lunes (vertical wedges), consisting of all points whose longitude varies between &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;. So although &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot; | &quot;φ&quot; = 0) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;φ&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; | &quot;λ&quot; = 0) each provide a probability distribution on a great circle, one of them is defined using limits of rings, and the other using limits of lunes. Since rings and lunes have different shapes, it should be less surprising that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot; | &quot;φ&quot; = 0) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;φ&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; | &quot;λ&quot; = 0) have different distributions.


== Mathematical explication ==

=== Measure theoretic perspective ===

To understand the problem we need to recognize that a distribution on a continuous random variable is described by a density &quot;f&quot; only with respect to some measure &quot;μ&quot;. Both are important for the full description of the probability distribution. Or, equivalently, we need to fully define the space on which we want to define &quot;f&quot;.

Let Φ and Λ denote two random variables taking values in Ω1 = formula_14 respectively Ω2 = [−, ]. An event {Φ = &quot;φ&quot;, Λ = &quot;λ&quot;} gives a point on the sphere &quot;S&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) with radius &quot;r&quot;. We define the coordinate transform
:formula_15

for which we obtain the volume element
:formula_16

Furthermore, if either &quot;φ&quot; or &quot;λ&quot; is fixed, we get the volume elements
:formula_17

Let
:formula_18

denote the joint measure on formula_19, which has a density formula_20 with respect to formula_21 and let
:formula_22

If we assume that the density formula_20 is uniform, then
:formula_24

Hence, formula_25 has a uniform density with respect to formula_26 but not with respect to the Lebesgue measure. On the other hand, formula_27 has a uniform density with respect to formula_28 and the Lebesgue measure.

=== Proof of contradiction ===

Consider a random vector formula_29 that is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere formula_30.

We begin by parametrizing the sphere with the usual spherical polar coordinates:
:formula_31
where formula_32 and formula_33.

We can define random variables formula_34, formula_35 as the values of formula_36
under the inverse of this parametrization, or more formally using the arctan2 function:
:formula_37

Using the formulas for the surface area spherical cap and the spherical wedge, the surface of a spherical cap wedge is given by
:formula_38

Since formula_29 is uniformly distributed, the probability is proportional to the surface area, giving the joint cumulative distribution function
:formula_40

The joint probability density function is then given by
:formula_41
Note that formula_34 and formula_35 are independent random variables.

For simplicity, we won&#x27;t calculate the full conditional distribution on a great circle, only the probability that the random vector lies in the first octant. That is to say, we will attempt to calculate the conditional probability formula_44 with
:formula_45

We attempt to evaluate the conditional probability as a limit of conditioning on the events
:formula_46

As formula_34 and formula_35 are independent, so are the events formula_49 and formula_50, therefore
:formula_51

Now we repeat the process with a different parametrization of the sphere:
:formula_52
This is equivalent to the previous parametrization rotated by 90 degrees around the y axis.

Define new random variables
:formula_53

Rotation is measure preserving so the density of formula_54 and formula_55 is the same:
:formula_56.

The expressions for and are:
:formula_57

Attempting again to evaluate the conditional probability as a limit of conditioning on the events
:formula_58

Using L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule and differentiation under the integral sign:
:formula_59

This shows that the conditional density cannot be treated as conditioning on an event of probability zero, as explained in Conditional probability#Conditioning on an event of probability zero.

<doc id="443584" wikidata="Q2094335" url="?curid=443584" title="United States Attorney">
<text>United States attorneys are officials of the U.S. Department of Justice who serve as the chief federal law enforcement officers in each of the 94 U.S. federal judicial districts. Each U.S. attorney serves as the United States&#x27; chief federal criminal prosecutor in their judicial district and represents the U.S. federal government in civil litigation in federal and state court within their geographic jurisdiction. U.S. attorneys must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, after which they serve four-year terms.

Currently, there are 93 U.S. attorneys in 94 district offices located throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. One U.S. attorney is assigned to each of the judicial districts, with the exception of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, where a single U.S. attorney serves both districts. Each U.S. attorney is the chief federal law enforcement officer within a specified jurisdiction, acting under the guidance of the &quot;United States Attorneys&#x27; Manual&quot;. They supervise district offices with as many as 350 assistant U.S. attorneys (AUSAs) and as many as 350 support personnel.

U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Offices are staffed mainly by assistant U.S. attorneys (AUSA). Often colloquially called &quot;federal prosecutors&quot;, assistant U.S. attorneys are government lawyers who act as prosecutors in federal criminal trials and as the United States federal government&#x27;s lawyers in civil litigation in which the United States is a party. In carrying out their duties as prosecutors, AUSAs have the authority to investigate persons, issue subpoenas, file formal criminal charges, plea bargain with defendants, and grant immunity to witnesses and accused criminals.

U.S. attorneys and their offices are part of the Department of Justice. U.S. attorneys receive oversight, supervision, and administrative support services through the Justice Department&#x27;s Executive Office for United States Attorneys. Selected U.S. attorneys participate in the Attorney General&#x27;s Advisory Committee of United States Attorneys.

==History and statutory authority==
The Office of the United States Attorney was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789, along with the office of Attorney General and United States Marshal. The same act also specified the structure of the Supreme Court of the United States and established inferior courts making up the United States Federal Judiciary, including a district court system. Thus, the office of U.S. Attorney is older than the Department of Justice. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for the appointment in each judicial district of a &quot;Person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States...whose duty it shall be to prosecute in each district all delinquents for crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil actions in which the United States shall be concerned...&quot;
Prior to the existence of the Department of Justice, the U.S. attorneys were independent of the attorney general, and did not come under the AG&#x27;s supervision and authority until 1870, with the creation of the Department of Justice.

==Appointment==
U.S. attorneys are appointed by the president of the United States for a term of four years, with appointments subject to confirmation by the Senate. A U.S. attorney continues in office, beyond the appointed term, until a successor is appointed and qualified. By law, each United States attorney is subject to removal by the president. The attorney general has had the authority since 1986 to appoint interim U.S. attorneys to fill a vacancy.

===United States attorneys controversy===
The governing statute, provided, up until March 9, 2006:

 (c) A person appointed as United States attorney under this section may serve until the earlier of—
:(1) the qualification of a United States attorney for such district appointed by the President under section 541 of this title; or
:(2) the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General under this section.
(d) If an appointment expires under subsection (c)(2), the district court for such district may appoint a United States attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled. The order of appointment by the court shall be filed with the clerk of the court.

On March 9, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005 which amended Section 546 by striking subsections (c) and (d) and inserting the following new subsection:

 (c) A person appointed as United States attorney under this section may serve until the qualification of a United States Attorney for such district appointed by the President under section 541 of this title.

This, in effect, extinguished the 120-day limit on interim U.S. attorneys, and their appointment had an indefinite term. If the president failed to put forward any nominee to the Senate, then the Senate confirmation process was avoided, as the Attorney General-appointed interim U.S. attorney could continue in office without limit or further action. Related to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, in March 2007 the Senate and the House voted to re-instate the 120-day term limit on interim attorneys via the Preserving United States Attorney
Independence Act of 2007.
The bill was signed by President George W. Bush, and became law in June 2007.

===History of interim U.S. attorney appointments===
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D, California), summarized the history of interim United States Attorney appointments, on March 19, 2007 in the Senate.
==Role of U.S. attorneys==
The U.S. attorney is both the primary representative and the administrative head of the &quot;Office of the U.S. Attorney&quot; for the district. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office (USAO) is the chief prosecutor for the United States in criminal law cases, and represents the United States in civil law cases as either the defendant or plaintiff, as appropriate. However, they are not the only ones that may represent the United States in Court. In certain circumstances, using an action called a &quot;qui tam&quot;, any U.S. citizen, provided they are represented by an attorney, can represent the interests of the United States, and share in penalties assessed against guilty parties.

As chief federal law enforcement officers, U.S. attorneys have authority over all federal law enforcement personnel within their districts and may direct them to engage, cease or assist in investigations. In practice, this has involved command of Federal Bureau of Investigation assets but also includes other agencies under the Department of Justice, such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Drug Enforcement Administration. Additionally, U.S. attorneys cooperate with other non-DOJ law enforcement agencies – such as the United States Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement – to prosecute cases relevant to their jurisdictional areas.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia has the additional responsibility of prosecuting local criminal cases in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the equivalent of a municipal court for the national capital. The Superior Court is a federal Article I court.

The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) provides the administrative support for the 93 United States attorneys (encompassing 94 United States Attorney offices, as the Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands has a single U.S. attorney for both districts), including:
* General executive assistance and direction,
* Policy development,
* Administrative management direction and oversight,
* Operational support,
* Coordination with other components of the United States Department of Justice and other federal agencies.

These responsibilities include certain legal, budgetary, administrative, and personnel services, as well as legal education.

The EOUSA was created on April 6, 1953, by Attorney General Order No. 8-53 to provide for close liaison between the Department of Justice in Washington, DC, and the 93 U.S. attorneys located throughout the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was organized by Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge James R. Browning, who also served as its first chief.

<text>Henry Martyn Hoyt, Sr. (June 8, 1830 – December 1, 1892) was an American lawyer and politician and the 18th governor of Pennsylvania from 1879 to 1883, as well as an officer in the Union army during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Henry M. Hoyt was born in Kingston, Pennsylvania, the son of Ziba Hoyt (b. September 1788, Connecticut – d. December 1853, Luzerne County, PA) and Nancy (née Herbert) Hoyt, who had moved to Luzerne County after the Revolutionary War. Henry M. Hoyt was grandson of Daniel and Ann (Gunn) Hoyt, and nephew of Levi Hoyt. They were descended from Walter Hoyt (1616–1698), who was born in West Hatch, Somerset, England, and settled in the Connecticut Colony.

He attended lower education at Wyoming Seminary. He started higher-level classes at Lafayette College, where he studied from 1845 until 1848. He transferred to Williams College, graduating in 1849 with Phi Beta Kappa honors, as a member of Kappa Alpha Society.

==Career==
After graduating from Williams College, he returned to Pennsylvania, where from 1851 to 1853 he taught Mathematics at Wyoming Seminary. Hoyt first held elected office as a district attorney. A member of the Whig Party, Hoyt participated in John Fremont&#x27;s 1856 presidential campaign.

===Military career===
As a soldier in the Civil War, Hoyt was initially commissioned as Lieutenant Colonel, then as colonel of the 52nd Pennsylvania Infantry. He led it during the Peninsula Campaign and subsequent actions of the Army of the Potomac until January 1863, when the regiment was ordered to Charleston, South Carolina.

He participated in the siege of Morris Island under Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore. Hoyt led troops in a rare night attack on Fort Johnson, stealthily arriving in the darkness via boats. He initially captured the fort, but was unable to hold it for lack of reinforcements. He and many of his men were captured in a Confederate counterattack. After being confined in a prisoner-of-war camp in Macon, Georgia, Hoyt was taken back to Charleston. He escaped briefly before being recaptured.

Upon his eventual exchange, he rejoined his regiment. He served with them until the close of the war, when he was mustered out with the rank of brevet brigadier general.

===Law career===
After the war, Hoyt returned to his law practice. After briefly serving as a judge, he rose in influence with the Republican party and chaired the state Republican party from 1875 to 1876.

In 1878, he won the governor&#x27;s seat, the third consecutive Civil War general to hold the office. During his term, the debt of the state was reduced to $10,000,000, and refunded at the rate of three per cent.

Hoyt wrote two books: &quot;Controversy between Connecticut and Pennsylvania&quot; (Philadelphia, 1879), about their competing colonial claims settled after the Revolutionary War; and &quot;Protection vs. Free Trade&quot; (New York, 1885).

==Personal life==
On September 25, 1855, Hoyt married Mary Elizabeth Loveland (b. April 1833 – d. October 1890 in Luzerne County), the daughter of Elijah and Mary (née Buckingham) Loveland. They had two children together:
*Henry Martyn Hoyt, Jr. (1856–1910) became solicitor general
*Maud Buckingham Hoyt (1859–1931)

Hoyt died in Wilkes-Barre on December 1, 1892. He is buried next to his wife in the Forty Fort Cemetery in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.

===Descendants===
Hoyt was also the grandfather of the poet Elinor Wylie, the daughter of Henry Martyn Hoyt, Jr. His daughter was a poet, too: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/helen-hoyt?mc_cid=b202317e81&amp;mc_eid=15eb358e88

==Honors==
*In 1881 Hoyt was awarded the honorary degree of LL. D. from the University of Pennsylvania and also from Lafayette College.
*A residence hall in the South Halls section of the Pennsylvania State University at the University Park campus is named for him.

<doc id="443592" wikidata="Q205225" url="?curid=443592" title="Interest rate option">
<text>An interest rate option is a specific financial derivative contract whose value is based on interest rates. Its value is tied to an underlying interest rate, such as the yield on 10 year treasury notes.

Similar to equity options, there are two types of contracts: calls and puts. A call gives the bearer the right, but not the obligation, to benefit off a rise in interest rates. A put gives the bearer the right, but not the obligation, to profit from a decrease in interest rates.

The exchange of these interest rate derivatives are monitored and facilitated by a central exchange such as those operated by CME Group.

<doc id="443594" wikidata="Q883224" url="?curid=443594" title="Robert E. Pattison">
<text>Robert Emory Pattison (December 8, 1850August 1, 1904) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 19th governor of Pennsylvania from 1883 to 1887 and 1891 to 1895. Pattison was the only Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania between the start of the American Civil War and the start of the Great Depression.

==Life and career==
Robert E. Pattison was born at Quantico in Somerset County, Maryland, on December 8, 1850.
His family had been in Dorchester County, Maryland, for three generations. His parents were Robert Henry Pattison, a Methodist Episcopalian minister, and Catherine Woolford. He moved with his family to Philadelphia when he was five and was educated in the public schools, graduating from the high school of that city as the valedictorian of his class.
He practiced law from 1872 to 1877 and was elected Controller of the city of Philadelphia in 1880. He was the Democratic candidate for governor at the young age of 32, and, with little experience in public office, took the governor&#x27;s office back from a succession of Republican administrations. Under the constitution of 1874, Pennsylvania governors, now serving a 4-year term, were prevented from seeking two consecutive terms. Pattison&#x27;s opponent in the 1882 election, James Addams Beaver, held the post for a term before Pattison sought the office once again in 1890. During his second term, he ordered state militia to halt the Homestead Strike.

A key to Pattison&#x27;s success was his close relationship with the Democratic leader of Philadelphia, attorney Lewis Cassidy. He studied law under Cassidy, and was admitted to the bar at the age of 21. Although he campaigned as an anti-political machine reformer, he appointed Cassidy as Attorney General of Pennsylvania. He did constant battle with machine interests, and in his second term enacted legislation providing for a secret ballot for voters in all elections.

A number of other reforms were carried out under Pattison. 

Pattison&#x27;s feat of being elected to a state governorship at the age of 31 was matched in the 20th century only by Harold Stassen, elected governor of Minnesota in 1938. Bill Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas at the age of 32.

Pattison&#x27;s success at a young age led him to be promoted for other offices. He was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Mayor of Philadelphia in 1895, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in 1896, and an unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial nominee for a third term as governor in 1902.

Pattison was an elected member of the American Philosophical Society.

He died at his home in the Overbrook neighborhood of Philadelphia on August 1, 1904. The &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary of Pattison credited the stress of his final gubernatorial campaign against Samuel W. Pennypacker with leading to his death. He is buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
Pattison Avenue in South Philadelphia is named after him. In the late 1970s, an award to a graduating senior at Central High School of Philadelphia was established in his honor. Pattison graduated from Central High School and was the valedictorian for his class.

<text>James Addams Beaver (October 21, 1837 – January 31, 1914) was an American attorney, recruiter and field commander of Pennsylvania Infantry who was wounded four times during the American Civil War, and politician who served as the 20th governor of Pennsylvania from 1887 to 1891. He also served as the acting president of the Pennsylvania State University from 1906 to 1908.

==Early life and education==
Born in Millerstown, Pennsylvania, James was educated by his mother (his father having died in 1840) until 1846, when the family removed to Belleville, and he was sent to school. In 1852 he entered Pine Grove Academy, and in 1854 joined the junior class in Jefferson College. Beaver graduated from Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College), in 1856.

After graduation, he read law in the office of H.N. McAllister, at Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and was taken into partnership by him almost as soon as he was of age. During this period of his life, he joined a local military company — the &quot;Bellefonte Fencibles,&quot; under Capt. Andrew G. Curtin, afterward war governor of Pennsylvania. He made a thorough study of tactics, and, when President Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers to suppress the rebellion in 1861, he was second lieutenant of the company which promptly marched for the defence of the national capital.

==Military service==
On the organization of the 45th Pennsylvania volunteers, he became its lieutenant-colonel, and first saw active service in the neighborhood of Hilton Head and Port Royal, South Carolina. A new call for volunteers was issued in 1862 and Lieut-Col. Beaver was commissioned colonel of the 148th Pennsylvania volunteers, recruited in the vicinity of his home. He had by this time developed high qualities as a disciplinarian, and his men made it their boast that they were often mistaken for regulars. The regiment joined the army of the Potomac just after the Battle of Fredericksburg, was assigned to Hancock&#x27;s corps, and first met the enemy at the Battle of Chancellorsville (2 and 3 May 1863), where it held an advanced position, and lost very heavily, Col. Beaver being among the wounded.

He had not recovered when the third call for troops was issued; but, at his own request, he was placed on recruiting service, in command of Camp Curtin. He was able to rejoin his regiment just before the Battle of Gettysburg, but, still weak from his wound, was not permitted to take command during the fight. He led his regiment throughout the Wilderness Campaign in May 1864, and took part in the successful assault upon the confederate works at Spottsylvania Court House, his regiment being among the first to scale the earthworks. At the Battle of Cold Harbor (3 June 1864) he was left in command of the brigade, Gen. Brooke being wounded, and later he was himself slightly wounded, but not disabled, and remained at his post during the rest of the day, holding an advanced position close to the enemy&#x27;s works, and constantly under fire.

On 16 June 1864, he was again wounded while leading his brigade in the first assault upon the works at Petersburg. Returning to duty before his wound was fairly healed, he rode to the battlefield of Ream&#x27;s Station in an ambulance, and had scarcely reached the front and assumed command at the advanced line when his right leg was shattered by a rifle ball. Amputation of the right leg followed, and, although his life was saved, the 26-year-old was no longer capable of active military service. He was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers, 10 November 1864, and mustered out of service at his own request on 22 December of that year, refusing to remain in the army on light duty as he was urged to do. He repeatedly declined promotion that would have taken him away from his own regiment, feeling bound to remain with the men whom he had enlisted.

==Political career and later life==
Following the war, Beaver pursued his law career. He was elected a member of the board of trustees of the Pennsylvania State College in 1873, and took active part as a speaker in the campaigns of the Republican Party. He declined offers to run for public office until 1881 (including a spot as vice president on James Garfield&#x27;s Republican ticket). He lost to Robert Pattison, but, because the new state constitution of 1874 prohibited governors from serving multiple consecutive terms, Beaver ran again and served as governor for the four years between Pattison&#x27;s two non-consecutive terms. In 1895, he was appointed as one of the judges of the first state Superior Court, an office he held until his death in 1914. He was buried in Union Cemetery in Bellefonte. He was a prominent member of the Grand Army of the Republic.

Beaver Stadium and Beaver Hall, located on the University Park campus of Pennsylvania State University, as well as Beaver Avenue in State College are all named in his honor.
