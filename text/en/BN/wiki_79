<text>Tribal sovereignty in the United States is the concept of the inherent authority of Indigenous tribes to govern themselves within the borders of the United States.

The U.S. federal government recognized American Indian tribes as independent nations and came to policy agreements with them via treaties. As the U.S. accelerated its westward expansion, internal political pressure grew for &quot;Indian removal&quot;, but the pace of treaty-making grew regardless. The Civil War forged the U.S. into a more centralized and nationalistic country, fueling a &quot;full bore assault on tribal culture and institutions&quot;, and pressure for Native Americans to assimilate. In the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871, Congress prohibited any future treaties. This move was steadfastly opposed by Native Americans.

Currently, the U.S. recognizes tribal nations as domestic dependent nations and uses its own legal system to define the relationship between the federal, state, and tribal governments. The U.S. recognizes 574 tribal nations, 229 of which are in Alaska. The National Congress of American Indians explains, &quot;Native peoples and governments have inherent rights and a political relationship with the U.S. government that does not derive from race or ethnicity.&quot;

==Native American sovereignty and the Constitution==
The United States Constitution mentions Native American tribes three times:

* Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 states that &quot;Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States ... excluding Indians not taxed.&quot; According to Story&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the U.S. Constitution&quot;, &quot;There were Indians, also, in several, and probably in most, of the states at that period, who were not treated as citizens, and yet, who did not form a part of independent communities or tribes, exercising general sovereignty and powers of government within the boundaries of the states.&quot;
* Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that &quot;Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes&quot;, determining that Indian tribes were separate from the federal government, the states, and foreign nations; and
* The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2 amends the apportionment of representatives in Article I, Section 2 above.

These constitutional provisions, and subsequent interpretations by the Supreme Court (see below), are today often summarized in three principles of U.S. Indian law:
* Territorial sovereignty: Tribal authority on Indian land is organic and is not granted by the states in which Indian lands are located.
* Plenary power doctrine: Congress, and not the Executive Branch or Judicial Branch, has ultimate authority with regard to matters affecting the Indian tribes. Federal courts give greater deference to Congress on Indian matters than on other subjects.
* Trust relationship: The federal government has a &quot;duty to protect&quot; the tribes, implying (courts have found) the necessary legislative and executive authorities to effect that duty.

==Early history==

===The Marshall Trilogy, 1823–1832===

The Marshall Trilogy is a set of three Supreme Court decisions in the early nineteenth century affirming the legal and political standing of Indian nations.

* &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; (1823), holding that private citizens could not purchase lands from Native Americans.
* &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; (1831), holding the Cherokee nation dependent, with a relationship to the United States like that of a &quot;ward to its guardian&quot;.
* &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832), which laid out the relationship between tribes and the state and federal governments, stating that the federal government was the sole authority to deal with Indian nations.

===Indian Appropriations Act of 1871===

Originally, the United States had recognized the Indian Tribes as independent nations, but after the Civil War, the U.S. suddenly changed its approach.

The Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 had two significant sections. First, the Act ended United States recognition of additional Native American tribes or independent nations and prohibited additional treaties. Thus, it required the federal government no longer interact with the various tribes through treaties, but rather through statutes:

The 1871 Act also made it a federal crime to commit murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, arson, burglary, and larceny within any Territory of the United States.

===Empowerment of tribal courts, 1883===

On April 10, 1883, five years after establishing Indian police powers throughout the various reservations, the Indian Commissioner approved rules for a &quot;court of Indian offenses&quot;. The court provided a venue for prosecuting criminal charges but afforded no relief for tribes seeking to resolve civil matters. Another five years later, Congress began providing funds to operate the Indian courts.

While U.S. courts clarified some of the rights and responsibilities of states and the federal government toward the Indian nations within the new nation&#x27;s first century, it was almost another century before United States courts determined what powers remained vested in the tribal nations. In the interim, as a trustee charged with protecting their interests and property, the federal government was legally entrusted with ownership and administration of the assets, land, water, and treaty rights of the tribal nations.

===&quot;United States v. Kagama&quot; (1886)===
The 1871 Act was affirmed in 1886 by the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;United States v. Kagama&quot;, which affirmed that the Congress has plenary power over all Native American tribes within its borders by rationalization that &quot;The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful ... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell&quot;. The Supreme Court affirmed that the U.S. Government &quot;has the right and authority, instead of controlling them by treaties, to govern them by acts of Congress, they being within the geographical limit of the United States. ... The Indians owe no allegiance to a State within which their reservation may be established, and the State gives them no protection.&quot;

===The General Allotment Act (Dawes Act), 1887===

Passed by Congress in 1887, the &quot;Dawes Act&quot; was named for Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts, Chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Indian Affairs Committee. It came as another crucial step in attacking the tribal aspect of the Indians of the time. In essence, the act broke up the land of most all tribes into modest parcels to be distributed to Indian families, and those remaining were auctioned off to white purchasers. Indians who accepted the farmland and became &quot;civilized&quot; were made American citizens. But the Act itself proved disastrous for Indians, as much tribal land was lost, and cultural traditions destroyed. Whites benefited the most; for example, when the government made of Indian lands available in Oklahoma, 50,000 white settlers poured in almost instantly to claim it all (in a period of one day, April 22, 1889).

Evolution of relationships: The evolution of the relationship between tribal governments and federal governments has been glued together through partnerships and agreements. Also running into problems of course such as finances which also led to not being able to have a stable social and political structure at the helm of these tribes or states.

==Twentieth-century developments==
===Revenue and Indian Citizenship acts, 1924===
The Revenue Act of 1924 (), also known as the Mellon tax bill after U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, cut federal tax rates and established the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals, which was later renamed the United States Tax Court in 1942. The Revenue Act was applicable to incomes for 1924. The bottom rate, on income under $4,000, fell from 1.5% to 1.125% (both rates are after reduction by the &quot;earned income credit&quot;). A parallel act, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 (), granted all non-citizen resident Indians citizenship. Thus the Revenue Act declared that there were no longer any &quot;Indians, not taxed&quot; to be not counted for purposes of United States congressional apportionment. President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill into law.

===Indian Reorganization Act, 1934===
In 1934, the &quot;Indian Reorganization Act&quot;, codified as Title 25, Section 476 of the U.S. Code, allowed Indian nations to select from a catalogue of constitutional documents that enumerated powers for tribes and for tribal councils. Though the Act did not specifically recognize the Courts of Indian Offenses, 1934 is widely considered to be the year when tribal authority, rather than United States authority, gave the tribal courts legitimacy. John Collier and Nathan Margold wrote the solicitor&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Powers of Indian Tribes&quot; which was issued October 25, 1934, and commented on the wording of the Indian Reorganization Act. This opinion stated that sovereign powers inhered in Indian tribes except for where they were restricted by Congress. The opinion stated that &quot;Conquest has brought the Indian tribes under the control of Congress, but except as Congress has expressly restricted or limited the internal powers of sovereignty vested in the Indian tribes such powers are still vested in the respective tribes and may be exercised by their duly constituted organs of government.&quot;

===Public Law 280, 1953===

In 1953, Congress enacted Public Law 280, which gave some states extensive jurisdiction over the criminal and civil controversies involving Indians on Indian lands. Many, especially Indians, continue to believe the law unfair because it imposed a system of laws on the tribal nations without their approval.

In 1965, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that no law had ever extended provisions of the U.S. Constitution, including the right of habeas corpus, to tribal members brought before tribal courts. Still, the court concluded, &quot;it is pure fiction to say that the Indian courts functioning in the Fort Belknap Indian community are not in part, at least, arms of the federal government. Originally they were created by federal executive and imposed upon the Indian community, and to this day the federal government still maintains a partial control over them.&quot; In the end however, the Ninth Circuit limited its decision to the particular reservation in question and stated, &quot;it does not follow from our decision that the tribal court must comply with every constitutional restriction that is applicable to federal or state courts.&quot;

While many modern courts in Indian nations today have established full faith and credit with state courts, the nations still have no direct access to U.S. courts. When an Indian nation files suit against a state in U.S. court, they do so with the approval of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In the modern legal era, the courts and Congress have, however, further refined the often competing jurisdictions of tribal nations, states and the United States in regard to Indian law.

In the 1978 case of &quot;Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe&quot;, the Supreme Court, in a 6–2 opinion authored by Justice William Rehnquist, concluded that tribal courts do not have jurisdiction over non-Indians (the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at that time, Warren Burger, and Justice Thurgood Marshall filed a dissenting opinion). But the case left unanswered some questions, including whether tribal courts could use criminal contempt powers against non-Indians to maintain decorum in the courtroom, or whether tribal courts could subpoena non-Indians.

A 1981 case, &quot;Montana v. United States&quot;, clarified that tribal nations possess inherent power over their internal affairs, and civil authority over non-members on fee-simple lands within its reservation when their &quot;conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.&quot;

Other cases of those years precluded states from interfering with tribal nations&#x27; sovereignty. Tribal sovereignty is dependent on, and subordinate to, only the federal government, not states, under &quot;Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation&quot; (1980). Tribes are sovereign over tribal members and tribal land, under &quot;United States v. Mazurie&quot; (1975).

In &quot;Duro v. Reina&quot;, , the Supreme Court held that a tribal court does not have criminal jurisdiction over a non-member Indian, but that tribes &quot;also possess their traditional and undisputed power to exclude persons who they deem to be undesirable from tribal lands. ... Tribal law enforcement authorities have the power if necessary, to eject them. Where jurisdiction to try and punish an offender rests outside the tribe, tribal officers may exercise their power to detain and transport him to the proper authorities.&quot; In response to this decision, Congress passed the &quot;&#x27;Duro&quot; Fix&#x27;, which recognizes the power of tribes to exercise criminal jurisdiction within their reservations over all Indians, including non-members. The &quot;Duro&quot; Fix was upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Lara&quot;, .

===&quot;Iron Crow v. Oglala Sioux Tribe&quot; (1956)===
In &quot;Iron Crow v. Oglala Sioux Tribe&quot;, the United States Supreme Court concluded that two Oglala Sioux defendants convicted of adultery under tribal laws, and another challenging a tax from the tribe, were not exempted from the tribal justice system because they had been granted U.S. citizenship. It found that tribes &quot;still possess their inherent sovereignty excepting only when it has been specifically taken from them by treaty or Congressional Act&quot;. This means American Indians do not have exactly the same rights of citizenship as other American citizens. The court cited case law from a pre-1924 case that said, &quot;when Indians are prepared to exercise the privileges and bear the burdens of&quot; &quot;sui iuris&quot;, i.e. of one&#x27;s own right and not under the power of someone else, &quot;the tribal relation may be dissolved and the national guardianship brought to an end, but it rests with Congress to determine when and how this shall be done, and whether the emancipation shall be complete or only partial&quot; (&quot;U.S. v. Nice&quot;, 1916). The court further determined, based on the earlier &quot;Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock&quot; case, that &quot;It is thoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over Indians.&quot; The court held that, &quot;the granting of citizenship in itself did not destroy ... jurisdiction of the Indian tribal courts and ... there was no intention on the part of Congress to do so.&quot; The adultery conviction and the power of tribal courts were upheld.

Further, the court held that whilst no law had directly established tribal courts, federal funding &quot;including pay and other expenses of judges of Indian courts&quot; implied that they were legitimate courts. 

==Tribal governments today==

===Tribal courts===

At the dawn of the 21st century, the powers of tribal courts across the United States varied, depending on whether the tribe was in a Public Law 280 (PL280) state (Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin).

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1978 decision &quot;Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe&quot; that tribes have no jurisdiction over non-Indians. Tribal courts maintain much criminal jurisdiction over their members, and because of the &quot;Duro&quot; fix, also over non-member Indians regarding crime on tribal land. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 expanded the criminal jurisdiction of tribes over non-Indian perpetrators of domestic violence that occur in Indian Country when the victim is Indian.

The 1968 Indian Civil Rights Act limited tribal punishment to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine, but this was expanded by the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010.

While tribal nations do not enjoy direct access to U.S. courts to bring cases against individual states, as sovereign nations they do enjoy immunity against many lawsuits, unless a plaintiff is granted a waiver by the tribe or by congressional abrogation. The sovereignty extends to tribal enterprises and tribal casinos or gaming commissions. The Indian Civil Rights Act does not allow actions against an Indian tribe in federal court for deprivation of substantive rights, except for habeas corpus proceedings.

Tribal and pueblo governments today launch far-reaching economic ventures, operate growing law enforcement agencies, and adopt codes to govern conduct within their jurisdiction, while the United States retains control over the scope of tribal law making. Laws adopted by Native American governments must also pass the Secretarial Review of the Department of Interior through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

With crime twice as high on Indian lands, federal funding of tribal courts has been criticized by the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the Government Accountability Office as inadequate to allow them to perform necessary judicial functions, such as hiring officials trained in law, and prosecuting cases neglected by the federal government.

===Nation to nation: tribes and the federal government===
The United States Constitution specifically mentions American Indians three times. Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 and the Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment address the handling of &quot;Indians not taxed&quot; in the apportionment of the seats of the House of Representatives according to population and in so doing suggest that Indians need not &quot;be&quot; taxed. In Article I Section 8, Clause 3, Congress is empowered to &quot;regulate commerce with foreign nations…states…and with the Indian tribes.&quot; Technically, Congress has no more power over Indian nations than it does over individual states. In the 1970s, Native American self-determination replaced Indian termination policy as the official United States policy towards Native Americans. Self-determination promoted the ability of tribes to self-govern and make decisions concerning their people. In dealing with Indian policy, a separate agency, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been in place since 1824.

The idea that tribes have an inherent right to govern themselves is at the foundation of their constitutional status – the power is not delegated by congressional acts. Congress can, however, limit tribal sovereignty. Unless a treaty or federal statute removes a power, however, the tribe is assumed to possess it. Current federal policy in the United States recognizes this sovereignty and stresses the government-to-government relations between the United States and Federally recognized tribes. However, most Native American land is held in trust by the United States, and federal law still regulates the economic rights of tribal governments and political rights. Tribal jurisdiction over persons and things within tribal borders are often at issue. While tribal criminal jurisdiction over Native Americans is reasonably well settled, tribes are still striving to achieve criminal jurisdiction over non-Native persons who commit crimes in Indian Country. This is largely due to the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in 1978 in &quot;Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe&quot; that tribes lack the inherent authority to arrest, try and convict non-Natives who commit crimes on their lands (see below for additional discussion on this point.)

As a result of a pair of treaties in 1830s, two tribal nations (the Cherokee and Choctaw) each have the right to send non-voting members to the United States House of Representatives (similar to a non-state U.S. territory or the federal district); the Choctaw have never exercised their right to do so since they were given the power and the Cherokee had not done so until appointing a delegate in 2019, though this delegate has not been accepted by Congress.

===Tribal state relations: sovereign within a sovereign===
Another dispute over American Indian government is its sovereignty versus that of the states. The federal U.S. government has always been the government that makes treaties with Indian tribes – not individual states. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states that &quot;Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes&quot;. This determined that Indian tribes were separate from the federal or state governments and that the states did not have power to regulate commerce with the tribes, much less regulate the tribes. The states and tribal nations have clashed over many issues such as Indian gaming, fishing, and hunting. American Indians believed that they had treaties between their ancestors and the United States government, protecting their right to fish, while non-Indians believed the states were responsible for regulating commercial and sports fishing. In the case &quot;Menominee Tribe v. United States&quot; in 1968, it was ruled that &quot;the establishment of a reservation by treaty, statute or agreement includes an implied right of Indians to hunt and fish on that reservation free of regulation by the state&quot;. States have tried to extend their power over the tribes in many other instances, but federal government ruling has continuously ruled in favor of tribal sovereignty. A seminal court case was &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;. Chief Justice Marshall found that &quot;England had treated the tribes as sovereign and negotiated treaties of alliance with them. The United States followed suit, thus continuing the practice of recognizing tribal sovereignty. When the United States assumed the role of protector of the tribes, it neither denied nor destroyed their sovereignty.&quot; As determined in the Supreme Court case &quot;United States v. Nice&quot; (1916), U.S. citizens are subject to all U.S. laws even if they also have tribal citizenship.

In July 2020, the U.S Supreme Court ruled in &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot; that the state of Oklahoma acted outside its jurisdiction when trying a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in 1997 for rape and that the case should have been tried in federal court since Congress had never officially dissolved the reservation in question. The ruling&#x27;s expansion of jurisdiction sovereignty also opened the possibility for Native Americans to obtain more power in alcohol regulation and casino gambling.

Similar to the promised non-voting tribal delegates in the United States House of Representatives, the Maine House of Representatives maintains three state-level non-voting seats for representatives of the Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and the Penobscot. Two of the seats are currently not filled in protest over issues of tribal sovereignty and rights.

== Tribal sovereignty over land and natural resources ==
Following industrialization, the 1800s brought many challenges to tribal sovereignty over tribal members&#x27; occupied lands in the United States. In 1831, &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; established a trust relationship between the United States and tribal territories. This gave the U.S. federal government primary jurisdictional authority over tribal land use, while maintaining tribal members&#x27; rights to reside on their land and access its resources. Similarly, in 1841, a treaty between the U.S. federal government and the Mole Lake Band of Sokaogon Chippewa resulted in the Chippewa ceding extensive lands to the U.S., but maintaining usufructuary rights to fishing, hunting, and gathering in perpetuity on all ceded land.

Wartime industry of the early 1900s introduced uranium mining and the need for weapons testing sites, for which the U.S. federal government often selected former and current tribal territories in the southwestern deserts. Uranium mines were constructed upstream of Navajo and Hopi reservations in Arizona and Nevada, measurably contaminating Native American water supply through the 1940s and 1950s with lasting impacts to this day. The Nevada desert was also a common nuclear testing site for the U.S. military through World War II and the Cold War, the closest residents being Navajo Nation members.

In 1970, President Richard Nixon established the federal government&#x27;s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1974, the EPA became the first U.S. federal agency to release an Indian Policy, which established the model of environmental federalism operational today. Under this model, the federal EPA sets water, air, and waste disposal standards, but delegates enforcement authority and the opportunity to design stricter environmental regulations to each state. Enforcement authority over Native American territory, however, remains under federal EPA jurisdiction, unless a given tribe applies for and is granted Treatment as State (TAS) status.

With the emergence of environmental justice movements in the United States through the 1990s, President Bill Clinton released executive orders 12898 (1994) and 13007 (1996). EO 12898 affirmed disparate impacts of climate change as stratified by socioeconomic status; EO 13007 ordered the protection of Native American cultural sites. Since the passage of EO 12898 and EO 13007, tribal prosecutors have litigated extensively against the federal government and industry polluters over land use and jurisdiction with varying degrees of success.

In 2007, the U.N. adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (&quot;The Declaration&quot;), despite the United States voting against it along with Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In 2010, President Barack Obama revisited The Declaration and declared that the U.S. government now supported it; however, as of December 2022, the requirements of The Declaration have still not been adopted into U.S. law. As recently as 2015, the Gold King Mine contaminated three million gallons of water in the Colorado River which serves as drinking water for the Navajo and Hopi downstream. The federal EPA appropriated $156,000 in reparations for Gold King Mine, while the Flint, Michigan water crisis in 2014 received $80 million in federal funds.

A recent challenge faced by Native Americans regarding land and natural resource sovereignty has been posed by the modern real estate market. While Native Nations have made substantial progress in land and resource sovereignty, such authority is limited to land classified as &#x27;Native American owned.&#x27; In the private real estate market, however, big industry polluters and hopeful miners have made a practice of buying out individual landowners in Native American residential areas, subsequently using that land to build mines or factories, which increase local pollution. There is not regulation or legislation in place to sufficiently curb this practice at the rate necessary to preserve Native American land and natural resources.

In 2023, the federally-recognized Resighini Rancheria of the Yurok People, Tolowa Dee-ni&#x27; Nation, and Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria announced that as territorial governments they have protected the Yurok-Tolowa-Dee-ni&#x27; Indigenous Marine Stewardship Area of of ocean waters and coastline reaching from Oregon to just south of Trinidad in the Redwood National and State Parks.

<text>Edward Langworthy (1738–1802) was an American Founding Father and teacher who was a delegate to the Continental Congress from Georgia. He signed the Articles of Confederation.

Langworthy was born in Savannah, Georgia, in 1738. Nothing is known of his ancestors since he was a foundling. He was raised in the Bethesda Orphan House in Savannah and was educated in the school there. He later taught in that same school. Since he was born only five years after James Oglethorpe shipped the first colonists to Georgia, his parents were likely included with those recruited from debtors&#x27; prisons or poorhouses.

Langworthy began working with Georgia&#x27;s Committee of Safety and was their secretary when they became a revolutionary Council of Safety on December 11, 1775. The Georgia assembly sent him to the Continental Congress in 1777, and he arrived in time to sign the Articles of Confederation. He served in the Congress until 1779.

Edward moved to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1785. He married a young lady named Wright, and the couple had four children. He also bought a part interest in a newspaper &quot;The Maryland Journal &amp; Baltimore Advertiser&quot; and became its editor. In 1787, he sold his interest and became an instructor at the Baltimore Academy.

In 1795, Langworthy was made the clerk of customs for Baltimore, a post he held until his death. He died of yellow fever on November 2, 1802, and was buried at the Old Episcopal Church. The church was torn down in 1891, and details of any re-interment are unknown.

<doc id="441625" wikidata="Q2467615" url="?curid=441625" title="Tommy Tallarico">
<text>Tommy Tallarico (born 1967 or 1968) is an American video game music composer, sound designer, and television producer. Since the 1990s, he has helmed audio production for numerous video games through his self-titled company. He co-hosted the television series &quot;Electric Playground&quot; and &quot;Reviews on the Run&quot; from 1997 until 2006. In 2002, he created Video Games Live (VGL), a global video game music orchestra.

In 2018, after he became the president of Intellivision Entertainment, the company began work on and sought investors for an original video game console named the Intellivision Amico, for which Tallarico was frequently present in pitch videos. He has since stepped down from his position as CEO but remains on the company&#x27;s board as president. the console has yet to be released. In 2020, it came to Tallarico&#x27;s attention that a sound effect he owned, by then widely known as the &quot;Roblox oof&quot;, was used in the video game &quot;Roblox&quot;. This led to a legal dispute which ended in 2022 with the removal of the sound effect from the game. Later in 2022, a video essay by British YouTuber Harry &quot;Hbomberguy&quot; Brewis documented an investigation into many disputed high-profile claims that Tallarico had made concerning his career, including his alleged involvement in creating the &quot;oof&quot; sound.

==Early life==
Tommy Tallarico grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts, later attending Cathedral High School. He told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in an interview he would take his father&#x27;s tape recorder to the arcade to record songs as a child. After graduating high school, Tallarico attended Western New England University for a year. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Tallarico moved to Southern California in 1991 to try and obtain a job in the video game industry. Tallarico took a job as a keyboard salesman at a Guitar Center in Santa Ana, California. On his first day, Tallarico met an executive from Virgin Mastertronic. Shortly after, Tallarico was given a job at Virgin as one of their play-testers.

==Career==
Tallarico&#x27;s first musical project at Virgin Interactive was for the Game Boy version of &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;. &quot;The main focus of writing video game music back then was it had to be simple and have a great melody,&quot; Tallarico said. Tallarico worked on a number of other games while at Virgin Interactive, including the Sega CD version of &quot;The Terminator&quot;.

===Tommy Tallarico Studios===
Tallarico continued working with Virgin Interactive as head of music and video division until 1994, when he went on to found Tommy Tallarico Studios. David Perry formed Shiny Entertainment at the same time, and the two studios collaborated on &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; and &quot;MDK&quot;. In 2005, Tallarico wrote part of an orchestral score for &quot;Advent Rising&quot; performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

In September 1999, the &quot;oof&quot; sound effect was created for the game &quot;Messiah&quot; during its development, with the involvement of sound designer Joey Kuras (then employed at Tallarico Studios) and, potentially, Tallarico. Tallarico has at times claimed that Kuras created the sound, that it was a collaboration between the pair, and that he created it himself. The sound effect was subsequently used in &quot;Roblox&quot; from 2006 to 2020, played after a character died in-game, and became an iconic part of the game after its adoption by meme culture. Tallarico, who claims ownership of the sound, disputed &quot;Roblox&quot;&#x27;s use of it in June 2019. This dispute ended in July 2022 when the Roblox Corporation pulled the sound from all games on its platform.

===Television===
In 1997, Victor Lucas, founder of the &quot;Electric Playground&quot;, started Electric Playground TV with Tallarico, which provided gaming news and reviews. In 2002, the reviews section of &quot;Electric Playground&quot;, &quot;Reviews on the Run&quot;, was spun-off into its own program, which Tallarico and Lucas hosted as well. In the U.S., &quot;Reviews on the Run&quot; was broadcast on G4 TV as &quot;Judgment Day&quot;. In 2006, Tallarico began to spend less time on the show owing to other projects, missing almost all of 2007 and 2008. In 2009, Scott Jones took over his spot as full-time co-host with Victor Lucas.

===Music concerts===
In 2002, Tallarico co-founded Video Games Live, a symphony orchestra concert series that plays music from video games, with Jack Wall. Tallarico hosted and played guitar for the shows. He also created the visuals—scenes from video games, as well as lights and lasers—that are played in sync with the music.

Tallarico has produced seven VGL albums. The first album, &quot;Video Games Live Volume 1&quot;, debuted at No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 for Classical Music Crossovers. The second volume, &quot;Level 2&quot;, also sold as a Blu-ray DVD concert, debuted at No. 8 on the same Billboard list. In August 2013, Tallarico also opened a crowdfunding campaign for the third album &quot;Level 3&quot; on Kickstarter. According to Tallarico, Kickstarter was chosen as the means to fund the album because he had not been successful in attracting support from the recording industry, which he claimed was because music producers &quot;don&#x27;t think gamers are willing to pay for music&quot; and did not recognize the perceived &quot;culturally artistic significance&quot; of video game soundtracks. The &quot;Level 3&quot; campaign successfully met and surpassed its goal of $250,000.

In 2014, Tallarico and electronic dance music artist BT began working on &quot;Electronic Opus&quot;. As with &quot;Video Games Live&quot;, &quot;Electronic Opus&quot; presents EDM music alongside a symphony orchestra. They used Kickstarter to fund an album, with a goal of $200,000. The show opened at the Miami Winter Music Conference in 2015. In 2016, Tallarico co-produced the &quot;Capcom Live!&quot; concert tour with Shota Nakama.

In 2024, video game music composer Laura Intravia accused Tallarico of selling music arrangements from Video Games Live concerts that he did not own the rights to.

===Intellivision Entertainment===
Following the death of Keith Robinson in 2017, founder of Intellivision Productions, Tallarico purchased a stake in the company from the estate. In May 2018, Intellivision Entertainment was re-formed with him as president. In the winter of that year, he announced the intent for the company to release the Intellivision Amico with the target of October 2020. As of July 2022, it is reportedly still being worked on.

As of September 2022, the Amico has been delayed at least three times. The console has been viewed very negatively by critics, drawing criticism for its delays, fundraising tactics, and use of NFTs. The status of the console has been described as &quot;grim&quot; by TechRaptor and compared to a car crash by &quot;Kotaku&quot;.

In February 2022, Tallarico stepped down from his role as CEO of Intellivision, remaining on board as the company&#x27;s president and largest shareholder. He was replaced by the company&#x27;s former chief revenue officer Phil Adam. As of May 2024, the Amico has not been released.

===Game Audio Network Guild===
In 2002, Tallarico founded the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.), a non-profit to recognize achievements in video game music and audio, and served as its CEO and chairman of the board. The guild hosts annual awards for achievement in game audio.

===Misleading claims===
In November 2022, British YouTuber Harry &quot;Hbomberguy&quot; Brewis published a video essay which documented many of the high-profile claims that Tallarico had made concerning his career—including the number of video games he worked on, the number of Guinness World Records he earned, being the creator of the &quot;oof&quot; sound effect in his &quot;Roblox&quot; legal dispute, and being the first American to work on the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise—and concluded many were either exaggerations or knowingly false.

==Personal life==
Tallarico is vegan, and advocates for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, including donating music for the PETA browser game &quot;Super Tofu Boy&quot; in 2010. In interviews, he has said that Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler (whose real name is Steven Tallarico) is his cousin.

According to the &quot;LA Times&quot;, his home in San Juan Capistrano &quot;looks as if a 12-year-old with a huge bank account went wild&quot;, including a life-size Indiana Jones, several &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, and a statue of Merlin. Tallarico has falsely claimed that the house had at one point been featured on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;. In February 2024, he listed it for sale for $2,999,000; in October of the same year, real estate broker Redfin marked the house as having been sold.

<text>Operation Grapple was a set of four series of British nuclear weapons tests of early atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs carried out in 1957 and 1958 at Malden Island and Kiritimati (Christmas Island) in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in the Pacific Ocean (modern Kiribati) as part of the British hydrogen bomb programme. Nine nuclear explosions were initiated, culminating in the United Kingdom becoming the third recognised possessor of thermonuclear weapons, and the restoration of the nuclear Special Relationship with the United States in the form of the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

During the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys, which was merged with the American Manhattan Project in August 1943. Many of Britain&#x27;s top scientists participated in the Manhattan Project. After the war, fearing that Britain would lose its great power status, the British government resumed the atomic bomb development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research. The successful test of an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement, but Britain was still several years behind the United States, which had developed the more powerful thermonuclear weapons in the meantime. In July 1954, the Cabinet agreed that the maintenance of great power status required that Britain also develop thermonuclear weapons.

The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston produced three designs: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear weapon. The new designs had to be tested to demonstrate that they worked, hence Operation Grapple. The first series consisted of three tests in May and June 1957. In the first test, Grapple 1, a version of Green Granite known as Short Granite was dropped from a Vickers Valiant bomber flown by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard. The bomb&#x27;s yield was estimated at , far below its designed capability. Despite this, the test was hailed as a successful thermonuclear explosion, and the government did not confirm or deny reports that the UK had become a third thermonuclear power. The second test, Grapple 2, was of Orange Herald; its yield made it technically a megaton-range weapon, and the largest ever achieved by a single stage nuclear device. Grapple 3 tested Purple Granite, a version of Short Granite with some fixes; its yield was only .

A second test series was required, which consisted of a single test, Grapple X, in November 1957. This time the yield of exceeded expectations. It was a true hydrogen bomb, but most of its yield came from nuclear fission rather than nuclear fusion. In a third series with a single test, Grapple Y, in April 1958, another design was trialled. With an explosive yield of about , it remains the largest British nuclear weapon ever tested. The design of Grapple Y was notably successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear fusion reaction instead of fission of a heavy uranium-238 tamper—the dense material surrounding the core that kept the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency. Its yield had been closely predicted, indicating that its designers understood the process. A final series of four tests in August and September 1958, known as Grapple Z, tested techniques for boosting and making bombs immune to predetonation caused by nearby nuclear explosions. Two of these tests were detonations from balloons. A moratorium on testing came into effect in October 1958, and Britain never resumed atmospheric nuclear testing.

== Background ==

During the early part of the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys. At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project to create a combined British, American and Canadian project. The September 1944 Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period. Many of Britain&#x27;s top scientists participated in the Manhattan Project.

The British government had trusted that America would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery. On 16 November 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt&#x27;s successors, Clement Attlee and Harry S. Truman, signed a new agreement that replaced the Quebec Agreement&#x27;s requirement for &quot;mutual consent&quot; before using nuclear weapons with one for &quot;prior consultation&quot;, and there was to be &quot;full and effective cooperation in the field of atomic energy&quot;, but this was only &quot;in the field of basic scientific research&quot;. The United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) ended technical cooperation. The revelation of a Canadian spy ring that included British physicist Alan Nunn May while the bill was being prepared caused the United States Congress to add the death penalty for sharing &quot;restricted data&quot; with foreign nations. Efforts to restore the nuclear Special Relationship with the United States over the following decade were dogged by repeated spy scandals, including the arrest of Klaus Fuchs in 1950, and the defection of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean in 1951. Fearing a resurgence of American isolationism and Britain losing its great power status, the British government restarted its own development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research.

The successful test of an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement. Britain became the world&#x27;s third nuclear power, reaffirming the country&#x27;s status as a great power, but hopes that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to restore the Special Relationship were soon dashed. In November 1952, the United States conducted Ivy Mike, the first successful test of a true thermonuclear device or hydrogen bomb, a far more powerful form of nuclear weapons. Britain was therefore still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology. The Defence Policy Committee, chaired by Churchill and consisting of the senior Cabinet members, considered the political and strategic implications in June 1954, and concluded that &quot;we must maintain and strengthen our position as a world power so that Her Majesty&#x27;s Government can exercise a powerful influence in the counsels of the world.&quot; A Cabinet meeting on 27 July accepted this argument, and directed the Lord President to proceed with the development of thermonuclear weapons.

The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire was directed by William Penney, with William Cook as his deputy. The scientists at Aldermaston did not know how to build a hydrogen bomb, but produced three megaton-range designs that were named under the Rainbow code system: Orange Herald, a large nuclear fission weapon with an enriched uranium tamper; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design in which fusion occurred in layers of lithium-6 deuteride that alternated with layers of uranium-235; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design in which the majority of the yield came from thermonuclear burning. The British bomb designers used the terms &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Dick&quot; for the bomb&#x27;s primary and secondary stages respectively. The Tom would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode the Dick. Implicit in the creation of a hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested. Anthony Eden, who replaced Churchill as prime minister after the latter&#x27;s retirement on 5 April 1955, gave a radio broadcast in which he declared: &quot;You cannot prove a bomb until it has exploded. Nobody can know whether it is effective or not until it has been tested.&quot;

==Location==
Preliminary testing of boosted fission weapons, in which the fission yield was increased (&quot;boosted&quot;) through the addition of lithium-6 deuteride, was carried out in the Operation Mosaic tests in the Montebello Islands in May and June 1956. Orange Herald would also incorporate boosting. This was a sensitive matter; there was an agreement with Australia that no thermonuclear testing would be carried out there. The Australian Minister for Supply, Howard Beale, responding to rumours reported in the newspapers, asserted that &quot;the Federal Government has no intention of allowing any hydrogen bomb tests to take place in Australia. Nor has it any intention of allowing any experiments connected with hydrogen bomb tests to take place here.&quot; Although the devices tested in Mosaic were not thermonuclear, the tests &quot;were&quot; connected with hydrogen bomb development, so this prompted Eden to cable the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, detailing the nature and purpose of the tests. Eden promised that the yield of the second, larger test would not exceed two and a half times that of the Operation Hurricane test, which was . This was slightly higher than the limit previously agreed on tests in Australia. Menzies cabled his approval of the tests on 20 June 1955. In the event, the yield of the second test was .
Another test site was therefore required. For safety and security reasons, in the light of the &quot;Lucky Dragon&quot; incident, in which the crew of a Japanese fishing boat were exposed to radioactive fallout from the American Castle Bravo nuclear test, a large site remote from population centres was required. Various islands in the South Pacific and Southern Oceans were considered, along with Antarctica. The Admiralty suggested the Antipodes Islands, which are about southeast of New Zealand. In May 1955, the Minister for Defence, Selwyn Lloyd, concluded that the Kermadec Islands, which lie about northeast of New Zealand, would be suitable.

The Kermadec Islands were part of New Zealand, so Eden wrote to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sidney Holland, to ask for permission to use the islands. Holland refused, fearing an adverse public reaction in the upcoming 1957 general election in New Zealand. Despite reassurances and pressure from the British government, Holland remained firm. The search for a location continued, with Malden Island and McKean Island being considered. These were uninhabited islands claimed by both Britain and the United States. The former island became the frontrunner. Three Avro Shackletons from No. 240 Squadron were sent to conduct an aerial reconnaissance from Canton Island. It too was claimed by both the United States and Britain, and was jointly administered, so the Americans had to be informed. Holland agreed to send the survey ship to conduct a maritime survey.

Kiritimati (Christmas Island) was chosen as a base. It too was claimed by both Britain and the United States. Lying just north of the equator, it was a tropical island, largely covered in grass, scrub and coconut plantations. Temperatures were high, averaging during the day and at night, and humidity was very high, usually around 98 per cent. It lay from Tahiti, from Honolulu, from San Francisco and from Sydney. Its remoteness would dominate the logistic preparations for Operation Grapple. It had no indigenous population, but about 260 Gilbertese civilians lived on the island, in a village near Port London. They came from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, and worked the coconut plantations to produce copra. While most only stayed for a year or two, some had been on the island for a decade or more. Although Christmas Island was the main base, the area around Malden Island to the south was to be the site for the air-dropped tests, and Penrhyn Island, farther south was used as a technical monitoring site and as a weather station. A United States Air Force (USAF) special weapons monitoring team was based there, and the airstrip was improved to allow its supporting Douglas C-124 Globemaster II to use it.

South Pacific Air Lines (SPAL) had been granted permission by the United States and British governments to operate a flying boat service from Christmas Island. Patrick Dean asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Roger Makins to sound out the US government about terminating the contract. Makins reported in March 1956 that Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help so long as the dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, had been granted to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated if there was a military necessity to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, and that the United States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing the permit to operate from Christmas Island, regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation.

==Preparations==
===Organisation===

The test series was given the secret codename Operation Grapple. Rear Admiral Kaye Edden, the Commandant of the Joint Services Staff College, was approached to be the Task Force Commander (TFC), but he pointed out that the test series would primarily be a Royal Air Force (RAF) responsibility, and that it would be more appropriate to have an RAF officer in charge. Air Commodore Wilfrid Oulton was appointed task force commander on 6 February 1956, with the acting rank of air vice marshal from 1 March 1956. He secured Group Captain Richard Gething as his chief of staff.

Group Captain Cecil (Ginger) Weir was appointed Air Task Group Commander. RAF units assigned to Grapple included two English Electric Canberra bomber squadrons, Nos. 76 (the Nuclear Cloud Samplers) and 100; two Shackleton squadrons, Nos. 206 and 240; the Vickers Valiant bombers of No. 49 Squadron; a flight of search and rescue Westland Whirlwind helicopters of No. 22 Squadron; and No. 1325 Flight with three Dakota transport planes. All would come under the command of No. 160 Wing. Cook would be the scientific director. Oulton held the first meeting of the Grapple Executive Committee on New Oxford Street in London on 21 February 1956. With pressure mounting at home and abroad for a moratorium on testing, 1 April 1957 was set as the target date.

The light aircraft carrier was the operation control ship, and the flagship of Commodore Peter Gretton, the overall Naval Task Group commander. She embarked three Grumman TBF Avenger attack aircraft and four Royal Navy Whirlwind helicopters, along with two RAF Whirlwinds from No. 22 Squadron. Damage to the ship caused by a storm in the North Atlantic necessitated two days&#x27; of repairs in Kingston, Jamaica. By the time they were complete, there was insufficient time to sail around Cape Horn, so she traversed the Panama Canal, negotiating the narrowest part of the locks with just inches to spare. HMS &quot;Narvik&quot; reprised the role of control ship it had in Hurricane; but it also participated in Operation Mosaic, and had very little time to return to the Chatham Dockyard for a refit before heading out to Christmas Island for Grapple. In addition there were the frigates and , and Royal New Zealand Navy frigates and .

===Base development===

An advance party arrived on Christmas Island in an RAF Shackleton on 19 June 1956. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) supply ship &quot;Fort Beauharnois&quot; followed on 23 June, and became a temporary headquarters ship. It was ultimately joined by four more RFAs: the supply ship , ammunition ship , and tankers and . The role of headquarters ship was assumed by the Landing Ship, Tank (LST) , which arrived on 7 December 1956. She was fitted out with special radio equipment to contact the United Kingdom. She carried large refrigerators on her tank deck for storage of fresh and frozen produce, and could supply of potable water per day.

&quot;Narvik&quot; would have to spend long periods of time at Malden, but could not anchor there because of the steep grade of the ocean floor, so a deep-water mooring was desirable. &quot;Warrior&quot; needed one at Christmas Island, and moorings equipped with ship-to-shore telephones would be useful for the supply ships. Moorings were usually laid by boom defence vessels, but all the Royal Navy&#x27;s ones were coal burners, and they lacked the range to sail all the way to Christmas Island. An ocean-going salvage vessel, was acquired and commissioned as . It was sent to the Chatham Dockyard, where it was fitted with launching ramps for mooring chains and buoys, and its quarterdeck was modified to carry a DUKW, an amphibious truck.

The RAF and Royal Engineers improved the airfield to enable it to operate large, heavily loaded aircraft, and the port and facilities were improved to enable Christmas Island to operate as a base by 1 December 1956. It was estimated that of stores would be required for the construction effort alone. A dredge to clear the harbour was towed from Australia. Base development included improvements to the road system, and establishing an electricity supply, fresh water distillation plant, sewerage system and cold storage. The population of the island would peak at 3,000. The Army Task Group was commanded by Colonel J. E. S. (Jack) Stone; Colonel John Woollett was the garrison commander.
The construction force was built around 38 Corps Engineer Regiment, with the 48, 59 and 61 Field Squadrons, and 63 Field Park Squadron, and 12 and 73 Independent Field Squadrons. Part of the 25 Engineer Regiment also deployed. They were augmented by two construction troops from the Fiji Defence Force. With work on the plantations halted for the duration of Operation Grapple, the Gilbertese civilians were also employed on construction works and unloading the barges.

The troopship SS &quot;Devonshire&quot; sailed to the Central Pacific from East Asia. At Singapore she embarked 55 Field Squadron, which came from Korea, having been left behind there when the rest of 28 Engineer Regiment had returned to England after supporting the 1st Commonwealth Division in the Korean War. It also embarked Royal Marines Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) crews from Poole. Heavy engineering plant and equipment was loaded on the SS &quot;Reginald Kerr&quot;, an LST converted to civilian use. &quot;Devonshire&quot; docked in Fiji, where it took on some sappers who had flown ahead, and an RAF medical team. &quot;Devonshire&quot; reached Christmas Island on 24 December, followed by &quot;Reginald Kerr&quot;, with Woollett on board. By the end of December 1956, there were nearly 4,000 personnel on Christmas Island, including two women from the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services.

The first project, which was finished in October, was to rebuild the main runway at the airport to handle Valiants. This involved levelling a surface to extend it to long and wide. Some of access roads were built, and of scrub were cleared. Existing buildings were refurbished, and new ones erected to provided of building space. Twelve storage tanks were provided for petrol, diesel and aviation fuel, along with pumping stations.
The main camp consisted of over 700 tents and marquees, along with of hutted accommodation. The airbase was ready to accommodate the Valiants and their crews by March 1957. The port was managed by 51 Port Detachment. No. 504 Postal Unit, which had a detachment at Hickam Air Force Base, a USAF base in the American Territory of Hawaii, handled the receipt and despatch of mail, while No. 2 Special Air Formation Signal Troop provided communications support. The Royal Army Service Corps provided a butchery, a bakery and a laundry. They also operated DUKWs, which worked alongside the LCMs.

The Task Force received generous support from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force. RAF aircraft were allowed to overfly the United States, even when carrying radioactive or explosive materials, thereby obviating the need for winterisation for the more northerly journey over Canada. RAF ground crews were accommodated at Hickham and Travis Air Force Base in California, and a regular aerial courier service operated from Hickham to Christmas Island. &quot;Warrior&quot; had repairs made at Pearl Harbor, and the US Army base at Fort DeRussy gave Woollett use of its facilities.

About 60 Gilbertese civilians were relocated to Fanning Island in January 1957 on the copra ship &quot;Tungaru&quot;, and another 40 on the &quot;Tulgai&quot; the following month. By mid-March, 44 Gilbertese men, 29 women and 56 children remained. By the end of April, 31 of the men, and all the women and children had been taken to Fanning Island by RAF Handley Page Hastings aircraft. The civilians would remain there for the next three months, before returning to Christmas Island. During the later test series, the Gilbertese civilians remained on the island, marshalled in areas like the military personnel.

===Schedule===

Having decided on a location and date, there remained the matter of determining what would be tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but minor adjustments continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.

By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million (equivalent to £ million in ).

==Testing==
===&quot;Grapple&quot; series (3 tests)===

The first trial series consisted of three tests, named &quot;Grapple 1&quot;, &quot;Grapple 2&quot; and &quot;Grapple 3&quot;. All bombs were dropped and detonated over Malden Island, and exploded high in the atmosphere, rather than being detonated on the ground, in order to reduce the production of nuclear fallout. British scientists were aware that the Americans had been able to reduce fallout by obtaining most of the bomb yield from fusion instead of fission, but they did not yet know how to do this. Amid growing public concern about the dangers of fallout, particularly from strontium-90 entering the food chain, a committee chaired by Sir Harold Himsworth was asked to look into the matter. Another, in the United States chaired by Detlev Bronk, also investigated. They reported simultaneously on 12 June 1956. While differing on many points, they agreed that levels of strontium-90 were not yet sufficiently high to be of concern.

At an altitude of , the fireball would not touch the ground, thereby minimising fallout. The bombs would be detonated with a clockwork timer rather than a barometric switch. This meant that they had to be dropped from in order to detonate at the correct altitude. Grapple was Britain&#x27;s second airdrop of a nuclear bomb after the Operation Buffalo test at Maralinga on 11 October 1956, and the first of a thermonuclear weapon. The United States had not attempted this until the Operation Redwing Cherokee test on 21 May 1956, and the bomb had landed from the target. Aldermaston wanted the bomb within of the target, and Oulton felt that a good bomber crew could achieve that. A exclusion zone was established, covering the area between 3.5° North and 7.5° South and 154° and 163° West, which was patrolled by Shackletons.

No. 49 Squadron had eight Valiants, but only four deployed: XD818, piloted by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard, the squadron commander; XD822, piloted by Squadron Leader L. D. (Dave) Roberts; XD823, piloted by Squadron Leader Arthur Steele; and XD824, piloted by Squadron Leader Barney Millett. The other four Valiants remained at RAF Wittering, where they were used as courier aircraft for bomb components. The last components for Short Granite were delivered by Valiant courier on 10 May 1957—three days late owing to severe head winds between San Francisco and Honolulu. A full-scale rehearsal was held on 11 May, and on 14 May it was decided to conduct the Grapple 1 test the following day. The eight official observers—two each from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States—were flown from Honolulu to Christmas Island in an RAF Hastings, then to Malden Island in a Dakota, from whence a DUKW took them out to HMS &quot;Alert&quot;, the spectator ship. All but a small party were evacuated from Malden by HMS &quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;Narvik&quot; and &quot;Messina&quot; by 19:00 on 14 May. The rest were picked up by a helicopter from &quot;Warrior&quot; at 07:45 on 15 May. Oulton and Cook arrived on Malden by Dakota at 08:25, where they were met by a helicopter and taken to &quot;Narvik&quot;.
The Grapple 1 mission was flown by Hubbard in XD818, with Millett and XD824 as the &quot;grandstand&quot; observation aircraft. The two bombers took off from Christmas Island at 09:00. The bomb was dropped from off the shore of Malden Island at 10:38 local time on 15 May 1957. Hubbard missed the target by . The bomb&#x27;s yield was estimated at , far below its designed capability. Penney cancelled the Green Granite test and substituted a new weapon codenamed Purple Granite. This was identical to Short Granite, but with some minor modification to its Dick: additional uranium-235 was added, and the outer layer was replaced with aluminium.

Despite its failure, the Grapple 1 test was hailed as a successful thermonuclear explosion, and the government did not confirm or deny reports that the UK had become a third thermonuclear power. When documents on the series began to be declassified in the 1990s, they created a spirited debate among nuclear historians. Norman Dombey and Eric Grove denounced the Grapple tests in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; in 1992 as a hoax intended to deceive the Americans into resuming nuclear cooperation, but others, like the British nuclear weapons historian John Bayliss, pointed out that false reports would not have fooled the American observers, who helped to analyse samples from the radioactive cloud.
The next test was Grapple 2, of Orange Herald (small). For this test, two Fijian official observers were added. A detachment of 39 Fijian Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ratings who had been on board RNZN &quot;Pukaki&quot; and &quot;Roititi&quot; was transferred to HMS &quot;Warrior&quot;. This time there were also media representatives present on HMS &quot;Alert&quot;, including Chapman Pincher and William Connor. Orange Herald bomb components arrived in three separate loads on 13 May. Assembling them took two weeks.

The bomb was dropped by XD822, piloted by Roberts, while XD823, piloted by Steele, acted as the grandstand aircraft. This bomb was dropped at 10:44 local time on 31 May. After the bomb was released, Roberts made the standard 60° banked turn to get away, but his accelerometer failed, and the aircraft went into a high speed stall. This was potentially disastrous, but through skilful flying Roberts was able to recover from the stall and use the mechanical accelerometer to complete the manoeuvre.

The yield was the largest ever achieved by a single stage device. This made it technically a megaton-range weapon; but it was close to Corner&#x27;s estimate for an unboosted yield, there were doubts that the lithium-6 deuteride had contributed at all. This was attributed to Rayleigh–Taylor instability, which limited the compression of the light elements in the core. The bomb was hailed as a hydrogen bomb, and the fact that it was actually a large fission bomb was kept secret by the British government until the end of the Cold War.

The third and final test of the series was Grapple 3, the test of Purple Granite. This was dropped on 19 June by a Valiant XD823 piloted by Steele, with Millett and XD824 as the grandstand aircraft. The yield was a very disappointing , even less than Short Granite. The changes had not worked. &quot;We haven&#x27;t got it right&quot;, Cook told Oulton. &quot;We shall have to do it all again, providing we can do so before the ban comes into force; so that means as soon as possible.&quot;

===&quot;Grapple X&quot; (1 test)===
The next test series consisted of a single trial known as Grapple X. To save time and money, and as HMS &quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;Alert&quot; and &quot;Narvik&quot;, were unavailable, it was decided to drop the bomb off the southern tip of Christmas Island rather than off Malden Island. This was just from the airfield where 3,000 men were based. It required another major construction effort to improve the facilities, and some of those on Malden Island now had to be duplicated on Christmas Island. Works included 26 blast-proof shelters, a control room, and tented accommodation. To provide some means of chasing away intruders, the destroyer was allotted. HMNZS &quot;Rotoiti&quot; and &quot;Pukaki&quot; reprised their role as weather ships. A cargo ship, the SS &quot;Somersby&quot; was chartered to bring tentage and stores to Christmas Island. Monitoring equipment was set up on Malden Island and Fanning Island, and the observation posts on Penrhyn Island and Jarvis Island were re-established. Oulton noticed that:
While some ships and units such as No. 49 Squadron returned to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have to remain on the island for more than a year unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day a week off work, and sports such as football, cricket, tennis, volleyball, sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programmes.

The scientists at Aldermaston had not yet mastered the design of thermonuclear weapons. Knowing that much of the yield of American and Soviet bombs came from fission in the uranium-238 tamper, they had focused on what they called the &quot;lithium-uranium cycle&quot;, whereby neutrons from the fission of uranium would trigger fusion, which would produce more neutrons to induce fission in the tamper. However, this is not the most important reaction. Corner and his theoretical physicists at Aldermaston argued that Green Granite could be made to work by increasing compression and reducing Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The first step would be achieved with an improved Tom. The Red Beard Tom was given an improved high explosive supercharge, a composite uranium-235 and plutonium core, and a beryllium tamper, thereby increasing its yield to . The Dick was greatly simplified; instead of the fourteen layers in Short Granite, it would have just three. This was called Round A; a five-layer version was also mooted, which was called Round B. A diagnostic round, Round C, was also produced. It had the same three layers as Round A, but an inert layer instead of lithium deuteride. Grapple X would test Round A. Components of Rounds A and C were delivered to Christmas Island on 24, 27 and 29 October. On inspection, a fault was found in the Round A Tom, and the fissile core was replaced with the one from Round C.
This time there was no media presence, and only two foreign observers, Rear Admiral G. S. Patrick, the Director of the Atomic Energy Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations from the US Navy, and Brigadier General John. W. White, the Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, from the USAF. As the final preparations were being made for the test on 8 November, Oulton was advised at 01:00 that a Shackleton had sighted the SS &quot;Effie&quot;, an old Victory ship now flying the Liberian flag, in the exclusion zone. Eager to minimise publicity before this test, the British government had delayed sending out the Notice to Mariners, which had only been issued three weeks before. This failed to take into account the size of the Pacific Ocean; &quot;Effie&quot; had left its last port of call before it had been issued. The Shackleton kept &quot;Effie&quot; under observation while trying to contact her, and &quot;Cossack&quot; was sent to intercept. By 06:00, all was in readiness for the test, but there was no news of &quot;Effie&quot;. Finally, at 06:15, word was received from the Shackleton that the crew had woken up and &quot;Effie&quot; had turned about and was now headed due south, out of the exclusion zone at . A report from the Shackleton at 07:25 indicated that &quot;Effie&quot; was now sailing in company with &quot;Cossack&quot;.

By this time the Valiants had started their engines; they took off at 07:35, and were on the way when &quot;Cossack&quot; reported that &quot;Effie&quot; had cleared the area. The bomb was dropped from Valiant XD824, piloted by Millett, at 08:47 on 8 November 1957; Flight Lieutenant R. Bates flew the grandstand Valiant XD825. This time the yield of exceeded expectations; the predicted yield had only been , but it was still below the safety limit. This was the real hydrogen bomb Britain wanted, but it used a relatively large quantity of expensive highly enriched uranium. Due to the higher-than-expected yield of the explosion, there was some damage to buildings, the fuel storage tanks, and helicopters on the island.

===&quot;Grapple Y&quot; (1 test)===
The physicists at Aldermaston had plenty of ideas about how to follow up Grapple X, and the possibilities were discussed in September 1957. One was to adjust the width of the shells in the Dick to find an optimal configuration. If they were too thick, they would slow the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction; if they were too thin, they would give rise to Rayleigh–Taylor instability. Another was to do away with the shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had an idea, which Samuel Curran supported, of a three-layer Dick that used a greater amount of lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7) while reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the centre of the core. This proposal was adopted in October, and it became known as &quot;Dickens&quot; because it used Ken&#x27;s Dick. The device would otherwise be similar to Round A, but with a larger radiation case. The safety limit was again set to . Keith Roberts calculated that the yield could reach , and suggested that this could be reduced by modifying the tamper, but Cook opposed this, fearing that it might cause the test to fail. The possibility of a moratorium on testing caused the plans for the test, codenamed Grapple Y, to be restricted to the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, who gave informal approval, and a handful of officials.
The New Zealand National Party lost the 1957 election, and Walter Nash became prime minister. His New Zealand Labour Party had endorsed a call by the British Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing, but he felt obligated to honour commitments made by his predecessors to support the British nuclear testing programme. However, HMNZS &quot;Rotoiti&quot; was unavailable, as it was joining the Far East Strategic Reserve; its place would be taken by the destroyer . Air Vice Marshal John Grandy succeeded Oulton as Task Force commander, and Air Commodore Jack Roulston became the Air Task Force Commander.

The bomb was dropped off Christmas Island at 10:05 local time on 28 April 1958 by a Valiant piloted by Squadron Leader Bob Bates. It had an explosive yield of about , and remains the largest British nuclear weapon ever tested. The design of Grapple Y was notably successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear reaction instead of fission of a heavy uranium-238 tamper, making it a true hydrogen bomb, and because its yield had been closely predicted—indicating that its designers understood what they were doing.

===&quot;Grapple Z&quot; series (4 tests)===
On 22 August 1958, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom also agreed to suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible to allow them to design production nuclear weapons. As the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that the quality and quantity of what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be the biggest and most complex British test series.
Of particular concern was radiation damage. Keith Roberts and Bryan Taylor at Aldermaston had discovered that the flash of radiation from the detonation of an atomic bomb could affect a nearby bomb. This opened up the possibility of a missile warhead being disabled by another launched for this purpose. Plutonium cores were especially vulnerable, as they were already prone to predetonation. This had the potential to render Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrent ineffective. This discovery was given the highest level of secrecy, and Aldermaston would spend much of the next few years working on the problem. To build a primary immune to this effect would require techniques that Aldermaston had not yet mastered. The number of tests in the series was assumed to be four for planning purposes, but as late as May the Prime Minister had only approved two tests, tentatively scheduled for 15 August and 1 September 1958. Four Valiants, XD818, XD822, XD824 and XD827, deployed to Christmas Island, the last of which arrived on 31 July.

The first test was of Pendant, a fission bomb boosted with solid lithium hydride intended as a primary for a thermonuclear bomb. Rather than being dropped from a bomber, this bomb was suspended from a string of four vertically stacked barrage balloons. This was chosen over an air drop because the bomb assembly could not be fitted into a droppable casing, but it introduced a host of problems. A balloon test had been tried only once before by the British, during Operation Antler at Maralinga in October 1957. William Saxby from Aldermaston was placed in charge of the balloon crews, who commenced training at RAF Cardington in Bedfordshire in January 1958. Inflating the balloons required 1,200 cylinders of hydrogen gas, and there were no reserves. If another balloon test was required, then the empty cylinders would have to be returned to the United Kingdom for refilling, and then shipped out again. An important consideration was how they could be shot down if they broke loose of their moorings with a live nuclear bomb. The cargo ship SS &quot;Tidecrest&quot; arrived at Christmas Island on 20 July, but the firing harness was lost at San Francisco International Airport on 1 August, and a replacement had to be flown out. The Pendant fissile core arrived by air on 12 August, and the weapon was assembled with its external neutron initiator unit. On 22 August 1958 it was hoisted in the air over the south east corner of Christmas Island, and it detonated at 09:00. The yield was assessed at .

The next test was of Flagpole, an scaled down version of the Grapple Y device with a small, unboosted primary known as Indigo Herald. It was air dropped by Valiant XD822, flown by Squadron Leader Bill Bailey, with XD818 flown by Flight Lieutenant Tiff O&#x27;Connor as the grandstand aircraft, on 2 September 1958. This was the first live drop of a British nuclear weapon using blind radar technique. This meant that the bomb would be dropped using radar rather than visually with the optical bombsight, a technique normally reserved for when a target is obscured by cloud or smoke. Bailey managed to place the bomb from the target. It detonated at about offshore from South East Point on Christmas Island at 08:24 with a yield of about .

The third test was of Halliard, an unusual three-stage design with two nuclear-fission components followed by a thermonuclear stage that was supposedly immune to exposure from another bomb despite its not using boosting. The Americans had indicated an interest in it. Macmillan noted in his diary:

The success of blind radar bombing in Flagpole led to Grandy deciding to use the technique again. Hubbard was less sure. The accuracy achieved in Flagpole was exceptional; in 52 practice drops with blind radar, the average error had been as opposed to with visual bombing. Thus it was only slightly more accurate, but the aircrew would be dropping a live hydrogen bomb—generally considered a dangerous thing to do—with no means of verifying that their instruments were correct. Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, the head of Bomber Command, wished O&#x27;Connor luck; his XD827 would make the drop, with Squadron Leader Tony Caillard in XD827, the grandstand aircraft. The aircraft took off at 07:15 on 11 September 1958. Once in the air, a fault developed in the ground radar transmitter. Grandy then authorised a visual drop. It was later confirmed that it was from the target. It was detonated at about offshore from South East Point on Christmas Island at 08:49 with a yield of about , very close to the predicted yield of .

The final test in the Grapple Z series was of Burgee, at 09:00 on 23 September 1958. This was another balloon-borne test detonated over the south east corner of Christmas Island. Burgee was an atomic bomb boosted with gaseous tritium created by a generator codenamed Daffodil. It had a yield of about . The Aldermaston weapon makers had now demonstrated all of the technologies that were needed to produce a megaton hydrogen bomb that weighed no more than and was immune to premature detonation caused by nearby nuclear explosions. The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain never resumed atmospheric testing.

===Summary===
==Aftermath==
===Cooperation with the United States===

The British breakthrough came in the wake of the Soviet Union&#x27;s launch of Sputnik 1, the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite, on 4 October 1957. Sputnik came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in missile and space technology at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized the opportunity to mend the relationship between the two nations that had been damaged by the 1956 Suez Crisis. At the suggestion of Harold Caccia, the British Ambassador to the United States, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge. To do this, the McMahon Act&#x27;s restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed.

British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the United States Congress&#x27;s Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958. The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed on 3 July, and was approved by Congress on 30 July. Macmillan called this &quot;the Great Prize&quot;.

The Anglo-American Special Relationship proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals; the United States was far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The British decided to adapt the American Mark 28 as a cheaper alternative to doing their own development. This Anglicised version of the Mark 28 became Red Snow. Other weapons were acquired through Project E, under which weapons in American custody were supplied for the use of the RAF and British Army.

Nuclear material was also acquired from the United States. Under the Mutual Defence Agreement 5.4 tonnes of UK produced plutonium was sent to the US in return for of tritium and 7.5 tonnes of highly enriched uranium between 1960 and 1979. This replaced production from the British uranium enrichment facility at Capenhurst in Cheshire, although much of the highly enriched uranium was not used for weapons, but as fuel for the growing UK fleet of nuclear submarines. The Royal Navy ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the UK Polaris programme and Trident nuclear programme using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.

===Operation Dominic===
In addition to the British tests during Operation Grapple, the United States used Christmas Island for nuclear testing in Operation Dominic in 1962. Twenty-four nuclear bombs were detonated near Christmas Island as part of this test series. In 1979, the Gilbert Islands, Phoenix Islands and Line Islands, which included Christmas Island and Malden Island, became independent of the United Kingdom as the Republic of Kiribati. By the 1980s, there was a permanent population of around 1,200 the majority of whom were Gilbertese. The spelling of the name of the island was changed to Kiritimati, the Gilbertese writing of Christmas. Malden Island was uninhabited, but Penrhyn Island was part of the Cook Islands, a self-governing dependency of New Zealand.

===Health effects===
In 2005, a Massey University study that was contracted and paid for by a veterans&#x27; organisation in New Zealand examined some 50 sailors who observed the tests from ships. It was found in one battery of tests, that they were indistinguishable from the control group, which is interpreted as indicating that &quot;DNA repair mechanisms in the veterans are not deficient&quot;. The same Massey University team tested for chromosome translocations within peripheral blood lymphocytes, and a statistically higher rate of this non-germline abnormality was found.

Various veterans&#x27; organisations then filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following the publication of the study, with many media outlets reporting on it at the time. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation. Some veterans of Operation Grapple believe that cancers, bone problems and genetic defects passed on to subsequent generations have been consequences of their radiation exposure.

In 1993, Ken McGinley, a veteran of five of the tests, and Edward Egan, a veteran of Grapple Y, sued for £100,000 damages (equivalent to £ in ) over multiple health problems which they attributed to their involvement in the tests. They took their claim to the European Court of Human Rights, which rejected it in a 5–4 split decision on 9 June 1998. An appeal to the court to re-open the case was declined in January 2000. A group of 1,011 British ex-servicemen were denied permission to sue the Ministry of Defence by the Supreme Court in March 2012, on the grounds that too much time had elapsed since they became aware of their medical conditions, under the terms of the Limitation Act 1980. In January 2015, the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, announced that the Fijian government would provide Fiji $9,855 compensation payments to the 24 surviving Fijian servicemen who participated in Operation Grapple. On 21 November 2022 British veterans of nuclear tests won a medal after years of campaigning.

<text>Athens is one of the oldest named cities in the world, having been continuously inhabited for perhaps 5,000 years. Situated in southern Europe, Athens became the leading city of ancient Greece in the first millennium BC, and its cultural achievements during the 5th century BC laid the foundations of Western civilization.

During the early Middle Ages, the city experienced a decline, then recovered under the later Byzantine Empire and was relatively prosperous during the period of the Crusades (12th and 13th centuries), benefiting from Italian trade. Following a period of sharp decline under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, Athens in the 19th century as the capital of the independent and self-governing Greek state.

==Name==
The name of Athens, connected to the name of its patron goddess Athena, originates from an earlier Pre-Greek language. The origin myth explaining how Athens acquired this name through the legendary contest between Poseidon and Athena was described by Herodotus, Apollodorus, Ovid, Plutarch, Pausanias and others. It even became the theme of the sculpture on the west pediment of the Parthenon. Both Athena and Poseidon requested to be patrons of the city and to give their name to it, so they competed with offering the city one gift each. Poseidon produced a spring by striking the ground with his trident, symbolizing naval power.

Athena created the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity. The Athenians, under their ruler Cecrops, accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena. (Later the Southern Italian city of Paestum was founded under the name of Poseidonia at about 600 BC.) A sacred olive tree said to be the one created by the goddess was still kept on the Acropolis at the time of Pausanias (2nd century AD). It was located by the temple of Pandrosus, next to the Parthenon. According to Herodotus, the tree had been burnt down during the Persian Wars, but a shoot sprung from the stump. The Greeks saw this as a symbol that Athena still had her mark there on the city.

Plato, in his dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot;, offers an etymology of Athena&#x27;s name connecting it to the phrase &quot;ἁ θεονόα&quot; or &quot;hē theoû nóēsis&quot; (ἡ θεοῦ νόησις, &#x27;the mind of god&#x27;).

==Geographical setting==

There is evidence that the site on which the Acropolis (&#x27;high city&#x27;) stands was first inhabited in the Neolithic period, perhaps as a defensible settlement, around the end of the fourth millennium BC or a little later. The site is a natural defensive position which commands the surrounding plains. It is located about inland from the Saronic Gulf, in the centre of the Cephisian Plain, a fertile valley surrounded by rivers. To the east lies Mount Hymettus, to the north Mount Pentelicus.
Ancient Athens, in the first millennium BC, occupied a very small area compared to the sprawling metropolis of modern Greece. The ancient walled city encompassed an area measuring about two kilometres (1.5 mi) from east to west and slightly less than that from north to south, although at its peak the ancient city had suburbs extending well beyond these walls. The Acropolis was situated just south of the centre of this walled area.

The Agora, the commercial and social centre of the city, lay about 400 m (1,300 ft) north of the Acropolis, in what is now the Monastiraki district. The hill of the Pnyx, where the Athenian Assembly met, lay at the western end of the city. The Eridanus (Ηριδανός) river flowed through the city.

One of the most important religious sites in ancient Athens was the Temple of Athena, known today as the Parthenon, which stood on top of the Acropolis, where its evocative ruins still stand. Two other major religious sites, the Temple of Hephaestus (which is still largely intact) and the Temple of Olympian Zeus or Olympeion (once the largest temple in mainland Greece but now in ruins) also lay within the city walls.

== Antiquity ==
===Origins and early history===

Athens has been inhabited from Neolithic times, possibly from the end of the fourth millennium BC, or over 5,000 years. By 1412 BC, the settlement had become an important center of the Mycenaean civilization and the Acropolis was the site of a major Mycenaean fortress whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic Cyclopean walls. On the summit of the Acropolis, below the later Erechtheion, cuttings in the rock have been identified as the location of a Mycenaean palace. Between 1250 and 1200 BC, to feed the needs of the Mycenaean settlement, a staircase was built down a cleft in the rock to reach a water supply that was protected from enemy incursions, comparable to similar works carried out at Mycenae.

Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as Mycenae and Pylos, it is unclear whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200 BC, an event traditionally attributed to a Dorian invasion (though now commonly attributed to a systems collapse, part of the Late Bronze Age collapse). The Athenians always maintained that they were &#x27;pure&#x27; Ionians with no Dorian element. However, Athens, like many other Bronze Age settlements, went into economic decline for around 150 years following this.

Iron Age burials, in the Kerameikos and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900 BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region; as were Lefkandi in Euboea and Knossos in Crete. This position may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as Thebes and Sparta.

===Founding myths===
According to legend, Athens was formerly ruled by kings, a situation which may have continued up until the 9th century BC. From later accounts, it is believed that these kings stood at the head of a land-owning aristocracy known as the Eupatridae (the &#x27;well-born&#x27;), whose instrument of government was a Council which met on the Hill of Ares, called the Areopagus and appointed the chief city officials, the archons and the polemarch (commander-in-chief). The most famous king of Athens was Theseus, a prominent figure in Greek Mythology who killed the Minotaur. A slightly different mythical version of Athens&#x27; past is given in Plato&#x27;s dialogue Timaeus. In this dialogue, a story is told about information given to Athenian leader Solon from Egyptian priests of the goddess Neith while he visited Egypt, according to which a well advanced Athenian state was established 9,000 years prior to his time that preceded Egypt&#x27;s oldest kingdom by a thousand years. The laws of that state were the most just and largely inspired the various kings of Egypt when making laws for their kingdom. This story is not supported by any scholarly evidence, as no Athenian state is known to have existed during the 10th millennium BC. In addition, no evidence exists of any possible cultural or other ties between Egypt and any part of present-day Greece at such early a date.

===Classical period===
During the 1st millennium BC, Athens succeeded in bringing the other towns of Attica under its rule. This process of &quot;synoikismos&quot;the bringing together into one homecreated the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility. By the 7th century BC, social unrest had become widespread, and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new code of law (hence the word &#x27;draconian&#x27;). When this failed, they appointed Solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (in 594 BC).

===Reform and democracy===


The reforms that Solon initiated dealt with both political and economic issues. The economic power of the &quot;Eupatridae&quot; was reduced by forbidding the enslavement of Athenian citizens as a punishment for debt (debt bondage), by breaking up large landed estates and freeing up trade and commerce, which allowed the emergence of a prosperous urban trading class. Politically, Solon divided the Athenians into four classes, based on their wealth and their ability to perform military service. The poorest class, the &quot;Thetai&quot;, (Ancient Greek &quot;Θήται&quot;) who formed the majority of the population, received political rights for the first time and were able to vote in the &quot;Ecclesia&quot; (Assembly). But only the upper classes could hold political office. The Areopagus continued to exist but its powers were reduced.

The new system laid the foundations for what eventually became Athenian democracy, but in the short-term it failed to quell class conflict and after twenty years of unrest the popular party, led by Peisistratos, seized power. Peisistratos is usually called a tyrant, but the Greek word &quot;tyrannos&quot; does not mean a cruel and despotic ruler, merely one who took power by force. Peisistratos was in fact a very popular ruler, who made Athens wealthy, powerful, and a centre of culture. He preserved the Solonian Constitution, but made sure that he and his family held all the offices of state.

Peisistratus built the first aqueduct tunnel at Athens, which most likely had its sources on the slopes of Mount Hymettos and along the Ilissos river. It supplied, among other structures, the fountain house in the southeast corner of the Agora, but it had a number of branches. In the 4th century BC it was replaced by a system of terracotta pipes in a stone-built underground channel, sometimes called the Hymettos aqueduct; many sections had round, oval or square access holes on top of about .
Pipe segments of this system are displayed at the Evangelismos and Syntagma Metro stations.

Peisistratos died in 527 BC and was succeeded by his sons Hippias and Hipparchus. They proved to be much less adept rulers and in 514 BC, Hipparchus was assassinated in a private dispute over a young man (see Harmodius and Aristogeiton). This led Hippias to establish a real dictatorship, which proved very unpopular. He was overthrown in 510 BC. A radical politician with an aristocratic background named Cleisthenes then took charge, and it was he who established democracy in Athens.

The reforms of Cleisthenes replaced the traditional four &quot;phyle&quot; (&#x27;tribes&#x27;) with ten new ones, named after legendary heroes and having no class basis; they were in fact electorates. Each &quot;phyle&quot; was in turn divided into three &quot;trittyes&quot; and each &quot;trittys&quot; had one or more demes, which became the basis of local government. The &quot;phyle&quot; each elected fifty members to the Boule, a council which governed Athens on a day-to-day basis. The Assembly was open to all citizens and was both a legislature and a supreme court, except in murder cases and religious matters, which became the only remaining functions of the Areopagus.

Most public offices were filled by lot, although the ten &quot;strategoi&quot; (generals) were elected. This system remained remarkably stable and, with a few brief interruptions, it remained in place for 170 years, until Philip II of Macedon defeated Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC.

===Classical Athens===
====Early Athenian military history and Persian era====
Prior to the rise of Athens, Sparta considered itself to be the leader (or 2) of the Greeks. In 499 BC, Athens sent troops to aid the Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor, who were rebelling against the Persian Empire (the Ionian Revolt). This provoked two Persian invasions of Greece by the Achaemenid Empire. In 490 BC, the Athenians, led by the soldier-statesman Miltiades, defeated the first invasion of the Persians under Darius I at the Battle of Marathon.

In 480 BC, the Persians returned under Darius&#x27;s son Xerxes. When a small Greek force holding the pass of Thermopylae was defeated, the Persians proceeded to capture an evacuated Athens. The city of Athens was twice captured and sacked by the Persians within one year after Thermopylae. Subsequently, the Athenians (led by Themistocles), with their allies, engaged the much larger Persian navy at sea in the Battle of Salamis and routed the Persians, a great turning point in the war.

In 479 BC, the Athenians and Spartans, with their allies, defeated the Persian army conclusively at the Battle of Plataea. Athens then took the war to Asia Minor. These victories enabled it to bring most of the Aegean and many other parts of Greece together in the Delian League, an Athenian-dominated alliance.

====Peloponnesian War====
The resentment felt by other cities at the hegemony of Athens led to the Peloponnesian War, which began in 431 BC and pitted Athens and its increasingly rebellious overseas empire against a coalition of land-based states led by Sparta. The conflict was a drawn out one that saw Sparta control the land while Athens was dominant at sea, however the disastrous Sicilian Expedition severely weakened Athens and the war eventually ended in an Athenian defeat following the Battle of Aegospotami which ended Athenian naval supremacy.

====Athenian coup of 411 BC====

Due to its poor handling of the war, the democracy in Athens was briefly overthrown by a coup in 411 BC; however, it was quickly restored. The Peloponnesian War ended in 404 BC with the complete defeat of Athens. Since the loss of the war was largely blamed on democratic politicians such as Cleon and Cleophon, there was a brief reaction against democracy, aided by the Spartan army (the rule of the Thirty Tyrants). In 403 BC, however, democracy was restored by Thrasybulus and an amnesty was declared.

====Corinthian War and the Second Athenian League====
Sparta&#x27;s former allies soon turned against her, due to her imperialist policy, and soon Athens&#x27; former enemies Thebes and Corinth had become her allies; they fought with Athens and Argos against Sparta in the indecisive Corinthian War (395 – 387 BC). Opposition to Sparta enabled Athens to establish a Second Athenian League.

Finally Thebes defeated Sparta in 371 BC in the Battle of Leuctra. But then the Greek cities (including Athens and Sparta) turned against Thebes, whose dominance was stopped at the Battle of Mantinea (362 BC) with the death of its military-genius leader Epaminondas.

====Athens and the rise of Macedon====
By the mid-4th century BC, however, the northern Greek kingdom of Macedon was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), Philip II&#x27;s armies defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes, forcing them into a confederation and effectively limiting Athenian independence. Philippides of Paiania, one of the wealthiest Athenian aristocratic oligarchs, campaigned for Philip II during the Battle of Chaeronea and proposed in the Assembly decrees honoring Alexander the Great for the Macedonian victory. Philippides was prosecuted in trial by Hypereides, who detested his pro-Macedonian sympathies. Subsequently, the conquests of Alexander the Great widened Greek horizons and made the traditional Greek city state obsolete. Athens remained a wealthy city with a brilliant cultural life, but ceased to be a leading power. The period following the death of Alexander in 323 BC is known as Hellenistic Greece.

====Artists and philosophers====

The period from the end of the Persian Wars to the Macedonian conquest marked the zenith of Athens as a center of literature, philosophy, and the arts. In Athens at this time, the political satire of the Comic poets at the theatres had a remarkable influence on public opinion.

Some of the most important figures of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period: the dramatists Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes, the physician Hippocrates, the philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, the historians Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon, the poet Simonides, the orators Antiphon, Isocrates, Aeschines, and Demosthenes, and the sculptor Phidias. The leading statesman of the mid-fifth century BC was Pericles, who used the tribute paid by the members of the Delian League to build the Parthenon and other great monuments of classical Athens. The city became, in Pericles&#x27;s words, &quot;the school of Hellas [Greece].&quot;

=== Hellenistic Athens ===

Shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, Antipater and Craterus became joint generals of Greece and Macedonia. Athens joined Aetolia and Thessaly in facing their power, known as the Lamian War. Craterus fell in a battle against Eumenes in 320 BC, leaving Antipater alone to rule for a year, until his death in 319 BC. Athens had a central role in the struggle for his succession, when Antipater&#x27;s son, Cassander, secured the Piraeus leaving Athens without a source of supplies, to contest Antipater&#x27;s successor, Polyperchon. To consolidate power against Cassander, Polyperchon restored Athens&#x27;s democracy, as it was before the Lamian War. However, after losing the fleet one year prior, Polyperchon had to flee Macedon when in 316 BC Cassander secured control of Athens. Cassander appointed Demetrius of Phalerum as head of the administration of Athens. Demetrius remained in power until 307 BC when Cassander&#x27;s enemy, Demetrius Poliorcetes captured Athens, and Macedon, ending the short-lived Antipatrid dynasty and installing his own. 

==== Athens and the rise of the Roman empire ====
After the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) Rome asserted its hegemony over Magna Graecia and became increasingly involved in Greece and the Balkans peninsula. The First Macedonian War (214–205 BC) between the Roman Republic and the Kingdom of Macedon ended with the Treaty of Phoenice. During the Second Macedonian War (200–197), the Romans declared &quot;the freedom of Greece&quot; from the Macedonian Kings. The Roman–Seleucid War (192–188) ended with the Peace of Apamea, and the Third Macedonian War (171–168), after which Macedonian territory was divided into four client republics and Macedonia was formally annexed to the Roman Republic after the Fourth Macedonian War (150–148). The Achaean League was defeated and dissolved by the Romans in the Achaean War in 146. Greece was divided into the Roman provinces of Macedonia and Achaea; thus, Athens came under Roman rule.

===Roman Athens===

During the First Mithridatic War, Athens was ruled by Aristion, a tyrant installed by Mithridates the Great. In 88–85 BC, most Athenian fortifications and homes were leveled by the Roman general Sulla after the Siege of Athens and Piraeus, although many civic buildings and monuments were left intact. The Macedonian astronomer Andronicus of Cyrrhus subsequently designed the Tower of the Winds for the Roman forum, which mostly survives to the present day. Under Roman rule, Athens was given the status of a free city because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor Hadrian (), constructed the Library of Hadrian, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge, and finally completed the Temple of Olympian Zeus. The Arch of Hadrian commemorates the foundation of the city by Hadrian, with the &quot;city of Theseus&quot; referred to on its inscription on one side of the arch, and the new quarter erected by Hadrian around the Temple of Zeus called the &quot;city of Hadrian&quot;.
The city was sacked by the Heruli in 267 AD, resulting in the burning of all the public buildings, the plundering of the lower city and the damaging of the Agora and Acropolis. After the Sack of Athens, the city to the north of the Acropolis was hastily refortified on a smaller scale, with the agora left outside the walls. Athens remained a centre of learning and philosophy during its 500 years of Roman rule, patronized by emperors such as Nero and Hadrian.

== Late Antiquity ==

In the early 4th century AD, the eastern Roman empire began to be governed from Constantinople, and with the construction and expansion of the imperial city, many of Athens&#x27;s works of art were taken by the emperors to adorn it. The Empire became Christianized, and the use of Latin declined in favour of exclusive use of Greek; in the Roman imperial period, both languages had been used. In the later Roman period, Athens was ruled by the emperors continuing until the 13th century, its citizens identifying themselves as citizens of the Roman Empire (&quot;Rhomaioi&quot;). The conversion of the empire from paganism to Christianity greatly affected Athens, resulting in reduced reverence for the city. Ancient monuments such as the Parthenon, Erechtheion and the Hephaisteion (Theseion) were converted into churches. As the empire became increasingly anti-pagan, Athens became a provincial town and experienced fluctuating fortunes.

The city remained an important center of learning, especially of Neoplatonism—with notable pupils including Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil of Caesarea and emperor Julian ()—and consequently a center of paganism. Christian items do not appear in the archaeological record until the early 5th century. The sack of the city by the Herules in 267 and by the Visigoths under their king Alaric I () in 396, however, dealt a heavy blow to the city&#x27;s fabric and fortunes, and Athens was henceforth confined to a small fortified area that embraced a fraction of the ancient city. The emperor Justinian I () banned the teaching of philosophy by pagans in 529, an event whose impact on the city is much debated, but is generally taken to mark the end of the ancient history of Athens. Athens was sacked by the Slavs in 582, but remained in imperial hands thereafter, as highlighted by the visit of the emperor Constans II () in 662/3 and its inclusion in the Theme of Hellas.

== Middle Ages ==

=== Byzantine Athens ===
The city was threatened by Saracen raids in the 8th–9th centuries—in 896, Athens was raided and possibly occupied for a short period, an event which left some archaeological remains and elements of Arabic ornamentation in contemporary buildings—but there is also evidence of a mosque existing in the city at the time. In the great dispute over Byzantine Iconoclasm, Athens is commonly held to have supported the iconophile position, chiefly due to the role played by Empress Irene of Athens in the ending of the first period of Iconoclasm at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. A few years later, another Athenian, Theophano, became empress as the wife of Staurakios (r. 811–812).

Invasion of the empire by the Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and the ensuing civil wars, largely passed the region by and Athens continued its provincial existence unharmed. When the Byzantine Empire was rescued by the resolute leadership of the three Komnenos emperors Alexios, John and Manuel, Attica and the rest of Greece prospered. Archaeological evidence tells us that the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.

The agora or marketplace, which had been deserted since late antiquity, began to be built over, and soon the town became an important centre for the production of soaps and dyes. The growth of the town attracted the Venetians, and various other traders who frequented the ports of the Aegean, to Athens. This interest in trade appears to have further increased the economic prosperity of the town.

The 11th and 12th centuries were the Golden Age of Byzantine art in Athens. Almost all of the most important Middle Byzantine churches in and around Athens were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of the town in general. However, this medieval prosperity was not to last. In 1204, the Fourth Crusade conquered Athens and the city was not recovered from the Latins before it was taken by the Ottoman Turks. It did not become Greek in government again until the 19th century.

===Latin Athens===

From 1204 until 1458, Athens was ruled by Latins in three separate periods, following the Crusades. The &quot;Latins&quot;, or &quot;Franks&quot;, were western Europeans and followers of the Latin Church brought to the Eastern Mediterranean during the Crusades. Along with rest of Byzantine Greece, Athens was part of the series of feudal fiefs, similar to the Crusader states established in Syria and on Cyprus after the First Crusade. This period is known as the &quot;Frankokratia&quot;.

====Burgundian period====
Athens was initially the capital of the eponymous Duchy of Athens, a fief of the Latin Empire which replaced the Byzantine Empire, ruling from Constantinople. After Thebes became a possession of the Latin dukes, which were of the Burgundian family called De la Roche, it replaced Athens as the capital and seat of government, although Athens remained the most influential ecclesiastical centre in the duchy and site of a prime fortress.

Under the Burgundian dukes, a bell tower was added to the Parthenon, known as the Frankish Tower. The Burgundians brought chivalry and tournaments to Athens; they also fortified the Acropolis. They were themselves influenced by Byzantine Greek culture.

====Aragonese period====
In 1311, Athens was conquered by the Catalan Company, a band of mercenaries called &quot;Almogavars&quot;. It was held by the Catalans until 1388. After 1379, when Thebes was lost, Athens became the capital of the duchy again.

The history of Aragonese Athens, called &quot;Cetines&quot; (rarely &quot;Athenes&quot;) by the conquerors, is obscure. Athens was a &quot;veguería&quot; with its own castellan, captain, and &quot;veguer&quot;. At some point during the Aragonese period, the Acropolis was further fortified and the Athenian archdiocese received an extra two suffragan sees.

====Florentine period====
In 1388, the Florentine Nerio I Acciajuoli took the city and made himself duke. The Florentines had to dispute the city with the Republic of Venice, but they ultimately emerged victorious after seven years of Venetian rule (1395–1402). The descendants of Nerio I Acciajuoli ruled the city (as their capital) until the Turkish conquest of 1458.

== Early modern period ==

===Ottoman Athens===
The first Ottoman attack on Athens, which involved a short-lived occupation of the town, came in 1397, under the Ottoman generals Yaqub Pasha and Timurtash. Finally, in 1458, Athens was captured by the Ottomans under the personal leadership of Sultan Mehmed II. As the Ottoman Sultan rode into the city, he was greatly struck by the beauty of its ancient monuments and issued a &quot;firman&quot; (imperial edict) forbidding their looting or destruction, on pain of death. The Parthenon was converted into the main mosque of the city.

Under Ottoman rule, Athens was denuded of any importance and its population severely declined, leaving it as a &quot;small country town&quot; (Franz Babinger). From the early 17th century, Athens came under the jurisdiction of the Kizlar Agha, the chief black eunuch of the Sultan&#x27;s harem. The city had originally been granted by Sultan Ahmed I () to Basilica, one of his favourite concubines, who hailed from the city, in response of complaints of maladministration by the local governors. After her death, Athens came under the purview of the Kizlar Agha.

The Turks began a practice of storing gunpowder and explosives in the Parthenon and Propylaea. In 1640, a lightning bolt struck the Propylaea, causing its destruction. In 1687, during the Morean War, the Acropolis was besieged by the Venetians under Francesco Morosini, and the temple of Athena Nike was dismantled by the Ottomans to fortify the Parthenon. A shot fired during the bombardment of the Acropolis caused a powder magazine in the Parthenon to explode (26 September), and the building was severely damaged, giving it largely the appearance it has today. The Venetian occupation of Athens lasted for six months, and both the Venetians and the Ottomans participated in the looting of the Parthenon. One of its western pediments was removed, causing even more damage to the structure. During the Venetian occupation, the two mosques of the city were converted into Catholic and Protestant churches, but on 9 April 1688 the Venetians abandoned Athens again to the Ottomans.

In the 18th century, the city recovered much of its prosperity. During Michel Fourmont&#x27;s visit in the city in the 1720s, he witnessed much construction going on, and by the time the Athenian teacher Ioannis Benizelos wrote an account of the city&#x27;s affairs in the 1770s, Athens was once again enjoying some prosperity, so that, according to Benizelos, it &quot;could be cited as an example to the other cities of Greece&quot;. Its Greek population possessed a considerable degree of self-government, under a council of primates composed of the leading aristocratic families, along with the city&#x27;s metropolitan bishop. The community was quite influential with the Ottoman authorities, the (governor), the (judge), the (Islamic prelate), and the garrison commander of the Acropolis—according to Benizelos, if the did not treat them well and heed their opinion, he was liable to be removed before his annual term of office was out—particularly through the influence at Constantinople of the two Athenian-born patriarchs of Jerusalem, Parthenius (1737–1766) and Ephram II (1766–1770). Taxation was also light, with only the tax payable to the Ottoman government, as well as the salt tax and a water-tax for the olive yards and gardens.

This peaceful situation was interrupted in 1752–1753, when the execution of the previous Kizlar Agha resulted in the dispatch of a new , Sari Muselimi. His abuse of power led to protests by both the Greeks and the Turks; Sari Muselimi killed some of the notables who protested, whereupon the populace burned down his residence. The fled to the Acropolis, where he was besieged by the Athenians, until the Ottoman governor of Negroponte intervened and restored order, imprisoning the metropolitan bishop and imposing a heavy fine on the Greek community. In 1759 the new , a native Muslim, destroyed one of the pillars of the Temple of Olympian Zeus to provide material for a fifth mosque for the city—an illegal act, as the temple was considered the Sultan&#x27;s property. In the next year, Athens was removed from the purview of the Kizlar Agha and transferred to the privy purse of the Sultan. Henceforth it would be leased as a , a form of tax farming where the owner bought the proceeds of the city for a fixed sum, and enjoyed them for life.
The first owner (), Ismail Agha, a local Turk from Livadeia, had been humane and popular, appointing good , so that he was nicknamed &quot;the Good&quot;. English visitors during the 1760s report a population of around 10,000 inhabitants, around four-fifths of which were Christians. The Turkish community numbered several families established in the city since the Ottoman conquest; and their relations with their Christian neighbours were friendlier than elsewhere, as they had assimilated themselves to a degree, even to the point of drinking wine. The climate was healthy, but the city relied chiefly on pasture—practiced by the Arvanites of Attica—rather than agriculture. It exported leather, soap, grain, oil, honey, wax, resin, a little silk, cheese, and valonia, chiefly to Constantinople and France. The city hosted a French and an English consul. During the Orlov Revolt of 1770 the Athenians, with the exception of the younger men, remained cautious and passive, even when the Greek rebel chieftain Mitromaras seized Salamis. Nevertheless, it was only thanks to the intervention of Ismail Agha that the city was spared a massacre as reprisals, and was forced to pay an indemnity instead.

Ismail Agha&#x27;s successor, Hadji Ali Haseki was cruel and tyrannical, and the twenty years of his on-and-off rule over the city represented one of the worst periods in the city&#x27;s history. Supported by the city&#x27;s aristocratic families, and his relationship with the Sultan&#x27;s sister, who was his lover, he extorted large sums from the populace, and seized much property from them. Through protests in Constantinople, the Athenians achieved his recall several times, but Haseki always returned, until his final downfall and execution in 1795. Haseki&#x27;s early tenure also saw two large Muslim Albanian raids into Attica, as a response to which he ordered the construction of a new city wall, the &quot;Wall of Haseki&quot;, which was partly constructed with material taken from ancient monuments. Between 1801 and 1805 Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, arranged for the removal of many sculptures from the Parthenon (the Elgin marbles). Along with the Panathenaic frieze, one of the six caryatids of the Erechtheion was extracted and replaced with a plaster mold. All in all, fifty pieces of sculpture were carried away, including three fragments purchased by the French.
Athens produced some notable intellectuals during this era, such as Demetrius Chalcondyles (1424–1511), who became a celebrated Renaissance teacher of Greek and of Platonic philosophy in Italy. Chalcondyles published the first printed editions of Homer (in 1488), of Isocrates (in 1493), and of the Suda lexicon (in 1499), and a Greek grammar (Erotemata).

His cousin Laonicus Chalcondyles (c. 1423–1490) was also a native of Athens, a notable scholar and Byzantine historian and one of the most valuable of the later Greek historians. He was the author of the valuable work &quot;Historiarum Demonstrationes&quot; (Demonstrations of History) and was a great admirer of the ancient writer Herodotus, encouraging the interest of contemporary Italian humanists in that ancient historian. In the 17th century, Athenian-born Leonardos Philaras (c. 1595–1673), was a Greek scholar, politician, diplomat, advisor and the Duke of Parma&#x27;s ambassador to the French court, spending much of his career trying to persuade western European intellectuals to support Greek independence.

===Independence from the Ottomans===
In 1822, a Greek insurgency captured the city, but it fell to the Ottomans again in 1826 (though Acropolis held till June 1827). Again the ancient monuments suffered badly. The Ottoman forces remained in possession until March 1833, when they withdrew. At that time, the city (as throughout the Ottoman period) had a small population of an estimated 400 houses, mostly located around the Acropolis in the Plaka.

==Modern history==
In 1832, Otto, Prince of Bavaria, was proclaimed King of Greece. He adopted the Greek spelling of his name, King Othon, as well as Greek national dress, and made it one of his first tasks as king to conduct a detailed archaeological and topographical survey of Athens, his new capital. He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to complete this task. At that time, Athens had a population of only 4,000 to 5,000, residing in a scattering of houses at the foot of the Acropolis, located in what today covers the district of Plaka.

Athens was chosen as the Greek capital for historical and sentimental reasons. There are few buildings dating from the period of the Byzantine Empire or the 18th century. Once the capital was established, a modern city plan was laid out and public buildings were erected.

The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building; 1843), the Old Parliament Building (1858), the City Hall (1874), the Zappeion Exhibition Hall (1878), the Greek National Academy (1885) and the New Royal Palace (now the Presidential Palace; 1897). Athens hosted the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first in modern times.

Athens experienced its second period of explosive growth following the disastrous Greco-Turkish War in 1921, when more than a million Greek refugees from Asia Minor were resettled in Greece, after the Asia Minor Catastrophe in 1922. Suburbs such as Nea Ionia and Nea Smyrni began as refugee settlements on the Athens outskirts and the population of the city doubled.


=== Athens during World War II ===
Athens was occupied by the Axis (primarily German soldiers) during World War II and experienced terrible privations during the later years of the war. The Great Famine greatly affected the city during the occupation. Several resistance organizations were present inside Athens to fight against the occupation. Following the liberation of Greece and the ensuing Greek Civil War, the Dekemvriana rocked the city with heavy fighting between communist forces and government forces backed by the British.

=== Contemporary Athens ===

Following World War II the city began to grow again as people migrated from the villages and islands to find work. Greek entry into the European Union in 1981 brought a flood of new investment to the city, but also increasing social and environmental problems. Athens had some of the worst traffic congestion and air pollution in the world at that time. This posed a new threat to the ancient monuments of Athens, as traffic vibration weakened foundations and air pollution corroded marble. The city&#x27;s environmental and infrastructure problems were the main reason why Athens failed to secure the 1996 Centenary Olympic Games. Following the failed attempt to secure the 1996 Olympics, both the city of Athens and the Greek government, aided by European Union funds, undertook major infrastructure projects such as the new Athens Airport and a new metro system. The city also tackled air pollution by restricting the use of cars in the center of the city. As a result, Athens won its bid to host the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. Despite the skepticism of many observers, the games were a success and brought renewed prestige and tourism revenue to Athens. The 2008 Greek Riots began in Athens following the killing of a 15-year old student by an officer.
As of May 2024, construction of a new metro line in Athens, Line 4, is underway, meaning the biggest infrastructure project in Greece at present. The new line will include 15 stations on a U-shaped underground route of 13 kilometers of tunnels, located mostly in central Athens. The project is expected to be completed in 2029.

<text>often refers to castles or fortresses in the Ryukyu Islands that feature stone walls. However, the origin and essence of &quot;gusuku&quot; remain controversial. In the archaeology of Okinawa Prefecture, the &quot;Gusuku period&quot; refers to an archaeological epoch of the Okinawa Islands that follows the shell-mound period and precedes the Sanzan period, when most &quot;gusuku&quot; are thought to have been built. Many &quot;gusuku&quot; and related cultural remains on Okinawa Island have been listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites under the title &quot;Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu&quot;.

The &quot;Yarazamori Gusuku Inscription&quot; (1554) contains phrases, &quot;pile &quot;gusuku&quot;&quot; (くすくつませ) and &quot;pile up &quot;gusuku&quot; and ...&quot; (くすくつみつけて); apparently, &quot;gusuku&quot; in these phrases refers to stone walls. In the &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot; (16th–17th centuries), the term &quot;gusuku&quot; is written as &quot;くすく,&quot; or &quot;ぐすく&quot; in hiragana. Occasionally, the Chinese character &quot;城&quot; (castle) is assigned to it. In later ryūka and kumi odori, the reading &quot;shiro&quot; is also used for the same Chinese character, in addition to also using 城内 (shiro-uchi; inside the castle). The references to &quot;gusuku&quot; in the &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot; are mostly about castles and fortresses, but sacred places and places of worship are called &quot;gusuku&quot; as well. In some cases, &quot;gusuku&quot; simply refers to Shuri Castle. The &quot;Liuqiu-guan yiyu&quot; (琉球館訳語), a Okinawan dictionary written in Chinese, maps Chinese &quot;皇城&quot; (imperial palace) to the transcription &quot;姑速姑&quot; (&quot;gu-su-gu&quot;). Similarly, the &quot;Yiyu yinshi&quot; (音韻字海) assigns &quot;窟宿孤&quot; (&quot;ku-su-gu&quot;) to &quot;皇城.&quot;

==Etymology==
There is no consensus about the etymology of &quot;gusuku&quot;. Chamberlain analyzed the word as the combination of &quot;gu&quot; (&lt; honorific &quot;go&quot; 御) and &quot;shuku&quot; (宿). Kanazawa Shōzaburō also segmented &quot;gusuku&quot; into &quot;gu&quot; and &quot;suku&quot; but considered that the latter half was cognate with Old Japanese &quot;shiki&quot;, in which &quot;ki&quot; was a loan from Old Korean. Iha Fuyū proposed that &quot;suku&quot; was cognate with &quot;soko&quot; (塞, fortress). Hirata Tsugumasa considered that &quot;suku&quot; was cognate with Japanese &quot;soko&quot; (底, bottom). Similarly, Higashionna Kanjun raised doubts over the analysis of &quot;gu&quot; since older records always used honorific &quot;u&quot; (&lt; &quot;o&quot;) instead of &quot;gu&quot; (&lt; &quot;go&quot;). Nakahara Zenchū identified &quot;gu&quot; as &quot;go&quot; (stone).

==Common features==
===Walls===
The most prominent feature of most gusuku is their wall(s). Gusuku walls are primarily made with Ryukyuan limestone and, sometimes, coral. There are three types of gusuku walls: &quot;aikata-zumi&quot;, &quot;nozura-zumi&quot;, and &quot;nuno-zumi&quot;. Examples of each are Nakagusuku Castle, Nakijin Castle, Zakimi Castle, and parts of Shuri Castle. The shape of gusuku walls usually follows the contours of the land. They are usually thick, and sometimes have low parapets atop them. Some gusuku walls, like those of Nakagusuku Castle, were designed to resist cannon fire.

===Bailey===
Gusuku have one or more baileys. The baileys of typical gusuku usually contained a residence, a well, an utaki, and storage buildings. Larger gusuku, like Nakijin Castle, could have more than five baileys, while smaller gusuku, like Iha Castle, had a single bailey.

===Gates===
Gusuku have one or more entrances, often guarded by a heavy gate or gatehouse. Gates were the strongpoints of gusuku. Many gusuku, like Nakijin Castle, were adapted to have gun ports next to their gates.

===Main Hall===
At the heart of most gusuku was the . The Main Hall was typically the residence of a feudal lord (Aji). The palace at Shuri Castle is the most prominent Main Hall, being the only one remaining, but the site of the Main Hall is very obvious at other gusuku, such as Katsuren Castle.

===Utaki===
Almost all gusuku contain or are near an , shrines and sites of religious importance in the Ryukyuan religion. The relationship between utaki and gusuku has led some experts to question the origin and essence of gusuku.

==Research==
===Okinawa Islands===
Although it is widely recognized within the Okinawa Islands that &quot;gusuku&quot; are castles/fortresses, there is ample reason to question this perception. The origin and essence of &quot;gusuku&quot; were actively discussed in the 1960s and 70s and remain controversial.

Cultural geographer Nakamatsu Yashū claimed that the essence of gusuku was a sacred place. His theory was backed by decades of field work that was not limited to the Okinawa Islands but that extended to Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama. He revealed that an overwhelming majority of what were called &quot;gusuku&quot; by local communities did not look like castles or fortresses at all. In fact, they were too isolated from local communities, too small to live in and lacked water supply. Among hundreds of gusuku, only a dozen were fortifications. Each community usually had a gusuku. Gusuku were typically located on hills, but some were on sand dunes, on cliff edges, and in caves. In some communities, what were called gusuku were actually stone tombs. Nakamatsu explained the great diversity of gusuku by one feature in common: sacredness. According to Nakamatsu, a gusuku was in origin a place of &quot;aerial burial.&quot; The reason that a dozen of gusuku were transformed into fortress/castle-like structures is unclear, but he conjectured that some rulers had expanded gusuku substantially by building their family residences around them. Shuri Castle, for example, encompasses sacred places such as &quot;Sui mui gusuku&quot; and &quot;Madan mui gusuku&quot;, which suggests the original nature of the castle.

Archaeologists from Okinawa Prefecture have labeled some archaeological findings as gusuku. Takemoto Masahide claimed that gusuku were defensive communities. He classified what he considered gusuku into three types:
* A: residence of political leaders, a fortress/castle with stone walls,
* B: defensive community, and
* C: place of ancestor worship or burial place.
According to Takemoto, Type B, which is overwhelming in number, appeared during the transitional period between primitive society and class society. As noted by Asato Susumu, there is a significant gap in the use of the term &quot;gusuku&quot;. While Nakamatsu referred to limited space as gusuku, Takamoto applied the term to the whole archaeological site.

Archaeologist Tōma Shiichi hypothesized that a gusuku was the residence of an aji (local ruler or warlord) and his family. Since most gusuku in the Okinawa Islands are accompanied with stone walls, he considered that the Gusuku Period was characterized by the formation of class society. Among archaeologists, however, Kokubu Naoichi supported Nakamatsu&#x27;s theory considering poor living conditions of gusuku. Asato Susumu expressed concern about the association of gusuku with class society because the emergence of political rulers was not well attested by archaeological findings but mostly based on literature that was written centuries later.

Folklorist Kojima Yoshiyuki was also a supporter of the sacredness theory. However, he opposed to Nakamatsu&#x27;s theory about the origin of gusuku as a burial place. He argued that the word &quot;gusuku&quot; originally meant stonework. Separately of this, local communities handed down mountain cult, which shared roots with that of Yakushima and by extension Japan. Some sacred mountains were later fortified with stone walls, and as a result, &quot;gusuku&quot; came to mean castles/fortresses.

In any case, a flood of archaeological discoveries in the 1970s led Okinawan archaeologists to establish archaeological periods of the Okinawa Islands that were distinct from those of Japan (Amami and the Sakishima group also have unique archaeological periods distinct from Japan and one another). In their framework, the &quot;Gusuku period&quot; is an archaeological epoch of the Okinawa Islands, which they consider was characterized by the widespread appearance of gusuku, the widespread use of iron, and farming. It follows the Shell Mound period and precedes the Sanzan period. It is parallel with the late Heian to Muromachi periods of Japan. Also, the beginning of the Gusuku period corresponds to that of the Old Ryukyu period of Okinawan historiography, both beginning in 1187 with the semi-legendary ascension of King Shunten.

Takanashi Osamu, an Amami-based archaeologist, criticized the trend of Okinawan archaeology. The Gusuku period lacked clear markers of dating from an archaeological perspective. Pottery seriation, in particular, remained poorly understood. The contemporaneousness of stone walls and excavated potteries was not established. He also noted a bias of Okinawan archaeologists, who he thought were preoccupied with questions of how the Okinawa-centered kingdom of Ryukyu was formed.

While typical castle/fortress-type gusuku in the Okinawa Islands were featured by stone walls, it was discovered in the 1980s and 90s that some fortifications in northern Okinawa Island lacked stone walls but instead were characterized by earthworks, &quot;kuruwa&quot; and dry moats. This style of fortifications is in fact rather common in Amami Ōshima and representative of medieval mountain fortifications (中世山城) of Japan. Naka Shōhachirō and Chinen Isamu, a historian and an archaeologist from Okinawa dated them to the late 12th to early 13th centuries and claimed that they were predecessors of gusuku with stone walls. This view was actively criticized by Takanashi Osamu in the late 1990s and 2000s.

===Sakishima Islands===
Archaeological studies in the Sakishima Islands in southern Okinawa Prefecture are not so active as those in the main Okinawa Islands. Some Okinawa-led archaeological reports labeled some sites in Miyako and Yaeyama as &quot;gusuku-like.&quot; Archaeologist Ono Masatoshi raised concern about the naïve application of the Okinawan gusuku-as-fortifications framework and urged that scholars should not turn a blind eye to the diversified nature of archaeological sites with stone walls in these islands. Few gusuku sites can be attributed to the fact that the Sakishima Islands were over a hundred years behind Okinawa socially and technologically. In 1500, Ryukyu invaded and annexed the islands, which would have limited further local gusuku development. The primary gusuku site in Yaeyama is Furusutobaru Castle, residence of Oyake Akahachi, which was attacked by Nakasone Toyomiya of Miyako shortly before the invasion by Ryukyu.

Linguist Nakamoto Masachie noted that in some dialects of Yaeyama, &quot;gusuku&quot;/&quot;gushiku&quot; means stone walls themselves (not a structure with stone walls) and conjectured that this might be the original meaning of &quot;gusuku&quot;. According to Ono Masatoshi, &quot;gusuku&quot; has various meanings, depending on dialects of Yaeyama, including a partition of a mansion and stone walls surrounding an agricultural field. Nakamatsu Yashū claimed that &quot;suku&quot;-like word forms were more prominent in Miyako and Yaeyama than &quot;gusuku&quot;.

Regardless of whether it is appropriate to call them &quot;gusuku&quot;, the Yaeyama Islands have archaeological remains with stone walls, such as Mashuku Village of Hateruma Island, Hanasuku and Gumaara Villages and Shinzato Villages of Taketomi Island. These villages were abandoned around the time of the conquest by the Ryukyu Kingdom. What are common to these villages are that they were located on top of cliffs, divided by inhomogeneous cell blocks and lacked roads. The whole village and each cell block were surrounded by stone walls. This type of abandoned settlement can also be found on Miyako Island but they are rather exceptional. The local people call these remains &quot;busu nu yashiki&quot; (bushi&#x27;s mansion), &quot;busu nu yaa ishigaki&quot; (bushi&#x27;s house&#x27;s stone walls) or &quot;busu nu yaa&quot; (bushi&#x27;s house), &quot;busu nu yama&quot; (bushi&#x27;s mountain) in Ishigaki, &quot;bushin yaa&quot; (bushi&#x27;s house) in Hatoma, &quot;nishi nu bushi nu yaa&quot; (bushi&#x27;s house in the north) in Aragusuku.

In the archaeology of Yaeyama, human settlements prior to the conquest by Ryukyu are called &quot;Suku Villages&quot; because the names of these ruins have the suffix &quot;-suku&quot;. By extension, the archaeological epoch of the Suku Culture (11–16th centuries) is sometimes used by archaeologists.

===Amami Islands===
Formal studies of gusuku in the Amami Islands group in southern Kagoshima Prefecture were started by Nakamatsu Yashū in the 1960s and 70s. He revealed that most of what were called gusuku by local communities of Amami were by no means fortifications. He also noted that Amami had &quot;-suku&quot; toponyms, which were otherwise considered specific to Miyako and Yaeyama. However, his study on Amami went largely unnoticed.

In the 1980s and 90s, Miki Yasushi, an expert of medieval mountain fortifications of Japan, extended his research to the Amami Islands, largely independently of Okinawan archaeology. His comprehensive study found 129 gusuku toponyms in Amami Ōshima. Similarly, a 1982 research project by Kagoshima Prefecture covered 45 fortifications in Amami. Miki carefully noted that, as Nakamatsu had shown, most of what were called gusuku were not fortifications, and that conversely, some fortifications were not called gusuku by the locals. A major difference from those in the Okinawa Islands was that gusuku in Amami (except those in Okinoerabu and Yoron) nearly completely lacked stone walls. As a historian from Japan, Miki took much notice of the religious nature of gusuku in Amami, which is completely absent from Japanese fortresses.

Publications from Amami gained attention of some Okinawan archaeologists in the 1980s and 90s, and they attempted to place Amami&#x27;s gusuku in the Okinawan gusuku-as-fortifications framework. Naka Shōhachiro investigated some gusuku in Amami Ōshima and discovered &quot;kuruwa&quot; and dry moats there. He claimed that the primary function of those gusuku was defensiveness, not religiousness as Nakamatsu claimed. He dated them to the late 12th to early 13th centuries and considered that they subsequently evolved into those with stone walls in Okinawa. By contrast, Miki conjectured that the construction of these fortifications was triggered by repeated invasion by the Ryukyu Kingdom in the 15th and 16th centuries.

In his survey of earlier studies, Takanashi Osamu criticized Naka&#x27;s theory because his dating lacked evidence. In fact, gusuku with established dates were mostly from the 14th to 16th centuries. While other archaeologists had focused on mountain fortifications, he paid attention to gusuku in flat land. He also indicated the possible presence of gusuku in the Tokara Islands, which are located to the north of Amami.

From 1995 to 2000, a comprehensive investigation of gusuku was conducted in Naze (merged into the city of Amami in 2006) of northern Amami Ōshima. This project initially relied on &quot;gusuku&quot; toponyms to find archaeological remains but discovered far more remains in the mountains than expected. Among 45 sites discovered, only five had &quot;gusuku&quot; toponyms. This suggests that these sites were not gusuku in origin and that some of them were later transformed into gusuku. The toponymic survey also found that some earlier archaeological reports had labeled gusuku even though the referents were not called &quot;gusuku&quot; by locals. As a result, so-called &quot;Uragami Gusuku&quot;, for example, was renamed to &quot;Uragami-Arimori site.&quot;

Earlier studies pointed to the similarity between gusuku in Amami, northern Okinawa Island and medieval mountain fortifications of Japan. Takanashi went further claiming that these fortifications were indeed medieval mountain fortifications. He considered the possibility that there were gaps in time among (1) the beginning of the archaeological sites, (2) the construction of defensive structures and (3) the applications of the name of gusuku. He re-evaluated Nakamatsu&#x27;s sacredness theory and presented a working hypothesis that gusuku in Amami were of secondary origin, possibly related to the introduction of the &quot;noro&quot; priestess system by the Ryukyu Kingdom.

<doc id="441654" wikidata="Q5507167" url="?curid=441654" title="Fuel protests in the United Kingdom">
<text>The fuel protests in the United Kingdom were a series of campaigns held in response to the rising petrol and diesel fuel prices for road vehicle use. There have been three major campaigns amongst many other protests in the 21st century. The first major protest in 2000 was primarily led by independent lorry owner-operators. One group of lorry owner-operators from the South East of England formed a protest group called &quot;TransAction&quot; that protested at oil refineries and fuel depots in Essex. Protests and blockades of oil facilities caused widespread disruption to the supply of petroleum products. The aim of the protests was to secure a reduction in the fuel duty rate on petrol and diesel, which the government refused to enact. After the protest ended, the government did announce a freeze on fuel duties, and promised changes would be made to the way that goods vehicles were taxed, which would include the taxing of foreign vehicles operating on British roads.

Subsequent protests have not had as significant an impact but did result in panic buying in 2005, and again in 2007.

Further protests took place in the United Kingdom in 2022 as a result of record high fuel prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Background==
In the United Kingdom, tax on fuel for road use is made up of two elements—fuel duty and value added tax (VAT). Fuel duty is applied at a fixed amount per litre by fuel type, and VAT is then added as a percentage of the combined total of the cost of the fuel and the fuel duty. Historically, fuel duty was increased annually, broadly in line with inflation. In 1993, the fuel price escalator was introduced by the Conservatives, justified as being designed to encourage less motor vehicle use, and thus combat climate change. The idea was to annually increase fuel duty, initially at 3%, later rising to 5%, above the rate of inflation. The Blair government then increased the rate at which the escalator exceeded inflation to 6%.

==2000==
By 2000, tax accounted for 81.5% of the total cost of unleaded petrol, up from 72.8% in 1993. Fuel prices in the UK had risen from being amongst the cheapest in Europe to being the most expensive in the same time frame. The protesters said that higher transport costs in the UK were making it difficult for haulage industry to remain competitive. The worldwide price of oil had increased from $10 to $30 a barrel, the highest level in 10 years. Drivers in the UK were now paying an average of 80 pence a litre for unleaded and 80.8p for diesel. The government had already abandoned the fuel tax escalator in early 2000.

===Timeline and effects===

In 1999, lorry drivers had undertaken protests in London against rising fuel prices and announced their intentions for a nationwide campaign. The Conservative Party organised a day of protest on 29 July 2000 to draw attention to how fuel prices had increased under Labour, visiting town centres with petitions and distributing leaflets. The Boycott the Pumps campaign, also referred to as Dump the Pumps, was organised for 1 August 2000, with motorists being urged not to visit petrol stations on that day. Support for the day was reported to be patchy, with forecourts in the North-West being hit the hardest, some reporting a 50% drop in business.

On 8 September 2000, the Stanlow Refinery near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire was blockaded by Farmers for Action, led by David Handley. Over the next few days, pickets were reported at Milford Haven and an oil terminal at Avonmouth causing some petrol stations to run out of supplies. On 8 September 2000, fuel protesters blockaded several facilities for a limited period and disrupted fuel supplies to Yorkshire, North West England, and the Scottish Borders demanding that the government reduce fuel taxes. Some of the protesters called for a reduction of between 15 and 26 pence per litre in duties.

The protests spread so that on 10 September 2000 they included facilities at the Manchester Fuels Terminal, Kingsbury Oil Terminal, the largest inland oil terminal, and at Cardiff Docks. Panic buying of petrol began to close some petrol stations as motorists queued for fuel which was beginning to be rationed and reports of garages increasing their prices substantially. Rolling roadblocks were also reported in North East England on the A1 and A55 roads. On 11 September 2000, the government obtained an Order in Council which was authorised by the Privy Council and the Queen to take emergency powers under the Energy Act 1976 to ensure delivery of fuel to essential services. By now six of the nine refineries and four oil distribution depots were subject to protests.
By Tuesday 12 September 2000, 3,000 petrol stations were reported to be closed due to a lack of fuel. There were also reports that there would be no fuel left within 48 hours. Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, put the oil companies under pressure to resume deliveries. BP said that they would resume deliveries if police escorts were given to the tankers. Tony Blair had been in contact with the oil companies during the day and announced that supplies would be on the way back to normal within 24 hours, with the oil companies having been ordered under the government&#x27;s powers to commence deliveries to the emergency services. At the same time BBC News reported that the government&#x27;s COBRA committee had drawn up plans to deal with the crisis, including using the military to assist in moving supplies and restricting the sale of fuel. South West Trains were reported to be reducing some of their services to preserve fuel supplies. Deliberately slow-moving convoys of lorries caused traffic jams on the M1 and M5 motorways.
On 13 September 2000 the government announced that 5% of normal fuel deliveries were made, however other reports indicated that only 3.8% amounting to compared with a normal daily sale of . In Scotland only very limited supplies were being delivered for emergency use only. Three-quarters of petrol stations were reported to be without fuel. Some NHS trusts cancelled non-essential operations due to staff difficulties in reaching work and ambulances were only able to answer emergency calls in most parts of the UK. The National Blood Service reported that it was coping and blood supplies to hospitals were not under threat but said that there &quot;were some significant problems in some parts of the country&quot;. The government placed the National Health Service (NHS) on red alert. Supermarkets began rationing food due to difficulties in getting food deliveries through and there were reports of panic buying. Sainsbury&#x27;s warned that they would run out of food within days having seen a 50% increase in their sales over the previous two days; Tesco and Safeway stated that they were rationing some items. The Royal Mail also reported they didn&#x27;t have enough fuel supplies to maintain deliveries and that schools began to close. The government began deploying military tankers around the country and designated 2,000 petrol stations to receive supplies for essential services. Some deliveries commenced from the refineries and the police supplied escorts as required to ensure that tankers could move.

On 14 September 2000, the protests began to end. Several blockades of refineries were still in operation and the first deliveries were sent to designated distribution points under the emergency powers obtained by the government. Bus companies had warned that diesel stocks were running out and that services would need to be restricted to extend supplies. The protesters said that they were giving the government sixty days to act on the issue or they would protest further. A planned protest by lorry drivers in London was contained by the Metropolitan Police and did not cause disruption. A later report following an analysis of the automated counting equipment on the road network the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions showed that at the protest&#x27;s peak, 14 September, car flows on UK motorways was 39% below normal levels and on major roads 25% below. However, for road haulage the numbers showed a smaller decline of 13% on both motorways and major roads.

By 16 September 2000, supplies were beginning to be restored, at first only to the government designated petrol stations, the number of which had risen to 3,300. The London Chamber of Commerce reported that the protests cost businesses £250 million a day. After the protests had ended the Institute of Directors estimated the cost to UK businesses at £1billion. Meanwhile, similar protests began in France, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Greece.

The conditions which catalysed and sustained the fuel protests of 2000 can be understood in terms of social movement theory, for example the existence of pre-existing social networks, capacity and resources.

===Reaction===
During the protests the oil companies were accused of collusion with the protesters by members of the government and its advisors. It was reported that the police had kept the roads clear yet tankers were being kept in the depots and not delivering petrol. The Transport and General Workers Union said that there had been incidents of intimidation against drivers of the fuel tankers. The possibility of court injunctions against the protesters was explored by TotalElfFina who received legal advice that it would be difficult to obtain and enforce one as there was not a named individual on which to serve the injunction. The company also stated that even if roads were clear, delivering fuel might change the mood of the protesters which had been &quot;amicable&quot; and that &quot;Getting fuel to the pumps would only solve the short-term problem and not deal with the original concerns of protesters&quot;. The TGWU subsequently called for a public inquiry into reports of collusion between the demonstrators and the oil companies, saying that they had evidence of protestors being allowed access to the oil companies&#x27; sites without security checks and that drivers who had been willing to deliver fuel being told not to.
The government stated that they would not back down in the face of protests or introduce an emergency budget. The government argued that the rise in prices was due to increases in the world oil market prices and not the government&#x27;s fuel duty. Whilst agreeing that the government could not make policy in response to the blockades, William Hague, Leader of the Opposition criticised the government for having increased taxes, whilst the Liberal Democrats argued that the government should have responded to the protest much earlier. The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union called for a reduction in fuel duties during the action.

A BBC opinion poll conducted by ICM of 514 people by telephone showed that the public support on 12 September 2000 for the protesters stood at 78% until the possibility of essential services being affected when it fell to 36%. An opinion poll for the Daily Mail of 502 people showed that over three-quarters thought the government had handled the crisis badly. Two opinion polls shortly after the protests had ended showed the Conservative Party had overtaken or reached equal standing with the governing Labour Party. By November support for the renewal of protests and the revival of the Conservative&#x27;s fortunes had both been reduced, with Labour retaking a poll lead.

===Consequences===
In his pre-Budget report of 8 November 2000, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced numerous changes which could ease the tax burden for motorists, and which included the taxing of foreign lorries using British roads. These changes included a cut in duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol, a freeze on fuel duty for other grades of fuel until at least April 2002 (effectively ending the fuel duty escalator), placing more vehicles into the lower vehicle excise duty (VED) band, an average cut of more than 50% on VED for lorries, and a &quot;Brit Disc&quot; vignette scheme requiring all lorries, including those from overseas, to pay tax to use British roads. The fuel duty freeze has been estimated to have cost the Treasury £2billion pounds annually in a 2004 report by the Economic and Social Research Council.

A renewed protest that same month, involving a convoy from North East England to London, did not produce the same level of support or disruption as before. It ended with a protest in Hyde Park and the closure of the Westway by vehicles left parked on it. A similar protest from John O&#x27;Groats to Edinburgh resulted in around 80 vehicles congregating in the centre of the Scottish capital. There had been some panic buying of petrol due to this protest and there were temporary closures of some petrol stations.

Brynle Williams who was one of the organisers of the protests later became a member of the Welsh Assembly for the Conservative party.

==2005==
In August 2005, petrol increased in price to record highs of over 90 pence, with a small number of stations charging over £1 a litre. In September the average price had reached 94.6p a litre, with the rise being partially blamed on decreased world supply after Hurricane Katrina caused damage to some oil facilities in the United States of America.

The BBC reported on 7 September 2005 that the group responsible for the blockades in September 2000 was threatening to stage protests at oil refineries from 0600 BST on 14 September 2005 unless reductions in fuel duty were made. Newspapers reported that on 10 September 2005, the government had drawn up contingency plans to maintain the supply of fuel, including using 1000 army drivers to operate tankers, introducing fuel rationing and confiscating the driving licences of those who broke the law. Panic buying was reported on 13 September 2005 as drivers stocked up on fuel with drivers reported to be waiting an hour to fill their vehicles with petrol. At its height, around 3,000 petrol stations were emptied of fuel.

However, on 14 September 2005, only a small number of protesters arrived at the refineries with no intention to start blockading the entrances. The UK Petroleum Industry Association said the day&#x27;s protest had proved &quot;thankfully amazingly quiet&quot;, with the largest event attended by People&#x27;s Fuel Lobby leader Andrew Spence, attracting just 10 protesters at its peak. At the Stanlow Refinery, which was blockaded in 2000 only two protesters attended the demonstration. Further protests on 16 September 2005 occurred on the M4 motorway where lorries drove as slow as .

In responding to the protests, the government argued that lower than needed supplies by OPEC and the Katrina hurricane had a more significant impact on the price of fuel than the level of duty.

==2007==

Towards the end of 2007, fuel prices exceeded £1 per litre with a 2 pence rise in fuel tax in October, resulting in the highest diesel prices and the fourth highest for petrol in Europe. New protests were planned by two unconnected groups, one called &quot;Transaction 2007&quot; and the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The Scottish branch of the RHA proposed a rolling roadblock by around 30 vehicles, whereas Transaction 2007 intended to protest outside oil refineries. Whilst the rolling road block attracted 45 vehicles driving at around on several motorways, the level of protest at oil refineries was lower than in 2000. One of the campaign aims of the RHA was the introduction of a fuel price regulator who would control duty during periods which was supported by Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland.

The protests of this period were not widely supported nor did they cause the same disruption as those in previous years. The 2007 protest which took place at the latter end of the year, culminated in 200–300 lorries descending on Central London with the police closing off the A40 fly-over for use as a lorry park for the day. Following this, a rally was held at Marble Arch. Later in the day, a deputation went to 10 Downing Street to deliver a formal petition calling for the reduction of UK fuel duty. There were those who felt that the 2007 fuel protests were politically motivated, given that many lorry owner operators and farmers would have supported the Conservative Party. The Conservative leader David Cameron gave them his support and promised a &quot;fair fuel stabiliser&quot;, a proposal to limit the price of petrol that was part of the Conservative manifesto for the 2010 UK general election and was announced to be implemented following the budget of March 2011. The &quot;fair fuel stabiliser&quot; which was meant to lower taxes levied on fuel as the price rose and raise tax as the price fell, in fact tax will still rise as the oil price rises but the tax will be capped at the level of inflation at that time and will be applied twice a year, but when the oil price is falling then the tax can be greater than inflation. Quote from &quot;Overview of Tax Legislation and Rates&quot; section 3.44: &quot;When oil prices are high, as now, fuel duty will increase by the retail prices index (RPI). However, if the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis, the Government will increase fuel duty by RPI plus 1 penny per litre. The Government believes that a trigger price of $75 per barrel would be appropriate, and will set a final trigger price and mechanism after seeking the views of oil and gas companies and motoring groups&quot;.

==2022==

As a result of the war in Ukraine pushing the global barrel price of oil to record highs, fuel prices soared. This resulted in the highest-ever fuel prices recorded in the UK. In early-July 2022, the average price for a litre of diesel reached 199.09p, while the average unleaded price was 191.55p per litre. Many petrol stations, particularly in rural areas and on motorways, were charging in excess of £2 per litre for both fuels. Protests were planned for 4 July via social media in numerous locations around the country. These demonstrations aimed to push the Government towards cutting fuel duty paid on fuel to lower the pump prices.

Support for these protests was mixed, with many happy to see action finally being taken against rising fuel costs. Others deem that this action will be largely ignored and instead cause motorists to buy more fuel due to the traffic that has been caused.

Gwent Police had arrested 12 people in connection to protests along the M4. They said there had been a legal notice in place banning demonstrators from driving below 30mph. &quot;The moving protest started at around 7.00am this morning, at 8.30am four people were arrested with another eight people arrested at around 10.45am,&quot; their statement said. Furthermore, &quot;All twelve people were arrested for breaching the legal notice by driving at under 30 mph for a prolonged amount of time.&quot; was said. Devon and Cornwall Police also released a statement saying that protests on the M5 were taken in a &quot;safe and legal manner&quot;. &quot;Officers escorted three vehicles off the road near Buckfastleigh. These drivers were given formal warnings and were advised over acceptable parameters of their protests, including a minimum speed and leaving lanes clear,&quot; said Superintendent Adrian Leisk. West Yorkshire Police had police deployed at Ferrybridge services, who deployed a stinger to stop motorists from leaving the services to take part in a protest on the M62 eastbound. They have defended the use of a stinger in this way and said that it acknowledged &quot;the importance of lawful protests but will deal swiftly with any criminal offences&quot;. &quot;It is clear deliberate disruption of the network will inconvenience huge numbers of people, draw police resources away from other important work and potentially delay the response times of all emergency services,&quot; the force tweeted.

<doc id="441659" wikidata="Q1165211" url="?curid=441659" title="Dany Chamoun">
<text>Dany Chamoun (; 26 August 1934 – 21 October 1990) was a prominent Lebanese politician. A Maronite Christian, the younger son of former President Camille Chamoun and brother of Dory Chamoun, Chamoun was also a politician in his own right. He was murdered on October 21, 1990 at age 56, along with his family.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Chamoun was born in Deir el-Qamar on 26 August 1934. He was the younger son of former Lebanese President Camille Chamoun. He studied civil engineering in the United Kingdom at Loughborough University.
===Political career===

Chamoun reported that he had not had any interest in politics before the Lebanese Civil War. He became the National Liberal Party Secretary of Defense in January 1976, after the death of his predecessor Naim Berdkan. As Supreme Commander of the NLP&#x27;s military wing, the Tigers, he also played a major role in the early years of the Lebanese Civil War.

By 1980, the Phalangist-dominated Lebanese Forces were under the command of Bachir Gemayel. The Tigers were eliminated as a military force in a surprise attack by Gemayel’s militia on 7 July 1980.

Chamoun&#x27;s life was spared, and he fled to the Sunni Muslim-dominated West Beirut. He then went into self-imposed exile.

He served as General Secretary of the National Liberal Party from 1983 to 1985, when he replaced his father as the party leader. In 1988, he became President of the revived Lebanese Front—a coalition of nationalist and mainly Christian parties and politicians that his father had helped to found. The same year, he announced his candidacy for the Presidency of Lebanon to succeed Amine Gemayel (Bashir&#x27;s brother), but Syria (which by this time occupied some 70 percent of Lebanese territory) vetoed his candidacy.

Gemayel&#x27;s term expired on 23 September 1988 without the election of a successor. Chamoun declared his strong support for Michel Aoun, who had been appointed by the outgoing president to lead an interim administration and went on to lead one of two rival governments that contended for power over the next two years. He strongly opposed the Taif Agreement, which not only gave a greater share of power to the Muslim community than they had enjoyed previously, but more seriously, in Chamoun&#x27;s opinion, formalized what he saw as the master-servant relationship between Syria and Lebanon, and refused to recognize the new government of the President Elias Hrawi, who was elected under the Taif Agreement.

===War period===
On January 18, 1976 Dany Chamoun was one of the militia commanders that participated in the Karantina Massacre, Chamoun conducted an interview after the massacre in which he denied that it was a massacre, instead referring to it as a &quot;concise military operation&quot; aimed at reclaiming private property.

On June 28, 1976 Dany Chamoun led the attack on Tal el-Zaatar palestinian camp which resulted in a significant loss of life and displacement of Palestinian refugees. Dany Chamoun and Bachir Gemayel claimed that they didn&#x27;t destroy the entire camp out of concern for the lives of civilians.

==Death==
On 21 October 1990, Chamoun, his second wife Ingrid Abdelnour (aged 45), and their two sons, Tarek (aged 7) and Julian (aged 5), were all shot dead in their apartment.

Chamoun was survived by his two daughters Tracy (through his first wife Patti Morgan ) and Tamara, eleven months old at the time of the massacre. Chamoun&#x27;s eldest daughter, Tracy had been overseas at the time of the massacre while his youngest daughter, Tamara survived.

===Aftermath and trials===
On 24 June 1995, the Lebanese Tribunal found Christian rival Samir Geagea guilty of the murder of Dany Chamoun and his family. He was sentenced to death commuted to life in prison with hard labour. Co-defendants Camille Karam and Rafic Saadeh were sentenced to ten and one year respectively. Ten other members of the Lebanese Forces were sentenced to life in absentia. The case was based entirely on circumstantial evidence and the trial was described by Amnesty International as seriously flawed. Geagea remained on trial for the Saydet al-Najat Church bombing. The verdict was rejected by a part of the Lebanese public opinion and by Dany&#x27;s brother, Dory Chamoun, who declared that the Syrian occupation army was responsible for the massacre. Geagea was released on 18 July 2005 when the 14 March Alliance-controlled Lebanese Parliament voted an amnesty bill. This is despite the amnesty bill nominally excluding the release of convicts of &quot;crimes of assassination or attempted assassination of religious figures, political leaders and foreign or Arab diplomats&quot;&quot;.

<text>Chadderton is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, Greater Manchester, England, on the River Irk and Rochdale Canal. It is located in the foothills of the Pennines, west of Oldham, south of Rochdale and north-east of Manchester.

Historically part of Lancashire, Chadderton&#x27;s early history is marked by its status as a manorial township, with its own lords, who included the Asshetons, Chethams, Radclyffes and Traffords. Chadderton in the Middle Ages was chiefly distinguished by its two mansions, Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall, and by the prestigious families who occupied them. Farming was the main industry of the area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.

Chadderton&#x27;s urbanisation and expansion coincided largely with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. A late-19th century factory-building boom transformed Chadderton from a rural township into a major mill town and the second most populous urban district in the United Kingdom. More than 50 cotton mills had been built in Chadderton by 1914.

Although Chadderton&#x27;s industries declined in the mid-20th century, the town continued to grow as a result of suburbanisation and urban renewal. The legacy of the town&#x27;s industrial past remains visible in its landscape of red-brick cotton mills, now used as warehouses or distribution centres. Some of these are listed buildings because of their architectural, historical and cultural significance.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name Chadderton derives from &quot;Caderton&quot;, which is believed to be a combination of the Brythonic word &quot;Cader&quot; or &quot;Cater&quot; (modern ), indicating a fortified place amongst the hills, or the &quot;cadeir&quot;, &quot;chair, throne&quot;, and the Old English suffix &quot;-ton&quot; meaning a settlement. The University of Nottingham&#x27;s Institute for Name-Studies has offered a similar suggestion, that the name Chadderton means &quot;farm or settlement at the hill called Cadeir&quot;. This name is believed to date from the 7th century, when Angles colonised the region following the Battle of Chester. It has been suggested that the Anglian settlers found a few Brythonic Celts already inhabiting what is now called Chadderton, and borrowed their name for the hill, &quot;Chadder&quot;, adding their own word for a settlement to the end. Archaic spellings include Chaderthon, Chaderton, Chaterton and Chatherton. The first known written record of the name Chadderton is in a legal document relating to land tenure, in about 1220.

===Early history===

The study of place names in Chadderton suggests that the ancient Britons once inhabited the area. Remains of Roman roads have been discovered running through the town, and the local road name &quot;Streetbridge&quot; suggests that the Romans once marched along it on a path which may have led to Blackstone Edge. Relics found at a tumulus in Chadderton Fold date from the Early Middle Ages, probably from the early period of Anglo-Saxon England, when Angles settled in the area and Chadderton emerged as a manor of the hundred of Salford.

Chadderton is not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Its first appearance in a written record is in a legal document from around 1220, which states that Robert, Rector of Prestwich, gave land to Richard, son of Gilbert, in exchange for an annual fee of one silver penny. Following the Norman conquest, Chadderton was made a constituent manor of the wider Royal Estate of Tottington, an extensive fee held by the Norman overlord, Roger de Montbegon. Taxation and governance continued on this basis throughout the Middle Ages, with the Barons Montbegon of Hornby Castle holding the estate, until it passed to the Barons Lacy of Clitheroe Castle, and then onto local families. In about 1235, the sub-manor of Chadderton and Foxdenton passed from Richard de Trafford of Trafford Park to Geoffrey de Trafford, who adopted the surname of Chadderton, thus founding the Chadderton family. During the High Middle Ages, pieces of land in Chadderton were granted to religious orders and institutions, including Cockersand Abbey and the Knights Hospitaller.

The manorial system was strong in Chadderton, and this lent distinction to the township, in a region which otherwise had weak local lordship. Throughout the Middle Ages, the manor of Chadderton constituted a township, centred on the hill by the banks of the River Irk, known as Chadderton Fold. The fold consisted of a cluster of cottages centred on Chadderton Hall manor house, and a water-powered corn mill. Chadderton Hall was owned and occupied by the de Chaddertons. Geoffrey de Chadderton became the Lord of the Manor of Tottington in the 13th century. The de Chaddertons&#x27; involvement in regional and national affairs gave prestige to what was otherwise an obscure and rural township. William Chaderton was Bishop of Chester from 1579 to 1595 and held distinguished academic posts such as Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity. Laurence Chaderton was the first Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and among the first translators of the King James Version of the Bible. Tottington was dissolved in the mid-15th century and there came a succession of distinguished families, each headed by an esquire with links to the monarchs of England. The Radclyffe, Assheton, and Horton families provided six High Sheriffs of Lancashire and a Governor of the Isle of Man.

Apart from the dignitaries who lived in Chadderton&#x27;s manor houses, Chadderton&#x27;s population during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, most of whom were occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl. Workers supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning and weaving of wool at home. The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the Black Death in 1646.

===Textiles and the Industrial Revolution===
Until the mid-18th century, the region in and around Chadderton was dominated by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers&#x27; cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton&#x27;s Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production to be carried out without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.

During this early period of change, Chadderton&#x27;s parliamentary representation was limited to two Members of Parliament for Lancashire. Nationally, the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and unemployment for textile workers. Nevertheless, despite years of distress and unrest, major disturbances of machine-breaking did not occur until 1826. By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political Radicalism in the region. The Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, began to organise a mass public demonstration in Manchester to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. Organised preparations took place, and a spy reported that in neighbouring Thornham, &quot;seven hundred men drilled ... as well as any army regiment would&quot;. A few days later, on 3 August, a royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling was posted in Manchester. On 16 August 1819, Chadderton (like its neighbours) sent a contingent of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration now known as the Peterloo Massacre (owing to the 15 deaths and 400–700 injuries which followed). Two of the 15 deceased were from the area: John Ashton of Cowhill and Thomas Buckley of Baretrees.

New markets in Europe and South America increased the demand for Britain&#x27;s cheap cotton goods. Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in the United States to Manchester. From the markets in Manchester, mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into yarn and cloth. Supplies were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–65 as a result of the American Civil War, leading to the formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis. Despite a brief economic depression, the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine. The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton&#x27;s plentiful cheap open land, used for farming since antiquity, vanished under distinctive rectangular multi-storey brick-built factories—35 by 1891. Chadderton&#x27;s former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a mill town around these factories and a network of newly created roads, canals and railways. The Chadderton landscape was &quot;dominated by mill chimneys, many with the mill name picked out in white brick&quot;. Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world) encroached upon Chadderton&#x27;s eastern boundary, urbanising the town and surrounds, and forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Royton, Lees and Shaw and Crompton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which at its peak was responsible for 13 per cent of the world&#x27;s cotton production. These Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road, by Chadderton&#x27;s eastern boundary with Oldham. Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926, and 6,000 people, a quarter of Chadderton&#x27;s population, worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century. Industries ancillary to cotton spinning, such as engineering, coal mining, bleaching and dyeing became established during this period, meaning the rest of Chadderton&#x27;s population were otherwise involved in the sector. Philip Stott was a Chadderton-born architect, civil engineer and surveyor of cotton mills. Stott&#x27;s mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom, multiplying the town&#x27;s industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity.

The boomtown of Chadderton reached its industrial zenith in the 1910s, with over 50 cotton mills within the town limits. A social consequence of this industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an extensive and enlarged working class community living in an urban sprawl of low quality terraced houses. However, Chadderton developed an abundance of civic institutions including public street lighting, Carnegie library, public swimming baths and council with its own town hall. The development of the town meant that the district council made initial steps to petition the Crown for honorific borough status for Chadderton in the 1930s. However, the Great Depression, and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns and textile goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton&#x27;s textile sector declined to a halt; cotton spinning reduced dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s and by 1997 only two mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Many of the redundant mills have now been demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton respectively.

===Post-industrial history===
During the second half of the 20th century, Chadderton experienced accelerated deindustrialisation along with economic decline. Large areas of Victorian and Edwardian era terraced housing were identified as unsuited for modern needs, and were subsequently demolished. However, the town&#x27;s population continued to grow as a result of urban renewal and modern suburban housing developments. During the 1970s and 1980s, redevelopment in the form of new shopping, health and leisure facilities contributed to the growth and renewal of Chadderton. In 1990, the new Firwood Park, on the west side of Chadderton, was said to be the largest private housing estate in Europe. Chadderton continued to be a regional hub for the secondary sector of the economy into the 21st century through BAE Systems and Zetex Semiconductors, though BAE Chadderton closed in March 2012. Other major employers include the Stationery Office and Trinity Mirror.

==Governance==

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, the boundaries of Chadderton have varied from time to time. Chadderton anciently formed part of the hundred of Salford for civil jurisdiction, but for manorial government, Chadderton was a constituent manor of the Fee of Tottington, whose overlords were the de Lacys, Barons of Clitheroe Castle. The de Chaddertons, Lords of the Manor of Chadderton, were accustomed to pay tax to the overlords until the division of Tottington. In 1507, two constables were appointed to uphold law and order in Chadderton. Following a court case, in 1713 it was agreed that of Northmoor be within Chadderton with the rest belonging to Oldham.

Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Chadderton formed part of the Oldham Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security. Chadderton&#x27;s first local authority was a local board of health established in 1873; Chadderton Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board became the Chadderton Urban District, a local government district within the administrative county of Lancashire. The urban district council, comprising 18 members, would later be based out of Chadderton Town Hall, a purpose built municipal building opened in 1913. In 1933, there were exchanges of land with the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Middleton and City of Manchester.

Chadderton was the second most populous urban district in the United Kingdom by the 1930s, and the district council took initial steps to obtain municipal borough status, but this was not achieved. In 1926 and 1931, two Oldham Extension Bills for the County Borough of Oldham to amalgamate with Chadderton Urban District were rejected by the House of Lords, following objections from neighbouring councils. A twinning arrangement was made in 1966 by Chadderton Urban District Council with Geesthacht, West Germany. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Chadderton Urban District was abolished, and Chadderton has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Chadderton has three of the twenty wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham: Chadderton North, Chadderton Central and Chadderton South., with some small peripheral areas lying in the neighbouring wards of Royton North, Coldhurst, Hollinwood, Werneth and Failsworth East.

In terms of parliamentary representation, Chadderton after the Reform Act 1832 was represented as part of the Oldham parliamentary borough constituency, of which the first Members of Parliaments (MPs) were the radicals William Cobbett and John Fielden. Winston Churchill was the MP between 1900 and 1906. Constituency boundaries changed during the 20th century, and Chadderton has lain within the constituencies of Middleton and Prestwich (1918–1950) and Oldham West (1950–1997). Since 1997, Chadderton has lain within Oldham West and Royton. It is represented in the House of Commons by Jim McMahon, a member of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
At (53.5462°, −2.1426°), and north-northwest of central London, Chadderton lies at the foothills of the Pennines, east-southeast of Middleton, and west of Oldham. It is in the northeast part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the UK&#x27;s third largest conurbation, on undulating land rising from above sea level in the west to in the east. Chadderton Heights, on the hillier northern edge of the town, is its highest point at .

The climate in the area, like most of northwest Europe, is maritime temperate, with significant precipitation throughout the year, averaging 1047 mm annually. The average annual temperature is 9.7 °C.

Chadderton&#x27;s modern commercial centre lies close to the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards into the rest of the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.
Chadderton&#x27;s built environment is distinguished by its former textile factories: &quot;The huge flat-topped brick mills with their square towers and their tall circular chimneys dwarf all other buildings.&quot; Rows of early-20th century terraced housing built to house Chadderton&#x27;s factory workers are a common type of housing stock throughout the town; narrow streets pass through these older housing areas.

Chadderton is contiguous with other settlements on all sides, including a shared boundary with the city of Manchester to the southwest.

Localities within Chadderton include Baretrees, Block Lane, Busk, Butler Green, Chadderton Fold, Chadderton Park, Coalshaw Green, Cowhill, Greengate, Firwood Park, Foxdenton, Healds Green, Middleton Junction, Mills Hill, Nimble Nook, Nordens, Stock Brook, Whitegate and White Moss. Chadderton Fold, the former centrepoint of Chadderton, lies on the banks of the River Irk, north-northwest of Chadderton&#x27;s modern commercial centre. Hollinwood, in pre-industrial times, was a moor or common of Chadderton, but was largely incorporated into neighbouring Oldham following a court case in 1713. In the mid-18th century a village emerged at Hollinwood along the common border of Oldham and Chadderton, and there were further exchanges of land at Hollinwood between Oldham Borough and Chadderton township in 1880. &quot;Chadderton (Detached)&quot; was, as its name implies, a detached area or exclave of Chadderton. Lying under Copster Hill in Oldham and including the area now known as Garden Suburb, its area was absorbed into neighbouring Oldham in 1880.

==Demography==

According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Chadderton (urban-core and sub-area) had a total resident population of 33,001. The population density was , with a 100 to 95.4 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 27.2 per cent were single (never married) 44.5 per cent married, and 8.5 per cent divorced. Chadderton&#x27;s 13,698 households included 28.8 per cent one-person, 38.7 per cent married couples living together, 8.9 per cent co-habiting couples, and 10.3 per cent single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 35.6 per cent had no academic qualifications.

At the 2001 UK census, 81.1 per cent of Chadderton&#x27;s residents reported themselves as being Christian, 3.2 per cent Muslim, 0.5 per cent Hindu, 0.1 per cent Buddhist, and 0.1 per cent Sikh. The census recorded 8.7 per cent as having no religion, 0.1 per cent had an alternative religion and 6.3 per cent did not state their religion.

Chadderton&#x27;s population has been described as broadly working class with pockets of lower middle class communities, particularly in the northeast of the town, near the border with Royton.

==Economy==

Up until the 18th century, the inhabitants of Chadderton raised domestic farm animals, supplementing their incomes by the spinning and weaving wool in the domestic system. Primitive coal mining was established by the 17th century, and the factory system adopted in the late-18th century. During the Victorian era, Chadderton&#x27;s economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industries, especially the spinning of cotton, but also the weaving of silk and production of hats. By the 20th century the landscape was covered with over 50 cotton mills. Industries ancillary to these sectors, including coal mining, brick making, mechanical engineering, and bleaching and dyeing were present. Chadderton developed an extensive coal mining sector auxiliary to Chadderton&#x27;s cotton industry and workforce. Coal was transported out of the township via the Rochdale Canal. The amount of coal was overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry; Chadderton&#x27;s last coal mine closed in 1920.

Since the deindustrialisation of the region in the mid-20th century, these industries have been replaced by newer sectors and industries, although many of the civic developments that accompanied industrialisation remain in the form of public buildings; a town hall, public baths and library. The few surviving cotton mills are now occupied by warehousing and distribution companies, or used as space for light industry.

British aircraft manufacturer Avro built a factory in south Chadderton in 1938–39, later known as BAE Chadderton. It was one of the largest employers in the area, producing a variety of aircraft models including Ansons, Manchesters and Bristol Blenheims. During the Second World War, 3,050 Avro Lancaster bombers were built at the Chadderton factory—over 40 per cent of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s fleet. Post World War Two the Avro Vulcan was designed and built, as well as the Avro Shackleton and Avro Lincoln. After the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, Avro became part of the nationalised British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) and produced commercial aircraft for Boeing and Airbus. It closed in 2012.

Chadderton has been described as a &quot;relatively prosperous town ... which makes it a popular residential area&quot;. Chadderton Mall is a shopping precinct located in the town centre, and is one of Chadderton&#x27;s main concentrations of retailing. It was constructed in 1974, and opened in 1975. It included at the time an Asda superstore which originally anchored the precinct, or district centre as the shopping precinct was originally known as, but moved to a new site on land just behind the original store in 1994, and it also contains a variety of smaller shops. The Stationery Office has a base in Chadderton, as does 3M. In 2008, 3M was the centre of a high-profile robbery of over 3,000 British passports. Other major businesses include Costco and Shop Direct Group. The centre (formerly Elk Mill Retail Park), is a retail park located at the start of the A627(M) motorway.

==Landmarks==
Chadderton Town Hall was the seat of Chadderton Urban District Council. It is Chadderton&#x27;s second town hall, the first was the former Chadderton Lyceum building (demolished in 1975). The current town hall, Chadderton&#x27;s first purpose built municipal building, was designed by Taylor and Simister of Oldham, and was opened in 1913 by Herbert Wolstencroft JP, the then chairman of Chadderton Urban District Council. The architectural style was intended to have &quot;a broad and strong treatment of the English Renaissance&quot;. It features &quot;charming gardens and a beautifully renovated ballroom&quot;. English Heritage granted it Grade II listed status in July 2013. Since 2007, Chadderton Town Hall has housed the Oldham Register Office, the civil registration authority for the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. It is a licensed venue for marriage ceremonies, and holds records of births, marriages and deaths which have taken place in what is now the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham from 1837 to the present.
Foxdenton Hall is a two-storey Georgian mansion and former manor house, with an English garden wall bond exterior and its own private gardens. The original Hall was erected in the mid-15th century as a home for the Radclyffes, who had acquired the title of joint Lords of the Manor with the Asshetons of Chadderton, through marriage. This Foxdenton Hall was demolished to make way for a second Hall, built in 1620. The ground floor of that second Hall now forms the basement of the present Hall, built in 1700. The building is described as &quot;a dignified early Georgian house, particularly rare in this part of the country&quot;. The Radclyffes moved out of Foxdenton Hall in the late 18th century, favouring properties they had purchased in Dorset, although they still maintained ownership. Foxdenton Hall and the adjoining Foxdenton Park were leased to Chadderton Council by the Radclyffes in 1922, when they opened to the public. In 1960 the council took over ownership of the Hall, by which time it was in a state of disrepair. Following protest about funding and the condition of the building, Foxdenton Hall was restored in 1965.

Chadderton War Memorial is located outside Chadderton Town Hall, and was originally erected &quot;in honour of the men of Chadderton who made the supreme sacrifice and in grateful remembrance of all who served their county&quot; during the First World War, but later, the Second World War. It is a granite obelisk fronted by three steps. At the front on a short plinth stands a bronze figure of an ordinary soldier, holding a rifle in his right hand. It was designed by Taylor and Simister and sculpted by Albert Toft. Chadderton War Memorial was commissioned by the Chadderton War Memorial Committee and unveiled on 8 October 1921 by Councillor Ernest Kempsey.

Chadderton Hall Park is a public park by the River Irk in the north of Chadderton, spanning an area of over , in what were once the gardens of the manorial Chadderton Hall. At the end of the 19th century they were leased to Joseph Ball, who transformed the hall and grounds into a pleasure garden, complete with a boating lake and a menagerie. The hall was demolished in 1939. The park is now owned by Oldham Council, the local authority, and was opened to the public in 1956. It was awarded Green Flag status in 2006.

==Transport==

Public transport in Chadderton is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), a county-wide public body with direct operational responsibilities, such as supporting (and in some cases running) local bus services and managing integrated ticketing in Greater Manchester.

===Roads===
Major A roads link Chadderton with other settlements, including the A663 road. Opened by Wilfrid William Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple in 1925, the arterial A663, named Broadway, bisects Chadderton from north to south and was &quot;a major factor in the unification and modernisation of the town&quot;. The A669 road, routed through Chadderton, connects Oldham with Middleton. At its eastern end is Chadderton&#x27;s town centre. The M62 motorway runs to the north of the area and is accessed via Broadway at junction 21 and junction 20 via the A627(M) motorway, which terminates close to Chadderton&#x27;s north-eastern boundary with Royton. The M60 motorway skirts the south of Chadderton, near Hollinwood. The section of the M60 through Chadderton was opened in autumn 2000.

===Railway===
Chadderton is served by two railway stations, just outside its western boundary: Mills Hill railway station, at its border with Middleton, and Moston railway station, at its border with New Moston, Manchester.

The Middleton Junction and Oldham Branch Railway was routed through Chadderton. Middleton Junction railway station was within the town limits. Opened on 31 March 1842, it closed in 1966. On 12 August 1914, Chadderton goods and coal depot was opened. The depot was at the end of a 1097 yards long branch which came off the Middleton Junction to Oldham line at Chadderton Junction. The line from Chadderton Junction to Oldham Werneth was closed on 7 January 1963, but Chadderton goods and coal depot remained open for a period. Electric tramways to and from Middleton opened in 1902. Tram services ran along Middleton Road and terminated in Chadderton. The final tram ran in 1935.

The Oldham Loop Line closed as a heavy rail line in 2009 and reopened in June 2012 as part of a new Manchester Metrolink light rail line from Manchester Victoria to Rochdale, via Oldham. South Chadderton, Freehold and Hollinwood were part of the conversion to Metrolink. Proposals to extend the Metrolink system through Chadderton were announced in January 2016; the proposed link would add a spur between Westwood tram stop and Middleton with the line continuing to the Bury line near Bowker Vale.

===Buses===
The majority of the bus services in Chadderton are operated by First Greater Manchester, who run services 24, 58, 59, 181 and 182, which provide frequent services from Chadderton town centre to Middleton, Oldham and Shaw, with other services running to Manchester, Royton and Rochdale. Manchester Community Transport run services 159 and 419 linking the town centre with Oldham, Middleton, Hollinwood, Woodhouses, Failsworth, New Moston, Werneth and Ashton-under-Lyne. Service 415 links the Cowhill and Nimble Nook areas of Chadderton with Middleton and Oldham, while services 81 and 81a operate through South Chadderton providing services to Manchester via Moston and to Oldham, Holts and Derker. These services are operated by First Greater Manchester.

In the North Chadderton area, Rosso operate service 412 to Middeton via Mills Hill and Boarshaw and to Oldham via Royton while First Bus operate service 149 from Park Estate to North Manchester General Hospital via Oldham, Hollinwood and Blackley.

In the Greengate area of the town Stagecoach Manchester provides the following bus services. 112/113 – to Middleton via Middleton Junction and to Manchester city centre via Moston and Collyhurst. 114 – to Middleton via Alkrington and Manchester City Centre via Moston and Collyhurst. 294 offers two early morning one way services to the Trafford Centre via Moston, Cheetham Hill and Salford Quays. Citibus was a Chadderton-based commercial bus operator serving Greater Manchester, launched in 1986. It competed with the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive until 1995, when it was bought-out by GM Buses North, in what is now First Manchester.

==Education==

An old style grammar school at Healds Green in Chadderton was built and founded in 1789. As the population of Chadderton grew during the 19th century, more schools were opened, each linked with a local church. Mills Hill School began as a voluntary aided school belonging to the local Baptist church. Further schoolrooms from this period were found at Cowhill Methodist Church and Washbrook Methodist Church, opened in 1855 and 1893 respectively.

Chadderton Grammar School was the first new style co-educational grammar school opened by Lancashire County Council. It was opened by David Lindsay, 28th Earl of Crawford, on 18 October 1930. In 1959, it became the Girls&#x27; Grammar, when a separate school for boys was opened. The Girls&#x27; Grammar briefly became Mid-Chadderton School, and later The Radclyffe School, and the boys&#x27; school part of North Chadderton School. Radclyffe and North Chadderton are today the town&#x27;s two co-educational, non-denominational, comprehensive secondary schools. North Chadderton School has a sixth form college for 16- to 19-year-olds. The Radclyffe School, which has specialist Technology College status, was modernised in 2008 by way of a £30 million new school complex opened by Sir Alex Ferguson on 8 July 2008. The Blessed John Henry Newman RC College opened in 2011 on the Broadway site previously occupied by The Radclyffe School.

==Religion==

Chadderton had no medieval church of its own, and until 1541, for ecclesiastical purposes, lay within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield. The diocese was then divided, and Chadderton became part of the Diocese of Chester. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present Diocese of Manchester was created. For ritual baptisms, marriages and burials, the people of Chadderton, a Christian community, had to travel to churches that lay outside of the township&#x27;s boundaries, including Oldham St Mary&#x27;s, Middleton St Leonard&#x27;s, and Prestwich St Mary&#x27;s. The route of some of the ancient paths to these churches is preserved in the modern layout of some of the town&#x27;s roads.

Chadderton&#x27;s first established church was St Margaret of Antioch which was consecrated in 1769 at Hollinwood, however late 19th century boundary changes means it now lies within neighbouring Oldham.

The New Parishes Act 1844 allowed for the creation of a parish for Chadderton, dedicated to St Matthew the Evangelist. Services were initially held in the stables of Chadderton Hall, and then in a temporary wooden structure opened in 1848. The Church of St Matthew was opened for the parish in 1857 by the then Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. A steeple was added in 1881. Following the construction of this church, four followed. There are now several Anglican parishes, and within them daughter and mission churches, serving the town. The parish of St Matthew united with the neighbouring parish of St Luke, and the United Benefice of St Matthew with St Luke now lies within the Oldham West Deanery of the Diocese of Manchester. The parish of Christ Church, founded in 1870, which also contains the church of St Saviour&#x27;s and Crossley Christian Centre, is one of the largest numerically in the township and lies on the border with Werneth. The parish of Emmanuel, now meeting in the St George&#x27;s building on Broadway, was originally part of Christ Church parish. Also within this deanery is the Parish Church of St Mark, built in the early 1960s. It is a blue brick building with a graduated slate pitched roof, and a rectangular brick steeple with a high gabled roof. It was granted Grade II listed building status in 1998.

In addition to the Church of England, a variety of other Reformed denominations have been practised in Chadderton. Nonconformism was popular in Chadderton, and places of worship for Methodism, Baptist and Congregationalism were built during the 19th and 20th centuries. Washbrook Methodist Church and School at Butler Green was built in 1868, but was demolished around 1970 to be replaced by South Chadderton Methodist Church formed from the amalgamation of five Methodist congregations.

Chadderton forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford. The Roman Catholic Parish of Corpus Christi was founded in Chadderton in 1878, following immigration to the region by Irish Catholics fleeing the Great Famine. A combined school and church was opened in 1904. A further Catholic parish for Chadderton, dedicated to Saint Herbert, was created in 1916. Its first mass was held on 1 July 1916, the day the Battle of the Somme began.

==Sport==
Chadderton F.C. is an association football club, formed in 1947 under the name Millbrow Football Club; it later changed to North Chadderton Amateurs, before adopting its present name in 1957. It plays in the North West Counties Football League First Division. Past players have included former England national football team captain David Platt, former Leeds United A.F.C. and Crystal Palace F.C. player John Pemberton and Northern Ireland national football team player Steve Jones. Mark Owen of pop group Take That briefly played for the club. Chaddertonians A.F.C. were formed in 1937 and currently play in the Lancashire Amateur League. Chadderton Park F.C. is an amateur football club founded in 1977. Oldham Borough F.C., formerly Oldham Dew and Oldham Town, were a Chadderton-based North West Counties League football club formed in 1964. They played at Nordens Road, Chadderton before moving to the Whitebank Stadium in Oldham in the early 1990s.

An earlier, but short-lived, version of Chadderton F.C. briefly played in the Manchester Football League in the early part of the 20th century. Joining the league in the 1905–06 season, the club ran into serious difficulties and were unable to complete the season. The club&#x27;s record for the season was expunged.

The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was a public swimming facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths, where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which could have put the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon. The Wellbeing Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms and café.

==Public services==
Policing in Chadderton is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The force&#x27;s &quot;(Q) Division&quot; has its headquarters for policing the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham in central Oldham. Greater Manchester Police have two stations in Chadderton: a Victorian building in central Chadderton, and a modern purpose-built station at Broadgate in southern Chadderton. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, who have a fire station in Chadderton, on Broadway.

There are no hospitals in Chadderton—the nearest are in the larger settlements of Oldham and Rochdale—but some local health care is provided by Chadderton Town and South Chadderton health centres which are commissioned by NHS Oldham. The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport in the area. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by several small specialist clinics and surgeries.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill at the Beal Valley. United Utilities manages Chadderton&#x27;s drinking and waste water. Water supplies are sourced from several reservoirs in the borough, including Dovestones and Chew. A sewage treatment works is located in the southwest of Chadderton, at Foxdenton. It opened in 1898.

A power station in Chadderton existed in as early as 1925, built for the County Borough of Oldham in the Slacks Valley. This structure was demolished to make way for the new Chadderton &quot;B&quot; Power Station, opened in 1955 for the British Electricity Authority in anticipation that the region would experience increased demand for electricity. Structural changes to the National Grid made the power station redundant in 1982. It was sold by the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1984, and demolished in 1986. Chadderton&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is United Utilities.

==Notable people==

People from Chadderton are called Chaddertonians. Historically, Chadderton was chiefly distinguished by the presence of ruling families, including the Asshetons, Radclyffes, Hortons and Chaddertons. Within the extended Chadderton/Chaderton family, two ecclesiastically notable persons were William Chaderton (medieval academic and bishop) and Laurence Chaderton (the first Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, a leading Puritan and one of the original translators of the Authorised King James Version of the Bible).

<doc id="441670" wikidata="Q642314" url="?curid=441670" title="County of Burgundy">
<text>The Free County of Burgundy (; ) was a medieval feudal state ruled by a count from 982 to 1678. It was also known as Franche-Comté, and was located in the modern region of Franche-Comté. It bordered the Duchy of Burgundy to the west, which was part of France from 843.

The territory had previously been part of the kingdom of Upper Burgundy (888–933). The county was formed in 982 by Otto-William for the lands he held in the Kingdom of Arles (outside the duchy&#x27;s borders). In 1032, the Kingdom of Arles was inherited by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, who incorporated the County of Burgundy into the Holy Roman Empire (HRE). The county briefly gained independence in the 12th century, before being re-incorporated into the empire by Frederick Barbarossa.

As a state of the HRE, the county was granted a high degree of autonomy. The largest city, Besançon, was granted the status of free imperial city. The rest of the county was given imperial immediacy (making it an imperial county) and its rulers were given the title of , from which the French and English names of the county are derived.

From 1295 the county began to fall under the increasing influence of France and the House of Burgundy, which ruled the duchy. From 1330 to 1361 and again from 1405 to 1477, there was a personal union between the county (part of the HRE) and the adjacent duchy (part of France). In 1493, the county was transferred to the House of Habsburg, which ruled it until it was conquered by France in 1674. French rule was made permanent by the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678.

== Formation within the kingdom of Arles ==
The area previously formed part of the Kingdom of the Burgundians, which had been annexed by the Franks in 534 and incorporated into the Kingdom of the Franks. The Empire was partitioned in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun, with the area west of the Saône river being allotted to West Francia as the French Duchy of Burgundy, while the southern and eastern parts of the former Burgundian kingdom fell to Middle Francia under Emperor Lothair I. This Middle Frankish part became the two independent entities of southern Lower Burgundy in 879 and northern Upper Burgundy under King Rudolph I in 888. The region that would become Franche-Comté was then included in Upper Burgundy, centred around the city of Besançon. In 933, with the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, Lower and Upper Burgundy were re-united under King Rudolph II as the Kingdom of Arles (Arelat).

In 982, Otto-William (son of Adalbert of Lombardy) married Ermentrude of Roucy. Ermentrude was a widow, whose previous husband had been count of Mâcon (in the Duchy of Burgundy) and controlled additional lands around Besançon and Dole. These lands were then ruled by Otto-William in right of his wife. Otto-William was already the adopted heir of Henry I, Duke of Burgundy, so expected to inherit the entire duchy when Henry died. The lands outside the duchy, that Otto-William had acquired through Ermentrude, were organised as the new County of Burgundy.

Henry I died in 1002, at which point Otto-William claimed the Duchy of Burgundy. However, king Robert II of France refused to recognise the adoption and claimed the duchy as the nephew of Henry I. This started a war between the two claimants. After a few years of conflict, Robert II prevailed in the duchy; he would later grant it to his son Robert I, Duke of Burgundy, keeping the Crown of his elder son Hugues. Otto-William remained in control of the county of Mâcon, and therferore strengthened its grip in the County, fief of the Kingdom of Burgundy.

Otto-William and Ermentrude became the progenitors of the Anscarid dynasty. The development of commercial routes across the Jura mountains and the development of salt mines assured the prosperity of the county, and for several decades its towns preserved their freedom and neutrality.

== As part of the Holy Roman Empire ==

The Arelat kingdom collapsed with the extinction the ruling line in 1032. The Kingdom of Burgundy was inherited by the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II of the Salian dynasty, while the Duchy of Burgundy returned to a cadet branch of the French Capetian dynasty. As a result, the County of Burgundy became a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.

At the end of the 11th century Conrad&#x27;s son Emperor Henry III elevated the Archbishop of Besançon to the dignity of an archchancellor and conferred upon Besançon the rank of a (imperial city) under the Emperor&#x27;s direct patronage. Guy of Burgundy, brother of Renaud II, later became pope and negotiated the Concordat of Worms with Emperor Henry V. In the 12th century, Imperial protection allowed for the development of Besançon, but in 1127, after the assassination of William III, his cousin Renaud III shook off the Imperial yoke and refused to pay homage to Lothair III (at the time still Lothair II of Germany). After 10 years of conflict, Renaud was victorious. Burgundy was from then on called , the &quot;free county&quot;.

Emperor Frederick Barbarossa re-established imperial influence. Frederick took the brother of Count William IV prisoner, then when William died Frederick married William&#x27;s niece and heir, Beatrice I (daughter of Renaud III). Upon Emperor Frederick&#x27;s death in 1190, his younger son Otto I received the county of Burgundy and assumed the rare (possibly unique) title of archcount. He was succeeded by his daughter, Beatrice II, and her husband Otto I, Duke of Merania; they were in turn followed by their son, Otto III, Count of Burgundy (), and their daughter, Adelaide (alias Alix of Méran, ).

The Counts Palatine for many years had to share power with the greater feudal families of the county, notably with the family of Chalon, which was descended from Stephen III, count of Auxonne, grandson of William IV and Beatrice of Thiern, the heir of the county of Chalon. In 1237, count John &quot;the Old&quot; of Chalon, transferred his possessions under the French Crown (including Chalon and Auxerre) to the Duke of Burgundy in exchange for wealthy possessions in the County of Burgundy, including the salt mines of Salins-les-Bains (which became the autonomous Seigneurie of Salins). The authority of John the Old was re-established only by the marriage (around 1239) of his oldest son Hugh of Chalon with Adelaide, the sister of Otto III (died 1248) and heiress of Burgundy. However, this did not prevent a younger son, John I of Chalon-Arlay, from taking control of the vassal states.

Otto IV, son of Hugh and Adelaide, was the last of the feudal counts of Burgundy. He married first the daughter of the Count of Bar, but the marriage was childless. His second marriage was to the grandniece of King Louis IX of France, Countess Mahaut of Artois. This marriage brought the county under French influence. The daughters of Otto IV and Mahaut, Joan II and Blanche, married respectively Philip V and Charles IV of France, sons of King Philip IV. Jeanne became Queen of France after having been involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair. In that same affair, Blanche was found guilty of adultery and was imprisoned for the rest of her life.

== Burgundian unions ==
After quarrelling with his barons, and after a new revolt against the French carried out by John of Chalon-Arlay, Otto IV ceded the county to his daughter as a dowry and designated the King of France as administrator of the dowry in 1295. By marrying their daughter and heir Joan, Duke Odo IV of Burgundy reunited the duchy and the county under his rule, followed by his grandson Duke Philip I. The personal union was again broken when Philip died without heirs in 1361: the Duchy of Burgundy was seized as a reverted fief by King John II of France, while the Imperial county was inherited by Philip&#x27;s great aunt Margaret I, a granddaughter of Count Otto IV. In 1382, she bequeathed her estates to her son Count Louis II of Flanders. During the reign of Phillip the Bold, the County was organized into having a council and a parliament — centered in the capital Dole.

Louis II died in 1384 leaving no male heirs, so the County of Burgundy formed part of the immense dowry of his daughter Margaret, which in 1405 was inherited by her son, the Burgundian duke John the Fearless. The county and the duchy were again ruled in personal union by his descendants from the House of Valois-Burgundy until the death of Duke Charles the Bold at the 1477 Battle of Nancy. 

== Succession crisis ==
Since Duke Charles the Bold died without the mail hair, his daughter Mary of Burgundy, supported by her husband Archduke Maximilian of Austria, tried to secure inheritance over all of her fathers domains, including the County of Burgundy. That was opposed by the French King Louis XI of France, who immediately occupied the Duchy of Burgundy, and also took possession of the County. Though defeated at the 1479 Battle of Guinegate, the French retained the County by the Treaty of Arras in 1482. By that time, Mary of Burgundy died and her claims passed to her son Philip, who was styled as &quot;Philip IV&quot; in Burgundy, although at that time he was still a minor and thus under guardianship of his father Maximilian. Territorial disputes were settled by the Treaty of Senlis in 1493. The County was returned to Philip, while French kept the Duchy.

== Habsburg possession ==

Since the Treaty of Senlis (1493), the County of Burgundy was ruled by the Habsburgs. In 1512, it was included into the newly formed Burgundian Circle and administered as part of the Habsburg Netherlands. By that time, Philip died (1506) and was succeeded by his son Charles who was styled as &quot;Charles II&quot; in Burgundy. In 1508, Charles appointed an able administrator Mercurino di Gattinara as President of the County Parliament of Burgundy, and entrusted him with governance of the province. Gattinara remained at that post until 1518, when he succeeded Jean le Sauvage as the Grand Chancellor of Burgundy.

In 1516, Charles became the King of Spain and in 1519 he succeeded his grandfather Maximilian as the Holy Roman Emperor, thus becoming known as &quot;Charles V&quot;. In 1521, Charles decided to relinquish direct rule over old Austrian domains to his brother Ferdinand, but without Burgundian lands, that were kept by Charles as his own domain within the Empire. All of his Burgundian lands were later passed to his son Philip II of Spain, thus solidifying the political ties between Habsburg domains in Burgundy and the Habsburg Spain. Although ruled by Spanish Habsburgs, the County was never annexed into the Kingdom of Spain, and thus remained a domain within the Holy Roman Empire.

Since that time, the County gained geopolitical and military importance, since it was situated between Habsburg possessions in the Low Countries and Italy. The Spanish Road trade route ran through the County, connecting those Habsburg domains. During Habsburg rule, the County was prosperous and had autonomy. Dole&#x27;s parliament was the political center, and a governor was chosen from the local nobility. Taxes were low, and there was not much conscription either. The city of Besancon had many fairs and many renaissance structures were constructed.

The County was invaded by France in 1668, as part of the War of Devolution. Multiple cities surrendered to the French after little fighting, but were returned as part of the wider Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle later that year.

== Conquest by France ==
France invaded again in 1674, as part of the Franco-Dutch War, again overrunning the country with little resistance. The Treaties of Nijmegen ended the war in 1678; as part of the third treaty (between France and Spain), the county was transferred to France in exchange for the return of French-occupied territory in the Spanish Netherlands.

The territory of Franche-Comté has remained part of France uninterrupted ever since; it now forms part of the administrative region Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.

<text>The Duchy of Burgundy emerged in the 9th century as one of the successors of the ancient Kingdom of the Burgundians, which after its conquest in 532 had formed a constituent part of the Frankish Empire. Upon the 9th-century partitions, the French remnants of the Burgundian kingdom were reduced to a ducal rank by King Robert II of France in 1004. Robert II&#x27;s son and heir, King Henry I of France, inherited the duchy but ceded it to his younger brother Robert in 1032.

The other portions of the Kingdom of the Burgundians had passed to the Imperial Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles, including the County of Burgundy (Franche-Comté).

Robert became the ancestor of the ducal House of Burgundy, a cadet branch of the royal Capet dynasty, ruling over a territory that roughly conformed to the borders and territories of the modern region of Burgundy (Bourgogne). Upon the extinction of the Burgundian male line with the death of Duke Philip I in 1361, the duchy reverted to King John II of France and the royal House of Valois. The Burgundian duchy was absorbed in a larger territorial complex after 1363, when King John II ceded the duchy to his younger son Philip. With his marriage with Countess Margaret III of Flanders, he laid the foundation for a Burgundian State which expanded further north in the Low Countries collectively known as the Burgundian Netherlands. Upon further acquisitions of the County of Burgundy, Holland, and Luxemburg, the House of Valois-Burgundy came into possession of numerous French and imperial fiefs stretching from the western Alps to the North Sea, in some ways reminiscent of the Middle Frankish realm of Lotharingia.

The Burgundian State, in its own right, was one of the largest ducal territories that existed at the time of the emergence of Early Modern Europe. After just over one hundred years of Valois-Burgundy rule, however, the last duke, Charles the Bold, rushed to the Burgundian Wars and was killed in the 1477 Battle of Nancy. The extinction of the dynasty led to the absorption of the duchy itself into the French crown lands by King Louis XI, while the bulk of the Burgundian possessions in the Low Countries passed to Charles&#x27; daughter, Mary, and her Habsburg descendants.

==Origins==

The Duchy of Burgundy was a successor of the earlier Kingdom of the Burgundians, which evolved out of territories ruled by the Burgundians, an East Germanic tribe that arrived in Gaul in the 5th century. The Burgundians settled in the area around Dijon, Chalon-sur-Saône, Mâcon, Autun and Châtillon-sur-Seine, and gave the name to the region. The Kingdom of the Burgundians was annexed by the Merovingian King of the Franks, Childebert I, in 534, following their defeat by the Franks. It was recreated, however, on several occasions when Frankish territories were redivided between the sons on the death of a Frankish king.

As part of the Kingdom of the Franks, Burgundy maintained a semi-autonomous existence, with the Burgundians maintaining their own law code, the &quot;Loi Gombette&quot;. However, southern Burgundy was pillaged by the Saracen invasion of the 8th century. When Charles Martel drove the invaders out, he divided Burgundy into four commands: Arles-Burgundy, Vienne-Burgundy, Alamanic Burgundy and Frankish Burgundy. He appointed his brother Childebrand governor of Frankish Burgundy. Under the Carolingians, Burgundian separatism lessened and Burgundy became a purely geographical term, referring only to the area of the counties of the former Burgundy.

Both the Duchy of Burgundy and the County of Burgundy emerged from these counties, aided by the collapse of Carolingian centralism and the division of the Frankish domains brought about by the Partition of Verdun in 843. In the midst of this confusion, Guerin of Provence attached himself to Charles the Bald, youngest son of King Louis the Pious of the Franks, and aided him in the Battle of Fontenay against Charles&#x27;s eldest brother, the Emperor Lothar. When the Frankish kingdom in the west was divided along the boundary of the Saône and Meuse (dividing geographical Burgundy in the process), Guerin was rewarded for his services by the king by being granted the administration of the counties of Chalon and Nevers, in which he was by custom expected to appoint viscounts to rule as his deputies. As a vital military defender of the West Frankish border, Guerin was sometimes known by the Latin term for &quot;leader&quot; – &quot;dux&quot; or &quot;duke&quot;.

==Beneficiary dukes==

By the time of Richard the Justiciar (d. 921), the Duchy of Burgundy was beginning to emerge. Richard was officially recognised by the king as a duke; he also stood as individual count of each county he held (if it was not held on his behalf by a viscount). As Duke of Burgundy, he was able to wield an increasing amount of power over his territory. The term that came to be applied to the collective body of a duke&#x27;s territory was &quot;ducatus&quot;. Included in the Richard&#x27;s ducatus were the regions of Autunais, Beaunois, Avalois, Lassois, Dijonais, Memontois, Attuyer, Oscheret, Auxois, Duesmois, Auxerrois, Nivernais, Chaunois and Massois. Under Richard, these territories were given law and order, protected from the Normans, and served as a haven for persecuted monks.

Under Rudolph of France (also Raoul or Ralph), the son of Richard, Burgundy was briefly catapulted to a position of prominence in France, since he became King of France in 923 after acceding to the Burgundian territories in 921. It was from his territories in Burgundy that he drew the resources needed to fight those who challenged his right to rule.

Under Hugh the Black (d. 952) came the beginning of what would be a long and troubled saga for Burgundy. His neighbours were the Robertian family, who held the title of Duke of Francia. This family, wanting to improve their standing in France and against the Carolingian kings, attempted to subject the duchy to the suzerainty of their own duchy. They failed; eventually, when they appeared close to success, they were forced to scrap the scheme and instead maintain Burgundy as a separate duchy. Two brothers of Hugh Capet, the first Capetian King of France, took up the rule of Burgundy as duke. First Otto and then Henry the Venerable maintained the duchy&#x27;s independence, but the death of the latter without children proved a defining moment in the history of the duchy.

==Succession crisis of 1002==
Henry the Venerable died in 1002 leaving two potential heirs: his nephew, Robert the Pious, King of France, and his stepson, Otto-William, count of Mâcon (kingdom of France) and count of Burgundy (kingdom of Burgundy), whom Henry had adopted. Robert claimed the duchy by his dual rights as feudal overlord and nearest blood-relative of the deceased. Otto-William disputed his claim as a potential heir, starting a war with the help of his son-in-law, Landry count of Nevers.

Had the two Burgundys been united, history would undoubtedly have taken a different course; a Burgundy united under the German Otto-William would have been within the sphere of influence of the Holy Roman Empire and would have affected the balance of power between the French and the Germans. However, it was not to be; although it took him thirteen years of bitter and prolonged battle, Robert eventually secured the duchy for the French crown by gaining control of all the Burgundian counties west of the Saône, including Dijon; prospects of a united Burgundy evaporated, and the duchy became irreversibly French in outlook.

For a time, the duchy formed part of the royal domain; but the French crown could not hope at this time to administer such a volatile territory. The realities of power combined with Capetian family feuding: Robert the Pious gave the territory to his younger son and namesake, Robert I, Duke of Burgundy. When King Henry I of France, acceding in difficult circumstances (1031), found it necessary to secure the loyalty of Robert, his brother, he further enhanced the rights given to his brother (1032). Robert was to be Duke of Burgundy; as ruler of the duchy, he would &quot;enjoy the freehold thereof&quot;, and have the right &quot;to pass it on to his heirs&quot;. Future dukes were to owe allegiance only to the crown of France and be overlords of the duchy, beneath the ultimate authority of the kings of France. Robert gladly agreed to this arrangement, and the era of the Capetian dukes began.

==Capetian dukes==

Robert found that it was largely a theoretical power that he had been granted. Between the reign of Richard the Justiciar and Henry the Venerable, the duchy had fallen into anarchy, a condition heightened by the war of succession between Robert the Pious and Count Otto-William. The dukes had given away most of their lands to secure the loyalty of their vassals; consequently, they lacked power in the duchy without the support and obedience of their vassals. In addition, the Abbot of Cluny claimed immunity from secular overlords, while the Bishop of Langres was a duke and peer of France.

Robert and his heirs were faced with the task of restoring the ducal demesne and strengthening ducal power. In this, it would be seen, the dukes were well-suited to the task: none were remarkable or outstanding men who swept all opposition away before them; rather, they were persevering, methodical, realistic, able and willing to seize any opportunity presented to them. They used the Law of Escheat to their advantage: Auxois and Duesmois fell into ducal hands through reversion, these feudatories having no heir able to administer them. They purchased both land and vassalage, which built up both the ducal demesne and the number of vassals dependent upon the dukes. They made an income for themselves by demanding cash payments in exchange for recognition of a lord&#x27;s feudal rights within the duchy, by skillful management of loans from Jewish and Lombard bankers, by the careful administration of feudal dues and by the ready sale of immunities and justice.

The duchy itself benefited from the rule of the Capetians. As time passed, the state was built up and stabilised; a miniature court in imitation of the royal court at Paris grew around the dukes; the Jours Generaux, a replica of the Parlement of Paris sat at Beaune; bailiffs were imposed over the provosts and lords of the manor responsible for local government, while the duchy was divided into five bailiwicks.

The duchy became increasingly involved in the Reconquista in Spain at the end of the eleventh century, campaigning against Muslim taifas and forming marriage alliances with the Spanish royalty. Robert&#x27;s daughter Constance married King Alfonso VI of León and Castile, and his grandson Henry married Theresa of León to found the Portuguese House of Burgundy. With the advent of First Crusade, the attention of Burgundian dukes shifted to the Holy Land, and Odo I, Duke of Burgundy died during the Crusade of 1101. 

Under the competent leadership of Robert II (r. 1271–1306), one of the more notable dukes of the Capetian period, Burgundy reached new levels of political and economic prominence. Previously, the development of the duchy had been impeded by the bestowal of minor lands and titles on younger sons and daughters, diminishing the ducal fisc. Robert firmly ended this practice, stating in his will that he left to his eldest son and heir, Hugh, and after Hugh to his heir, &quot;all the fiefs, former fiefs, seigneuries and revenue... belonging to the duchy&quot;. The younger children of Robert would receive only annuities; since these derived from property held by Hugh, these younger children would need to owe liege homage to ensure their income.

Hugh V died in 1315; his brother Odo IV succeeded. Himself the grandson of King Louis IX of France by his mother, Agnes of France, he would also be the brother-in-law of two French kings – Louis X, married to his sister Marguerite, and Philip VI, married to his sister Joan – and the son-in-law of a third, Philip V, whose daughter Joan III, Countess of Burgundy, he married. Previous attempts to gain territory through marriage – Hugh III and the Dauphiné, Odo III and Nivernais, Hugh IV and the Bourbonnais – had failed; Odo IV&#x27;s wife Joan, however, was sovereign Countess of Burgundy and Artois, and the marriage reunited the Burgundys again.

They were not, however, reunited for long. The marriage of Duke Odo and Countess Joan in 1318 produced only one surviving child, Philip; he married another Joan, the heiress of Auvergne and Boulogne, but they again only produced a single surviving child, Philip I, Duke of Burgundy, also known as Philip of Rouvres. The elder Philip predeceased both of his parents in an accident with a horse in 1346; Countess Joan III followed him to the grave a year later, and the death of Odo IV in 1349 left the survival of the duchy dependent upon the survival of the young duke, a young child of two-and-a-half, and the last of the direct line of descent from Duke Robert I.

By inheritance, Philip of Rouvres was Duke of Burgundy from 1349. He had already been Count of Burgundy and Artois since the death of his grandmother, the Countess Joan of Burgundy and Artois, in 1347. In practice, though, the duke his grandfather had continued to rule over these counties as he had done since his marriage to Countess Joan, Philip of Rouvres being only a baby. With the old duke&#x27;s death, the duchy and its associated territories were governed by the young duke&#x27;s mother, Joan I, Countess of Auvergne and Boulogne, and by her second husband, King John the Good of France.

Richer promises were made to the young duke. He could expect to inherit Auvergne and Boulogne on his mother&#x27;s death, and a marriage was arranged between himself and the young heiress of Flanders, Margaret of Dampierre, who could promise to bring Flanders and Brabant to her husband eventually. By 1361, aged 17, he appeared to be on track to continue the duchy&#x27;s steady rise to greatness.

It was not to be, however. Philip became ill with the plague, a disease that all but inevitably promised a swift and agonising death. Fully expecting to die, the young duke made his last will and testament on 11 November 1361; ten days later, he was dead, and with him, his dynasty.

==Succession crisis of 1361==

Even before Philip&#x27;s death, France and Burgundy had begun considering the knotty problem of the succession. By the terms of his will, the duke had stated that he directed and appointed as heirs to his &quot;county, and to our possessions whatever they may be, those, male and female, who by law or local custom ought or may inherit&quot;. Since his domains all practiced succession by primogeniture, there was no question of his dominions passing en bloc to any one man or woman – they had come to Philip of Rouvres by different paths of inheritance, and so by the customs of the territories, they were required to pass to the next in line to inherit in each respective territory.

The counties of Auvergne and Boulogne – inherited by Philip upon his mother&#x27;s death a year earlier – passed to the next heir, Jean de Boulogne, the brother of Philip&#x27;s grandfather William XII of Auvergne. The counties of Burgundy and Artois passed to the sister of Philip&#x27;s grandmother Countess Joan, Margaret of France, herself the grandmother of Philip&#x27;s young bride Margaret of Dampierre.

The Duchy of Burgundy, however, proved a greater challenge to jurists. In the duchy, as in much of Europe at this time, two principles of inheritance were held valid: that of primogeniture and that of proximity of blood. A case of primogeniture was the succession of the English crown in 1377, which at the death of Edward III was inherited by his grandson Richard, the eldest son of his deceased eldest son Edward, rather than by his son John of Gaunt, the eldest of Edward III&#x27;s sons still living. A case of proximity of blood was that of Artois in 1302, which had on the death of Count Robert II been inherited by Mahaut, his eldest living daughter, rather than by his grandson Robert, the eldest son of the count&#x27;s already deceased son. In some cases, the two principles were able to mesh together: in the case of Boulogne and Auvergne, for example, John was the second son of Robert of Auvergne, Philip&#x27;s great-grandfather, and the nearest ancestor to Philip to have surviving lines of descent following Philip&#x27;s death. John was therefore both the most senior heir to Robert following Philip&#x27;s death and also the closest to Robert by descent. In the same manner, Margaret of France was the closest heir by both primogeniture and proximity to her mother, Joan of Châlons, Countess of Burgundy and Artois, Philip&#x27;s great-grandmother and, again, the nearest ancestor of Philip to have lines of descent surviving the Duke&#x27;s death.

The situation for the Duchy of Burgundy, however, was not so simple. In terms of inheritance, the nearest ancestor to Philip of Rouvres to have lines of descent surviving Philip&#x27;s death was his great-grandfather, Duke Robert II, the father of Odo IV. Unlike Joan of Châlons and Robert of Auvergne, however, both of whom had left only two lines of descent (allowing the cadet line to inherit without controversy following the termination of the main branch with Philip), Robert II had left three lines of descent: the main line, through Odo IV, which had ended with Philip, and two cadet lines through his daughters, Margaret and Joan. Both women were long dead. Margaret of Burgundy, the elder daughter, and the wife of Louis X of France, had died in 1315, leaving only a daughter, Joan II of Navarre. Joan of Burgundy, the younger daughter, and the wife of Philip VI of France, had died in 1348, leaving two sons, John II of France and Philip of Orléans. Out of these three, Joan of Burgundy&#x27;s sons were still alive; Joan II, however, had died in 1349, leaving three sons, the eldest of whom was Charles II of Navarre.

To the jurists of the duchy, these facts presented something of a difficult legal problem, for the two claims stood more or less equally in terms of justification: Charles II, as the great-grandson of Robert II by his elder daughter, had a superior claim to John II in terms of primogeniture; John II, as the grandson of Robert II by his younger daughter, had a superior claim to Charles II in terms of proximity of blood.

Were it simply a legal issue, the King of Navarre would certainly have had as good a chance of inheritance as the King of France, and perhaps better: proximity of blood was beginning to lose force in Europe, and, as events would subsequently prove, Burgundy had no intention of being absorbed into the French royal domain. But there was more in play than a simple legal issue: the Hundred Years&#x27; War was in full flow, and the King of Navarre, as an ally of England and an enemy of France, was distasteful to the Burgundians, who in meetings of the Estates during John II&#x27;s English captivity had been consistently loyal to John and his son the Dauphin, and opposed to the King of Navarre.

Furthermore, John II had the support of John of Boulogne and Margaret of France. The former was a staunch ally of the king, an alliance strengthened by the marriage between the king and Joan of Boulogne, John of Boulogne&#x27;s niece. As the daughter of a former King of France and one of the last living members of the senior branch of the House of Capet, the latter was staunchly French in her sympathies; besides which, Charles II had offended her by laying claim to lands in Champagne that had formed part of her sister Joan of France&#x27;s dowry in marrying Odo IV and which were deemed now to pass to Joan&#x27;s sister. These lands had derived from Joan I of Navarre, Countess of Champagne, grandmother of Margaret and Joan, and as the senior heir by primogeniture of Joan I, Charles was now laying claim to them. With this triple compact between the three heirs, Charles II was shut out: the support of a co-heir carried weight in deciding inheritance, and John II had the support of both, while Charles II had the support of neither. The nobility of the duchy, in the face of this, decided in favour of John II, who took immediate possession. He had already mobilised soldiers in Nivernais to do so by force if it proved necessary, but in fact, the nobility willingly swore homage to him as their new duke, and the duchy saw only a few isolated and half-hearted acts of rebellion in favour of Charles II.

==John II of France and Burgundy==
The legal implications of the accession of John the Good are frequently misunderstood. It is not uncommon to read that, upon the death of Philip of Rouvres, &quot;the Duchy of Burgundy, lying within France, therefore escheated to the French crown.&quot; This claim is simply untrue; the duchy had been granted to the heirs of Robert I, and were it not for the manner in which the descendants of Duke Robert II married and the circumstances under which Philip of Rouvres died, John II, who made his claim to the duchy as the son of Joan of Burgundy and the grandson of Robert II, rather than as the feudal overlord of all France, would never have inherited it.

The claim, however, that upon his inheritance of the duchy it was merged with the crown is more difficult to refute: for while this in itself certainly was not the case, he immediately attempted to merge the duchy into the crown by means of letters patent. He proclaimed in the relevant document that he was taking possession by virtue of his descent from the dukes and continued that as the duke, he immediately gave the duchy to the French crown, with which it was to be inseparably united (much the same as would be followed in the case of Brittany in 1532). Had this come into effect, Burgundy as an independent duchy would have ceased to exist, and John would no longer have been the duke. As a result, a definitive break in the duchy&#x27;s history would have occurred.

John, however, failed to grasp the realities of the political situation within the duchy. He had already been smoothly accepted as duke. On 28 December 1361, he received the homage of the Burgundian nobility before he returned to France, leaving the Count of Tancarville as his deputy, but the Burgundian estates had, in their meeting around the time of the homage-swearing of 28 December, firmly given several pronouncements. They declared that the duchy intended to remain a duchy, that it had no intention of becoming a province of the royal domain, that there would be no administrative changes, and that it was joined to France by virtue of one man&#x27;s rights and would never be absorbed into it. Most importantly, it was firmly stated that there had not been, and never would be, an annexation of Burgundy by France, merely juxtaposition – the king was also the duke, but there would be no deeper link than that.

Set against these declarations of Burgundian autonomy was the decree of John II that Burgundy was absorbed into the French crown. The latter proved to no avail. The Burgundians refused to countenance the terms of the letters patent. The king proved unequal to the task of enforcing his policy, which was far beyond his political capabilities. In the face of a non-violent but firm refusal by the Burgundians to allow the independence of their duchy to be threatened, the king quietly scrapped the letters patent, and instead turned to other means.

The king&#x27;s youngest son, Philip the Bold, was also his favourite most renowned. Philip had distinguished himself in 1356 at the Battle of Poitiers, when at the age of fourteen he bravely fought alongside his father to the bitter end. It occurred to him to both honour his son and soothe the ruffled feelings of the Burgundians by investing him as Duke of Burgundy. Accordingly, the king appointed Philip governor of Burgundy in late June 1363, following which the estates of Burgundy – who had consistently opposed the previous governor, Tancarville – loyally granted him subsidies. Finally, in the final months of John the Good&#x27;s reign, Philip the Bold was established as Duke of Burgundy. The king secretly created him duke on 6 September 1363 (in his dual role as duke giving his own title to his child and as king sanctioning this change in leadership) and, on 2 June 1364, following the death of King John, King Charles V issued a letters patent to publicly establish the fact of Philip&#x27;s title.

==Valois dukes==

Under the Valois dukes of Burgundy, the duchy flourished. A match between Philip the Bold and Margaret of Dampierre – the widow of Philip of Rouvres – not only reunited the duchy with the County of Burgundy once more, as well as with the County of Artois, but also served to bring the wealthy counties of Flanders, Nevers and Rethel under the control of the dukes. By 1405, following the deaths of Philip and Margaret, and the inheritance of the duchy and most of their other possessions by their son John the Fearless, Burgundy stood less as a French fief and more as an independent state. As such, it was a major political player in European politics. The Burgundian State was reckoned to include not only the original territories of the duchy of Burgundy in what is now eastern France, but also the northern territories that came to the dukes through the marriage of Philip and Margaret.

Philip the Bold had been a cautious man in politics. His son, John the Fearless (r. 1404–1419), however, was not, and under him Burgundy and Orléans clashed as the two sides squabbled for power. The result was an increase of Burgundy&#x27;s power, but the Burgundian State came to be regarded as an enemy of the French crown. From John&#x27;s death, the dukes were treated with caution or outright hostility by Charles VII and his successor, Louis XI.

The last two dukes to directly rule the duchy, Philip the Good (r. 1419–1467) and Charles the Bold (r. 1467–1477), attempted to secure the independence of their state from the French crown. The endeavour failed; when Charles the Bold died in battle leaving no sons, Louis XI of France declared the duchy escheated and absorbed the territory into the French crown. Charles&#x27;s daughter, Mary, inherited the rest of his domain and claimed the Duchy of Burgundy. Her heirs called themselves dukes of Burgundy, refusing to accept the loss of the duchy. The War of the Burgundian Succession took place from 1477 to 1482. Eventually, King Louis XI of France and Archduke Maximilian of Austria, Mary&#x27;s widower, signed the Treaty of Arras (1482). Maximilian recognised the annexation of the Duchy and County of Burgundy and several other territories. France thus retained most of its Burgundian fiefdoms except for the affluent County of Flanders, which passed to Maximilian and Mary&#x27;s descendants (but soon rebelled). With the 1493 Treaty of Senlis, Maximilian regained for his and Mary&#x27;s descendants the County of Burgundy, Artois and Charolais, but the Duchy of Burgundy and Picardy were lost definitively to France.

==Aftermath==

In 1526, Mary&#x27;s grandson Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor was restored to the title and territory by the French King Francis I, under duress as part of the Treaty of Madrid. But Francis I repudiated the Treaty as soon as he was able, and Charles V never managed to secure control of the duchy. Further, with the abdication of Charles V as Holy Roman emperor, Henry II of France argued that since the main family line of the House of Habsburg had ceased ruling the Holy Roman Empire or Austria, the claim of the title by the Spanish Habsburgs was null and void. The territory of Burgundy remained part of France from then onwards. The title was occasionally resurrected for French princes, for example the grandson of Louis XIV (Louis, Duke of Burgundy) and the grandson of Louis XV, the short-lived Louis Joseph.

The current king of Spain, Felipe, claims the title &quot;Duke of Burgundy&quot;, and his predecessor&#x27;s coat of arms included the cross of Burgundy as a supporter. The cross of Burgundy was the flag of the Spanish Empire at its height.

<text>The Battle of Velasco, fought June 25-26, 1832, was the first true military conflict between Mexico and Texians in the Texas Revolution, colloquially referred to as the &quot;Boston Harbor of Texas&quot; It began when Texian Militia attacked Fort Velasco, located in what was then Velasco and what is now the city of Surfside Beach. The Mexican commander during the conflict, Domingo de Ugartechea, tried to stop the Texians, under John Austin, from transporting a cannon down the Brazos River to attack the city of Anahuac. The Texian Militia eventually prevailed over the Mexicans. Ugartechea surrendered after a two-day battle, once he realized he would not be receiving reinforcements, and his soldiers had almost run out of ammunition..

==Background==
After Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, it legalized immigration from the United States. It granted contracts to empresarios to settle immigrants from the United States and Europe in Mexican Texas. There were few Mexicans living at the time in the eastern section of this territory but, as the number of Anglo speakers living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities began to fear the United States would want to annex Texas. On April 6, 1830 the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and established customs houses in Texas to enforce the collection of customs duties. Mexican military officer Juan Davis Bradburn, formerly a United States citizen, was appointed commander of a new customs and garrison post on Galveston Bay. In October 1830, Bradburn established a post atop a bluff at the entrance to the Trinity River. The post became known as Anahuac.

In 1832, Mexican authorities established a small garrison at Velasco, a small community on the eastern bank of the Brazos River. The new post would have jurisdiction over all commerce entering the river from the Gulf of Mexico. A log stockade was built on flat ground approximately from the Brazos River, and an equal distance from the Gulf of Mexico. The stockade had an inner and an outer wall, with the between them filled with sand, earth, and shells. An embankment along the inner wall allowed musketeers to shoot without exposing more than their heads. In the center of the stockade, another embankment provided a mounting place for a nine-pound cannon. The cannon was on a swivel and could guard the entire mouth of the river, but was unable to point downwards to aim into the immediate vicinity. Approximately 100 troops were garrisoned at the fort, under the command of Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea.

==Prelude==
Bradburn was deeply unpopular with the Texian settlers. Tensions escalated in May 1832, when Bradburn arrested a local man, William Barret Travis, on charges of attempted insurrection to separate the territory from Mexico. Conviction on this charge would lead to Travis&#x27;s execution. When Travis&#x27;s business partner, Patrick Jack, made threats against Bradburn, he was also arrested. Jack&#x27;s brother organized a contingent of men to march from Brazoria to Anahuac. As the march began, John Austin, a member of the Brazoria Ayuntamiento, stopped to consult with Ugartechea, who recommended that Austin request that the men be remanded into civilian custody while they awaited a ruling from Bradburn&#x27;s superior. When presented with this request, several Mexican officers explained to Austin that the laws prevented them from turning the men over to civilian authorities. Placated, Austin returned home; on his arrival he learned that Bradburn&#x27;s men had arrested several Texians on suspicion of stealing horses. Austin was outraged and returned to Anahuac to join other Texian volunteers. 

By early June, over 150 Texian Militia had gathered under the command of Frank W. Johnson. On June 10, the insurgents occupied Anahuac and after a brief engagement with Mexican troops, the Texians withdrew to Turtle Bayou. Taking advantage of the civil war engulfing the Mexican interior, the Texians drafted the Turtle Bayou Resolutions. In this document, they declared themselves federalists who supported rebellious Mexican general Antonio López de Santa Anna and decried &quot;the present dynasty&quot; that gave them military order instead of civil authority. The resolutions encouraged other colonists to join them in laying siege to Anahuac.
After the resolutions were adopted on June 13, the group determined that Austin, Henry S. Brown, and William J. Russell would go to Brazoria to recruit reinforcements and retrieve several cannon that belonged to private citizens. No further attacks would take place in Anahuac until the cannon and reinforcements arrived.

On June 20, residents of Brazoria gathered in a town meeting to decide whether to support further armed resistance. The residents appointed a five-member committee to determine future actions. After some debate, the committee, which included Edwin Waller and Russell, unanimously voted for war. The larger group accepted their recommendations and declared opposition to the current administration. Austin was appointed to command the Texian Militia company, which comprised between 100 and 150 men. Austin quickly proposed that the group be given permission to attack the closest Mexican military installation, Fort Velasco, if necessary. This was the second time Austin had tried to get support to attack Velasco; his first attempt, on May 11, had been defeated by a single vote. This time, the new company agreed to the plan.

Deciding that it would be easiest to transport the cannon by boat down the Brazos River to the Gulf of Mexico, the men loaded the cannon onto the schooner &quot;Brazoria&quot;. Austin sent four men to Velasco to inform Ugartechea of their intent to transport cannon down the Brazos River. Ugartechea indicated that he would not allow the ship to pass; he knew that the cannon were most likely intended to create additional havoc in Anahuac.

==Battle==
At 10 a.m. on June 22, Austin and his men left Brazoria for the trip to the fort. Approximately 40 men boarded the &quot;Brazoria&quot; for the journey downstream, while the remaining men travelled overland. Russell was given command of the men aboard ship. Because only three of the volunteers had any familiarity with sailing, one of the mates of the &quot;Brazoria&quot; agreed to accompany the Texian Militia to ensure the ship arrived at its destination. Russell agreed that the seaman would not have to participate in the battle.

On the night of June 25, the Texians approached the fort. The schooner was anchored at a spot from the fort. Ground forces were split into two groups, commanded by Brown and Austin. Brown&#x27;s men would circle the fort and approach from the Gulf of Mexico side, using driftwood as cover. Austin&#x27;s men would approach from the north, where there was no natural cover. To protect themselves, this group fashioned makeshift shields out of cypress. The shields were thick and were supported by moveable legs.

Shortly before midnight, the Texians attacked. During the incessant firing that followed, Mexican troops shot out the &quot;Brazoria&quot;″s mooring lines. The ship ran aground on the bank. Texians soon ran low on ammunition for the cannon, but as the ship was fairly close to the fort, riflemen continued to fire. Mexican troops charged the schooner but were driven back. Austin&#x27;s men discovered that their portable palisades were ineffective against Mexican marksmen; after the battle one shield alone had 130 holes. To protect themselves, Austin&#x27;s men took time to dig trenches in the sand.

Thirty minutes after sunrise, a downpour began and the Texians retreated. Austin sent James Bailey back to Brazoria to gather reinforcements. Mexican troops were almost out of ammunition and Ugartechea surrendered.

==Aftermath==
Texians refused the first surrender proposal, which would allow the Mexican soldiers to leave Texas with all of their arms. After further negotiations between two of Ugartechea&#x27;s representatives, Lieutenant More and Ensign Rincon, and two of Austin&#x27;s representatives, William H. Wharton and Russell, Mexican soldiers were given permission to march out &quot;with their arms, ammunition, and baggage&quot; to a ship which would take them to Matamoros. The Mexican cannon and swivel gun would remain at Fort Velasco in the custody of the Texians. Wounded Mexican soldiers would remain in Texas and be cared for with &quot;good treatment and hospitality&quot;. Soldiers would take only the provisions they needed for the journey, with the rest remaining with the Texians.

Five Mexican troops were killed and sixteen were wounded. The Texians lost seven killed and fourteen wounded. One of the Texian casualties was the seaman from the &quot;Brazoria&quot;. When the battle began, Russell had sent the seaman below decks so that he would be safe. The man was killed when a Mexican cannon shot crashed through the side of the ship. The sustained bombardment had damaged the &quot;Brazoria&quot;, making it ineffective for transportation of the cannon. The Texians regrouped and prepared to march overland to Anahuac. As they readied for departure, they learned that Bradburn had resigned his position and the prisoners had been released. Austin and his men chose to remain in Brazoria.

<text>French is the sole official language in France according to the second article of the French Constitution. French, a Gallo-Romance language, is spoken by nearly the entire population of France.

In addition to French, several regional languages are also spoken to varying degrees, such as Alsatian, a German dialect (specifically Alemannic; spoken by 1.44% of the national population); Basque, a language isolate; Breton, a Celtic language (spoken by 0.61%); Corsican, an Italo-Dalmatian language; and various other Gallo-Romance languages (Langues d&#x27;oïl 1.25%, Occitan 1.33%). Some of these languages are also spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Andorra, or Spain.

==Status==

The official language of the French Republic is French (art. 2 of the French Constitution) and the French government is, by law, compelled to communicate primarily in French. The government, furthermore, mandates that commercial advertising be available in French (though it can also use other languages). The French government, however, does not mandate the use of French by private individuals or corporations or in any other media.

A revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles in July 2008.

The 1999 Report written for the government by Bernard Cerquiglini identified 75 languages that would qualify for recognition under the government&#x27;s proposed ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Of those languages, 24 are indigenous to the European territory of the state while all the others are from overseas areas of the French Republic (in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and South America).

Although ratification was blocked by the Constitutional Council as contradicting the Fifth Republic&#x27;s constitutional provision enshrining French as the language of the Republic, the government continues to recognise regional and minority languages to a limited extent (i.e. without granting them official status) and the &quot;Délégation générale à la langue française&quot; has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had &quot;et aux langues de France&quot; added to its title. The category of &quot;languages of France&quot; (in French: &quot;langues de France&quot;) is thus administratively recognised even if this does not go so far as to provide any official status. Following his election as president, François Hollande reasserted in 2012 his campaign platform to ratify the European Charter and ensure a clear legal framework for regional languages (within a programme of administrative decentralisation that would give competencies to the regions in language policy).

The regional languages of France are sometimes called &quot;patois&quot;, but this term (roughly meaning &quot;dialects&quot;) is often considered derogatory. &quot;Patois&quot; is used to refer to essentially oral languages, even though some have a current and/or historical use, such as Occitan, which was already being written at a time when French was not and its literature has continued to thrive, with a Nobel Prize for Frédéric Mistral in 1904.

It is estimated that at the time of the French Revolution in 1789, only half of the population of France could speak French, and as late as 1871 only a quarter spoke French as their native language.

===Language education===
The topic of the teaching of regional languages in public primary and secondary schools is controversial. Proponents of the measure state that it would be necessary for the preservation of those languages and to show respect to the local culture. Opponents contend that local languages are often non-standardised (thus making curricula difficult), of dubious practical usefulness (since most are spoken by a small number of people, without any sizable corpus of publications) and that the curriculum and funding of public schools are already too strained. The topic also leads to wider controversial questions of autonomy of the &quot;régions&quot;. Regarding other languages, English, Spanish, Italian and German are the most commonly studied foreign languages in French schools.

In April 2001, the Minister of Education, Jack Lang, stated formally that &quot;Depuis plus de deux siècles, les pouvoirs politiques ont combattu les langues régionales&quot;, ie for more than two centuries, the political powers of the French government had repressed regional languages, and announced that bilingual education would, for the first time, be recognised, and bilingual teachers recruited in French public schools.

===Cross-border languages===
Some of the languages of France are also cross-border languages (for example, Basque, Catalan, Corsican, Dutch, Franc-Comtois, Franco-Provençal, Norman, Picard, Occitan and others), some of which enjoy a recognised or official status in the respective neighbouring state or territory. French itself is also a cross-border language, being spoken in neighbouring Andorra, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, and Switzerland.

==List of languages==
According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried in France by the Insee and based on a sample of 15,350 people, French was the mother tongue of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). People who spoke other languages natively made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.

==Statistics==
=== INSEE 1999 ===
At the 1999 census, INSEE sampled 380,000 adult people all across Metropolitan France, and asked them questions about their family situation. One of the questions was about the languages that their parents spoke with them before the age of five. This is the first time serious statistics were computed about the proportion of mother tongues in France. The results were published in &quot;Enquête familiale, Insee, 1999&quot;.

Here is a list of the nine most prominent mother tongues in France based on &quot;Enquête familiale&quot;. 
When the people with mother tongue and people with some exposure to the language before the age of five (see note #3 below) are added together, the five most widely spoken languages in metropolitan France are (note that the percentages add up to more than 100, because many bilingual people are now counted twice):

* French: 42,100,000 (92%)
* Occitan: 1,670,000 (3.65%)
* German and German dialects: 1,440,000 (3.15%)
* Oïl languages (excl. French): 1,420,000 (3.10%)
* Arabic: 1,170,000 (2.55%)

==== Notes on the table ====
# The data in the table are about mother tongues, and not about actual language practice. It states that 14% of the adult people living in France in 1999 were born and raised up to the age of 5 in families that spoke only (or predominantly) some other languages than French. It does not mean that 14% of adult people in France spoke some other languages than French in 1999.
# Only adults (i.e. 18 years and older) were surveyed. This means that French people born between 1981 and 1999 are not included in the survey. The mother tongue of the younger generations is more predominantly French than is the case with the older generations because, as the &quot;Enquête familiale&quot; survey explains, regional and immigrant language transmission decreases dramatically with each new generation, as French replaces the regional and immigrant languages. In the &quot;Enquête familiale&quot; survey, only 35% of parents whose mother tongue was a regional or immigrant language reported that they spoke that language to their children. Thus, the 86% figure of people with French as their mother tongue is an underestimate because the younger generations whose predominant mother tongue is French are not counted.
# The concept of &quot;mother tongue&quot; may not give a complete idea of the phenomenon of minority languages in France. This is because there are many people who were born and raised in families in which parents spoke to them only (or predominantly) French, but in which some regional or immigration languages were also occasionally used. One example: while the data shows that 610,000 adults in 1999 had one of the Occitan dialects as their mother tongue, the survey also found out that another 1,060,000 adults were born and raised in families in which one of the Occitan dialects was occasionally spoken. Some of these 1,060,000 people may speak Occitan as fluently as the 610,000 people who have it as a mother tongue, while some other (the majority, probably) have only a limited knowledge of Occitan. That 1,670,000 adults are speakers of Occitan cannot be corroborated, but it may be the case that the total number of people with some form of exposure to Occitan is higher than the 610,000 figure, though some of may have stopped using the language altogether since then.

=== &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, Metropolitan France ===
The following languages are listed as having 50,000 or more total speakers in Metropolitan France according to the 2022 edition of &quot;Ethnologue&quot;. Entries identified by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; as macrolanguages (such as Arabic, Persian, Malay, Pashto, and Chinese, encompassing all their respective varieties) are not included in this section.

<text>St Matthias Old Church is the modern name given to the Poplar Chapel built by the East India Company in 1654, in Poplar. The church is designated a Grade II* listed building.

St Matthias Old Church is one of the very few extant churches built under the Commonwealth (others include those at Berwick-on-Tweed, Staunton Harold, Ninekirks and Brougham.)

==History==
In 1627 the East India Company (EIC) purchased a house in Poplar High Street to be used as a hospital for disabled seamen. In 1618 a corrupt jeweller, Hugh Greete, had been sent back from India for stealing stones. He died in prison in 1619, and directed that a school or hospital be founded from his estate. The Company had set up a shipyard in Blackwall in 1614, so neighbouring Poplar was the obvious choice for location. In 1633 the inhabitants of Poplar and Blackwall – largely employees of the EIC – requested that a chapel be built there as St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney was too far away for them. When Gilbert Dethick, the Lord of the Manor of Poplar, died in 1639 he left a further £100 towards the building of the chapel, on the condition that work started within three years of his death.

The beginning of the work coincided with the outbreak of the English Civil War. William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury was executed in 1645 after being prominently involved in debates about church architecture and internal décor. With a further bequest from Sir John Gayer, a director of the EIC, and money direct from the Company, work got properly underway in 1652. The first payment was made to John Tanner, Master of the Bricklayers&#x27; Company in 1654, who became the principal builder. 

The burial ground was allotted to the chapel in 1657.

==Architecture==
St Matthias is a brick building enhanced with stone quoins at the corners. It combines Classical and Gothic elements, similar to St Katherine Cree in the City of London, consecrated in 1631.

Internally, the barrel-vaulted roof is supported by eight Tuscan columns, seven of oak and one of stone. There is no evidence to support the story that they were made from ships&#x27; masts. This gives a Dutch flavour to the architecture reminiscent of Hendrick de Keyser who built several churches in Amsterdam in the early seventeenth century.

During the eighteenth century various changes were made: a tower added (1718), a triple-decker pulpit (1733) and extensive repairs and alterations to the windows in 1775–1776 (architect: Richard Jupp). In the early 19th century a mural monument to George Steevens by John Flaxman was commissioned; this is currently on loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

==Usage==

For many years the Chapel was used for prayers before mariners and passengers departed on what might prove to be a dangerous voyage. Many early migrants to British North America would have participated in these services, before leaving for an uncertain future abroad. It was also the chapel of the adjacent almshouses, home to the Poplar Pensioners, seamen retired from the EIC. Officers had premises up by the East India Dock Road, whereas the other ranks were located on Poplar High Street. Between 1841 and 1844 eight Asiatic sailors were buried in the churchyard.

Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the EIC was wound up and Poplar Chapel became St Matthias, a Church of England parish church. Its first vicar was John Fenwick Kitto, appointed by Archibald Campbell Tait. William Milford Teulon carried out substantial changes from 1867 to 1876: a modern pulpit, font and organ were installed, the building was clad in Kentish ragstone and a chancel, vestry and organ chamber were installed. Stained glass windows incorporating masonic imagery were installed in 1920 by East London lodges as a memorial to their brethren who had died in the First World War. Poplar was heavily bombed during the Second World War, but St Matthias survived with only shards of shrapnel buried in some of the walls.

However, in the 1970s St Matthias merged with St Anne&#x27;s, Limehouse; St Matthias was thriving but St Anne&#x27;s, with much smaller congregations, was architecturally too prestigious to close. So the two churches joined, and the congregation of St Matthias moved to Limehouse. St Matthias&#x27; building was declared redundant in 1977 and deconsecrated. After several years of dereliction, English Heritage and the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) agreed to major restoration in 1990, with the agreed use being as an &quot;Arts Centre&quot;. As the LDDC did not have the funding to match English Heritage, LDDC decided that its contribution should be part of the necessary &#x27;Planning Gain&#x27; required for the West India Quay site, which they were in the process of selling. The UK agents of the overseas purchaser, Cheval, refused to accept the &#x27;Arts Centre&#x27; and demanded local involvement in determining future use as well as the establishment of a &quot;sinking fund&quot; to maintain St Matthias in perpetuity. In 1992 the St Matthias Conservation trust was set up to preserve the building and provide use as a community centre.

<text>Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. Manufacturing Division (originally, Diamond-Star Motors) was an automobile-manufacturing joint venture between the Chrysler Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors. The name came from the parent companies&#x27; respective logos: three &quot;diamonds&quot; (Mitsubishi) and a penta&quot;star&quot; (Chrysler). 

Diamond-Star Motors was officially renamed &quot;Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, Inc.&quot; (MMMA) in 1995, four years after Mitsubishi took sole control of the plant, and from 2002 to 2016 its official name had been &quot;Mitsubishi Motors North America&quot;, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;Manufacturing Division&quot;.

In the automotive enthusiast community, &quot;DSM&quot;, especially used in the singular (e.g. &quot;a DSM&quot;) generally refers to the original first- and second-generation Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle Talon, and Plymouth Laser, which all shared the same Diamond-Star Motors vehicle platform.

== History ==

===Background===
The origins of Diamond-Star Motors can be traced back to 1970 when Chrysler took a 15 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors, as part of MMC&#x27;s strategy of expansion through alliances with foreign partners. The U.S. company began distributing Mitsubishis as Chrysler-, Dodge-, and Plymouth-branded captive imports (e.g. Dodge Colt), a successful venture as the compact cars met consumer demand for smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicles in the 1970s, filling a gap at the bottom of the Chrysler group&#x27;s range.

By 1982, Chrysler was importing 110,000 Mitsubishis annually. However, a minor conflict was forming as the Japanese now wanted to sell directly through their own-branded dealerships. A voluntary import quota system was in place at this time, restricting the number of cars Japanese automakers could bring into the U.S. As the Japanese company began to open its own branded dealerships to sell directly, every imported Cordia, Tredia, and Starion sold by Mitsubishi had to be discounted from Chrysler&#x27;s allocation. Another point of contention was that Chrysler had the right of first refusal of any Mitsubishi automobiles in the US market until 1990.

=== Incorporation ===

In order to circumvent this, the two partners officially incorporated Diamond-Star Motors in October 1985. An incentive package worth US$274 million, and an intense and controversial lobbying effort by state and local government authorities, meant that Illinois won the new auto plant, and in April 1986 ground was broken on a production facility in the town of Normal. The plant was completed in March 1988, with an annual capacity of 240,000 vehicles. In 1989, the workers at the plant formed United Auto Workers Local 2488, and signed their first contract with the company.
Initially, three models were produced at this facility. The Mitsubishi Eclipse, Plymouth Laser, and Eagle Talon were smaller 2+2 sports cars on a new co-designed platform. Models subsequently produced during the next decade included the Mitsubishi Mirage/Dodge/Plymouth Colt/Eagle Summit sedans, the Mitsubishi Galant, the Dodge Avenger Coupe/Chrysler Sebring Coupe, and the Dodge Stratus Coupe.

===Departure of Chrysler===
Initially Diamond-Star Motors was a 50-50 joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. However, in 1991 the Japanese company purchased its partner&#x27;s interest, and thereafter the manufacture of Chrysler vehicles was on a contractual basis. Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993, and Diamond-Star Motors was renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995. Despite the departure, the two companies have maintained various co-operative manufacturing agreements since and considered all vehicle produced until 1995 as Diamond Star Motors.

Formerly, the plant produced vehicles using the American-developed Mitsubishi PS platform, including the Endeavor, Galant, and Eclipse. An expansion in 2003 enlarged the plant to . In mid-2012, the plant began producing the Mitsubishi ASX which is sold in United States as the Outlander Sport. Approximately 1,900 people worked in the highly mechanized plant, alongside approximately 1,000 robots.

===Closure and sale of the plant to Rivian ===
In July 2015, Mitsubishi announced that it would end production at the plant in Normal. The plant had been operating well below capacity for several years. In 2014, it produced just over 61,000 vehicles out of a capacity of 240,000 vehicles annually. Production would shift to Japan, with Mitsubishi importing all vehicles sold in North America. Mitsubishi said it would try to sell the plant to preserve jobs, but that the plant would be closed by November if no buyer was found. Ultimately a buyer was not found in time, and production ended on the 30th of November. Most of the workers (900 out of 1200) were let go on that date, with the rest staying to build replacement parts until the final closure of the plant in May 2016. Eventually the plant was sold to Maynards Industries, an auctioning and liquidation firm, with ownership to transfer June 1, 2016.

Currently, the facility is owned by American electric vehicle startup Rivian, which in 2017 acquired the plant and its contents for $16 million.

<text>Auguste Victor Laurent Casimir-Perier (20 August 1811, in Paris – 6 June 1876) was a French diplomat and political leader. He was the son of Prime Minister Casimir Pierre Perier and the father of President Jean Casimir-Perier.

He entered the diplomatic service, being attached successively to the London, Brussels and St Petersburg embassies and in 1843 became minister plenipotentiary at Hanover.

In 1846 he resigned from the service to enter the legislature as deputy for the &quot;département&quot; of Seine, a constituency which he exchanged for another one in the &quot;département&quot; of Aube after the Revolution of 1848.

On the establishment of the Second Empire he retired temporarily from public life, and devoted himself to economic questions of which he published a series of works, notably &quot;Les Finances et la politique&quot; (1863), dealing with the interaction of political institutions and finance. He contested Grenoble unsuccessfully in 1863 against the imperial candidate, Casimir Royer; and failed again for Aube in 1869.

In 1871 he was returned by three &quot;départements&quot; to the National Assembly, and elected to sit for Aube. He joined the &quot;Centre gauche&quot; parliamentary group. He was minister of the interior for a few months from 11 October 1871 to 6 February 1872, and his retirement deprived Thiers of one of the strongest elements in his cabinet. He also joined the short-lived ministry of May 1873 (18 to 25 May). He consistently opposed all efforts in the direction of a monarchical restoration, but on the definite constitution of the republic became a senator for life, declining Mac-Mahon&#x27;s invitation to form the first cabinet under the new constitution. He died in Paris.

<doc id="441726" wikidata="Q27075897" url="?curid=441726" title="Mourning warbler">
<text>The mourning warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family. Mourning warblers are native to eastern and central North America as well as some countries in Central America. They are neotropical migrants and tend to be found in dense second growth forests. They are under the Wood-warbler category, which consists of arboreal and terrestrial colorful passerines. Wood warblers are in the order Passeriformes, which are perching birds including more than half of all bird species, and the family Parulidae which also includes the Common Yellowthroat, Black and White Warbler, Nashville Warbler, ovenbird, and American Redstart. They are very similar to the MacGillivray&#x27;s Warbler in appearance, especially in females and immature birds, but their breeding range does not overlap into the west.

The &quot;mourning&quot; in this bird&#x27;s name refers to the male&#x27;s hood, thought to resemble a mourning veil.

==Identification==
Mourning warblers are small songbird with yellow underparts, olive-green upperparts, a thin pointed bill and pink legs. Adult males have a gray hood, black lores and a black patch on the throat and breast. In the fall, this pattern becomes less bright and harder to distinguish from similar species; however they never have a broken eye ring. Females and immatures are gray-brown on the head with an incomplete eye-ring. They have a yellow-gray throat with a brown or olive tint to their breast. Both sexes can range from 10 to 15 cm (3.9-5.9 in) in length and 11–13 g (0.4–0.5 oz) in weight. Their wingspan is 18 cm (7.1 in). Other than the MacGillivray&#x27;s Warbler, similar species include the Connecticut warblers which have a complete eye ring, not to be confused with a broken eye ring seen on immature Mourning warblers. Immature Connecticut warblers also have a whiter chest compared to the yellow chest on immature Mourning warblers. Nashville warblers are also commonly confused; however they have a yellow throat unlike the black or grey throats of Mourning warblers, females have a grey back, and they are smaller and less active than Mourning warblers.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Mourning warblers have breeding ground in southern Canada, and are commonly seen during migration in the central and eastern United States, Belize, Bonaire, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Panama, and other Central American Islands. These birds migrate to Central America and northern South America. Mourning warblers are low or ground nesters, and prefer disturbed forests with a thick under-story and covered canopy. In the winter they prefer wet lowland habitat with dense vegetation.

== Behavior and ecology ==
=== Diet ===
Mourning warblers forage low in vegetation, sometimes catching insects in flight. These birds mainly eat insects, also some plant material including fruiting bodies from the Cecropia tree in winter. Their diet is not well documented but also includes insect larvae and spiders that they pick from the branches of shrubs. They are also known to remove the legs and wings of the insects before consuming.

=== Breeding ===
Mourning warblers breed in southern Canada. Their breeding habitat is thickets and semi-open areas with dense shrubs across Canada east of the Rockies and the northeastern United States. The nest is an open cup placed on the ground in a well-concealed location under thick shrubs or other vegetation. Their nest is usually made out of grass, leaves and bark and lined with roots or other thin material.

Mourning warblers typically lay 2–5 eggs, which are white or speckled brown and black in appearance. Incubation is 12 days long and both adult males and females utilize a distraction technique of pretending to have broken wings to distract predators from their nest. Mourning warblers have young with gray tufts on their head and red mouths. Adult females are also known consume their eggs after their young hatch. The number of days for young to fledge is 7–9.

=== Vocalization ===

The song of this bird is a bright repetitive warble. The warble consists of rolling phrases that sound that typically lower in volume at the end and can sound like &quot;chirry, chirry, chirry, chorry, chorry.&quot; The call is a sharp &quot;chip&quot;. There are usually two different pitched calls, with one higher than the harsh chip.

== Conservation ==
According to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, Mourning Warbler populations have declined by about 43% in the last 50 years. However, they are still categorized as a species of least concern with 17 million estimated as a global breeding population by Partners in Flight. As they have a preference for disturbed forests, they may be benefitting from human development that may be negatively effecting the habitats of other bird species.

<text>Frances Elena Farmer (September 19, 1913August 1, 1970) was an American actress. She appeared in over a dozen feature films over the course of her career, though she garnered notoriety for sensationalized accounts of her life, especially her involuntary commitment to psychiatric hospitals and subsequent mental health struggles.

A native of Seattle, Washington, Farmer began acting in stage productions while a student at the University of Washington. After graduating, she began performing in stock theater before signing a film contract with Paramount Pictures on her 22nd birthday in September 1935. She made her film debut in the B film &quot;Too Many Parents&quot; (1936), followed by another B picture, &quot;Border Flight&quot;, before being given the lead role opposite Bing Crosby in the musical Western &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; (1936). Unhappy with the opportunities the studio gave her, Farmer returned to stock theater in 1937 before being cast in the original Broadway production of Clifford Odets&#x27;s &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, staged by New York City&#x27;s Group Theatre. She followed this with two Broadway productions directed by Elia Kazan in 1939, but a battle with depression and binge drinking caused her to drop out of a subsequent Ernest Hemingway stage adaptation.

Farmer returned to Los Angeles, earning supporting roles in the comedy &quot;World Premiere&quot; (1941) and the film noir &quot;Among the Living&quot; (1941). In 1942, publicity of her reportedly erratic behavior began to surface, and after several arrests and committals to psychiatric institutions, Farmer was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. At the request of her family, particularly her mother, she was committed to an institution in her home state of Washington, where she remained a patient until 1950. Farmer attempted an acting comeback, mainly appearing as a television host in Indianapolis on her own series, &quot;Frances Farmer Presents&quot;. Her final film role was in the 1958 drama &quot;The Party Crashers&quot;, after which she spent the majority of the 1960s occasionally performing in local theater productions staged by Purdue University. In the spring of 1970, she was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, from which she died on August 1, 1970, aged 56.

Farmer has been the subject of two feature films and several books focusing on her time spent institutionalized, during which she claimed to have been subjected to systematic abuse. Her posthumously released, ghostwritten, and widely discredited autobiography, &quot;Will There Really Be a Morning?&quot; (1972), details these claims, but has been exposed as a largely fictional work by a friend of Farmer&#x27;s to clear debts. Another discredited 1978 biography of her life, &quot;Shadowland&quot;, alleged that Farmer underwent a transorbital lobotomy during her institutionalization, but the author has since stated in court that he fabricated this incident and several other aspects of the book. A 1982 biographical film based on this book depicted these events as true, resulting in renewed interest in her life and career.

==Life and career==
===1913–1935: Early life===
Frances Elena Farmer was born on September 19, 1913, in Seattle, Washington, the daughter of Cora Lillian (née Van Ornum; 18731955), a boardinghouse operator and dietician and Ernest Melvin Farmer (18741956), a lawyer. Her father was originally from Spring Valley, Minnesota, while her mother was from Oregon and a descendant of pioneers. Lillian&#x27;s maternal grandparents were John and Jemima (Skews) Rowe, who came to Waldwick, Wisconsin, from Truro, England, in 1849. Farmer had an older sister, Edith; an older brother, Wesley; and an older half-sister, Rita, conceived during her mother&#x27;s first marriage. Before the birth of Wesley and Edith, Lillian had given birth to a daughter who died of pneumonia in infancy. When she was four years old, Farmer&#x27;s parents separated, and her mother moved with the children to Los Angeles, where her sister Zella lived. In early 1925, the family moved north to Chico, California, where Lillian pursued a career in nutrition research. Shortly after arriving in Chico, Lillian concluded that caring for the children was interfering with her ability to work. The children&#x27;s Aunt Zella then drove them to Albany, Oregon, where they boarded a train back to Seattle to live with their father.
Farmer&#x27;s inconsistent home life had a notable effect on her, and upon returning to Seattle, she recalled: &quot;In certain ways, that train trip represented the end of my dependent childhood. I began to understand that there were certain things one could expect from adults, and others that one could not expect...being shunted from one household to another was a new adjustment, a fresh confusion, and I groped for ways to compensate for the disorder.&quot; The next year, her mother returned to Seattle after her home in Chico burned down. In Seattle, the family shared a household, but Lillian and Ernest remained separated despite his attempts to repair their marriage. In the fall of 1929, when Farmer was 16, Lillian and Ernest divorced, and Lillian moved to a cottage in Bremerton, Washington, while the children remained with their father.

In 1931, while a senior at West Seattle High School, Farmer entered and won $100 from The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards, a writing contest sponsored by &quot;Scholastic Magazine&quot;, with her controversial essay &quot;God Dies&quot;. It was a precocious attempt to reconcile her wish for, in her words, a &quot;superfather&quot; God, with her observations of a chaotic and godless world. In her autobiography, she wrote that the essay was influenced by her reading of Friedrich Nietzsche: &quot;He expressed the same doubts, only he said it in German: &quot;Gott ist tot&quot;. God is dead. This I could understand. I was not to assume that there was no God, but I could find no evidence in my life that He existed or that He had ever shown any particular interest in me. I was not an atheist, but I was surely an agnostic, and by the time I was 16, I was well indoctrinated into this theory.&quot;

After graduating from high school, Farmer enrolled at the University of Washington, initially majoring in journalism. She worked various jobs to pay her tuition, including as an usherette in a cinema, a waitress, a tutor, a laborer in a soap factory, and a singing waitress at Mount Rainier National Park. During her sophomore year, Farmer became involved with the university&#x27;s drama department productions. She starred in numerous UW plays, including &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;, &quot;Everyman&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. In late 1934, she starred in UW&#x27;s production of &quot;Alien Corn&quot;, which earned her favorable reviews in local press.

During her final year of college in 1935, Farmer won a subscription contest for the leftist newspaper &quot;The Voice of Action&quot;. The first prize was a trip to the Soviet Union. Farmer accepted the prize, despite her mother&#x27;s strong objections, so that she could see the pioneering Moscow Art Theatre. Her interest in such topics fostered speculations that she was not only an atheist, but also a Communist. The same year, she graduated from the university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama.

=== 1935–1936: Early films and rise to fame ===

Returning from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1935, Farmer stopped in New York City, hoping to launch a theater career. There, she met talent agent Shepard Traube (1907–1983), who referred her to Paramount Pictures talent scout Oscar Serlin, who arranged for a screen test. Paramount offered her a seven-year contract, which Farmer signed in New York City on her 22nd birthday. After completing screen tests on Long Island, Farmer moved to Los Angeles to begin working for Paramount. Upon arrival, she underwent dental surgery to fix a gap in her front teeth, and she spent long hours screen-testing and training on the Paramount studio lot. In November 1935, she was cast in the B-movie &quot;Too Many Parents&quot; (1936), a comedy about young men in military school. The film was a box-office success. After completing it in February 1936, Farmer wed fellow Paramount contract player Wycliffe Anderson (who had changed his name to William Anderson, and later to Glenn Erickson, and finally to Leif Erickson, after the Viking explorer). She was then cast in a lead role in the drama &quot;Border Flight&quot;.

Later that year, Farmer was cast in her first &quot;A&quot; feature, &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot;, a Western starring Bing Crosby. She recalled of the film: &quot;I had had a crush on him [Crosby] since my high school days, and stood in awe of the fact that in my first important film I was actually working as his leading lady.&quot; &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; earned favorable reviews and brought Farmer an enhanced public reputation. After its release, Paramount studio head Adolph Zukor phoned her and told her, &quot;now that she was a rising star she&#x27;d have to start acting like one.&quot; Farmer was resistant, however, and spent most of her time at her home in Laurel Canyon with Erickson, forgoing invitations to Hollywood parties and events. In an attempt to make her marketable, Paramount chose to brand her in press releases as &quot;the star who would not go Hollywood,&quot; focusing on her &quot;eccentric&quot; fashion tastes.

During the summer of 1936, she was lent to Samuel Goldwyn to appear in &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, based on the novel by Edna Ferber, in which she portrayed a young woman pursued by her mother&#x27;s former lover. Howard Hawks was originally signed to direct, but was replaced by William Wyler midway through production; Farmer was indignant and clashed with Wyler during filming. He later said, &quot;The nicest thing I can say about Frances Farmer is that she is unbearable.&quot; Though her working relationship with Wyler was tumultuous, Hawks remembered Farmer with admiration, saying that she &quot;had more talent than anyone I ever worked with.&quot; Producers chose to premiere the film in Seattle, Farmer&#x27;s hometown. At the premiere, Farmer was notably quiet and spoke little to reporters, which resulted in news reports that she was cold and aloof. Nevertheless, &quot;Come and Get It&quot; earned praise from the public and critics, with several reviews greeting Farmer as a newfound star, some likening her to Greta Garbo.

In 1937, she was lent to RKO to star opposite Cary Grant in &quot;The Toast of New York&quot;, the story of a Wall Street tycoon. The film&#x27;s production was turbulent as Farmer was unhappy with the rebranding of her character from a hard-edged vixen to &quot;an ingénue fresh from Sunnybrook.&quot; On set, she argued with director Rowland V. Lee and gave belittling interviews to the press. Unsatisfied with her career direction after &quot;The Toast of New York&quot;, Farmer resisted the studio&#x27;s control and every attempt it made to glamorize her private life. A 1937 &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; article, though, sympathetically described her as indifferent to the clothing she wore and said she drove an older-model &quot;green roadster&quot;. Also in 1937, she appeared in the crime drama &quot;Exclusive&quot; opposite Fred MacMurray and the Technicolor adventure film &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; opposite Ray Milland.

===1937–1941: Transition to theater===

Unsatisfied with the expectations of the studio system and wanting to enhance her reputation as a serious actress, Farmer left Hollywood in mid-1937 to do summer stock on the East Coast, performing in Westchester, New York, and Westport, Connecticut. There, she attracted the attention of director Harold Clurman and playwright Clifford Odets, who invited her to appear in a three-month production of Odets&#x27; play &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, produced by the Group Theatre. The play opened in November 1937 and ran for a total of 248 performances. Her performance at first received mixed reviews, with &quot;Time&quot; commenting that she had been miscast. Due to Farmer&#x27;s box-office appeal, however, the play became the biggest hit in the group&#x27;s history. By 1938, when the production had embarked on a national tour, regional critics from Washington, DC, to Chicago gave her rave reviews.
During the run of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, Farmer began a romantic affair with Odets, but he was married to actress Luise Rainer and did not offer Farmer a commitment. Farmer felt betrayed when Odets suddenly ended the relationship, and when the group chose another actress for its London runan actress whose family helped secure funds for the playshe came to believe that the group had used her drawing power selfishly to further the success of the play. Disheartened, Farmer returned to Los Angeles to star opposite husband Erickson in &quot;Ride a Crooked Mile&quot; (1938). In April 1939, she performed in a short-run Broadway production of &quot;Quiet City&quot;, an experimental play directed by Elia Kazan. In November that year, she returned to Broadway, portraying Melanie in &quot;Thunder Rock&quot;, also directed by Kazan, and produced by the Group Theater. The play was not well received, and Farmer was profoundly unhappy after its closing in December 1939. She subsequently accepted a role in a Broadway adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Column&quot;, for which she was scheduled to begin rehearsing in early 1940. During rehearsals, Farmer began binge drinking in an effort to alleviate her depression. She ultimately chose to withdraw from the production, resulting in a $1,500 fine from the Theater Guild, for &quot;unprofessionalism&quot;.

She returned to Paramount, which assigned her a role in &quot;South of Pago Pago&quot; (1940), in which she portrayed Ruby, a woman traveling with a group of adventurers searching for pearls on an island. She was then lent to Warner Bros. to star in &quot;Flowing Gold&quot;, an adventure drama set against the oil industry, opposite John Garfield. After completing the film, Farmer returned to the East Coast to appear in summer-stock theater. Following a &quot;lonely winter&quot; spent living in New York City, Farmer drove back to Los Angeles in the spring of 1941, and rented a lavish mansion in Santa Monica. Her next film was &quot;World Premiere&quot; (1941), a comedy starring John Barrymore. She followed this with a supporting part in the film noir &quot;Among the Living&quot; (1941), co-starring with Susan Hayward and Albert Dekker.

During this time, Farmer was &quot;seeking in work a respite from her personal struggles.&quot; Clurman temporarily moved into her Santa Monica home to keep her company while she completed filming of &quot;Badlands of Dakota&quot;, a Western in which she starred as Calamity Jane opposite Robert Stack. Farmer again fought with the studio over the role, which she felt was over-glamorized, further damaging her reputation with studio executives. She next appeared opposite Tyrone Power and Roddy McDowall in the film &quot;Son of Fury&quot; (1942) (on loan to 20th Century Fox), portraying the scheming daughter of a British aristocrat. Later that year, Paramount suspended her after she refused to accept a part in the film &quot;Take a Letter, Darling&quot; and voided her contract. Meanwhile, her marriage to Erickson had disintegrated, and he began dating actress Margaret Hayes. Their divorce was finalized on June 12, 1942, and Erickson married Hayes the same day.

===1942–1949: Legal troubles and psychiatric confinement===
On October 19, 1942, Farmer was stopped by Santa Monica police for driving with her headlights on high beam in the wartime blackout zone that affected most of the West Coast. Some reports stated she was unable to produce a driver&#x27;s license, and was verbally abusive to the officers. The police suspected her of being drunk and she was jailed overnight. Farmer was fined $500 and given a 180-day suspended sentence. She immediately paid $250 and was put on probation. With her vehicle impounded and her driver&#x27;s license suspended, Farmer holed up in her Santa Monica home and denied the press interviews.
In November 1942, her agent secured her a role in an independent film adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Murder at Laudice&quot;, which was set to film in Mexico City. Upon arriving in Mexico, she discovered that the shooting script was unfinished, and the production never reached fruition. While in Mexico City, Farmer was allegedly charged with drunk and disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace, and was forced by authorities to return to the United States. Upon returning to California, she found her Santa Monica home cleared of her possessions and inhabited by a strange family. Farmer later contended that her mother and sister-in-law had stripped the house and stored her belongings while she was gone. Her mother rented her a room at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Hollywood, where she temporarily took residence.

By January 1943, Farmer had failed to pay the remainder of her fine, and a bench warrant was issued for her arrest. At almost the same time, a studio hairdresser filed an assault charge alleging that Farmer had hit her in the face and dislocated her jaw on set. On January 13, 1943, police went to the Knickerbocker to arrest her, but she did not surrender peacefully. 

At her hearing the following morning, Farmer behaved erratically. She claimed the police had violated her rights; demanded an attorney; and threw an inkwell at the judge. When asked about her drinking habits, Farmer told the judge: &quot;I put liquor in my milk... in my coffee and in my orange juice.&quot; She also admitted to regularly drinking benzedrine. The judge sentenced her to 180 days in jail. While being taken from the courtroom, Farmer knocked down a policeman and bruised another, along with a matron; she ran to a phone booth where she tried to call her attorney, but was subdued by the police. When they physically carried her away, she shouted: &quot;Have you ever had a broken heart?&quot;

Through the efforts of her sister-in-law, a deputy sheriff in Los Angeles County, Farmer avoided jail time and was instead transferred to the psychiatric ward of Los Angeles General Hospital on January 21. There, she was diagnosed with &quot;manic depressive psychosis, probably the forerunner of a definite dementia praecox.&quot; Days later, with assistance from the Screen Actors Guild, she was transferred to the Kimball Sanitarium, a minimum-security psychiatric institute in the San Fernando Valley. Psychiatrists there diagnosed her with paranoid schizophrenia. She was administered insulin shock therapy, then a standard psychiatric procedure, whose side effects included intense nausea. Her family later claimed they did not consent to the treatment, as documented in her sister&#x27;s self-published book, &quot;Look Back in Love&quot;, and in court records; Farmer herself later alleged that she was given insulin treatments for 90 consecutive days. After nine months at the Kimball Sanitarium, Farmer walked out of the institute one afternoon and traveled to her half-sister Rita&#x27;s house, over away. They called their mother in Seattle to complain about the insulin treatments.
Lillian traveled to California and began a lengthy legal battle to take formal guardianship of Frances from the state of California. Although several psychiatrists testified that Farmer needed further treatment, her mother prevailed. The two of them left Los Angeles by train on September 13, 1943. Farmer moved in with her parents in West Seattle, but her mother and she fought bitterly. Farmer wrote in her autobiography: &quot;Mamma and I had fought, argued, threatened, and screamed until it had finally come down to a climax of two exhausted women sitting across from each other in a small, cluttered kitchen. We were enemies who had grown tired of pretending.&quot; After one violent physical attack, Lillian had Farmer committed to Western State Hospital at Steilacoom, Washington. In a 1958 television interview by Ralph Edwards on his &quot;This is Your Life&quot; program, Frances recalled her experience:

Three months later, in early July 1944, she was pronounced &quot;completely cured&quot; and released. Shortly after her release, on July 15, Farmer was arrested for vagrancy in Antioch, California.

In January 1945, Farmer&#x27;s father took her to stay at her aunt&#x27;s ranch in Yerington, Nevada. During her stay, Farmer ran away from the residence. She was discovered several days later at a movie theater in Reno, and returned by police to her aunt&#x27;s home. Several months later, on May 18, 1945, Lillian filed for a sanity hearing for Farmer after she ran away from their home in Seattle. The hearing was held on May 21, during which the court ruled that Farmer was to be recommitted to Western State Hospital. She remained an inmate of the hospital for the next five years, with the exception of a brief parole in 1946. Throughout her internment, Farmer remained in the high-security ward for the hospital&#x27;s &quot;violent&quot; patients. Her treatment at Western State was subject to significant public and critical discussion in the years after her death.

===1950–1958: Post-hospitalization and comeback attempt===
On March 23, 1950, at her parents&#x27; request, Farmer was paroled back into her mother&#x27;s care. A year later, on March 25, 1951, Farmer was formally discharged from the jurisdiction of Western State, but was not made aware of it for two years; in the interim, she believed her recommitment to the hospital an imminent threat. In June 1953, upon discovering her discharge, Farmer requested that her mother&#x27;s conservatorship be lifted, which the Superior Court did. With her freedom restored, Farmer took a job sorting laundry at the Olympic Hotel in Seattle, the same hotel where she had been fêted in 1936 at &quot;Come and Get It&quot;&#x27;s premiere. While working at the Olympic Hotel, a co-worker set Farmer up on a blind date with Alfred H. Lobley, a 45-year-old city utility worker. The two married in April 1954, and moved in with Lillian, who was growing senile and needed assistance at home. Within the year, Lillian was sent to a nursing home, after which Farmer&#x27;s marriage to Lobley began to disintegrate.

Farmer remained estranged from her sister until Lillian&#x27;s death from a stroke in March 1955. After their mother&#x27;s death, Farmer&#x27;s sister Edith moved to Portland, Oregon, to be nearer to their father, who died there on July 15, 1956, also of a stroke. During this time, Farmer and Edith occasionally corresponded. Edith claimed that on one occasion, Farmer visited her in Portland, where the two spent an afternoon at The Grotto, a Catholic sanctuary they had once visited with their father.
In late 1957, Farmer separated from Lobley and relocated to Eureka, California, where she found work as a bookkeeper and secretary at a commercial photo studio. In Eureka, she met Leland C. Mikesell, an independent broadcast promoter from Indianapolis, who recognized her at a local bar. The two soon became romantically involved, and Mikesell envisioned a career comeback for her. They moved to San Francisco, where Farmer temporarily worked as a clerk at the Park Sheraton Hotel. In 1958, Mikesell and she married.

In a December 1957 interview with &quot;Modern Screen&quot;, Farmer said: &quot;I blame nobody for my fall. I had to face agonizing decisions when I was younger. The decisions broke me. But, too, there was a lack of philosophy in my life. With faith in myself and in God I think I have won the fight to control myself.&quot; She subsequently made two appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, during one of which she played guitar and sang &quot;Aura Lee&quot;, a folk song she had performed in &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (1936). She also appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in an attempt to clarify the veracity of the publicity she had received throughout her career. Farmer explained to &quot;This is Your Life&quot;&#x27;s host, Ralph Edwards:

Edwards later asked Farmer about her supposed alcoholism: &quot;Other stories accuse you of being an alcoholic. Were you, Frances?&quot; Farmer&#x27;s reply was, &quot;No, I was never an alcoholic&quot;, an adamant denial that also applied to Edwards&#x27;s subsequent question about &quot;dope&quot;.

In August 1957, Farmer returned to the stage in New Hope, Pennsylvania, for a summer-stock production of Enid Bagnold&#x27;s &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot;. Through the spring of 1958, Farmer appeared in several live television dramas, some of which are preserved on kinescope; the same year, she made her last film, &quot;The Party Crashers&quot;, a potboiler drama produced by Paramount and described by one writer as &quot;a crappy B-movie about wild teenagers and stupid adults.&quot; Then, in July 1958, Farmer accepted the lead role in a production of &quot;Yes, My Darling Daughter&quot;, due to the reciprocal arrangements that existed between one of the summer-stock East Coast theaters in which she performed and venues in the Midwest; this particular role was based at a theater in Indianapolis.

===1959–1964: Stage and television work===
Farmer&#x27;s stage work proved beneficial, as she received the opportunity to host her own daytime movie program, &quot;Frances Farmer Presents.&quot; The show was created after a television executive from the local National Broadcasting Company (NBC) affiliate, WFBM-TV (now known as WRTV), saw her performance in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; in August 1958. The program made her popular as an amiable host, and she subsequently received an award as a local businesswoman of the year. By March 1959, though, national wire service reports indicated that she had separated from Mikesell and that he was suing her for breach of contract. In 1959, Farmer moved in with Jeanira &quot;Jean&quot; Ratcliffe, a widow with whom she became good friends in Indianapolis.

In 1962, Farmer appeared in a Purdue University production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;. The following year, her divorce from Mikesell was finalized in Indianapolis. &quot;Frances Farmer Presents&quot; ended in the summer of 1964; the station&#x27;s general manager had fired her in April, hired her back two months later, but then dismissed Farmer permanently in late August/early September, aggravated by her alleged drinking binges. Farmer continued her stage work and accepted a role in a Purdue Summer Theatre production of Ketti Frings&#x27;s &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;. In 1965, she played Claire Zachanassian in Purdue&#x27;s production of Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;The Visit&quot;, which ran at the Loeb Playhouse on campus from October 22 to 30, 1965. The production has been described as follows:

During the production of &quot;The Visit&quot;, Farmer was involved in a drunk-driving crash. When confronted by police, she recalled: &quot;Rather than answering as Frances Farmer, I reverted to my role in the play and [suddenly became] the richest woman in the world, shouting to high heaven that I would buy his goddamned town. I got out stiff-legged and ivory-handed, quoting all the imperious lines I could remember. Unfortunately, this did not [sit] well with the [cop], and a patrol car took me to jail.&quot; Ironically, following reports of the incident in the media, the next night&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Visit&quot; completely sold out. Farmer was very reluctant to return to the stage, but was encouraged by Ratcliffe; Farmer recounted the experience of the performance in her autobiography: &quot;[T]here was a long silent pause as I stood there, followed by the most thunderous applause of my career. [The audience] swept the scandal under the rug with their ovation.&quot; It was &quot;my finest and final performance. I knew I would never need to act onstage again. I felt satisfied and rewarded.&quot;

===1965–1970: Final years===
During the early and mid-1960s, Farmer was actress-in-residence at Purdue University, and spent the majority of her free time painting and writing poetry. She and Ratcliffe attempted to start a small cosmetics company, but although their products were successfully field-tested, the project failed after the man who handled their investment portfolio embezzled their funds. In 1968, she formally converted to Roman Catholicism, as she claimed to have felt God in her life and sensed that she &quot;would have to find a disciplined avenue of faith and worship.&quot; She recounted her experience: Farmer had a great affection for the Saint Joan of Arc church and attended Mass there regularly in her last years. During this period, she also gave up drinking, and began considering writing an autobiography. She negotiated a collaboration with Lois Kibbee, who encouraged her to tape-record her life story. The experience was emotionally jarring for Farmer, specifically the revisiting of medical records from her institutionalization. The book went unfinished, but Ratcliffe used its manuscript in compiling Farmer&#x27;s posthumously released autobiography, &quot;Will There Really Be a Morning?&quot;.

==Death==
In the spring of 1970, Farmer was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which was attributed to a life of heavy smoking. She was hospitalized for three weeks before being sent home for a brief period. She died of the cancer at Indianapolis Community Hospital on August 1, 1970. She is interred at Oaklawn Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Fishers, Indiana.

==Posthumous controversies==
===Allegations of psychiatric mistreatment===

In the years after Farmer&#x27;s death, her treatment at Western State was the subject of serious discussion and speculation. Kenneth Anger included a chapter relating her breakdown in his 1965 work &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;. Farmer&#x27;s posthumously published autobiography &quot;Will There Really Be a Morning?&quot; described a brutal incarceration. In the book, Farmer claimed she had been brutalized and mistreated in numerous ways. Some of the claims included being forced to eat her own feces and act as a sex slave for male doctors and orderlies. Farmer recounted her stay in the state asylum as &quot;unbearable terror&quot;: &quot;I was raped by orderlies, gnawed on by rats, and poisoned by tainted food. I was chained in padded cells, strapped into strait-jackets and half-drowned in ice baths.&quot;

Jean Ratcliffe, a close friend and companion of Farmer, arranged the publication of &quot;Will There Really Be a Morning?&quot;. Controversy exists over what portions of the book she edited or ghostwrote. Ratcliffe claimed she wrote only the final chapter about Farmer&#x27;s death.

===Lobotomy claims===
In 1978, Seattle film reviewer William Arnold published &quot;Shadowland&quot;, which for the first time alleged that Farmer had been the subject of a transorbital lobotomy. Scenes of Farmer being subjected to this lobotomy procedure were featured in the 1982 film &quot;Frances&quot;, which had initially been planned as an adaptation of &quot;Shadowland&quot;, though its producers ultimately reneged on their agreement with Arnold. During a court case against the film&#x27;s producers, Brooksfilms, Arnold revealed that the lobotomy episode and much of his biography was &quot;fictionalized&quot;. Years later, on a DVD commentary track of the movie, director Graeme Clifford said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to nickel-and-dime people to death with facts.&quot;

Farmer&#x27;s family, former lovers, and three ex-husbands all denied, or did not confirm, that the procedure took place. Farmer&#x27;s sister, Edith, said the hospital asked her parents&#x27; permission to perform the lobotomy, but her father was &quot;horrified&quot; by the notion and threatened legal action &quot;if they tried any of their guinea-pig operations on her.&quot; Western State recorded all of the 300 lobotomies performed during Farmer&#x27;s time there; no evidence has been found that Farmer received one. In 1983, Seattle newspapers interviewed former hospital staff members, including all the lobotomy ward nurses who were on duty during Farmer&#x27;s years at Western State, and they all said she was never a patient on that ward. Dr. Walter Freeman&#x27;s private records contained no mention of Farmer. Charles Jones, a psychiatric resident at Western State during Farmer&#x27;s stays, also said that Farmer never had a lobotomy.

Writer Jeffrey Kauffmann published an extensive online essay, &quot;Shedding Light on &quot;Shadowland&quot;&quot;, that debunks much of Arnold&#x27;s book, including the account of the lobotomy.

==In popular culture==
In 1982, Jessica Lange portrayed Farmer in the feature film &quot;Frances&quot;; the film depicts Farmer undergoing a lobotomy, the veracity of which has been disputed. The next year, a television adaptation of &quot;Will There Really Be a Morning?&quot; was released with Susan Blakely as Farmer. Another feature film based on her life, &quot;Committed&quot;, was produced in 1984.

In music, she is portrayed in the following songs:

* &quot;Didn’t I See This Movie?&quot; (2009) by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey from the musical Next to Normal. 

French singer-songwriter Mylène Farmer chose her stage name in homage to the actress. She is mentioned in &quot;Lobotomy Gets Them Home&quot; (1989) on The Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang&#x27;s album &quot;Silvertown&quot;. She was the subject of a stage play by Sally Clark, &quot;Saint Frances of Hollywood&quot; (1996).

In the 2017 Netflix original series &quot;Mindhunter&quot;, the character version of Edmund Kemper erroneously says Farmer was lobotomized.

Farmer was referenced in the 2022 &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; episode &quot;Billy Jones and the Orgy Lamps&quot; with a character&#x27;s mental breakdown being described as &quot;full-on Frances Farmer.&quot;

<doc id="441739" wikidata="Q159746" url="?curid=441739" title="Flag of Monaco">
<text>The national flag of Monaco () has two equal horizontal bands, of red (top) and white (bottom), both of which have been the heraldic colours of the House of Grimaldi since at least 1339. The present bicolour design was adopted on 4 April 1881, under Charles III.

The ISO code for the flag of Monaco is MC, which produces the icon 🇲🇨.

==Overview==
Monaco&#x27;s original flag, which was similar to its current princely flag but bore an older version of its coat of arms, was in use from the principality&#x27;s early days (except during its annexation to France from 1793 to 1814) until the present, simpler design was adopted in 1881.

Another design (below), the banner of the state arms (lozenges in the Grimaldi family colours, in heraldic terms &quot;lozengy argent and gules&quot;), was used at various times, particularly in the 17th century, as an unofficial flag and still appears in some royal photographs. However, it has no designated use and does not represent any Monegasque official in particular.

The flag of Monaco is graphically similar to the flag of Indonesia, with differences in their dimension ratios (Monaco&#x27;s at 4:5 and Indonesia&#x27;s at 2:3), and the shade of red is darker for the flag of Monaco. The flag of Poland is also similar to that of Monaco, but with the colours reversed – white on top and red on the bottom. The flag of Singapore also has a similar design and colour, with the exception being a crescent with five stars at the upper left side.

==Princely flag==
Monaco&#x27;s princely flag (or government flag) consists of the full achievement of the coat of arms on a white background. It is flown at the Prince&#x27;s palace, government offices, in the presence of government officials, and as an ensign on the Prince&#x27;s yacht.

==Personal standard of Albert II==

The personal standard of Prince Albert II consists of the Crown of Monaco over two opposing letters A, on a white background. It is only used in his immediate presence, particularly on cars in which he travels. It is often seen with a gold fringe on the top, bottom and right, which is one-ninth the height of the white field.

<doc id="441741" wikidata="Q3987206" url="?curid=441741" title="The Georgia Straight">
<text>The Georgia Straight is a free Canadian weekly news and entertainment newspaper published in Vancouver, British Columbia, by Overstory Media Group. Often known simply as &quot;The Straight&quot;, it is delivered to newsboxes, post-secondary schools, public libraries and a large variety of other locations. 
&quot;The Straight&quot; has a long history of independent, unconventional editorials and content, and is known as a vocal critic of government, notably the former Liberal government of Gordon Campbell.

As surveyed by VAC its per-issue circulation average , was once 119,971 copies, and its average weekly readership was once 804,000 . Its website traffic once ranked 92,215 globally and 5,395 within Canada, from Alexa.

In January 2020, the newspaper&#x27;s acquisition by Media Central Corporation was announced, a few weeks after the same company announced a deal to acquire the similar Toronto publication &quot;Now&quot;. In September 2022, after Media Central Corporation filed for bankruptcy, &quot;The Straight&quot; was acquired by Overstory Media Group. 

==History==

The paper was founded as an underground newspaper in May 1967 by Pierre Coupey, Milton Acorn, Dan McLeod, Stan Persky, and others, and originally it operated as a collective.

On May 5, 1967, the first issue was presented and cost ten cents. It was originally a biweekly newspaper. On May 12, Dan McLeod was taken away in a paddy wagon and jailed for three hours for &quot;investigation of vagrancy.&quot; College Printers refused to print the second issue, but an alternative was found.

In 1972, original staff members left &quot;Georgia Straight&quot; to publish the competitor bi-weekly &quot;The Grape&quot;.

===Suspension over &quot;obscenities&quot;===
On May 12, 1967, the paper was raided and fined by the Vancouver Police for publishing obscenities, and was often banned from distribution for its criticism of the local police and politicians. Vancouver mayor Tom Campbell described the paper as &quot;filth&quot; and, objecting of its sale to &quot;school children,&quot; urged the city&#x27;s licensing inspector to suspend the paper for &quot;gross misconduct&quot; contrary to city bylaws. The paper&#x27;s business license was suspended September 9, 1967, making it illegal for them to sell papers.

McLeod announced that he would continue to publish, giving the paper away and asking for donations. During the time the license was suspended, city police attempted to confiscate the &quot;free&quot; papers and to take donation money away from vendors, though any who refused to hand over money or papers were left alone. In addition, McLeod and others associated with the paper were subjected to violent attacks. 

The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) challenged the suspension in court by arguing that only federal laws could restrict freedom-of-the-press. On this matter, the daily papers &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot; both weighed in on the side of the &quot;Georgia Straight&quot;. The initial challenge filed October 2, 1967 was unsuccessful, with Justice Thomas Dohm praising the mayor for his actions. 

On October 6, the Canadian Post Office ruled that the paper was not obscene, allowing for distribution by mail; nonetheless, street vending remained illegal without a city business license. On appeal, the appellate court agreed to lift the suspension on the grounds that a hearing should have been provided to explain why the paper was suspended, but did not rule on the BCCLA&#x27;s freedom-of-the-press argument.

The BCCLA provided further legal assistance to Dan McLeod and the paper when both were criminally charged with three counts of obscenity for publishing a photograph, an advertisement described as being titled &quot;Young man wants to meet women to 30 years old for Muffdiving, etc,&quot; and an article titled &quot;Penis de Milo Created by Cynthia Plaster-Caster.&quot; McLeod and the paper were acquitted on all three charges due to the Crown having failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, with the judge noting that no evidence was provided as to the meaning of the word &quot;muffdiving&quot; and that he could not take judicial notice of a word that he had not previously heard.

Those controversies ended in the 1970s, as the paper moved to become a more conventional news and entertainment weekly, albeit with a progressive editorial slant. Bob Geldof worked as a music journalist for the &quot;Georgia Straight&quot; in the 1970s before he returned to Ireland and joined the Boomtown Rats. In the mid-1990s a second &quot;Straight&quot; newspaper in Calgary, Alberta, called the &quot;Calgary Straight&quot; was produced, however, its existence was brief.

=== BC government tax case ===
Regulatory controversy erupted again in October 2003, when the provincial government sent &quot;The Straight&quot; a bill totalling more than $1 million for outstanding provincial sales tax. In British Columbia, print publications must have at least 25 per cent editorial content to be considered a newspaper, and qualify for exemption from PST on printing bills. The extensive &quot;Time Out&quot; listing of the paper, detailing the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; of virtually every public event in the city, was judged to be advertising – pushing the paper below the required thresholds for a newspaper.

Publisher Dan McLeod said this re-interpretation of the rules was a politically motivated attempt to silence a persistent critic:

&quot;We&#x27;re the only paper that is consistently critical of the government in our editorials week after week, and we&#x27;re the only paper that&#x27;s being fined a million dollars,&quot; he said. &quot;So I put two and two together.&quot;

However, not everyone agreed with McLeod&#x27;s interpretation of events and pointed out that &quot;The Straight&quot; had a significantly lower editorial-to-advertising ratio than many other alternative and university papers. This highly public battle garnered considerable attention, and the BC government later reversed their decision, stating &quot;clearly the Georgia Straight is a newspaper...&quot;

=== Acquisition by Media Central Corporation Inc. ===
On March 2, 2020, Media Central Corporation Inc. announced it has closed its acquisition of Vancouver Free Press Corp, owner and operator of the &quot;Georgia Straight&quot;. The company paid $1.25 million (included fees associated with the transaction) in cash and shares. Media Central Corporation filed for bankruptcy in March 2022. Long-time editors and contributors to the Georgia Straight continued publishing, even as regular paycheques stopped coming in.

=== Acquisition by Overstory Media Group ===
On September 27, 2022, Overstory Media Group announced it had acquired the assets of the &quot;Georgia Straight&quot; for an undisclosed sum. Around a dozen remaining employees at the Straight, including longstanding editor Charlie Smith, were fired shortly before the acquisition and did not receive unpaid wages, severance, or vacation pay. Overstory Media Group has declined to pay back wages, calling it the responsibility of the previous owner. On April 8, 2024, the BC Employment Standards Branch ruled that Overstory Media must pay $270,819.02 in unpaid wages to the group of former employees. Overstory Media made headlines in December 2023 for laying off employees who had voted to unionize in an apparent attempt to quash their union drive. 

In March 2024, Overstory announced that former BC Premier and former Jim Pattison executive Glen Clark has taken over as Interim CEO. Clark resigned as Premier after Conflict of interest commissioner H.A.D. Oliver concluded in 2001 that Clark had violated conflict of interest laws in British Columbia.

==Readership==

A readership survey conducted on behalf of &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; in 2007 found that:

==Content==

&quot;The Straight&quot; carries feature articles, ranging from social topics, such as drug use and gentrification to in-depth looks at cultural newsmakers like the writer Salman Rushdie. Former editor Charlie Smith has a record of covering women&#x27;s movement issues as well as COVID-19, the climate, diverse communities, and arts and culture. There are also many articles and listings on lifestyle and entertainment, commenting on restaurants, new wines, new gadgets, designer clothes, and the latest in music, theatre, and movies. Rounding out the regular features are the American advice columnist Dan Savage with his &quot;Savage Love&quot;, commentator Gwynne Dyer, cartoons, and a local astrology column. The newspaper&#x27;s editorial slant is strongly left wing as conceived in the Canadian political spectrum.

&quot;The Straight&quot; has been criticized for publishing cigarette and other tobacco advertising when most publications in Canada have declined to do so for moral and ethical reasons. And of promoting local events that had tobacco industry sponsorship, such as the formerly Benson and Hedges-sponsored Symphony of Fire. &quot;The Straight&quot; has long been condemned for this practice by the major health groups and, more recently, by Vancouver businessman and political candidate Dale Jackaman in a series of Google attack ads.

<doc id="441747" wikidata="Q358874" url="?curid=441747" title="Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale">
<text>Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale (; born Jarnail Singh Brar; 2 June 1947– 6 June 1984) was a Sikh militant. After Operation Bluestar, he posthumously became the leading figure for the Khalistan movement.

He was the thirteenth &quot;jathedar&quot; or leader, of the prominent orthodox Sikh religious institution Damdami Taksal. An advocate of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, he gained significant attention after his involvement in the 1978 Sikh-Nirankari clash. In the summer of 1982, Bhindranwale and the Akali Dal launched the Dharam Yudh Morcha (&quot;righteous campaign&quot;), with its stated aim being the fulfilment of a list of demands based on the Anandpur Sahib Resolution to create a largely autonomous state within India. Thousands of people joined the movement in the hope of retaining a larger share of irrigation water and the return of Chandigarh to Punjab. There was dissatisfaction in some sections of the Sikh community with prevailing economic, social, and political conditions. Over time Bhindranwale grew to be a leader of Sikh militancy, organizing killer squads to eliminate those he perceived as enemies of Sikhism.

In 1982, Bhindranwale and his group moved to the Golden Temple complex and made it his headquarters. Bhindranwale would establish what amounted to a &quot;parallel government&quot; in Punjab, settling cases and resolving disputes, while conducting his campaign. In 1983, he along with his militant cadre inhabited and fortified the Sikh shrine Akal Takht. Scholars hold him responsible for launching attacks on Hindus and state institutions from the complex; his targeting of Hindus was intended to drive them out of Punjab. Bhindranwale&#x27;s relocation to the Harmandir Sahib complex was to strategically preempt his arrest by the government, as attacks on Hindus by his cohort escalated. In June 1984, Operation Blue Star was carried out by the Indian Army to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib in the Golden Temple Complex, which resulted in hundreds to thousands of deaths according to various reports, including that of Bhindranwale.

Bhindranwale has remained a controversial figure in Indian history. While the Sikhs&#x27; highest temporal authority Akal Takht describe him a &#x27;martyr&#x27;, with immense appeal among rural sections of the Sikh population, who saw him as a powerful leader, who stood up to Indian state dominance and repression, many Indians and academic critics saw him as spearheading a &quot;revivalist, extremist and terrorist movement&quot;. His stance on the creation of a separate Sikh state remains a point of contention.

==Early life==
Bhindranwale was born on 2 June 1947, as Jarnail Singh Brar to a Jat Sikh family, in the village of Rode, in Moga District (then a part of Faridkot District), located in the region of Malwa. The grandson of Sardar Harnam Singh Brar, his father, Joginder Singh Brar was a farmer and a local Sikh leader, and his mother was Nihal Kaur. Jarnail Singh was the seventh of eight siblings of seven brothers and one sister. He was put into a school in 1953 at the age of 6 but he dropped out of school five years later to work with his father on the farm.

=== Marriage ===
He married Pritam Kaur, the daughter of Sucha Singh of Bilaspur at the age of nineteen. The couple had two sons, Ishar Singh and Inderjit Singh, in 1971 and 1975, respectively. After the death of Bhindranwale, Pritam Kaur moved along with her sons to Bilaspur village in Moga district and stayed with her brother. She died of heart ailment at age 60, on 15 September 2007 in Jalandhar.

==Damdami Taksal==

=== Early years ===
In 1965, he was enrolled by his father at the Damdami Taksal also known as Bhindran Taksal, a religious school near Moga, Punjab, named after the village of Bhindran Kalan where its leader Gurbachan Singh Bhindranwale lived. Though based out of Gurdwara Akhand Parkash there, he took his pupils on extended tours of the countryside. After a one-year course in scriptural, theological and historical studies with Gurbachan Singh Khalsa, partly during a tour but mostly during his stay at Gurdwara Sis Asthan Patshahi IX near Nabha, he rejoined his family and returned to farming, marrying in 1966. Maintaining ties with the Taksal, he continued studies under Kartar Singh, who became the new head of the Taksal after Gurbachan Singh Khalsa&#x27;s death in June 1969, and would establish his headquarters at Gurdwara Gurdarshan Prakash at Mehta Chowk, approximately 25 kilometers northeast of Amritsar. He quickly became the favourite student of Kartar Singh. Unlike other students he had had familial responsibilities, and he would take time off from the seminary and go back and forth month to month to take care of his wife and two children, balancing his familial and religious responsibilities.

=== Successor to the Taksal ===
Kartar Singh Khalsa died in a car accident on 16 August 1977. Before his death, Kartar Singh had appointed the then 31-year-old Bhindranwale as his successor. His son, Amrik Singh, would become a close companion of Jarnail Singh.
Bhindranwale was formally elected the 14th jathedar of the Damdami Taksal at a &quot;bhog&quot; ceremony at Mehta Chowk on 25 August 1977. He adopted the name &quot;Bhindranwale&quot; meaning &quot;from [the village of] Bhindran [Kalan]&quot;, the location of the Bhindran Taksal branch of the Damdami Taksal, and attained the religious title of &quot;Sant&quot;. He concluded most of his family responsibilities to dedicate full time to the Taksal, thus following a long tradition of “sants”, an important part of rural Sikh life. Henceforth his family saw him solely in Sikh religious congregations known as satsangs, though his son Ishar Singh would describe his youth as being &quot;well looked after&quot; and &quot;never in need.&quot; As a missionary Sant of the Taksal, he would tour the villages to give dramatic public sermons and reading of scripture. He preached the disaffected young Sikhs, encouraging them to return to the path of the Khalsa by giving up consumerism in family life and abstaining from drugs and alcohol, the two main vices afflicting rural society in Punjab, and as a social reformer, denounced practices like the dowry, and encouraged a return to the simple lifestyle prior to the increased wealth of the state and the reversal of the decline in morals following the Green Revolution. As one observer noted, &quot;The Sant&#x27;s following grew as he successfully regenerated the good life of purity, dedication and hard work... These basic values of life...had been the first casualty of commercial capitalism.&quot; His focus on fighting for the Sikh cause appealed to many young Sikhs. Bhindranwale never learned English but had good grasp of Punjabi language. His speeches were released in the form of audio cassette tapes and circulated in villages. Later on, he became adept with press and gave radio and television interviews as well. His sermons urged the centrality of religious values to life, calling on the members of congregations to be:

From July 1977 to July 1982, he extensively toured cities and villages of Punjab to preach the Sikh faith. He also visited other states and cities in India, mostly in &quot;gurdwaras&quot;, in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. His meetings were attended by rapt &quot;throngs of the faithful – and the curious.&quot; He advocated against decreasing religious observance, cultural changes occurring in Punjab, rising substance abuse, and use of alcohol and pornography, encouraging religious initiation by taking amrit (the administration of which had been his primary task during his tours) and fulfilling religious obligations, including wearing the outward religious symbols of the faith, like the turban and beard. He appeared at a time when leaders were not engaged in the community, traveled from city to city instead of being based in an office or &quot;gurdwara&quot; and delegating, solved domestic disputes and showed no interest in a political career, seeing himself foremost as a man of religion. People soon began to seek his intervention in addressing social grievances, and he began to hold court to settle disputes. This reflected the widespread disenchantment among the masses with expensive, time-consuming bureaucratic procedures that often did not ensure justice. Bhindranwale&#x27;s verdicts were widely respected and helped to gain him enormous popularity, as well as his &quot;remarkable ability&quot; as a preacher and his ability to quote religious texts and evoke the relevance of historical events in the present time.

Khushwant Singh, a critic of Bhindranwale, allowed that 

==Politics==
Bhindranwale was active in politics. It has been claimed that Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Congress party attempted to co-opt Bhindranwale in a bid to split Sikh votes and weaken the Akali Dal, its chief rival in Punjab. Congress supported the candidates backed by Bhindranwale in the 1978 SGPC elections. The theory of Congress involvement has been contested on grounds including that Gandhi&#x27;s imposition of President&#x27;s rule in 1980 had essentially disbanded all Punjab political powers regardless, with no assistance required to take control, and has been challenged by scholarship.

The Congress CM (and later President) Giani Zail Singh, who allegedly financed the initial meetings of the separatist organisation Dal Khalsa, amid attempts to cater to and capitalize on the surge in Sikh religious revivalism in Punjab. The Akali Dal would also attempt to cater to the same electoral trend during the same period following electoral defeats in 1972 and 1980, resulting from a pivot to a secular strategy in the 1960s and the accompanying coalition partnerships necessary to guarantee electoral success, most notably with the Jan Sangh, a party of urban Hindu communalism. This later turned out to be a miscalculation by Congress, as Bhindranwale&#x27;s political objectives became popular among the agricultural Jat Sikhs in the region, as he would advocate for the state&#x27;s water rights central to the state&#x27;s economy, in addition to leading Sikh revivalism.

In 1979, Bhindranwale put up forty candidates against the Akali candidates in the SGPC election for a total of 140 seats, winning four seats. A year later, Bhindranwale used Zail Singh&#x27;s patronage to put up candidates in three constituencies&#x27; during the general elections, winning a significant number of seats from Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Ferozepur districts. Despite this success, he would not personally seek any political office. He had the acumen to play off of both Akali and Congress attempts to capitalize off of him, as association with him garnered Sikh votes while putting other constituencies at risk. According to one analysis,

Bhindranwale himself addressed rumors of being such an agent, which were spread by Akali leadership during mid-1983, as his expanding support came at the expense of the Akali Dal amid mass leadership defections, seeing them as attempts to reduce his by-then huge support base in Punjab. He would refute this in April 1984 by comparing his actions to the Akalis, referring to the granting of gun licenses to Akalis by the Congress administration while his had been canceled, and that he did not enter the house of any Congress-aligned faction (including congressites, communists, and socialists), Sikhs associated with him being arrested and their homes confiscated, and police destruction on his property, while Akali politicians would have dinners with figures aligned with Congress, like former chief minister Darbara Singh, who Bhindranwale would accuse of atrocities against Sikhs.

Bhindranwale did not respect conventional SGPC or Akali Dal apparatchiks, believing them to have &quot;become mealy-mouthed, corrupt and deviated from the martial tenets of the faith,&quot; after they had failed to support the Sikhs during the 1978 Sikh-Nirankari clashes due to pressure from their coalition partners. Described as having &quot;unflinching zeal and firm convictions,&quot; Bhindranwale did &quot;not succumb to the pressure of big-wigs in the Akali Party nor could he be manipulated by the authorities to serve their ends.&quot; According to Gurdarshan Singh, &quot;Those who tried to mend him or bend him to suit their designs underestimated his tremendous will and ultimately lost their own ground. He never became their tool. People who promoted his cause or helped him to rise to prominence were disillusioned, when he refused to play the second fiddle to them and declined to tread the path laid down for him. Paradoxical though it may seem, they became his unwilling tools. Thousands listened to him with rapt attention at the Manji Sahib gatherings. He had tremendous power to mobilise the masses. His charisma and eloquence overshadowed other leaders.&quot;

In order to overcome the hegemony of the Akali Dal, rather than being used, Bhindranwale would exploit the Congress and then the Akali Dal itself. The Akali Dal had begun to neglect Sikh needs in favor of maintaining political alliances necessary to keep power, resulting in their electoral loss in 1972, and the resulting Anandpur Sahib Resolution, meant to win back Sikh support, remained neglected while the party focused on reversing the overcentralization of political power that had taken place during the Emergency. Described as &quot;a rational actor with his own goals,&quot; his first concern was to rejuvenate Sikhism as a leader of the community.

Further, the Damdami Taksal already had a history of openly opposing and criticizing Congress government policies before, as Kartar Singh Khalsa Bhindranwale, the leader of the institution prior to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, had been a severe critic of the excesses of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Emergency rule, even in her presence as far back as 1975. Kartar Singh had also gotten a resolution passed by the SGPC on 18 November 1973, condemning the various anti-Sikh activities of the Sant Nirankaris, which were based in Delhi. Both Kartar Singh Bhindranwale and the Damdami Taksal had commanded such a level of respect in Sikh religious life that the Akali ministry had given him a state funeral upon his death on 20 August 1977. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale would also mention the Sikhs facing the government with 37 major protests against Emergency rule under Congress during this era as fighting against tyranny. Emergency rule had initially been utilized to avert criminal charges on Gandhi, who was linked to misuse of government property during the upcoming election, which would have invalidated her campaign, and endowed the central government with powers including preemptive arrests, as well as the arrest of many political opponents.

On Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale becoming leader of the Damdami Taksal, another of the Taksal students explained, “[Nothing changed] in political terms. It was just the same way. The Indian government thought that maybe although they could not stop Sant Kartar Singh [Bhindranwale], maybe Sant Jarnail Singh [Bhindranwale] would be weaker. That was not the case.”

===Clash with Sant Nirankaris===

On 13 April 1978, the anniversary of the founding of the Khalsa, a Sant Nirankari convention was organized in Amritsar, with permission from the Akali state government. The practices of the &quot;Sant Nirankaris&quot; subsect of Nirankaris was considered as heretics by the orthodox Sikhism expounded by Bhindranwale, though the conflict between the Sikhs and the Sant Nirankaris preceded Bhindranwale; the Sant Nirankaris had been declared by the priests of the Golden Temple as enemies of the Sikhs in 1973, and the Damdami Taksal had opposed them since the 1960s, during the time of Kartar Singh Khalsa. They had exemplified both the internal and external threats to Sikhism that Bhindranwale spoke of in speeches, as their scriptures made derogatory references to the Guru Granth Sahib, the sect&#x27;s leader proclaiming himself as a guru in its place and calling himself the baja-wala (a reference to Guru Gobind Singh), and because of their undermining of the Sikh structure and affiliation with Congress.

From the Golden Temple premises, Bhindranwale delivered a stirring sermon, where he announced he would not allow the Nirankari convention to take place. According to Tully and Jacob, Bhindranwale declared &quot;We are going to march there and cut them to pieces!&quot; According to Harjot Singh Oberoi, Bhindranwale and other Sikh religious leaders delivered inflammatory speeches prompting a Sikh congregation to confront the Nirankaris. After the speech a large contingent of about two hundred Sikhs led by Bhindranwale and Fauja Singh, the head of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, left the Golden Temple and proceeded to the Nirankari Convention with the intention of stopping its proceedings. An agitated Sikh within the procession cut the arm of a Hindu shopkeeper whilst Bhindranwale&#x27;s contingent were shouting slogans against Nirankaris. The protest of the Sikhs was shot at by the armed guards of the Nirankari chief, subsequently resulting in an armed clash between the two groups. Fauja Singh allegedly attempted to behead Nirankari chief Gurbachan Singh with his sword but was shot dead by Gurbachan&#x27;s bodyguard. In the ensuing violence, several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale&#x27;s followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three members of the Sant Nirankari sect. This event brought Bhindranwale to the limelight in the media, and brought him into the political arena. According to Kirpal Dhillon, former DGP of Punjab, the reported participation of some senior Punjab government officials in the convention also may have emboldened the Sant Nirankaris to attack the protestors.

Sikhs reacted to the clashes by holding massive demonstrations, some violent, in both Punjab and Delhi. A religious letter of authority was released by Akal Takht, the governing Sikh body, which directed Sikhs to use &quot;all appropriate means&quot; to prevent the Sant Nirankaris from growing and flourishing in society, and forbid Sikhs from keeping social ties with the Nirankaris and threatened those who did not do so with religious punishment (left ambiguous, though clarified by the &quot;jathedar&quot; to mean by standard religious teaching).

A criminal case was filed against sixty two Nirankaris, by the Akali led government in Punjab. The investigation concluded that the attack on the Sikhs was planned by a number of accused, including Gurbachan Singh. All the accused were taken into custody except Gurbachan Singh, who was arrested later in Delhi, but only after a personal audience with the Prime Minister Morarji Desai. The Sant Nirankaris had firmly supported the Emergency, and developed close links with many Congress politicians and bureaucrats, creating a strong foothold in Delhi political circles, as well as engendering opposition from the Akalis and the Damdami Taksal during the same period.

The case was heard in the neighbouring Haryana state, and all the accused were acquitted on grounds of self-defence on 4 January 1980, two days before the Lok Sabha poll. Though the case failed as authorities in Punjab were unable to ensure that the prosecution witness remained uncompromised by interested parties and police in Karnal, the Punjab government Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal decided not to appeal the decision. The case of the Nirankaris received widespread support in the Hindi media in Punjab and from Congress, which upon returning to central power also dismissed the Akali government in Punjab, where fresh elections were held and a Congress government installed; orthodox Sikhs considered this to be a conspiracy to defame the Sikh religion.

Bhindranwale increased his rhetoric against the enemies of Sikhs. The chief proponents of this rhetoric were the Babbar Khalsa founded by the widow, Bibi Amarjit Kaur of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, whose husband Fauja Singh had been at the head of the march in Amritsar; the Damdami Taksal led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who had also been in Amritsar on the day of the outrage; the Dal Khalsa, formed after the events; and the All India Sikh Students Federation. His &quot;very public&quot; rhetoric of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s involvement in the trials was one of the initial reasons the central government became concerned with Bhindranwale, as well as the historic martial identity Sikhs were returning to because of him. Under Bhindranwale, the number of people joining the Khalsa increased. The rhetoric that were based on the &quot;perceived &#x27;assault&#x27; on Sikh values from the Hindu community&quot;, also increased in this period.

In the subsequent years following this event, several murders took place in Punjab and the surrounding areas, regarded to be committed by Bhindranwale&#x27;s group or the newly founded Babbar Khalsa, which opposed Bhindranwale and was more inclined towards committing sectarian violence and enforcing Sikh personal law The Babbar Khalsa activists took up residence in the Golden Temple, where they would retreat to, after committing &quot;acts of punishment&quot; on people against the orthodox Sikh tenets. On 24 April 1980, The Nirankari head, Gurbachan was murdered. The First Information Report named twenty people for the murder, including several known associates of Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale, who was also charged with conspiracy to murder. Bhindranwale took residence in Golden Temple to allegedly escape arrest when he was accused of the assassination of Nirankari Gurbachan Singh. Bhindranwale remained in hiding until the Home Minister of India, Zail Singh announced to Parliament that Bhindranwale had nothing to do with the murder. Shortly after, Bhindranwale announced that the killer of the Nirankari chief deserved to be honored by the high priest of Akal Takht, and that he would weigh the killers in gold if they came to him. It would turn out that a member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered and admitted to the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the Tihar Jail in Delhi.

===The AISSF===
Bhindranwale&#x27;s message was enthusiastically received by an emerging underclass of educated rural Sikhs,
whose suffered from the unequal distribution of benefits from the Green Revolution. Punjab had enjoyed the second-highest percentage of children in school after Kerala at the time, along with high college enrollment, at the same time with unemployment rates among college graduates far above the national average. Unemployment was caused by distortions caused by the disparity between agricultural growth and a stunted industrial sector; marginal and poor peasants could not reap the benefits of the land nor find employment in the industrial sector. By the late 1970s the educations of rural Sikhs, many from the Majha area, did not reap financial benefit, many found the urban college environment alienating, and the Akali Dal was engaged in political activities that bore little relation to the demands of educated but unemployed rural Sikhs youth. Bhindranwale&#x27;s message increasingly appealed to them, and their support grew with police excesses, and as Bhindranwale expressed concern over the many breaches of civil rights, and those killed during and after 1978 in protests. The class dimension was described by &quot;India Today&quot; in 1986 as follows:

The All-India Sikh Students Federation, or AISSF, founded in 1943 to attract educated Sikh youth to the Akali movement, had traditionally followed the direction of the Akali Dal and fought for more political power for the Sikhs, fighting for an independent Sikh state before Partition, and afterwards taking up the Punjabi Suba cause. After the establishment of Punjab state, the AISSF had fallen into disarray by the 1970s, and during this period of increasing economic pressures on the state, student politics were dominated by rural Communist organizations. Amrik Singh was elected president in July 1978, and his organizational skills and Bhindranwale&#x27;s legitimacy as the head of a respected religious institution restored the Federation as a powerful political force, and the AISSF and Bhindranwale were further united in being anti-Communist. With a well-educated leadership, many with advanced degrees, membership exploded from 10,000 to well over 100,000, and under Amrik Singh, the AISSF&#x27;s first concern was the Sikh identity.

AISSF secretary-general Harminder Singh Sandhu ascribed the preceding period of youth politics as resulting from the passivity of the Akali leadership in relation to the central government, seen as betraying Sikh interests, which caused resentment among the AISSF. By 1980 they felt ready to redefine Punjab&#x27;s relationship with the center, and the revival of the AISSF and the presence of Bhindranwale put enormous pressure on the Akali Dal.

Bhindranwale was suspicious of Sikh elites, describing them as a class possessing the ability for multiple allegiances, and therefore, could not be relied upon by a mass movement based upon religious foundations which justified protest against discrimination and abuses of power and repression. As such he was often opposed particularly by some Sikh members of the class with business and land interests outside of Punjab, and those occupying high administrative positions. As part of a preaching tradition, he saw the lives of such Sikhs, described as sycophants of Indira Gandhi for power, as a departure threatening the distinct identity of the Sikhs. He saw that path as having to be corrected, along with deviationist and Communist trends, of Sikh officers whose loyalty lay with the state over the Sikh &quot;panth&quot; tradition, emphasizing unification of the community and pushing those officers in government service to work for such unity.

In May 1981, the AISSF led a protest against tobacco and other intoxicants in the religious city of Amritsar. The Arya Samaj had also led protests against alcohol and meat in the city, though it would be with Bhindranwale and the Sikhs that the police clashed on 31 May, resulting in a dozen Sikh deaths and adding to tensions.

===Incident at Chando Kalan===
On 9 September 1981, Lala Jagat Narain, the founder editor of the newspaper &quot;Punjab Kesari&quot;, was murdered. He was viewed as a supporter of the Nirankari sect and had written several editorials that had condemned Bhindranwale. An Arya Samaji known for his staunch communal tendencies reflected in his daily newspaper in Punjab, Lala had urged Hindus of Punjab to reply to government census that Hindi and not Punjabi was their mother tongue and decried the Anandpur Sahib Resolution. His paper played a significant role in &quot;fanning the flames of communal hatred between Hindus and Sikhs,&quot; and the Hindi press based in Jalandhar consistently vilified the Sikhs, without making any distinction between one Sikh group or another. Narain had been present at the clash between the Nirankaris and the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and had served as a witness in the court case of the incident.

Punjab Police issued a warrant for Bhindranwale&#x27;s arrest in the editor&#x27;s murder, as he had often spoken out against the well-known editor. Bhindranwale, who at the time was on a preaching tour, was camped in Chando Kalan, a village in Hissar district in Haryana, 200 miles from Amritsar. A combined force of Punjab and Haryana Police planned a search operation in an attempt to locate and arrest Bhindranwale on 14 September 1981. According to veteran Indian journalist Kuldip Nayar, the Haryana Chief Minister, Bhajan Lal was instructed by the Home Minister, Zail Singh, to not arrest Bhindranwale. While Bhindranwale had relocated to Mehta Chowk, but the police fired upon his band of disciples, looted their luggage, and burned their religious texts. Bhindranwale and others Sikh religious leaders also relayed that police had behaved illegally with the Sikh inhabitants of the village during the search in which the valuables from homes belonging to Sikhs were reported to have been looted and two buses owned by the Damdami Taksal containing a number of Birs (copies) of the Guru Granth Sahib were set on fire.

There was violence in Chando Kalan when the Punjab Police team reached the location, between supporters of Bhindranwale and police. The Punjab Police, incensed that the Haryana Police had allowed Bhindranwale to flee, set his vans which had contained written records of sermons of Bhindranwale for posterity on fire. According to the official version: When the Punjab Police arrived to Chando Kalan to arrest Bhindranwale, some followers of his fired upon the police, resulting in exchange of fire and incidents of arson. The clashes with the police resulted in the deaths of at least 11 people. The burning of his sermons had angered Bhindranwale, who secured himself in his fortified Gurdwara Gurdarshan Parkash located at Mehta Chowk. Bhindranwale at this point turned against Zail Singh and other senior congress leaders with whom he was previously associated with.

====Arrest at Mehta Chowk====
As his location became common knowledge, the police surrounded the gurdwara at Mehta Chowk. Darbara Singh insisted on Bhindranwale&#x27;s arrest, though the central government feared the possibility of clashes as large numbers of Sikhs had gathered at the gurdwara in his support. For negotiating Bhindranwale&#x27;s surrender, the senior officers went inside the gurdwara. Bhindranwale agreed to surrender for arrest at 1:00 p.m. on 20 September 1981, but added a condition that will do so only after addressing the religious congregation. This condition was accepted by the police. At the agreed time he emerged address a large crowd of his followers who armed with spears, swords and several firearms. Several prominent Akali leaders such as Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Harchand Singh Longowal and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee&#x27;s Jathedar Santokh Singh were present. Bhindranwale delivered a sermon proclaiming his innocence and against the state government trying to have him arrested, receiving the support of almost every senior Akali leader, also against the perceived injustices done to the Sikhs and himself. He ended his speech asking the mob not to act violent after his arrest. Bhindranwale then offered himself to the police for arrest on 20 September 1981, and was taken to a circuit house instead of prison. Shortly after Bhindranwale courted arrest, agitated Sikhs clashed with the police and paramilitary forces, resulting in the death of 18 protestors.

On the day of his arrest, three armed men on motorcycle opened fire using machine guns in a market in Jalandhar in retaliation, killing four people and injured twelve. The next day, in another incident at Tarn Taran one Hindu man was killed and thirteen people were injured. On 25 September, in Amritsar a goods train was derailed. On 29 September, Indian Airlines Flight 423 was hijacked and taken to Lahore. The hijackers demanded Bhindranwale&#x27;s release. Several bomb blasts were made in Punjab&#x27;s Amritsar, Faridkot and Gurdaspur districts.
Several violent incidents happened in Punjab during the next 25 days after the arrest. The Akali Dal leadership was in the process of reestablishing its Sikh credentials after its secular administration during its protests against the Emergency, and under Longowal decided to publicly support Bhindranwale, the most popular Sikh religious leader in Punjab at that point. Bhindranwale also got support from the President of the SGPC, Tohra and the Jathedar of the Akal Takht, Gurdial Singh Ajnoha. India&#x27;s Home Minister, Giani Zail Singh, then announced in the Parliament that there was no evidence against Bhindranwale in his involvement in Lala Jagat Narain&#x27;s murder, and on 14 October 1981 Bhindranwale was released by the Punjab Police. After his release he was able to keep the party on a strongly nationalist course, and released a public statement approving the murders of Gurbachan Singh and Lala Jagat Narain and that the killers deserved to be honoured and awarded their weight in gold, according to KPS Gill. In a statement regarding Narain in early 1982 for the publication &quot;India Today&quot;, Bhindranwale stated:
Bhindranwale&#x27;s arrest and subsequent release raised his stature among the Sikh populace and especially the youth, who, comparing him to the ineffectual Akali leadership, flocked to him. He would become increasingly outspoken toward the Congress government, which would attempt to harass and detain him and other senior members of the Taksal several times in 1982.

==Dharam Yudh Morcha==

The Anandpur Sahib Resolution, and the 1978 Ludhiana Resolution based on it, put socio-economic concerns at the core and called for an end to the center&#x27;s control of Punjab&#x27;s river waters and its unjust distribution, state control of the headworks, and better procurement prices and subsidies for the state&#x27;s farmers. These issues were of particular concern to the state&#x27;s rural Sikh population who supported them, as the Sikhs dominated the agricultural sector and rural areas. Other demands included the maintenance of the ratio of Sikhs in the army, protections of Sikhs outside Punjab, Punjabi as a second language for states with significant Punjabi-speaking populations, amendments to tax and property policies for rural populations, a broadcasting station and a dry port at Amritsar, and a stock exchange at Ludhiana.

From a set of 45 economic, political, religious, and social policies formulated in September 1981, a list of 15 demands would be prepared in October, of which five were economic. The Dharam Yudh Morcha would champion these preliminary demands. The subsequent inclusion of religious demands were a result of polarization of Akali goals following failed negotiations in November with the Congress government, which would raise the spectre of separatism to exploit the fears of Hindu voters and push the Akalis into a corner. Other factors included attempts to ally with, or outbid, more militant Sikh factions, which gained traction following the lack of progress in talks, and the growing religious revivalism that both the Akalis and Congress would attempt to play to gain influence. According to Atul Kohli,

As a result of his rising popularity, Bhindranwale faced opposition from all sides, including the government and rival Sikh factions, both political and militant. One of Bhindranwale&#x27;s main concerns in his speeches was condemning factionalism and internal disunity among the Sikhs. The Akali Dal leadership had initially opposed Bhindranwale. While Bhindranwale ceded leadership to the Akali Dal and disavowed political ambition, in 1980 the Akali Dal faced a serious challenge from Bhindranwale and his mass support from the AISSF, the Akali youth wing. As Bhindranwale became increasingly influential, the party decided to join forces with him. In August 1982, under the leadership of Harcharan Singh Longowal, the Akali Dal launched the &quot;Dharam Yudh Morcha&quot;, or &quot;righteous campaign,&quot; in collaboration with Bhindranwale to win more autonomy for Punjab. At the start of the protest movement, in response to long-standing wrongs not addressed by the state&#x27;s economic and political process, the Akali leaders had, in their Ardas, or prayer, at the Akal Takht, resolved that they would continue the struggle until the Anandpur Sahib Resolution was accepted and implemented by the Government. The Akalis, in their subsequent electoral defeat in 1980, would be forced by the presence of Bhindranwale and his huge base of support in the AISSF to return to its Sikh base, for whom the Anandpur Sahib Resolution had originally been written to regain the declining support of, before it had fallen by the wayside.

Later, noting Indira Gandhi&#x27;s intransigence, it appeared that the Akali leaders were willing to water down their demands. Bhindranwale reminded his audiences that it had been Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Surjit Singh Barnala, Balwant Singh and other leaders who had been were signatories to the Anandpur Sahib Resolution and that he was not present when the Resolution was adopted. He insisted, however, that having said the Ardas at the Akal Takht, no Sikh could go back on his solemn word. Longowal&#x27;s core political base began to wither; about a third of his SGPC members and district Akali presidents reportedly defected to Bhindranwale. Bhindranwale promised the Sikh masses that he would not allow the chief Akali leadership to fail them as during the Punjabi Suba movement.

Despite the Resolution&#x27;s endorsement of &quot;the principle of State autonomy in keeping with the concept of Federalism,&quot; Indira Gandhi and the central government took a hard line, emphasizing the Sikh demands and treating them as tantamount to secession, thus putting moderate Sikh politicians at a competitive disadvantage in an increasingly frustrated and militant political arena. She would be later characterized by prime minister Charan Singh as following &quot;a megalomaniacal policy based on elitist philosophies,&quot; and her successor Rajiv Gandhi would later describe the Resolution as &quot;not secessionist but negotiable,&quot; recognizing the failures of her autocratic style of governance. Thousands of people joined the movement as they felt that it represented a real solution to their demands, such as a larger share of water for irrigation, and return of Chandigarh to Punjab. By early October, more than 25,000 Akali workers courted arrest in Punjab in support of the agitation.

===Protests===
The basic issues of the Dharam Yudh Morcha were related to the prevention of the digging of the SYL Canal, the redrawing of Punjab&#x27;s boundaries following the Punjabi Suba movement to include left-out Punjabi-speaking areas, the restoration of Chandigarh to Punjab, the redefining of relations between the central government and the state, and greater autonomy for the state as envisioned in the Anandpur Sahib Resolution and as was constitutionally due. The most important demand was the restoration of the state&#x27;s river waters as per constitutional, national and international norms based on riparian principles; more than 75% of the state&#x27;s river water were being drained from the state, to Rajasthan and Haryana, which were non-riparian states, and its accompanying hydropower potential, powered by Punjab&#x27;s only natural wealth.

Following failed talks, the &quot;Nehr Roko Morcha&quot;, or “struggle to stop the canal,” was launched on April 24, 1982, by the Akali Dal at the village of Kapuri, Punjab to prevent the initial digging of the SYL Canal which would have diverted most of the state&#x27;s water to Haryana, resulting in volunteer arrests. The protest, despite massive support from the Sikh peasantry, was not yielding results as Kapuri, where the Prime Minister had inaugurated the digging of the canal, was a remote border village distant from Akali headquarters, and the Akalis would decide to relocate the agitation to Amritsar in August. Meanwhile, an attempt had been made to arrest Bhindranwale on 20 April 1982 while he was staying in the Singh Sabha Gurdwara in Dadar in Mumbai, though he would successfully reach the safety of his base in Mehta Chowk. However, he would leave his base in Chowk Mehta for the security of the Guru Nanak Niwas in the Golden Temple complex on 20 July and call for a Panthic convention there on 25 July for the release of his men, after Amrik Singh was arrested on 19 July with two other followers; Amrik Singh had offended the appointed Punjab Governor Marri Chenna Reddy by protesting the mass arrest of the Akali volunteers and pleading their case, while Thara Singh, another leading member of the Taksal, was arrested the following day, highly provoking Bhindranwale. He joined his movement for their release to the larger Akali movement, which was then already designated &quot;dharam yudh&quot;, for their political, economic, cultural, and religious demands.

Further morchas included the &quot;Raasta Roko&quot;, &quot;Kamm Roko&quot;, and &quot;Rail Roko&quot; morchas; with the exception of the &quot;Rasta Roko&quot; morcha in which some 20 protesters were killed in police firing, all others had ended peacefully.

The Dharam Yudh Morcha was launched later that year on 4 August, following an Akali Dal meeting in July at Amritsar; Bhindranwale and Jathedar Jagdev Singh Talwandi were persuaded to lead it under the Akali Dal banner and the leadership of Longowal, to whom Bhindranwale swore loyalty. The movement began with Akalis courting arrest with a large number of volunteers.

During the implementation of various agricultural restrictions under Congress, the Akali Dal had accomplished little in response, and in addition, the possibility of forging an Akali-Congress partnership in Punjab was being privately explored. This caused the decline of support for the Akalis and the concurrent increase of support for Bhindranwale&#x27;s message among both educated orthodox Sikhs and the rural population, along with what was increasingly seen as the ineffectual Akali approach of protests and inter-party collaboration in producing results for Punjab, leaving open a political space for those who argued that increased militancy was the only means for protecting Sikh interests.

The Akali movement gained momentum in August and September, and the government began to run out of room in jails for the over 25,000 volunteer protesters. Over 100,000 protesters would be arrested over the course of the &quot;morcha&quot;. The central government, instead of preempting any Akali agitation in regard to the Punjab by constitutionally referring all the legal issues to the Supreme Court, which the Akali Dal had demanded, played up the threat of extremism and law and order, and appeared disinclined to solve the issues justly or constitutionally. As late as May 1984, the Congress government continued to frame the protest as a religion-based stir, as opposed to a comprehensive movement driven by political, economic, and territorial issues central to the Declaration and in the interests of all residents of Punjab. The considered view of the Governor of West Bengal sent to Punjab, B. D. Pande, that a political problem required a political solution, went unheeded.

In response to demands that the Supreme Court be consulted in regards to concerns that the center was unconstitutionally usurping water from Punjab, the central government found loopholes to circumvent such a demand, instead offering a tribunal, which did not have the authority to override the Punjab Reorganization Act to begin with, and never issued a final decision over an issue critical to agricultural growth and state development.

Later, in May 1984, one day after an Akali procession in Amritsar against a ban on tobacco and meat products in the vicinity of the Golden Temple, the Hindi Suraksha Samiti, which had been formed in response to the Akali protest, organized a counterdemonstration in favor of tobacco.

===Police===
The Punjab Police, due to colonial policing traditions different than those in the rest of the country, which resulted from being from the last region to be annexed by the British (in 1849) and the extremely turbulent early years of British rule, had had much more free rein to act than in other provinces; the influence of those policies persisted after independence. The police would react to incidents by rounding up and illegally detaining suspects in large numbers for prolonged aggressive interrogation, often killing detainees in staged encounters. There was little faith in complaint inquiries from ordinary citizens, due to lawless police activity having tacit approval from the state police leadership.

Under the pretext of maintaining law and order, central state actions in the form of false encounters, tortures and killings in police custody, as well as extrajudicial police invasions and oppressive lockdowns in rural Punjab, increased. It became known that during the period, certain police officials and others had been guilty of excesses or violence. Atrocities committed by named officers were narrated in open meetings by Bhindranwale or the concerned victims, but neither the charges of the victims, reports to the authorities, nor other complaints were responded to by the administration to rectify current complaints or improve future procedures, much less for punishing the offenders. This perceived official apathy and callousness led many began to believe that what was happening was at the behest of the administration, and that state violence was being practiced to defame Sikhs to turn public opinion in order to sidetrack the real issues of state resources and constitutional procedure, as neither issues nor reported rights violations were being addressed. Bhindranwale spoke of staged crimes, in which Sikhs were accused of theft or violence, with the intention of linking the falsely accused to Bhindranwale, with any declared act being said to be on his orders, and that many of the Sikhs arrested on false accusations were tortured and killed. Accusations of violent force on the Sikhs also included the earlier burning of buses belonging to the Damdami Taksal containing Sikh scriptures, and Sikh train passengers being singled out and beaten on false pretenses.

Out of 220 deaths during the first 19 months of the Dharam Yudh Morcha, 190 had been Sikhs, with over 160 Sikhs killed during the first 16 months, with the Akalis alleging that reactive killings were being done by agent provocateurs, and reports appearing that such communal incidents had been initiated by Congress to inflame Hindu feelings. Despite emphatic demands for a detailed judicial inquiry, the central government was unwilling to initiate any such process. Extrajudicial killings by the police of orthodox Sikh youth in rural areas during the summer and winter of 1982 and early 1983 resulted in retaliatory violence.

Bhindranwale was particularly upset about the police atrocities and the murder of scores of Sikhs in the garb of false and contrived police encounters. He was often heard criticizing the double standards of the Government in treating Hindu and Sikh victims of violence, citing various incidents like the immediate appointment of an inquiry committee to probe Lala Jagat Narain&#x27;s murder while not for the killing of the Sikhs, including the firing on peaceful Sikh protesters in the successful &quot;Rasta Roko&quot; agitation on 4 April 1983, killing 24, believing that this partisan behavior of the Government was bound to hasten the process of alienation of the Sikhs. He reprimanded the press for suppressing incidences of police atrocities, and of the double standards of dealing with Sikhs.

A team sponsored by the PUCL, with Justice V. M. Tarkunde as chairman and famed journalist Kuldip Nayar as a member, to assess the police excesses against Sikhs. It reported:

In the words of Mark Tully and Satish Jacob, BBC correspondents, these deadly encounters were justified as a reasonable method of avoiding lengthy court trials:
Though Akali demands were largely for the developmental welfare of the state of Punjab as a whole, with demands only made to the government and not in regards to other communities, police killings, including extrajudicial actions of fatal torture and mutilations of detainees, with some subsequently declared as escapees, as well as unprovoked attacks on innocent individual Sikhs, were carried out by mobs of the Hindi Suraksha Samiti, mobilized by the Arya Samaj. These incidents sparked off retributory attacks against them by Sikh youths. After the launch of the Dharam Yudh Morcha, and subsequent governmental inaction in regards to police brutality, Sikh activists began committing retaliatory acts of political violence. An assassination attempt was made on Chief Minister of Punjab Darbara Singh and two Indian Airlines flights were hijacked.

Following protester deaths, Swaran Singh restarted negotiations on behalf of Gandhi with the Akalis after releasing all arrested Akali volunteers, reaching agreements on Chandigarh, river waters, Centre-State relations, and the Amritsar broadcast, which were approved by a cabinet subcommittee. While Swaran Singh relayed the government&#x27;s approval of the agreement, Gandhi had changed it significantly before submitting it to Parliament. The talks would collapse after this action, and Longowal would announce in November 1982 the continuation of the protests in Delhi during the 1982 Asian Games. Another round of talks between the Akalis and Congress MP Amrinder Singh was successful, but was sabotaged by Bhajan Lal, the Chief Minister of Haryana, who stated that protests, which were largely stifled, would not be allowed in Haryana during the event, and ensured that Sikhs allowed to pass through, regardless of social position, whether retired military, politician, or ordinary citizen, were subjected to various procedures including invasive friskings and removal of turbans; Sikhs travelling from Punjab to Delhi or back were indiscriminately stopped, searched, and humiliated, and Sikhs understood this humiliation not just individually but as a community; according to journalist Kuldip Nayyar, &quot;from that day their feeling of alienation [had] been increasing.&quot; A few months after the Asian Games, anti-Sikh riots in Panipat on 14 February 1983 resulted in many Sikh deaths, damage to property of Sikhs, and extensive damage to gurdwaras, during which the state police remained inactive.

Bhindranwale, then regarded as the &quot;single most important Akali leader,&quot; announced that nothing less than full implementation of the Anandpur resolution was acceptable to them. The Sikh volunteers who answered his call on 3 September 1983 were not satisfied with either the methods or the results of Longowal&#x27;s methods, as a rift emerged between the two leaders, with Bhindranwale referring to Longowal&#x27;s rooms in the Golden Temple complex as &quot;Gandhi Niwas&quot; (&quot;Gandhi residence&quot;), and Longowal referring to his rooms as a wild &quot;Chambal&quot; region. Bhindranwale would denounce the double standard of Congress-supporting hijackers, who had demanded the release of Indira Gandhi after her post-Emergency arrest, being rewarded with seats in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly, while demanding punishment for Sikh protesters who had done the same. He would comment in 1982, &quot;If the Pandey brothers in Uttar Pradesh hijack a plane for a woman (Mrs. Gandhi) they are rewarded with political positions. If the Sikhs hijack a plane to Lahore and that too for a cause, they are dubbed traitors. Why two laws for the same crime?&quot;
With the release of Amrik Singh in July 1983, Bhindranwale felt confident of the advancement of the movement without the Akali leadership; they would part ways in December, two months after the imposition of President&#x27;s rule.

===Press disinformation===
There would be significant government interference in information released to the media itself. According to Cynthia Keppley Mahmood, &quot;The clearly distorted account of the event released to the media does not speak well for India&#x27;s vaunted freedom of press. Stories of prostitutes and drugs at the Akal Takht were printed on front pages one week, that recanted in back pages the next. A story suggesting that Bhindranwale had committed suicide was followed by one describing his body as riddled with bullets from head to toe. There is no doubt that an entire apparatus of fear dissemination worked to convince India that the Sikhs were to be distrusted. And by and large, it succeeded,&quot; adding that &quot;Compromises with press freedom were accompanied by draconian legislation that was a target of criticism from human rights communities around the world.&quot;

According to a journalist traveling with Bhindranwale during 1982, the Central intelligence department, or CID, which had taped every public speech listening for &quot;seditious&quot; remarks, had heard none by April 1982, and Darbara Singh, despite being ready to &quot;act&quot; against Bhindranwale, had found no grounds to do so.

==Insurgency==
When the insurgency against the central government began, it was against the main backdrop of unresolved Anandpur Sahib Resolution claims and an increased sense of disillusionment with the democratic process, which when it worked seemed to end up with Sikhs’ not achieving satisfactory representation, and when it did not, ended up with the dictatorship of Emergency rule, as well as the backdrop of communal conflict on the subcontinent which gave Sikhs a historical justification to fear for the future of their religion in a Hindi-dominated state. The failure of the central government to address political, social, and economic problems of the Sikhs facilitated the rise of militancy. Sikh demands had been fundamentally political rather than religious, while prolonged intransigence by the central government on water, state border, and devolutionary issues, in addition to centralization, led to alienation and militancy. Bhindranwale accused Indira Gandhi of sending Darbara Singh, former Congress chief minister of Punjab, to &quot;wreak atrocities on the Sikh nation.&quot;

On 8 February 1984, the Akalis held a successful bandh to demonstrate their strength and continued commitment to non-violent struggle. The following week, a tripartite talk with five cabinet ministers, five Akali leaders, and fifteen leaders from opposition parties came close to a successful settlement, but was deliberately sabotaged once again by Bhajan Lal with more anti-Sikh violence in Haryana. This was followed by Akali to express frustration in further protests, leading to their arrest along with many volunteers. On 25 May 1984, Longowal announced another &quot;morcha&quot; to be initiated on 3 June, the day Operation Blue Star would be launched, practicing civil disobedience by refusing to pay land revenue, water or electricity bills, and block the flow of grain out of Punjab. Gandhi&#x27;s emissaries met Akali leaders on 27 May to once again suggest the negotiation of a settlement, but though the Akalis showed signs of yielding, Bhindranwale would accept nothing short of the full implementation of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution.

According to Gandhi&#x27;s principal secretary P. C. Alexander, it would be Longowal&#x27;s announcement of withholding Punjabi grain and tax from the central government that had been the true &quot;last straw&quot; for Gandhi to send the army when she did, as opposed to any militancy.

In the midst of the protests, police violence, and the burgeoning insurgency ensuing, it would be increasingly clear that the government would seek a military rather than a political solution to the unrest in Punjab, and Bhindranwale would instruct the people to be prepared for a showdown with the government. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale had with himself a group of devoted followers armed with firearms who served as his bodyguards and acolytes, occasionally as willing and unpaid assassins. Bhindranwale urged all Sikhs to buy weapons and motorcycles, which would be helpful to fight state oppression, instead of spending on television sets. He believed that &quot;amritdharis&quot; (baptized Sikhs) should also be &quot;shastradharis&quot; (weapon bearers), as had been required by Guru Gobind Singh for defensive purposes. Bhindranwale and Amrik Singh started carrying firearms at all times, hearkening to the Sikh religious duty of carrying a kirpan, which is also a weapon, and police brutality on Sikh protesters. Upon the imposition of President&#x27;s rule and the designation of Punjab as a disturbed area, the police were given broad powers to search, arrest, and shoot whom they would, immune from legal action.

Bhindranwale&#x27;s call to Sikhs to keep weapons was, “For every village you should keep one motorcycle, three young baptized Sikhs and three revolvers. These are not meant for killing innocent people. For a Sikh to have arms and kill an innocent person is a serious sin. But Khalsaji for Sikh to have weapons and not to get their legitimate rights is a greater sin.” Indira Gandhi began to use the term &quot;extremists,&quot; a term meant to push Punjab back into line with the government, Sikhs were relieved of duty from police and military forces in large numbers. Sikhs in government positions were profiled by police across India from the 1970s to the 1990s, who arrested and tortured suspected criminals at will.

On 12 May 1984, Ramesh Chander, son of Lala Jagat Narain and editor of Hind Samachar group was alleged by Kuldip Nayar to have been murdered by &quot;supporters&quot; of Bhindranwale. Lala&#x27;s paper had had a &quot;shrill tone when reporting on Sikh issues,&quot; and &quot;was widely dubbed pro-Hindu,&quot; with its &quot;tone&quot; changing only subsequently. In 1989, seven editors and seven news hawkers and newsagents were assassinated. Punjab Police had to provide protection to the entire distribution staff and scenes of armed policemen escorting news hawkers on their morning rounds became common.

According to KPS Gill, a few Sikh leaders raised their voice against Bhindranwale&#x27;s presence in the Akal Takht complex. Giani Partap Singh, an eighty year old former Jathedar of the Akal Takht, had criticised Bhindranwale for the arsenal of modern weapons in the Akal Takht, and was shot at his home in Tahli Chowk, as were Niranjan Singh the Granthi of Gurdwara Toot Sahib, Granthi Jarnail Singh of Valtoha, and Granthi Surat Singh of Majauli. The police, reportedly on instructions from superiors, did not check the trucks used for &quot;kar sevā&quot; (religious service) that brought in supplies needed for the daily &quot;langar&quot;. During a random check, one truck was stopped and guns and ammunition were found.

Militant organizations would lose popular support by the late 1980s, years after Bhindranwale&#x27;s death, once their membership had begun to attract lumpen elements that joined the movements for the allure of money, rather than the long cherished cause of a separate homeland for the Sikhs. Separatists were accused by Indian authorities and critics for being responsible for crimes including assassination, bank robbery, home invasion, organising training camps, and stockpiling weapons.

The Babbar Khalsa were opposed to Bhindranwale and his initial strategy of opting to join the Akalis&#x27; protest movement for Punjab&#x27;s rights instead of immediately pursuing more militant means; it was more focused on propagating its view of Sikh religious life than on politics and states&#x27; rights, and contested with Bhindranwale for dominance of the movement. The rivalry intensified in April and May 1984, with the two groups blaming each other for several assassinations. Bhindranwale would subsequently be regarded as the head of the movement.

==Relocation to the Akal Takht==
In July 1982, at the start of the &quot;Dharam Yudh Morcha&quot;, the President of Shiromani Akali Dal, Harchand Singh Longowal had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence at the Golden Temple compound. He called Bhindranwale &quot;our stave to beat the government.&quot; On 19 July 1982, Bhindranwale took residence with approximately 200 armed followers in the Guru Nanak Niwas guest house, on the precincts of the Golden Temple. Bhindranwale developed a reputation as a man of principle who could settle people&#x27;s problems about land, property or any other matter without needless formality or delay, more expediently than the legal system. The judgement would be accepted by both parties and carried out. This added to his popularity. Bhindranwale led the campaign in Punjab from the complex guest house, from where he met and was interviewed by international television crews.
On 23 April 1983, the Punjab Police Deputy Inspector General A. S. Atwal was shot dead as he left the Harmandir Sahib compound by a gunman from one of the several groups residing there, in apparent revenge for police conduct. The assassination was never solved. The government promptly blamed militant groups, though all militant factions, as well as the Akalis, Bhindranwale, and the AISSF, all vehemently denied all accusations and unequivocally condemned the incident.

On the assassination, Longowal stated, &quot;Whenever the situation becomes ripe for settlement, some violent incident takes place. I think there is a government conspiracy behind the DIG&#x27;s murder.&quot; When asked who could be responsible, he implied Darbara Singh&#x27;s involvement: &quot;The one who is afraid of losing his seat (of power);&quot; observers had noted that Darbara Singh had been on the verge of being replaced by the Congress high command, partly on Akali request and partly due to ineptitude. Bhindranwale condemned it as &quot;the handiwork of the Punjab [Congress] government,&quot; and &quot;an attempt to foil the Akali agitation and to malign the Sikhs.&quot; The president of the AISSF termed the shooting &quot;anti-Sikh&quot; and carried out by certain elements in the Congress party, demanding a judicial inquiry.

The CRPF, a central paramilitary police force, had been deployed in Punjab during President&#x27;s rule as an alternative to the Punjab Police, who due to its mostly Jatt Sikh composition were seen with apprehension by the central government, which imposed a recruitment ban on it for a time. CRPF troops first fired on the Golden Temple in February 1984 following the Panipat riots the same month, furthering misgivings among Sikhs. The Punjab Police, traditionally seen as oppressive, were briefly seen by Sikhs as a counterbalance to the CRPF, even resulting in frayed relations and even a few clashes between the two forces, before the militancy would take off after Blue Star when it would again become the primary opposing force.
When J S Aurora had visited the Golden Temple with his wife in December 1983, while Bhindranwale was living in the Guru Nanak Niwas, and looked at various areas of the complex, he had noticed no defensive preparations anywhere. Visiting again on 24 February the next year, when Bhindranwale had moved to the Akal Takht building, he only saw sandbags on the &quot;langar&quot; complex which &quot;did not appear very formidable,&quot; which he was told was placed for protection after the CRPF had fired on the complex in February. He would visit again a month after the operation, attributing the professional defenses that had been built between March and June to Shabeg Singh who had served under him.

Reportedly, militants responsible for bombings and murders were taking shelter in some gurdwaras in Punjab. In turn, some members of the Congress-led Punjab assembly alleged that the murder in the temple premises confirmed the charges that the extremists were being sheltered and given active support in religious places and the Guru Nanak Niwas, and that Bhindranwale was openly supporting such elements. However, the central government would later claim that it could not enter the gurdwaras for the fear of hurting Sikh sentiments. After President&#x27;s rule was imposed in Punjab, the burning of a gurdwara at Churu, Rajasthan by the Jai Hindu Sangh on 26 November increased the violence, and on 14 February the Hindi Suraksha Samiti vandalized a train station by destroying a model of the Golden Temple and pictures of the Sikh gurus. Anti-Sikh mob violence in Haryana from 15 to 20 February 1984, mobilized by CM Bhajan Lal at the behest of leaders in Delhi, and the killing of eight Sikhs in Panipat on 19 February in view of the police station, provoked retaliations.

As the days went by the law and order situation further deteriorated and violence escalated. While the Akalis pressed on with their two-pronged strategy of negotiations and massive campaigns of civil disobedience directed at the Central Government, others were not so enamoured of nonviolence. Communists known as &quot;Naxalites&quot;, and armed Sikh groups – the &quot;Babbar Khalsa&quot; and &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot;, both of which opposed Bhindranwale, sometimes worked hand in hand and clashed with the police. A covert government group known as the Third Agency was also engaged in dividing and destabilising the Sikh movement through the use of undercover officers, paid informants and agents provocateurs. Bhindranwale himself always kept a revolver and wore a cartridge belt and encouraged his followers to be armed. However, a Chandigarh officer in an interview with the December 1983 issue of &quot;India Today&quot; explained that the worst offense Bhindranwale could be accused of was &quot;harsh speech rhetoric.&quot;

The earliest demands for army intervention, under the guise of terms like &quot;martial law,&quot; &quot;army rule,&quot; &quot;army takeover, and &quot;imposition of Emergency,&quot; were made by organizations like the RSS, Hindi Suraksha Samiti, and the BJP. Later joined by other outwardly secular parties, the Congress would seek to consolidate its vote bank along communal lines. During the debate in the Parliament of India members of both the houses demanded the arrest of Bhindranwale. Sensing a prospect of his arrest from the hostel premises, he convinced the SGPC president Tohra to set up his headquarters on the Akal Takht complex. While the move was supported by Gurcharan Singh Tohra, an Akali who was then President of the SGPC, it was opposed by Harchand Singh Longowal, leader of the Akali political party. On 15 December 1983, Bhindranwale was asked to move out of Guru Nanak Niwas house by members of the Babbar Khalsa who acted with Longowal&#x27;s support. Longowal by now feared for his own safety. Tohra then convinced the high priest to allow Bhindranwale to reside in Akal Takht. On 15 December 1983, Bhindranwale and his supporters moved to the Akal Takht complex and began fortifying the complex with sand bags and light weaponry. Longowal attempted to block the move by persuading Giani Kirpal Singh, then Jathedar (head priest) of the Akal Takht, to use his authority and issue a Hukamnama (edict) disallowing Bhindranwale from relocating to the complex. The temple high priest protested this move as a sacrilege since no Guru or leader ever resided in Akal Takht that too on the floor above Granth Sahib but Tohra agreed to prevent Bhindranwale&#x27;s arrest, In the end, while Giani Kirpal Singh did protest the move, Bhindranwale&#x27;s was permitted to relocate. as Bhindranwale believed that the Morcha leader Longowal was negotiating with the government for his arrest. By December 1983, Bhindranwale and his followers, now joined by senior ex-military personnel like Major general Shabeg Singh, retired Major General J.S. Bhullar, retired Brigadier Mohinder Singh, and others, had made the Golden Temple complex an armoury and headquarters, fortifying it with sandbags in preparation for a siege. Mark Tully and Satish Jacob wrote, &quot;All terrorists were known by name to the shopkeepers and the householders who live in the narrow alleys surrounding the Golden Temple... the Punjab police must have known who they were also, but they made no attempt to arrest them. By this time Bhindranwale and his men were above the law.&quot; However, Bhindranwale presented himself, along with over 50 of his supporters, at the Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s residence on the day he moved to the Darbar Sahib complex, revealing his purpose in moving there was not to hide from the law, as the District Magistrate at Amritsar, until shortly before the invasion, was on record as having assured the Governor of the state that he could arrest anyone in Darbar Sahib at any time, though not seeing a need to.

After Blue Star, Lieutenant general J S Aurora commented on the lack of sophisticated weapons, mentioning a number of light machine guns and two rocket launchers, but the lack of medium machine guns or mortars, with the only weapons bearing foreign markings being 60 self-loading rifles. He would ascribe most of the weaponry to either simply having been picked up from misplaced weapons drops during border wars, issued by the government to people living close to the border for security purposes, government gun-running, or from Punjab&#x27;s long-established rural trade of unaccounted guns, used in family feuds, property disputes, dacoit bands and the like. Describing the weaponry seized after the operation, he stated, &quot;Quite a lot, yes, but the impression that has been built up in the public mind of foreign governments deliberately arming the terrorists with a view to overthrowing the government is grossly overdone.&quot;

==Views on Khalistan==
Bhindranwale was not an outspoken supporter of Khalistan, although he often emphasized the separate identity of the Sikhs. Bhindranwale stated his position on Khalistan, a movement which was first introduced in concept during the 1946 independence negotiations. During interviews with domestic and foreign journalists and public speeches through his phrase that &quot;Sikh ik vakhri qaum hai&quot; (or, &quot;Sikhism is a distinct nation&quot;), using the word &#x27;Qaum&#x27; (nation, people, or also religion) when referring to the Sikh population of Punjab, though others have argued that &quot;national&quot; is a mistranslation of &#x27;qaum,&#x27; as India was a nation of various races and &#x27;qaums.&#x27; In a speech given by Bhindranwale on 27 March 1983:

While Bhindranwale never explicitly supported Khalistan, in a BBC interview, he stated that if the government agreed to the creation of such a state, he would not refuse and repeat the mistakes made by Sikh leadership during the 1946 independence: “How can a nation which has sacrificed so much for the freedom of the country want it fragmented but I shall definitely say that we are not in favor of Khalistan nor are we against it.” adding that the Sikhs would opt for a separate state only if they were discriminated against and were not respected in India, or if their distinct Sikh identity was in any way threatened. In regards to the idea of the Indian government attacking the Darbar Sahib, he stated, &quot;if the Indian Government invaded the Darbar Sahib complex, the foundation for an independent Sikh state will have been laid.&quot;

In his final interview to Subhash Kirpekar, Bhindranwale stated that &quot;Sikhs can neither live in India nor with India. If treated as equals it may be possible. But frankly speaking I don&#x27;t think that is possible.&quot; Kuldip Brar, who would later head Operation Blue Star, would subsequently put forth that per the Indian intelligence sources in early June 1984, there was a &quot;strong feeling&quot; and &quot;some sort of information&quot; among the government that Bhindranwale was supposedly planning to declare Khalistan an independent country any moment with support from Pakistan, that Khalistani currency had allegedly already been distributed, and that this declaration would have increased chances of Punjab Police and security personnel siding with Bhindranwale.

In later disclosures from former R&amp;AW special secretary G.B.S. Sidhu, R&amp;AW itself helped &quot;build the Khalistan legend,&quot; actively participated in the planning of Operation Blue Star. While posted in Ottawa, Canada in 1976 to look into the &quot;Khalistan problem&quot; among the Sikh diaspora, Sidhu found &quot;nothing amiss&quot; during the three years he was there, stating that &quot;Delhi was unnecessarily making a mountain of a molehill where none existed,&quot; that the agency created seven posts in West Europe and North America in 1981 to counter non-existent Khalistan activities, and that the deployed officers were &quot;not always familiar with the Sikhs or the Punjab issue.&quot; Describing the secessionist movement as a &quot;chimera&quot; until the attack on the Darbar Sahib, after which the insurgency would start, he would later contend that:

According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article written just a few weeks after the operation:

Khushwant Singh had written that &quot;considerable Khalistan sentiment seems to have arisen since the raid on the temple, which many Sikhs, if not most, have taken as a deep offense to their religion and their sensibilities,&quot; referring to the drastic change in community sentiments after the army attack.

===Negotiations===
Amarinder Singh, who had a close relationship with Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi, met with Bhindranwale on behalf of the government in 1982, serving as an MP in the Lok Sabha at the time. After abortive attempts to set up meetings between Bhindranwale and Indira Gandhi in Punjab and Delhi, as neither was willing to leave their territories, Amarinder Singh, on Bhindranwale&#x27;s request, was able to arrange a meeting between Bhindranwale and Rajiv Gandhi in Punjab, also a Congress MP at the time who agreed to meet. Two meetings were planned, though neither took place as Rajiv failed to appear both times; both Amarinder and Rajiv had been summoned back by Indira each time as they were about to embark from Safdarjung Airport in Delhi. Amarinder believes that intelligence agencies induced Indira to interfere in the occurrence of both meetings.

Amarinder nevertheless continued efforts to keep negotiations with other parties going, often flying from Delhi to Punjab in a series of what the government called &quot;secret talks&quot; to continue to meet Bhindranwale and Longowal on various occasions, right up until the army operation. His 2017 autobiography states that:

On Bhindranwale&#x27;s objectives, Amarinder states,

During the days before the assault, government representatives, led by Ambassador Daljit Singh Pannun, met with Bhindranwale in a last-ditch effort to avert the army operation, which Bhindranwale had agreed to initiate dialogue toward. Bhindranwale sought a commitment from Pannun that Sikh youths taken in captivity during the protest movement would no longer be tortured by police. He also sought comment from Gandhi stating that all the problems afflicting the state of Punjab would be resolved through mutual discussion; Pannun offered a window of one month to await comment while Bhindranwale offered one week; the parties settled on a window of ten days, during which Bhindranwale and his men would disarm. Bhindranwale warned of a backlash by the Sikh community in the event of an army assault on the Golden Temple, if the plan was sabotaged, and wanted assurance that if any mishap took place, that Gandhi would not blame his men. The documentation of the reports sent to the central government before Operation Blue Star reads, “We ended this meeting in utmost cordiality and understanding and were happy at the outcome. In fact, I found there was nothing that would frighten the government of India, nor anyone else.” Pannun asserted that Bhindranwale had repeatedly told him that he did not want Khalistan, that Bhindranwale was “grossly misunderstood,” and that had Pannun been treated with honesty and consideration (as he had been &quot;kept in the dark about the impending army operation by vested interests&quot;), Operation Blue Star would have never taken place, and &quot;many innocent lives could have been saved.&quot; The comment awaited from Gandhi would never come.

On the 30th anniversary of the operation, journalist Rajinder Puri disclosed that the &quot;fundamental truth&quot; of the operation being &quot;deliberately or otherwise ignored&quot; was the fact that it had been unnecessary because Bhindranwale had categorically agreed to a settlement acceptable to both the government and to Longowal exactly one month prior. Puri had personally met Bhindranwale, approached by fellow journalist Jatindra Tuli on behalf of Rajiv Gandhi for help in achieving a settlement with Bhindranwale, describing this as &quot;not a new disclosure&quot; but one that had been subsequently ignored. Puri met Rajiv Gandhi in the residence of Romi Chopra and consented to help, and through his brother General Prikshat Puri, contacted Bhindranwale&#x27;s elder brother Captain Harcharan Singh Rode, decorated for valour in the 1965 war, who served under General Puri.

Agreeing to cooperate, Rode escorted Rajinder Puri from Rode&#x27;s post in Jalandhar to Amritsar to meet Bhindranwale, where Bhindranwale was assured through Rode that Puri spoke for the government. During the course of the hour-long conversation, Bhindranwale agreed to abide with the terms of a settlement to be discussed between Puri and Longowal, also housed in the temple complex, and asked Bhindranwale to confine himself to Sikh spiritual and religious matters, which Bhindranwale also agreed to. Puri also asked him directly if he wanted Khalistan, and relayed that &quot;[Bhindranwale] had never demanded Khalistan but if it was offered to him on a plate he would not reject it.&quot; Puri and Longowal would then agree to a settlement were &quot;unexceptionable and acceptable to the government&quot;, and Puri would inform Chopra of the success and to inform Gandhi, who, however, never got back to Puri even after multiple contact attempts, leaving Puri with a &quot;lasting impression&quot; of Gandhi which was &quot;very poor&quot;. He had also gotten word that a former MP from Amritsar, R.L. Bhatia, had also obtained assurances from Bhindranwale.

Puri would write that &quot;all the arguments about why Operation Bluestar became necessary need to be nailed&quot;:

In addition to Capt. Harcharan Singh Rode, another of Bhindranwale&#x27;s elder brothers, Harjit Singh Rode, has also said that Bhindranwale had never demanded Khalistan, saying that he had wished for &quot;no more and no less&quot; than the full implementation of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, a demand that the central government had &quot;overlooked&quot; as it mischaracterized his position.

Indian politician Subramanian Swamy met Bhindranwale multiple times, stayed with him for several days, and closely observed the developments in Punjab during the 1990s. Swamy himself referred to Bhindranwale as a &quot;Sant&quot; and &quot;short tempered person&quot;. He has remained adamant that Bhindranwale had never demanded Khalistan, and that the USSR was the main force behind the disinformation campaign that would lead to Operation Blue Star, aided by state politicians like Harkishan Singh Surjeet of the CPI, who according to Swamy had conveyed a message to the USSR warning that increased Sikh religiosity in Punjab would cause the decline of Communist politics in the state. Swamy contends that the USSR sought to make India more dependent on them against Pakistan as it expanded southward from its position in Afghanistan at the time. Later disclosures from declassified Soviet documents would confirm the role that the Soviets had played in feeding Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, her perceived successor, misinformation about a secessionist movement supposedly being fomented by foreign entities:

The forged document was presented to Gandhi on 13 May 1982. Later that year Yuri Andropov, shortly after becoming the leader of the USSR, approved a proposal by KGB head Vladimir Kryuchkov to fabricate further Pakistani intelligence documents detailing ISI plans to foment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan as an independent Sikh state, to be passed to the Indian ambassador in Pakistan. The KGB appeared by now &quot;supremely confident that it could continue to deceive her indefinitely with fabricated reports of CIA and Pakistani conspiracies against her,&quot; and would go on to successfully persuade Rajiv Gandhi, presumed to be Indira Gandhi&#x27;s successor by 1983, of CIA subversion in Punjab, as the Dharam Yudh Morcha continued, and the USSR, like the CPI, &quot;quickly expressed full understanding of the steps taken by the Indian government to curb terrorism&quot; when she ordered Operation Blue Star, and &quot;once again, Mrs. Gandhi took seriously Soviet claims of secret CIA support for the Sikhs.&quot;

On the KGB role in facilitating the operation, Swamy would state in 1992, &quot;The 1984 Operation Blue Star became necessary because of the vast disinformation against Sant Bhindranwale by the KGB, and repeated inside Parliament by the Congress Party of India.&quot; Calling Bhindranwale a friend, and referring to his frequent press conferences and open meetings with dignitaries, he has controversially always refused to term him a terrorist, saying that &quot;only declassification of files can uncover the truth.&quot;

==Government maneuvers==
The planning for Operation Blue Star was initiated long before Bhindranwale had relocated to the complex in December 1983 and begun to fortify it running sand-model exercises for the attack on a Golden Temple replica in the Doon Valley over 18 months prior, and over 125 other Sikh shrines were simultaneously attacked. According to Gen. S.K. Sinha, it had not been a last resort, but on Gandhi&#x27;s mind since after the 1982 Akali agitations. During publicly recorded speeches in May and July in 1983 (still several months before relocating to the Akal Takht and initiating efforts to fortify it) Bhindranwale warned that senior officers of the CID were planning to initially occupy Taksal and Nihang camps of Mehta, and gradually take control of the Golden Temple. A previous request to solicit the use of army personnel and tanks had been made by Chief Minister Darbara Singh and Prime Minister Gandhi to aid in the arrest of Bhindranwale at Mehta Chowk in 1982. However, then military commander Lt. Gen. S.K. Sinha, a &quot;dear friend&quot; of Major General Shabeg Singh, Bhindranwale&#x27;s military advisor, viewed the request as &quot;very strange&quot; and advised against the use of military force considering the sanctity of the complex and potential repercussions. While Bhindranwale surrendered peacefully at Mehta Chowk, Sinha would opt for early retirement when the same request came again two years later for him to deploy tanks and army personnel to conduct Operation Blue Star, and what he advised against, his replacements Gen. A. S. Vaidya (selected by Gandhi to supersede Sinha) and Lt. Gen. Krishnaswamy Sundarji did &quot;gladly.&quot;

On 14 April 1984 Surinder Singh Sodhi was killed while drinking tea in a shop in Amritsar by Surinder Singh Shinda and Baljit Kaur. Baljit Kaur had attempted to assassinate Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale on April 13, but backed out. Baljit Kaur, would go to the Golden Temple after the killing and confessed to the murder. Baljit Kaur would be interrogated by Bhidnranwale. She would admit to the other killer being her boyfriend Surinder Singh Shinda and to being paid 200,000 rupees (3.1 million rupees in 2023. 37,500 USD in 2023.) by Gurcharan Singh, the general secretary of Akali Dal led by Harchand Singh Longowal, to do the killing. She also implicated others. Bhindranwale in a speech would say, &quot;They (Akali Dal) killed our young men. They severed my right arm... I know what role that... played in seeking vergency for the martyrs&quot;. Bhindranwale and his men killed multiple responsible. He put a signboard up in view of Longowal&#x27;s office saying, &quot;Sodhi&#x27;s murder avenged within 48 hours. The other conspirators should look after themselves now.&quot; Longowal feared that he would be killed and managed to have Babbar Khalsa side with him. 130 Akali leaders and 40 SGPC members revolted against Longowal and sided with Bhindranwale. With this Akali Dal under Longowal and Indira Gandhi agreed they had to &#x27;neutralize&#x27; Bhindranwale.

The government made elaborate plans for an army action while feigning readiness for negotiations and denying any intention of sending armed forces inside the Darbar Sahib complex. Six additional divisions of the army including especially trained para commandos were inducted into Punjab by the end of May 1984. The government sent a team led by Narasimha Rao, which proved unsuccessful, as Bhindranwale&#x27;s firm position was nothing short of full implementation of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, rejecting, for instance, the offer to give Chandigarh to Punjab in exchange for areas of southwestern Punjab state, as Chandigarh had been promised exclusively to Punjab in a formal communication issued by the Union government on January 29, 1970. The Sikhs would ultimately withdraw, believing they had seen a commando unit move into the city. Indira Gandhi tried to persuade the Akalis to support her in the arrest of Bhindranwale. These talks ended up being futile. On 26 May, Tohra informed the government that he had failed to convince Bhindranwale and that Bhindranwale was not under anyone&#x27;s control. As Gandhi had no intention of implementing the Anandpur Sahib Resolution and feared the loss of Hindu electoral support, and as the Akali Dal also feared losing power, as over 40 SGPC members and 130 Akali leaders, including former legislators, had revolted against Longowal&#x27;s leadership in favor of Bhindranwale, Akali Dal and central government interests had finally converged. Faced with imminent army action and with Longowal abandoning him, Bhindranwale declared &quot;This bird is alone. There are many hunters after it&quot;.

Army action in the Punjab, which had been discussed in December 1983 to consolidate Hindu votes for Congress, began on 3 June, the day of Longowal&#x27;s planned &quot;morcha&quot;. Punjab&#x27;s borders were sealed off and intrastate movement was disabled by the troop presence, with the water and electricity supply to the Golden Temple cut off. Exploratory fire was attempted on 4 June, with army commandos and CS gas proving ineffective on 5 June. The use of tanks on the complex began on 6 June, with tanks, helicopters, and other means used to deter the thousands of upset villagers attempting to gather in Amritsar, along with any other attempted gathering at over 125 other gurdwaras which had been taken over preemptively by the state. The main action was concluded by 6 June, in which a large number of pilgrims, including women and children, had been killed, and young men shot, by incensed troops who had entered the complex, with their hands tied back with their own turbans, with others dying of suffocation in the guest rooms set up as detainment camps. The operation resulted in 700 army casualties and 5,000 civilian deaths.

Chandan Mitra wrote after observing the insurgency:
==Death==
In June 1984, after the negotiations, Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Operation Blue Star, an Indian Army operation carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984, to remove Bhindranwale and his armed militants from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex in Amritsar, Punjab. Bhindranwale was killed in the operation. Army officers and soldiers commented on &#x27;the courage and commitment&#x27; of the followers of Bhindranwale who died in action.

According to Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, who commanded the operation, the body of Bhindranwale was identified by a number of agencies, including the police, the Intelligence Bureau and militants in the Army&#x27;s custody. Bhindranwale&#x27;s brother also identified Bhindranwale&#x27;s body. Pictures of what appear to be Bhindranwale&#x27;s body have been published in at least two widely circulated books, &quot;Tragedy of Punjab: Operation Bluestar and After&quot; and &quot;Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi&#x27;s Last Battle&quot;. BBC correspondent Mark Tully also reported seeing Bhindranwale&#x27;s body during his funeral.

In 2016, &quot;The Week&quot; quoted former members of the confidential Special Group (SG) of India&#x27;s Research and Analysis Wing as stating that SG had killed Bhindranwale using AK-47 rifles during Operation Blue Star, despite the Para SF claiming responsibility for it.

== Views and attacks on Hindus ==
After Bhindranwale was arrested on suspicion of his involvement in Lala Jagat Narain&#x27;s murder, three Sikhs fired at Hindus in a market in Jalandhar, killing four and injuring twelve others. The next day, a similar incident occurred in Taran Taran, killing one Hindu and injuring thirteen others. According to &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies&quot;, bands of young Sikhs began indiscriminately killing Hindus in response to Bhindranwale&#x27;s arrest.

By 1982, Bhindranwale&#x27;s campaign to stroke tensions among Sikhs and Hindus was underway; a particular tactic employed by Sikh militants was to throw the heads or other body parts of cows into temples. Bhindranwale hoped his campaign of instilling fear and intimidation within Hindus would provoke their mass flight from Punjab, and vice versa, embolden Hindus to retaliate against Sikhs outside the state, forcing Sikhs to seek refuge in Punjab, and hence vitiate their links with the rest of India.

Mark Tully and Satish Jacob report that as Bhindranwale&#x27;s influence within Punjab grew, legends surrounding Bhindranwale&#x27;s hit list began to circulate. While they describe certain stories vis-à-vis the hit-list as exaggerations or myths, they assert that Bhindranwale&#x27;s hit-list did exist. Recounting an incident in which a woman pleaded to Bhindranwale to eliminate her husband, Bhindranwale refused, reportedly stating: &quot;I only finish those who are enemies of the Sikh faith like policeman, government officials, and Hindus.&quot; Hindus were particularly angered when Bhindranwale labelled Hindus as &quot;spindle-legged cowards&quot; and when his hit squads targeted Punjabi Hindus.

Bhindranwale and his cohort regularly delivered anti-Hindu slogans, speeches and songs at the Golden Temple. Hoping to maintain the religious fervour among his followers by pitting them against certain enemies, Bhindranwale targeted the Hindu community. By September 1983, various attacks against Hindus began. On 28 September 1983 in Jagraon, Sikh militants shot indiscriminately at Hindus out on their morning walk. On 5 October 1983, Sikh militants targeted a bus in the Kapurthala district, and shot the Hindu passengers on board. The following month, another bus was targeted. During 1983, many bombings of Hindu temples and congregations, as well as the sabotage of rail lines that caused deadly train accidents took place. Bhindranwale&#x27;s incitements to violence were followed by a wave of terror activity in Punjab. Between September 1981 and April 1983, there were nearly one hundred incidents of Sikh militants murdering Nirankaris, minor government officials, and bomb explosions.

Throughout February 1984, incidents including raids on Hindu temples, bank robberies, militants firing indiscriminately against the police, and indiscriminate firings at Hindus were reported on a daily basis. Shortly after, a bomb was thrown in a Hindu temple by a Sikh suspect.

By April 1984, Sikh militants had spread throughout Punjab&#x27;s countryside, largely due to Bhindranwale&#x27;s injunctions for Sikhs to arm themselves and attack enemies of the faith. On 26 April 1984, Sikh motorcyclists shot a Hindu commission agent in Bhikiwind and a Hindu shopkeeper in Samadh Bhai. At this point, Bhindranwale&#x27;s plan to trigger a Hindu exodus was coming into fruition as many Hindus had fled Punjab. Fear among Punjabi Hindus drove them to adopt Sikh garb, Hindus who travelled by bus were frequent targets of Sikh militants and began growing beards and wearing turbans.According to the Indian government&#x27;s figures, Bhindranwale&#x27;s militants had killed 165 Hindus and 39 Sikhs between August 1982 and June 1984. According to an April 1984 &quot;Washington Post&quot; report, more than 100 people were killed in Punjab between mid-February and April 1984, and more than 300 people died in Sikh-Hindu violence in the past 20 months.

== Legacy ==
Cynthia Keppley Mahmood states that &quot;Largely responsible for launching Sikh militancy, he is valorized by militants and demonised by enemies and the accounts from the two divergent sources seem to refer to two completely different persons.&quot;

Though journalist Khushwant Singh was opposed to Bhindranwale, he allowed that the Sikh preacher-become-activist genuinely made no distinction between higher and lower castes, and that he had restored thousands of drunken or doped Sikh men, inured to pornographic films, to their families, and that Operation Blue Star had given the movement for Khalistan its first martyr in Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In 2003, at a function arranged by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, at Akal Takht Amritsar under the vision of president SGPC Prof. Kirpal Singh Badungar and Singh Sahib Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti, former &quot;jathedar&quot; of the Akal Takht made a formal declaration that Bhindranwale was a &quot;martyr&quot; and awarded his son, Ishar Singh, a robe of honour.

===In popular culture===

A movie named &quot;Dharam Yudh Morcha&quot;, released in 2016, was based on Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, mostly depicting the Sikhs&#x27; struggle for preserving Punjabi language and the Anandpur Sahib resolution. Though the movie was banned to avoid controversy, it is available on online platforms.

<text>The Canada warbler (Cardellina canadensis) is a small boreal songbird of the New World warbler family (Parulidae). It summers in Canada and northeastern United States and winters in northern South America.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Canada warbler in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name &quot;Le gobe-mouche cendré de Canada&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Muscicapa Canadensis Cinerea&quot;. Although Brissn coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Canada warbler. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa canadensis,&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Cardellina&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. The species is monotypic.

==Description==
The Canada warbler is sometimes called the &quot;necklaced warbler&quot;, because of the band of dark streaks across its chest. The adults have minimal sexual dimorphism, although the male&#x27;s &quot;necklace&quot; is darker and more conspicuous and also has a longer tail. Adults are long, have a wingspan of , and weigh .

The chest, throat, and belly of the bird are yellow, and its back is dark grey. It has no wingbars or tail spots, but the underside of the tail is white. It has a yellow line in front of its eye in the direction of the beak, but the most striking facial feature is the white eyerings or &quot;spectacles&quot;. Immature specimens have similar coloration as adults but duller and with less pronounced facial features.

===Song===
The of this bird is loud and highly variable, resembling &quot;chip chewy sweet dichetty&quot;. Their calls are low &quot;chup&quot;&#x27;s.

A 2013 study showed that male Canada warblers have two performance-encoded song types. Mode I, used mostly during the day, when unpaired either alone or near a female during early nesting, involves stereotyped songs sung slowly and regularly. Mode II, used at dawn, after pairing and when near another male, involves variable songs, sung rapidly with irregular rhythm and chirping between songs. Most of the phrases used were common to both modes, a feature unique among parulids, which ordinarily have an individual&#x27;s repertoire separated into two distinct parts.

In 2000, a female Canada warbler (or a post-hatching year-old male that failed to moult, something never before observed) in Giles County, Virginia was observed singing. Its repertoire consisted of a repeated song of 12 to 13 notes as well as several shorter songs consisting of the first five or six notes of the longer song. The bird did not respond to the playback of its own song or a recording of a male. Although female singing among the parulids has long been considered &quot;idiosyncratic&quot;, singing by female Canada warblers is supported by the observation of female singing in congener Wilson&#x27;s warbler and the closely related hooded warbler.

==Distribution and habitat==
During the breeding season 82% of the population can be found in Canada and 18% in the United States. In Canada, the summer range extends from southeastern Yukon to Nova Scotia. In the United States, the range extends from northern Minnesota to northern Pennsylvania, east to Long Island, New York. It also nests in the high Appalachians as far south as Georgia. In winter, the Canada warbler&#x27;s range extends from Guyana to northwestern Bolivia around the northern and western side of the Andean crest.

In both summer and winter seasons, the Canada warbler inhabits moist thickets. During the breeding season, the bird &quot;nests in riparian thickets, brushy ravines, forest bogs, etc. at a wide range of elevations and across a variety of forest types. In the northwestern parts of its range, it frequents aspen forests; in the center of the range, it is found in forested wetlands and swamps; and in the south, it occupies montane rhododendron thickets.&quot;
In the winter, it prefers mid- and upper-elevation habitats. In northern Minnesota, a study found that Canada warblers inhabited the shrub-forest edge, rather than mature forests or open fields with shrub. In New England, the Canada warbler was found to be &quot;disturbance specialists&quot; moving into patches of forests recovering from wind throw or timber removal. Because of its preference for low-height foraging in deciduous forests, it may be bounded at higher elevations as suitable habitat disappears and it suffers competition from the black-throated blue warbler which prefers similar habitats.

Two accidentals have been observed in Europe. The first, a moribund male was caught in Sandgerði, Iceland on September 29, 1973. The second was a first winter, probably female observed for five days in October 2006 in County Clare, Ireland.

===Migration===
The Canada warbler is one of the last birds to arrive at the breeding grounds and one of the first to leave. They may spend only two months there. They fly at night along a route generally south and west to the Texas coast, then to southern Mexico. The arrive at the winter grounds in northwestern South America in late September to early October.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===
At least 60–65% of the population nests in boreal forests in Canada, the Great Lakes region of the United States, New England and through the Appalachians. The birds are at least seasonally monogamous. Sightings of pairs during migration in Panama have led to the conclusion that they are permanently monogamous. This conclusion, however, is contradicted by the sexes&#x27; wintering at different elevations.

Males arrive at the breeding grounds in the first two weeks of May. Females build the nests on or very close to the ground in dense cover. The nests are made up of root masses, hummocks, stumps, stream banks, mossy logs, and sometimes leaf litter and grass clumps. Moss covering is frequent.

The female lays four to five eggs and incubates for about 12 days. The chicks remain in the nest for about 10 days after hatching and are dependent on their parents for two to three weeks after they leave the nest.

The age at which the young leave the nest is not known. Once independent they spend almost all their time in the understory, on the ground or in bushes. The post-juvenile bird undergoes a partial moult involving all body feathers and wing coverlets. This may be completed before the first migration.

The oldest known specimen was a male found in Quebec in 1982 at least 8 years old, having been banded in 1975.

===Food and feeding===
The Canada warbler eats insects for the most part, including beetles, mosquitoes, flies, moths, and smooth caterpillars such as cankerworms, supplemented by spiders, snails, worms, and, at least seasonally, fruit. It employs several foraging tactics, such as flushing insects from foliage and catching them on the wing (which it does more frequently than other warblers), and searching upon the ground among fallen leaves. When they occasionally hover glean, males tend to fly higher than females on breeding grounds. In the tropics of South America, it forages in mixed flocks with other birds, usually 3–30 feet above ground in denser foliage.

==Diseases and parasites==
In the summer of 1947 a single specimen of Canada warbler from Virginia (and one specimen of another warbler from Georgia) were found to be hosts of a new species of acanthocephalan worm, which was named &quot;Apororhynchus amphistomi,&quot; the third species of that genus and the first in North America. In the southern part of the breeding range, nest parasitism by cowbirds is frequent.

==Status==
Partners in Flight estimates a global population of 4 million, while the American Bird Conservancy estimates that 1.5 million individuals exist.

Threats to the Canada warbler include forest fragmentation; over-browsing of the understory by deer, acid rain, and the spread of the woolly adelgid (a killer of fir and hemlock trees). Owing to these factors the Breeding Bird Survey data show a population decline of 3.2 percent per year throughout the Canada warbler&#x27;s breeding range, with the greatest declines in the Northeast. The species has been assessed as &quot;threatened&quot; by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. The IUCN, however, ranks the Canada warbler as a species of least concern.

The Canada warbler is protected at the federal level in both Canada and the United States.

==In art==

John James Audubon illustrates the Canada warbler in &quot;Birds of America&quot; (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 73 entitled &quot;Bonaparte&#x27;s Flycatching-Warbler—&quot;Muscicapa bonapartii&quot;.&quot; The single female (now properly identified as a Canada warbler) is shown perched on a great magnolia (&quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot;) branch that was painted by Joseph Mason. The final, combined image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell Jr. at the Havell workshops in London. The original painting was purchased by the New York Historical Society.

<doc id="441754" wikidata="Q672776" url="?curid=441754" title="Mosel (wine region)">
<text>Mosel () is one of 13 German wine regions (&quot;Weinbaugebiete&quot;) for quality wines (&quot;Qualitätswein&quot;, formerly &quot;QbA&quot; and &quot;Prädikatswein&quot;), and takes its name from the Mosel River (; Luxembourgish: &quot;Musel&quot;). Before 1 August 2007 the region was called Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, but changed to a name that was considered more consumer-friendly. The wine region is Germany&#x27;s third largest in terms of production but some consider it the leading region in terms of international prestige. 

The region covers the valleys of the rivers Mosel, Saar, and Ruwer from near the mouth of the Mosel at Koblenz and upstream to the vicinity of Trier in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The area is known for the steep slopes of the region&#x27;s vineyards overlooking the river. At 65° degrees incline, the steepest recorded vineyard in the world is the &quot;Calmont&quot; vineyard located on the Mosel and belonging to the village of Bremm, and therefore referred to as &quot;Bremmer Calmont&quot;. The Mosel is mainly famous for its wines made from the Riesling grape, but Elbling and Müller-Thurgau also contribute to the production, among others. 

In the past two decades red wine production, especially from the &quot;Spätburgunder&quot; (Pinot noir), has increased in the Mosel and throughout the German wine-growing regions and has become of increasing interest to the international wine community. Because of the northerly location of the Mosel, the Riesling wines are often light, tending to lower alcohol, crisp and high in acidity, and often exhibit &quot;flowery&quot; rather than or in addition to &quot;fruity&quot; aromas. Its most common vineyard soil is derived in the main from various kinds of slate deposits, which tend to give the wines a transparent, mineralic aspect, that often exhibit great depth of flavor. In the current era of climate change much work has been done to improve and gain acceptance for completely dry (&quot;Trocken&quot;) Rieslings in this region, so that most of the more famous makers have found acceptance for such wines, particularly in Europe.

==History==

It is believed that viticulture was brought to this area by the Romans who planted vineyards along the Mosel and the Rhine in order to have a local source of wine for their garrisons. The cost of transporting wine up from the Italian Peninsula or across the Vosges Mountains and the Roman vineyards in Gaul was very high and impractical. The Romans considered creating a canal between the Saône and the Rhine before ultimately deciding to plant vines in the area. Trier (founded 16 BC) was a major Roman outpost and it is likely that the first Mosel vineyards were planted in the surrounding hillsides sometime in the 2nd century. Viticulture was certainly flourishing in the area by the 4th century when the Roman poet Ausonius wrote a poem about the beauty of the land at harvest time.

The Mosel wine of the Roman period was described as light bodied and &quot;austere&quot;. It was said to be an easier drinking wine than that of other Roman areas. In the winter time, the wine was heated in a kettle and drunk like a tea (a practice that still has some tradition among modern vineyard workers who drink it like coffee, often with a little sugar added). In warmer vintages the wine was noticeably more fruity and sweet. This was because the warmth allowed the grapes to more fully ripen and develop more sugars. During the cold autumn the fermentation process would not be fully complete because of the low temperature, thus leaving the wine with high levels of residual sugars.
In the Middle Ages, villages sprung up that were centered on the region&#x27;s wine industry. These &quot;wine villages&quot;, known as &quot;Winzerdörfer&quot;, included paths from the town center up to the area&#x27;s vineyards. At the center was a community wine cellar where all the area&#x27;s growers could store their wines. Probably most well known among the &quot;Winzerdörfer&quot; was the village of Bernkastel which was granted town rights in 1291. In 1435 when Count Johann IV of Katzenelnbogen planted Riesling in the nearby town of Rüsselsheim the first time he owned vineyards in Winningen like &quot;the Destil&quot;, in Burgen and Kochem one half of the city and many vineyards more along the Mosel. In order to create more suitable land for vineyards, vineyard owners in the 16th century used explosives to break up the vertical spurs of rock along the rivers.

Towards the end of the 17th century, the Kunda began to be identified more with wine made from the Riesling grape. The St. Maximin&#x27;s Abbey in Trier owned 74 vineyards and by 1695 had over 100,000 Riesling vines. Today the vineyard of Maximin Grünhaus is considered one of the best Riesling vineyards in all of Germany. In the 18th century, the Prince-elector of Trier, Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, mandated that over a seven-year period every vine in the Mosel area was to be Riesling only. The rise of the House of Hanover in Great Britain saw a period of increase exportation of &quot;moselle wine&quot; to England. However, the wine&#x27;s high price kept the wines mostly in the hands of the Royal court and English nobility rather than replacing claret in the village taverns.

The 19th century saw an unprecedented era of prosperity for the Mosel wine industry under the rule of Prussia starting with the historic vintage of 1819. For the rest of the 1820s, there was a succession of outstanding weather and sterling wines produced. To promote the region&#x27;s wine, the Prussian government lowered the tariffs for the import of Mosel wines to other regions of the Prussian kingdom. The development of the Zollverein customs union even further benefited the Mosel by reducing the customs on their wines traveling to other regions of the German Confederation. A string of bad weather vintages in the late 1830s and early 1840s would dampen the extent of prosperity that the Mosel would see.

By the 1850s, wine-makers in the Mosel had discovered the benefits of chaptalization in helping to compensate for bad weather vintages and under ripened grapes. Another significant boom came a couple decades later when the British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone lowered the duties on light wine which opened up the British market to lower cost Mosel wines. This increased prosperity had the net effect of encouraging more quantity in production rather than quality. Many areas that were not ideal for Riesling were soon planted with the easier to grow Müller-Thurgau and other Riesling crossings. In the 20th century, a North American taste for sweet wines saw the prominence of Liebfraumilch and brands like Blue Nun dominate the German import wine market. In recent times, the Mosel (as well as the entire German wine industry) has dedicated itself to reversing the reputation it gained during these years and focus on the quality of the area&#x27;s dry wines.

==Climate and geography==

The Mosel wine region has northernly continental climate that is marked by cool temperatures. The best producing vineyard sites are located along the Mosel river and its tributary where the heat from the sun can be maximized by reflection up from the water. South and southwest facing slopes are even more sought after because of the increased exposure to direct sunlight that can aid in ripening of the grapes. The soil of the area is dominated by porous slate which has ideal drainage for the regions heavy rainfall and good heat retaining properties. Many of the best vineyards have no topsoil at all, just broken slate. During the summer months the weather is warm but rarely hot with July&#x27;s average temperatures around .

The Mosel river dominates the geography of the region which is typically divided into three main sections. The Upper Mosel is the southernmost section located closest to the river&#x27;s origins along the French and Luxembourg border. The region includes the Saar and Ruwer river tributaries and is centered on the city of Trier. The Middle Mosel or &quot;Mittelmosel&quot; is the main wine growing region and includes the villages of Bernkastel and Piesport. The Middle Mosel begins at the village of Zell and extends south to just north of the village of Schweich. The slate-based soil here is said to have one of the most recognizable &quot;terroir&quot; with the wines, especially Riesling, displaying slatey mineral notes. The Lower Mosel includes the region south of the city of Koblenz to the village of Alf near Zell. It is the most northern wine region of the Mosel and includes the area&#x27;s confluence with the Rhine river.

==Viticulture==

The steep river bank slopes that are scattered around the Mosel region are considered some of the most labor-intensive vineyards in the world. Mechanical harvesting is impractical and nearly seven times more man hours are needed in the Mosel than in flatter terrain such as the Médoc. Grapevines are individually staked to the ground without connecting wires so that vineyard workers can tend the plants going horizontally across the vineyard rather than vertically, which would be more treacherous and tiring. Safety is a priority for many Mosel vineyard owners with the area having a documented history of fatalities among workers while tending the vines. A benefit of the steep Mosel vineyards is that the incline allows for more direct sunlight to have contact with the vines. During the winter, rain often causes some soil erosion, especially of the vital slate chips that are needed for their heat retaining properties. Many vineyards will gather these eroded sediments and carry them back up the hillside.
The Riesling grape, grown on 59.7% of the region&#x27;s cultivated vineyard surface in 2008, is widely considered the most prestigious and highest quality wine grape of the Mosel but it cannot be planted on every vineyard site due to difficulties the grape has in ripening in particularly cool climates. Factors such as altitude, aspect and sunlight exposure can have a pronounced effect not only one the resulting quality of the wine but also whether the Riesling grape will even ripen at all. A positive characteristic of the Riesling grape is that despite less than perfect ripeness it can still create a wine of finesse and elegance that would escape most other grape varieties.

In place of Riesling, the easier cultivated Müller-Thurgau grape (14.7%) and other Riesling crossings like Kerner (4.6%) were planted in large quantities on the sites that were not suitable for Riesling, and which in many cases had been previously used for other agricultural purposes. A negative consequence of these large-scale plantings is that the wine produced from these sites are typically of a lower quality than Riesling wines which in turn has a depressing economic effect on the prices of all Mosel wines. While consumers have benefited with top quality Riesling wines being underpriced in comparison with some of the world&#x27;s other great wines from places like Bordeaux, Burgundy and California, the economic hardship created by the prices has caused some of the smaller Mosel vineyards to go out of business.

In 2008, the Mosel vineyards covered , making it the fifth-largest of Germany&#x27;s 13 wine regions. White grape varieties cover 91 percent of the region&#x27;s total vineyard surface. The trend in total vineyard area has until recently been slightly negative over a longer period of time, down from in 1988 to in 2003 and to in 2006. It is primarily lesser sites previously planted with &quot;low quality&quot; varieties that have been abandoned in this process; during the 20-year period from 1988 to 2008, plantings of Müller-Thurgau decreased by 55% and those of Elbling by 49%. However, in 2007 and 2008, the negative trend in total plantations has been broken, and the Mosel vineyard surface has seen a small increase of in two years.

The projected Mosel High Bridge will cross and affect some of the most famous vineyards prompting international wine critics and oenologists to oppose its construction.

==Wine region==
Within the Mosel region, there are the following six districts (&quot;Bereiche&quot;) and 19 collective vineyard designations (&quot;Großlagen&quot;), plus 524 single vineyard (&quot;Einzellagen&quot;) designations. Four of the six districts are situated on the river Mosel, and one each on rivers Saar and Ruwer.
*District Burg Cochem / more commonly known as Untermosel or Terrassenmosel
The Cochem district is home to some of the steepest vineyards in the Mosel planted on soil composed of blue devonian slate, red slate and quartzite. Many of the vineyards of the lower Mosel are terraced, which has led many producers to adopt the name Terrassenmosel, which sounds nicer than Untermosel in German. This district produces a higher proportion of dry wines than the rest of the region. A well known vineyard from this area is the &quot;Juffermauer&quot; located near Treis-Karden, whose name means &quot;Virgin-Wall&quot; in the local Franconian dialect/language.

*District Bernkastel / more commonly known as Mittelmosel
This is the central district of the region. One of the most notable vineyards in this area is known as &quot;Doctorberg&quot;, and its wines as &quot;Bernkasteler Doctor&quot;. An apocryphal story of how the vineyard got its name originated in the late Middle Ages when a local archbishop was miraculously cured of a terminal illness by drinking wine made from the grapes of this vineyard.

Other notable vineyards of the Mittelmosel include the Sundial (German &quot;Sonnenuhr&quot;) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large sundials were built in these vineyards so that the workers would know what time to break for lunch or the end of the work day. Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more full-bodied than wine produced from other vineyards. In a similar way to many of Burgundy&#x27;s Grand Cru vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows of vines. The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.

*District Ruwertal / more commonly known as Ruwer (its formal name is due to the fact that Ruwer also is a suburb of Trier. The Ruwer is an estuary that flows into the Mosel; &quot;Tal&quot; is German for valley.)
Located to the southeast of Trier, this region includes the vineyards around Waldrach and Kasel. The region is home to many vineyards &quot;in Alleinbesitz&quot; (monopole). At Mertesdorf, there is a Roman aqueduct that connects the Grünhaus vineyard with the city of Trier. The quality of Ruwer wine is particularly dependent on the quality of the vintage with cool vintages marked by sharply acidic wines that quickly fade and warmer vintage producing some of the most delicate and perfumed expressions of German wines.

*District Saar
Like the Ruwer region, wine from the Saar district (along the lower course of the Saar River, in Rhineland-Palatinate) is particularly dependent on the overall quality of the vintage typically only 4 years out of every 10 producing a worthwhile set of wines. The wines that do come out of these warm vintages are noted for their apple-like freshness and steely mineral notes. The most ideal vintages allow harvest to take place between late October and mid November when the grapes can develop enough sugar to produce floral and honeyed notes.

*District Obermosel
This wine district is composed of a thin strip of land along the Luxembourg border. The region starts just north of Igel and continues south to the village of Palzem where it meets the Moseltor district. Elbling, Müller-Thurgau, and Auxerrois Blanc are some of the region largest plantings. Obermosel and Moseltor contain very few notable vineyards compared to the other districts of the region.

*District Moseltor
The Moseltor area is the most southern area of the Mosel region, and is located together with the Obermosel along the Luxembourg border. The Elbling grape is the most commonly planted here producing a thin, rustic wine with high acidity. Sparkling wine production is growing in this area. The reason why tiny Moseltor with its around of vineyards is a separate &quot;Bereich&quot; is that it, in contrast to the other 99% of Mosel&#x27;s vineyard area, is located in the state of Saarland, and therefore is supervised by this state&#x27;s government. All of Moseltor is located within the borders of Perl.

==Wines==

The wines of the Upper Mosel, especially along the Saar and Ruwer tributaries, are characterized by their low alcohol content in the 6-9% range with intense fruity notes and high acidity. An obscure local poet once described them as &#x27;Sonnenfeuer, Sternengold, Kühlen Mondlichtschein&#x27; - The fire of the Sun, the gold of the stars, and cool moonlight. The wines of the Middle Mosel are considered the most complete examples of German wines with some of the finest examples being able to age gracefully for 50–100 years. Mosel Rieslings rely on a strong presence of tartaric acid to balance the grape&#x27;s sugar and to help impart its fruity notes. A characteristic of all Mosel wines is their normally high acidity and transparency of clearly defined flavors. The wines of the Mosel region are traditionally packaged in a long green colored &quot;hock style&quot; wine bottle. Historically the green color distinguished Mosel wines from the brown bottles of the Rheinhessen.

Plantings of Müller-Thurgau accounts for more the 20% of the Mosel wine production and is typically used for basic quaffing wine or sweet wine. The Elbing grape accounts for a little more than 9% of the area&#x27;s production and is often used as a low-cost riesling alternative in the production of sparkling Sekt. The Mosel is also well known for its Eiswein production with the area&#x27;s characteristic high acidity coupled with the sweetness produced by the concentration of the sugars in the frozen grapes.

==Grape varieties==
The most cultivated grape varieties, by area in 2008, were:

==Associations==
There are two major wine growers&#x27; associations in the Mosel region, the &quot;Großer Ring&quot;, which is a regional section of the VDP, and the &quot;Bernkasteler Ring&quot;. They both arrange annual wine auctions of top wines. Producers can submit their wines to the VDP for taste testing to qualify as reserve wines known as &quot;Erste Lage&quot; (meaning first site). These wines are subject to several regulations; for example, the harvesting must be by hand and the yield must not exceed 220 cases per acre (50 hl/ha).

<text>Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École () is a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris.

It used to host the training school for officers of the French army, the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr (ESM), which was relocated to Coëtquidan in 1945.
The old buildings of the ESM are now used by the lycée militaire de Saint-Cyr (military high school of Saint-Cyr).

Inhabitants are called &quot;Saint-Cyriens&quot; (uppercase, with students or graduates from the school called &quot;saint-cyriens&quot; with lowercase).

==Geography==
Saint-Cyr lies in the &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Versailles, west of the Park of Versailles. It is named after St. Cyricus.
Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École is served by Saint-Cyr station, which is an interchange station on Paris RER line C, on the Transilien Line U suburban rail line, and on the Transilien Line N suburban rail line.

Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;Ecole airfield is long established and lies on the edge of the commune. It is used by light aircraft flown by private pilot owners and by members of aero clubs. It is operated for public use by Aéroports de Paris.

==History==
King Louis XIV of France, at the request of Madame de Maintenon, founded Maison royale de Saint-Louis, an institute for poor young ladies. It later became a military hospital. Napoleon founded the military academy for infantry and cavalry officers in 1808.

The tomb of Madame de Maintenon lies in the Chapel.

<text>Athy ( ; ) is a market town at the meeting of the River Barrow and the Grand Canal in south-west County Kildare, Ireland, 72 kilometres southwest of Dublin. A population of 11,035 (as of the 2022 census) made it the sixth largest town in Kildare and the 45th largest in the Republic of Ireland, a growth of 82% since the 2002 census.

==Name==
Athy or is named after a 2nd-century Celtic chieftain, Ae, who is said to have been killed on the river crossing, thus giving the town its name &quot;the town of Ae&#x27;s ford&quot;.

The &quot;Letters of the Ordnance Survey&quot; (1837) note that &quot;The town is now called by the few old people who speak Irish there and in the Queen&#x27;s County [Laois], , pronounced Blahéé&quot;, where &quot;éé&quot; stands for English &#x27;ee&#x27; [i:] as clarified by a note written in pencil in Irish as &quot;Blá thí&quot;.

==History==
According to Elizabethan historian William Camden, Ptolemy&#x27;s map of Ireland circa 150 AD names the Rheban district along the River Barrow as Ῥαίβα. Modern cartography, however, dismisses the claim by using triangulation and flocking algorithms. This method establishes that Ptolemy&#x27;s Ῥαίβα was actually located at Rathcroghan, the traditional capital of the Connachta.

A castle existed at Rheban from the Norman period onward.

The town at Athy developed from a 12th-century Anglo-Norman settlement to an important stronghold on the local estates of the FitzGerald earls of Kildare, who built and owned the town for centuries.

Athy Priory, a Dominican monastery, was founded in 1253.

The Confederate Wars of the 1640s were played out in many arenas throughout Ireland, and Athy—for a period of eight years—was one of the centres of war involving the Royalists, Parliamentarians and the Confederates. The town was bombarded by cannon fire many times and the Dominican Monastery, the local castles and the town&#x27;s bridge (dating from 1417) all succumbed to the destructive forces of the cannonball. The current bridge, the Crom-a-Boo Bridge, was built in 1796, with the foundation stone laid by the Duke of Leinster.

The first town charter dates from 1515 and Athy Town Hall was constructed in around 1745. The completion of the Grand Canal in 1791, linking here with the River Barrow, and the arrival of the railway in 1846, illustrate the importance of the town as a commercial centre. From early on in its history Athy was a garrison town loyal to the Crown. English garrisons stayed in the barracks in Barrack Lane after the Crimean War and contributed greatly to the town&#x27;s commerce. Home for centuries to English soldiers, Athy gave more volunteer soldiers to the Great War of 1914–18 than any other town of similar size in Ireland.

===Centre of Hiberno-English===

Athy has evolved as a centre for Hiberno-English, the mix of the Irish and English language traditions. A dialect starting with old Irish beginnings, evolved through Norman and English influences, dominated by a church whose first language was Latin and educated through Irish. Athy in particular was a mixing pot of languages that led to modern Hiberno-English. Positioned at the edge of the Pale, sandwiched between the Irish and English speaking partitions, Athy traded language between the landed gentry, the middle class merchants, the English working class garrison soldiers and the local peasantry. Many locals words borrow from the Irish tradition, such as &quot;bokety&quot;, &quot;fooster&quot; or &quot;sleeveen&quot;, while words like &quot;kip&quot;, &quot;cop-on&quot; or even &quot;grinds&quot; have their origins in Old or Middle English.

This tradition of spoken word led to a lyrical approach to composition and perhaps explains the disproportionate number of writers Athy has produced. Athy becomes subject and object of creative endeavours – the traditional folk song, &quot;Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye&quot;, is a prime example. Other songs in this tradition include &quot;Lanigan&#x27;s Ball&quot; and &quot;Maid of Athy&quot;. Another song of note from the area is called &quot;The Curragh Of Kildare&quot;, the first song collected by Robbie Burns. Athy is also the surname of a minor character in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, who tells Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist, that they both have strange surnames and makes a joke about County Kildare being like a pair of breeches because it has Athy in it. Patrick Kavanagh alludes to Athy in his poem &quot;Lines Written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin&quot;: &quot;And look! a barge comes bringing from Athy / And other far-flung towns mythologies.&quot;

===Birth of motor racing===
On 2 July 1903, the Gordon Bennett Cup race routed through Athy. It was the first international motor race to be held in Britain or Ireland. The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in the British Isles, and Ireland was suggested as the venue because racing was illegal on British public roads. After some lobbying and changes to local laws, County Kildare was chosen, partly because the straightness of the roads would be a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which thus became known as British racing green. The route consisted of several loops of a circuit that passed-through Kilcullen, The Curragh, Kildare, Monasterevin, Stradbally and Athy, followed by another loop through Castledermot, Carlow and Athy again. The race was won by the Belgian racer Camille Jenatzy, driving a Mercedes.

==Places of interest==
*Athy Courthouse: Athy&#x27;s courthouse was designed by Frederick Darley and built in the 1850s; it was originally the town&#x27;s corn exchange. 
*O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bar: One of the town&#x27;s pubs, Frank O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bar, is considered a tourist attraction and was voted one of the top ten Irish bars in the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; in 1999. Hardware merchants Griffin Hawe now occupy the town&#x27;s 6 ft. wide and 12 ft. high 18th-century cockpit. 
*Kilkea Castle: Kilkea Castle is located just 5 km (3.1 mi) northwest of Castledermot, near the village of Kilkea. It was a medieval stronghold of the FitzGeralds, Earls of Kildare.
*Woodstock Castle: built in the early 13th century to protect the north end of the ford and its western approach. A stone cuboid.

*White&#x27;s Castle: White&#x27;s Castle was built in 1417 by Sir John Talbot, Viceroy of Ireland, to protect the bridge over the Barrow and the inhabitants of the Pale. Built into the wall on either side of the original entrance doorway are two sculptured slabs. On the right of the former doorway is the Earl of Kildare&#x27;s coat of arms, signifying the earl&#x27;s ownership of the castle in former days. The slab on the left bears the date 1573, and the name Richard Cossen, Sovereign of Athy.
*The Moat of Ardscull: The Moat of Ardscull is the focal point of local legend about &quot;little people&quot;. Assumed to have been built in the late 12th or 13th century, the first clear reference to the moat is in 1654 when the &quot;Book of General Orders&quot; noted a request from the inhabitants of County Kildare for the State to contribute £30 &quot;towards the finishing of a Fort that they have built at the Moate of Ardscull&quot;.
*Athy Workhouse: St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital was formerly the Athy Workhouse. The Athy Poor Law Union was formally declared on 16 January 1841 and covered an area of . The new Athy Union workhouse was erected in 1842–43 on a site half a mile (800 m) north-west of Athy. Designed by the Poor Law Commissioners&#x27; architect George Wilkinson, the building was based on one of his standard plans to accommodate 600 inmates.

*St Michael&#x27;s Church: Originally built in the 14th century. Some of the vestry and side walls have disappeared, but there is still some of the original church remaining. A small cross lies within the church grounds and it is said that a cross or font is buried in a grave, within the ruins. There was at one time an arch that stood in front of St. Michael&#x27;s but during some renovations many years ago, this was taken down.
*Quaker Meeting House: Built in 1780 and standing on Meeting Lane. The first Quakers in Athy may have been Thomas Weston and his wife who in 1657 &quot;received the truth&quot; from Thomas Loe, an English preacher, who was visiting some friends in County Carlow (and who later influenced William Penn). They were soon joined by the Bonnett family, the first Quaker family to settle in Carlow. A Quaker meeting was settled in Athy by 1671, the year in which Athy was included in the list of towns where the Leinster Province Meeting was held. The local Quakers met for worship once a week on Wednesdays, and every month a district meeting was held in Carlow to transact church business. Athy, as part of the Carlow district, also sent delegates to the Province&#x27;s quarterly meetings.
*The Dominican Church: The Dominicans arrived in Athy in 1253 or 1257. They settled on the eastern bank of the Barrow, first in thatched huts of wood and clay, later in a stone priory and church dedicated to St Peter Martyr, one of the earliest saints of the Order. Today, it is the opposite bank of the river that is dominated by the Dominican Church. In November 2015 the Dominicans finally left Athy due to a lack of friars, and the church and lands have been bought by Kildare County Council. It now operates as the town&#x27;s local library.
*Shackleton Museum (formerly Athy Heritage Centre): Athy contains the only permanent exhibition on Ernest Shackleton, who was born at Kilkea House. The museum has a collection of artefacts from Athy&#x27;s past as well as artefacts from Shackleton&#x27;s expeditions. Among the most impressive is a scale model of the &quot;Endurance&quot;. Each year the museum arranges and hosts the Shackleton Autumn School, with speakers from around the world discoursing on different aspects of Antarctica and Shackleton&#x27;s life. In December 2022, the museum closed temporarily for upgrade works.
*Aontas Ógra: The local youth club in Athy which was set up, originally, as an Irish-speaking revival in 1956. It soon developed into a youth club and was the first boy-girl youth club in Ireland. It is still well-established to this day as an independent youth club in Kildare and is located now, beside ARCH on the Ballylinan road.
*1798 Rebellion Memorial: This landmark is located in Emily Square and is dedicated to Athy&#x27;s role in the 1798 Rebellion, as well as a memorial to local people who died during the famine years.

==Population==
Athy was the largest town in Kildare from the first official records in 1813 (population 3,192) until 1891 (population 4,886), and again between 1926 and 1946 and between 1951 and 1961. In 1837 the population was 4,494. The 2022 census established the population of Athy at 11,035.
==Transport ==
===Road===
The town is located on the N78 national secondary road where it crosses the R417 regional road. In 2010 the N78 was re-aligned so that it no longer heads from Athy towards Kilcullen and Dublin via Ardscull, but now connects with the M9 motorway near Mullamast. The old Athy-Kilcullen section of the road previously known as the N78 is now the R418.

As in December 2021, the N78 Athy Southern Distributor Road (Bypass) has been awarded tender, and is about to go to construction. This should be open to traffic by the end of 2023, and will take up to 8000 vehicles a day out of the town centre.

===Rail===
Athy is connected to the Irish rail network via the Dublin–Waterford main line. Athy railway station opened on 4 August 1846 and closed for goods traffic on 6 September 1976. There is a disused siding to the Tegral Slate factory (formerly Asbestos Cement factory). This is all that is left of the former branch to Wolfhill colliery. This side line was built by the United Kingdom government in 1918 due to wartime shortage of coal in Ireland. The concrete bridge over the River Barrow on this branch is one of the earliest concrete railway under-bridges in Ireland.

===Bus===
JJ Kavanagh&#x27;s route 717 and Go-Ahead Ireland&#x27;s route 130 and 130a serves the town frequently. South Kildare Community Transport also operates two routes from the town serving outlying villages and rural areas.

Line &#x27;897&#x27; &quot;Kilkenny – Castlecomer – Carlow – Athy&quot; connects the town with Kilkenny.

==Sport==
Athy GAA was formed in 1887, and its playing pitches in the early days changed several times until 1905. In 1905 the club rented a field at the Dublin road from the South Kildare Agricultural Society—the present day Geraldine Park. The club had the initiative in those early days to erect a paling around the pitch and was the first club in Leinster to do so. This initiative and the club&#x27;s effort were rewarded when the All-Ireland finals were played in Athy in 1906.

Athy Rugby Club was founded in 1880 and is a five-time winner of the Leinster Towns Cup.

Athy Golf Club was formed in 1906 as a nine-hole course and was extended to 18 holes in 1993. The course had a par of 71 and it extended to 6,400 yards from the medal tees. It is situated at Geraldine, a mile from town on the Kildare Road.

Among the longer-standing sports clubs in the area is Athy Cricket Club, which was founded in 1872 and was one of the first cricket clubs in Kildare.

Tri-Athy is a triathlon event held in Athy on the June Bank Holiday weekend.

Other sports clubs serving the area include Athy Tennis Club, and Athy Town AFC. the club was formed in 1948 and is the main association football club in the town, it has now over 450 members with teams ranging from u4s to two senior adult teams, the junior teams play in the Kildare and District underage league with the senior teams playing in the leinster senior league and the carlow District football league respectively. The club celebrated its 75th birthday in 2023 making it one of the oldest soccer teams in leinster. 
The club play their games in Aldridge park which is situated in the showgrounds with Athy GAA and Athy Rugby club.

==Twinning==
In 2004, the town was twinned with the French town of Grandvilliers in the Oise-Picardy &quot;&quot;. The French twinning committee is named &quot;La Balad&#x27;Irlandaise&quot;, and official visits take place every two years, while musical and student exchanges take place more regularly.

<text>The École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr (, , abbr. ESM) is a French military academy, and is often referred to as Saint-Cyr (). It is located in Coëtquidan in Guer, Morbihan, Brittany. Its motto is &quot;Ils s&#x27;instruisent pour vaincre&quot;, literally meaning &quot;They study to vanquish&quot; or, more freely put, &quot;Training for victory&quot;. French cadet officers are called &quot;saint-cyriens&quot; or &quot;cyrards&quot;. France&#x27;s other most senior military education institute is the &quot;&quot; (EdG) (School of Warfare), located in the &quot;École militaire&quot; complex, in Paris.

French students who enter Saint-Cyr as cadets are about 21 years old, and undergo three years of training. All ESM cadets graduate with a Master of Arts or a Master of Science and are commissioned officers.

The academy was founded in Fontainebleau in 1802 by Napoleon. It was moved in 1806 to the buildings of the former &quot;Maison Royale de Saint-Louis&quot;, in Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École, west of Paris. During the Second World War, the cadets moved several times due to the German invasion. They eventually settled in 1945 in the Coëtquidan military camp in Morbihan.

==History==


The &quot;École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr&quot; was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte on 1 May 1802 (the Law of &quot;11 Floréal an X&quot; according to the then-official revolutionary calendar), to replace the &quot;École Royale Militaire&quot; then located in Fontainebleau. Renamed the &quot;École Spéciale Impériale Militaire&quot; after Bonaparte was proclaimed emperor, it moved in 1808 to Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École (Yvelines) in the castle of the former &quot;Maison royale de Saint-Louis&quot;, a school for girls of the French nobility disbanded at the time of the Revolution.

The school trained a large number of young officers and generals who served during the Napoleonic Wars, and later Napoleon III created the Prince Imperial division for family members, It remained stationed in Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École after Napoleon&#x27;s deposition and through all regime changes until 1940. After the defeat of the French Army against Germany in 1940, the school moved to the free zone, in the south of France, in Aix-en-Provence. After the invasion of the free zone by the Germans in 1942, the school was disbanded, but French cadet officer training went on, part in Cherchell (Algeria, then Free French territory) and part in the United Kingdom (&quot;Cadets de la France Libre&quot;) under General de Gaulle&#x27;s command, albeit under British supervision and guidance.

At the Libération of France in 1944, the school was reunited under the command of General de Lattre de Tassigny and settled in the somewhat remote and isolated military camp of Coëtquidan, Morbihan, because the &quot;&quot;vieux bahut&quot; (old school) had been severely damaged by an Allied bombing during the Libération campaign.

Saint-Cyr has remained there to this day. A reform in 1961 split the school into two entities: the current &quot;École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr&quot; (ESM), devoted to the training of direct-recruitment officers, recruited through an annual national competitive exam, and the &quot;École Militaire Interarmes&quot; (EMIA), cadets from internal recruitment (selected from non-commissioned officer (NCO) ranks and reserve officer ranks) and added a third entity, the &quot;École Militaire du Corps Technique et Administratif&quot; (EMCTA), devoted to the formation of administrative specialist officers and generals. The school admitted its first female cadets in 1983 and underwent a minor reform in 2002 devised to broaden the diversity of its recruitment.

Since 1802, 65,000 Saint-Cyriens have been trained, along with 2,000 international cadets. Of the French graduates 9,639 died on the field of battle. Alumni also count 11 &quot;Maréchaux de France&quot;, three French heads of state, two flying aces, six members of the &quot;Académie Française&quot;, and one Saint of the Catholic Church.

The school has links with the Royal Military College of Canada, United States Military Academy (West Point), and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Britain, including student exchanges.

===Motto===
Napoleon&#x27;s original motto, &quot;Ils s&#x27;instruisent pour vaincre&quot;&quot; (&quot;They study to overcome/conquer/win&quot;), was changed by the restoration king, Louis XVIII, to: &quot;Ils s&#x27;instruisent pour la Défense de la Patrie&quot; (&quot;They study for the Defence of the Fatherland&quot;). The Napoleonic version was used again from 1848 to 1870. That motto was next changed to &quot;&quot;Honneur et Patrie&quot;&quot; (&quot;Honour and Fatherland&quot;) until 1918, when it reverted again to the original Napoleonic wording.

==Museum==
The museum is open to the public Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday mornings from 10 a.m. – 12 a.m. to group tours and afternoons to the public on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from 2:30 p.m. – 5 p.m. On the weekend, the museum is open to the public from 10 a.m. – 12 a.m. and from 2 p.m. – 6 p.m. The museum is closed to the public on Mondays and it is closed from 2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursdays. The museum is located on Rivoli court. The permanent collection explores the lives of the Saint-Cyrien from the end of the ancient regime to today. The collection shows the evolution of the uniform, personal objects, artwork, authentic documents, arms, clothing and family relics.

==Traditions==

===Class names and insignia===
Since 1829, every class (&quot;promotion&quot;) of Saint-Cyr chooses a name. It can be a nickname (&quot;du Firmament&quot;, &quot;of the Stars&quot;, for the first one), the name of a famous battle (Sevastopol for the 1855–56 Class), the name of a famous soldier or general (Bayard, 1923–25 Class, Foch, 1928–30 Class). Since 1934, every class also chooses a special insignia.

===Uniform===
Cadets of Saint-Cyr wear in full dress (&quot;grand uniforme or GU&quot;) a special uniform, derived from the 1845 Regulations Infantry Officer Dress. This dress incorporates a dark-blue tunic, red trousers (red skirts for female cadets) and a shako with red and white plumes. Tunic facings and trouser stripes are light blue, as is the képi worn on less formal occasions. Red fringed epaulettes are worn by cadets and yellow by cadet-officers. This traditional uniform was worn by both cadets and instructors at Saint-Cyr from 1845 until 1914 and then again from 1930 until 1939. After World War II it was again adopted in 1949.

The shako plumes are nicknamed &quot;Casoars&quot; (cassowaries), because they were first adopted in 1855 at the time of this colorful bird&#x27;s first appearance in the Paris Zoo. While the plumes were not at first welcomed by the cadets, they have become a symbol of Saint-Cyr. The Saint-Cyr cadets of the class of 1913–14, graduating ahead of time with the outbreak of World War I, reportedly vowed to lead their platoons in battle wearing the &quot;casoar&quot; on their service kepis.

===Ceremonies===
The various steps of the cadets&#x27; formation are celebrated in various ceremonies, all performed during nighttime. At the beginning of the first year, after boot camp, the cadets are welcomed with shakos granted to them by the third-year cadets. This is called the &quot;petit soir&quot; or &quot;small night&quot;. At the end of the first year, the cadets are presented with the Casoar (the red and white plumes on their shakos) and with their officer&#x27;s sword. This is the &quot;grand soir&quot; or &quot;big night&quot;. At the end of the second year, cadets are officially commissioned second lieutenants. This is celebrated in the &quot;baptism&quot; (&quot;baptême&quot;) of the class, a ceremony in which every cadet receive the accolade from a senior officer. At the end of the third and final year, the cadets are promoted to the rank of lieutenant and receive their new insignia in a ceremony called the &quot;triumph&quot; (&quot;triomphe&quot;). This ceremony is also the time of solemn proclamation of the class name.

===Re-enactment===
Using authentic battle gear and uniforms of the period, re-enactments of famous battles and ceremonies are regularly staged. The most famous of these is the Battle of Austerlitz, which took place on 2 December 1805 and has been celebrated ever since. 2 December, nicknamed &quot;2S&quot; by the Saint-Cyr cadets, is the date of many Saint-Cyr related celebrations in the Army proper or among the alumni associations made up of graduates of the school.

==Application==
Cadets are recruited through a national annual competitive exam, after previous tertiary education. French students take exams on general knowledge, aptitude and intelligence; sit for an interview and pass a test of physical ability.

* Standard test (&quot;concours sur épreuves&quot;) : Recruitment occurs after two years of classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles, like most other French Grandes écoles, or a three-year &quot;license&quot; in a university. The exams propose optional pathways. Maths/science was traditionally the preferred entrance path but today economics and philosophy/literature are also common.
* Interview and record exam (&quot;concours sur titres&quot;) : These saint-cyriens are recruited after graduate education (master&#x27;s degree). They will follow only the last year of Saint-Cyr training.

In addition, a number of foreign students are admitted annually.

==Training==
As all officers obtain a college major upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. The course is three years long and covers academic training, military strategy and theory, practice of war, training, physical training and leadership and organisational training.

The first-year involves military training and academics. The last two years focus on academics with one to three week breaks for military training. Officer cadets at St-Cyr are commissioned officers. The cadets attend school from September to July.

Each promotion (class) of the ESM is organised as a battalion and thus the Corps of Cadets is structured as a regiment. The 1st-year students (rank of &quot;élève-officier&quot; – Cadet) are &quot;France&#x27;s Third Battalion&quot;, 2nd-year (rank of &quot;aspirant&quot; – Officer Designate) are &quot;France&#x27;s Second Battalion&quot; and third-year (rank of sous-lieutenant – 2nd Lieutenant) are &quot;France&#x27;s First Battalion&quot;. The Reserve Officers, Special Duty Officers and &quot;Aspirants&quot; trained at the ESM in short sessions are &quot;France&#x27;s Fourth Battalion&quot;.

Upon graduation, cadets are awarded the diploma of Saint-Cyr, which is a master&#x27;s degree in &quot;Strategy and International Relations&quot; or &quot;Management&quot;, or a military degree, depending on their major. Majors are in engineering or science subjects or specialization in classics, modern or ancient history, modern languages, applied modern languages, security, science and economics, law, computer science, physical education, political science or military studies.

Graduates leave the school with the rank of lieutenant and join the specialist school of the branch they select for one additional year, before being assigned to a regiment to serve as a platoon leader.

<text>The Grand Canal () is the southernmost of a pair of canals that connect Dublin, in the east of Ireland, with the River Shannon in the west, via Tullamore and a number of other villages and towns, the two canals nearly encircling Dublin&#x27;s inner city. Its sister canal on the Northside of Dublin is the Royal Canal. The last working cargo barge passed through the Grand Canal in 1960.

==Branches==
* Main line from Grand Canal Harbour near St. James&#x27;s Gate to Shannon Harbour in County Offaly.
** Most of the Dublin City section of the route is now used by the Luas. While this section was in use, the canal from Crumlin to the Liffey in Ringsend Basin, which forms part of the current main line, was considered to be a branch. It was a later add-on and was known as the Circular Line.
* Naas/Corbally 
** Navigable to Naas, but a low bridge prevents access to Corbally
* Barrow, joining the River Barrow at Athy
* Milltown feeder
* The Mountmellick Line, which left the Barrow Line at Monasterevin and passed through Portarlington (abandoned)
* Blackwood feeder (abandoned)
* Lough Boora feeder (abandoned)
* Kilbeggan (abandoned)
* Ballinasloe (starting on the far side of the River Shannon from Shannon Harbour; abandoned and now used by Bord na Móna industrial railway)

==History==

The idea of connecting Dublin to the Shannon was proposed as early as 1715, however it wasn&#x27;t until 1751 when the Board of Inland Navigation was formed by an Act of Parliament that development started to take off.

In 1757 the Irish Parliament granted Thomas Omer £20,000 to start construction of a canal. By 1759 he reported that in the Bog of Allen and of canal from the River Liffey near Sallins towards Dublin were complete. By 1763 he had completed 3 locks and 6 bridges towards Dublin and was concentrating on establishing a water supply from the Morell River near Sallins. At this point, the Corporation of Dublin realised that the canal could be used to improve the water supply to the city via the city basin, and put up the money to complete the canal into the city. But when the canal was filled, the banks gave way and the city didn&#x27;t obtain its water. By 1768, £77,000 had been spent on the project and little more was forthcoming.

===Grand Canal Company=== 

In 1772 the Grand Canal Company was established by a group of noblemen and merchants, including public subscription, to ensure the future of the canal and to tackle the biggest barrier to the canal, the Bog of Allen. This was a new venture for canals. The company invited John Smeaton and his assistant William Jessop to Ireland for two weeks to advise them. Smeaton made a recommendation to skirt round the bog but to build the canal at the full height, in contrast to Omer&#x27;s efforts which attempted to drain parts of the bog and build at a lower level. This was to prove an expensive mistake, although he also advised reducing the generous locks that Omer had built (42m by 6 m / 137 ft by 20 ft) to 18m by 4m (60 ft by 14 ft), which would bring about considerable savings in the total cost of the canal.
The canal from Sallins was finally opened to traffic in 1779 and a twice-weekly passenger service from Sallins to Dublin started in 1780. The canal was extended to Robertstown in 1784, including the Leinster Aqueduct across the Liffey, constructed by Richard Evans, and to a junction with the River Barrow at Athy by 1791.

The &quot;Circle Line&quot; through Dublin from Portobello to Ringsend, where large docks adjacent to the Liffey were constructed, was started in 1790 and opened in 1796. The company had by then turned its attention to completing the link with the Shannon. Getting across the Bog of Allen took more than five years of struggle under the guidance of Jessop, who attempted to use walls of clay to support the walls of the canal. Though the canal was opened to Daingean (then Philipstown) in 1797, serious breaches occurred and Jessop was forced to abandon this method. The continuation to the Shannon then continued under the leadership of John Killaly, who succeeded in crossing another bog by carrying out drainage works for several years before construction. The work was substantially completed in 1803, but because of leakages and a dry summer the official opening had to be delayed until April 1804. The canal had taken 47 years to build, advancing at a rate of 7.7 metres per day.

The whole work had cost in the region of £877,000 and it was some years before it began to make a profit, although regular dividends had been paid to shareholders. Trade increased from 100,000 tons in 1800 to double that in 1810. Revenues from passenger boats also increased to £90,000 by that date. (The novel &quot;The Kellys and the O&#x27;Kellys&quot; (1848) by Anthony Trollope includes a description of a tedious journey by passenger flyboat from Portobello to Ballinasloe.) But the long saga had prompted a rival venture, the Royal Canal, which started construction in 1790 and was finally opened in 1817 after the government had stepped in to resolve disputes between the two companies.

The first steamer to traverse the canal from Dublin to Limerick was the Shannon Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s wood paddle steamer &quot;Mountaineer&quot;, which received the Canal Company&#x27;s permission to proceed in October 1826. The second was the Dublin and Wexford Steam Company&#x27;s iron paddle steamer , which arrived in Limerick on 2 February 1827.

Apart from the breaches during construction, there were breaches on a branch of the canal in 1833, due to which one child drowned, and another in 1846. In 1855 the main canal breached at the same location as in 1797. In 1916 again 300 yards of the canal were displaced. The last breach was on 15 January 1989, between the Blundell Aqueduct and Downshire bridge. 18 miles of canal drained into the surroundings.

In the 1960s, Dublin Corporation had plans to drain the canal and replace it with a 6-lane dual-carriageway as part of a plan to drain and lay new sewage pipes along the canal bed. The plans were met with opposition and a petition of 100,000 signatures against the proposal, and eventually abandoned.

==Route==

The Grand Canal begins in Grand Canal Dock at the River Liffey, and continues through to the River Shannon. It passes through Ringsend and traverses the southside, delineating the northern extremities of Ballsbridge, Ranelagh, Rathmines, Harolds Cross and Crumlin. This section, known as the Circular Line (or Circle Line), has seven locks. The path of the original main line, which serviced the Grand Canal Harbour, the City Basin (reservoir) and Guinness brewery, can be seen at Rialto. Most of the route of this line now runs alongside the Luas Red Line.

From Suir Road Bridge, the lock numbering starts again at 1 as the canal heads west through the suburbs of Dublin West and into County Kildare. At Sallins the Naas/Corbally branch diverts southwards, while the Grand Canal continues west passing Caragh, Prosperous and Robertstown, its highest point. Just outside Sallins, the canal passes over the River Liffey at the Leinster Aqueduct. Just east of Robertstown is the location where the Blackwood Feeder used to join the canal, whilst just to the west can be found the busiest junction on the canal where the Old Barrow Line, Milltown Feeder and the entrances to the Athy &amp; Barrow Navigation meet. Further west, the canal passes Edenderry, Tullamore, Rahan and Pollagh before it reaches the Shannon at Shannon Harbour in County Offaly. In total the main line of the canal is with 43 locks, five of which are double locks.

==Disasters==
In December 1792, there was a major accident on the Grand Canal. A passage boat left Dublin bound for Athy. It seems that one hundred and fifty people, many of them drunk, forced their way onto a barge, in spite of the captain warning them that the boat would capsize if they did not leave. Near the eighth lock, five men, four women and two children drowned when the boat capsized. The rest of the passengers escaped.

On the evening of Saturday, 6 April 1861 in Portobello Harbour, a horse-drawn bus, driven by Patrick Hardy, had just dropped a passenger on the canal when one of the horses started to rear. The horses backed the bus through the wooden rails of the bridge. The bus, horses and six passengers inside the bus, plunged into the cold waters and drowned. The conductor was able to jump clear and the driver was pulled from the water by a passing policeman.

In July 2024, two homeless men were recovered from the Canal having drowned.

==Ownership==

Until 1950 the &quot;Grand Canal Company&quot; had ownership of the canal, when the Transport Act 1950 transferred the canal to Córas Iompair Éireann. This situation continued until the Canals Act 1986 gave it to the Office of Public Works. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, a new all-Ireland body called Waterways Ireland was established in 1999 and assumed responsibility for most inland navigable waterways including the Grand Canal.

==Grand Canal Way==
The Grand Canal Way () is a long-distance trail that follows the towpath of the canal from Lucan Bridge, near Adamstown, to Shannon Harbour. It is typically completed in five days. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Waterways Ireland. At Robertstown, the Grand Canal Way intersects with the Barrow Way, which follows the Barrow Line extension to the canal to Athy for part of its route. There is also an long greenway between the 3rd Lock at Inchicore and the 12th Lock at Lucan, which opened in June 2010.

<doc id="441790" wikidata="Q179683" url="?curid=441790" title="Shannon hydroelectric scheme">
<text>The Shannon hydroelectric Scheme was a major development by the Irish Free State in the 1920s to harness the power of the River Shannon. Its product, the Ardnacrusha power plant, is a hydroelectric power station located near Ardnacrusha within County Clare approximately from the Limerick border. It is Ireland&#x27;s largest river hydroelectric scheme and is operated on a purpose built headrace connected to the River Shannon. The plant includes fish ladders so that returning fish, such as salmon, can climb the river safely past the power station.

Completed within 7 years of Irish independence in 1922 at a cost which was equivalent to one fifth of the Irish state&#x27;s annual budget, the plant enabled an enormous surge in demand for electricity across the country and demonstrated the ability of the new government to develop during a difficult financial period. The plant was constructed by the German company Siemens-Schuckert, although much of the design was done by Irish engineers and Ireland provided most of the labour force. The scheme involved changes to the flow of the whole river, multiple dams and bridges and the construction of a national power grid.

The generating plant at Ardnacrusha is composed of three vertical-shaft Francis turbine generators (commissioned in 1929) and one vertical-shaft Kaplan turbine generator (commissioned in 1934) operating under an average head of 28.5 metres. The scheme originally was designed for six turbines, with four turbines fitted. The 85 MW of generating plant in Ardnacrusha was adequate to meet the electricity demand of the entire country in the early years. The full output equates to about 332,000 MWh generated on an annual basis. Ardnacrusha generates at 10.5 kilovolts (kV) but this is transformed to 38 kV for local distribution and to 110 kV for long distance transmission.

==Background==
The first plan to harness the Shannon&#x27;s power between Lough Derg and Limerick was published in 1844 by Sir Robert Kane. Inspired by Nikola Tesla&#x27;s 1896 project at Niagara Falls, &quot;Frazer&#x27;s Scheme&quot; proposed a head-race canal ending at Doonass, and was sanctioned by the 1901 &quot;Shannon Water and Electric Power Act&quot;. This envisaged a seasonal scheme with a back-up steam turbine to generate electricity in the summer, but the overall cost was considered too great and the Act was shelved. In 1902 SF Dick proposed a sharper fall at Doonass. The British Board of Trade appointed a committee in 1918 which approved proposals by Theodore Stevens and published a report in 1922. This envisaged altering upper lake levels to create extra storage of 10,000 million cubic feet, at a cost of £2.6m. 
At the end of 1923, the engineer Thomas McLaughlin approached the new Irish Free State&#x27;s Minister for Industry and Commerce Patrick McGilligan with a proposal for a much more ambitious project. McLaughlin had started working for Siemens-Schuckert, a large German engineering firm, in late 1922, and his scheme would exploit the full height difference between Lough Allen and the sea. He drew on the analysis of 25 years of flow at the weir at Killaloe published by John Chaloner Smith, an engineer with the Commissioners of Public Works. McGilligan was enthusiastic although the President of the Executive Council, W. T. Cosgrave, was more cautious. The scheme was published by Siemens in September 1924 and the government appointed a team of experts from Norway and Switzerland to check its viability. It caused considerable political controversy as the cost of £5.2m was a large part of the new state&#x27;s entire budget in 1925 of £25m and interests in Dublin preferred a more localised solution. But the experts supported the centralised solution which would require a distribution grid all over the country but recommended a two-stage implementation of the power generators. The government accepted this and by April 1925 had introduced the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925 in the Dáil.

==Construction==

In 1925 Siemens started the works with Dr. McLaughlin as managing director and Professor Frank Sharman Rishworth, who took a leave of absence from University College Galway, as chief civil engineer. A completion time limit of three and a half years, with penalty clauses for failure of adherence to this limit, was written into the contract. Around 150 of the skilled workers and engineers on the power station were Germans. A camp was set up for the workers that included living quarters for 750 men and a dining room that seated 600. Initially employment for 700 was provided, whilst at its peak there were 5,200 employed during the construction phase, with this dropping back to 2,500 near completion.
Siemens had to import a vast array of machinery from Bremen and Hamburg and built a 96 km narrow gauge railway to transport workers and supplies around the site, which included 76 steam locomotives. The government made good the local roads which were in an appalling state. The headrace involved building embankments up to 25m high over a distance of 10 km and many unforeseen geological problems were encountered. of soil had to be moved and of rock. Four major bridges were built and nine rivers diverted as well as numerous streams. Three large Parsons turbines were installed at the base of the dam which could generate 35MW, more than the entire public supply of the time. In addition a supply network of 110kV power lines was installed to Dublin, Cork and other centres.

The construction project was not without controversy. Unskilled labourers were only paid agricultural wages producing strikes, national and governmental debate over wages, conditions, and spending over-runs. Despite this, there was a final cost overrun for Siemens of £150,000.

The site attracted a huge number of sightseers, transported by excursion trains from all parts of Ireland. By 1929 it reckoned that 250,000 spectators had been guided over the works.

==Electrifying Ireland==
In 1927, the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) was established and took control of the scheme and electricity supply and generation generally. McLaughlin became the managing director.

The Shannon Scheme was officially opened at Parteen Weir on 22 July 1929. One of the largest engineering projects of its day, it served as a model for large-scale electrification projects worldwide. Operated by the ESB, it had an immediate impact on the social, economic and industrial development of Ireland. By 1935, it was producing 80 per cent of Ireland&#x27;s electricity. It continues to supply this power in the 21st century although its contribution is only 2% as of 2017. At the time, it was the largest hydroelectric station in the world, though this was soon superseded by the Hoover Dam, which commenced construction in 1930.

The London Financial Times was highly impressed with the result, commenting:
:&quot;They have thrown on their shoulders the not easy task of breaking what is in reality an enormous inferiority complex and the Shannon Scheme is one - and probably the most vital - of their methods of doing it.&quot;

Within three years the demand for electricity in Ireland had expanded so much that stage 2 was initiated. Instead of the planned three extra penstocks, only one was used but it used a new 30 MW Kaplan turbine with seven blades which produces high efficiency on the relatively small head and therefore increased the capacity of the station to 75 MW by 1933. In 1937, the Poulaphouca Reservoir hydroelectric plant on the River Liffey in County Wicklow was constructed, adding another 35 MW.

In 2002, on the 75th anniversary of the plant, its historic status was recognised by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, in partnership with the American Society of Civil Engineers, who marked the facility as an Engineering Milestone of the 20th century.
==Environmental consequences==
The opening of the scheme had, and continues to have, a significant environmental effect on the part of the Shannon bypassed by the head-race canal, from Parteen Villa north of O&#x27;Briens Bridge to about a mile north of Limerick city. This length of river, especially that running past Castleconnell and the Falls of Doonass was in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries world-famous for fishing, particularly salmon fishing. The diverting of water to the power station had a disastrous effect on this, for two main reasons: Initially, there was no fish pass at Ardnacrusha to allow the salmon to migrate further up the river; this was later rectified. Secondly, the reduction in water flow down the natural channel encouraged more fish to either migrate towards the head-race canal, or to the Mulkear river instead. The problem continues to this day, and the salmon fishing is no longer comparable with the period up to the 1920s, with stocks reduced by about 90%. The conservation status of the critically other species of native fish have also been hurt by the low water levels, such as the critically endangered eel.

===Effects on the bypassed river channel===

====Reduction in water flow====
Once opened, the great majority of the Shannon&#x27;s water was diverted via the head-race canal to the power station. The ESB are required by law to allow 10 cubic meters per second (10 m3/s) to flow down the natural channel. This is roughly what the natural flow would be during dry summer periods prior to the weir being built. All surplus water can be diverted for power generation. The maximum capacity of Ardnacrusha is approximately 400 m3/s, 40 times that which is required to flow down the natural channel (although the power station does not necessarily run at this capacity at all times). For the first few years after the opening of the scheme, water was diverted to the power station only as necessary for the electricity demand at the time, and thus the impact on the river was not initially severe. However, as demand increased, more and more water was diverted, until eventually a situation was reached where, at all times, all available water was diverted for power generation, and the natural channel was permanently reduced to the minimum water flow allowed (except during extreme conditions). In exceptionally wet periods, the flow of water out of Lough Derg is greater than 400 m3/s, and it is then necessary for the surplus to be released down the natural channel through Castleconnell. During these brief periods, the Falls of Doonass are temporarily restored to their former glory. How often this occurs depends on seasonal weather patterns: some years there is no increase above the minimum flow at all. This has led to a substantially dried-up riverbed. The most obvious result on the river south of Parteen Villa always being kept at summer levels is the silting of many of the old salmon pools, and the growth of trees and bushes in many parts of the former riverbed, thus significantly altering both the appearance and ecosystem of the river.

When built, Ardnacrusha had the capacity to supply power for the entire country. Currently, it accounts for around 2-3% of the ESB&#x27;s overall power output. Given the small overall amount of power produced per cubic meter, there is a substantial case for increasing water flow to the natural channel, now that Arnacrusha is producing so small a proportion of ESB&#x27;s power. For example, increasing the flow of the river to 50 m3/s would reduce Ardnacrusha&#x27;s capacity by 1/10 (flow reduced by 40 m3/s), or 8 megawatts; less than 0.3% of ESB&#x27;s national capacity, whilst increasing the water flow to the natural channel 5-fold. This would have a major beneficial effect on the condition of the river south of O&#x27;Briens Bridge.

====Navigation====
The navigable section of water from the southern end of the Killaloe Canal to World&#x27;s End, Castleconnell, was linked to Limerick via the lateral Plassey-Errina canal which had six locks. This became redundant with the construction of the new canal to Ardnacrusha, was dewatered and subsequently became derelict. Recently, several sections have been cleared, and it is now possible to walk from O&#x27;Briens Bridge to Errina lock along the old tow path.
As there is no lock at Parteen weir linking the natural channel to Lough Derg, it is no longer possible for any watercraft to enter, by water, this part of the Shannon.

Navigation of the Shannon is now by the head-race canal which is wide. When all turbines are operating, the speed of the water is which can be challenging in both directions. This leads to the double lock at Ardnacrusha, which will take boats long and wide. The two locks have a combined drop of up to .

==== Shannon Eel Management Programme ====
A trap and transport scheme is in force on the Shannon as part of an eel management programme following the discovery of a reduced eel population. This scheme ensures safe passage for young eels past Ardnacrusha.

===Effects upriver from the scheme===

====Flooding====
The maximum capacity of Ardnacrusha is approximately 400 m3/s. As this is much greater than is available during summer months, during the early years of operation water was stored in the major lakes on the Shannon, Lough Derg, Lough Ree and Lough Allen because Ardnacrusha provided a significant contribution to meeting the nation&#x27;s electricity requirements during that period. By holding these lakes at a higher than natural level, by means of weirs, water accumulated during the wet winter months could be released during much drier periods to maintain supply to the power station. Weirs already existed at Killaloe and Athlone to control lake levels in Lough Derg and Lough Ree respectively. Upon completion of Ardnacrusha, the weir at Athlone was modified and brought under ESB control, and a new weir built at the mouth of Lough Allen to further regulate water levels (the weir at Killaloe was removed, as Lough Derg&#x27;s water level is now controlled by Parteen weir itself). In more recent decades Ardnacrusha&#x27;s significance for electricity production has decreased, and water is no longer stored on the Shannon lakes for electricity generation.

====Navigation====
The scheme simplified navigation between Killaloe and Limerick, as watercraft need to traverse just one double lock at Ardnacrusha. The majority of the Killaloe canal was submerged under the new lake (the &#x27;flooded section&#x27;) south of Killaloe, allowing direct access to the head-race canal. The ESB is responsible for maintaining water levels for navigation throughout the Shannon to between predetermined limits, but they have the right to prioritise levels for electricity generation, should water shortages arise.
