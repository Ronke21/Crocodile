<text>Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown (, ) is one of the historic counties of Scotland, covering an area in the south-west of the country. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was an administrative county used for local government. Since 1975 the area has formed part of Dumfries and Galloway for local government purposes. Wigtownshire continues to be used as a territory for land registration, being a registration county. The historic county is all within the slightly larger Wigtown Area, which is one of the lieutenancy areas of Scotland and was used in local government as the Wigtown District from 1975 to 1996.

Wigtownshire forms the western part of the medieval lordship of Galloway, which retained a degree of autonomy until it was fully absorbed by Scotland in the 13th century. In 1369, the part of Galloway east of the River Cree was placed under the control of a steward and so became known as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The rest of Galloway remained under the authority of a sheriff, and became known as the Shire of Wigtown, or Wigtownshire. The area was also sometimes called West Galloway (). The county town was historically Wigtown, with the administrative centre moving to Stranraer, the largest town, following the creation of Wigtownshire County Council in 1890.

==History==
The 11th-century ex-King of Dublin and Mann, Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, had the title , &quot;King of the Rhinns&quot;, attributed to him on his death in 1065 AD. The western sections of Galloway had been firmly aligned with the Isle of Man, and Norse and Gaelic-Norse settlement names from the 10th and 11th centuries are spread all along the coastal lands of south-western Scotland. These coastal lands became the sub-kingdom or semi-autonomous Lordship of Galloway. Following the death of Lord Alan of Galloway in 1234 the area was fully brought under the control of the Scottish crown. In 1369 Archibald the Grim, Earl of Douglas, was given the part of Galloway east of the River Cree, where he appointed a steward to administer the area, which became known as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The following year, he acquired the rest of Galloway west of the Cree, which continued to be administered by the king&#x27;s sheriff, and so became known as the Shire of Wigtown. This led to the local custom of referring to Kirkcudbrightshire as &quot;The Stewartry&quot; and Wigtownshire as &quot;The Shire&quot;, which continued into the 20th century.

Most of Wigtownshire was still Gaelic-speaking at the beginning of the 16th century.
Elected county councils were established in Scotland in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. Wigtownshire County Council held its first meeting at Wigtown County Buildings in The Square at Wigtown on 22 May 1890, when it was decided to hold the council&#x27;s annual meeting each May at Wigtown, but other meetings were to be held alternately at Stranraer and Newton Stewart. The council later established its main offices at Ashwood House on Sun Street, Stranraer, close to the Sheriff Court on Lewis Street which was the council&#x27;s meeting place when it met in Stranraer.
Wigtownshire was abolished as an administrative county in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. A two-tier system of regions and districts was put in place instead, with the area becoming part of the Dumfries and Galloway region and the Wigtown district. The Wigtown district covered all of the former administrative county of Wigtownshire plus the two parishes of Kirkmabreck and Minnigaff from neighbouring Kirkcudbrightshire. Further local government reform in 1996 saw the Wigtown district abolished and its functions passed to Dumfries and Galloway Council, which continues to operate a Wigtown area committee for the pre-1996 Wigtown district. The former Wigtown district is also used as a lieutenancy area.

==Geography==

Wigtownshire borders the Irish Sea to the west, the Solway Firth to the south, Ayrshire to the north, and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright (or Kidcudbrightshire) to the east. Across the sea to the west lies Northern Ireland and to the south the Isle of Man, both of which can be readily seen on a clear day. Together the Stewartry and Wigtownshire are referred to as Galloway. The county is largely flat, with some low hills in the north, with Craigairie Fell being the county&#x27;s tallest peak at a modest . The western &#x27;hammer-head&#x27; peninsula of Wigtownshire is known as Rhinns of Galloway, and is split from the &#x27;mainland&#x27; by Loch Ryan in the north and Luce Bay in the south; its northern tip is Milleur Point and its southern the Mull of Galloway, which is also the southernmost point in Scotland. Across Luce Bay lies the Machars peninsula, a roughly triangular-shaped land of low hills, separated from Kidcudbrightshire by Wigtown Bay, and culminating in Burrow Head. Machars contains a number of small lochs in its north, notably Dernaglar Loch, Whitefield Loch, Castle Loch and Mochrum Loch. The Scares, a group of very small rock-islands, lie in Luce Bay.

==Transport==
Major road links to the area comprise the A77 to the north, and A75 to the east. The European route E18 starts in Northern Ireland and runs from Stranraer, Wigtownshire (A75) – Gretna (M6) – Carlisle (A69) to Newcastle. It then re-joins at Norway, goes through Sweden, Finland and ends at Saint Petersburg, Russia. Like all European routes, it is not signposted as such in the United Kingdom. The European Union is partly financing &quot;The Stranraer and Loch Ryan Waterfront Project&quot;, at Inch.

===Ferries===

The port at Cairnryan is Scotland&#x27;s main embarkation point for ferries to Northern Ireland, with regular crossings to Larne and the Port of Belfast. These services formerly left from Stranraer.

===Railways===
Stranraer station connects the Glasgow South Western Line to Ayr, and Glasgow Central as well as .

The Beeching cuts cut off the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway and Portpatrick Railway in 1965 resulting in an adverse mileage increase via the Glasgow South Western Line to reach Stranraer from Carlisle and the West Coast Main Line.

===Proposed Irish Sea bridge===
Wigtownshire has been one of the mooted locations for a proposed bridge or tunnel linking Britain and Ireland. A 2010 report by the Centre for Cross Border Studies estimated building a bridge from Galloway to Ulster would cost just under £20.5 billion.

===Archaeology===
In 2012 the University of Glasgow led a community archaeology project in Inch, between Stranraer and Cairnryan, including a geophysical survey of the area to the north of the motte at Innermessan. It is a site with a very long history – from the early mesolithic, about 10,000 years ago, to a medieval town, now disappeared, which in its time was more important than Stranraer.

An unnamed detectorist found a gold lunula in a cultivated field near Garlieston, Sorbie in March 2011, the first Scottish gold lunula found in over 100 years. The lunula is a flat, crescent-shaped neck ornament thought to date from around 2300 – 2200 BC, and described by some archaeologists as a symbol of power. The gold sheet, probably hammered out from a bar, is very thin () and decorated around its edges with incised and punched zigzags, lines and dots. It had been cut up and folded, and the two pieces do not join; together they amount to just under a third of the original collar. Initial surface analysis has shown that the metal contains 11% silver and 0.5% copper. Further analysis may indicate whether the lunula had been made of Irish or Scottish gold. Staff of Stranraer Museum and the Wigtownshire branch of the University of the Third Age walked the field looking for artefacts. Test pits were dug and Historic Scotland commissioned a geophysical survey. No more metalwork was found, nor any evidence for why the lunula might have been buried there.

From Glenluce Sands there have been recovered &quot;more objects of antiquity than from any area of similar extent in Scotland&quot;. The relics range from neolithic to mediaeval times.

The fields between the mound and Dunragit village and Droughduil Mote, Old Luce, Wigtownshire, contain &quot;one of the most important Stone Age sites in Scotland&quot;. Aerial photography and archaeological excavation of the henge has revealed the remains of three massive concentric timber circles; the outer circle was in diameter, almost six times the size of Stonehenge. Built , this huge monument was a ceremonial centre and a meeting place for south-west Scotland&#x27;s early farming communities. Funding for the dig was provided by Historic Scotland and the University of Southampton. The staff at Stranraer Museum assisted with computing and communications facilities and access to collections.

<text>The Guards Armoured Division was an armoured division of the British Army during the Second World War. The division was created in the United Kingdom on 17 June 1941 during the Second World War from elements of the Guards units, the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards, Welsh Guards, and the Household Cavalry.

The division remained in the United Kingdom, training, until 13 June 1944, when it landed several armoured command vehicles at Arromanche. It lagered its advanced tactical headquarters in communication with GHQ awaiting the bulk of the armour Normandy, France, during Operation Overlord as part of VIII Corps. Its first major engagement was Operation Goodwood, the attack by three armoured divisions towards Bourguebus Ridge in an attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead. That was followed by Operation Bluecoat, the advance east of Caen as the Falaise pocket formed. Transferred to XXX Corps, the division liberated Brussels. It led the XXX Corps attack in Operation Market Garden, the ground forces&#x27; advance to relieve airborne troops aiming to seize the bridges up to Arnhem, capturing Nijmegen bridge in conjunction with American paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division. The Tac HQ reached Arnhem but was not able to seize the bridge because German anti tank guns were entrenched on the North side and the British airborne had surrendered or were too far away to help. During the Ardennes offensive, it was sent in bitterly cold weather, which forced the tanks to start their engines every hour to prevent the fuel and oil freezing, to the Meuse as a reserve in case the Germans broke through the American lines; some German tanks breaking through were stopped. It endured hard fighting in Operation Veritable, the advance towards the Rhine through the Reichswald, and again in the advance through Germany. The division existed until 12 June 1945, a little over a month after Victory in Europe Day, when it was reorganised as an infantry division, the Guards Division, after almost exactly four years as an armoured division.

==History==


Brainchild of General Sir Alan Brooke, then the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, the Guards Armoured Division, commanded by Major General Oliver Leese, was formed in May 1941 as a result of the shortage of armoured troops in England to face a German invasion. There was opposition to this move, as it was felt by the establishment that the height of the Guards—selected for height, amongst other criteria, as elite soldiers—would make them poor tank crew. The division originally consisted of two armoured brigades, the 5th and the 6th. These consisted of three tank regiments of Covenanter V tanks and a motor infantry battalion. A certain level of common sense was applied to these changes, with the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards being assigned as the motor battalion, due to the presence of King&#x27;s Company. This group of men were all at least 6 feet tall and were expected to struggle to fit into tanks. Uniquely the Guards Armoured Division also kept its infantry company structure, with the tanks organised into companies and battalions, rather than squadrons and regiments.

At the end of 1942, the division, now under the command of Major General Allan Adair, was split in line with all armoured divisions at this time, with one armoured brigade replaced with a brigade of lorried infantry. At this point the 6th and 5th Guards Armoured Brigades were separated. During this period the division re-equipped with Crusader III tanks, which were again replaced with Sherman Vs by 1944.

===Normandy===
The Guards Armoured Division landed in Normandy at the end of June, and went into battle around Carpiquet Airfield soon after, with the infantry of the 32nd Guards Brigade skirmishing with the 12th SS &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;. However this was only to last a couple of weeks before the armour arrived and the division was deployed further south to participate in Operation Goodwood.

The aim of this attack has been debated many times, but whether an attempt at a breakout or a more limited effort, it had the effect of drawing most of the German reserves towards Caen, aiding the Cobra offensive. Originally intended as a combined attack, it was changed to an armoured assault as the British Army in France had suffered heavy infantry casualties and were struggling to find replacements. As a result, the attack was changed to one largely of armoured divisions, as lost tanks would be easier to replace.

The Guards Armoured Division joined with the 7th and 11th Armoured Divisions for this attack. The aim was to strike south out of the Orne bridgehead on 18 July. The Guards Armoured Division was to advance south-east to capture Vimont and Argences. Prior to this attack the German defences were heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force. Unfortunately this was less effective than hoped against the dug-in defenders, both in the south of Caen and in Cagny and Emieville. All three of these areas were in the path of the Guards advance. The attack quickly bogged down and losses became heavy, the guards losing 60 tanks to a single battery of four Luftwaffe 88mm AA guns. In addition to this, a group of Tiger I tanks of the 503, which had been completely knocked out in the bombardment, recovered enough over the course of the morning to stiffen the resistance against the Guards. In addition, the Guards were checked by a &quot;Schwere Panzerabteilung&quot; and a counterattack by the 12 SS &quot;Hilterjugend&quot;. Novel tactics had to be employed to deal with the more heavily gunned and armoured Tiger, with one being rammed by a Sherman of the Irish Guards.

Whilst taking part in Operation Goodwood east of Cagny, Lt John Gorman who was a Troop Commander in the 2nd Armoured Battalion was probing forward in his Sherman tank &quot;Ballyragget&quot; when suddenly he found himself broadside to a German Tiger II, the German heavy tank that no-one had yet seen. He fired his 75mm gun but the shot bounced off German tank. He was unable to fire again as the Sherman&#x27;s gun was jammed. By now, the Tiger Tank was traversing its gun towards Gorman&#x27;s Sherman so he ordered his driver L/Cpl James Brown to ram the German Tank. The collision disabled the Tiger and caused its crew to bail out. After seeing his own crew to safety, Lt Gorman commandeered a Firefly, &quot;Ballymena&quot;, whose commander had been killed and continued to fire at the Tiger tank with the Firefly&#x27;s 17-pounder gun until the Tiger&#x27;s destruction was complete. For this action Gorman was awarded the Military Cross and his driver, L/Cpl James Brown, was awarded the Military Medal, being the first members of the Allied Expeditionary Forces to knock out a Tiger II. However, the German account is rather different. The Tiger II gunner, Hans-Joachim Thaysen, insisted he never even saw Gorman&#x27;s Sherman and was instead concentrating on firing ahead of him. Thaysen also said that it was a German anti-tank gun friendly fire incident which was likely trying to fire at Gorman&#x27;s Sherman that destroyed his Tiger II, which caused the crew to bail out. The 75mm PaK hit the Tiger II on the left side between the track and running gear. Thaysen said the round penetrated and just missed him under his backside.

The next day enough progress was made to allow the Guards to reach Bourgebus Ridge and support the 7th and 11th Armoured Divisions, German reinforcements started to arrive and the attack ground to a halt. Fighting continued until 20 July, when the gains were consolidated by infantry and the attack died off. The battle, while not a success from the operational point of view, was a battle in which the Guards acquitted themselves satisfactorily. The operation also drew off most of the German mechanised reserves, being convinced that the allies planned to break out from Caen. This left little for reinforcements, when the Americans began Operation Cobra on 25 July.

After Goodwood the Guards Armoured Division was reorganized into unofficial battlegroups. Goodwood had shown the undesirable effects of not having supporting infantry with the tanks. Consequently, the two Grenadier battalions were formed into a battlegroup, with the Coldstream infantry attached to the Irish Guards Tanks and the Coldstream Guards tanks split into two groups and used to support the Irish and Welsh Guards battalions. The units were not organized in any formal way at this point, but rather by who happened to be closest at the time. This organisation was not unique to the Guards, the 11th Armoured also adapted the formation for Bluecoat, apparently on Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s orders. After this reorganisation, the Guards Armoured Division took part in Operation Bluecoat.

Operation Bluecoat was launched on 30 July in support of the Americans taking part in Operation Cobra. Rather than continue to try to push past Caen where the majority of the German armour had redeployed after Goodwood, this attack switched back towards Villers-Bocage to support the Americans and to capture the road junction at Vire and the high ground at Mont Pincon. While the opposition was initially two weak infantry divisions (276th and 326th), they were well dug in, having prepared minefields and other defences. The terrain was bocage, which also slowed down the speed of the attack. Initially the Guards supported the 11th Armoured Division who were the spearhead of the attack by protecting their flank, however they took over the spearhead duties themselves on 1 August, fighting in the bocage until 15 August against elements of the 276th and 326th Infantry, 21st Panzer and 1st, 9th and 10th SS-Panzer Divisions. This was to prove challenging to the Guards who were not used to short-range combat. The Germans ended up committing their tanks piecemeal, and as a result there was no defensive line as such. Instead common opposition would consist of a small mobile group of infantry supported by a few tanks or self-propelled guns. Snipers and mortars were a particular problem in this terrain, with field modifications added to the tank to try to reduce the damage. Due to the difficulty of completely clearing the enemy from a particular area and of supplying sub-units, the attack ground to a halt on 4 August.

On 7 August the Guards had a short break as the Germans concentrated their forces on a counter-offensive against the Americans at Mortain. On that day the Guards were given the 11th Armoured Divisions area to defend as well, freeing up the 11th Armoured. While not actually trying to launch a major advance, attacks in the local area were fierce, particularly around Chenedolle. Support from other arms was also provided, with the Welsh infantry regiment supported by Churchill tanks of the 6th Guards Tank Brigade and the Household Cavalry deploying as infantry in the line for a brief period.

On the 15th the Germans started to withdraw but were caught in the Falaise pocket, allowing the Guards to recover for a refit. Bluecoat had been a success and the combined arms of the battlegroup concept had been proven. This would be the way the Guards Armoured Division would operate from now on. The division suffered many losses in the operation, though the Allies had enough replacements that they could lose six tanks for every German tank destroyed. Crew were a different matter and a consequence of the operation was the removal of the Crusader AA tanks, possible due to the lack of air opposition; their crews were used to man the replacement Shermans provided to the division.

The Guards were not committed to the fighting in the Falaise pocket, but instead got a chance to rest and regroup. On the 27th they were transferred to XXX Corps under Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks and advanced on the River Seine. Due to the near total collapse of the German Army in France they reached and crossed the river on the 29th. Here some more changes were made to the Guards organization. The use of an Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment had not proved successful, while armoured cars had proved more adept at the role, despite the disadvantage of being more tied to the road network. Consequently, the 2nd Household Cavalry were formally attached as the official division reconnaissance element. This freed up the Welsh Guards tank crews for other duties, and formal battlegroups were formed. These were far more organized than the previous ad hoc affair, with each regiment&#x27;s battalions being merged to form a battlegroup. The Grenadier battlegroup consisted of the tanks of the 2nd Battalion and the motor infantry of the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards. This required some rearranging of the division: although occasionally altered, the Grenadier and Irish groups formed the 5th Brigade, and the Coldstream and Welsh groups made the 32nd Brigade. Machine-gun support was provided by the Grenadier Guards for the 5th Brigade and the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers in the 32nd.

Having broken out from Normandy, the terrain change and the countryside became much more open and flowing. The advance was now generally along a road, with the lead elements and Typhoon air support brushing aside most opposition before it could delay the column. The population was grateful for their liberation; the 2nd Household Cavalry, who were generally first into the town, had to keep a sharp eye on stowage and aerials on the exterior of the vehicle lest it be taken as a souvenir. In one town, only the intervention of the police prevented a scout car having its wheels removed. The population were starving, having been deprived of food by the Germans, and supplies and chocolate were dished out to the grateful population. On 3 September Brussels was liberated by the Guards Armoured Division after a high-speed run, the division advancing 75 miles in one day. The division could not rest long however, pushing further into north-east Belgium against stiffening German opposition. After gaining support from the 11th Armoured Division, the Guards reached the border with the Netherlands, the Irish Guards under Joe Vandeleur seizing &quot;Joe&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, a bridge over the Meuse-Escault canal in a surprise assault.

===The Netherlands and Germany===
The Guards Armoured Division was then withdrawn from the line to prepare for Operation Market Garden. They formed the spearhead of the attacks into the Netherlands, with the Grenadier Guards managing to seize the Nijmegen Bridge with the help of the US 82nd Airborne Division. Following this they spent the winter in the Netherlands and Germany, before being moved into Belgium as a reserve against the Battle of the Bulge. The infantry of the Welsh Guards were also replaced by the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, due to a severe lack of replacements in the British Army at the time. Following this the division participated in Operation Veritable, the operation to clear the Reichswald forest. Due to the weather and the Germans flooding the area, only the infantry ended up playing an active part. After this the towed batteries of the Royal Artillery anti-tank guns were converted to infantry for the lack of targets. The division then supported the push over the Rhine before breaking into Germany and fighting up towards the Netherlands and along the German coast. Two Victoria Crosses were awarded to the division for the fighting during this period; neither recipient survived the war. They were Guardsman Edward Charlton of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards and Captain Ian Liddell of the 5th Battalion, Coldstream Guards.

After the German surrender the Guards were mostly involved in mopping up operations and occupation duties. A small detachment was used to test the new Centurion universal tank, six of which had arrived in Germany, too late to be used in the conflict. Eventually the division was selected for conversion back to infantry, and held a &quot;farewell to armour&quot; parade on 9 June 1945; Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery took the final salute.

<text>Roxburghshire or the County of Roxburgh () is a historic county and registration county in the Southern Uplands of Scotland. It borders Dumfriesshire to the west, Selkirkshire and Midlothian to the northwest, and Berwickshire to the north. To the southwest it borders Cumberland and to the southeast Northumberland, both in England.

It was named after the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh, a town which declined markedly in the 15th century and is no longer in existence. Latterly, the county town of Roxburghshire was Jedburgh.

The county has much the same area as Teviotdale, the basin drained by the River Teviot and tributaries, together with the adjacent stretch of the Tweed into which it flows. The term is often treated as synonymous with Roxburghshire, but may omit Liddesdale as Liddel Water drains to the west coast.

== History ==

The county appears to have originated in the 12th century with the creation of the sheriffdom of Roxburgh. The first known sheriff is Gospatric (sheriff of Roxburgh). The hereditary sheriffship of Roxburghshire was possessed by the family of Douglas until the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in the 18th century.

The county was constantly fought over in the Middle Ages as part of the Anglo-Scottish Wars, before the border settled into roughly its modern form with the Treaty of York in 1237. The violence and lawlessness of these times gave rise to the Border Reivers.

The ancient royal burgh of Roxburgh, from which the county had taken its name, fell into decay by the fifteenth century. After the demise of the town of Roxburgh, the county administration was based in Jedburgh, the county town. County Buildings were erected near the market place in 1812, in which the different courts met and the county officials transacted their business.

In 1855 Alexander Jeffrey published his book &quot;The history and antiquities of Roxburghshire and adjacent districts, from the most remote period to the present time&quot;. It ran to four volumes.

==Geography==
Roxburghshire is a predominantly rural county, consisting of low hills rising to the Cheviot Hills along the border with England. Just to the south of Melrose can be found Eildon Hill, a prominent local landmark. There are a few scattered lochs, though none of any significant size.

==Transport==
Other than terminus of the recently re-opened Borders Railway, of which two stations (Galashiels and Tweedbank) lie within the county, there are no railways in Roxburghshire. There were formerly a number of lines serving the county, however these closed as a result of the Beeching cuts.

==Demographics==
The county has a population of 48,639 (in 2011), which is 43% of the population of the Scottish Borders area.

Today, the main towns in the county are (population in 2011):
* Jedburgh — 4,030
* Hawick — 14,294
* Kelso — 5,639
* Melrose — 2,307

Hawick is now by far the largest town, with 29% of the county&#x27;s population. More than half the population live in the two parishes of Hawick and Melrose.

== Administration ==
Today, Roxburghshire is within the Scottish Borders council area for local government purposes and contains the administrative centre of the area, the small town of Newtown St Boswells. It retains official status as a registration county, and falls within the Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale lieutenancy area for ceremonial purposes.

===County===
Until 1975, Roxburghshire was used for local government. The original county town of Roxburgh was abandoned following the destruction of Roxburgh Castle in 1460 during the Anglo-Scottish Wars. Jedburgh then became the county town, serving as the location for the sheriff court and meeting place of the Commissioners of Supply, which were established in 1667 as the county&#x27;s main administrative body. The County Buildings on Castlegate in Jedburgh were built in 1812 to hold the sheriff court and be the meeting place for the commissioners.

The county council was created in 1890, taking most of the commissioners&#x27; functions. From 1890 until 1930 the council met at the County Buildings in Jedburgh. In 1930 the council moved its meeting place and headquarters to Newtown St Boswells. The council already had a branch office on Bowden Road in Newtown St Boswells, which it had built in 1896, and in 1930 the council inherited an adjoining building which had been built in 1928 for the short-lived Roxburghshire Education Authority. The complex became known as the County Offices. A large new building designed by Peter Womersley was added to the site in 1968.

Roxburghshire County Council was abolished in 1975, when local government in Scotland was reorganised into upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Roxburghshire became part of the Borders region. The County Offices at Newtown St Boswells became the headquarters for the new Borders Regional Council. The Duke of Buccleuch and the Duke of Roxburghe between them had held the convenership of Roxburgh County Council for 43 years between 1900 and 1975.

At the time of the county council&#x27;s abolition in 1975, the county contained four burghs and four districts (the districts generally covering the rural areas surrounding the town after which they were named):

*Hawick Burgh
*Jedburgh Royal Burgh
*Kelso Burgh
*Melrose Burgh
*Hawick District
*Jedburgh District
*Kelso District
*Melrose District
===District===

The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 abolished the county council and incorporated its area into the Borders Region. Borders was divided into four districts, one of which was named Roxburgh. Roxburgh District&#x27;s borders broadly resembled those of the historic county, but included the parish of Nenthorn from Berwickshire, and excluded the parishes of Bowden, Lilliesleaf, Maxton, Melrose, and St Boswells, which went instead to the new Ettrick and Lauderdale District. For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Roxburghshire was made lord-lieutenant for the district of Roxburgh when the reforms came into effect in 1975.
Roxburgh District Council was based at Hawick Town Hall which had been built in 1886 for the former Hawick Town Council.

The region and four district councils were abolished in 1996, merging to form the present Scottish Borders council area. A new lieutenancy area was created at the same time, called Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale, covering the combined area of the abolished districts of Roxburgh and neighbouring Ettrick and Lauderdale.

====Political control====
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 until its abolition in 1996 was as follows:
===Coat of arms===
The County of Roxburgh was the first Scottish county to receive a grant of arms. This was made by Lord Lyon King of Arms on 9 July 1798. The coat of arms seems to have been granted for the use of the volunteer and militia units then being organised under the authority of the county&#x27;s lord lieutenant. When the county council was formed in 1890, the arms passed to them.

The shield depicted a unicorn, a national symbol of Scotland. At the top of the shield was a hunting horn between two helmets: probably a reference to the border reivers, one of whom featured in the arms of the royal burgh of Jedburgh. The crest above the shield was an armoured arm brandishing a scimitar. The Latin motto was &quot;Ne Cede Malis Sed Contra Audentior Ito&quot; or &quot;Yield not to misfortunes (evil things) but go on more boldly against them.&quot;, it was a quotation from Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid 6, 95.

On 6 May 1975 the coat of arms was regranted to Roxburgh District Council, without the crest. When the district council was abolished in 1996, the arms reverted to The Crown.


===Civil parishes===

Following the boundary changes carried out under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, the county of Roxburgh contained 30 civil parishes:

*Ancrum (No.12 on map)

<text>Selkirkshire or the County of Selkirk is a historic county and registration county of Scotland. It borders Peeblesshire to the west, Midlothian to the north, Roxburghshire to the east, and Dumfriesshire to the south. It derives its name from its county town, the royal burgh of Selkirk. The county was historically also known as Ettrick Forest.

Unlike many historic counties, Selkirkshire does not have its own lieutenancy area, but forms part of the Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale lieutenancy area.

==History==

In the 1st Century AD Selkirk formed part of the lands of the native people who hunted it rather than settled there. Neither the Romans, Angles, or the Saxons cleared much of the forestry there and for centuries Selkirk was known for its forest coverage. Indeed, an alternative name for the county was Ettrick Forest. Under the Scottish kings the forest was regarded as Royal. Despite this it was not until the reign of James V that sheriffs were appointed to administer the county on the Crown&#x27;s behalf. During the military occupation of Scotland by Edward I of England, the forest was granted to the Earl of Gloucester.

In the Middle Ages the area that would become Selkirkshire formed part of the province of Tweeddale. The origins of the shire are obscure, but sometime around the twelfth century the area of Tweeddale was divided into two sheriffdoms: Peeblesshire to the north and Selkirkshire or Ettrick Forest to the south. The first recorded sheriff of Selkirkshire was Andrew de Synton, who was appointed by William the Lion (d. 1214). Synton in the parish of Ashkirk, just east of the village centre, was an enclave of Selkirkshire surrounded by Roxburghshire.

Later, the Earl of Pembroke assumed the hereditary sheriffdom. Under and after King Robert the Bruce, the Earls of Douglas, and later Earls of Angus administered the county. In 1501 John Murray (d. 1510), laird of Falahill, was made sheriff of Selkirkshire and on 30 Nov. 1509 he obtained a grant of the hereditary sheriffdom of Selkirkshire. His descendant Sir James Murray was deprived of office in 1681 for being remiss in punishing conventicles, but at the Glorious Revolution was raised to the session bench as Lord Philiphaugh and reinstated as sheriff. His son John Murray (died 1753) was the hereditary Sheriff of Selkirk from 1708 to 1734, when he was returned unopposed as MP for Selkirkshire, having resigned his hereditary sheriffdom to one of his sons. When in 1747 the heritable jurisdictions were abolished, Murray of Philiphaugh received £4,000 in compensation. The Sheriff-Deputes, previously appointed by the hereditary sheriffs, were now appointed by the crown and acted in place of the hereditary sheriffs One such sheriff of Selkirkshire was Sir Walter Scott who was appointed Sheriff-Depute in 1799, an office he held until his death in 1832.

Selkirkshire County Council was created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which established elected county councils across Scotland. The 1889 Act also instigated a review of boundaries, particularly where burghs straddled county boundaries. The boundary review for Selkirkshire concluded in 1891 and made a number of mostly minor changes. The most significant change was that the burgh of Galashiels was brought entirely within Selkirkshire, where it had previously been partly in Roxburghshire. Selkirkshire County Council met at the County Buildings on Ettrick Terrace in Selkirk, which had been built in 1870 as a sheriff court and meeting place for the Commissioners of Supply, the main administrative body for the county prior to the creation of the county council. The council&#x27;s staff were based at the Bank of Scotland Buildings in the Market Place in Selkirk. 

The county council was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which reorganised local government in Scotland into upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Selkirkshire became part of the Borders region and part of the Ettrick and Lauderdale district.

At the time of the local government reorganisation in 1975, the posts of lord-lieutenant of Selkirkshire and lord-lieutenant of Roxburghshire were both held by John Scott, 9th Duke of Buccleuch. The new district of Ettrick and Lauderdale and the neighbouring district of Roxburgh became nominally separate lieutenancy areas, although the Duke of Buccleuch was appointed to both positions, effectively continuing the pre-1975 arrangement. When local government was reorganised again in 1996, the two lieutenancies were formally united into a single lieutenancy area called Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale.

Folk ballads written of the county commemorate the Battle of Philiphaugh in 1645, the &#x27;Dowie Dens&#x27; at Yarrow and Tibbie Shiels at St Mary&#x27;s Loch.

==Geography==

Selkirkshire is a rural county, with a handful of small settlements set within hill and forest country. It forms part of the Southern Uplands geographical region. The Ettrick Water and Yarrow Water, both tributaries of the river Tweed, flow through the county. The most prominent loch is St Mary&#x27;s Loch (including the Loch of the Lowes), with smaller lochs being found east of this such as Akermoor Loch, Shaws Under Loch, Shaws Upper Loch, Halemoor Loch, Alemoor Reservoir, Clearburn Loch, Kingside Loch, Crooked Loch and Windylaw Loch. The traditional highest point (county top) of Selkirkshire prior to border changes in the 20th century was Dun Rig, with a height of above sea level.

===Ettrick Forest===
Ettrick Forest, also known as Selkirk and Traquair Forests, is a former royal forest in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland. It is a large area of moorland, south of Peebles, that once stretched from Ayr to Selkirk.

===Keepers of the Forest===
* Simon Fraser of Oliver (d. 1291)
* William Comyn of Kirkintilloch (d. 1291)
* Thomas de Burnham
*Simon Fraser (1299–1306)

==Transport==
The Borders Railway connects Galashiels and Tweedbank with Edinburgh. Closed for many years, this line re-opened in 2015.
There are also buses to Berwick-Upon-Tweed and Carlisle operated by Borders Buses.

== Civil parishes and population ==
Selkirkshire was historically divided into civil parishes. There were originally nine parishes; Ashkirk, Bowside, Buccleuch (or Rankilburn), Duchoire, Ettrick, Kirkhope, Lindean, St Mary&#x27;s (or St Mary of the Lowes) and Selkirk. There have been a number of changes since the medieval period:

* Caddonfoot was created in 1898 from the part of the parish of Stow of Wedale that lay within Selkirkshire.
* Galashiels was formed by the union of two ancient parishes, Bowside and Lindean.
* The parish of Rankilburn or Buccleuch was suppressed and united to Yarrow c. 1600, then transferred to Ettrick 1650.
* The ancient parishes of Duchoire, St Mary&#x27;s and Kirkhope were united to form the parish of Yarrow; Kirkhope was then separated from Yarrow in 1852.

Population of the county by Civil Parish, according to the latest census (2011):


The population of the towns in the county (in 2011):
*Galashiels - 14,994 (of which 12,893 in Selkirkshire)

<doc id="441154" wikidata="Q6823022" url="?curid=441154" title="Metamorphic library steps">
<text>Metamorphic library steps are a type of archaic dual-use furniture, consisting of a small folding staircase that can be transformed into chair or desk form (such as a small writing table or library table). In desk form, it can also be considered a mechanical desk.

Metamorphic library steps were first built in the mid-18th century for the private libraries and offices of the European nobility or the Bourgeoisie. The number of specialised rooms in the typical manor was increasing, so existing ones, like the library, had to use space more efficiently. Consequently, these rooms often had high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. The topmost shelves were difficult to reach, so movable library steps or library stairs were created as a form of domestic furniture.

==Design history==
During the second half of the 18th century a succession of talented German-born cabinet-makers passed through the French courts. Jean-François Oeben, Jean-Henri Riesener and David Roentgen had successively introduced the courts of Louis XV and Louis XVI to a wide range of finely made and exquisitely finished mechanical furniture. The ingenuity of these cabinet-makers, especially David Roentgen who became master cabinet-maker to Marie Antoinette, led to a fascination for &quot;meubles à surprises&quot; (&#x27;surprise furniture&#x27;).

Cabinet-makers working in London based their designs on those of their French counterparts and a number of interesting mechanical furniture devices started to emerge. During the same period the portability of furniture became important. British officers keen to maintain their ‘home comforts’ transported chairs, sofas, dining tables and even four-poster beds into battle. By necessity, these items were designed to be portable and, while they reflected the style of the period, they could also be ‘flat-packed’ for ease of transportation. This ‘flat-pack’ or ‘knock-down furniture’, as it was then known, was also popular for anyone travelling by sea and some items were designed to be multi-purpose to save cabin space. The quality of this ‘campaign furniture’ was so high that the furniture designer and respected protagonist of the emerging English Empire Style, Thomas Sheraton, even recommended certain pieces for the home.

Tables, chairs and stools containing Library Steps were patented in Great Britain by Robert Campbell in 1774 but the chair-based design did not become popular until the second decade of the 19th century. Despite the appeal of the Regency period Metamorphic Library Chair, there is limited information available on the development of the design or the firms that made them. Most design references are based on two outline sketches. The first, by Rudolph Ackermann in 1811, illustrates a Morgan &amp; Sanders chair and the second shows a chair made by Gillows in 1834. The lack of detail in these sketches and the scarcity of research relating to mechanical furniture design of this period, have led to many inaccurate claims.

<doc id="441158" wikidata="Q568102" url="?curid=441158" title="Alexandre Alexeieff">
<text>Alexandre Alexandrovitch Alexeieff (; 18 April 1901 – 9 August 1982) was a Russian-born artist, filmmaker and illustrator who lived and worked mainly in Paris. He and his second wife Claire Parker (1906–1981) are credited with inventing the pinscreen as well as the animation technique totalization. In all Alexeieff produced 6 films on the pinscreen, 41 advertising films and illustrated 41 books.

== Early life ==
Alexeieff was born in the town of Kazan in Russia. He spent his early childhood in Istanbul where his father, Alexei Alexeieff, was a military attaché.

Alexeieff had two older brothers, Vladimir and Nikolai. Vladimir caught syphilis from a Moscow actress with whom he had an affair. His mother forced him to remain in his room and not touch his brothers. The pressure of this was such that Vladimir shot himself. Before he died, he wrote a note to Alexandre saying, &quot;You are very talented. You must keep on drawing&quot;. His second brother, Nikolai, disappeared in Georgia, Russia, during the Russian Revolution of 1917. He was never heard from again; the family suspected that he died of typhus.
In his unpublished memoir &quot;Oublis ou Regrets&quot;, Alexeieff wrote that he rarely saw his father due to the fact that he was often away on missions. He took a daily walk with his mother when he was forced to speak in French instead of Russian. The rest of the time he was under the care of a nanny. Alexieff&#x27;s father died mysteriously in Baden-Baden, Germany on an official trip at the age of 37. He was shot by a Turk, probably because he knew too much about the Middle East. His mother traveled to Germany without telling the children where she was going or why and only when she returned did Alexeieff learn that his father had died.

==After the death of his father==
In his memoirs, Alexeieff describes the tribulations his mother went through after the death of her husband. She first went to stay with her brother-in-law near Odessa, then she went to Riga and finally settled in the town of Gatchina, Russia near Saint Petersburg.

While in Riga, Alexeieff saw a film for the very first time. This made a big impression on the boy. He was surprised to find that the image which was projected on the screen could be seen reflected in the lens of the projector, which happened to be close to where he was sitting. He later realized that the image on the lens was the original one.

When he was seven years old, he was dragged through various government offices by his mother to wait in line in order for the widow to collect the meager pension which had been allotted to her. ”Wait for me here, be a good boy, I shall be back!” she said as she asked the boy to sit and wait on a chair. When she left the room where her son was, he feared as the door closed behind her that she might never return! A boy he knew once told him, ”My mother left too, she never came back!”

In Gatchina, Alexandre often walked alone along the wooden fences of the road nearby. He often called to his brothers who were playing on the other side and said, &quot;Mama died you know... We will have to be kept in school from now on!” He realized later that his mother had sacrificed herself for her sons. However, his mother did return and Alexeieff&#x27;s family settled in Gatchin, a suburb of St. Petersburg and later moved to nearby Lesnoi.

==Cadet Corps School==
Alexeieff entered the Cadet School of Saint Petersburg at the age of seven. His favorite course was drawing. His art teacher taught the students how to draw from memory. He would pass various objects, such as a violin, through the class, remove it and ask the students to draw it. This early training became extremely valuable for Alexeieff later on in life when he became an illustrator. The teacher would also ask them to portray events such as dance or a holiday feast, or read them text and have the students illustrate it, a task Alexeieff particularly enjoyed.

While in the Cadet School, Alexeieff founded a literary magazine which contained works created by students. His friends did not take this project seriously. However, Alexeieff was able to petition for funds and also obtain access to the library which was very valuable to him.

His older brother Vladimir was also a student at the Cadet school. They rarely met but their names were engraved on the wall of the school for having been the best students in their class. Nikolay, who was deaf in one ear, never attended the academy with his brothers.

When the Russian Revolution of 1917 began with general strikes in St. Petersburg, school was closed for three days and Alexeieff returned home to Lesnoi by train. However his brothers Nikolai and Vladimir had not returned and his mother was in a state of panic. Eventually, his brothers did return having been caught as bystanders in a fight between the police and revolutionaries. Shortly thereafter, he received word that Tsar Nicholas the Second had been arrested and abdicated. When Alexeieff was in his teens, he was attracted to communism. However, the arrest and execution of his mother&#x27;s brother by the Bolsheviks led him to rethink his position.

In 1921 Alexeieff was forced to leave the city of Ufa where he had spent the summer with his maternal uncle in order to cross Siberia with a group of cadets. They landed in Vladivostok, where they took the last boat of the Tsar which was in the harbor. The boat went to Egypt where it was purchased by the British who kept the crew in order to transport coal from Southampton to Cairo. During one of the crossings, a storm forced them to anchor in the French Riviera where Alexeieff jumped ship holding on to a letter of recommendation to the Russian set designer Sergei Soudeikin who was living in Paris. Alexeieff started by working designing and painting sets for the Pioteff Theater. He lived in Montparnasse, a bohemian area of Paris.

==Life in Paris==
In 1923 he married Alexandra Alexandrovna Grinevskya (1899–1976), who had been sent to Paris in her childhood because she was the illegitimate daughter of a St. Petersburg dignitary. In order to save the name of his aristocratic family, Alexandra&#x27;s father had not married the mother of his child. Instead, the baby was taken away from her mother at the age of two and adopted by her father&#x27;s sister Katia who kept a musical salon in Paris. Her mother was given a ticket back to Poland, her native country.

When she grew up, Grinevskaya left her aunt to become one of the main actresses in the avant-garde Pitoeff Theater. When Konstantin Stanislavski came to Paris and saw her acting, he offered to have her go back to Russia but Alexandra refused, remaining by Alexeieff&#x27;s side. Their daughter Svetlana was born in 1923.

Alexeieff became well known in this period shortly after illustrating his first rare books. However, he lost one of his lungs while using nitric acid to do his aquatints and was forced to spend two years in a sanatorium. During that time Grinevsky-Alexeieff took his tools and taught herself how to engrave and became the bread winner for the family. While the invention of the pinscreen is often credited to Claire Parker and Alexeieff, Grinevsky-Alexeieff was the first to help Alexeieff build the pinscreen, with the help of her eight-year-old daughter.

==Parker and Alexeieff==
Claire Parker (1910–1981), a well-to-do American art student and graduate of MIT came to France in 1931 to study art. She saw Alexieff&#x27;s work in a bookshop window and got the name of the artist as well as his address from the owner of the bookstore. She was so impressed she arranged to meet him and came to Vaux-le Penail where the Alexeieffs lived. She recalled later, &quot;I figured I would meet an old, dignified man with a white beard... but [instead] I saw this tall, brown, handsome, aristocratic 30-year-old guy. Our first lesson ended on the banks of the Seine, hand in hand; and there was never a second one.&quot;.

Alexeieff and his wife agreed to take Claire as a boarder and as a student. After a few months, Claire became Alexeieff&#x27;s lover. Grinevsky accepted the situation with difficulty. They moved to Paris and rented several artist studios on The Left Bank. They collaborated on various projects. When they started to make films, Claire became the camera person and Grinevsky built and painted the props and sets for the films. However, after the first large pin screen was built, Parker and Alexeieff worked on it alone.

Alexeieff, Parker and Grinevskaya made about 25 stop motion-animated commercials to sustain themselves financially, though they reportedly did not see much difference between their &quot;artistic&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot; films. At times, when making traditional animated films and commercials they also had a fourth partner, animator Etienne Raik. Although most of the commercial and art films are credited to Alexeieff and Parker, it is difficult to separate the contributions of each of the individuals who had formed Alexeieff&#x27;s team. The group included Alexandra Grinevsky, Etienne Raik, Pierre Gorodich and Georges Violet.

Both Grinevsky and Parker greatly contributed to the success of the films. Alexandra was more critical and had a sharper eye, Claire had better technical and mathematical skills. She was more patient with Alexeieff and praised him frequently while Grinevsky looked the other way Claire was quoted by her biographer as saying, “&quot;Between us, he&#x27;s the genius.&quot;

After building the first large pinscreen, Alexeieff and Parker began work on the first pinscreen film in 1931, &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, an adaptation of the piece by Modest Mussorgsky, his favorite Russian composer. The theme of Mussorgsky&#x27;s composition and the film is a witches&#x27; Sabbath on the summer solstice on Mount Triglav near Kiev. However the film is less narrative and more poetic, a succession of images rather than a story. The film took the couple two years to make.

The technique of the pinscreen made it impossible to erase any of the images that had been shot after having drawn them. Once an image was shot, it was impossible to correct it. One had to wait until the film was back from the laboratory. Therefore, two years of work had been conceived in the dark so to speak. Adding to the impermanence of the pinscreen itself, Alexeieff made no sketches for the film, composing each shot in his head and filming them immediately.

The reception at the Pantheon Theater in Paris was extremely encouraging. Newspaper articles were positive, artists and film critics felt that the team had succeeded in creating a more serious type of animation, moving away from cartoons. However, it soon became apparent that working on the pinscreen was time-consuming and therefore costly to use. Consequently, major studios never offered to use the pinscreen with the exception of the National Film Board of Canada.

In 1936 Alexeieff was hired by a German film group in Berlin to lead an animation studio. He made a few animated films for German products and returned to Paris right before the Anschluss, the German annexation of Austria. When the Germans invaded the Netherlands and Belgium in 1940, Alexeieff expected to have German film producers come and ask him make propaganda films which he would have refused to do. Therefore, he packed their old Ford automobile and the family fled south in order to pick up visas at the US Embassy in Bordeaux.

Alexeieff divorced Alexandra Grinevsky and married Claire Parker in 1940 after they arrived in the States. Alexandra and Svetlana lived separately. In 1943, they moved to Canada and produced their second pinscreen film, &quot;In Passing&quot; (&quot;En passant&quot;), with funding from the National Film Board of Canada. It was released in 1944. The four returned to France in 1946.

==Later life==
When Parker and Alexeieff returned to Paris, they made a number of advertising films. Alexeieff invented a technique called Totalization of Illusory Solids or simply Totalization. This process involves filming a moving object at long exposures to capture the trace of the path of motion. The resulting image gives the appearance of a solid object. For example, the path of a pendulum filmed in this fashion would appear to be a solid semicircle. This technique gave their advertisements a unique look.

Alexeieff and Parker also continued to make films using the pin screen. In 1962, they used it to make the prologue to Orson Welles&#x27; film adaptation of Franz Kafka&#x27;s novel &quot;The Trial&quot;. This marks the only mainstream, widely distributed film that Alexeieff and Parker were involved with. The pin-screen was not animated for this sequence. Instead still shots were filmed while Orson Welles read Kafka&#x27;s parable &quot;Before the Law&quot; over it.

&quot;The Nose&quot;, based on Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s satirical short story was released in 1963 and marks the first narrative film made on the pinscreen. The film tells the story of a Russian official who loses his nose and the adventures of the nose itself as well as the barber who finds the nose.

On 7 August 1972, Alexeieff and Parker were invited back to Canada in order to demonstrate the pinscreen to a group of animators at the National Film Board of Canada. This demonstration was filmed, and released by the NFB as &quot;Pin Screen&quot;. This film appears on disk 7 of &quot;Norman McLaren: The Master&#x27;s Edition&quot;, along with &quot;Pinscreen Tests&quot; (1961).

In the same year, they also released another film again, based on Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;. This film used two pinscreens. In front of the main pinscreen, they installed a second, smaller one. This second pinscreen could be rotated thus giving more of an illusion of three-dimensionality. However, the film was never completed.
Their last film, &quot;Three Moods&quot; (&quot;Trois thèmes&quot;), was made on the pinscreen, and first shown in Milan, Italy, in March 1980. It was based on three works by Mussorgsky.

Parker died in 1981 in Paris, and Alexeieff followed Claire by a year. The two are buried in Nice, France. He and Parker left no children.

Although Alexeieff and Parker strove to create serious works of art and shunned any commercialization in their films (excluding their paid work doing advertisements, of course), when asked what her favorite films were, Parker answered &quot;The ones with Tom Mix and his beautiful white horse!&quot;

==The pinscreen==
Alexeieff is most famous for his invention of the pinscreen which he used to make about 6 short films.

The pinboard on which Alexeieff created his extraordinary black and white films is an upright perforated board, three by four feet, into which a million headless steel pins have been inserted. When the pins are pushed forward and lighted obliquely, they create an entirely black surface on the front of the Pinboard. When they are pushed back, the white of the board shows through. In between the pins create various shades of grey.

The first prototype of the pinscreen was made by Alexandra Grinevsky with the help of her daughter Svetlana. It consisted of a canvas perforated with a grid into which pins were inserted. Later on Claire Parker and Alexeieff built the first large pinscreen which was used to film &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;. The Parker family paid for the construction of it.

Alexeieff never made sketches before he created the images on the screen. He conceived each of the stages on the positive side of the screen while Claire worked on the back side of it. Small man made tools were used to produce various patterns on the board. Such everyday instruments as forks, spoons, knives, brushes, cups, prisms and rolling pins were used.

Each of the frames was created one at a time. This painstaking technique demands a lot of attention and ingenuity.

The only follower of Alexeieff, Jacques Drouin of the National Film Board of Canada, has made several films using this technique, most notably &quot;Mindscape (Le Paysagiste)&quot;.

==Legacy==
Svetlana Rockwell (&quot;née&quot; Alexeieff) is an artist who uses pastels and acrylics. She has written her memoirs which describe accurately her family&#x27;s background. Her son, Alexandre Rockwell is an independent film maker in the United States. Alexandre acknowledged the influence his grandfather had on his work, writing in his contribution to &quot;Itineraire d’un Maitre&quot; that &quot;I can safely say there has been no greater influence in my life, and in that I know I am not alone.&quot; &quot;Itineraire d’un Maitre&quot; consists of essays by Yuri Norstein, Nikolay Izvolov, Oleg Kovalov, Georges Nivat, Claudine Eizykman, Guy Fihman, Dominique Willoughby, Svetlana Alexeieff-Rockwell as well as Alexandre Rockwell.

<text>Dumfriesshire or the County of Dumfries or Shire of Dumfries () is a historic county and registration county in southern Scotland. The Dumfries lieutenancy area covers a similar area to the historic county.

In terms of historic counties it borders Kirkcudbrightshire to the west, Ayrshire to the north-west, Lanarkshire, Peeblesshire and Selkirkshire to the north, and Roxburghshire to the east. To the south is the coast of the Solway Firth, and on the other side of the border between Scotland and England the English county of Cumberland.

Dumfriesshire has three traditional subdivisions, based on the three main valleys in the county: Annandale, Eskdale and Nithsdale. These had been independent provinces in medieval times but were gradually superseded as administrative areas by the area controlled by the sheriff of Dumfries, or Dumfriesshire. A Dumfriesshire County Council existed from 1890 until 1975.

Since 1975, the area of the historic county has formed part of the Dumfries and Galloway council area for local government purposes.

==Geography==

The coastline measures . The county slopes very gradually from the mountainous districts of the Southern Uplands in the north, down to the sea; lofty hills alternating in parts with stretches of tableland or rich fertile holms. At various points within a few miles of the Solway are tracts of moss land, like Craigs Moss, Lochar Moss and Longbridge Moor in the west, and Nutberry Moss in the east, all once under water, but since largely reclaimed.

The principal mountains occur near the northern boundaries, the highest being White Coomb (), Hart Fell (), Saddle Yoke (), Swatte Fell (), Lowther Hills (), Queensbury () and Ettrick Pen ().

The three longest rivers are the River Nith, the River Annan and the River Esk, the basins of which form the great dales by which the county is cloven from north to south — Nithsdale, Annandale and Eskdale. From the point where it enters Dumfriesshire, from its source near Enoch Hill in Ayrshire, the course of the Nith is mainly south-easterly until it enters the Solway, a few miles below Dumfries. Its total length is 65 mi., and its chief affluents are, on the right, the Kello Water, Euchan Water, Scaur Water, Cluden Water and River Cargen, Cargen, and — on the left — the River Crawick, Carron Water and River Campie.
The Annan rises near the Devil&#x27;s Beef Tub, a remarkable chasm in the far north, and after flowing about , mainly in a southerly course, it enters the Solway at Barnkirk Headlands and bays. It receives, on the right, the Kinnel Water (reinforced by the Water of Ae), and — on the left — the Moffat Water, the Dryfe Water and the Water of Milk.

From the confluence of the White Esk (rising near Ettrick Pen) and the Black Esk (rising near Jocks Shoulder, ) the Esk flows in a gradually south-easterly direction until it crosses the Border, whence it sweeps to the southwest through the extreme north-western territory of Cumberland and falls into the Solway. Of its total course of , belong to the White Esk, are of the Esk proper on Scottish soil and are of the stream in its English course. On the right the Wauchope Water is the chief affluent, and on the left it receives the Meggat Water, Ewes Water, Tarras Water, Liddel Water and River Lyne — the last being an English tributary, and the previous forming the border between Roxburghshire and Cumberland.

Other rivers are the Lochar Water (), the Kirtle Water () and the River Sark (), all flowing into the Solway. For of its course the Esk, and for of its course the River Sark, form the boundaries between Dumfriesshire and Cumberland. Between the Esk and Sark lies Scots&#x27; Dyke, a man-made berm that forms the Anglo-Scottish border, cutting through the area formerly known as the Debatable Lands.

Loch Skeen in the north ( above the sea) and the group of lochs around Lochmaben, are the principal lakes. There are few glens so named in the shire, but the passes of Dalveen, Enterkin and Menock, leading up from Nithsdale to the Lowther and other hills, yield to few glens in Scotland in the wild grandeur of their scenery. For part of the way Enterkin Pass runs between mountains rising sheer from the burn to a height of nearly Loch Skene finds an outlet in Tail Burn, the water of which at a short distance from the lake leaps from a height of in a fine waterfall, known as the Grey Mare&#x27;s Tail. A much smaller but picturesque fall of the same name, also known as Crichope Linn, occurs on the Crichope near Thornhill. Mineral waters are found at Moffat, Hartfell Spa, some farther north, Closeburn and Brow on the Solway.

==Geology==

The greater portion of the county of Dumfries belongs to the Silurian tableland of the south of Scotland which contains representatives of all the divisions of that system from the Arenig to the Ludlow rocks.

By far the largest area is occupied by strata of Tarannon and Llandovery age which cover a belt of country from across from Drumlanrig Castle in the north to Torthorwald in the south. Consisting of massive grits, sometimes conglomeratic, greywackes, flags and shales, these beds are repeated by innumerable folds frequently inverted, striking northeast and southwest and usually dipping towards the northwest. In the midst of this belt there are lenticular bands of older strata of Arenig, Llandeilo, Caradoc and Llandovery age composed of fine sediments such as cherts, black and grey shales, white clays and flags, which come to the surface along anticlinal folds and yield abundant graptolites characteristic of these divisions.

These black shale bands are typically developed in Moffatdale; indeed the three typical sections chosen by Charles Lapworth to illustrate his three great groups:
:(1) the Glenkill shales (Upper Llandeilo),
:(2) the Hartfell shales (Caradoc),
:(3) Birkhill shales (Lower Llandovery) occur respectively in the Glenkill Burn north of Kirkmichael, on Hartfell and in Dobbs Linn near St Mary&#x27;s Loch in the basin of the river Annan.

In the extreme northwest of the county between Drumlanrig Castle and Dalveen Pass in the south and the Spango and Kello Waters on the north, there is a broad development of Arenig, Liandeilo and Caradoc strata, represented by Radiolarian cherts, black shales, grits, conglomerates, greywackes and shales which rise from underneath the central Tarannon belt and are repeated by innumerable folds, in the cores of the arches of Arenig cherts there are diabase lavas, tuffs and agglomerates which are typically represented on Bail Hill east of Kirkconnel. Along the southern margin of the Tarannon belt, the Wenlock and Ludlow rocks follow in normal order, the boundary between the two being defined by a line extending from the head of the Ewes Water in Eskdale, southwest by Lockerbie to Mouswald. These consist of greywackes, flags and shales with bands of dark graptolite shales, the finer sediments being often well ground. They are likewise repeated by inverted folds, the axial planes being usually inclined to the southeast. The Silurian tableland in the northwest of the county is pierced by intrusive igneous rocks in the form of dikes and bosses, which are regarded as of Lower Old Red Sandstone age. Of these, the granite mass of Spango Water, northeast of Kirkconnel, is an excellent example. Along the northwest margin of the county, on the north side of the fault bounding the Silurian tableland, the Lower Old Red Sandstone occurs, where it consists of sandstones and conglomerates associated with contemporaneous volcanic rocks. The Upper Old Red Sandstone forms a narrow strip on the south side of the Silurian tableland, resting uncomfortably on the Silurian rocks and passing upwards into the Carboniferous formation. It stretches from the county boundary east of the Ewes Water, southwest by Langholm to Birrenswark. Along this line these Upper Red sandstones and shales are overlaid by a thin zone of volcanic rocks which point to contemporaneous volcanic action in this region at the beginning of the Carboniferous period. Some of the vents from which these igneous materials may have been discharged are found along the watershed between Liddesdale and Teviotdale in Roxburghshire.

The strata of Carboniferous age are found in three areas: 
:(1) between Sanquhar and Kirkconnel,
:(2) at Closeburn near Thornhill,
:(3) in the district between Liddesdale and Ruthwell.

In the first two instances (Sanquhar and Thornhill) the Carboniferous sediments lie in hollows worn out of the old Silurian tableland. In the Sanquhar basin the strata belong to the Coal Measures, and include several valuable coal-seams which are probably the southern prolongations of the members of this division in Ayrshire. At the S.E. limit of the Sanquhar Coalfield there are patches of the Carboniferous Limestone series, but towards the N. these are overlapped by the Coal Measures which thus rest directly on the Silurian platform. At Closeburn and Barjarg there are beds of marine limestone, associated with sandstones and shales which probably represent marine bands in the Carboniferous Limestone series.

The most important development of Carboniferous strata occurs between Liddesdale and Ruthwell. In the valleys of the Liddel and the Esk the following zones are represented, which are given in ascending order: 
:(1) The Whita Sandstone,
:(2) the Cementstone group,
:(3) the Fell Sandstone,
:(4) the Glencartholm Volcanic Group,
:(5) Marine limestone group with Coal-seams,
:(6) Millstone Grit,
:(7) Rowanburn coal group,
:(8) Byreburn coal group,
:(9) Red Sandstones of Canonbie yielding plants characteristic of the Upper Coal Measures.

The coal seams of the Rowanburn field have been chiefly wrought, and in view of their exhaustion bores have been sunk to prove the coals beneath the red sandstone of upper Carboniferous age. From a palaeontological point of view the Glencartholm volcanic zone is of special interest, as the calcareous shale associated with the tuffs has yielded a large number of new species of fishes, decapod crustaceans, phyllopods and scorpions. The Triassic rocks rest uncomfortably on all older formations within the county. In the tract along the Solway Firth they repose on the folded and eroded edges of the Carboniferous strata, and when traced westwards to the Dumfries basin they rest directly on the Silurian platform. They occur in five areas:

:(1) between Annan and the mouth of the Esk (the Scottish portion of the Solway Basin),
:(2) the Dumfries basin (Lower Nithsdale),
:(3) the Thornhill basin (Middle Nithsdale),
:(4) the Lochmaben basin (Middle Annandale),
:(5) Upper Annandale.

The strata consist of breccia, false-bedded sandstones and mans, the sandstones being extensively quarried for building purposes. In the sandstones of Corncockle Moor reptilian footprints have been obtained. In the Thornhill basin there is a thin zone of volcanic rocks at the base of this series which are evidently on-the horizon of the lavas beneath the Mauchline sandstones in Ayrshire. In the Sanquhar basin there are small outliers of lavas probably of this age and several vents filled with agglomerate from which these igneous materials in the Thornhill basin may have been derived. There are several striking examples of basalt dikes of Tertiary age, one having been traced from the Lead Hills south-east by Moffat, across Eskdalemuir to the English border.

==Climate and industries==

The climate is mild, with a mean annual temperature of around (January, ; July, ), and the average annual rainfall is 53 in. Towards the middle of the 18th century farmers began to raise stock for the south, and a hundred years later 20,000 head of heavy cattle were sent yearly to the English markets. The Galloways, which were the breed in vogue at first, have been to a large extent replaced by shorthorns and Ayrshire dairy cattle. Sheep breeding, of later origin, has attained to remarkable dimensions, the walks in the higher hilly country being given over to Cheviots, and the richer pasture of the low-lying farms being reserved for half-bred lambs, a cross of Cheviots and Leicesters or other long-woolled rams. Pig-feeding, once important, has declined before the imports of bacon from foreign countries. Horse breeding is pursued on a considerable scale. Grain crops, of which oats are the principal, show a downward tendency. Arable farms range from , and pastoral from .

In general the industries are only of local importance and mostly confined to Dumfries and a few of the larger towns. Langholm is famous for its tweeds; breweries and distilleries are found at Annan, Sanquhar and elsewhere; some shipping is carried on at Annan and Dumfries; and the salmon fisheries of the Nith and Annan and the Solway Firth are of value.

==Communications==

As built, the Glasgow and South Western Railway from Glasgow to Carlisle runs through Nithsdale to Dumfries, practically following the course of the River Nith, then on to Annan and lower Annandale to the English border at Gretna. A branch was built from Dumfries to Moniaive, the Cairn Valley Light Railway, but this closed in 1949.

The Caledonian Railway from Carlisle to Glasgow runs through Annandale, which threw off at Beattock a small branch to Moffat, now closed. At Lockerbie a cross-country line to Dumfries (now closed), and at Kirtlebridge a line that ultimately crossed the Solway to Bowness which is also closed.

From Dumfries westwards there were rail communications on the &#x27;Port Road&#x27; to Castle Douglas, Newton Stewart, Stranraer and Portpatrick, with branches to Kirkcudbright and Wigtown all closed and lifted.

The North British Railway&#x27;s Waverley route, to Edinburgh from Carlisle was closed in the 1960s. There are vague plans to reopen this line to Carlisle as a continuation of the new rail link from Edinburgh to Tweedbank opened in 2015. Until 1967 the North British Railway sent a short line to Langholm (via Canonbie and Gilnockie) from Riddings Junction in Cumberland, giving access to Carlisle. The last passenger train ran on the Langholm branch on 26 March 1967, the last freight service on 17 September in the same year, and the track was lifted shortly thereafter.

There is also an extensive local bus and coach network throughout the county, centred on Dumfries.

There are no commercial airports in the county.

==History==
Archaeological remains from the neolithic and Bronze Age include stone circles (as in Dunscore and Eskdalemuir), tumuli and cairns (Closeburn), and sculptured stones (Dornock). A number of bank barrows and cursus have recently been discovered.

The Brittonic tribe which inhabited this part of Scotland was called by the Romans &quot;Selgovae&quot;. They have left many signs of their presence, such as hill forts and camps (Dryfesdale). The country around Moffat especially is rich in remains.

There are traces of the Roman roads which ran by Dalveen Pass into Clydesdale and up the Annan to Tweeddale, and the ruins of Blatobulgium at Birrens is one of the best-preserved examples of a Roman camp. Roman altars, urns, and coins are found in many places.

After the withdrawal of Roman power from Britain, the situation in Dumfries is not clear. The lands of the Selgovae were incorporated into the larger Brittonic-speaking kingdom of Strathclyde but over time came under pressure, by Gaels from Ireland, Angles from Northumbria and Vikings from Scandinavia. There is little writing preserved from this time, and that which remains is ecclesiastical in nature. Archaeology, although rich on the ground, has rarely been investigated, and place names, used as an indication of influence, are still argued over by academics.

In the parish church of Ruthwell (pronounced &quot;Rivvel&quot;: the rood, or cross, well) is preserved an ancient Anglo-Saxon cross which tells in runic characters the story of the Crucifixion. The conquest of Dumfriesshire by Angles does not seem to have been thorough in the West, where Gaelic-speaking invaders held sway, the people of Nithsdale and elsewhere maintaining some Celtic institutions up to the time of David I, although this is not certain. Around 50 fragments of gilt bronze mounts found in Dumfriesshire and now at the National Museum of Scotland were probably originally attached to a portable wooden cross, .

As a Border county, Dumfriesshire was the scene of stirring deeds at various epochs, especially in the days of Robert Bruce. Edward I besieged Caerlaverock Castle, and the factions of Bruce (who was lord of Annandale), John Comyn and John Baliol were at constant feud. The Border clans were always at strife. There is record of a bloody fight in Dryfesdale in 1593, when the Johnstones slew 700 Maxwells, and, overtaking the fugitives at Lockerbie, there massacred most of the remnant. These factions embroiled the dalesmen until the 18th century. The uplands of the shire afforded retreat to the persecuted Covenanters, who, at Sanquhar, published in 1680 their declaration against the king, anticipating the principles of the glorious Revolution by several years. Prince Charles Edward’s ambition left the shire comparatively untouched, for the Jacobite sentiment made little appeal to the people.
Dumfriesshire is inseparably connected with the name of Robert Burns, who farmed at Ellisland Farm on the Nith for three years, and spent the last five years of his life in Dumfries. Thomas Carlyle was born at Ecclefechan, in a house still standing, and was buried beside his parents in the kirkyard of the old Secession church (now the United Free). His farm of Craigenputtock was left to Edinburgh University in order to found the John Welsh bursaries in classics and mathematics.

Folk history suggests that at Holywood, near Dumfries, there stand the relic of the grove of sacred oaks from which the place derived its name, and a stone circle known locally as the Twelve Apostles.

In 1988 Dumfriesshire was the site of the Lockerbie bombing, in which a bomb exploded on an aircraft flying over the town of Lockerbie, killing a total of 270 people. It remains the worst single terrorist attack in British history.

===Administrative history===
The origins of Dumfriesshire as a county or shire are obscure. There was certainly a shire of Dumfries by 1305, with some suggestion that it had existed from the twelfth century. Annandale and Eskdale retained a degree of independence from the sheriff of Dumfries, leaving the sheriff&#x27;s practical control focussed on the Nithsdale area until 1747 when the separate jurisdictions of Annandale and Eskdale were ended under the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746.

Commissioners of Supply were created in 1667 for each shire, and formed the main administrative body for the area until county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries of many of Scotland&#x27;s counties; in the case of Dumfriesshire the two parishes of Moffat and Kirkpatrick-Juxta, which had previously both straddled Dumfriesshire and Lanarkshire, were brought entirely within Dumfriesshire. Dumfriesshire County Council was based at County Buildings on English Street in Dumfries. In May 1975 the county council was abolished and its functions were transferred to Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Two lower-tier district councils were created from parts of Dumfriesshire, being Annandale and Eskdale covering the east of the county and Nithsdale covering the west of the county and a small part of neighbouring Kirkcudbrightshire.

For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Dumfriesshire was made lord-lieutenant for the combined area of the Nithsdale and Annandale and Eskdale districts when the reforms came into effect in 1975. The districts were abolished in 1996, with their functions passing to Dumfries and Galloway Council. The Dumfries lieutenancy area continues to cover the combined area of the pre-1996 Nithsdale and Annandale and Eskdale districts.

<text>The County of Kinross or Kinross-shire is a historic county and registration county in eastern Scotland, administered as part of Perth and Kinross since 1975. Surrounding its largest settlement and county town of Kinross, the county borders Perthshire to the north and Fife to the east, south and west.

Scotland&#x27;s second smallest county, Kinross-shire is dominated by Loch Leven, a large inland loch, with two islands and an internationally important nature reserve. One of the islands contains a castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots was once held prisoner. Much of the land in Kinross-shire is fertile agricultural land and most of the inhabitants were originally employed in farming. The gently-rolling farmland surrounding Loch Leven gives way to steep, more rugged terrain at the outskirts of the county.

==History==
===Administrative history===
The Kinross-shire area was anciently part of the province of Fothriff. By the early thirteenth century, Fothriff had been joined to the earldom of Fife. Sometime between the reign of David I (reigned 1124–1153) and the mid-thirteenth century, this part of Scotland was divided into shires, being areas administered by a sheriff. By 1252 there was a sheriff of Kinross, initially with authority over just the two parishes of Kinross and Orwell.

Over time, Scotland&#x27;s shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. The larger earldom of Fife was therefore gradually eclipsed in importance by the smaller shire of Fife and the two other small shires within the earldom, being Kinross-shire and Clackmannanshire. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Cleish, Portmoak and Tullibole were added to Kinross-shire in 1685. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term &quot;county&quot; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &quot;shire&quot;.
Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). Kinross County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the County Buildings in Kinross, the courthouse (built 1826) which also served as the meeting place for the commissioners.

The 1889 Act also led to a review of boundaries, with exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parishes which straddled more than one county being adjusted such that each parish was entirely in a single county. There were several such changes affecting the boundaries of Kinross-shire.

Kinross-shire was the least populous of the Scottish counties at the 1921 census, with fewer than 8,000 people. Due to its low population, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 combined the county councils of Kinross-shire and neighbouring Perthshire for most purposes in 1930. The two councils continued to be elected as separate bodies, but operated together as the &quot;Perth and Kinross Joint County Council&quot;, serving the combined area of the two counties.

Kinross County Council did perform some roles alone after 1930, notably acting as the district council for Kinross-shire, which was considered too small to be divided into districts. The county council remained based at the County Buildings until its abolition in 1975.

Kinross-shire was abolished as an administrative area in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Kinross-shire became part of the Perth and Kinross district in the Central region. Further local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with council areas providing all local government services. Perth and Kinross district became one of the new council areas. The boundaries of the historic county of Kinross-shire are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

===Economic history===
The county suffered a decline in population in the 19th and 20th centuries, as its inhabitants migrated to the cities to find work in manufacturing, etc. The population in 1891 was 6,673; in 1971 it was 6,423. The decline was hastened by the closure of the railways in the county soon after the Second World War. However, in recent years, construction of the M90 motorway north of the Forth Road Bridge has resulted in the area becoming more prominent. Tourism has increased, with visitors attracted by the unspoiled country villages and gently rolling hills reaching the shores of Loch Leven. The villages of Kinnesswood and Scotlandwell are attractive, and there are ancient standing stones at Orwell. The T in the Park music festival was held in Balado from 1993 to 2014.

The economic outlook of Kinross-shire has improved and was recorded in 2009 as having an estimated population of 12,997. In addition, it outperformed both the Perth and Kinross area and Scotland averages in economic performance. The area is promoted by the Kinross-shire Partnership, a body bringing together local government, tourist organisations and local organisations.

==Geography==
Kinross-shire is landlocked and is generally flat, except in the north-west where the Ochil Hills are located, and along the southern boundary where the Cleish Hills can be found. The Ochils contain Innerdouny Hill, Kinross-shire&#x27;s highest point at 497 m (1,631 ft). The most notable geographic feature of the county is Loch Leven which is also an important nature reserve; there are also several islands within the loch, the largest of which is St Serf&#x27;s Inch (the others are Alice&#x27;s Bower, Castle Island, Reed Bower, Roy&#x27;s Folly and Scart Island). A much smaller body of water – the Arnot Reservoir – is located to the east of Loch Leven. On the far northern border a portion of the Glenfarg Reservoir lies within the county.

==Subdivisions==

===Burgh of Kinross===
Kinross-shire contained only one burgh, Kinross. The burgh was originally created a burgh of barony in 1540/1 and became a burgh of regality in 1685. In 1864 it became a police burgh with an elected town council. It continued to exist until 1975.

===Civil parishes===

The county was anciently divided into a number of parishes: Cleish, Orwell (containing the market town of Milnathort), Kinross and Portmoak were entirely in Kinross-shire. The parishes of Arngask, Fossoway, Tulliebole and Forgandenny were partly in Perthshire. From 1845 they were used for local government purposes and governed by parochial boards.

The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 created a boundary commission to ensure that all civil parishes lay within a single county. After the boundary changes the county contained five parishes: Fossoway (No. 1 on map), Orwell (2), Kinross (3), Portmoak (4) and Cleish (5).

From 1894 elected parish councils replaced the parochial boards. These in turn were abolished in 1930, and the powers they had exercised passed to the county council. Parishes continue to be used today for statistical purposes, though they no longer have any administrative function.

==Transport==
Kinross-shire is bisected north–south by the M90 motorway, which links Kinross to Perth in the north and Dunfermline in the south. The A911 enables west to east travel across the county.

There are no railway stations; previously there was one at Kinross however this is no longer open.

==Parliamentary constituency==
===Historic===

From 1426 the county returned one member to the Parliament of Scotland.

===United Kingdom parliament===

Following the Act of Union, Kinross-shire returned members to the House of Commons in Westminster. Due to its small population, it was never a constituency in its own right: instead it alternated with Clackmannanshire, a member being returned for one county at one parliament and for the other at the next.
The Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832 merged the two counties into a single constituency, Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire.

In 1918, House of Commons seats were redistributed, and Kinross-shire was combined with part of Perthshire to form the constituency of Kinross and Western Perthshire. This constituency continued in existence until 1983.

==Coat of arms==
The Kinross County Council received a grant of arms from Lord Lyon King of Arms on 18 May 1927. The arms depict Lochleven Castle. The motto adopted was &quot;for all time&quot;: at the time of the grant the county council was campaigning to retain its independence from its larger neighbour Perthshire.

When Perth and Kinross District Council was granted arms in 1977, the Kinross-shire arms were placed on an &quot;inescutcheon&quot;, or small shield, in the centre of the new arms. These arms continue in use by the current Perth and Kinross Council.

<text>Stirlingshire or the County of Stirling ( ) is a historic county and registration county of Scotland. Its county town is Stirling.

It borders Perthshire to the north, Clackmannanshire to the east, West Lothian to the south-east, Lanarkshire to the south, and Dunbartonshire to the south and south-west (this latter boundary is split in two owing to Dunbartonshire&#x27;s Cumbernauld exclave).

==History==
In 1130, Stirling, one of the principal royal strongholds of the Kingdom of Scotland, was created a royal burgh by King David I.

On 11 September 1297, the forces of Andrew Moray and William Wallace defeated the combined English forces of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Cressingham near Stirling, on the River Forth, at the Battle of Stirling Bridge during the First War of Scottish Independence.

On 22 July 1298 the Battle of Falkirk saw the defeat of William Wallace by King Edward I of England.
On 24 June 1314 the Battle of Bannockburn at Bannockburn, (&quot;Blàr Allt a&#x27; Bhonnaich&quot; in Scottish Gaelic) was a significant Scottish victory in the Wars of Scottish Independence. It was one of the decisive battles of the First War of Scottish Independence.

On 11 June 1488 the Battle of Sauchieburn was fought at the side of Sauchie Burn, a stream about two miles south of Stirling. The battle was fought between the followers of King James III of Scotland and a large group of rebellious Scottish nobles including Alexander Home, 1st Lord Home, nominally led by the king&#x27;s 15-year-old son, Prince James, Duke of Rothesay (reigned 1488–1513).

In 1645 the Covenanter army under General William Baillie formed near Banton for their engagement with the Royalist forces under the command of Montrose at the Battle of Kilsyth, Kilsyth, on 15 August 1645; a major battle of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.

The Battle of Falkirk Muir on 17 January 1746 saw the Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart defeat a government army commanded by Lieutenant General Henry Hawley.

===Administrative history===
Stirlingshire&#x27;s origins as a shire (the area administered by a sheriff) are obscure, but it seems to have been created during the reign of David I (reigned 1124–1153), who had also made Stirling a burgh. The precise extent of the early shire is unknown; it is thought that it originally covered a relatively small area in the immediate vicinity of Stirling itself, but subsequently gained territory from neighbouring shires, notably from West Lothian to the south and Dunbartonshire to the south-west. The boundary with Dunbartonshire in particular was altered several times. In the thirteenth century an area north-east of Loch Lomond was transferred from Dunbartonshire to Stirlingshire, whilst the two parishes of Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld were transferred from Stirlingshire to Dunbartonshire, despite not adjoining the rest of Dunbartonshire. These changes were reversed in 1504, when Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld were restored to Stirlingshire and the area north-east of Loch Lomond went back to Dunbartonshire, but the change was short-lived, being reverted again in 1509.
Commissioners of Supply were established in 1667 to act as the main administrative body for the shire. Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The burgh of Stirling was deemed capable of managing its own affairs and so was excluded from the administrative area of the county council, although the county council still chose to base itself there. Stirlingshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the County Buildings (which also served as the sheriff court) on Barnton Street in Stirling, which had been built in 1875.

The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries, with several exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parishes which straddled more than one county being adjusted such that each parish was entirely in a single county. These changes saw Stirlingshire cede Milngavie to Dunbartonshire, Alva to Clackmannanshire, and part of the parish of Lecropt to Perthshire. In return Stirlingshire gained Cambuskenneth from Clackmannanshire, the part of Kippen parish which had been in Perthshire, and all of an adjusted Logie parish (which had previously straddled Stirlingshire, Clackmannanshire and Perthshire).
Until 1930 the county council met at the County Buildings. Reforms in 1930 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 saw the burgh of Stirling brought within the administrative area of the county council, and the county council take over the functions of the formerly separate Stirlingshire Education Authority. The education authority had bought the former Royal Infirmary building at 33 Spittal Street in Stirling in 1929 to use as its headquarters. The county council moved its meeting place to Spittal Street in 1930, but still needed more office space for its staff. In 1931 the council bought a house called Viewforth on Pitt Terrace, where it built a large extension including a council chamber, which was completed in 1937. Viewforth then served as the county council&#x27;s headquarters until its abolition in 1975.

Stirlingshire was abolished for local government purposes in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of regions and districts. Most of Stirlingshire became part of the Central region, while a smaller area around Kilsyth went instead to Strathclyde region. At the district level, the county was divided between four districts, all of which also incorporated territory from other counties: Stirling district and Falkirk district in Central region and Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district and Strathkelvin district in Strathclyde region. A Stirling and Falkirk lieutenancy area was created covering the Stirling and Falkirk districts, and the last Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire became the first Lord Lieutenant of Stirling and Falkirk.

Further local government reforms in 1996 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with council areas providing all local government services. Since 1996 the area of the pre-1975 county of Stirlingshire has straddled the four council areas of East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, North Lanarkshire, and Stirling.

The pre-1975 boundaries of Stirlingshire are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

==Coat of arms==
Stirlingshire County Council was granted a coat of arms by Lord Lyon King of Arms on 29 September 1890. The design of the arms commemorated the Scottish victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in the county.

On the silver saltire on blue of St Andrew was placed the rampant red lion from the royal arms of Scotland. Around this were placed two caltraps and two spur-rowels recalling the use of the weapons against the English cavalry.

On the abolition of the county council in 1975, the arms were regranted to Stirling District Council. They were regranted a second time in 1996 to the present Stirling Council, with the addition of supporters (a goshawk and a wolf).

==Geography==
Stirlingshire occupies a strategic position on the Forth-Clyde isthmus commanding the main overland routes from Glasgow and Edinburgh up to central and northern Scotland.
The western &#x27;arm&#x27; of the county is sparsely populated and dominated by Loch Lomond, which it shares with Dunbartonshire, and the Trossachs (now a national park); Ben Lomond is located here and is the highest point in Stirlingshire at and ninth highest peak in Scotland. Several islands within Loch Lomond belong to Stirlingshire, the chief of these being Eilean nan Deargannan, Bucinch, Ceardach, Inchcruin, Inchfad, Ellanderroch, Inchcailloch and Clairinsh. On the north-eastern boundary with Perthshire a small portion of Loch Katrine lies within Stirlingshire, and also the smaller Loch Arklet can be found here.
Central Stirlingshire contains the Carron Valley Reservoir and the Campsie Fells, Kilsyth Hills and Gargunnock Hills, with the larger towns such as Lennoxtown and Kilsyth spread out along the southern border and A891/A803 roads. The south-western corner of the county around Milngavie (transferred to Dunbartonshire in 1891) abuts the Greater Glasgow conurbation and contains several small reservoirs and lochs, such as Burncrooks Reservoir, Kilmannan Reservoir, Carbeth Loch, Craigallian Loch, Dumbrock Loch, Mugdock Loch, Mugdock/Craigmaddie Reservoir and Bardowie Loch.

The area east of the M80 is generally much flatter and contains the bulk of the county&#x27;s population, with the Firth of Forth providing access to the North Sea.

==Transport==
The bulk of Stirlingshire&#x27;s motorway network lies in the eastern third of the county where the population is most concentrated; these include the M80 running north–south and connecting Stirling and Denny to Cumbernauld, and the M9 linking the eastern towns to Edinburgh. Various A roads form a circle around central Stirlingshire, with the rest of the county served by B roads.

Various ferries enable passengers to cross Loch Lomond in the far west, and the Kincardine Bridge in the far east provides access to Fife and Clackmannanshire.

Only the eastern third of the county is connected by rail, although Milngavie railway station was in the far south-west of Stirlingshire when first built, being transferred to Dunbartonshire in 1891. The railways in the east connect the towns there to each other and on to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cumbernauld and Perth.

==Subdivisions==
===Burghs===

*The Royal Burgh of Stirling (from the 12th century) (No. 2 on map)
*The Burgh of Bridge of Allan (a police burgh from 1870) (1)
*The Burgh of Denny and Dunipace (a police burgh from 1877) (4)
*The Burgh of Falkirk (a burgh of barony from 1600, reformed 1832) (5)
*The Burgh of Grangemouth (a police burgh from 1877) (6)
*The Burgh of Kilsyth (a burgh of barony from 1620, a police burgh from 1878) (3)

The royal burgh of Stirling was administratively independent from the county council until 1930. In 1930 Stirling was brought into the administrative area of the county council, and Stirling and Falkirk were both designated large burghs, giving them the power to run many (but not all) local government services. The remaining four burghs became small burghs, with more limited powers.

===Parishes===
In 2001, according to the website of the General Register Office for Scotland, there were 871 civil parishes.

Civil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.

Following the boundary changes caused by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, Stirlingshire contained the following civil parishes:

*Airth (No.1 on Map A)
*Baldernock (2)
*Balfron (3)
*Bothkennar (4)
*Buchanan (5)
*Campsie (6)
*Denny (7)
*Drymen (8) 
*Dunipace (9)
*Falkirk (10)
*Fintry (11)
*Gargunnock (12)
*Killearn (13)
*Kilsyth (14)
*Kippen (15)
*Larbert (16)
*Logie (23)
*Muiravonside (refer Maddiston) (17) 
*Polmont (18)
*St. Ninians (19)
*Slamannan (20)
*Strathblane (21)
*Stirling (22)
In 1894 parish councils were established for the civil parishes, replacing the previous parochial boards. The parish councils were abolished in 1930, after which the parishes had no administrative functions.

===Landward districts===
In 1930 the landward area of the county (the part outside the burghs) was divided into eight districts. These districts were abolished in 1975.
*Central No.1
*Central No.2 (Denny, Dunipace and Kilsyth areas)
*Eastern No.1 (parishes of Airth and Larbert)
*Eastern No.2 (Falkirk and Slamannan)
*Eastern No.3 (parishes of Polmont and Muiravonside)
*Western No.1
*Western No.2
*Western No.3 (Baldernock, Campsie, Strathblane)

==Parliamentary constituencies==
Following the Act of Union, Stirlingshire returned members to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1708.

===1707–1918===
*The Royal Burgh of Stirling formed part of the Stirling burghs constituency along with burghs in Fife and Perthshire.
*The Burgh of Falkirk formed part of Falkirk Burghs, along with burghs in Lanarkshire and Linlithgowshire.
*The remainder of the county returned a single member as the parliamentary county of Stirlingshire. The detached parish of Alva was annexed to the constituency of Clackmannanshire and Kinross by the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832.

===1918–1975===
In 1918 seats in the House of Commons were redistributed. Stirlingshire was thereafter represented by three members of parliament.
*The burghs of Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth formed the Stirling and Falkirk burghs constituency. in 1974 the constituency was renamed Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth.
*The eastern part of the county (defined in 1948 and 1970 as the Eastern No. 1, Eastern No. 2 and Eastern No. 3 Districts) was combined with Clackmannanshire to form Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire.
*The remainder of the county was included in the constituency of West Stirlingshire (named Stirling and Clackmannan West until 1945). The area included in the constituency was defined in 1948 and 1970 as the burghs of Bridge of Allan, Denny and Dunipace and Kilsyth; and the Central No. 1, Central No. 2, Western No. 1, Western No. 2 and Western No. 3 districts.

These boundaries continued in use until 1983, when new constituencies were formed based on the Local Government regions and districts created in 1975.

<doc id="441170" wikidata="Q1887320" url="?curid=441170" title="Yehudi Menuhin School">
<text>The Yehudi Menuhin School is a specialist music school in Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, Surrey, England, founded in 1963 by violinist and conductor Yehudi Menuhin. The current director of music is the British classical pianist Ashley Wass. The school is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in the United Kingdom, along with Chetham&#x27;s School of Music, Wells Cathedral School, the Purcell School and St. Mary&#x27;s Music School, Edinburgh. It is mainly funded by the Department for Education&#x27;s Music and Dance Scheme, by philanthropic foundations, by donations and bequests from individuals, and by regular support from the Friends of the Yehudi Menuhin School.

Yehudi Menuhin founded the school to provide an environment and tuition for musically gifted children from all over the world to pursue their love of music, develop their musical potential, and achieve standards of performance on stringed instruments and piano at the highest level. Today&#x27;s School provides a holistic musical and academic education for around 85 students aged from 9 to 19, with specialist tuition on the stringed instruments, piano and classical guitar. The majority of the school&#x27;s pupils are boarders, with roughly a dozen day pupils, mainly in the younger age groups.

It is the school&#x27;s ambition to be &#x27;needs-blind&#x27; in its admission process. Parents are charged fees in accordance with their ability to pay, with around three-quarters supported by the Music and Dance Scheme and the remainder assisted by bursaries from the school.

The school is a registered charity under English law.

The Menuhin Hall located in the school grounds hosts a full programme of concerts throughout the year.

==History==
The institutional legacy of Yehudi Menuhin (1916–99) includes the Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists, Live Music Now (specially active in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and France), the Menuhin Festival Gstaad, the Brussels-based International Menuhin Foundation and the Fundación Yehudi Menuhin España, but the Menuhin School has been described as &#x27;his most enduring contribution to musical life&#x27;. When awarded a life peerage in 1993, he chose the title Lord Menuhin of Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, and he is buried in the grounds of the school.

It was founded in 1963 in London, moving to its present premises a year later. The principal building (to which others were added) is a Victorian Neo-Gothic house in Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, easily accessible by road and train from London and set in fifteen acres of parkland.

Menuhin was partly inspired by the example of the Central School of Music in Moscow, but &quot;our school was not intended to be a copy. Moscow had three hundred students. I started with fifteen and by 1972 had thirty-eight. Apart from differences of scale, however, our priorities were different. Moscow was training soloists, we wanted to train musical all-rounders, fitted to moving on into teaching, chamber groups, orchestras or solo work...&quot; A landmark in the musical development of the school was, however, his recruitment to the teaching staff in 1992 of Natasha Boyarsky, who had been head of strings in the Tchaikovsky Conservatoire in Moscow.

Menuhin&#x27;s aim was to provide the school&#x27;s pupils with outstanding teachers, adequate time to practise, frequent opportunities to perform, ensemble work with other gifted children, and a broad musical and general-academic education, all within a nourishing family community where each individual can develop his or her full potential. After its first ten years it was awarded special status by the Government as a Centre of Excellence in the Performing Arts, thus eligible for support from the ministry of education. Menuhin had been home-schooled himself by his parents and tutors in San Francisco, but he believed that it was in the interest of musically gifted children to live and study with their peers.

After Menuhin&#x27;s death in 1999, the school undertook a fundraising drive to make possible the construction of a state-of-the-art concert hall, the Menuhin Hall, which was opened in 2006 with a concert conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, who had accepted the honorary position of president in succession to Menuhin. The Menuhin Hall hosts a full programme of Showcase Concerts, featuring School pupils, as well as concerts and master classes given by established musicians, and with its excellent acoustics it is much in demand by recording companies. After his death later in 2006, Rostropovich was succeeded as president by Daniel Barenboim. The current president of the school is Tasmin Little, who was appointed in December 2019.

The Friends of the Yehudi Menuhin School, founded by Lord Menuhin in 1971 together with some local supporters, have now grown to over 750 supporters from all over the world, offering financial assistance to the school and an encouraging presence at concerts given by the pupils.

The school embarked on a wide-ranging development programme in 2013–14 after its first fifty years, and to mark Menuhin&#x27;s centenary in 2016. This has continued since with the aim of increasing its endowment for bursaries and also upgrading its facilities.

In 2022, the school announced its 2022-27 strategic plan, entitled &quot;21st Century Musicians&quot;. This details the schools five values: pursuit of excellence, intellectual curiosity, integrity, community and kindness.

<text>Walter Thiel (3 March 1910, Breslau – 17 August 1943, Karlshagen, near Peenemünde) was a German rocket scientist. 

Thiel provided the decisive ideas for the A4 (V-2) rocket engine and his research enabled rockets to head towards space.

== Life ==

Walter Erich Oskar Thiel was born on 3 March 1910 in the Silesian city of Breslau, as second son of Oskar Thiel (civil servant at the German Post) and Elsa (Prinz) Thiel.
In 1929 he passed all his school graduation exams (&quot;Abitur&quot;) with the highest possible grade A. After graduation he studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule zu Breslau (now Wrocław University of Technology). Due to his excellent work he was exempt from study fees as of the third semester.

In summer semester of 1931 he passed the preliminary examination with excellence. In winter semester 1933 he passed all 7 diploma exams with the highest possible grade A and he became Dipl.-Ing. (chem.). In 1934 his thesis &quot;Über die Addition von Verbindungen mit stark polarer Kohlenstoff-Halogenbindung an ungesättigte Kohlen-Wasserstoffe&quot; received the highest possible honor (summa cum laude). He became Dr.-Ing. (chem.). His doctorate was confirmed on 8 November 1934 in Breslau (source: Walter Thiel&#x27;s doctorate).

Thiel&#x27;s Professor in Breslau recommended Thiel to the Research Institute of the German army ordnance office of under-secretary Prof. Karl Erich Schumann at the University of Berlin. Thiel&#x27;s previous findings had technological applicability and therefore he was able to continue his fundamental research in a leading position. Late 1934 or early 1935 Thiel became research instructor at Reichswehrministerium. Schumann accompanied many diploma theses and dissertations, including that of Wernher von Braun, who completed his dissertation in 1934. The contacts between the testing ground in Kummersdorf and Schumann&#x27;s Institute was close, the eastern part of the site in Kummersdorf served as an experimental base for Schumann&#x27;s institutes, in the west a group of scientists around Major Walter Dornberger carried out their experiments. Here Thiel got to know Walter Dornberger and Wernher von Braun.

In autumn of 1936 Dornberger asked Thiel to move from fundamental research to Wa Prüf 11 at Kummersdorf&#x27;s western testing ground. All topics regarding the engine were assigned to Thiel, and he had to further advance the propulsion, which he managed in a very short time. In his paper &quot;Empirische und theoretische Grundlagen zur Neuberechnung von Öfen und Versuchsdaten, Schießplatz Kummersdorf Vers. West&quot;, that he presented on 27 April 1937, Thiel introduces developments that lead to decisive changes, including a shortening of the oven and an optimization of the injection nozzle. Furthermore, Thiel continued to research different fuel mixtures for the rocket engines.

In 1937 the first scientists moved from Kummersdorf to Peenemünde. As the test stations were not ready yet, Thiel and his team stayed in Kummersdorf until 1940. After transferring from Kummersdorf to the Peenemünde Army Research Center in the summer of 1940, Thiel became deputy director of the Peenemünde HVP Organization under von Braun. In 1940 many new scientists were recruited to speed up the R&amp;D of the A4. Chemist Gerhard Heller became a very important co-worker of Thiel. They also established private contacts. Other colleagues of Thiel at the development unit included: Hermann M. Bedürftig, Konrad Dannenberg, Werner Dobrick, Hans Fichtner, Werner Gengelbach, Hans J. Lindenmayr, Dr. William Mrazek, Kurt E. Patt, Gerhard Reisig, Walther J. Riedel (Riedel III), Ludwig Roth, Helmut Zoike. After the war, these scientists and others were recruited into United States-government service as part of Operation Paperclip.

In the A4 project, the first successful launch occurred from test station VII on 3 October 1942. The rocket flew 190 km in the targeted direction and it reached a height of 85 km. The top-speed was 1,322 m/s. As the A4 was now showing military qualities, the NS leadership was demanding immediate implementation in war. Mass production replaced science, although the whole unit was still immature. There were many launch failures after 3 October 1942. In 1943 Thiel and many fellow scientists and researchers were very exhausted and unhappy in Peenemünde. Work overload, pressure to succeed and the changeover from a research unit to a production facility started to take its toll on the scientists. Thiel refused to declare the rocket engine ready for mass production. In a letter to von Braun, sent during a trip to a health farm, Thiel described the Aggregat 4: &quot;…where it is more of a complicated lab product than a mass item….&quot;. Thiel formulated his protest by handing in his resignation orally on 17 August 1943. He planned to get his professorship at a university. Dornberger rejected his resignation.

During the following night (17–18 August 1943) the Royal Air Force launched a bombing raid of Peenemünde, Operation &quot;Hydra&quot;. The Thiel family died in a slit trench in front of their home in Karlshagen. Thiel and his family (wife Martha, daughter Sigrid and son Siegfried) were buried at the war cemetery in Karlshagen. Martin Schilling replaced Thiel.

== Legacy ==
On 29 October 1944, Thiel was posthumously awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the War Merit Cross with Swords.

In 1970 a Moon crater is named after him. It is located on the far side of the Moon and thus not visible from Earth. (Coordinates: 40° 42’ N / 134° 30’ W, mean diameter: 32.0 km). He was one of the first pioneers to be inducted in the “International Space Hall of Fame” in Alamogordo, New Mexico, USA in 1976.

== Aggregate series Development ==

Based on the film cooling (&#x27;veil cooling&#x27;) solution identified by colleague Moritz Pöhlmann at Peenemünde, Thiel designed annular rings of tiny perforations to inject unburnt fuel through the chamber walls at the throat for evaporative cooling to prevent V-2 rocket nozzle erosion.

By 15 September 1941 Thiel officially declared the basic eighteen-pot design of the A-4 motor finished.

Earlier in the spring of 1941, Thiel began investigating nitric acid and diesel oil to be used as the fuel for the 30-ton-thrust A-8 .

Then, on 18 December 1941, Thiel documented the initial A-9/A-10 motor design of six combustion chambers into one common nozzle in Secret Command Document 1496/41.

By the middle of August 1943, Dr Thiel declared that the A-4 developmental problems preclude mass production, recommended the project be abandoned.

Thiel also designed the motor for the Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile.

<doc id="441174" wikidata="Q18461" url="?curid=441174" title="Butomus umbellatus">
<text>Butomus umbellatus is a Eurasian plant species in the family Butomaceae. It is the only species in the family. Common names include flowering rush or grass rush. Introduced into North America as an ornamental plant it has now become a serious invasive weed in the Great Lakes area and in parts of the Pacific Northwest. In Israel, one of its native countries, it is an endangered species due to the habitat loss. It can also be found in Great Britain locally, for example at the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels. The plant is a rhizomatous, hairless, perennial aquatic plant. Its name is derived from Greek &quot;bous&quot;, meaning &quot;cow&quot;, &quot;ox&quot; etc. and &quot;tome&quot;, a cut (the verb &#x27;temnein&#x27; meaning &quot;to cut&quot;), which refers to the plant&#x27;s swordlike leaves.

==Description==
In contrast to what its English name suggests, it is not a true rush. It is native to Old World continents and grows on the margins of still and slowly moving water down to a depth of about 3 m. It has pink flowers.

The plant has linear, pointed leaves up to 1 metre long, or more. The leaves are triangular in cross-section and arise in two rows along the rhizome/base. They are untoothed, parallel veined and twisted.

The inflorescence is umbel-like consisting of a single terminal flower surrounded by three cymes. The flowers are regular and bisexual, 2 to 3 cm across. There are three petal-like sepals which are pink with darker veins. They persist in the fruit. The three petals are like the sepals but somewhat larger. 6–9 stamens. Carpels superior, 6–9 and slightly united at the base. When ripe they are obovoid and crowned with a persistent style. Ovules are numerous and found scattered over the inner surface of the carpel wall, except on the midrib and edges. Fruit is a follicle. The seeds have no endosperm, and a straight embryo. It flowers from July until August.

== Spread ==
&quot;Butomus umbellatus&quot; is native to Eurasia and was first found in Canada in the late 1800s and in the United States in the early 1900s. The first discovery in North America was in the St. Lawrence River in 1897. The species was unintentionally introduced into the United States’ Great Lakes through the discharge of contaminated cargo ship ballast water.

This plant spreads mostly from its rhizomes and occurs in wet areas with muddy soil, such as freshwater marshlands, lakes and streams. &quot;Butomus umbellatus&quot; will out compete native vegetation. It can also create dense root structures that become hazards for boat traffic. It is tolerant of a wide range of temperatures which gave it the potential to invade across much of the United States.

&quot;Butomus umbellatus&quot; is listed as a prohibited species in Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois, and as a restricted species (but still available) in Wisconsin
== Uses ==
&quot;Butomus umbellatus&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental waterside plant.

In parts of Russia the rhizomes are used as food.

<doc id="441175" wikidata="Q3531723" url="?curid=441175" title="Tony Clement">
<text>Tony Peter Clement (&quot;né&quot; Payani; born January 27, 1961) is a Canadian former politician in the federal and Ontario governments. He was Member of Parliament for Parry Sound-Muskoka and a federal cabinet minister in the Conservative Party under prime minister Stephen Harper. Before entering federal politics, Clement served as an Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament for Brampton South then Brampton West—Mississauga and a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, including as Minister of Health and Long-Term Care under premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

He was a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada after its formation from the merger of the Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parties in 2003. He lost to Stephen Harper. Clement won the seat of Parry Sound-Muskoka in the 2006 federal election, defeating incumbent Liberal cabinet minister Andy Mitchell. The Conservatives formed government in that election and Clement was appointed Minister of Health and Minister for FedNor. He also later served as President of the Treasury Board. Clement was re-elected despite the Conservative defeat in the 2015 election. On July 12, 2016, he announced his second bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party but withdrew on October 13, 2016.

From his initial election in 2006, Clement sat as a Conservative member until he resigned at the request of Conservative leader Andrew Scheer on November 7, 2018, due to a sexting scandal.

==Early life and career==

Clement was born Tony Peter Panayi in Manchester, England, the son of Carol Ann (&quot;née&quot; Drapkin) and Peter Panayi. His father was a Greek Cypriot and his mother was Jewish (part of her family had immigrated from Aleppo, Syria). He emigrated to Canada in childhood with his parents when he was four years old. His parents divorced and his mother married Ontario politician John Clement, with Tony adopting his stepfather&#x27;s surname soon after.

As a student at the University of Toronto, Clement was elected twice, both as an undergraduate and as a law student, to the university&#x27;s Governing Council. He was also president of the campus Progressive Conservatives. He first attracted the attention of the media in 1986, when he created a new society to invite the South African ambassador to Canada, Glenn Babb, to speak after the International Law Society had withdrawn its invitation, deeming it too controversial because of the issue of apartheid. Clement argued in favour of inviting Babb on the grounds of free speech. An attempt by four law professors for a court injunction barring &quot;any representative of the Republic of South Africa to expound, explain or otherwise to solicit public support for his Government&#x27;s policy of apartheid&quot; was rejected by the court.

A graduate of the University of Toronto, Clement completed degrees in political science in 1983 and law in 1986. He was called to the Ontario Bar in 1988.

Clement is married to Lynne Golding, a partner and Chair of the Health Law Practice at the international law firm, Fasken Martineau DuMoulin.

Clement became president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in 1990 and was a close ally of then-party leader Mike Harris. He ran, unsuccessfully, for Metro Toronto Council in 1994, losing to future mayor David Miller in the ward of Parkdale-High Park. He served as Harris&#x27;s assistant principal secretary from 1992 to 1995 and played a leading role in drafting policy directives for the Common Sense Revolution.

In November 2019, Clement started the &quot;And Another Thing&quot; podcast with Jodie Jenkins which features a weekly interview with a public figure, and the discussion between Clement and Jenkins.

==In provincial politics==
Clement was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent Liberal Bob Callahan by over 6,000 votes in the riding of Brampton South. After serving as a Parliamentary Assistant for two years, he was appointed Minister of Transportation on October 10, 1997. He also represented the Progressive Conservative government on a variety of televised discussion panels, gaining the reputation of a rising star in the party.

Clement was returned in the provincial election of 1999 in the new riding of Brampton West—Mississauga, defeating Liberal candidate Vic Dhillon by over 8,000 votes. He was promoted to Minister of the Environment on June 17, 1999, and served in this capacity until May 3, 2000. In this role, he implemented the program known as Ontario&#x27;s Drive Clean, which mandated periodic emissions tests on vehicles in southern Ontario.

Clement was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing on October 25, 1999, and held this position until February 8, 2001.

On February 8, 2001, Clement was appointed Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. He initiated primary care reform, oversaw the implementation of Telehealth Ontario (a toll-free health information line staffed by registered nurses) and expanded Ontario&#x27;s hospitals system. Clement also entered into a public-private partnership for a hospital redevelopment in Brampton.

Clement ran for leadership in the 2002 Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership election and finished third on the first ballot. Clement then placed his support behind victorious candidate Ernie Eves on the second ballot. When Eves became Premier, he kept Clement in the Health portfolio.

Clement was especially prominent when Toronto suffered an outbreak of SARS in the summer of 2003, travelling to Geneva in a successful bid to urge the World Health Organization to lift a travel ban to Canada&#x27;s largest city.

The Eves government was defeated in the 2003 provincial election, and Clement was defeated by Vic Dhillon by about 2,500 votes in a rematch of 1999. Clement afterwards worked as a counsel for Bennett Jones LLP. He also was a small business owner and a visiting professor at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law.

==Federal politics==
Clement first became prominent in federal politics in 2000, sitting on the steering committee for the United Alternative. This initiative was meant to provide a framework for the Reform Party and Progressive Conservative Party to unite under a single banner. It did not accomplish this end, but nonetheless led to the formation of the Canadian Alliance later that year; Clement served as the Alliance&#x27;s founding president.

Soon after the 2003 provincial election, Clement declared himself a candidate for the leadership of the new Conservative Party of Canada. He placed third in the party&#x27;s leadership vote, while Stephen Harper emerged as the winner.

He then sought election as the Conservative Party candidate in Brampton West in the 2004 federal election, but lost to Liberal incumbent Colleen Beaumier by about 3,500 votes.

For his second attempt to win a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, in the 2006 campaign, he switched to the Parry Sound-Muskoka riding. On election night, he was declared winner by 21 votes. Upon conclusion of the judicial recount, Clement was found to have defeated Mitchell by 28 votes: 18,513-18,485. On February 6, 2006, Clement was appointed as Minister of Health by Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Clement pledged to extend an existing measure to require disclosure of meetings by only registered lobbyists with lower-level government officials who have decision-making power.

===Minister of Health===
Some of Clement&#x27;s initiatives included announcing a national strategy on autism, working towards establishing Canada&#x27;s first Patient Wait Times Guarantees, and investing in faster, more effective and safer health information systems across Canada for Canadians.

One of Clement&#x27;s first initiatives as Minister of Health was establishing the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, an independent not-for-profit organization committed to combating this disease and improve patient quality of life.

In 2006, Clement launched the Public Health Scholarship and Capacity Building Initiative — on-going scholarships supporting public health training and positions across Canada. Furthermore, in 2006, he announced the $1-billion compensation package for pre-1986/post-1990 forgotten victims of the tainted blood scandal, who were neglected in the 1998 settlement agreement.

Clement also played a key role in launching the Chemical Management Plan, which the Conservative government claimed &quot;made Canada a world leader in chemical management&quot;. &quot;We have established clear priorities and now we are taking action to protect the health of Canadians,&quot; said Clement. Further, the government claimed &quot;Canada was the first nation in the world to take action to prohibit the importation, sale and advertising of baby bottles that contain BPA&quot;.

On September 29, 2007, the CBC reported Clement&#x27;s new strategy to combat the growing drug abuse problem in Canada. &quot;The party is over&quot; for illicit drug users, he announced, with the new policy aiming towards widespread arrest of drug users, in contrast to the old strategy of targeting dealers. Over 130 physicians and scientists signed a petition condemning the Conservative government&#x27;s &quot;potentially deadly&quot; misrepresentation of the positive evidence for harm reduction programs. Clement stated that governments in Canada have been sending the wrong message about drug use, and he wanted to clear up the mixed messages going out on illicit drugs.

Also in 2007, Clement launched the new Canada&#x27;s Food Guide, the first update in 15 years incorporating the most up-to-date information based on current nutritional science and a new interactive web section.

===Minister of Industry===

On October 30, 2008, Clement was sworn into the office of Industry Minister. This included the appointment to the Office of the Registrar General of Canada.

Shortly after becoming Industry Minister, Clement launched the Knowledge Infrastructure Program, a two-year $2-billion measure that supported infrastructure enhancement at post-secondary institutions across Canada.

In conjunction with the US and Ontario governments, Clement worked closely on the restructuring of GM and Chrysler. Following the successful restructuring, he stated that the companies &quot;will now be in a position to operate a sustainable and viable business that Lost 86% production, innovation and jobs in Canada.&quot; Furthermore, he said, &quot;This is news for 32,000 Canadian auto workers, the Canadian auto parts supply chain and for Canadian consumers. Moving forward, the Government of Canada will continue to work toward removing our country&#x27;s auto industry, while exercising rigorous oversight of taxpayer money.&quot;

In the summer of 2010, Clement introduced changes to the 2011 Census. On this issue, he said, &quot;The government will retain the mandatory short form that will collect basic demographic information. To meet the need for additional information, and to respect the privacy wishes of Canadians, the government has introduced the voluntary National Household Survey (NHS).&quot; The change sparked significant criticism, including the resignation of Statistics Canada&#x27;s Chief Statistician (see Voluntary long-form survey controversy). Other changes included the addition of questions about the languages spoken by Canadians.

On November 14, 2010, Australia&#x27;s BHP Billiton withdrew its hostile $39-billion offer for Saskatchewan&#x27;s Potash Corporation. At a news conference following the withdrawal, Clement explained that of the six Investment Canada Act guidelines that determine if an investment has a &quot;net benefit&quot;, he said BHP&#x27;s bid failed to meet three of them. Clement said the Government felt the takeover would not have a beneficial effect on Canada&#x27;s competitiveness in world markets.

In January 2011, Clement spoke out against a ruling of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) which allowed usage-based billing for wholesale clients and smaller internet service providers. Citing concerns about how the change could adversely affect consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs, he warned that if they did not revise the decision, the government would intervene. The CRTC initiated its own review of the ruling, and reversed its decision.

In the lead-up to the 2010 G8 summit, Clement was involved in directing $50 million of border security money for largely unrelated projects in his own riding, a practice commonly known as &quot;pork barrelling&quot;. Auditor-General Sheila Fraser issued a report criticizing the Minister for breaking the rules and &quot;complained that there was no paperwork to determine how the hundreds of proposals&quot; for spending were narrowed to the 32 projects that were approved. Clement later admitted that this process was not subject to the oversight that it should have been.

===President of the Treasury Board===

Shortly after the May 2, 2011 election, Clement was appointed as the President of the Treasury Board, a position of wide-ranging authority and oversight. Consistent with the Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s election platform, Clement has been tasked with leading a government-wide spending review, with the goal of finding ways to contain government spending.

On November 2, 2013, Clement backed a motion at the Conservative Party national convention that advocated clawing back public-sector pay and benefits. At the convention he vowed, as the minister responsible for negotiations with the civil service, to &quot;alter the dynamics of collective bargaining as it has been done in this country over the last few decades&quot;.

On December 22, 2014, Clement was quoted by the Canadian Press as saying that government deliberately withholds public data because people using the information might &quot;create havoc&quot; by altering the contents.

===Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario===
On February 6, 2006, in addition to being appointed Minister of Health, Clement was also appointed Minister responsible for FedNor (Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario). Clement held the FedNor portfolio until July 2013. FedNor invests in projects that support community economic development, business growth and competitiveness, and innovation; FedNor&#x27;s goal is to encourage economic growth, diversification, job creation and self-reliant communities in northern Ontario.

Between February 2006 and January 2012, FedNor approved $398 million in support of 1,742 projects, which leveraged an additional $614 million from other sources. During this same period, FedNor also approved $11 million towards 364 youth internships, with close to two-thirds of these interns finding employment following their internship. Of the total funding from February 2006 to January 2012, $44 million went toward 300 tourism-related projects, which included over 70 youth internships.

FedNor projects include some of the following:

Red Lake - Unorganized Kenora District - To build on existing efforts to extend Union Gas&#x27; natural gas pipeline to the Goldcorp mines, businesses, and residences of the Red Lake community. $2.7 million

Dryden - The Corporation of The City of Dryden - To expand Dryden&#x27;s industrial park and the Norwill subdivision (acquisition and clearing of land, construction of an access road, and expansion of municipal services). $1,470,000

Eagle Lake - Eagle Lake First Nation - To prepare the First Nation for the development of one of two proposed wood processing plants for the Two Feathers Forest Products Initiative. Project cancelled on January 27, 2011,

Parry Sound - The Corporation of the Town of Parry Sound - To expand municipal services to accommodate the announced $6.2-million construction of an expanded Parry Sound Canadore College campus. $1,290,000

FedNor has provided funding to encourage tourism in northern Ontario by:
*Increasing the awareness of this region as a tourism destination;
*Encouraging product development and investments in northern Ontario&#x27;s tourism assets and products by supporting new and expanding festivals and events, and developing niche tourism products (e.g., authentic Aboriginal, francophone, motorcycling touring routes);
*Fostering an adequate supply of skills and labour to enhance visitor experiences.

===Opposition===
Clement retained his seat in the 2015 general election that defeated the Conservative government. Moving to the Opposition benches, he was appointed the Opposition&#x27;s critic for foreign affairs by interim Leader of the Opposition Rona Ambrose. He stepped down from the Shadow Cabinet on July 12, 2016, in order to launch his campaign for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He ended his campaign on October 12, 2016, due to not meeting fundraising goals he had set for his campaign.

====Sexting scandal====
In early November 2018, Clement resigned his House of Commons committee assignments and his role as Conservative Shadow Minister for Justice. The resignation was filed after he admitted having shared &quot;sexually explicit images and a video of [himself]&quot; with an individual or party that he &quot;believed was a consenting female recipient&quot; but was actually a person that Clement claimed had targeted him for extortion. The RCMP were investigating the situation. After additional allegations of improper behaviour were made against Clement on November 7, party leader Andrew Scheer requested that he also resign from the Conservative caucus. Clement did so and continued to sit as an independent MP. In January 2019, two men from the Ivory Coast were arrested in connection with the attempted extortion of Clement. On April 2, Clement announced that he would not be standing as a candidate in the next federal election.

==Political positions==

Clement has stated that there are circumstances where the death penalty is warranted.

Clement, as Conservative Public Safety Critic, stated in February 2017 that the RCMP needed to &quot;enforce the law&quot; to stop the influx of Syrian Refugees attempting to cross the Canada–United States border in the wake of US President Donald Trump&#x27;s Executive Order 13769 to ban citizens of certain majority Muslim countries from entering the United States. When a CBC Radio reporter asked Clement in a telephone interview to specify the measures the RCMP must take to do so, he refused to answer and hung up. Clement stated in an interview with &quot;Power Play&quot; on CTV News Channel that the Conservatives &quot;are calling for two things in particular. One, more resources, more money and funding, and human resources for the border agents and for the RCMP to deal with this much higher influx... Secondly, we want the federal government to develop a plan. What is the plan that is going to be employed or deployed to ensure that the rule of law continues in this country, that the laws are obeyed, that we don&#x27;t have illegal crossings?&quot;

Clement favored reforming Canada&#x27;s taxation system. When running for the Conservative Party leadership he collaborated with Roger Martin on a proposal for a lifetime income tax.

<doc id="441179" wikidata="Q909434" url="?curid=441179" title="Combustion chamber">
<text>A combustion chamber is part of an internal combustion engine in which the fuel/air mix is burned. For steam engines, the term has also been used for an extension of the firebox which is used to allow a more complete combustion process.

== Internal combustion engines ==
In an internal combustion engine, the pressure caused by the burning air/fuel mixture applies direct force to part of the engine (e.g. for a piston engine, the force is applied to the top of the piston), which converts the gas pressure into mechanical energy (often in the form of a rotating output shaft). This contrasts an external combustion engine, where the combustion takes place in a separate part of the engine to where the gas pressure is converted into mechanical energy. 

=== Spark-ignition engines ===
In spark ignition engines, such as petrol (gasoline) engines, the combustion chamber is usually located in the cylinder head. The engines are often designed such that the bottom of combustion chamber is roughly in line with the top of the engine block.

Modern engines with overhead valves or overhead camshaft(s) use the top of the piston (when it is near top dead centre) as the bottom of the combustion chamber. Above this, the sides and roof of the combustion chamber include the intake valves, exhaust valves and spark plug. This forms a relatively compact combustion chamber without any protrusions to the side (i.e. all of the chamber is located directly above the piston). Common shapes for the combustion chamber are typically similar to one or more half-spheres (such as the hemi, pent-roof, wedge or kidney-shaped chambers).

The older flathead engine design uses a &quot;bathtub&quot;-shaped combustion chamber, with an elongated shape that sits above both the piston and the valves (which are located beside the piston). IOE engines combine elements of overhead valve and flathead engines; the intake valve is located above the combustion chamber, while the exhaust valve is located below it.

The shape of the combustion chamber, intake ports and exhaust ports are key to achieving efficient combustion and maximising power output. Cylinder heads are often designed to achieve a certain &quot;swirl&quot; pattern (rotational component to the gas flow) and turbulence, which improves the mixing and increases the flow rate of gasses. The shape of the piston top also affects the amount of swirl.

Another design feature to promote turbulence for good fuel/air mixing is squish, where the fuel/air mix is &quot;squished&quot; at high pressure by the rising piston.

The location of the spark plug is also an important factor, since this is the starting point of the &quot;flame front&quot; (the leading edge of the burning gasses) which then travels downwards towards the piston. Good design should avoid narrow crevices where stagnant &quot;end gas&quot; can become trapped, reducing the power output of the engine and potentially leading to engine knocking. Most engines use a single spark plug per cylinder, however some (such as the 1986-2009 Alfa Romeo Twin Spark engine) use two spark plugs per cylinder.

=== Compression-ignition engines ===
Compression-ignition engines, such as diesel engines, are typically classified as either:

* Direct injection, where the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber. Common varieties include unit direct injection and common rail injection.
* Indirect injection, where the fuel is injected into a swirl chamber or pre-combustion chamber. The fuel ignites as it is injected into this chamber and the burning air/fuel mixture spreads into the main combustion chamber.

Direct injection engines usually give better fuel economy but indirect injection engines can use a lower grade of fuel.

Harry Ricardo was prominent in developing combustion chambers for diesel engines, the best known being the &quot;Ricardo Comet&quot;.

===Gas turbine===

In a continuous flow system, for example a jet engine combustor, the pressure is controlled and the combustion creates an increase in volume. The combustion chamber in gas turbines and jet engines (including ramjets and scramjets) is called the combustor.

The combustor is fed with high pressure air by the compression system, adds fuel and burns the mix and feeds the hot, high pressure exhaust into the turbine components of the engine or out the exhaust nozzle.

Different types of combustors exist, mainly:
* Can type: Can combustors are self-contained cylindrical combustion chambers. Each &quot;can&quot; has its own fuel injector, liner, interconnectors, casing. Each &quot;can&quot; get an air source from individual opening.
* Cannular type: Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the combustion zones share a common air casing.
* Annular type: Annular combustors do away with the separate combustion zones and simply have a continuous liner and casing in a ring (the annulus).

===Rocket engine===
If the gas velocity changes, thrust is produced, such as in the nozzle of a rocket engine.

== Steam engines ==

Considering the definition of combustion chamber used for internal combustion engines, the equivalent part of a steam engine would be the firebox, since this is where the fuel is burned. However, in the context of a steam engine, the term &quot;combustion chamber&quot; has also been used for a specific area between the firebox and the boiler. This extension of the firebox is designed to allow a more complete combustion of the fuel, improving fuel efficiency and reducing build-up of soot and scale. The use of this type of combustion chamber is large steam locomotive engines, allows the use of shorter firetubes.

==Micro combustion chambers==
Micro combustion chambers are the devices in which combustion happens at a very small volume, due to which surface to volume ratio increases which plays a vital role in stabilizing the flame.

<doc id="441187" wikidata="Q804926" url="?curid=441187" title="Balfron Tower">
<text>Balfron Tower is a 26-storey residential building in Poplar, located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, London. Built in a Brutalist style, it forms part of the Brownfield Estate, an area of social housing between Chrisp Street Market and the A12 northern approach to the Blackwall Tunnel. It was designed by Ernő Goldfinger in 1963 for the London County Council, built 1965–67 by the GLC, and has been a listed building since 1996 (Grade II*, originally Grade II). Balfron Tower is stylistically similar to Goldfinger&#x27;s later Trellick Tower in North Kensington, within West London.

==Design==
Balfron Tower is high and contains 146 homes (136 flats and 10 maisonettes). Lifts serve every third floor; thus, to reach a flat on the 11th, 12th, or 13th floors, residents or visitors would take a lift to the 12th. The lift shaft sits in a separate service tower, also containing laundry rooms and rubbish chutes, and joined to the residential tower by eight walkways.

The maisonettes are on floors 1 and 2, and 15 and 16, causing a break in the pattern of fenestration on the west side.

The service tower is topped by a boiler room. In 1985, the original concrete boiler flues were replaced with metal, due to concrete decay.
==Carradale House==
Carradale House (1967–70) is an adjacent, unique, modernist building, also designed by Ernő Goldfinger and Grade II listed. The two buildings appear to be natural extensions of each other, linked by style and design, with the long, low form of Carradale House complementing the height of Balfron Tower. All flats have dual window aspect and large south facing balconies, allowing plenty of natural light, and decorated with natural wood panels on the sides. The block is tall with 11 floors, and contains 88 flats. The building has a similar podium to Balfron Tower, albeit more extensive with a large underground car park underneath. It too has sky bridges on the same principle of access at every third floor. After designing Balfron, Goldfinger identified all the possible improvements and incorporated them first in Carradale House and afterwards to Trellick Tower. Like Balfron Tower, the robust nature of the detailing to this building has helped it to weather the passage of time. Over the course of three years, Carradale underwent an extensive and careful renovation under the supervision of English Heritage and the direction of PRP Architects.

The two blocks were known as Rowlett Street Phases I and II during development before being named after the Scottish villages of Balfron and Carradale, a pattern followed in naming other locations on the nearby Aberfeldy and Teviot estates.

===Brownfield Estate===
Owen Hatherley describes the surrounding Brownfield Estate as &quot;all designed with an attention to detail and quality of materials unusual for the 60s or any other decade&quot;.

==History==

Balfron Tower was designed by architect Ernő Goldfinger and is associated with the Brutalist style of 1960s architecture. Goldfinger himself was pleased with the design and moved into flat 130, on the 25th floor, for two months in 1968. He and his wife threw champagne parties to find out what the residents liked and disliked about his design. He applied what he learnt to his design for the similar and more famous Trellick Tower in West London. Goldfinger&#x27;s studio later added Glenkerry House on the same estate, complementing Balfron Tower and Carradale in style.

The building was given Grade II listed status in March 1996, (later changed to Grade II*) followed by Carradale House in 2000. to spare them from demolition. Carradale and Glenkerry Houses were also included in the Balfron Tower Conservation Area, designated in 1998. The listing continues to attract comment, especially in view of the failure of another nearby Brutalist estate, Robin Hood Gardens, to obtain the same protection. 
In recent years Balfron Tower has been popular with visitors during the annual Open House Weekend.

In December 2007, following a ballot of residents in 2006, Tower Hamlets Council transferred its ownership of Balfron Tower, Carradale House and the surrounding Brownfield Estate to Poplar HARCA, a housing association.

==Refurbishment and sell-off==

HARCA began a full refurbishment of the buildings in 2011. The architectural firm PRP which took up this project looked to restore these Brutalist structures to their original form as required by English Heritage, and also to bring the buildings up to modern specifications and 21st century living standards. 
The refurbishment was technically challenging, due to the need to install new services without disturbing the listed exterior. The solid concrete design also suffers inherently from cold bridging, which had to be remedied by internal wall insulation.

Residents were to have the option to keep their flats in the blocks, or to move into new low-rise homes nearby, in which case the vacated flats would be sold to finance the works. In October 2010, the residents of both blocks were sent notice that the refurbishment would require all residents to move out, due to fire safety and other risks, with no undertaking on whether they could return.

The first phase of the refurbishment took place from 2011 to 2014 with the lower block, Carradale House. Key features of the refurbishment include: replacement of existing windows with high-performance examples matching original pattern; upgrade of thermal performance using materials to provide insulation and vapour barriers; efficient gas-fired boilers for replacement communal heating system; and new wet services, incorporating water conservation measures. Internally, communal spaces and flats are sensitively refurbished in keeping and without altering Goldfinger&#x27;s original layouts and heritage features. 
These embody key considerations related to restoring the key elements of the original scheme, undertaking repair and replacement on like-for-like basis, ensuring a lifespan of at least 30 years, taking advantage of a once in a lifetime opportunity to scaffold the entire building and upgrading as far as possible to accord with modern standards. This will ensure its future effectiveness and desirability as a place to live.

Work to refurbish Balfron Tower was undertaken through a joint partnership with Londonewcastle, a luxury residential developer.
Pending the works to Balfron Tower, some flats were temporarily occupied by artists, who contributed to the community and put on displays in &quot;heritage flat&quot; number 123. A major photographic project was undertaken in November 2010.

In September 2014, Wayne Hemingway restored Goldfinger&#x27;s former flat number 130 to 1960s style as part of a National Trust exhibition on brutalism.

As residents were decanted, a campaign formed in December 2014 in an attempt to save 50% of the Balfron as social housing. In February 2015, residents and campaigners protested HARCA in February 2015 over fears that social tenants would be evicted. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that no social housing would be retained, and that all of the flats would be sold. Six &quot;heritage&quot; apartments have been retained with original layout and colour scheme, with fixtures matching the originals.

The second phase refurbishment plans were strongly opposed by the Twentieth Century Society in 2015. In particular they claim that the &#x27;unsympathetic&#x27; replacement of the tower&#x27;s windows has compromised the distinction and importance of the tower, reducing it from a &#x27;genuinely iconic brutalist masterpiece&#x27; to an &#x27;ersatz hybrid&#x27;.

Rowland Atkinson from the University of Sheffield said: &quot;The decision to convert two of the most symbolic tower blocks in London from local authority to private residences is a sign of how much the city has been set in service to the needs of capital and the rich.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Shots of the building are featured in music videos for &quot;This Is Music&quot; by The Verve, &quot;Morning Glory&quot; by Oasis, &quot;Mortalhas&quot; by ProfJam, &quot;Ready to Go&quot; by Republica, and “Money Talks” by Rubella Ballet.

Balfron Tower has appeared as a location in many British television programmes, often when an impression of urban deprivation was required. Some that used it extensively are &quot;Faking It&quot;, the second episode of the BBC series &quot;Hustle&quot;; the ITV series &quot;The Fixer&quot;; and &quot;Whitechapel&quot;, a three-part drama series produced by Carnival Films.

The tower is featured in the 1988 film &quot;For Queen and Country&quot;, starring Denzel Washington and was the filming location for &quot;Shopping&quot;, a 1994 film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. It also features in Danny Boyle&#x27;s post-apocalyptic horror film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and the 2011 film &quot;Blitz&quot;.

William Raban shot About Now MMX (2010) during his artist&#x27;s residency in Balfron Tower. In July 2014 artist Catherine Yass was refused permission to drop a piano from the Tower as part of a &quot;community workshop to explore how sound travels&quot;.

In 2014, the National Trust refurbished flat 130, where Goldfinger lived, to resemble its appearance in the 1960s. The work was designed by Tilly Hemmingway, with objects donated by the Land of Lost Content, a popular culture museum in Shropshire.

UK grime artist Wiley used Balfron Tower and the Brownfield Estate as the location for the music video of his track &quot;P Money&quot; in 2015, which was then later featured in his 2017 album &quot;Godfather&quot;.

The tower is referenced in the song &quot;Balfron&quot; by the band John on their album &quot;God Speed in the National Limit&quot;.

==Transport==

===Buses===
The estate is served by London Buses routes 108 and 309. London Buses routes 15, 115 and D8 run nearby.

===Canals===
The estate is adjacent to the junction of the Limehouse Cut canal and the River Lea Navigation at Bow Locks.

===Docklands Light Railway===
The nearest stations are Langdon Park and All Saints for Docklands Light Railway services towards Canary Wharf and Stratford.

===London Underground Station===

The nearest London Underground stations are Bromley-by-Bow tube station and Bow Road tube station on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, and in Travelcard Zones 4 and 3 respectively.

<text>Trellick Tower is a Grade II* listed tower block on the Cheltenham Estate in Kensal Town, London. Opened in 1972, it was commissioned by the Greater London Council and designed in the Brutalist style by architect Ernő Goldfinger. The tower was planned to replace outdated social accommodation, and designed as an improvement on Goldfinger&#x27;s earlier Balfron Tower in Poplar, East London. It was the last major project he worked on, and featured various space-saving designs, along with a separate access tower containing a plant room.

High-rise apartments and Brutalist architecture were falling out of favour by the time the tower was completed, and it became a magnet for crime, vandalism, drug abuse and prostitution. Conditions gradually improved in the 1980s after the establishment of a residents&#x27; association. Security measures were put in place and a concierge was employed, which led to lower crime levels. By the 1990s, the tower had become a desirable place to live, and although it still contains predominantly social housing, demand for private flats has remained high. A local landmark, it has been Grade II* listed since 1998, and has retained its distinctive concrete facade as a result. A fire broke out in 2017, but the concrete structure meant damage was limited, unlike the nearby Grenfell Tower. Trellick Tower has featured in film and television several times.

== Location ==
Trellick Tower is on the Cheltenham Estate in Golborne Road, Kensal Town, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC). It is bounded to the north and east by Meanwhile Gardens and the Grand Union Canal, and to the south by the A40 Westway and the Great Western Main Line leading from London Paddington station.

The nearest stations are Kensal Green (Bakerloo line and London Overground), Ladbroke Grove and Westbourne Park (Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines). The tower is served by London Buses route 23.

== Design ==

The tower is tall ( including the communications mast) and is a Grade II* listed building. The design is based on Goldfinger&#x27;s earlier and slightly smaller Balfron Tower in Poplar, East London. It has a long, thin profile, with a separate lift and service tower linked at every third storey to the access corridors in the main building, which overall has 31 floors. Flats above and below the corridor levels have internal stairs, while the 23rd and 24th floors are taken up by maisonettes split over the two floors. Overall, the building contains 217 dwellings and was originally owned by the GLC with the flats rented as council flats. All the apartments have balconies. The other building, containing shops and amenities, has seven floors.

The service tower has two additional floors higher than the main building, which includes a projecting plant room that holds the main heating system. It is fully linked by stairs in addition to the lifts, and also has a refuse chute mechanism. The majority of the plant and the hot water storage tank is located in the plant room, which reduces the need for pumps and reduces the amount of pipework needed. Shorter pipe runs also reduce heat loss. The oil-fired boilers originally used became obsolete due to the 1973 oil crisis, the year after the tower opened. The flats now have electric heaters and the plant room, although disused, still houses most of the now defunct mechanism.

Goldfinger designed the entire tower block freehand on butcher&#x27;s paper. He planned various communal areas, and purposely put slight variations in the structure so that each apartment would look different. He included a number of space-saving designs, such as using sliding doors to access bathrooms, and light switches embedded in the door surrounds. All apartments have large windows facing the balconies, in order to let in as much natural light as possible. As well as residential accommodation, there are a variety of shops, an office, and a youth centre. Throughout, quality materials were used in construction, including better fixtures and finishing the balconies with cedarwood. It was intended to be a good example of social accommodation alongside modern design.

== History ==
=== Planning ===

Construction of Trellick Tower began in 1968, in order to replace sub-standard local Victorian housing. The tower was one of several such buildings, and was initially welcomed as a way of resolving the crises of post-Second World War housing. Goldfinger said &quot;the whole object of building high is to free the ground for children and grown-ups to enjoy Mother Earth and not to cover every inch with bricks and mortar&quot;.

Goldfinger had been encouraged to construct Trellick Tower by the London County Council (LCC) following the success of Balfron Tower, which had been commissioned in 1963 and opened four years later. He took his inspiration from Balfron, where he had moved into one of the apartments in order to experience what life would be like for the tenants, and invited residents round for regular cocktail parties to tell him their likes and dislikes. This feedback was incorporated into the design of Trellick Tower. Many immigrants from the West Indies and the Caribbean settled in Trellick Tower, as for them it was one of the few affordable places to live in London. The tower opened on 28 June 1972; construction costs ran to £2.4 million. It was the last major project Goldfinger worked on; his reputation suffered as concrete tower blocks became unfashionable, and he died in 1987 before it could be restored.

=== Decline ===
By the time Trellick Tower opened, high-rise tower blocks were becoming unfashionable. The LCC had been replaced by the Greater London Council (GLC) by the time construction started, who put more stringent construction and financial constraints on the project. Shortly after its completion the building was transferred to the RBKC local council. Goldfinger had intended that tenants should be vetted for suitability and petitioned the GLC for the building to have proper security and a concierge, but the council declined his request. This meant that the building was open access and rough sleepers and drug criminals took up residence in its corridors. Drying rooms on the ground floor, designed by Goldfinger to stop tenants hanging laundry on the balconies, were vandalised before the tower block opened.

By the late 1970s Trellick Tower was a scene of crime and anti-social behaviour, and many tenants were very reluctant to move in. On one occasion vandals set off a fire extinguisher on the 12th floor, with water from the sprinkler system flooding the lifts and leaving the tower without electricity, heat or running water over the Christmas period. A pensioner was forced to use the stairs after all the lifts were out of order, and subsequently collapsed and died. On the 15th floor, a 27-year-old woman was dragged from one of the lifts and raped. The tower became nicknamed &quot;The Tower of Terror&quot; and residents attempted to be re-housed. The GLC spent more than £300,000 on an intercom system and wholesale electrical repairs, but reliability and management problems made them counterproductive.

In 1982 a man was killed after jumping off the top of Trellick Tower when his parachute failed to open. He was a member of a group of dangerous sports enthusiasts who were interested in BASE jumping. The action was condemned by the British Parachute Association.

=== Revival ===

With the introduction of the &quot;right to buy&quot; council homes, several of the flats were bought by their tenants. On 8 October 1984 a new residents&#x27; association was formed. As a result of pressure from the occupants, several security improvements including a door entry intercom system were installed, and a concierge was hired in 1987. In 1994 residents in the tower, along with other residents in Kensington &amp; Chelsea council properties, elected to self-manage the properties, in order to avoid increased rents and the threat of eviction.

Four low-power television relay transmitters with aerials were added to the communications equipment on top of the lift tower in December 1989, to solve reception problems for some residents of adjacent districts, including Notting Hill and Westbourne Grove. The transmitter installation is referred to by the BBC and Ofcom as &quot;Kensal Town&quot;.

In 1991, Sand Helsel, Professor of Architecture at RMIT, made a BBC documentary praising Trellick Tower, which helped to change public opinion in its favour. The tower subsequently became more respectable owing to its location close to Notting Hill and the gentrification of the neighbouring Golborne Road. Property prices rose and flats in the tower came to be regarded as highly desirable residences; requests to sell flats began to be posted on the tower&#x27;s communal noticeboard. By 1999 a flat in the tower could sell for £150,000 (£ as of ). In 2013 a three-bedroom end apartment (with views on three sides) was let for £2,600 pcm. The tower itself is a local landmark and was awarded a Grade II* listing in 1998, which included the main building and the adjacent row of shops and amenities. Also included is a doctor&#x27;s surgery with the original shop front and layout. Most of the flats are still social housing, but a significant minority are now privately owned.

On 19 April 2017 the top floors of the tower caught fire, believed to have been started by a discarded cigarette. There were no injuries. The building&#x27;s listed status meant that the concrete facade could not be covered over, which is thought to have prevented a far worse fire similar to Grenfell Tower which happened a few months later.

=== Redevelopment plans ===
As of 2021, there are plans to demolish neighbouring buildings and to extensively alter the tower&#x27;s immediate surroundings, including by adding a sixteen-storey block at an immediate right angle to the tower. The charity Open City described the plans as &quot;the latest in an ongoing programme of incremental demolition of Goldfinger’s world renowned social housing estate which has already seen the neighbourhood’s Edenham Residential Care Home knocked down&quot;, adding the tower to its &#x27;Buildings at Risk&#x27; list. The plans would also involve destroying a graffiti wall, and a campaign has been started to oppose the scheme.

== Cultural references ==
In recent years, Trellick Tower has become a London icon, appearing on T-shirts, featuring in adverts, films, and songs, and attracting visitors. The tower was the filming location for &quot;Shopping&quot; (1994), written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, and is featured in the film &quot;For Queen and Country&quot; (1988), starring Denzel Washington. Additionally, it can be seen in the films &quot;Withnail &amp; I&quot; (1987), &quot;London Kills Me&quot; (1991), &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2010) and &quot;Paddington&quot;(2014).

The tower is believed to have been the inspiration behind J. G. Ballard&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;High Rise&quot; (1975) and its 2016 film adaptation directed by Ben Wheatley. The tower also features in Martin Amis&#x27; black comedy novel &quot;London Fields&quot;. Several music videos have featured Trellick Tower, including releases from Blur (which refers to the tower in their song &quot;Best Days&quot;).

Trellick Tower has appeared in several television adverts, including idents for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2012 Olympics. The whole of one side of the building&#x27;s exterior was used for the credits for the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s television show &quot;Incredible Games&quot;, starring David Walliams, in the early 1990s. The tower was used as a filming location (and a character&#x27;s home) in &quot;The Professionals&quot; episode &quot;The Madness Of Mickey Hamilton&quot;. Additionally, the tower was used as the location of game developer Colin Ritman&#x27;s apartment in the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; interactive episode/film &quot;Bandersnatch&quot;. It was later featured on the cover for the &quot;Meanwhile&quot; EP produced by the band Gorillaz, after previously appearing in the music videos of both &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Powder&quot;.

In May 2024 the tower was celebrated in &quot;Andi Oliver&#x27;s Fabulous Feasts&quot; on BBC Two, with celebrity chef Andi Oliver.

<text>Lithobraking is a whimsical &quot;crash landing&quot; euphemism used by spacecraft engineers to refer to a spacecraft impacting the surface of a planet or moon. The word was coined by analogy with &quot;aerobraking&quot;, slowing a spacecraft by intersecting the atmosphere, with &quot;lithos&quot; ( [], &quot;rock&quot;) substituted to indicate the spacecraft is intersecting the planet&#x27;s solid lithosphere rather than merely its gaseous atmosphere. 

According to Jonathan McDowell, &quot;Lithobraking reduces the apoapsis height to zero instantly, but with the unfortunate side effect that the spacecraft does not survive. Originally a whimsical euphemism, but increasingly a standard term.&quot;

The term Lithobraking has been popularised by the video game &quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot; as an euphemism for spacecraft crashes.

== End-of-mission lithobraking ==
Lithobraking is used to refer to the result of a spacecraft crashing into the rocky surface of a body with no measures to ensure its survival, either by accident or with intent. For instance, the term has been used to describe the impact of &quot;MESSENGER&quot; into Mercury after the spacecraft ran out of fuel. More recently, the term has also been used to describe the successful completion of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), when a probe crashed into Dimorphos to test lithobraking as a method of planetary defense.

== Intact lithobraking ==
Successful lithobraking requires a spacecraft capable of impacting the planet or moon at high velocity, or protecting the probe with sufficient cushioning to withstand an impact with the surface undamaged. 

In the absence of a thick atmosphere, lithobraking is difficult due to the extremely high orbital velocities of most bodies. However, the orbital velocity of small moons (for example, Phobos), asteroids, and comets can be sufficiently small for this strategy to be feasible.

Instead of attempting to slowly dissipate the incoming velocity, it can be used to enable the probe to penetrate the surface. This can be tried on bodies with low gravitation, such as comets and asteroids, or on planets with atmospheres (by using only small parachutes, or no parachutes at all). Several such missions have been launched, including penetrators on the two Phobos probe landers targeted for Mars&#x27; moon Phobos and ones for Mars itself on Mars 96 and Deep Space 2, but so far none have succeeded.

<text>The 2nd New Zealand Division, initially the New Zealand Division, was an infantry division of the New Zealand Military Forces (New Zealand&#x27;s army) during the Second World War. The division was commanded for most of its existence by Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg. It fought in Greece, Crete, the Western Desert and Italy. In the Western Desert Campaign, the division played a prominent role in the defeat of German and Italian forces in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the British Eighth Army&#x27;s advance to Tunisia.

In late 1943, the division was moved to Italy, taking part in the Eighth Army&#x27;s campaign on Italy&#x27;s Adriatic coast, which ground to a halt at the end of the year. In early 1944, the division formed the nucleus of the New Zealand Corps, fighting two battles attempting unsuccessfully to penetrate the Gustav Line at Monte Cassino. The division saw further action on the Gothic Line in Italy in 1944 and took part in the Allied 1945 Spring offensive, which led to the surrender of German forces in Italy in May. After returning to New Zealand, reorganised elements of the division formed part of the occupational forces in Japan from 1945.

==History==

=== Formation ===

At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, it was decided that New Zealand should provide an Expeditionary Force. Initially a &#x27;Special Force&#x27; was to be raised, of one battalion in each of the three military districts, but the requirement was then raised, to that of a division. Major-General Bernard C. Freyberg, of the British Army, but with strong New Zealand connections, was appointed as General Officer Commanding. This force became known as 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and the division, initially, as the New Zealand Division. The first echelon, 2NZEF Headquarters and the 4th Infantry Brigade, left New Zealand in January and landed in Egypt on 12 February 1940. The second echelon, the 5th Infantry Brigade, was diverted to Britain on Italy&#x27;s entry into the war, joining the British VII Corps. Composite elements were formed into an extra brigade, 7th Brigade, to strengthen the invasion defences. The third echelon, the 6th Infantry Brigade, arrived in Egypt on 27 October 1940 and concentration of the division was completed after the second echelon, no longer required in Britain, reached Egypt the following March.

The division remained as part of the British Eighth Army to the end of World War II in 1945, during which it fought in the Battle of Greece (March–April 1941), the Battle of Crete (May 1941), Operation Crusader (November–December 1941), Minqar Qaim (June 1942), First Battle of El Alamein (July 1942), Second Battle of El Alamein (October–November 1942), Libya and Tunisia (December 1942 – May 1943), the Sangro (October–December 1943), Battle of Monte Cassino (February–March 1944), Central Italy (May–December 1944), and the Adriatic Coast (April–May 1945).

===Defence of Greece===
In March 1941, the division was deployed to Greece to assist British and Australian forces in defending the country from an expected German invasion. The New Zealanders were combined with Australian and British forces as &#x27;W Force&#x27; under Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. The immediate operational commander was Australian Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey with his I Australian Corps headquarters, which was briefly renamed Anzac Corps. On 6 April, the Germans launched their invasion, commencing the Battle of Greece. They overwhelmed the British and Commonwealth forces and forcing them to retreat to Crete and Egypt by 6 April. The last New Zealand troops had evacuated mainland Greece by 25 April, having sustained losses of 291 men killed, 387 seriously wounded, and 1,826 men captured in this campaign.

===Battle of Crete===

Since most 2nd New Zealand Division troops had evacuated to Crete from mainland Greece, they were very much involved in the defence of Crete against further German attacks. As Freyberg was judged to have performed extremely well during the evacuation of Greece, he was given command of all Allied forces for the defence of the island. Consequently, the New Zealand Division temporarily lost him as its commander. However, the attempt to defend Crete was as doomed as that to defend Greece had been.

The German paratroopers landed in May 1941. While suffering many casualties, the Germans gradually gained the upper hand over the Allied forces in the Battle of Crete. By the end of the month, German soldiers had once again overwhelmed British and Commonwealth forces, and it was decided to evacuate the division from the island, again without its heavy weapons. This evacuation was to Egypt, with the forces landing in Alexandria in June. The unit&#x27;s ability to help itself to enemy—and Allied—heavy weapons and transport led to it being nicknamed &quot;Freyberg&#x27;s Forty Thousand Thieves&quot;. In the Battle for Crete, 671 New Zealanders were killed, 967 wounded and 2,180 captured. During the battle, Charles Upham was awarded the first of his two Victoria Crosses.

===North Africa===

====Operation Crusader====
Following the disasters in Europe, the division was then integrated into the regular order of battle of the British Eighth Army. It fought in many of the critical battles in the North African Campaign over the next year and a half. On 18 November 1941, the division took part in Operation Crusader. The New Zealand troops crossed the Libyan frontier into Cyrenaica, and linked up with the British 70th Infantry Division of the Tobruk Garrison on 26 November. Operation Crusader was an overall success for the British and the New Zealand troops withdrew to Syria to recover. The campaign in Libya was the most costly that the 2nd New Zealand Division fought during the Second World War, with 879 men killed, and 1,700 wounded.

Originally known as the &#x27;New Zealand Division&#x27;, the division became known as 2nd New Zealand Division from June 1942 onward as part of the Operation Cascade deception scheme and the &#x27;formation&#x27; of Maadi Camp, the division&#x27;s base area in Egypt, as &quot;6th NZ Division&quot;.

====Mersa Matruh====

After the Eighth Army&#x27;s defeat in the Gazala battles, fresh forces were brought up to check the Axis forces in their drive into Egypt. The 2nd New Zealand Division was transported from Syria to Mersa Matruh. In the ensuing battle, the division&#x27;s retreat was cut off on 27 June when the 21st Panzer Division got to the east of the division. That night, the division&#x27;s 4th Brigade broke through the German positions, and the division retired to El Alamein.

====El Alamein====

The division played a prominent role in both Battles of El Alamein. During the First Battle of El Alamein, in July 1942, the division put in a night attack against the Afrika Korps, commanded by Erwin Rommel. As no armoured support was available to the division after their night attack against the Germans at Ruweisat Ridge, the 4th New Zealand Brigade was shattered, with the loss of around 3,000 men, during the fighting that resulted when German Panzers counter-attacked the New Zealand infantry the following morning. It was for his actions in this battle that Charles Upham was awarded the Bar to his VC, becoming only the third man to be awarded the VC twice and the first soldier in a combatant role. Also at Ruweisat, Sergeant Keith Elliott of 22nd Battalion was awarded the VC for continuing to lead his company, despite wounds, in assaults which led to the destruction of five machine guns plus an anti-tank gun and the capture of 130 prisoners.

During the Second Battle of El Alamein, the division broke through the German positions and got behind Rommel&#x27;s flank. During the night of 1–2 November 1942, the British 9th Armoured Brigade was to have advanced in support of an attack by the division. However, it was stopped in the minefield lanes by the 15th Panzer and 90th Light Divisions; the following morning, the armour continued to be attacked, suffering heavy losses. However, the 9th Armoured Brigade&#x27;s sacrifice had made the follow-up successes possible.

====Tunisia====
Following the victory at Alamein, the Eighth Army advanced west through Libya to El Agheila. For much of this time, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander since August 1942, was obliged to maintain a relatively small forward force because of the difficulties caused by a very extended supply line and the New Zealand Division was therefore held in reserve at Bardia. At the Battle of El Agheila, the New Zealand Division was brought forward with supporting tanks to conduct an outflanking movement while two divisions made a frontal attack. The battle started on the night of 11 December. Looking to preserve his forces, Rommel commenced a withdrawal to Buerat on the 12th.

The division then formed the left flank of the advancing Eighth Army and on 16 December had an opportunity to trap the retreating Axis forces. However, the division&#x27;s troops were strung out and without anti-tank guns. The 15th Panzer Division was therefore able to punch through and secure the line of retreat.

A further unsuccessful attempt to get to the rear of the withdrawing Axis forces took place at Nofaliya. The division then remained in reserve in the Nofaliya area until early January, when it was ordered forward to take part in the final push through Buerat and advance the remaining to Tripoli. The operation began on 15 January; by 21 January, Tripoli was less than ahead. However, skilful delaying tactics allowed the Axis forces to withdraw in good order and when leading elements of Eighth Army entered Tripoli in the early morning of 23 January its defenders had left.

The Eighth Army arrived on the Mareth defensive line on the border with Tunisia shortly after the fall of Tripoli. After an unsuccessful attempt to break through the Axis defenses at Mareth, the New Zealand Division was reinforced to form a New Zealand Corps to execute a left hook around the main Axis defenses through the Tebaga Gap. The attack was launched on 21 March and the entrance to the gap had been secured after four days fighting but no break through made. Further reinforcements from British X Corps were sent to the Tebaga Gap and overall control of the operation transferred to X Corps commander Brian Horrocks. Operation Supercharge II was launched on 26 March and by 28 March the main Axis forces on the Mareth Line had been forced to withdraw by the flanking threat from the advancing British 1st Armoured and New Zealand Divisions.

At the end of &quot;Supercharge II&quot;, the New Zealand Corps was broken up and its elements allocated between X and XXX Corps. On 30 March, Montgomery sent the following message to Freyberg:

The division continued to fight in Tunisia with Eighth Army until Tunis fell to First Army on 7 May, prompting the surrender of the remaining Axis forces.

During 1943, the division was involved in what was called the &quot;Furlough Mutiny&quot;. This was &quot;an affair that has received little attention in the literature of the Second World War&quot; but which according to the military historian Jonathan Fennell had significant military and political implications for New Zealand&#x27;s subsequent wartime role. Fennell asserts that the aftermath of the &#x27;mutiny&#x27; meant that &quot;the New Zealand soldier, to all intents and purposes, was able to negotiate the terms of his service in the second half of the war. As a result, 2nd New Zealand Division would fight some of its hardest battles without its most experienced veterans.&quot;

===Italian Campaign===

Following the Axis surrender in Tunisia the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to refit and therefore took no part in the Allied invasion of Sicily. The refit included the conversion of the 4th Infantry Brigade into the 4th Armoured Brigade. The division returned to battle in the Italian Campaign in late 1943, rejoining the Eighth Army. The division came into the front line in November and took part in the advance across the Sangro at the end of the month. During December the division was involved in very heavy fighting during the Moro River Campaign at Orsogna. By the end of the year the deteriorating winter weather made movement of even tracked vehicles impossible except on metaled roads and severely impeded vital close air support operations. This, together with the failure to capture Orsogna led the Allies to call off the Adriatic coast offensive until spring brought better conditions in the skies and under foot.

In response to complaints from the troops, the New Zealand government extended a three month furlough was to those in the Mediterranean who had been in service longest with the result that about 6,000 of the most experienced troops of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force returned to New Zealand including about a third of the division. The mood of those was not improved by the break from Italy. They found a large number of fighting-fit men were exempt from conscription due to being classed as in essential occupations. Wages had also risen in response to the lack of labour in the market so the differential from a soldiers pay was even higher. In the resulting Furlough Mutiny many refused to return to Italy; between exemptions granted and desertions about 13% of those furloughed returned leaving the division depleted of experienced troops. Although news of the mutiny was suppressed, the soldiers remaining in Italy were well aware of the situation leading to a drop in morale.

====Monte Cassino====

Meanwhile, to the west of the Eighth Army on the other side of the Apennine Mountains, Italy&#x27;s central mountain spine, the U.S. Fifth Army had also been fighting its way north. By the end of January 1944, the Fifth Army&#x27;s attacks against the Cassino massif had ground to a halt and the &quot;Battle for Rome&quot; had stalled. The 15th Army Group commander General Sir Harold Alexander and Fifth Army commander Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark looked around for solutions to penetrate the defences, as their careers and reputations were irrevocably linked with success on this front, particularly due to Winston Churchill&#x27;s insistence at this time, that Italy was the key to the ultimate success in the war. As part of the solution, Alexander withdrew the 2nd New Zealand Division from the Eighth Army line to establish a small Army Group Reserve with a view to reinforcing the Fifth Army front. Clark was initially apprehensive of making use of an ex-British Eighth Army Division. As an American, he was even more apprehensive of having Freyberg, whom he considered a &quot;prima donna&quot; who &quot;had to be handled with kid gloves&quot; leading the Army Reserve. Clark feared that, due to Freyberg&#x27;s extensive experience, he would question or dispute his orders. What concerned him most was that he feared that General Alexander might decide to use the New Zealand Corps to replace Major General Geoffrey Keyes&#x27; U.S. II Corps and &quot;snatch the victory which the Americans had so dearly bought&quot;. The failure of the New Zealand Corps to capture Cassino reduced these fears and eventually made Clark more amenable towards the New Zealand Corps. Alexander also withdrew the 4th Indian Infantry Division as well as the British 78th Infantry Division from Eighth Army to join this strategic reserve. This formation was initially known as &quot;Spadger Force&quot; to confuse German intelligence, with the commander, General Freyberg being known as &quot;Spadger&quot;. The Corps later became known as the New Zealand Corps under command of the U.S. Fifth Army. The &quot;New Zealand Corps&quot; was not, however, a truly of corps size, since it lacked a full staff and set of corps troops. It was more a temporary extension of the division - New Zealand simply did not have the resources to fully man a corps level formation.

====Second Battle for Cassino====
On 8 February, Clark conceded to Alexander that U.S. II Corps would not succeed with any further attacks and he &quot;allowed&quot; the British (and Dominions) to attempt to strike the final blow against the Axis line at Cassino. By this time, U.S. VI Corps had already landed at Anzio and were under heavy threat from the reinforcing Germans. An outright destruction of the Anzio beachhead was a possibility, given the relentless enemy air, artillery, and ground assaults against VI Corps. General Alexander advised Freyberg to ready the NZ Corps to take over from U.S. II Corps, under Major General Geoffrey Keyes, also advising him that enemy reinforcements had arrived and that even greater resistance could be expected.

Freyberg&#x27;s plan initially included a wide flanking attack—differentiating it from the approach previously used by Keyes&#x27; II Corps. This flanking movement was eventually excluded from the final plan and Freyberg dictated that the attack be along the same unsuccessful lines as used by the Americans the month before. Major-General Francis Tuker, commander of the 4th Indian Division, voiced strong disapproval regarding the plan to Freyberg, his new Corps Commander—as his division was to lead the now, frontal assault. Tuker also expressed his concern over Freyberg&#x27;s apparent obsession with reducing the monastery on Monte Cassino, arguing that (supported by General Juin, commanding the French Expeditionary Corps) they were attempting to breach the strongest and most fortified point of the Gustav Line. As part of his plan, and encouraged by the complaints from Tucker, Freyberg insisted to Clark that the monastery should be flattened by bombing in the preparatory stage of the attack. General Alexander, although expressing the opinion that it would be regrettable to destroy the Benedictine Order monastery-built around AD 529—supported Freyberg&#x27;s insistence that reducing the monastery be considered a military necessity.

The Allied planes dropped 442 tons of bombs on the Abbey and its immediate environs in two separate attacks on 15 February, one between 09:30 and 10:00 and the other between 10:30 and 13:30, but the infantry attack, which was to commence directly after the second bombing mission, was delayed due to differences regarding H-Hour between Freyberg and his 7th Indian Brigade. Also, the division commanders were insisting that a preliminary high-point (Point 593) was to be captured as a prelude to the main attack.

The 4th Indian Division was to attack in an arc towards the south and south west, taking Point 593 and then moving south east, up the heights towards the Abbey. The 4th Indian Division would only advance on the Abbey, once the NZ Division had attacked south and south east taking the town of Cassino. The main attack eventually commenced just after last light with the 28th (Maori) Battalion tasked to cross the Rapido River and to seize the station south of Cassino town, to establish a bridgehead for the corps armour to move into the town and to the foot of the Cassino massif—the attack starting at 21:30. By dawn, German 10th Army artillery had stopped the 28th Battalion advance on the Rapido River bridgehead and the NZ Division were forced to use all their guns to fire smoke onto the bridge and railway station areas to mask the withdrawal of the 28th Battalion. The attack had failed, and so had the 4th Indian Division attack on Point 593.

====Third Battle====
On the evening of 14 March, the battalions of the NZ Corps were alerted that Operation Bradman, the bombing of Cassino, was approved for the next day. In a third attempt to penetrate the Gustav Line, the Corps was again launched against Cassino town and the monastery on top of the massif. By this time, U.S. VI Corps, which had landed at Anzio some two months before, had still not been able to break out of its beachhead, though pressure on the beachhead had significantly decreased since the beginning of the month. This third assault on Cassino was intended to not only penetrate the Gustav Line, but to draw away the German forces to further alleviate the pressure on the VI Corps at Anzio.

The bombing started at 08:00 and continued till 12:00—dropping an equivalent of four tons per acre. By 12:30, an 890 gun artillery bombardment started, which would continue for eight hours. The 6th NZ Brigade lead the attack, assaulting Cassino town, supported by the tanks of the 19th Armoured Regiment and at the same time, the 4th Indian Division was to advance on Hangman&#x27;s Hill after which they were to assault the Monastery. The next morning, the 4th NZ Armoured Brigade was to take over from American tanks in the Liri Valley while the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade and small NZ tank groups were to advance up the Cavendish Road (built by Indian engineers) to clear any pockets of resistance on the Cassino slopes.

The advance into Cassino town by the 6th NZ Brigade went wrong from the start as the 19th Armoured tanks were unable to pass through the badly damaged roads, covered in rubble and bomb craters. The infantry, advancing without tanks came under severe fire from German paratroopers in the town, their fire further preventing armoured engineer bulldozers from clearing access routes for the tanks. Although the armour had been stopped, the NZ Infantry still held some parts of the town, including the strategic Castle Hill. Freyberg&#x27;s orders had defined that the 4th Indian Division would only commence their advance on the Abbey, once Castle Hill had been secured, as they were to pass through the NZ lines on the hill as they progressed up the mountain. It took two hours to pass the message that the hill had been secured and as it was already dark, further delays were encountered by the Indian Division struggling to find Castle Hill. The Indian advance on Hangman&#x27;s Hill only commenced after midnight, further compounded by heavy rain.

The next morning, while concentrated German artillery fire and house to house fighting pinned the 2nd New Zealand Division in that portion of the town which they held, the 4th Indian Division was making no progress up the mountain. The 20th Armoured Regiment which was to have supported them, considered the road too risky, as numerous hairpin bends had not been secured. German reinforcements continued to arrive, bolstering the defences in town, as well as on the Cassino massif. Attempts by the NZ Division to expand their perimeter in town continued on 16 March—XIV Panzer Corps reported in this regard &quot;... south of the town, the enemy [the NZ Division] fought our foremost posts to a standstill by weight of fire and then occupied the station after hand-to-hand fighting ... [but] the centre of the town is still in our hands.&quot;

By the afternoon of 19 March, it was evident that no further progress would be made by the NZ Division in Cassino town—the German paratrooper line held firm, with machine gun, mortar and sniper fire and continued counter-attacks to reduce the NZ perimeter. By 20 March a company of Gurkhas overran Point 435 on Hangman&#x27;s Hill, 500 yards from the Abbey, but were again driven back by German fire from unassailable positions. The NZ Division re-occupied the railway station and the botanical gardens in the town and the process of attack and counterattack continued until 23 March when Alexander decided to call off the offensive. The Monte Cassino Abbey, although totally destroyed by now, remained firmly in German hands.

====Advance to the Gothic Line====

Following the two assaults at Monte Cassino, the New Zealand Division was withdrawn and when redeployed found itself in the high Apennine sector north east of Cassino under the British Eighth Army&#x27;s X Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Richard L. McCreery. When in May 1944 the Allies launched their final and successful offensive on the Cassino front, X Corps was employed in a holding role making diversionary feints and anchoring the right flank of the Eighth Army attack. Some of the division&#x27;s armoured elements were detached, however, and placed under command of the British 4th Infantry Division and 8th Indian Infantry Division to take part in XIII Corps attack in the centre of the front. When the New Zealand tanks returned from 8th Indian Division in early June, Major-General Dudley Russell, the 8th Indian Division&#x27;s commander wrote to Freyberg saying: As the main attack advanced, X Corps with the New Zealand Division moved forward to maintain protection of Eighth Army&#x27;s right flank. After the fall of Rome in early June X Corps formed a pursuit force comprising 2nd New Zealand and 8th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions. On 10 June elements of the division entered Avezzano and the division passed into army reserve to spend a period of rest and training.

In mid July, the division joined British XIII Corps, under Lieutenant-General Sidney C. Kirkman, at the Trasimene Line as reinforcements ahead of a set piece offensive planned to carry an advance to Arezzo. The New Zealand Division acted as guard to the right flank of the corps. Arezzo was captured on 16 July and the advance was continued towards the River Arno and Florence. The New Zealand Division&#x27;s capture of the eastern crests of the Pian dei Cerri hills at the start of August was the turning point of the battle for Florence. Florence was declared an open city and Allied troops entered on 4 August. Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese, the Eighth Army commander wrote:

In the autumn of 1944, the division fought as part of I Canadian Corps during Operation Olive, the offensive on the Gothic Line. In November 1944 it was then transferred to British V Corps. With one armoured and two infantry brigades, the division was well organised for mobile warfare as experienced in North Africa. In the mountainous terrain and difficult conditions underfoot found in Italy, however, tank mobility was very restricted and the division always found itself short of infantry. During the winter of 1944–45 the Divisional Cavalry Regiment and 22nd (Motor) Battalion were converted to infantry, giving each infantry brigade a fourth battalion. By the spring of 1945 the 27th Machine-Gun Battalion had also been converted to infantry and the division&#x27;s infantry reorganized into three brigades each with three battalions. Manpower shortages in the division were also eased when the 3rd New Zealand Division, then fighting in the Pacific War against the Japanese, had been disbanded in October 1944 and 4,000 of its officers and men then transferred to the 2nd NZ Division.

In April 1945, the division, still as part of British V Corps with 8th Indian Division, was performing assault crossings of first the Senio stream and then the river Santerno between Ravenna and Bologna, marking the start of the Allied spring 1945 offensive in Italy. The division was subsequently transferred to XIII Corps and the closing days of the Second World War saw the 2nd New Zealand Division race to Trieste in northern Italy to work with Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s partisans, and liberate the city from German troops.

===Aftermath===
By the end of the war, the New Zealand Division had a reputation as a tough formation with good troops. This opinion had earlier been expressed by Rommel in his report to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht on 21 July 1942 (at the end of the First Battle of El Alamein) in which he highly rated the New Zealand Division. This view was repeated within the German 5th Panzer Division intelligence reports. Rommel also paid tribute to the division in his memoirs:

General Bernard Montgomery, who commanded the Eighth Army and who would later command the Allied land forces in the invasion of Normandy, recommended that the division should be used in the invasion of Normandy but the New Zealand government did not approve the move. This was because the division was fighting at Monte Cassino at the time.

Captain Charles Upham, VC and Bar, of the New Zealand Division, was the only person to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice during the Second World War. Other Victoria Crosses were awarded to Jack Hinton, Alfred Hulme, Keith Elliott, and Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu. Lance Sergeant Haane Manahi of the Māori Battalion was posthumously honoured in 2007 by representatives of the Queen after it was decided that his Distinguished Conduct Medal, awarded for actions at Takrouna, was not to be upgraded to a Victoria Cross, despite recommendations from senior officers, including Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks.

Elements of the division, the 9th Brigade, were reorganized as the division disbanded to become J Force, (Japan), the New Zealand contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan.

<text>The beholder is a fictional monster in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. It is depicted as a floating orb of flesh with a large mouth, single central eye, and many smaller eyestalks on top with powerful magical abilities.

The beholder is among the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; monsters that have appeared in every edition of the game since 1975. Beholders are one of the few classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons monsters that Wizards of the Coast claims as Product Identity and as such was not released under its Open Game License. Beholders have been used on the cover of different &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; handbooks, including the fifth edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot;.

== Publication history ==
Unlike many other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; monsters, the beholder is an original creation for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, as it is not based on a creature from mythology or other fiction. Rob Kuntz&#x27;s brother Terry Kuntz created the &quot;Beholder&quot;, and Gary Gygax detailed it for publication.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1974–1976) ===
The beholder was introduced with the first &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; supplement, &quot;Greyhawk&quot; (1975), and is depicted on its cover (as shown in the section below). It is described as a &quot;Sphere of Many Eyes&quot; or &quot;Eye Tyrant&quot;, a levitating globe with ten magical eye stalks. The beholder later appears in the &quot;Companion Rules&quot; set, in the &quot;Dungeon Masters Companion: Book Two&quot; (1984). In 1991, it appeared in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia&quot;.

=== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition (1977–1988) ===
With the release of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition, the beholder appeared in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977), where it is described as a hateful, aggressive, avaricious spherical monster that is most frequently found underground. Ed Greenwood and Roger E. Moore authored &quot;The Ecology of the Beholder&quot;, which featured in &quot;Dragon&quot; #76 (August 1983).

=== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition (1989–1999) ===
Second edition supplements to &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, especially those of the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; campaign setting, added further details about these classic creatures&#x27; societies and culture. Beholders feature prominently in the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; setting, and a number of variants and related creatures are introduced in the &quot;&quot; campaign set, in the &quot;Lorebook of the Void&quot; booklet (1989). It also appeared in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume One&quot; (1989), and is reprinted in the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993). The beholder was featured on an &quot;AD&amp;D Trading Card&quot; (1991). The book &quot;I, Tyrant&quot; (1996), and the &quot;Monstrous Arcana&quot; module series that accompanies it, develops the beholder further. &quot;I, Tyrant&quot; is a supplement focused on beholders, and builds on the known information about beholders by expanding on elements such as their history, religion, culture, habitations and behavior.

Based on Tom Wham&#x27;s depiction in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, TSR artist Keith Parkinson characterized its popular appearance with plate-like armored scales and arthropod-like eyestalks. Jeff Grubb cites Keith Parkinson&#x27;s artwork as the inspiration for the beholder-kin created for the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; campaign setting. The Beholder&#x27;s xenophobia towards other subraces of Beholders was added after Jim Holloway submitted multiple designs for the Beholder&#x27;s spelljamming ship and Jeff Grubb decided to keep them all and used xenophobia to explain the differences in design style.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.0 edition (2000–2002) ===
The third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; included the Beholder in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2000) with the expanded monster statistics of this release. Beholder variants appear in &quot;Monstrous Compendium: Monsters of Faerûn&quot; (2001). &quot;Epic Level Handbook&quot; (2002) introduces the Gibbering Orb, a purported common ancestor of the beholder and gibbering mouther.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition (2003–2007) ===
The beholder appears in the revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for the 3.5 edition (2003). The mindwitness was a sample creature of the half-illithid template using a beholder as the base creature, featured on Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s website on August 14, 2003. The beholder receives its own chapter in the book &quot;Lords of Madness: The Book of Aberrations&quot; (2005).

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition (2008–2014) ===
With the release of the fourth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the beholder once again appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2008), including the &quot;beholder eye of flame&quot; and the &quot;beholder eye tyrant&quot;. Variants of the beholder also appear in &quot;Monster Manual 2&quot; (2009), and &quot;Monster Manual 3&quot; (2010).

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition (2014–present) ===
The beholder appears along with the more powerful undead death tyrant and the spectator in the 5th edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2014). Additionally, a zombie beholder also appears under the &quot;zombies&quot; section later in the book. &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Monsters&quot; (2016) provides more detail on beholder culture and contains stats for the death kiss, gauth and gazer beholder-kin. The half-illithid mindwitness also makes an appearance in this book. The book &quot;Xanathar&#x27;s Guide to Everything&quot; (2017) contains various notes written from the perspective of the beholder known as Xanathar. Xanathar is also one of the possible villains adventurers can face in the adventure module &quot;&quot; (2018).

== Description ==
A beholder is an &quot;aberration&quot; comprising a floating spheroid body with a large fanged mouth and single eye on the front and many flexible eyestalks on the top. It is protected by chitinous plates.

Each eye of a beholder possesses a different magical ability; the main eye projects an anti-magical cone, and the other eyes have different spell-like abilities (disintegrate objects, transmute flesh to stone, cause sleep, slow the motion of objects or beings, charm animals, charm humans, cause death, induce fear, levitate objects, and inflict serious wounds). Many variant beholder species exist, such as &quot;observers&quot;, &quot;spectators&quot;, &quot;eyes of the deep&quot;, &quot;elder orbs&quot;, &quot;hive mothers&quot;, and &quot;death tyrants&quot;. In addition, some rare beholders can use their eyes for non-standard spell-like abilities; these mutant beholders are often killed or exiled by their peers. Beholders wishing to cast spells like ordinary wizards relinquish the traditional use of their eyestalks, and put out their central anti-magic eye, making these beholder mages immediate outcasts.

In 4th edition, different breeds of beholders have different magic abilities. Beholder Eyes of Flame only have &quot;Fear&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, and &quot;Telekinesis Rays&quot;; Eyes of Frost are the same, with fire replaced by frost. The Beholder Eye Tyrant is mostly unchanged from traditional beholders, but the &quot;Death Ray&quot; causes ongoing necrotic damage rather than an instant kill, and the &quot;Disintegration Ray&quot; does not automatically kill its target. Other beholder types each have their own set of abilities. In this edition, the beholder&#x27;s central eye no longer cancels out magic, instead dazing or giving some vulnerability to its victim.

=== Society ===

Beholders are extremely xenophobic. They will sometimes take members of other, non-beholder races as slaves; however, they will engage in a violent intra-species war with others of their kind who differ even slightly in appearance. This intense hatred of other beholders is not universal; the most prominent exceptions are Hive Mothers, who use their powers of mind control to form hives with other beholders and beholder-kin. Beholder communities in the Underdark often, when provoked, wage war on any and all nearby settlements, finding the most resistance from the drow and illithids.

Beholders worship their insane, controlling goddess known as the Great Mother, though some also, or instead, follow her rebel offspring, Gzemnid, the beholder god of gases.

Some beholder strains have mutated far from the basic beholder stock. These are aberrant beholders, of which there are numerous different types. These aberrants may have differing abilities and/or appearances but the unifying feature among beholders and the various aberrant beholders seems to be a simple, fleshy body with one or more grotesque eyes.

== Campaign settings ==

=== &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; ===

Beholders are especially prominent in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting, where they infiltrate and seek to control many sectors of society—many beholders are allied to the Zhentarim, some work with the Red Wizards of Thay, and a particularly powerful beholder, known as &quot;The Evil Eye&quot; or &quot;The Xanathar&quot; controls Skullport&#x27;s influential Thieves Guild. (&quot;The Xanathar&quot; is the title of the thieves guild leader, passed from one to the next.) Beholders also compete to control the Underdark from where most of them originate, with their base of power in the City of the Eye Tyrants, Ootul.

=== &quot;Spelljammer&quot; ===
According to Ken Rolston, the beholder and the mind flayer &quot;win starring roles as intergalactic menaces&quot; in &quot;Spelljammer&quot;, and notes that the beholders, &quot;with their abundant magical powers, are perhaps the most formidable warrior race of the universe, but fortunately they are too busy slaughtering one another to present a big threat to other spacefaring races&quot;.

Beholders in the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; campaign are common antagonists, like the deadly neogi and sadistic illithids. However, one thing prevents them from being the most dangerous faction in wildspace: the beholders are engaged in a xenophobic civil war of genetic purity.

There are a large number of variations in the beholder race with some sub-races having smooth hides and others chitinous plates. Other noticeable differences include snakelike eyestalks or crustacean like eyestalk joints. Some variations seem minor such as variations in the size of the central eye or differences in skin colour. Each beholder nation believes itself to be the true beholder race and sees other beholders as ugly copies that must be destroyed.

Lone beholders in wildspace are often refugees who have survived an attack that exterminated the rest of their nest or are outcasts who were expelled for having some form of mutation. The most famous lone beholder is Large Luigi, who works as a barkeeper on the Rock of Bral.

Beholders use a large number of different ship designs. Some of these ships feature a piercing ram but others have no weaponry. All beholder ships allow a circuit of beholders to focus their eye stalks into a 400-yard beam of magical energy. These ships are powered and navigated by the &quot;orbus&quot; (plural &quot;orbii&quot;) race of beholders, who are stunted, albino, and very weak in combat.

=== &quot;Eberron&quot; ===

In the &quot;Eberron&quot; campaign setting, beholders served as living artillery during the Daelkyr incursion, using the terrible power of their eyes to shatter whole goblin armies. Beholders do not reproduce naturally and have not created a culture of their own—they are simply the immortal servants of the daelkyr. Most continue to serve their masters, commanding subterranean outposts of aberrations or serving as the hidden leaders of various Cults of the Dragon Below. Others lead solitary lives, contemplating mysteries or studying the world. Such lone beholders may manipulate humanoid communities, but their actions are rarely driven by a desire for personal power.

Members of the Cults of the Dragon Below believe that these creatures function as the eyes of a greater power. Some insist that they serve Belashyrra, a powerful Daelkyr who is also known as the Lord of Eyes. Others claim the beholders are the eyes of Xoriat itself—that while they serve the daelkyr, they are conduits to a power even greater and more terrible than the shapers of flesh.

== Variants and kin ==
Information about beholder variations and related creatures has been made available in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; publications.

== Reception ==
A reviewer for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine described the beholder: &quot;11 eyes, paranoid, xenophobic, having a taste for live animals and being deadly with magic.&quot;

Artist Chris Hagerty called the beholder a &quot;creature that looks at you and is destroying you by the power of its magical eyes&quot;.

&quot;Wizard&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 100 greatest villains ever list selected the beholder as the 99th-greatest villain. Rob Bricken from io9 named the beholder as the most memorable D&amp;D monster.

SyFy Wire in 2018 called it one of &quot;The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, saying that &quot;Beholders are an iconic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; monster and one you don&#x27;t want to come face to eyestalk with if you can help it.&quot;

The beholder (gauth) was ranked sixth among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons For Dummies&quot;. The authors described the true beholder as an iconic creature of the game, &quot;What could be more fantastic than a giant floating eyeball with little eye stalks sticking out, all of which shoot magic rays?&quot; Of the gauth, the authors say &quot;its ability to inflict a bewildering variety of damage on a party of heroes is unparalleled... until they fight a true beholder, that is.&quot;

The &quot;Envoyer&quot; magazine called the beholder a terrible beast, properly shown as such in the 3rd edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, in contrast to earlier depictions where it rather looked like &quot;a cuddly rosy ball with too many eyes&quot;.

Richard W. Forest commented in &quot;The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters&quot; that the beholder was designed to counter magic-using characters while being a formidable opponent for a whole party due to its versatility.

The beholder was considered one of the &quot;game&#x27;s signature monsters&quot; by Philip J. Clements, while &quot;Backstab&quot; reviewer Philippe Tessier called it a &quot;classic of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&quot;.

Witwer &quot;et al.&quot; considered the beholder &quot;iconic&quot;, &quot;the brand&#x27;s signature beast&quot; and &quot;one of the most feared and fearsome monsters of the game&quot;.

* The Beholder Eye Tyrant was included as a random packed figure in &quot;D&amp;D Miniatures: Dangerous Delves&quot; (#5/40) (2009).
* The Beholder Ultimate Tyrant was available as a visible piece &quot;Legendary Evils&quot; set (#6/40) (2009).

=== Media unrelated to Dungeons &amp; Dragons ===
* The movie &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; (1986) features a Beholder-like monster whose main job is spying the protagonists.
* Beholders appeared as a boss and recurring monster in the original Japanese version of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, but was renamed to &quot;Evil Eye&quot; and redesigned for the game&#x27;s North American release to avoid copyright issues with TSR. Current installments of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series have continued to use the monster with the design and name heavily altered.
*Beholders appear as a recruitable unit in the 1999 video game &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III&quot;. Once upgraded, these units are renamed to &quot;Evil Eyes&quot;.
* The &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back&quot; features a beholder who guards the Central Bureaucracy. He is a Grade 11 bureaucrat who begs the Planet Express crew not to tell its supervisor that he was sleeping on the job. He has another cameo in &quot;Lethal Inspection&quot;, still working at the Central Bureaucracy.
*A parody of the Beholder, named &quot;The Beholster&quot;, appears as a boss in &quot;Enter the Gungeon&quot;, an &quot;indie game&quot; that includes numerous other references to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
* The &quot;Goblin Slayer&quot; series features a &quot;Giant Eyeball&quot; (episode 8 of the anime and volume 5 of the manga), which closely resembles a beholder with disintegration and magic dispelling abilities.
*A beholder appears in the 2020 Pixar Animation Studios film &quot;Onward&quot;. The film&#x27;s credits include a thanks to Wizards of the Coast for allowing them to use the beholder and the gelatinous cube.
*In the MMORPG Tibia, the monsters now known as &quot;Bonelords&quot; and &quot;Elder Bonelords&quot; used to be named, respectively, &quot;Beholders&quot; and &quot;Elder Beholders&quot;, from their insertion in the game on May 20, 1998, until a small patch released on August 23, 2010. In a newspost on the official Tibia website, Cipsoft GmbH announced the change to have happened, in lore, due to interference by &quot;wizards of the coast of a remote kingdom full of dungeons and dragons&quot; that &quot;suddenly appeared on the Tibian shores&quot;.

<text>A blood smear, peripheral blood smear or blood film is a thin layer of blood smeared on a glass microscope slide and then stained in such a way as to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood smears are examined in the investigation of hematological (blood) disorders and are routinely employed to look for blood parasites, such as those of malaria and filariasis.

==Preparation==
A blood smear is made by placing a drop of blood on one end of a slide, and using a &quot;spreader slide&quot; to disperse the blood over the slide&#x27;s length. The aim is to get a region, called a monolayer, where the cells are spaced far enough apart to be counted and differentiated. The monolayer is found in the &quot;feathered edge&quot; created by the spreader slide as it draws the blood forward.

The slide is left to air dry, after which the blood is fixed to the slide by immersing it briefly in methanol. The fixative is essential for good staining and presentation of cellular detail. After fixation, the slide is stained to distinguish the cells from each other.

Routine analysis of blood in medical laboratories is usually performed on blood films stained with Romanowsky stains such as Wright&#x27;s stain, Giemsa stain, or Diff-Quik. Wright-Giemsa combination stain is also a popular choice. These stains allow for the detection of white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet abnormalities. Hematopathologists often use other specialized stains to aid in the differential diagnosis of blood disorders.

After staining, the monolayer is viewed under a microscope using magnification up to 1000 times. Individual cells are examined and their morphology is characterized and recorded.

==Clinical significance==
Blood smear examination is usually performed in conjunction with a complete blood count in order to investigate abnormal results or confirm results that the automated analyzer has flagged as unreliable.

Microscopic examination of the shape, size, and coloration of red blood cells is useful for determining the cause of anemia. Disorders such as iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, megaloblastic anemia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia result in characteristic abnormalities on the blood film.

The proportions of different types of white blood cells can be determined from the blood smear. This is known as a manual white blood cell differential. The white blood cell differential can reveal abnormalities in the proportions of white blood cell types, such as neutrophilia and eosinophilia, as well as the presence of abnormal cells such as the circulating blast cells seen in acute leukemia. Qualitative abnormalities of white blood cells, like toxic granulation, are also visible on the blood smear. Modern complete blood count analyzers can provide an automated white blood cell differential, but they have a limited ability to differentiate immature and abnormal cells, so manual examination of the blood smear is frequently indicated.

Blood smear examination is the preferred diagnostic method for certain parasitic infections, such as malaria and babesiosis. Rarely, bacteria may be visible on the blood smear in patients with severe sepsis.

==Malaria==

The preferred and most reliable diagnosis of malaria is microscopic examination of blood smears, because each of the four major parasite species has distinguishing characteristics. Two sorts of blood smear are traditionally used.
* Thin smears are similar to usual blood films and allow species identification, because the parasite&#x27;s appearance is best preserved in this preparation.
* Thick smears allow the microscopist to screen a larger volume of blood and are about eleven times more sensitive than the thin film, so picking up low levels of infection is easier on the thick film, but the appearance of the parasite is much more distorted and therefore distinguishing between the different species can be much more difficult.

From the thick smear, an experienced microscopist can detect all parasites they encounter. Microscopic diagnosis can be difficult because the early trophozoites (&quot;ring form&quot;) of all four species look identical and it is never possible to diagnose species on the basis of a single ring form; species identification is always based on several trophozoites.

The biggest pitfall in most laboratories in developed countries is leaving too great a delay between taking the blood sample and making the blood smears. As blood cools to room temperature, male gametocytes will divide and release microgametes: these are long sinuous filamentous structures that can be mistaken for organisms such as &quot;Borrelia&quot;. If the blood is kept at warmer temperatures, will rupture and merozoites invading erythrocytes will mistakenly give the appearance of the accolé form of &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. If &quot;P. vivax&quot; or &quot;P. ovale&quot; is left for several hours in EDTA, the buildup of acid in the sample will cause the parasitised erythrocytes to shrink and the parasite will roll up, simulating the appearance of &quot;P. malariae&quot;. This problem is made worse if anticoagulants such as heparin or citrate are used. The anticoagulant that causes the least problems is EDTA. Romanowsky stain or a variant stain is usually used. Some laboratories mistakenly use the same staining pH as they do for routine haematology blood films (pH 6.8): malaria blood films must be stained at pH 7.2, or Schüffner&#x27;s dots and James&#x27; dots will not be seen.

Immunochromatographic capture procedures (rapid diagnostic tests such as the malaria antigen detection tests) are nonmicroscopic diagnostic options for the laboratory that may not have appropriate microscopy expertise available.

<text>Hazing (US English), initiation, beasting (British English), bastardisation (Australian English), ragging (South Asian English) or deposition refers to any activity expected of someone in joining or participating in a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses, or endangers them regardless of a person&#x27;s willingness to participate.

Hazing is seen in many different types of social groups, including gangs, sports teams, schools, cliques, universities, law enforcement, military units, prisons, fraternities and sororities, and even workplaces in some cases. The initiation rites can range from relatively benign pranks to protracted patterns of behavior that rise to the level of abuse or criminal misconduct.

Hazing is often prohibited by law or institutions such as colleges and universities because it may include either physical or psychological abuse, such as humiliation, nudity, or sexual abuse. Hazing activities have sometimes caused injuries or deaths.

While one explanation for hazing is that it increases group cohesion or solidarity, laboratory and observational evidence on its impacts on solidarity are inconclusive. Other explanations include displaying dominance, eliminating less committed members, and protecting groups that provide large automatic benefits for membership from exploitation by new members.

==Terms==
In some languages, terms with a religious theme or etymology are preferred, such as baptism or purgatory (e.g. in Belgian French, in Belgian Dutch, in Polish) or variations on a theme of naïveté and the rite of passage such as a derivation from a term for freshman, for example in European French, (&#x27;de-ing&#x27;) in Dutch and Afrikaans (South Africa and Namibia), in Spanish, from , meaning newcomer or rookie or a combination of both, such as in the Finnish (literally &#x27;moped baptism&#x27;). In Latvian, the word , which means &#x27;in-blessings&#x27;, is used, also standing for religious rites of passage, especially confirmation. In Swedish, the term used is , literally &#x27;zeroing&#x27;, as the first-year hazees still are &#x27;zeroes&#x27; before attending their first year. In Portugal, the term , which means &#x27;practice&#x27; or &#x27;habit&#x27;, is used for initiation.

At education establishments in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, this practice involves existing students baiting new students and is called ragging. In Polish schools, hazing is known as (literally &#x27;catting&#x27;, coming from the noun cat). It often features cat-related activities, like competitive milk-drinking . Other popular tasks include measuring a long distance (i.e., hallways) with matches. Less loaded names for hazing are (related to the verb &#x27;get over, rally&#x27; but also &#x27;shake off/out&#x27;—as being a novice is a negative state that should be quit) and mentioned above.

Hazings are sometimes concentrated in a single session, which may be called a &quot;hell night&quot;, prolonged to a &quot;hell week&quot;, or over a long period, resembling fagging.

In the Italian military, the term used was , from (literally &#x27;grandfather&#x27;), a jargon term used for the soldiers who had already served for most of their draft period. A similar equivalent term exists in the Russian military, where a hazing phenomenon known as () exists, meaning roughly &#x27;grandfather&#x27; or the slang term &#x27;gramps&#x27; (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of conscription).

==Methods==

One way of initiating a new member into a street gang is for multiple other members of the gang to assault the new member with a beating.

Hazing activities can involve ridicule and humiliation within the group or in public, while other hazing incidents are akin to pranks. A snipe hunt is such a prank when a newcomer or credulous person is given an impossible task. Examples of snipe hunts include being sent to find a tin of Tartan paint or a &quot;dough repair kit&quot; in a bakery, While in the early 1900s, rookies in the Canadian military were ordered to obtain a &quot;brass magnet&quot; when brass is not magnetic.

Spanking is done mainly in the form of paddling among fraternities, sororities, and similar clubs. This practice is also used in the military. 

The hazee may be humiliated by being hosed or by sprinklers or buckets, covered with dirt or with (sometimes rotten) food, or even urinated upon. Olive or baby oil may be used to &quot;show off&quot; the bare skin, for wrestling, or just for slipperiness (e.g., to complicate pole climbing). Cleaning may be limited to a dive into the water, hosing down, or even paddling the worst off. They may have to do tedious cleaning, including swabbing the decks or cleaning the toilets with a toothbrush. In fraternities, pledges often must clean up a mess intentionally made by brothers, including fecal matter, urine, and dead animals.

Servitude such as waiting on others (as at fraternity parties) or other forms of housework may be involved, often with obedience tests. Sometimes, the hazee may be made to eat raw eggs, peppers, hot sauce, or drink too much alcohol. Some hazing even includes eating or drinking vile things such as bugs or rotting food.
The hazee may have to wear an imposed piece of clothing, outfit, item, or something else worn by the victim in a way that would bring negative attention to the wearer. Examples include a uniform (e.g., toga), a leash or collar (also associated with bondage), infantile and other humiliating dress and attire.

Markings may also be made on clothing or bare skin. They are painted, written, tattooed, or shaved on, sometimes collectively forming a message (one letter, syllable, or word on each pledge) or may receive tarring and feathering (or rather a mock version using some glue) or branding.

Submission to senior members of the group is common. Abject &quot;etiquette&quot; required of pledges or subordinates may include prostration, kneeling, literal groveling, and kissing body parts.

Other physical feats may be required, such as calisthenics and other physical tests, such as mud wrestling, forming a human pyramid, or climbing a greased pole. Exposure to the elements may be required, such as swimming or diving in cold water or snow.

Orientation tests may be held, such as abandoning pledges without transport. Dares include jumping from some height, stealing from police or rival teams, and obedience. Blood pinning among military aviators (and many other elite groups) to celebrate becoming new pilots is done by piercing their chests with the sharp pins of aviator wings.

On a pilot&#x27;s first solo flight, they are often drenched with water and have the back of their shirt cut off to celebrate the achievement. Cutting off the back of the shirt originates from the days of tandem trainers, where the instructor sat behind the students and tugged on the back of their shirts to get their attention. Cutting off the back of the shirt symbolizes that the instructor does not need to do that anymore.

On their first &quot;crossing the equator&quot; in military and commercial navigation, each &quot;pollywog&quot; is subjected to a series of tests, usually including running or crawling a gauntlet of abuse and various scenes supposedly situated at King Neptune&#x27;s court. A &quot;pledge auction&quot; is a variation on the slave auction, where people bid on the paraded pledges.

Hazing also occurs for apprentices in some trades. In printing, it consists of applying bronze blue to the apprentice&#x27;s penis and testicles, a color made by mixing black printers ink and dark blue printers ink, which takes a long time to wash off. Similarly, mechanics get their groins smeared with old dirty grease.

==Psychology, sociology, purpose and effects==
=== Solidarity and group cohesion ===

One theory proposed to explain hazing behaviors is that it increases solidarity among a group&#x27;s inductees, between the inductees and existing members, or between new members and the group.

==== Laboratory studies ====

Attempts at replicating hazing in laboratory studies have yielded inconclusive results concerning group solidarity. A 1959 study by Aronson and Mills found that students made to read embarrassing material to join a discussion group reported liking the group more. On the other hand, a 1991 experiment by Hautaluoma et al. found that severe initiations could sometimes lead to lower liking for a group. Laboratory-based recreations of hazing may be limited in informativeness because they are only able to impose brief unpleasant experiences whose severity is limited by ethical restrictions on laboratory research. Real-world hazing may last months, may be far more severe, and may involve a confluence of different feelings, in contrast to the relatively simple distress induced in laboratory experiments. Researcher Aldo Cimino also points out that laboratory groups are &quot;ephemeral&quot;, whereas real-world organizations that engage in hazing are &quot;serious and enduring coalitions&quot;.

==== Naturalistic surveys and studies ====

Surveys and studies examining real-world hazing have also yielded inconclusive results about its impacts on group solidarity.

A 2022 study of new members of an American social fraternity that engaged in hazing found that hazing was &quot;not substantially related to feelings of solidarity&quot;.

A 2016 survey of members of sororities and fraternities in the Netherlands found that mentally severe, but not physically severe, initiation rituals were linked to lower affiliation with fellow inductees and that the humiliation experienced by inductees explained this relationship.

A 2007 survey of student-athletes conducted by Van Raalte &quot;et al.&quot; found that hazing was associated with lower task cohesion and had no apparent relation to social cohesion; by contrast, appropriate team building activities had a positive impact on social cohesion but had little impact on task cohesion. The study, which included activities like &quot;tattooing&quot; and &quot;engaging in or simulating sex acts&quot; as &quot;acceptable team building&quot; activities because respondents categorized them as appropriate, has been criticized for using an improper definition for hazing.

==== Views and theories ====

Citing the 1959 study by Aronson and Mills, Psychologist Robert Cialdini uses the framework of consistency and commitment to explain the phenomenon of hazing and the vigor and zeal to which practitioners of hazing persist in and defend these activities even when they are made illegal. The 1959 study shaped the development of cognitive dissonance theory by Leon Festinger.

Many people view hazing as an effective way to teach respect and develop discipline and loyalty within the group and believe that hazing is a necessary component of initiation rites. Hazing can be used as a way to engender conformity within a social group, something that can be seen in many sociological studies. Moreover, initiation rituals when managed effectively can serve to build team cohesion and improve team performance, while negative and detrimental forms of hazing alienate and disparage individuals.

Dissonance can produce feelings of group attraction or social identity among initiates after the hazing experience because they want to justify the effort used. Rewards during initiations or hazing rituals matter in that initiates who feel more rewarded express a stronger group identity. As well as increasing group attraction, hazing can produce conformity among new members. Hazing could also increase feelings of affiliation because of the stressful nature of the hazing experience. Also, hazing has a hard time of being extinguished by those who saw it to be potentially dangerous like administration in education or law enforcement.

A 2014 paper by Harvey Whitehouse discusses theories that hazing can cause social cohesion though group identification and identity fusion. A 2017 study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; found that groups that share painful or strong negative experiences can cause visceral bonding and pro-group behavior.

=== Dominance over new members ===

Another theory that seeks to explain hazing is that hazing activities allow senior members to exercise dominance and establish power over newer members.

Anthropologist Aldo Cimino notes that some elements of hazing are not entirely consistent with the theory that it is a pure display of dominance. Hazing occurs in a &quot;ceremonial or ritualistic&quot; context that creates a distinction between hazing activities and everyday life, which is inconsistent with a desire to set up a lasting dominance hierarchy. Newcomers also gain a far more egalitarian standing after hazing ends, showing that the dynamics that occur during hazing are &quot;profoundly exaggerated relative to the actual social hierarchy&quot;.

=== Selection ===

The theory of hazing as a selection mechanism posits that hazing seeks to eliminate prospective members who are not sufficiently committed to a group or who would otherwise be free riders.

Anthropologist Aldo Cimino notes that hazing ordeals can sometimes provide information about how a prospective member values a group by demonstrating the costs they are willing to endure. Cimino also notes, however, those common elements of hazing, such as disorientation and intimidation, may cause people to endure hazing rituals regardless of how much they value a group, and that hazing occurs even in situations in which less committed inductees are not free to leave, suggesting that selection may not fully explain hazing activities.

=== Protection from exploitation of automatic benefits ===
Aldo Cimino proposes that hazing is an evolutionarily-acquired behavior that specifically seeks to protect groups from the exploitation of &quot;automatic benefits&quot;—benefits that are automatically gained by being a member of the group—by newcomers.

== Prevention ==
=== Anti-hazing messaging ===
In the United States, universities and hazing-prevention organizations have published messages directed at students that seek to deter students from engaging in hazing activities. This includes messaging focused on the potential harms of hazing, the ineffectiveness of hazing for group bonding, and social norms statistics that show large majorities in opposition to hazing.

Hazing researcher Aldo Cimino has noted that the anti-hazing messaging released by institutions is sometimes inaccurate and that the ambiguous state of current research on hazing makes it difficult to accurately make strong claims about the effects of hazing activities of differing severities.

==Scope==

===United States===
According to one of the largest US National Surveys regarding hazing including over 60,000 student-athletes from 2,400 colleges and universities:

The survey found that 79% of college athletes experienced some form of hazing to join their team, yet 60% of the student-athlete respondents indicated that they would not report hazing incidents.

A 2007 survey at American colleges found that 55% of students in &quot;clubs, teams, and organizations&quot; experienced behavior the survey defined as hazing, including in varsity athletics and Greek-letter organizations. This survey found that 47% of respondents experienced hazing before college; in 25% of hazing cases, school staff were aware of the activity. 90% of students who experienced behavior the researchers defined as hazing did not consider themselves to have been hazed, and 95% of those who experienced what they defined as hazing did not report it. The most common hazing-related activities reported in student groups included alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts.

Police forces, especially those with a paramilitary tradition or sub-units of police forces such as tactical teams, may also have hazing rituals. Rescue services, such as lifeguards or air-sea rescue teams may have hazing rituals.

===Belgium===
In Belgium, hazing rituals are a common practice in student clubs (fraternities and sororities, called in Dutch and in French) and student societies (called , or in Dutch and or in French). The latter are typically attached to the faculty of the university. In contrast, the first ones are privately operated by hazing committees (, ), which are usually led by older students who have previously been hazed themselves. Hazing rituals in student societies have generally been safer than those in student clubs, precisely because they are to some extent regulated by universities.

For example, KU Leuven drew up a hazing charter in 2013 following an animal cruelty incident in the hazing ritual of student club Reuzegom. The charter was to be signed by student societies, fraternities, and sororities. Signing the charter would have been a pledge to notify the city of the place and time of the hazing ceremony and to abstain from violence, racism, extortion, bullying, sexual assault, discrimination, and the use of vertebrate animals. Reuzegom, as well as the other fraternities and sororities of the Antwerp Guild, refused. In 2018, twenty-year-old student Sanda Dia died from multiple organ failure in the Reuzegom hazing ritual as a result of abuse by fellow Reuzegom members. The killing of a black student in a mostly-white fraternity, some of whose members are alleged to have engaged in racist behaviour, led to controversy. , a few sororities have signed the charter, as well as all student societies. In April 2019, the 28 remaining fraternities in Leuven signed the charter.

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, the so-called &#x27;traditional fraternities&#x27; have an introduction time, including hazing rituals. The pledges go to a camp for a few days, during which they undergo hazing rituals. Meanwhile, they are introduced to the traditions of the fraternity. After camp, there are usually evenings or whole days when the pledges must be present at the fraternity. However, the pressure is released slowly, and the relations become somewhat more equal. Often, pledges collect or perform chores to raise funds for charity. At the end of the hazing period, the new members&#x27; inauguration occurs.

Incidents have occurred, resulting in injuries and death. Often, these incidents happen when members wish to join a house, (prestigious) sub-structure, or commission for which they undergo a second (and usually heavier) hazing ritual. Incidents mostly occur during hazing rituals for these sub-structures since there is less or no control from the fraternity board. Also, these sub-structure hazing rituals often involve excessive alcohol abuse, even when alcohol has become a taboo in the hazing of the fraternity itself. Other situations causing additional risks for incidents are members (often joining the hazing camp but not designated with any responsibility) separating pledges and taking them away from the main group to &#x27;amuse themselves&#x27; with them.

In 1965, a student at Utrecht University choked to death during a hazing ritual (&quot;Roetkapaffaire&quot;). There was public outrage when the perpetrators were convicted to light conditional sentences while left-wing Provo demonstrators were given unconditional prison sentences for order disturbances. The fact that the magistrates handling the case were all alumni of the same fraternity gave rise to accusations of nepotism and class justice. Two incidents in 1997, leading to one heavy injury and one death, led to sharpened scrutiny over hazing. Hazing incidents have nevertheless occurred since, but justice is becoming keener in persecuting perpetrators.

The Netherlands has no anti-hazing legislation. Hazing incidents can be handled by internal resolution by the fraternity itself (in the lightest cases) or via the criminal justice system as assault or, in case of death, negligent homicide or manslaughter. Universities generally support student unions (financially and by granting board members a discount on the required number of ECTS credits). Still, in the most extreme case, they can suspend or withdraw recognition and support for such unions.

===Philippines===
According to R. Dayao, hazing, usually in initiation rites of fraternities, has a long history in the Philippines and has been a source of public controversy after many cases that resulted in the death of the neophyte. The first recorded death due to hazing in the Philippines was recorded in 1954, with the death of Gonzalo Mariano Albert. Hazing was regulated under the Anti-Hazing Act of 1995 after the death of Leonardo Villa in 1991. Still, many cases, usually causing severe injury or death, continued even after it was enacted, the latest involving Darwin Dormitorio, a 20-year-old Cadet 4th Class from the Philippine Military Academy.

===Republic of Ireland===
Hazing incidents are rare in the Republic of Ireland but are known at certain elite educational institutions.

At Trinity College Dublin, an all-male society, Knights of the Campanile, was implicated in a hazing incident in 2019, where initiates were taunted, jeered at, told to get in a shower, insulted each other, and required to eat large amounts of butter. Campus newspaper &quot;The University Times&quot; was criticised for using secret recording devices to record the event. Dublin University Boat Club is also known for hazing, with rituals including consumption of alcohol, stripping to one&#x27;s underwear, caning with bamboo rods, push-ups, being shouted at, standing in the rain, being tied together by shoelaces and crawling a maze while being hit with pillows. Hazing is common at Trinity sports societies and teams. Zeta Psi fraternity has a presence at Trinity as well, and some hazing has been reported.

Hazing also took place at Dublin City University&#x27;s Accounting &amp; Finance Society in 2018, where first-years standing for committee positions had to complete a variety of sexualized games. The club was suspended for a year as a result.

A report on Gaelic games county players noted that 6% of players reported were aware of forced binge drinking as a form of hazing.

===Ragging in South Asia===

Ragging is similar to hazing in educational institutions in the Indian subcontinent. The word is mainly used in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Ragging involves existing students baiting or bullying new students. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to psychological or physical torture.

In 2009, the University Grants Commission of India imposed regulations upon Indian universities to help curb ragging. It launched a toll-free &#x27;anti-ragging helpline&#x27;. The effectiveness of these measures are unknown; many accused of ragging first-year students are either let out with a warning or saved from legal action by political or caste lobbyists.

Although ragging is a criminal offense in Sri Lanka under the Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998, and carries a severe punishment, several variations of ragging can be observed in universities around the country. Through the years, this practice has worsened all types of violence, including sexual violence and harassment, and has also claimed the lives of several students. The university grants commission of Sri Lanka, have set up several pathways to report ragging incidents, including a special office, helpline and a mobile app where students can make a complaint anonymously or seek help.

==Controversy==

The practice of ritual abuse among social groups is not clearly understood. This is partly due to the secretive nature of the activities, especially within collegiate fraternities and sororities, and partly due to the long-term acceptance of hazing. Thus, it has been difficult for researchers to agree on the underlying social and psychological mechanisms perpetuating hazing. In military circles, hazing is sometimes assumed to test recruits under situations of stress and hostility. Although in no way a recreation of combat, hazing does put people into stressful situations that they are unable to control, which allegedly should weed out the weaker members before being placed in situations where failure to perform will cost lives. A portion of the military training course known as Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) simulates as closely as is feasible the physical and psychological conditions of a POW camp.

According to opponents, the problem with this approach is that the stress and hostility come from &quot;inside&quot; the group and not from &quot;outside&quot; as in actual combat situations, creating suspicion and distrust towards the superiors and comrades-in-arms. Willing participants may be motivated by a desire to prove to senior soldiers their stability in future combat situations, making the unit more secure. Still, blatantly brutal hazing can produce negative results, making the units more prone to break, desert, or mutiny than those without hazing traditions, as observed in the Russian army in Chechnya, where units with the strongest traditions of were the first to break and desert under enemy fire. At worst, hazing may lead into fragging incidents. Colleges and universities sometimes avoid publicizing hazing incidents for fear of damaging institutional reputations or incurring financial liability to victims.

In a 1999 study, a survey of 3,293 collegiate athletes, coaches, athletic directors, and deans found a variety of approaches to prevent hazing, including strong disciplinary and corrective measures for known cases, implementation of athletic, behavioral, and academic standards guiding recruitment; provisions for alternative bonding and recognition events for teams to prevent hazing; and law enforcement involvement in monitoring, investigating, and prosecuting hazing incidents. Hoover&#x27;s research suggested half of all college athletes are involved in alcohol-related hazing incidents, while one in five is involved in potentially illegal hazing incidents. Only another one in five was involved in what Hoover described as positive initiation events, such as taking team trips or running obstacle courses.

Hoover wrote: &quot;Athletes most at risk for any kind of hazing for college sports were men; non-Greek members; and either swimmers, divers, soccer players, or lacrosse players. The campuses where hazing was most likely to occur were primarily in eastern or southern states with no anti-hazing laws. The campuses were rural, residential, and had Greek systems.&quot; (Hoover uses the term &quot;Greek&quot; to refer to U.S.-style fraternities and sororities.) Hoover found that non-fraternity members were most at risk of hazing and that football players were most at risk of potentially dangerous or illegal hazing. In the May issue of the &quot;American Journal of Emergency Medicine&quot;, Michelle Finkel reported that hazing injuries are often not recognized for their actual cause in emergency medical centers. The doctor said hazing victims sometimes hide the real cause of injuries out of shame or to protect those who caused the harm. In protecting their abusers, hazing victims can be compared with victims of domestic violence, Finkel wrote.

Finkel cites hazing incidents including &quot;beating or kicking to the point of traumatic injury or death, burning or branding, excessive calisthenics, being forced to eat unpleasant substances and psychological or sexual abuse of both males and females&quot;. Reported coerced sexual activity is sometimes considered &quot;horseplay&quot; rather than rape, she wrote. Finkel quoted from Hank Nuwer&#x27;s book &quot;Wrongs of Passage&quot;, which counted 56 hazing deaths between 1970 and 1999.

In November 2005, controversy arose over a video showing Royal Marines fighting naked and intoxicated as part of a hazing ritual. The fight culminated with one soldier receiving a kick to the face, rendering him unconscious. The victim, according to the BBC, said &quot;It&#x27;s just Marine humour&quot;. The Marine who leaked the video said &quot;The guy laid out was inches from being dead.&quot; Under further investigation, the Marines had just returned from a six-month tour of Iraq and were in their &quot;cooling down&quot; period, in which they spend two weeks at a naval base before they are allowed back into society. The man who suffered the kick to the head did not press charges.

In 2008, Dr. Elizabeth Allan and Dr. Mary Madden from the University of Maine conducted a national hazing study. This investigation is the most comprehensive study of hazing to date. It includes responses from more than 11,000 undergraduate students at 53 colleges and universities in different regions of the United States and interviews with more than 300 students and staff at 18 of these campuses. Through the vision and efforts of many, this study fills a significant gap in the research and extends the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding about hazing. Ten initial findings are described in the report, &quot;Hazing in View: College Students at Risk&quot;. These include:
# More than half of college students in clubs, teams, and organizations experience hazing.
# Nearly half (47%) of students have experienced hazing before coming to college.
# Alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts are hazing practices common across student groups.

==Hazing incidents at European universities==
*1495: Leipzig University banned the hazing of freshmen by other students: &quot;Statute Forbidding Any One to Annoy or Unduly Injure the Freshmen. Each and every one attached to this university is forbidden to offend with insult, torment, harass, drench with water or urine, throw on or defile with dust or any filth, mock by whistling, cry at them with a terrifying voice, or dare to molest in any way whatsoever physically or severely, any, who are called freshmen, in the market, streets, courts, colleges and living houses, or any place whatsoever, and particularly in the present college, when they have entered to matriculate or are leaving after matriculation.&quot;
*1997: During the hazing period of a Dutch fraternity, a pledge was run over by members when he was sleeping drunk in the grass. A few weeks later, a pledge, Reinout Pfeiffer, died after drinking a large quantity of jenever as part of an initiation ritual for his student house attached to the same fraternity. These incidents prompted Dutch fraternities to regulate their hazing rituals more strictly.
*2005: A few months later, in May 2005, a Dutch student almost died from water intoxication after participating in a hazing drinking game in which the liquor was replaced by water.
*2005: The victim of a high-profile hazing attack in Russia, Andrey Sychyov, required the amputation of his legs and genitalia after he was forced to squat for four hours whilst being beaten and tortured by a military group on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2005. President Vladimir Putin spoke out about the incident and ordered Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov &quot;to submit proposals on legal and organizational matters to improve educational work in the army and navy&quot;.
*2010: In a hazing incident in the Netherlands, pledges were asked to &#x27;baffle the members&#x27; with a stunt. They decided to do so by dressing one of them in a Sinterklaas costume, dousing the suit in lamp oil, and setting it on fire. The victim jumped in the water in his burning costume and suffered second-degree burns, needing medical treatment. The student who set the victim&#x27;s costume on fire was sentenced to 50 hours of unpaid work.
*2016: In August 2016, a student in a Dutch fraternity suffered serious head injuries after a member forced him to lie on the floor, placed his foot on his head, and exercised pressure on the skull. The perpetrator was convicted to a prison sentence of 31 days (of which 30 days were conditional), 240 hours of unpaid labor, and €5,066.80 damage compensation to the victim. The perpetrator appealed against this verdict, after which it was reduced in appeal to a fine of €1,000.
*2016: In December 2016, Newcastle University student Ed Farmer, 20, died from a cardiac arrest and immense brain damage after an initiation ceremony into the Agricultural Society. Events included head shaving, being sprayed with paint used to mark stock, drinking vodka from a pig&#x27;s head, and bobbing for apples in a mixture of urine and alcohol. Farmer was known to have drunk 27 vodka shots in three hours. Initiation ceremonies have been strictly banned by the university.
*2018: Three Flemish Belgian students, from the KU Leuven were hospitalized after consuming a large amount of fish sauce as part of a hazing ritual. One slipped into a coma and died, likely due to a combination of the high concentration of salt in the sauce and hypothermia.

==Hazing deaths at Asian universities==

*1993–2007: In Indonesia, 35 people died as a result of hazing initiation rites in the Institute of Public Service (IPDN). The most recent was in April 2007 when Cliff Muntu died after being beaten by the seniors.
*1997: Selvanayagam Varapragash, a first-year engineering student at University of Peradeniya, was murdered on the campus due to hazing. He was subjected to sadistic ragging, and in a post-mortem examination, a large quantity of toothpaste was found in his rectum.
*2002: Rupa Rathnaseeli, a 22-year-old student of the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, became paralyzed as a result of jumping from the second floor of the hostel &quot;Ramanathan Hall&quot; to escape the physical ragging carried out by older students. It was reported that she was about to have a candle inserted into her vagina just before she jumped out of the hostel building. She committed suicide in 2002.
*2007: On June 26 at the Tokitsukaze stable, 17-year-old sumo wrestler Takashi Saito was beaten to death by his fellow rikishi with a beer bottle and metal baseball bat at the direction of his trainer, Jun&#x27;ichi Yamamoto. Though Saito&#x27;s cause of death was originally reported as heart failure, his father demanded an autopsy, which uncovered evidence of the beating. Both Yamamoto and the other rikishi were charged with manslaughter.

==Notable examples in the USA==
These examples are limited to incidents in the USA which did not lead to death. 
*1684: Cambridge, Massachusetts, a Harvard University Student, Joseph Webb, was expelled for hazing.
*1873: A &quot;New York Times&quot; headline read: &quot;West Point. &#x27;Hazing&#x27; at the Academy – An Evil That Should be Entirely Rooted Out&quot;
*1900: Oscar Booz began at West Point in June 1898 in good physical health. Four months later, he resigned due to health problems. He died in December 1900 of tuberculosis. During his long struggle with the illness, he blamed the illness on hazing he received at West Point in 1898, claiming he had hot sauce poured down his throat on three occasions as well as several other grueling hazing practices, such as brutal beatings and having hot wax poured on him in the night. His family claimed that scarring from the hot sauce made him more susceptible to the infection, causing his death. Among other things, Booz claimed that his devotion to Christianity made him a target and that he was tormented for reading his Bible.
:The practice of hazing at West Point entered the national spotlight following his death. Congressional hearings investigated his death and the pattern of systemic hazing of first-year students, and serious efforts were made to reform the system and end hazing at West Point.
*1903: Three young boys in Vermont, aged 11, 10, and 7, read about hazing practices in college and decided to try it themselves. They built a fire in a pasture behind the schoolhouse, leading 9-year-old Ralph Canning to the spot. They heated several stones until they were red hot. The boys forced Canning to both sit and stand on the hot stones and held him there despite his screams. The boys then either walked or jumped on him (depending on the source). He was finally allowed to leave, and he crawled home, where he died two weeks later. The public was stunned by the young age of the perpetrators.
*1967: Delta Kappa Epsilon, Yale University. Future US president George W. Bush (who at the time was president of the fraternity) was implicated in a scandal where members of the DKE fraternity were accused of branding triangles onto the lower back of pledges. Mr. Bush is quoted as dismissing the injuries as &quot;only a cigarette burn&quot;. The fraternity received a fine for their behavior.
*2004: In Sandwich, Massachusetts, nine high school football players faced felony charges after a freshman teammate lost his spleen in a hazing ritual.
*2011: Two Andover High School basketball players were expelled, and five were suspended for pressuring first- and second-year students to play &quot;wet biscuit&quot;, where the loser was forced to eat a semen-soaked cookie.
*2011: Thirteen students from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University attacked drum major Robert Champion on a bus after a marching band performance, beating him to death. Since the 2011 death, a series of reports of abuse and hazing within the band have been documented. In May 2012, two faculty members resigned in connection with a hazing investigation, and 13 people were charged with felony or misdemeanor hazing crimes. Eleven of those individuals faced one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death, which is punishable by up to six years in prison. The FAMU incident prompted Florida Governor Rick Scott to order all state universities to examine their hazing and harassment policies in December. Scott also asked all university presidents to remind their students, faculty and staff &quot;how detrimental hazing can be&quot;.
*2013: Tyler Lawrence, a student at Wilmington College (Ohio), lost a testicle as a result of hazing after being forced to lie down nude on a basement floor wet with three inches of water, stuffed with hamburgers, then ball-gagged, and finally being hit in his scrotum with towels and shirts that were tied with balled ends or other objects. Despite being painfully injured, he was then forced to sit up and swallow vinegar-soaked bananas.
*2014: Seven members of the Sayreville War Memorial High School football team in Sayreville, New Jersey, were arrested and charged with sexual assaults on younger players. &quot;In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen. Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet&quot; and sexually abused. Six of the team members were sentenced for lesser crimes, and the seventh case was still pending in 2016.
*2015: Western Kentucky University swim team hazing scandal – After investigations revealed several incidents of hazing within the swimming and diving program at Western Kentucky University, the university placed the entire program on a five-year suspension. As of 2024, the program has yet to be revived.
*2021: Danny Santulli was made to guzzle 1.75 liters of vodka at a University of Missouri fraternity. He was 18 at the time. The incident left him with severe brain damage, complete loss of eyesight, and unable to walk or communicate in any way.
*2023: The coach of the Northwestern University football team was fired after allegations surfaced of physically and sexually abusive hazing on the team.

<doc id="441207" wikidata="Q7270153" url="?curid=441207" title="King-in-Parliament">
<text>In the Westminster system used in many Commonwealth realms, the King-in-Parliament (Queen-in-Parliament during the reign of a queen) is a constitutional law concept that refers to the components of parliament – the sovereign (or vice-regal representative) and the legislative houses – acting together to enact legislation.

Parliamentary sovereignty is a concept in the constitutional law of Westminster systems that holds that parliament has absolute sovereignty and is supreme over all other government institutions. The King-in-Parliament as a composite body (that is, parliament) exercises this legislative authority.

Bills passed by the houses are sent to the sovereign or their representative (such as the governor-general, lieutenant-governor, or governor), for royal assent in order to enact them into law as acts of Parliament. An Act may also provide for secondary legislation, which can be made by executive officers of the Crown such as through an order in council.

==Fusion of powers==

The concept of the Crown as a part of parliament is related to the idea of the fusion of powers, meaning that the executive branch and legislative branch of government are fused together. This is a key concept of the Westminster system of government, developed in England and used in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and beyond. It is in contradistinction to the idea of the separation of powers.

In Commonwealth realms that are federations, the concept of the King in parliament applies within that specific parliament only, as each sub-national parliament is considered separate and distinct from each other and from the federal parliaments (such as Australian states or the Canadian provinces).

==United Kingdom==
According to constitutional scholar A.V. Dicey, &quot;Parliament means, in the mouth of a lawyer (though the word has often a different sense in ordinary conversation), the King, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons; these three bodies acting together may be aptly described as the &#x27;King in Parliament,&#x27; and constitute Parliament.&quot; Legal philosopher H. L. A. Hart wrote that the Queen-in-Parliament is “considered as a single continuing legislative entity”.

Constitutional scholar Ivor Jennings described the Queen-in-Parliament as &quot;a purely formal body consisting of the Queen sitting on her Throne with the Lords of Parliament sitting before her and the Commons standing at the Bar.&quot; This formal gathering was historically the only process by which legislation could be enacted. The Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541 allowed Lords Commissioners to stand in for the monarch, and the Royal Assent Act 1967 allowed legislation to be enacted by pronunciation, without a physical gathering. The assembling of the King, Lords, and Commons as the King-in-Parliament is now &quot;notional rather than real&quot;, only occurring ceremonially at the annual State Opening of Parliament.

The composition of the King-in-Parliament is reflected in the enacting clause of acts of the British Parliament with: &quot; by the King&#x27;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...&quot;.

===Development of parliamentary sovereignty===

In England, by the mid-16th century, it was established that the &quot;King in Parliament&quot; held supreme legislative authority. However, this phrase was subject to two competing theories of interpretation. The Royalist view interpreted the phrase as &quot;King, in Parliament&quot;; that is, the King acting with the consent of the Lords and Commons, but ultimately exercising his own sovereign authority. The Parliamentarian view was that legislative authority was exercised by the &quot;King-in-Parliament”, a composite institution of the King, Lords, and Commons acting together.

As described by Jeffrey Goldsworthy, &quot;The question that divided them was whether [the] final, unchallengeable decision-maker was the king alone, or the King, Lords, and Commons in parliament.&quot; The dispute had implications for the ability of Parliament to limit the monarch’s powers, or &quot;the supremacy of the King in Parliament over the King out of Parliament.&quot; The clash between the Royalist and Parliamentarian views continued through the 16th century and much of the 17th, and was a factor in the English Civil War (1642-1651) and the execution of Charles I (1649).

The Parliamentarian position ultimately prevailed with the Glorious Revolution (1688–89) and subsequent passing of the Bill of Rights 1689, which significantly limited the day-to-day powers of the monarch, including removing prerogative powers to unilaterally suspend or dispense with statutes.

===Balance of power within the King-in-Parliament===

The concept of the King-in-Parliament holding supreme legislative authority is a core tenet of the Constitution of the United Kingdom and has application in the Westminster system more generally. As a concept, legislative authority being exercised by the King-in-Parliament is compatible with different distributions of power among its three components. This allowed for increasing limitations on the monarch’s direct and unilateral influence within Parliament over the 18th and 19th centuries. The influence of the House of Lords has also been significantly limited, most notably by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, which allow money bills to be passed against the wishes of the House of Lords. Such legislation can still be understood in a constitutional sense to be an act of the King-in-Parliament, that is by the King, Lords, and Commons acting jointly as a single body known as parliament.

===Rules and procedures===
In order to act as the King-in-Parliament, the individual components must act according to their established rules and procedures. The individuals involved must be &quot;constituted as a public institution qua Parliament (on the basis of some rules and under certain circumstances)&quot; in order to &quot;[enjoy] the power to legislate as &#x27;the [King] in Parliament&#x27; i.e., the ultimate legislature.&quot; This creates a potential paradox when determining Parliament’s ability to modify its own rules or composition.

==Canada==

Section 17 of Canada&#x27;s Constitution Act, 1867 establishes the Parliament of Canada as the legislative authority for the country, defining it as consisting of &quot;the Queen [or King], an Upper House styled the Senate, and the House of Commons.&quot; The Parliament of Canada may be referred to as the King-in-Parliament, and its three-part composition is based on &quot;the British model of legislative sovereignty vesting in the [King]-in-Parliament&quot;. Canadian acts of Parliament use the enacting clause: &quot;, His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows...&quot;

Canada&#x27;s provincial legislatures are constitutionally defined as consisting of the province&#x27;s lieutenant governor (as the representative of the King) and a popularly elected legislative assembly. The concept of King-in-Parliament also applies to these sub-national legislatures.

Legal scholar Paul McHugh describes Canada as having &quot;a crisis of constitutional identity&quot; in the later 20th century, finding &quot;the old Whig narrative of an absolute sovereign self (the Crown in Parliament)&quot; to be inadequate. The Canadian response was to &quot;not seek to refurbish a historical order so much as to fundamentally reorder it by adopting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms limiting the power of government, the Crown in Parliament (federal and provincial) included.&quot;

==New Zealand==
The New Zealand Parliament consists of the King and the New Zealand House of Representatives.

McHugh describes New Zealand, like Canada, as finding the concept of Crown in Parliament (as it had previously been conceived) to be inadequate in the late 20th century. Contrasted with Canada&#x27;s approach, New Zealand&#x27;s response was, to &quot;[reconstitute] that Parliament on an electoral model of proportional representation.&quot;

<doc id="441208" wikidata="Q6120233" url="?curid=441208" title="Rugby shirt">
<text>A rugby shirt, also known as a jersey or jumper, is worn by players of rugby union or rugby league. It usually has short sleeves, though long sleeves are common as well.

Traditionally, rugby shirts have had a buttoned opening at the top, in a similar style to polo shirts but with a stiffer collar. However, modern rugby shirts often have a very small collar, or none at all, so as to provide less material for a potential tackler to latch onto (even though such an action is illegal during a game). Due to the nature of the game, the fabric is generally strong, and traditionally rugby shirts have rubber buttons so that they would, if pulled on in a game, come undone rather than pop off. 

A traditional design of rugby shirt consists of five or six horizontal stripes or &quot;hoops&quot; in alternating colours. Rugby league shirts often have a large &#x27;V&#x27; around the neck as part of their design. Rugby shirts, like most sport shirts, will usually have a number on the back, though shirts not meant for competitive play will usually forgo this. Logos and labels of sponsorship are now common, and generally appear on the abdominal area of the shirt.

== Materials ==

Rugby shirts were traditionally made out of cotton, but as synthetic fabrics became cheaper and more durable they have become incorporated into rugby shirts. The two most common materials are a mix between cotton and polyester (many of these shirts are meant for supporter use, though they can be used in a rugby game), and pure polyester (these shirts are generally designed specifically for game use by players). Most modern playing jerseys have a tight-fitting athletic cut, as opposed to the looser cut of the traditional cotton based jerseys. 

The reason for the preference of polyester in a game situation is twofold: firstly, polyester is harder to get hold of in a tackle situation, as it is inherently more &#x27;slippery&#x27; than cotton or a cotton-blend. In addition, the increasing use of skin-tight shirts further enhances this effect, as there is no loose material for a tackler to get a grip of. Other benefits of man-made fibre over cotton is that it absorbs less water and mud, and it can accentuate the muscular physique of players. 

The gaining popularity of rugby sevens has made more of a demand for lighter, more breathable jerseys as well. Rugby sevens is a faster, more wide open game in which players compete 7 versus 7 as opposed to 15 versus 15.

The rugby shirt has, in some cultures, become a popular fashion item, with many clothing manufacturers producing rugby styled shirts, with the distinctive collar and hooped or squared design, which do not represent any actual club.

<doc id="441212" wikidata="Q131108" url="?curid=441212" title="Prime meridian (Greenwich)">
<text>The Greenwich meridian is a prime meridian, a geographical reference line that passes through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in London, England. From 1884 to 1974, the Greenwich meridian was the international standard prime meridian, used worldwide for timekeeping and navigation. The modern standard, the IERS Reference Meridian, is based on the Greenwich meridian, but differs slightly from it. This prime meridian (at the time, one of many) was first established by Sir George Airy (in 1851). In 1883, the International Geodetic Association formally recommended to governments that the meridian through Greenwich be adopted as the international standard prime meridian. In October of the following year, at the invitation of the President of the United States, 41 delegates from 25 nations met in Washington, D.C., United States, for the International Meridian Conference. This inter-governmental conference selected the meridian passing through Greenwich as the world standard prime meridian. However, France abstained from the vote, and French maps continued to use the Paris meridian for several decades. In the 18th century, London lexicographer Malachy Postlethwayt published his African maps showing the &quot;Meridian of London&quot; intersecting the Equator a few degrees west of the later meridian and Accra, Ghana.

The plane of the prime meridian contains the local gravity vector at the Airy transit circle instrument () of the Greenwich observatory. The prime meridian was therefore long symbolised by a brass strip in the courtyard, now replaced by stainless steel, and since 16 December 1999, it has been marked by a powerful green laser shining north across the London night sky.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers show that the marking strip for the prime meridian at Greenwich is not exactly at zero longitude (zero degrees, zero minutes, and zero seconds) but at approximately 5.3 seconds of arc to the west of the meridian, meaning that the meridian appears to be 102 metres east. In the past, this offset has been attributed to the establishment of reference meridians for space-based location systems such as WGS-84 (which the GPS relies on) or to the fact that errors gradually crept into the International Time Bureau timekeeping process. The actual reason for the discrepancy is that the difference between geodetic coordinates and astronomically determined coordinates everywhere remains a localized gravity effect due to vertical deflection; thus, no systematic rotation of global longitudes occurred between the former astronomical system and the current geodetic system.

==History==
Before the establishment of a common international prime meridian, most maritime countries established their own prime meridians, usually passing through the national observatory or other landmark in the country in question. In January 1851, the Royal Observatory at Greenwich established the prime meridian for Great Britain. 

In the 19th century, astronomers and geodesists were concerned with questions of longitude and time, because they were responsible for determining them scientifically and used them continually in their studies. The International Geodetic Association, which had covered Europe with a network of fundamental longitudes, took an interest in the question of an internationally-accepted prime meridian at its seventh general conference in Rome in 1883. Indeed, the Association was already providing administrations with the bases for topographical surveys, and engineers with the fundamental benchmarks for their levelling. It seemed natural that it should contribute to the achievement of significant progress in navigation, cartography and geography, as well as in the service of major communications institutions, railways and telegraphs. From a scientific point of view, to be a candidate for the status of international prime meridian, the proponent needed to satisfy three important criteria. According to the report by Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero, it must have a first-rate astronomical observatory, be directly linked by astronomical observations to other nearby observatories, and be attached to a network of first-rate triangles in the surrounding country. Four major observatories could satisfy these requirements: Greenwich, Paris, Berlin and Washington. The conference concluded that Greenwich Observatory best corresponded to the geographical, nautical, astronomical and cartographic conditions that guided the choice of an international prime meridian, and recommended the governments should adopt it as the world standard. The Conference further hoped that, if the whole world agreed on the unification of longitudes and times by the Association&#x27;s choosing the Greenwich meridian, Great Britain might respond in favour of the unification of weights and measures, by adhering to the Metre Convention.

In 1884, the International Meridian Conference (of government representatives) took place in Washington, D.C. to establish an internationally-recognised single meridian. The meridian chosen was that which passed through the Airy transit circle at Greenwich, and it became the prime meridian of the world for a century. In 1984 it was superseded in that role by the IERS Reference Meridian which, at this latitude, runs about 102 metres to the east of the Greenwich meridian.

At around the time of the 1884 conference, scientists were making measurements to determine the deflection of the vertical on a large scale. One might expect that plumb lines set up in various locations, if extended downward, would all pass through a single point, the centre of Earth, but this is not the case, primarily due to Earth being an ellipsoid, not a sphere. The downward extended plumb lines don&#x27;t even all intersect the rotation axis of Earth; this much smaller effect is due to the uneven distribution of Earth&#x27;s mass. To make computations feasible, scientists defined ellipsoids of revolution, more closely emulating the shape of Earth, modified for a particular zone; a published ellipsoid would be a good base line for measurements. The difference between the direction of a plumb line or vertical, and a line perpendicular to the surface of the ellipsoid of revolution a &quot;normal&quot; to said ellipsoid at a particular observatory, is the deflection of the vertical.

==IERS Reference Meridian==

When the Airy transit circle was built, a mercury basin was used to align the telescope to the perpendicular. Thus the circle was aligned with the local vertical or plumb line, which is deflected slightly from the normal, or line perpendicular, to the reference ellipsoid used to define geodetic latitude and longitude in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (which is nearly the same as the WGS84 system used by the GPS). While Airy&#x27;s local vertical, set by the &quot;apparent&quot; centre of gravity of Earth still points to (aligns with) the modern celestial meridian (the intersection of the prime meridian plane with the celestial sphere), it does not pass through Earth&#x27;s rotation axis. As a result of this, the ITRF zero meridian, defined by a plane passing through Earth&#x27;s rotation axis, is 102.478 metres to the east of the prime meridian. A 2015 analysis by Malys &quot;et al.&quot; shows the offset between the former and the latter can be explained by this deflection of the vertical alone; other possible sources of the offset that have been proposed in the past are smaller than the current uncertainty in the deflection of the vertical, locally. The astronomical longitude of the Greenwich prime meridian was found to be 0.19 ± 0.47 E, i.e. the plane defined by the local vertical on the Greenwich prime meridian and the plane passing through Earth&#x27;s rotation axis on the ITRF zero meridian are effectively parallel. Claims, such as that on the BBC website, that the gap between astronomical and geodetic coordinates means that &quot;any&quot; measurements of transit time across the IRTF zero meridian will occur precisely 0.352 seconds (or 0.353 sidereal seconds) before the transit across the &quot;intended meridian&quot; are based on a failure of understanding. The explanation by Malys &quot;et al&quot;. on the other hand is more studied and correct.

==Meridian today==
The Greenwich meridian passes through eight countries in Europe and Africa from north to south:

# United Kingdom (specifically, only England)
# France
# Spain 
# Algeria
# Mali
# Burkina Faso
# Togo
# Ghana

It also passes through Antarctica, only touching Queen Maud Land, a territorial claim of Norway, on its way from the North Pole to the South Pole.

It crosses the maritime exclusive economic zones of:

# Greenland (Denmark)
# Norway (via proximity to Svalbard, Jan Mayen Island, and the Norwegian mainland in the North Atlantic, and Bouvet Island in the South Atlantic)

<text>Carole Montillet-Carles (born 7 April 1973) is a French World Cup alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist.

==Career==
Born in Corrençon-en-Vercors, Isère, she became a member of the Villard-de-Lans ski club in Grenoble. At her Olympic debut in 1998 at Nagano, Japan, she finished 14th in both the super-G and downhill.

In January 2002, Montillet was chosen by the Comité National Olympique et Sportif Français to be the flag bearer at Salt Lake City. Her victory in the downhill days later was her first major triumph and the first alpine gold medal by a Frenchwoman since Marielle Goitschel&#x27;s slalom gold in Grenoble in 1968. She dedicated the win to her late teammate Régine Cavagnoud, the reigning world champion in super-G, who died after a training accident less than four months earlier.

Montillet&#x27;s achievements were more remarkable because she has suffered multiple serious injuries early in her career, such as torn knee ligaments.

While training for the downhill at the 2006 Winter Olympics, Montillet-Carles crashed on 13 February and was evacuated by helicopter to a nearby hospital. She suffered rib, back, and facial injuries, but still opted to defend her title two days later, but finished 28th. Several racers had complained that the downhill course was too easy, and Olympic organizers had made several changes to it. She finished fifth in the super-G five days later, then retired from competition at the end of the World Cup season.

<text>The 5th Armored Division (&quot;Victory&quot;) was an armored formation of the United States Army active from 1941 to 1945 and from 1950 to 1956.

==History==
The 5th Armored &quot;Victory&quot; Division was activated on 10 October 1941, and reached the United Kingdom in February 1944.

===Combat chronicle===

The division landed at Utah Beach on 24 July 1944 under the command of Major General Lunsford E. Oliver, and moved into combat on 2 August, driving south through Coutances, Avranches, and Vitré, and across the Mayenne River to seize the city of Le Mans, 8 August. Turning north, the division surrounded the Germans in Normandy by advancing, through Le Mêle-sur-Sarthe liberated on 11 August, to the edge of the city of Argentan on 12 August—8 days before the Argentan-Falaise Gap was closed.

Turning Argentan over to the 90th Infantry Division, the 5th Armored advanced 80 miles to capture the Eure River Line at Dreux on 16 August. Bitter fighting was encountered in clearing the Eure-Seine corridor, the second big trap in France. The 5th passed through Paris 30 August to spearhead V Corps drive through the Compiègne Forest, across the Oise, Aisne, and Somme Rivers, and reached the Belgian border at Condé, 2 September.

The division then turned east, advancing 100 miles in 8 hours, and crossed the Meuse at Charleville-Mézières, 4 September. Racing past Sedan, it liberated Luxembourg City on the 10th and deployed along the German border. The reconnaissance squadron of the division sent a patrol across the German border on the afternoon of 11 September to be the first of the Allies to cross the enemy frontier. On 14 September, the 5th penetrated the Siegfried Line at Wallendorf, remaining until the 20th, to draw off enemy reserves from Aachen.

In October it held defensive positions in the Monschau-Hofen sector. The division entered the Hurtgen Forest area in late November and pushed the enemy back to the banks of the Roer River in very heavy fighting. On 22 December it was withdrawn to Verviers and placed in 12th Army Group reserve.

Crossing the Roer on 25 February 1945 the 5th spearheaded the XIII Corps drive to the Rhine, crossing the Rhine at Wesel, 30 March. The Division reached the banks of the Elbe at Tangermunde, 12 April—45 miles from Berlin. On 16 April, the 5th moved to Klotze to wipe out the Von Clausewitz Panzer Division and again drove to the Elbe, this time in the vicinity of Dannenberg. The division mopped up in the Ninth Army sector until VE-day.

<text>Hanns Elard Ludin (10 June 1905, in Freiburg – 9 December 1947, in Bratislava) was a German diplomat.

Born in Freiburg to Friedrich and Johanna Ludin, Ludin started his Nazi affiliation in 1930 by joining the Nazi Party, and was arrested for his political activities the same year. He was one of the three defendants in the Ulm Reichswehr trial, in which he and two other Reichswehr officers were tried for attempting to form a Nazi cell within the Reichswehr in Ulm. The officers were accused of infiltrating the Reichswehr with the intent to start a Nazi revolution. In October 1930, all three men were found guilty &quot;preparation of high treason&quot; and each sentenced to 18 months in prison. Imprisoned until June 1931, Ludin joined the SA on his release.

Ludin restored his reputation by joining the Foreign Office and became Ambassador to the Slovak Republic in 1941, replacing Manfred von Killinger.

Ludin&#x27;s activities included convincing the Slovak government to comply with deportations for slave labor and providing diplomatic cover to such activities. In 1943, he was promoted to &quot;SA-Obergruppenführer&quot;.

Ludin was arrested after the war and extradited to Czechoslovakia, where he was tried with &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Hermann Höfle (not to be confused with &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Hermann Julius Höfle). He was sentenced to death and was hanged on 9 December 1947.

Married to Erla von Jordan (1905 – 1997), Ludin had six children: Erika (1933 – 1997), Barbara (born 1935), Ellen (born 1937), Tilman (1939 – 1999), Malte (born 1942) and Andrea (born 1943).

== Documentary film ==
Hanns Ludin&#x27;s youngest son, Malte Ludin, filmed a documentary about the impact of his father&#x27;s involvement in the Third Reich on his family. The film, &quot;2 oder 3 Dinge, die ich von ihm weiß&quot;, had its initial release in 2005. The movie&#x27;s commercial run in New York City began on 24 January 2007 at the Film Forum.

<doc id="441228" wikidata="Q1187365" url="?curid=441228" title="Electrical synapse">
<text>An electrical synapse, or gap junction, is a mechanical and electrically conductive synapse, a functional junction between two neighboring neurons. The synapse is formed at a narrow gap between the pre- and postsynaptic neurons known as a gap junction. At gap junctions, such cells approach within about 3.8 nm of each other, a much shorter distance than the 20- to 40-nanometer distance that separates cells at a chemical synapse. In many animals, electrical synapse-based systems co-exist with chemical synapses.

Compared to chemical synapses, electrical synapses conduct nerve impulses faster and provide continuous-time bidirectional coupling via linked cytoplasm. As such, the notion of signal directionality across these synapses is not always defined. They are known to produce synchronization of network activity in the brain and can create chaotic network level dynamics. In situations where a signal direction can be defined, they lack gain (unlike chemical synapses)—the signal in the postsynaptic neuron is the same or smaller than that of the originating neuron . The fundamental bases for perceiving electrical synapses comes down to the connexons that are located in the gap junction between two neurons. Electrical synapses are often found in neural systems that require the fastest possible response, such as defensive reflexes. An important characteristic of electrical synapses is that they are mostly bidirectional, allowing impulse transmission in either direction.

==Structure==
Each gap junction (sometimes called a &quot;nexus&quot;) contains numerous gap junction channels that cross the plasma membranes of both cells. With a lumen diameter of about 1.2 to 2.0 nm, the pore of a gap junction channel is wide enough to allow ions and even medium-size molecules like signaling molecules to flow from one cell to the next, thereby connecting the two cells&#x27; cytoplasm. Thus when the membrane potential of one cell changes, ions may move through from one cell to the next, carrying positive charge with them and depolarizing the postsynaptic cell.

Gap junction channels are composed of two hemichannels called connexons in vertebrates, one contributed by each cell at the synapse. Connexons are formed by six 7.5 nm long, four-pass membrane-spanning protein subunits called connexins, which may be identical or slightly different from one another.

An autapse is an electrical (or chemical) synapse formed when the axon of one neuron synapses with its own dendrites.

==Effects==
They are found in many regions in animal and human body. The simplicity of electrical synapses results in synapses that are fast, but more importantly the bidirectional coupling can produce very complex behaviors at the network level.
*Without the need for receptors to recognize chemical messengers, signal transmission at electrical synapses is more rapid than that which occurs across chemical synapses, the predominant kind of junctions between neurons. Chemical transmission exhibits synaptic delay—recordings from squid synapses and neuromuscular junctions of the frog reveal a delay of 0.5 to 4.0 milliseconds—whereas electrical transmission takes place with almost no delay. However, the difference in speed between chemical and electrical synapses is not as marked in mammals as it is in cold-blooded animals.
*Because electrical synapses do not involve neurotransmitters, electrical neurotransmission is less modifiable than chemical neurotransmission.
*The response always has the same sign as the source. For example, depolarization of the pre-synaptic membrane will always induce a depolarization in the post-synaptic membrane, and vice versa for hyperpolarization.
*The response in the postsynaptic neuron is in general smaller in amplitude than the source. The amount of attenuation of the signal is due to the membrane resistance of the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.
*Long-term changes can be seen in electrical synapses. For example, changes in electrical synapses in the retina are seen during light and dark adaptations of the retina.

The relative speed of electrical synapses also allows for many neurons to fire synchronously. Because of the speed of transmission, electrical synapses are found in escape mechanisms and other processes that require quick responses, such as the response to danger of the sea hare &quot;Aplysia&quot;, which quickly releases large quantities of ink to obscure enemies&#x27; vision.

Normally, current carried by ions could travel in either direction through this type of synapse. However, sometimes the junctions are rectifying synapses, containing voltage-gated ion channels that open in response to depolarization of an axon&#x27;s plasma membrane, and prevent current from traveling in one of the two directions. Some channels may also close in response to increased calcium () or hydrogen () ion concentration, so as not to spread damage from one cell to another.

There is also evidence of synaptic plasticity where the electrical connection established can either be strengthened or weakened as a result of activity, or during changes in the intracellular concentration of magnesium.

Electrical synapses are present throughout the central nervous system and have been studied specifically in the neocortex, hippocampus, thalamic reticular nucleus, locus coeruleus, inferior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, olfactory bulb, retina, and spinal cord of vertebrates. Other examples of functional gap junctions detected &quot;in vivo&quot; are in the striatum, cerebellum, and suprachiasmatic nucleus.

== History ==
The model of a reticular network of directly interconnected cells was one of the early hypotheses for the organization of the nervous system at the beginning of the 20th century. This reticular hypothesis was considered to conflict directly with the now predominant &quot;neuron doctrine&quot;, a model in which isolated, individual neurons signal to each other chemically across synaptic gaps. These two models came into sharp contrast at the award ceremony for the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in which the award went jointly to Camillo Golgi, a reticularist and widely recognized cell biologist, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the champion of the neuron doctrine and the father of modern neuroscience. Golgi delivered his Nobel lecture first, in part detailing evidence for a reticular model of the nervous system. Ramón y Cajal then took the podium and refuted Golgi&#x27;s conclusions in his lecture. Modern understanding of the coexistence of chemical and electrical synapses, however, suggests that both models are physiologically significant; it could be said that the Nobel committee acted with great foresight in awarding the Prize jointly.

There was substantial debate on whether the transmission of information between neurons was chemical or electrical in the first decades of the twentieth century, but chemical synaptic transmission was seen as the only answer after Otto Loewi&#x27;s demonstration of chemical communication between neurons and heart muscle. Thus, the discovery of electrical communication was surprising.

Electrical synapses were first demonstrated between escape-related giant neurons in crayfish in the late 1950s, and were later found in vertebrates.

<text>The 6th Armored Division (&quot;Super Sixth&quot;) was an armored division of the United States Army during World War II. It was formed with a cadre from the 2nd Armored Division.

==History==

===Training===
The 6th Armored Division was activated on 15 February 1942 at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The major elements of the division originally were the 68th and 69th Armored Regiments and the 50th Armored Infantry Regiment; the 68th Armored Regiment had originally been part of the 1st Armored Division, while the 69th Armored Regiment had been part of the 2nd Armored Division. Brigadier General Carlos Brewer was assigned as the division&#x27;s first commanding general. It moved to Camp Chaffee on 15 March 1942 to make way for other Armored units, and then completed its assembly and unit training. The division then participated in the VIII Corps Louisiana Maneuvers from 25 August 1942, and then returned to Camp Chaffee on 21 September 1942. The 6th AD then moved to Camp Young at the Desert Training Center on 10 October 1942, and participated in the first California Maneuvers. 

===Reorganization===

The 6th AD then moved to Camp Cooke to continue its training, where it was reorganized in September 1943, losing its &quot;heavy&quot; organization of two armored regiments and one armored infantry regiment in favor of a &quot;light&quot; organization of three tank battalions and three armored infantry battalions. Maj. Gen. Robert W. Grow assumed command of the Division at Camp Cooke, California in May 1943 and commanded the division through the war until 30 July 1945. The 6th AD then staged at Camp Shanks, New York on 3 February 1944, departed the New York Port of Embarkation on 11 February 1944, and arrived in England on 23 February 1944.

After continuing its training in England, 6th AD landed on Utah Beach in Normandy on 19 July 1944 as a follow-on unit, and went on the offensive as separate combat commands in the Cotentin Peninsula in support of the Normandy Campaign.

=== Composition ===
The division was composed of the following units:

* Headquarters
* Headquarters Company
* Combat Command A
* Combat Command B
* Combat Command Reserve
* 15th Tank Battalion
* 68th Tank Battalion
* 69th Tank Battalion
* 9th Armored Infantry Battalion
* 44th Armored Infantry Battalion
* 50th Armored Infantry Battalion
* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 6th Armored Division Artillery
** 128th Armored Field Artillery Battalion
** 212th Armored Field Artillery Battalion

* 146th Armored Signal Company
* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 6th Armored Division Trains
** 128th Ordnance Maintenance Battalion
** 76th Armored Medical Battalion
** Military Police Platoon
** Band

===Combat chronicle===

At the end of the Normandy Campaign, 6th AD assembled at Le Mesnil on 25 July 1944. 6th AD then passed through 8th Infantry Division to clear the heights near Le Bingard on 27 July 1944, and Combat Command A secured a bridgehead across the Sienne (river) near Pont de la Roque on 29 July 1944, and overran Granville on 31 July 1944. 6th AD then returned to Avranches, where it relieved 4th AD and secured the area bridges.

In mid-August in Europe, the 6th Armored Division moved down to Lorient, where it was relieved by the 94th Infantry Division in September. Elements of the division participated in the Battle for Brest (7 August - 19 September 1944).

The 6th then turned east and cut across France, reaching the Saar in November. It crossed the Nied River on 11–12 November, against strong opposition, reaching the German border on 6 December, and established and maintained defensive positions in the vicinity of Saarbrücken.

On 23 December, the division was ordered north of Metz to take part in the Battle of the Bulge, and took over a sector along the south bank of the Sauer. The 6th was heavily engaged in the battle for Bastogne, finally driving the enemy back across the Our River into Germany by late January 1945.

After a short period of rehabilitation, the division resumed the offensive, penetrated the Siegfried Line, crossed the Prum, reached the Rhine River at Worms on 21 March, and set up a counterreconnaissance screen along its west bank. The 6th crossed the Rhine at Oppenheim on 25 March, drove on to Frankfurt, crossed the Main, captured Bad Nauheim, and continued to advance eastward, and surrounded and captured Mühlhausen on 4–5 April. After repulsing a light counterattack, it moved forward 60 miles to cross the Saale River and assisted in freeing Allied prisoners of war and the German concentration camp at Buchenwald. The division raced on, took Leipzig, crossed the River Zwickau Mulde at Rochlitz on 15 April 1945, and stopped, pending the arrival of the Red Army. Defensive positions along the Mulde River were held until the end of hostilities in Europe.

The division arrived at Camp Shanks, New York on 18 September 1945 and was inactivated.

===Casualties===

*Total battle casualties: 4,670
*Killed in action: 1,169
*Wounded in action: 3,667
*Missing in action: 88
*Prisoner of war: 83

=== Post-World War II ===
The division was reactivated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri on 5 September 1950 in response to the Korean War, and served as a training division until inactivation on 16 March 1956.

==Official history==
At the end of World War II, two 6th Armored Division G3 officers, Majors Paul L. Bogen and Clyde J. Burk along with Aide-de-Camp Captain Cyrus R. Shockey, compiled a &quot;Combat Record of the Sixth Armored Division in the European Theatre of Operations 18 July 1944 – 8 May 1945&quot;. The official history by George F. Hofmann, &quot;The Super Sixth: History of the 6th Armored Division in World War II&quot; (1975, reprinted 2000) has been called by World War II scholar Martin Blumenson, a &quot;first-rate military history.&quot; He also noted that General Patton called the 6th AD one of the two best divisions in his Third Army.

<doc id="441233" wikidata="Q953078" url="?curid=441233" title="Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March">
<text>Roger de Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, 6th Earl of Ulster (11 April 137420 July 1398) was an English nobleman. He was considered the heir presumptive to King Richard II, his mother&#x27;s first cousin, which made him a great-grandson of King Edward III.

Roger Mortimer&#x27;s father, the 3rd Earl of March, died in 1381, leaving the six-year-old Roger to succeed to his father&#x27;s title. The wardship and marriage of Roger was acquired by Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, who married him off to his daughter Alianore. During his lifetime, Mortimer spent much time in Ireland; he served several tenures as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and died during a battle at Kellistown, County Carlow. He was succeeded by his young son, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March.

==Early life==
Roger Mortimer was born 11 April 1374 at Usk in Monmouthshire. He was the eldest son of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, by his wife Philippa of Clarence, the daughter of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence (the second surviving son of King Edward III) by his wife Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster. Philippa passed on a strong claim to the English crown to her children. Roger had a younger brother, Edmund Mortimer, and two sisters, Elizabeth, who married Henry &#x27;Hotspur&#x27; Percy, and Philippa, who first married John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, secondly Richard de Arundel, 11th Earl of Arundel, and thirdly Sir Thomas Poynings.

===Wardship===
According to R. R. Davies, the wardship of such an important heir was an &quot;issue of political moment in the years 1382–4&quot;. Eventually, on 16 December 1383, Mortimer&#x27;s estates in England and Wales were granted for £4000 per annum to a consortium consisting of Mortimer himself, the Earls of Arundel, Northumberland, and Warwick, and John, Lord Neville. The guardianship of Mortimer&#x27;s person was initially granted to Arundel, but in August 1384, at the behest of Joan of Kent, the mother of King Richard II, Mortimer&#x27;s wardship and marriage were granted for 6000 marks to Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, Joan&#x27;s son and Richard&#x27;s half-brother. On or about 7 October 1388, at the age of 14, Mortimer was married off to his warder&#x27;s 18-year-old daughter Eleanor Holland, King Richard II&#x27;s half-niece. Mortimer did homage and was granted livery of his lands in Ireland on 18 June 1393, and of those in England and Wales on 25 February 1394.

King Richard had no issue. Mortimer, a lineal descendant of Edward III, was next in line to the throne and married to his half-niece. G. E. Cokayne states that in October 1385 Mortimer was proclaimed by the king as heir presumptive to the crown. However, according to R. R. Davies, the story that Richard publicly proclaimed Mortimer as heir presumptive in Parliament in October 1385 is baseless, although contemporary records indicate that his claim was openly discussed at the time. He was knighted by King Richard II on 23 April 1390.

==Career==
After he came of age, Mortimer spent much of his time in Ireland. King Richard had first made Mortimer his Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on 24 January 1382 when he was a child of seven, with his uncle, Sir Thomas Mortimer, acting as his deputy. The king reappointed Roger Mortimer as his lieutenant in Ireland on 23 July 1392, and in September 1394, Although he was nominally the king&#x27;s lieutenant, he made little headway against the native Irish chieftains. On 25 April 1396, the king appointed him lieutenant in Ulster, Connacht, and Meath, and Mortimer was in Ireland for most of the following three years. In April 1397, the king reappointed him as lieutenant for a further three years.

Mortimer&#x27;s residence in Ireland ensured that his political role in England was a minor one. His closest relationships in England appear to have been with family members, including his brother, Edmund, to whom he granted lands and annuities; the Percy family, into which his elder sister Elizabeth had married; and the Earl of Arundel, who had married his younger sister, Philippa.

As Davies points out, Mortimer&#x27;s &quot;wealth and lineage meant that, sooner or later, he would be caught up in the political turmoil of Richard II&#x27;s last years.&quot; On 4 September 1397, he was ordered to arrest his uncle, Sir Thomas Mortimer, for treason regarding his actions at the Battle of Radcot Bridge, but made no real attempt to do so. Even more inauspiciously, when summoned to a Parliament at Shrewsbury in January 1398, he was &#x27;rapturously received&#x27;, according to Adam Usk and the Wigmore chronicler, by a vast crowd of supporters wearing his colours. These events excited the king&#x27;s suspicions, and on Mortimer&#x27;s return to Ireland after the Parliament in January 1398, &#x27;his enemy, the Duke of Surrey, his brother-in-law, was ordered to follow and capture him&#x27;.

===Death===
On 20 July 1398, at the age of 24, Mortimer was slain in a skirmish at either Kells, County Meath, or Kellistown, County Carlow. The Wigmore chronicler says that he was riding in front of his army, unattended and wearing Irish garb, possibly illegally, and that those who slew him did not know who he was. He was interred at Wigmore Abbey. The King went to Ireland in the following year to avenge Mortimer&#x27;s death.

Mortimer&#x27;s young son, Edmund, succeeded him in the title and claim to the throne. The Wigmore chronicler, while criticising Mortimer for lust and remissness in his duty to God, extols him as &quot;of approved honesty, active in knightly exercises, glorious in pleasantry, affable and merry in conversation, excelling his contemporaries in the beauty of appearance, sumptuous in his feasting, and liberal in his gifts&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
By his wife Alianore Holland he had two sons and two daughters:

*Anne Mortimer (1388–1411) (born when her father was aged 14) who married Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge (1385–1415), of the House of York (her paternal grandmother&#x27;s first cousin), a grandson of King Edward III (Anne herself being a great-great-grand-daughter of King Edward III). Anne Mortimer&#x27;s grandsons were King Edward IV and King Richard III.
*Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March (1391–1425)
*Roger Mortimer (23 April 1393c. 1409)
*Eleanor Mortimer (born 1395–1422), who married Sir Edward de Courtenay (died 1418), and had no issue. Married secondly John Harpeden.

In June 1399, Roger Mortimer&#x27;s widow, Alianor, married Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton, by whom she had two daughters:
*Joan, who married John Grey, 1st Earl of Tankerville, brother of Sir Thomas Grey, executed for his part in the Southampton Plot which aimed to replace King Henry V with Eleanor&#x27;s son, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. Joan was co-heiress in 1425 to her half-brother, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March.
*Joyce, who married John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft.

Alianor died on 6 or 18 October 1405.

<text>The 7th Armored Division (&quot;Lucky Seventh&quot;) was an armored division of the United States Army that saw distinguished service on the Western Front, from August 1944 until May 1945, during World War II.

==History==
The division was activated on 1 March 1942, in Camp Polk, Louisiana, out of &quot;surplus&quot; elements of the reorganized 3rd and 5th Armored Divisions, and itself reorganized on 20 September 1943. The 7th Armored Division trained at Camp Coxcomb in California. The 7th Armored Division arrived in England in June 1944. Throughout most of its existence the 7th Armored Division was commanded by Major General Lindsay McDonald Silvester, an infantryman who had distinguished himself in World War I.

=== Composition ===
The division was composed of the following units:

* Headquarters
* Headquarters Company
* Combat Command A
* Combat Command B
* Combat Command Reserve
* 17th Tank Battalion
* 31st Tank Battalion
* 40th Tank Battalion
* 23rd Armored Infantry Battalion

** Band

===Action in France===
The 7th Armored Division landed on Omaha and Utah Beaches, 13–14 August 1944, and was assigned to U.S. Third Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton. The division drove through Nogent-le-Rotrou in an attack on Chartres. The city fell on 18 August. From Chartres, the division advanced to liberate Dreux and then Melun, where they crossed the Seine River, 24 August. The division then pushed on to bypass Reims and liberate Château-Thierry and then Verdun, 31 August.

The 7th Armored halted briefly for refueling and then on 6 September drove on toward the Moselle and made a crossing near Dornot. This crossing had to be withdrawn in the face of the heavy fortifications around Metz. The 7th Armored then made attempts to cross the Moselle northwest of Metz but the deep river valley was not suitable terrain for an armored attack. Elements of the division assisted the 5th Infantry Division in expanding a bridgehead east of Arnaville, south of Metz, and on 15 September, the main part of the division crossed the Moselle there. The 7th Armored Division was repulsed in its attacks across the Seille River at and near Sillegny, part of an attack in conjunction with the 5th Infantry division that was also repulsed further north.

===Support of Operation Market Garden===
On 25 September 1944, the 7th Armored Division was transferred to the U.S. Ninth Army, under Lieutenant General William Hood Simpson, and began the march to the Netherlands where they were needed to protect the right (east) flank of the corridor opened by Operation Market Garden. They were to operate in the southeast Netherlands, so that British and Canadian forces and the 104th Infantry Division could clear the Germans from the Scheldt Estuary in the southwest Netherlands and open the shipping lanes to the critical port of Antwerp, to allow Allied ships to bring supplies from Britain.

On 30 September, the 7th Armored Division launched an attack from the north on the town of Overloon, against significant German defenses. The attacks progressed slowly and finally settled into a series of counter-attacks reminiscent of trench warfare of World War I. On 8 October, the division was relieved from the attack on Overloon by the British 11th Armoured Division and moved south of Overloon to the Deurne–Weert area. Here they were attached to the British Second Army, under Lieutenant General Sir Miles C. Dempsey, and ordered to make demonstration attacks to the east, in order to divert enemy forces from the Overloon and Venlo areas, where British troops pressed the attack. This plan succeeded, and the British were finally able to liberate Overloon.

On 27 October 1944, the main part of the 7th Armored Division was in essentially defensive positions along the line Nederweert (and south) to Meijel to Liesel, with the demonstration force still in the attack across the Deurne canal to the east. The Germans launched a two-division offensive centered on Meijel, catching the thinly stretched 87th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron of the 7th Armored Division by surprise. However, the response by the 7th Armored and by British Lieutenant General Sir Richard O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s British VIII Corps, to which the division was attached, stopped the German attack on the third day and then from 31 October to 8 November gradually drove the enemy out of the terrain that they had taken. During this operation, at midnight on the night of 31 October–1 November Major General Lindsay Silvester, who had led the division since its activation, was relieved as commander of the division and replaced by Major General Robert W. Hasbrouck.

===Refit and retraining===
On 8 November 1944, the 7th Armored was again transferred to the Ninth Army and moved south to rest areas at and east of Maastricht. Following an inflow of many replacements, they began extensive training and reorganization, since so many original men had been lost in France and the Netherlands that a significant part of the division was now men who had never trained together. At the end of November, the division straddled the Dutch-German border with one combat command in Germany (in the area of Ubach, north of Aachen) and two in the Netherlands.

Elements of the division were attached to the 84th Infantry Division for operations in early December in the area of Linnich, Germany, on the banks of the Rur (Roer). The 7th was preparing to drive into Germany when the Ardennes offensive began on 16 December 1944.

===Battle of the Bulge===
The division was transferred to the U.S. First Army, under Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges, and ordered to St. Vith, Belgium, a critical road and rail center needed by the Germans to supply their offensive. Over the course of almost a week, the 7th Armored (along with elements of the 106th, the 28th Infantry Division and 9th Armored Divisions) absorbed much of the weight of the German drive, throwing the German time table into great disarray, before being forced to withdraw west of the Salm River on 23 December. The division moved to the area of Manhay, Belgium, and by the end of December had cleared the town of the enemy. They were then relieved by the 75th Infantry Division. After a brief rest in January 1945, the division returned to positions near St. Vith, attacked, and re-captured the town on 23 January 1945. The 7th armored division was awarded the Belgian &quot;fourragère&quot; for their action.

===Movement into Germany===
In February 1945, now attached to the U.S. First Army&#x27;s V Corps, the division returned to Germany. In the first week of the month, Combat Command R was attached to 78th Infantry Division for attacks on Strauch, Simmerath, Steckenborn, and other towns in the area of the Huertgen Forest. The Division remained in the area of Steckenborn, Germany throughout the month, waiting for the flood waters to recede after the Germans destroyed major dams in the Allies&#x27; path. However, large contingents of men were sent back into Belgium and attached to Engineer Combat Battalions (e.g. most of the men of 38 AIB were attached to 1110 Engineers at Stavelot) from 12 to 27 February, for use as laborers in using logs to build a solid base for the torn-up roads through the Ardennes Forest.

In March 1945, the 7th Armored took part in two major breakthroughs with a two-week period during which they established and maintained an important defensive position. The first breakthrough came early in March when the division, as part of the III Corps, pushed east from the Rur river to establish a defensive position along the west bank of the Rhine, south of Bonn to Unkelbach. The second major breakthrough began 26 March when the division, still under III Corps control, took part in an armored offensive intended to break the thin crust ringing the Remagen bridgehead and overrun the rich German farmland to the east and north and surround the Ruhr Pocket in a double envelopment.

In April, the 7th Armored Division completed their part of the encirclement of the Ruhr Pocket and captured the critical Edersee Dam. They then attacked into the Ruhr Pocket, in order to reduce it. On 16 April the LIII Panzer Corps surrendered to the division and the eastern sector of the pocket collapsed. The 7th Armored, after a brief rest, were then transferred once again to the British Second Army and moved north to the Baltic Sea. From this area, Lieutenant William A. Knowlton led a force eastward to make contact with the Red Army. The 7th Armored Division remained in this area until the war in Europe ended.

===Casualties===
* Total battle casualties: 5,799
* Killed in action: 898
* Wounded in action: 3,811
* Missing in action: 165
* Prisoner of war: 925

===Occupation duty===
The division was then moved into the future Soviet zone of occupation, at Dessau, Germany. President Truman wanted one of his armored divisions parading in front of him on the 4 July in Berlin, and 2nd and 7th Armored were both prepared for the honor. When the 2nd Armored was chosen for the parade, 7th Armored immediately moved southwest to the future American zone of occupation.

The division then began to be gradually filled with more and more new faces, as the veterans were transferred elsewhere. The first large contingent of veterans left in mid July: these were low-point men who were headed back to the United States to begin training for the invasion of Japan. Other large groups of high-point men were transferred to other units that were going back home before the 7th Armored Division was inactivated.

===Inactivation===
The division returned to New York and was inactivated on 11 October 1945.

<doc id="441235" wikidata="Q312990" url="?curid=441235" title="Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March">
<text>Roger Mortimer, 3rd Baron Mortimer of Wigmore, 1st Earl of March (25 April 1287 – 29 November 1330), was an English nobleman and powerful marcher lord who gained many estates in the Welsh Marches and Ireland following his advantageous marriage to the wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville. Her mother was of the royal House of Lusignan. In November 1316, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 for having led the marcher lords in a revolt against King Edward II in what became known as the Despenser War.

He later escaped to France, where he was joined by Edward&#x27;s queen consort Isabella, where they had an affair. After he and Isabella led a successful invasion and rebellion, Edward was deposed; Mortimer allegedly arranged his murder at Berkeley Castle. For three years, Mortimer was &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of England before being himself overthrown by Edward&#x27;s eldest son, Edward III. Accused of assuming royal power and other crimes, Mortimer was executed by hanging at Tyburn.

== Early life ==
Mortimer, grandson of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer of Wigmore, and Maud de Braose, was born at Wigmore Castle, Herefordshire, England, the firstborn of marcher lord Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer of Wigmore, and Margaret de Fiennes. Through his mother Margaret, he was a great-grandson of John of Brienne, Emperor of Constantinople and King of Jerusalem. Through his father he was descended from John, King of England.

Edmund Mortimer was a second son, intended for minor orders and a clerical career. But on the deaths of his elder brother Ralph in 1274, and his father in 1282, Edmund was recalled from Oxford University and succeeded to the title. He married in 1285.

Roger was born on 25 April 1287, the Feast of Saint Mark, a day of bad omen. He shared this birthday with King Edward II, which would be relevant later in life.

According to his biographer Ian Mortimer, Roger was possibly sent as a boy to be fostered in the household of his formidable uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk. De Chirk had helped Edmund kill Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of Wales in 1282 and had then carried Llywelyn&#x27;s severed head to King Edward I. Ironically Roger was a cousin of Llywelyn via his great-grandmother, Gwladus Ddu.

Roger attended the coronation of Edward II on 25 February 1308 and carried a table bearing the royal robes in the ceremony&#x27;s procession.

== Marriage ==
Like many noble children of his time, Mortimer was betrothed at a young age, to Joan de Geneville (born 1286), the daughter of Sir Peter de Geneville, of Trim Castle and Ludlow. They were married on 20 September 1301 when he was aged fourteen. Their first child was born in 1302.

Through his marriage, Mortimer not only acquired numerous possessions in the Welsh Marches, including the important Ludlow Castle, which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also extensive estates and influence in Ireland. However, Joan de Geneville was not an &quot;heiress&quot; at the time of her marriage. Her grandfather Geoffrey de Geneville, at the age of eighty in 1308, conveyed most, but not all, of his Irish lordships to Mortimer, and then retired: he finally died in 1314, with Joan succeeding as &quot;suo jure&quot; 2nd Baroness Geneville. During his lifetime Geoffrey also conveyed much of the remainder of his legacy, such as Kenlys, to his younger son Simon de Geneville, who had meanwhile become Baron of Culmullin through marriage to Joanna FitzLeon. Mortimer, therefore, succeeded to the eastern part of the Lordship of Meath, centred on Trim and its stronghold of Trim Castle. He did not succeed, however, to the Lordship of Fingal.

== Military adventures in Ireland and Wales ==
Mortimer&#x27;s childhood came to an abrupt end when his father was mortally wounded in a skirmish near Builth in July 1304. Since Mortimer was underage at the death of his father, he was placed by King Edward I under the guardianship of Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall. However, on 22 May 1306, in a lavish ceremony in Westminster Abbey with 259 others, he was knighted by Edward and granted livery of his full inheritance.

His adult life began in earnest in 1308, when he went to Ireland in person to enforce his authority. This brought him into conflict with the de Lacys, who turned for support to Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, King of Scots. Mortimer was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by Edward II on 23 November 1316. Shortly afterwards, at the head of a large army, he drove Bruce to Carrickfergus and the de Lacys into Connaught, wreaking vengeance on their adherents whenever they were to be found. He returned to England and Wales in 1318 and was then occupied for some years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border.

== Opposition to Edward II ==
Mortimer became disaffected with his king and joined the growing opposition to Edward II and the Despensers. After the younger Despenser was granted lands belonging to him, he and the marchers began conducting devastating raids against Despenser&#x27;s property in Wales. He supported Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, in refusing to obey the king&#x27;s summons to appear before him in 1321 as long as &quot;the younger Despencer was in the King&#x27;s train.&quot; Mortimer led a march against London, his men wearing the Mortimer uniform which was green with a yellow sleeve. He was prevented from entering the capital, although his forces put it under siege. These acts of insurrection compelled the Lords Ordainers led by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, to order the king to banish the Despensers in August. When the king led a successful expedition in October against Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere, after she had refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle, he used his victory and new popularity among the moderate lords and the people to summon the Despensers back to England. Mortimer, in company with other Marcher Lords, led a rebellion against Edward, which is known as the Despenser War.

In January 1322, Mortimer attacked and burnt Bridgnorth but, being heavily outnumbered, was forced to surrender to the king at Shrewsbury. Mortimer joined Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March 1322 and warrants for his arrest were issued in July.

A death sentence was passed upon Mortimer but this was commuted to life imprisonment and he was consigned to the Tower of London. On 1 August 1323, Mortimer, aided by Bishop Adam Orleton of Hereford and Gerald de Alspaye, the sub-lieutenant or valet of the Tower&#x27;s Constable, drugged the warders during a feast, allowing Mortimer to escape. He attempted to capture Windsor and Wallingford Castles to free imprisoned Contrariants. Mortimer eventually fled to France, pursued by warrants for his capture dead or alive.

In the following year Queen Isabella, anxious to escape from her husband, obtained his consent to her going to France to use her influence with her brother, King Charles IV, in favour of peace. At the French court, the queen found Mortimer, who became her lover soon afterwards. At his instigation, she refused to return to England so long as the Despensers retained power as the king&#x27;s favourites.

Historians have speculated as to the date at which Mortimer and Isabella actually became lovers. The modern view is that the affair began while both were still in England and that after a disagreement, Isabella abandoned Mortimer to his fate in the Tower. His subsequent escape became one of medieval England&#x27;s most colourful episodes. However, almost certainly Isabella risked everything by chancing Mortimer&#x27;s companionship and emotional support when they first met again in Paris four years later (Christmas 1325). King Charles IV&#x27;s protection of Isabella at the French court from Despenser&#x27;s would-be assassins played a large part in developing the relationship.

In 1326, Mortimer moved as Prince Edward&#x27;s guardian to Hainault, but only after a furious dispute with the queen, demanding she remain in France.

Isabella retired to raise troops in her County of Ponthieu; Mortimer arranged the invasion fleet supplied by the Hainaulters and an army supplied by his supporters back in England, who had been sending him aid and advice since at least March 1326.

== Invasion of England and defeat of Edward II ==
The scandal of Isabella&#x27;s relations with Mortimer compelled them both to withdraw from the French court to Flanders, where they obtained assistance for an invasion of England from Count William of Hainaut, although Isabella did not arrive from Ponthieu until the fleet was due to sail. Landing in the River Orwell on 24 September 1326, they were accompanied by Prince Edward and Henry, Earl of Lancaster. London rose in support of the queen, and Edward took flight to the west, pursued by Mortimer and Isabella. After wandering helplessly for some weeks in Wales, the king was taken prisoner on 16 November and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son. Though the latter was crowned as Edward III of England on 1 February 1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella. On 21 September that same year, Edward II died in captivity. The suspicious death of Edward II has been the subject of many conspiracy theories, including that Mortimer&#x27;s men killed him, but none has been proven.

== Powers won and lost ==
Following the removal of the Despensers, Mortimer set to work restoring the status of his supporters, primarily in the Marches, and hundreds of pardons and restorations of property were made in the first year of the new king&#x27;s reign. Rich estates and offices of profit and power were heaped on Mortimer. He was made constable of Wallingford Castle and in September 1328 he was created Earl of March. However, although in military terms he was far more competent than the Despensers, his ambition was troubling to all. His own son Geoffrey, the only one to survive into old age, mocked him as &quot;the king of folly&quot; deriding his ambitious extravagance of &quot;rich clothes ot of manner resoun, both of shaping and wearing&quot;. During his short time as ruler of England he took over the lordships of Denbigh, Oswestry and Clun (the first of which belonged to Despenser, the latter two had been the Earl of Arundel&#x27;s). He was also granted the &quot;marcher&quot; lordship of Montgomery by the queen. During the War of Saint-Sardos, the Regent and his queen spent over £60,000 bankrupting the Treasury, even after the proscriptions of Arundel and the Despensers. The Lancastrian opposition were incensed by this casual display of irresponsible government.

The jealousy and anger of many nobles were aroused by Mortimer&#x27;s use of power, which in many ways was tenuous. In 1328 Simon de Mepham, reportedly a Lancastrian at court, was elected Archbishop of Canterbury without controversy. However, the feuding would not stop. The day Parliament opened on 15 October Thomas of Lancaster&#x27;s nemesis, Sir Robert Holland was murdered by highway robbers. Whereupon March swore on Mepham&#x27;s cross that he knew nothing of it. Nonetheless, the King decreed an indictment; he would be judged at law against the standards of the Magna Carta. With Parliament adjourned on 31 October, he was able to slip away to his estates on the Marches. The two earls&#x27; lethal enmity, and enforced absence from the King&#x27;s presence, rendered their motives almost equally suspect to rowdy Londoners. The young king would have to raise an army of archers if he was to defend his throne from a northern rebellion controlled by Lancaster. In charge of the army, Lancaster blamed Mortimer and his queen for the debacle, and the highly contentious Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton with the Scots.

Henry, Earl of Lancaster, one of the principals behind Edward II&#x27;s deposition, tried to overthrow Mortimer, but the action was ineffective as the young king passively stood by. Then, in March 1330, Mortimer ordered the execution of Edmund, Earl of Kent, the half-brother of Edward II. After this execution Henry Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III, to assert his independence. In October 1330, a Parliament was summoned to Nottingham, just days before Edward&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, and Mortimer and Isabella were seized by Edward and his companions from inside Nottingham Castle via an underground tunnel. In spite of Isabella&#x27;s entreaty to her son, &quot;Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer&quot;, Mortimer was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November 1330, his vast estates forfeited to the crown. His body hung at the gallows for two days and nights in full view of the populace. Mortimer&#x27;s widow Joan received a pardon in 1336 and survived until 1356. She was buried beside Mortimer at Wigmore, but the site was later destroyed.

In 2002, the actor John Challis, the owner of the remaining buildings of Wigmore Abbey, invited the BBC programme &quot;House Detectives at Large&quot; to investigate his property. During the investigation, a document was discovered in which Mortimer&#x27;s widow Joan petitioned Edward III for the return of her husband&#x27;s body so she could bury it at Wigmore Abbey. Mortimer&#x27;s lover Isabella had buried his body at Greyfriars in Coventry following his hanging. Edward III replied, &quot;Let his body rest in peace&quot;. The king later relented, and Mortimer&#x27;s body was transferred to Wigmore Abbey, where Joan was later buried beside him.

== Children ==
The marriages of Mortimer&#x27;s children (four sons and eight daughters) cemented Mortimer&#x27;s strengths in the West:
* Sir Edmund Mortimer (1302/1303 – 16 December 1331), married Elizabeth de Badlesmere; they produced Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March, who was restored to his grandfather&#x27;s title;
* Margaret Mortimer (1304 – 5 May 1337), married Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley;
* Roger Mortimer (1305–1328), married Joan Butler;
* Maud Mortimer (1307 – after 1345), married John de Charlton, Lord of Powys;
* Geoffrey Mortimer (1308/1309 – 1372/1376), who inherited the French seigneurie of Couhé as the assigned heir of his grandmother Joan of Lusignan, and founded a branch of the family based in France;
* John Mortimer (c. 1310 – 1328);
* Joan Mortimer (c. 1311/1312 – 1337/1351), married James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley;
* Isabel Mortimer (c. 1313 – after 1327);
* Katherine Mortimer (c. 1314 – 4 August 1369), married Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick;
* Agnes Mortimer (c. 1317 – 25 July 1368), married Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke;
* Beatrice Mortimer (c. 1319 – 16 October 1383), who married, firstly, Edward of Norfolk (died before 9 August 1334), son and heir apparent of Thomas of Brotherton, by whom she had no issue, and, secondly, before 13 September 1337, Thomas de Brewes (died 9 or 16 June 1361), by whom she had three sons and three daughters;
* Blanche Mortimer (c. 1321 – 1347), married Peter de Grandison, 2nd Baron Grandison.

== Descendants ==
Through his son Sir Edmund Mortimer, he is an ancestor of the last Plantagenet monarchs of England from kings Edward IV to Richard III. By Edward IV&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth of York, the Earl of March is an ancestor to King Henry VIII of England and King James V of Scotland, and therefore to all subsequent Scottish, English and British monarchs.

== Ancestry ==
== In fiction ==
Mortimer appears in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Edward II&quot; (c. 1592), the Restoration tragedy &quot;Edward III&quot; (1690), as well as Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Edward II of England&quot; (1923). In Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Edward II&quot; (1991), based on Marlowe&#x27;s play, he is portrayed by Nigel Terry.

Mortimer is also a character in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. He was portrayed by Claude Giraud in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Bruno Todeschini in the 2005 adaptation. Mortimer is also briefly mentioned in the 2001 film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; as a contestant in a joust.

Mortimer is also a character in &quot;World Without End&quot; played by Hannes Jaenicke.

<text>The 8th Armored Division was an armored division of the United States Army that served in the European Theater of World War II.

==History==
===Stateside===
The successes of the German armored units in Poland and France underscored America&#x27;s need for an effective armored force. The tank battles of North Africa and Russia in early 1942 caused the US Army to recognize the need to drastically increase the number of its armored units. The 8th Armored Division was activated on 1 April 1942 at Fort Knox, Kentucky, with &quot;surplus&quot; units of the recently reorganized 4th Armored Division and newly organized units. The division served as the first official military guardian of the gold vault at Fort Knox. From 1942 to 1944 it functioned as a training command stationed at Camp Polk, Louisiana. During this period the 8th supplied trained personnel to the 9th through 14th Armored Divisions. In September 1943 the division completed reorganization from the old style triangular division to the new &#x27;light&#x27; armored division, as per War Department Letter AG-322, in preparation for activation as a combat unit. The light format armored division was made up of three combat commands referred to as Combat Command A (CCA), Combat Command B (CCB) and a smaller unit called Combat Command Reserve (CCR). Units could be assigned to one of the combat commands at need, creating a very flexible formation.
During December 1943, the division participated in the D Series of exercises in Texas. The D Series were small scale maneuver problems designed as a precursor to the full scale Sixth Louisiana Maneuver Period. The D Series included exercises to simulate contact with the enemy and included recon, movement to contact, engineering and minefield clearing problems. The 8th completed the D Series and participated in the Sixth Louisiana Maneuver Period from February through April 1944 as part of the Red Force.

From the period of April through October 1944, the division conducted post-maneuver training, losing a number of trained personnel to other units and absorbing and training their replacements. At the end of October the 8th received movement orders to Camp Kilmer, New York in preparation for shipment overseas. On 6 November 1944 the division left Camp Kilmer and boarded ships in New Jersey for the United Kingdom. The ships arrived in Southampton on 18 November and the division moved to Tidworth Camp, joining the newly formed Fifteenth Army.

===England, France and &#x27;The Bulge&#x27;===
After some additional training and acquisition of new equipment at Tidworth, England, the 8th Armored Division landed in France, 5 January 1945, at Le Havre and Rouen. The division assembled in the Bacqueville area of upper Normandy as part of the (then still secret) Fifteenth Army and was placed in reserve. In mid-January the division was seconded to the Third Army and raced across France through heavy snow and ice to Pont-à-Mousson to help stem the German drive for Strasbourg, part of the German Operation Nordwind It was at this point that the division was assigned the call-sign &#x27;Tornado&#x27;. A detachment of the 88th Armored Cavalry undertook the division&#x27;s first combat action – a reconnaissance of the best route to contact with the enemy. The division, finding the enemy already halted and beginning to fall back, took part in the Third Army drive against the Moselle-Saar salient. The 8th supported the 94th Infantry Division&#x27;s attack on Nennig, Berg and Sinz, 19–28 January 1945 aimed at reducing the salient between the Saar and Moselle Rivers.

===Belgium and The Netherlands===

Nennig and Berg were defended by elements of the German 11th Panzer Division; specifically the 110th, 111th and elements of the 774th Panzer Grenadier Regiments. German losses in action against 8th Armored units were 5 Panzer IV tanks, 72 prisoners and many dead and wounded. 8th Armored losses were 3 M4A3 Sherman tanks, 4 Half-tracks and heavy personnel casualties.

From Berg, the 8th continued their advance through Sinz and more heavy fighting. German losses were 8 tanks, 1 anti-aircraft gun, 1 anti-tank gun and 1 half-track. Division losses were an additional 6 tanks destroyed and 4 disabled as well as heavy personnel casualties. The week&#x27;s action resulted in the loss of 50% of the personnel the 110th and 111th Panzer-Grenadier Regiments had brought into the Saar-Moselle triangle.

The division moved to Simpelveld, the Netherlands for rest and refitting absorbing approximately 200 replacements. The 8th was now part of the Ninth Army and continued refitting and replacing losses during the first half of February 1945. On 19 February the division moved to Roermond, the Netherlands to relieve the British 7th Armoured Division in the vicinity of Echt and launched a diversionary attack as part of Operation Grenade, pushing the enemy north of the Heide woods and east of the Roer River.

===The Roer to the Rhine===
On 27 February, 8th Armored crossed the Roer River via the Hilfarth Bridge which had been captured by the 35th Infantry Division. CCA headed for the town of Wegberg. CCB moved through Sittard, Gangelt, Geilenkirchen, Randerath, and Brachelen to arrive at the Hilfarth Bridge and crossed after CCA. CCA tanks and infantry destroyed fifteen pillboxes, captured Tetelrath, and crossed the Schwalm river while CCB attacked and captured the towns of Arsbeck and Ober Kruchten.

On 2 March – CCA captured Lobberich, moved through the 35th Inf. Div. and secured the town of Wachtendonk at the confluence of Niers River and Nette River. Co. C of the 53rd Engineers worked through the night to bridge the Niers River which was holding up the advance on Moers.

3 March CCB moved through CCA area and captured Aldekerk while CCR captured Saint Hubert, Vinnbruck and Saelhuysen in their advance toward Moers. The Division received orders to cease forward movement as it was &#x27;pinched out&#x27; by the 35th Inf. on the right and the 84th Inf. on the left.

CCB was detached and assigned to the 35th Inf. Div. so an attack could be mounted in the direction of Rheinberg and Wesel to prevent the Germans from crossing the Rhine River. CCB attacked Lintfort and Rheinberg with the 35th. Heavy fighting, primarily against the 130th Panzer Division, took place in and around Rheinberg resulting in 199 divisional casualties and the loss of 41 tanks while the Germans suffered 350 men killed and 512 taken prisoner. The area (nicknamed &#x27;88 Lane&#x27;) was under direct anti-tank and heavy artillery fire so each house had to be cleared by dismounted infantry. By 7 March a foothold was secured at Grunthal, a road crossing (B 57/B 58) in the vicinity of Alpen.

The same day the US 9th Armored Division captured a bridge over the Rhine at Remagen. The 130th Panzer Division was pulled out of the Wesel area and moved south to counterattack. By 9 March CCB of the 8th secured the town of Ossenberg as well as the towns of Borth and Wallach. CCB was relieved at 2400 and ordered to the Venlo, the Netherlands, rest area, the relief being completed on 10 and 11 March.

The division was assigned to cleanup operations in the rear areas of the Rhineland which had been bypassed during the movement to the Rhine River. During this period the division became the first US or British unit to uncover the existence of the secret Werwolf organization when several cleverly camouflaged bunkers were discovered, each containing 12 to 15 fully equipped German soldiers.

On 22 March division artillery units moved into firing positions in preparation for the assault on the east bank of the Rhine River as part of Operation Plunder. On 23 March all artillery units commenced firing over 130,000 rounds preceding the initial crossing of the Rhine River to be made by the 30th Infantry Division.

===The Rhine to the Ruhr===

On 24 March 18 Tank Bn of the 8th Armored Division was ferried across in support of the 30th Infantry prior to the Division&#x27;s crossing. An 18th tank was the first across the Rhine in the 9th Army area and assisted in the capture of Spellen, the first town captured east of the Rhine by 9th Army. The division was the first armored division to cross the Rhine in the 9th Army area, crossing at bridge sites &#x27;G&#x27; and &#x27;H&#x27;.

The 8th received orders on 27 March to secure the road running from Hamm to Soest. CCA attacked on the left flank and captured Im Loh then moved on to bypass Dorsten. Heavy house to house fighting slowed the attack. New orders were received late in the next day to capture Dorsten so that the Lippe River could be bridged allowing armor to move northward.

In the meantime, CCR, located near Bruckhausen launched an attack on Zweckel and Kirchhellen to the south on 28 March. The 116th Panzer Division was defending both and the approaches had been heavily mined. CCR captured Zweckel in the afternoon and launched an attack on Kirchellen which was secured by nightfall. An advance unit of the 80th Tank battalion that had been surrounded in Kirchellen since early that morning was relieved.

CCA captured Dorsten early the next morning and CCB moved in to secure the area so CCA could join CCR in their advance to the east towards the town of Marl. Marl was cleared by nightfall. CCA then swung southeast from Dorsten heading for Polsum. CCR attacked and captures the towns of Scholven and Feldhausen. On 29 March the German 180th Volks Grenadier Division and the 116th Panzer Division withdrew and set up new defensive lines running through the fortress town of Recklinghausen.

CCR crossed the Rappholtz-Muhlen Canal on 30 March and captured Buer-Hassel. Co. C, 53 Armored Engineers built a bridge across the canal in just 44 minutes. The next day CCR captured Kolonie Bertlich. Heading east, it passed through Westerholt and Langenbochum, engaging the German defenses in Recklinghausen only away.

On 31 March the division was relieved by units of the 75th Inf. Div. The 8th crossed the Lippe River, and assembled at Selm. The 8th received orders on 1 April from XIX Corps to set up two spearheads for an attack to the east, the 2nd Armored and 30th Infantry in one and the 8th Armored and 83rd Infantry in the other. CCA was assigned to attack Delbrück, CCB to attack Paderborn.

The 8th launched its attack on schedule but CCB was soon stalled by fierce German resistance at Neuhaus. On 3 April fighter-bombers (known as Jabos by the troops) of the US 9th Air Corps provided close air support in the Teutoburg Forest and Neuhaus areas. CCR and moved up to attack Elsen to help CCB repel a strong German counterattack launched from Sennelager. CCA attacked Sennelager directly in an attempt to reduce a German strongpoint.

At the end of 3 April the division was relieved by the 83rd Inf. Div. and received orders to attack towards the west to help reduce the Ruhr Pocket.

===Ruhr Pocket===
The success of the Rhine crossing operations by Allied forces encircled approximately 430,000 German soldiers of Army Group B comprising 21 divisions of the Wehrmacht, trapping them in an area that came to be known as the Ruhr Pocket. The Twelfth Army Group was tasked with reducing the pocket.

On 3 April 8 turned 180 degrees in response to orders into the Ruhr Pocket and CCR attacked west toward Recklinghausen. CCR captured the towns of Stripe and Norddorf, and continued through Vollinghausen, Oberhagen, and Ebbinghausen before stopping for the night in front of Horne. The next day CCA attacked Erwitte. The US 9th Air Force continued to provide close air support as the division continued into the Ruhr Pocket through heavy fighting in the Lippstadt area.

Col. Wallace, the commander of CCR, was captured by German forces during the night of 4 April. On 5 April Col. Vesely assumed command of CCR and continued to attack westward capturing the towns of Horne, Klieve, Schmerlacke and Serlinghausen. At the end of the day, CCB relieved CCR and attacked westward toward Soest; capturing the towns of Schallen and Lohne while CCA continued attacking south capturing the towns of Anroechte, Mensel, Drewer, and Altenruthen. On 6 April, CCB made a &#x27;end run&#x27; around Soest to the outskirts of Ost Onnen to cut off a German breakout path from the Ruhr pocket.

While CCB blocked the German withdrawal near Ost Onnen, CCA cleared the area north of the Moehne River so glider troops could be landed in case of a break-out attempt in that area. They captured the towns of Wamel, Brullinggsen, Ellingsen, and Westendorf. CCR, in the meantime, outposted all roads northeast of Soest to facilitate an attack on the town by the 94th Inf. Div.

On 7 April the eastward movement of the US 2nd Armored Division and the westward movement of the 8th Armored created a gap of between the two fronts. This would allow German forces to briefly cut off the US 2nd Armored. Troop A, 88th Reconnaissance Squadron captured the Moehne Talsperre Dam on the 7th to prevent the Germans from flooding the Moehne Valley. CCB began an attack on Werl in the afternoon and captured Gerlingen. The burgomeister of Ost Onnen surrendered the town later that day. The following day CCR moved to secure the road between Werl and Wickede and captured the towns of Parsit, Bremen, Vierhausen, Schluckingen and Wiehagen capturing 238 German soldiers, 1 Tiger tank, and 3 88 mm anti-tank guns. CCB captured Werl by late afternoon after heavy resistance during the day. They then captured Ost Buederich by the end of the day.

By 9 April, The threat of a German breakout had passed due to the buildup of allied troops in the area. CCB moved on Unna capturing Holtun and Hemmerude. The following day CCB continued the attack on Unna and captured Lernen. A ten-minute air strike was laid on Unna to soften it up. The Germans moved reinforcements, including Hitler Youth into Unna from the Muelhausen garrison.

On 10 April CCR advanced in fierce fighting and secured Stentrop, Bausenhagen, Scheda, Beutrap Wemen, and Fromern. The following day CCA joined the attack on Unna and CCB went into reserve. CCB had suffered 198 casualties this period. The next day CCR captured Hohenheide and Fröndenberg after an air strike drove 4 German tanks out of the town. The town of Billmerich was also captured. Unna finally fell that afternoon after another air strike. The Germans lost 160 personnel, 2 tanks and a battery of 88&#x27;s. This surrender was the end of organized resistance from the 116th Panzer Division.

CCA continued cleaning up operations in Unna while CCR captured the towns of Hengsen, Ostendorf, Ottendorf, and Dellwig. CCA was relieved on 13 April and ordered to move east of Unna across the Weser River to the vicinity of Wolfenbüttel. CCA had lost 2 tanks, 1 half-track and 1 jeep during these operations. CCB was assigned to protect right flank of the 2nd Armored and the 83rd Inf. Div. as they moved east. They move to Wolfenbüttel. Later CCR was relieved and ordered to move to the vicinity of Denstorf. On the drive west, CCR suffered 203 casualties and lost 11 tanks, 3 jeeps, 9 half-tracks. The German forces lost 6 Mark V Panther tanks, 4 20 mm guns, 1 large railroad gun, and 3 tons of small arms.

===Central Germany===

After leaving the Ruhr Pocket on 13 April the division moved east. The 8th participated in the liberation of the Halberstadt-Zwieberge concentration camps near Langenstein (see below). Most of CCB moved on to Halberstadt with some units remaining in Wolfenbüttel until the rest of the Division arrived. On 14 April the remaining units of the Division began moving to an assembly area in the vicinity of Braunschweig with CCA going to Wolfenbüttel and CCR going to Denstorf.

For the period of 15–18 April CCB cleared the area near the Hartz Mountains of remnants of the 11th Panzer Army while CCA began moving to Seehausen to support the attack on Magdeburg by the XIX Corps. CCR moved from Denstorf to Braunschweig and continued screening the rear areas.

CCB completed clearing resistance from the edge of Forest Heimburg south of Derenburg while units of the 2nd Armored relieved CCR allowing it to move into the vicinity of Stroebeck in preparation for reducing resistance in Blankenburg.
On 19 April CCA was relieved and returned to Wernigerode from Seehausen where it in turn relieved the 330th Inf. Reg. of the 83rd Inf. Div. CCB moved to Westerhausen and CCR moved to Aspenstedt to clear the remaining woods around Blankenburg. The next day the division began to attack Blankenburg. At 1000 hours a 13 plane squadron attacked Blankenburg and immediately afterward the burgomeister was contacted about surrendering after a show of force. By nightfall, most of Blankenburg had surrendered except for a few strongpoints that comprised fanatical resisters unwilling to lay down their arms or soldiers who had not yet received word to surrender.

On 21 April CCR cleared the woods south of Blankenburg and linked up with elements of the 1st Inf. Div. of the First Army. By 22 April the last organized resistance ended with the capture of Gen. Heinz Kokott, commanding officer of the 26th Volks Grenadier Div and brother-in-law of Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler.

During the period of 23 April through 8 May the division was assigned an area of 90 kilometers long by 30 kilometers wide and went into occupation duty. Some additional cleanup was required of small pockets of resistance as stragglers were found.

===Zwieberge concentration camps===

The 8th liberated Halberstadt-Zwieberge, a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp, between 12 and 17 April 1945 during its drive through central Germany. The area around the city of Halberstadt housed a number of Buchenwald subcamps that had been established in 1944 to provide labor for the German war effort, including Halberstadt-Zwieberge I and Halberstadt-Zwieberge II. More than 5,000 inmates were incarcerated in these two subcamps, where they were forced to hollow out massive tunnels and build underground factories for Junkers Aircraft of Aircraft Motors Construction Company, which produced military aircraft.
Buchenwald administered at least 87 subcamps located across Germany, from Düsseldorf in the Rhineland to the border with the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in the east. Prisoners in the satellite camps were put to work mostly in armaments factories, in stone quarries, and on construction projects. Periodically, prisoners throughout the Buchenwald camp system underwent selection. The SS staff sent those too weak or disabled to continue working to the Bernburg or Sonnenstein killing centers, where they were killed by gas. Other weakened prisoners were killed by phenol injections administered by the camp doctor.

Of interest is that all details regarding the camp were sealed and classified by the US Government; presumably because of the camp&#x27;s involvement with an improved version of the V-1 flying bomb. In 1997, the information was declassified through the efforts of a former 8th Armored Division officer, Dr. Bernard Metrick. The records confirmed the role of the division in liberating the camp and the division&#x27;s flag was added to those on display at the U.S. Holocaust Museum honoring those who liberated the death camps.
The general end of hostilities unfortunately did not mean the end of casualties for the 8th Armored. On 1 May the 58th Inf. lost two men to snipers who had to be killed since they would not surrender. The next day the 58th Inf. lost an officer and three more men when a powder plant blew up in Munchshaf. Sabotage was suspected. It is believed that these were the last official wartime casualties of the division.

===Post war===
From 8 May through 30 May the division remained on occupation duty and continued to clean up stragglers and small pockets of resistance. On 30 May the division was assigned to Third Army. It was relieved by units of the British Army and began its move to the city of Pilsen in western Czechoslovakia. From 1 June through 19 September, many men were sent home under the point system. Those remaining were sent to various I &amp; E (Information and Education) training schools. Very little other training was done.

On 19 September the division began the trip to Camp Oklahoma City near Rheims, France, for deployment home. On 26 October the division traveled from Camp Oklahoma City to Camp Phillip Morris at Le Havre, France, and the division was officially dismounted. The division was inactivated on 13 November 1945 at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia by Gen. Charles F. Colson.

There is an official 8th Armored Division memorial at the American Cemetery in the city of Margraten, The Netherlands

==Armor==
The primary striking force of the Armored Division was the tank. The 8th was composed of 3 tank battalions:
*18th, 36th &amp; 80th Tank Battalions

Each battalion comprised approximately 80 tanks and was organized as a headquarters unit and 6 companies:
*a Headquarters Company,
*a Service Company and
*4 tank companies referred to as A, B, C and D companies

The headquarters unit was made up of the battalion command team and their vehicles; 3 M4A3 Sherman tanks (usually not used and held as a reserve) and various peeps (World War II US Armored divisions called the jeep a &#x27;peep&#x27;) and similar vehicles.

===Headquarters Company (HQ Co)===
The HQ Co was usually made up of:
*1 platoon of 3 M4A3 Sherman tanks
*1 platoon of 3 M4A3105 Sherman tanks.
**These were M4A3&#x27;s fitted with a 105 mm cannon and used as an assault gun.

===Service Company===
The Service Company contained special units like:
*Tank retrievers for recovering damaged tanks
*Tanks with plows and flails for clearing obstacles
*Medical Units

===Tank companies===

Companies A, B and C generally consisted of 17 medium tanks as follows:
*3 platoons of 5 M4A3 Sherman tanks
*1 M4A3 105 tank
*1 M4A3 tank for the company commander.

Company D consisted of 17 light tanks:
*3 platoons of 5 M5A1 Stuart tanks
*1 section of 2 M5A1 Stuart tanks
Shortly after arriving in Europe, the 8th swapped its M5A1 tanks for the newer, more powerful M24 Chaffee light tank.

The M4A3 76 were M4A3 Shermans tanks fitted with a more powerful 76 mm cannon. Later in the war, more M4A3 76 tanks were added to the tank companies as replacements for older or damaged units. The 8th, along with many of the other armored units arriving in Europe in late 1944, was equipped with all 76 mm armed Shermans. The M4A3E8 76 or &#x27;Easy Eight&#x27; version of the Sherman was also used by the 8th as it became available. In April 1945 the 8th began receiving the new M26 Pershing. None of the 8th Armored Pershing tanks engaged in combat before the close of hostilities.

==Armored infantry==
Early experience with armored warfare in the First World War made it clear that tanks could not fight in isolation. It was essential that tanks be supported by infantry. The Armored Infantry was developed to fill that role.

The 8th was composed of 3 armored infantry battalions:
*7th, 49th &amp; 58th Armored Infantry Battalions

Each battalion was organized as follows:
*A battalion headquarters Unit
*1 Headquarters Co (HQ Co)
*3 armored infantry companies referred to as A,B and C Companies
*1 Service Company

The battalion headquarters unit was made up of the battalion command team and their vehicles; 2 – 3 M2A1 or M3A1 Half-tracks and various jeeps or similar vehicles.

===Headquarters Company (HQ Co)===

The HQ Co was usually made up of:
*An HQ platoon comprising the battalion staff and their vehicles; 2 – 3 M3A1 Half-tracks and various jeeps or similar vehicles.
*A machine gun platoon with 6 M1917A1 Heavy Machine Guns, 3 M2 Heavy Machine guns, their crews (30 men total) and 3 M3A1 Half-tracks
*A mortar platoon with 3 M4 mortar carriers (made up of an 81mm mortar mounted in a M2A1 half-track and designed to fire over the rear of the vehicle) and their crews (30 men total)
*An assault gun platoon of 3 M4A3 105 tanks
*A Recon Platoon of 6 jeeps

===Rifle companies===
The battalion was made of 3 armored infantry companies: A, B and C which in turn were made up of:
*A Headquarters Platoon comprising the platoon staff and their vehicles: 2 M3A1 Half-tracks.
*3 Rifle platoons of 36 riflemen divided into 3 squads of 12, 2 M1919A4 medium Machine Guns and their crews, 1 60mm mortar and its crew and the platoon&#x27;s vehicles: 5 M3A1 Half-tracks.

===Service Company===
The Service Company was made up of:
*A Headquarters Platoon comprising the platoon staff and their vehicles: 2 M3A1Halftracks.
*An Anti-tank platoon with 9 bazooka rocket launchers, their crews (30 men in total) and their vehicles: 3 M3A1Halftracks.
*Medical units
*Other support units

Early in the war, the anti-tank platoon would have included a 37 mm anti-tank cannon but by the time the 8th entered combat in late 1944 the 37 mm was deemed ineffective against German armor and was discarded from the TO &amp; E.

The primary weapon of the armored infantryman was the M1 Garand rifle. Crew-served weapon crewmen were usually armed with the M1911A1 pistol or the M1 Carbine as a personal weapon. The armored infantrymen were not issued the Browning Automatic Rifle as each rifle platoon contained 2 M1919A4 medium machine guns as well as the 4 M1919A4&#x27;s and 1 M2 mounted on the platoon&#x27;s halftracks. These machine guns could be dismounted and used as needed.

==Armored field artillery==
The third side of the armored division&#x27;s offensive triangle was the armored field artillery. The 8th Armored Division included the:
*398th, 399th &amp; 405th Armored Field Artillery Battalions

Each battalion comprised 18 self-propelled cannon and supporting vehicles. The battalion was broken down into 5 batteries and usually organized as:
*1 Headquarters Battery
*3 firing batteries referred to as A, B and C Batteries
*1 Service Battery

===Headquarters Battery (HQ Bat)===
The HQ Bat was usually made up of:
*1 Command Section of 3 M3A1Halftracks and 1 ¼ Ton Truck
*2 observation sections of 1 M3A1Halftrack, 1 ¼ Ton truck and 1 Stinson L-5 
Observation Airplane each.
*3 M4A3 76 F.O. Forward Observer tanks, referenced as FO1, FO2 and FO3. These reported to the three armored artillery battalions, respectively. When not needed as direct observers, they were employed in their secondary roles as fighting tanks. Their crews reflected their FO role by the addition of an officer/observer who took command when not in an active tank combat situation.

===Firing battery===
Batteries A, B and C consisted of 6 self-propelled guns and supporting vehicles broken out as follows:
*2 sections of 3 M7 105 mm self-propelled guns and 3 M3A1Halftracks and 1 ¼ Ton Truck
*1 Headquarters Section with 1 M3A1Halftrack and 1 ¼ Ton Truck

===Support Battery===
The Support Battery comprised:
*1 Service Section with 1 2½ Ton Truck and 1 ¼ Ton Truck
*1 Medical Section

==Reconnaissance==
Reconnaissance in the armored divisions was performed by the Armored Reconnaissance Battalion in the old style heavy division or by the Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized in the light divisions such as the 8th.

These units were identical, except that the battalion was organized as companies, while the squadron as troops (although the light tank unit was a company in either organization).

*The 88th Armored Cavalry Recon Squadron served with the 8th Armored Division.
The squadron was organized in troops and equipped as follows:

===HQ Troop===
*10 Jeeps
*4 M8 Armored Cars

===Troops A, B, C &amp; D===
*12 M8 Armored Cars
*23 Jeeps

===Troop E===
*8 M8 HMC assault guns

===Company F===
*17 M5A1 tanks (Later M24 Chaffee)

Recon units were often supported by tank destroyer units, in the case of the 8th the 809th Tank Destroyer Battalion. The 809th used the M18 Hellcat 76 mm GMC.

<doc id="441237" wikidata="Q934504" url="?curid=441237" title="Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer of Wigmore">
<text>Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer of Wigmore (c. 1231 – 27 October 1282), of Wigmore Castle in Herefordshire, was a marcher lord who was a loyal ally of King Henry III of England and at times an enemy, at times an ally, of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales.

== Early career ==
Born in 1231, Roger was the son of Ralph de Mortimer and his Welsh wife, Gwladys Ddu, daughter of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and Joan Plantagenet, daughter of John, King of England.

In 1256 Roger went to war with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd when the latter invaded his lordship of Gwrtheyrnion or Rhayader. This war would continue intermittently until the deaths of both Roger and Llywelyn in 1282. They were both grandsons of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth.

Mortimer fought for the King against the rebel Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and almost lost his life in 1264 at the Battle of Lewes fighting Montfort&#x27;s men. In 1265 Mortimer&#x27;s wife, Maud de Braose helped rescue Prince Edward; and Mortimer and the Prince made an alliance against de Montfort.

== Victor at Evesham ==
In August 1265, de Montfort&#x27;s army was surrounded by the River Avon on three sides, and Prince Edward&#x27;s army on the fourth. Mortimer had sent his men to block the only possible escape route, at the Bengeworth bridge. The Battle of Evesham began in earnest. A storm roared above the battle field. Montfort&#x27;s Welsh soldiers broke and ran for the bridge, where they were slaughtered by Mortimer&#x27;s men. Mortimer himself killed Hugh Despencer and Montfort, and crushed Montfort&#x27;s army. Mortimer was awarded Montfort&#x27;s severed head and other parts of his anatomy, which he sent home to Wigmore Castle as a gift for his wife, Lady Mortimer.

==Welsh wars and death==

Llewellyn&#x27;s objections to Mortimer&#x27;s construction of a new castle Cefnllys contributed to the climate of distrust that preceded Edward I&#x27;s 1282 campaign. During the war, Mortimer was put in charge of operations in mid-Wales. It was a major setback for Edward when Mortimer died in October 1282.

== Marriage and children ==
His wife was Maud de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny by Eva Marshal. Roger Mortimer had married Maud in 1247. She was, like him, a scion of a Welsh Marches family. Their seven known children were:
# Ralph Mortimer, died 10 August 1274, Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire.
# Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer (1251–1304), married Margaret de Fiennes, the daughter of William II de Fiennes and Blanche de Brienne. Had issue, including Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March
# Isabella Mortimer, died 1292. She married (1) John Fitzalan (1246–1272), and (2) Robert de Hastang;
# Margaret Mortimer, died 1297. She married Robert de Vere, 6th Earl of Oxford
# Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer of Chirk, died 1326.
# Geoffrey Mortimer, died 1273.
# William Mortimer (c. 1259 – before June 1297), was hostage for his father in 1264. He was knighted, and married Hawise, daughter and heir of Robert de Mucegros. Died childless.

Their eldest son, Ralph, died in his youth. The second son, Edmund, was recalled from Oxford University and appointed his father&#x27;s heir.

== Epitaph ==
Roger Mortimer died on 27 October 1282 at Kingsland, Herefordshire, and was buried at Wigmore Abbey, where his tombstone read:
: Here lies buried, glittering with praise, Roger the pure, Roger Mortimer the second, called Lord of Wigmore by those who held him dear. While he lived all Wales feared his power, and given as a gift to him all Wales remained his. It knew his campaigns, he subjected it to torment.

<text>Friedrich Hartjenstein (3 July 1905 – 20 October 1954) was a German SS functionary and war criminal. A member of the SS-Totenkopfverbände, he served at various Nazi concentration camps such as Auschwitz and Sachsenhausen. After the Second World War, he was tried and found guilty of murder and crimes against humanity.

==Concentration camp officer==

Hartjenstein, who was born in Peine, began his SS work at Sachsenhausen in 1938. The following year, he was transferred to Niederhagen. In 1941, Hartjenstein served for a year with the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf, a Waffen SS combat division.

In 1942, he was appointed the commandant of Birkenau. It was the main camp at Auschwitz, and contained the extermination facilities and crematoria. In 1944, Hartjenstein was appointed commandant of Natzweiler concentration camp in France. In 1945, he worked at Flossenbürg concentration camp.

==Post-war trials==
Hartjenstein was arrested by the British and, on 6 June 1946, was sentenced to life imprisonment at Wuppertal for executing four female agents of the British clandestine Special Operations Executive organization. He was then tried for hanging a Royal Air Force POW, for which he was sentenced to death.

Hartjenstein was extradited to France, where he was tried for his crimes at Natzweiler, and received another death sentence. He died of a heart attack on 20 October 1954, aged 49, while awaiting execution in Paris.

<text>The 9th Armored Division (the &quot;Phantom Division&quot;) was an armored division of the United States Army during World War II. In honor of their World War II service, the 9th was officially nicknamed the &quot;Phantom Division.&quot;

The 9th Armored Division was cited for extraordinary heroism and gallantry in combat in the vicinity of Waldbillig and Savelborn, Luxembourg from 16–22 December 1944 during which they repulsed constant and determined attacks by an entire German division. Outnumbered five to one, with its infantry rifle companies surrounded for most of the time, clerks, cooks, mechanics, drivers and others manned the final defensive line. Supported by the outstandingly responsive and accurate fire of its artillery battalion, this widely dispersed force stopped every attack for six days until its surrounded infantry were ordered to fight their way back to them. This staunch defense disrupted the precise German attack schedule and thus gave time for the United States III and XII Corps to assemble unhindered and then launch the coordinated attack which raised the siege of Bastogne and contributed to saving much of Luxembourg and its capital from another German invasion. They were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their heroism.

==History==

===Predecessor units and early history===

The 3rd Cavalry Brigade, 15th Cavalry Division was constituted in the Regular Army on 29 August 1917 and was organized in December 1917 at Camp Harry J. Jones, Arizona. It was demobilized on 15 July 1919. Because of a reduced table of organization for the cavalry division developed after the war, the 3rd Cavalry Brigade became a part of the new 2nd Cavalry Division. On 15 July 1942, the 9th Armored Division, under the command of Major General Geoffrey Keyes, was activated at Fort Riley, Kansas, by reorganizing and redesignating the white elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division. This was only seven months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which was followed just four days later by the German declaration of war on the United States, thus bringing the United States into World War II. Headquarters, 3rd Cavalry Brigade was converted, reorganized, and redesignated as Headquarters, 9th Armored Division Trains. The 2nd and 14th Cavalry Regiments were inactivated and the personnel and equipment were transferred to the new 2nd and 14th Armored Regiments, respectively.

The regiments underwent changes during the war as follows:

* 2nd Armored Regiment reorganized and redesignated 9 October 1943:
** Headquarters, Headquarters Company, and 2nd Battalion reorganized and redesignated as 2nd Tank Battalion, 9th Armored Division. 
** 1st Battalion reorganized and redesignated as 776th Tank Battalion and relieved from assignment to the 9th Armored Division.
** 3rd Battalion reorganized and redesignated as 19th Tank Battalion, 9th Armored Division.
** Reconnaissance Company reorganized and redesignated as Troop D, 89th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, 9th Armored Division.
** Band, Maintenance Company, and Service Company disbanded. 

* 14th Armored Regiment reorganized and redesignated 9 October 1943:
** Headquarters, Headquarters Company, and 1st and 2nd Battalions reorganized and redesignated as 14th Tank Battalion, 9th Armored Division.
** 3rd Battalion reorganized and redesignated as 711th Tank Battalion and relieved from assignment to the 9th Armored Division.
** Reconnaissance Company reorganized and redesignated as Troop E, 89th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, 9th Armored Division.
** Band, Maintenance Company, and Service Company disbanded.

The lineages of the 2nd and 14th Cavalry Regiments were continued when these inactive units, having given up their personnel and equipment, were later reorganized and redesignated as cavalry reconnaissance squadrons and reactivated in 1943.

After over two years of training throughout the country, including Camp Ibis, the 9th Armored Division, now commanded by Major General John W. Leonard, reached the United Kingdom in September 1944.

===Fortitude===
The 9th Armored Division was one of several real U.S. Army divisions that participated in Operation Fortitude, the deception operation mounted by the Allies to deceive the Germans about the real landing site for Operation Neptune, the amphibious invasion of Northern France. The 9th was assigned to a camp on the British coastline opposite of the German defenses in Pas-de-Calais, ostensibly as part of the &quot;First US Army Group&quot; (FUSAG) under Major General John W. Leonard.

===Combat chronicle===

The 9th Armored Division landed in Normandy late in September 1944, and first went into line, 23 October 1944, on patrol duty in a quiet sector along the Luxembourg-German frontier. When the Germans launched their winter offensive on 16 December 1944, the 9th, with no real combat experience, suddenly found itself engaged in heavy fighting. The Division saw its severest action at St. Vith, Echternach, and Bastogne, its units fighting in widely separated areas.

Its stand at Bastogne held off the Germans long enough to enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for a defense of the city. After a rest period in January 1945, the Division prepared to drive across the Roer River. The offensive was launched on 28 February 1945 and the 9th crossed the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. 

&quot;Here, on the Ludendorf Bridge crossing the Rhine at Remagen, Combat Command B, 9th Armored Division -- headed by the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion -- with &#x27;superb skill, daring and esprit de corps&#x27; successfully effected the first bridgehead across Germany&#x27;s formidable river barrier and so contributed decisively to the defeat of the enemy. The 27th Battalion reached Remagen, found the bridge intact but mined for demolition. Although its destruction was imminent, without hesitation and in face of heavy fire the infantrymen rushed across the structure, and with energy and skill seized the surrounding high ground. The entire episode illustrates that high degree of initiative, leadership and gallantry toward which all armies strive but too rarely attain, and won for the Combat Command the Distinguished Unit Citation.&quot;

On 7 March 1945, elements of the 9th Armored captured the Ludendorff Bridge when German demolition charges failed to bring the bridge down. Soldiers scrambled under the bridge, swinging from girder to girder, tossing demolition charges into the Rhine, fearing the chargers could explode at any time. Capturing the bridge may have shortened the war by weeks to months and saved tens of thousands of lives.

The Division exploited the bridgehead, moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg, where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated from Stalag XIIA. The Division drove on to Frankfurt and then turned to assist in the closing of the Ruhr Pocket. In April it continued east, encircling Leipzig and securing a line along the Mulde River. The Division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on 9 May 1945.

The 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, was constituted on 29 August 1917 and organized as Headquarters, 3rd Brigade, 15th Cavalry Division in December. The 3rd Brigade demobilized on 15 July 1919 and reconstituted on 10 August 1921, within the newly constituted 1st Cavalry Division. Although never officially reorganized, the Brigade was inactive until its 15 October 1940 activation and redesignation and conversion to HHC, 9th Armored Division Trains, and deployed to Europe, receiving campaign-participation credit for operations in the Rhineland, the Ardennes-Alsace, and the Central Europe theatres of war, and awarded two Meritorious Unit Commendations, with embroidered streamers reading: &quot;Europe 1944&quot; and &quot;Europe 1945&quot;.

== Inactivation ==
After World War II, the unit returned state-side. The division was inactivated on 13 October 1945, and reactivated on 15 July 1963, when it was reassigned from the 9th Armored Division, and converted and redesignated as HHC, 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (United States).

<text>Aimeric or Aimery de Peguilhan, Peguillan, or Pégulhan (c. 1170 – c. 1230) was a troubadour (fl. 1190–1221) born in Peguilhan (near Saint-Gaudens), the son of a cloth merchant.

Aimeric&#x27;s first patron was Raimon V of Toulouse, followed by his son Raimon VI. However, he fled the region at the threat of the Albigensian Crusade and spent some time in Spain and ten years in Lombardy. It is said that he had secretly loved a neighbour while living in Toulouse, and that it was for her that he returned.

Aimeric is known to have composed at least fifty works, the music for six of which survives:
*&quot;
*&quot;
*&quot;

Most of his works were bland &quot;cansos&quot; with a few &quot;tensos&quot; (with Sordello and Albertet de Sestaro).

<text>The 10th Armored Division (nicknamed &quot;Tiger Division&quot;) was an armored division of the United States Army in World War II. In the European Theater of Operations the 10th Armored Division was part of both the Twelfth United States Army Group and Sixth United States Army Group. Originally assigned to the Third United States Army under General George S. Patton, it saw action with the Seventh United States Army under General Alexander Patch near the conclusion of the war.

The 10th Armored Division was inactivated on 13 October 1945 at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia. On 25 February 1953, the division was allotted to the Regular Army but remained inactive.

==History==

The division was activated on 15 July 1942, at Fort Benning, Georgia, around a nucleus of the reorganized and redesignated 3rd and 11th Cavalry Regiments.

===Nickname===
The &quot;Tiger&quot; nickname of the 10th originates from a division-wide contest held while it was training in the United States, symbolizing the division &quot;clawing and mauling&quot; its way through the enemy. Major General Paul Newgarden, the division&#x27;s first commander selected &quot;Tiger&quot; as the winner because a tiger has soldierly qualities, including being clean and neat and the ability to maneuver and surprise his prey.

===Combat chronicle===
The 10th Armored Division entered France through the port of Cherbourg-en-Cotentin, 23 September 1944, and put in a month of training at Teurtheville, France, before entering combat, as part of the Third Army under General George S. Patton. Leaving Teurtheville, 25 October, the Division moved to Mars-la-Tour, where it entered combat, 2 November, in support of the XX Corps, containing enemy troops in the area. Later that month, the 10th participated in the capture of Metz. After fierce fighting, the 10th moved to the Siegfried Line and led the Third Army into Germany on 19 November 1944.

====Bastogne====

Combat Command-B&#x27;s lead Sherman tanks, tank destroyers and half-tracks entered Bastogne 18 December 1944. These were the first combat troops to reach the threatened town. CCB&#x27;s commander, Col. William L. Roberts, split his command to form a crescent-shaped arc facing eastward five miles from the city. A task force commanded by Maj. William R. Desobry went north to Noville, while a similar group under Lt. Col. Henry T. Cherry wheeled east to Longvilly. Lt. Col. James O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s group shifted southeast to Bras.

At the same time, German forces moved westward with increasing momentum. Bastogne, a hub from which seven main roads diverged, was essential to the swift movement of Rundstedt&#x27;s panzers. Before dawn of 19 December five German divisions attacked CCB. Bazooka-armed American soldiers and a single platoon of tank destroyers fought a column of German Panzer IV tanks on the Houffalize-Noville highway, turning them back. More enemy armor followed and with the road blocked, the battle spilled into the snow-covered fields and woods. For eight hours, CCB alone withstood multiple German attacks before reinforcements arrived from the 101st Airborne Division, which had moved into Bastogne under the screen of the 10th&#x27;s actions.

The Germans still maintained an advantage and the outnumbered Americans withdrew closer to Bastogne. The Germans sent pincers to the north and south. The night of 21 December, the pincers met and closed west of the city. In the surrounded city, the 10th assembled a mobile reserve force to strike in any direction.

CCB endured the cold, artillery barrages and bombing while their supplies and ammunition dwindled. Fourth Armored Division tanks finally broke through on 26 December, but CCB continued to fight until 18 January.
After the battle, the 10th Armored Division&#x27;s 21st Tank Battalion and Combat Command B were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their actions from 17 to 27 December 1944 Battle of the Bulge. The 101 Airborne Division was also honored with the Presidential Unit Citation for their actions at Bastogne. Years after the war, General Anthony McAuliffe said &quot;In my opinion, Combat Command B of the 10th Armored Division was never properly credited with their important role in the Bastogne battle.&quot;

====Across the Saar====
In early February 1945, the 10th reassembled at Metz and was able to rest briefly after rejoining the XX Corps. On 20 February 1945, the 10th again attacked the German defenses. In one day, they broke the German lines, and after 48 hours, the division advanced 85 miles, overran the Saar-Moselle Triangle, and reached the Saar River. The 10th then crossed the Saar and captured Trier and a bridge across the Moselle River. The loss of this heavily defended city caused German defenses to collapse. Generals Dwight Eisenhower and Patton visited the 10th Armored Division to congratulate them.

The division raced through Kaiserslautern, crossed the Rhine River on 28 March 1945, and continued east. The division helped to seize Heilbronn, defended the Crailsheim Salient, and moved south to isolate Stuttgart. As part of the VI Corps the 10th crossed the Danube River on 23 April 1945. By 27 April 1945 it was one of several Seventh Army corps headed towards the Alps to seal off passes out of Germany, reaching Innsbruck, Austria by early May. By 9 May 1945, elements of the 10th had reached Mittenwald, Bavaria, where they halted. The 10th occupied southern Bavaria until September 1945. On 3 October 1945, the division sailed from Marseilles, France. It arrived at Newport News, Virginia on 13 October 1945 and was inactivated at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia on the same day. The 10th Armored Division had captured 650 towns and cities along with 56,000 German prisoners. 

In one week, the 10th advanced 100 miles and captured 8,000 prisoners from 26 different enemy divisions. After a four-day respite, the 10th was one of several divisions spearheading the Seventh Army drive under General Alexander Patch into Bavaria. With rapid night movements, the &quot;Tigers&quot; continually surprised the Germans. German dispatches referred to the 10th as the &quot;Ghost Division.&quot; As it drove into Bavaria, the division overran one of the many subcamps of Dachau concentration camp in the Landsberg area on 27 April 1945, earning it recognition as a liberating unit.

<doc id="441249" wikidata="Q698111" url="?curid=441249" title="Fitzcarraldo">
<text>Fitzcarraldo () is a 1982 West German epic adventure-drama film written, produced, and directed by Werner Herzog, and starring Klaus Kinski as would-be rubber baron Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, an Irishman known in Peru as Fitzcarraldo, who is determined to transport a steamship over the Andes mountains to access a rich rubber territory in the Amazon basin. The character was inspired by Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fitzcarrald, who once transported a disassembled steamboat over the Isthmus of Fitzcarrald.

The film had a troubled production, chronicled in the documentary &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot; (1982). Herzog had his crew attempt to manually haul the 320-ton steamship up a steep hill, leading to three injuries. The film&#x27;s original star Jason Robards became sick halfway through filming, so Herzog hired Kinski, with whom he had previously clashed violently during production of &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972), &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (1979), and &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (1979). Their fourth collaboration fared no better. When shooting was nearly complete, the chief of the Machiguenga tribe, whose members were used extensively as extras, asked Herzog if they should kill Kinski for him. Herzog declined.

==Plot==
In the early part of the 20th century, Iquitos, Peru, a small city east of the Andes in the Amazon basin, is experiencing rapid growth due to a rubber boom, and many Europeans and North African Sephardic Jewish immigrants are settling in the city, bringing their cultures with them. One immigrant, an Irishman named Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (known by the locals as &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;), is a lover of opera and a great fan of the internationally-renowned Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. He dreams of building an opera house in Iquitos, but, although he has an indomitable spirit, he has little capital. The Peruvian government has parceled up the areas in the Amazon basin known to contain rubber trees. However, the best parcels having already been leased to private companies for exploitation, Fitzcarraldo has been trying and failing to make the money to bring opera to Iquitos by various other means, including an ambitious attempt to construct a Trans-Andean Railway.

A rubber baron shows Fitzcarraldo a map and explains that, while the only remaining unclaimed parcel in the area is on the Ucayali River, a major tributary of the Amazon, it is cut off from the Amazon (and access to Atlantic ports) by a lengthy section of rapids. Fitzcarraldo notices that the Pachitea River, another Amazon tributary, comes within several hundred meters of the Ucayali upstream of the parcel. He leases the inaccessible parcel from the government, and his paramour, Molly, a successful brothel owner, funds his purchase of an old steamship, which he christens the SS &quot;Molly Aida&quot;, from the rubber baron. After fixing up the boat, Fitzcarraldo recruits a crew and takes off up the Pachitea, which is largely unexplored because of the hostile indigenous people who live on its banks.

Fitzcarraldo intends to go to the closest point between the Ucayali and the Pachitea, pull his three-deck, 320-ton steamship up the muddy 40° hillside, and portage it from one river to the next. He plans to use the ship to collect rubber harvested along the upper Ucayali and then transport the rubber over to the Pachitea and, on different ships, down to market at Atlantic ports.

Soon after they enter indigenous territory, the majority of Fitzcarraldo&#x27;s crew, who are unaware of his full plan, abandon the expedition, leaving only the captain, engineer, and cook. The natives are impressed by the steamship and, once they make contact, agree to help Fitzcarraldo without asking many questions. After months of work and great struggles, they successfully pull the ship over the mountain using a complex system of pulleys and aided by the ship&#x27;s anchor windlass. The crew falls asleep after a drunken celebration, and the chief of the natives severs the rope securing the ship to the shore. Fitzcarraldo awakens as the boat is going through the Pongo of Mainique, and is unable to stop it. The ship does not sustain any major damage, but Fitzcarraldo is forced to abandon his quest. Before returning to Iquitos, he learns that the natives helped him move the ship so they could attempt to appease the river gods by shooting the rapids in the enormous ship.

Despondent, Fitzcarraldo sells the steamship back to the rubber baron, but there is time before the title changes hands for him to send for a European opera company that he hears is in Manaus. Lacking an opera house, they construct their sets on the deck of the ship, and the entire city of Iquitos comes down to the riverbank to watch as Fitzcarraldo floats it by, managing to bring opera to the city after all.

==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; is considered one of the most difficult productions in the history of cinema.

The story was inspired by the historical figure of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald. In the 1890s, Fitzcarrald arranged for the transport of a steamship across an isthmus from one river into another, but it weighed only 30 tons (rather than over 300), and was carried over in pieces to be reassembled at its destination.

In his autobiographical film &quot;Portrait Werner Herzog&quot; (1986), Herzog said that he concentrated in &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; on the physical effort of transporting the ship, partly inspired by the engineering feats of ancient standing stones. The film production was an incredible ordeal, and famously involved moving a 320-ton steamship over a hill. This was filmed without the use of special effects. Herzog believed that no one had ever performed a similar feat in history, and likely never will again, calling himself &quot;Conquistador of the Useless&quot;. Three similar-looking ships were bought for the production and used in different scenes and locations, including scenes that were shot aboard the ship while it crashed through rapids. The most violent scenes in the rapids were shot with a model of the ship. Three of the six people involved in the filming of this sequence were injured.

Jason Robards was originally cast in the title role, but he became ill with dysentery after completing forty percent of the film and was subsequently forbidden by his doctors to return to Peru to finish. Herzog considered replacing Robards with Jack Nicholson, or playing Fitzcarraldo himself, before Klaus Kinski, with whom Herzog had worked on three previous films, accepted the role. Due to the delay in production, Mario Adorf was no longer available to play the role of the ship&#x27;s captain, which was recast, and Mick Jagger had to leave to tour with the Rolling Stones, so Herzog wrote the character of Fitzcarraldo&#x27;s assistant Wilbur out of the script.

Kinski displayed erratic behavior throughout the production and fought virulently with Herzog and other members of the crew. A scene from Herzog&#x27;s documentary about the actor, &quot;My Best Fiend&quot; (1999), shows Kinski raging at production manager Walter Saxer over such matters as the quality of the food. Herzog has noted that the native extras were greatly upset by the actor&#x27;s behavior, while Kinski claimed to feel close to them. In &quot;My Best Fiend&quot;, Herzog says that one of the native chiefs offered, in all seriousness, to kill Kinski for him, but that he declined because he needed the actor to complete filming. According to Herzog, he exploited these tensions. For example, in a scene in which the ship&#x27;s crew is eating dinner while surrounded by the natives, the clamor the chief incites over Fitzcarraldo was inspired by actual hatred of Kinski.

Locations used in the film include: Manaus, Brazil; Iquitos, Peru; Pongo de Mainique, Peru; and an isthmus between the Urubamba and the Camisea rivers in Peru (at -11.737294,-72.934542, 36 miles west of the actual Isthmus of Fitzcarrald).

Herzog&#x27;s first version of the story was published as &quot;Fitzcarraldo: The Original Story&quot; (1982) by Fjord Press (). He made alterations while writing the screenplay.

===Deaths, injuries and accusations of exploitation===
The production was affected by numerous injuries and the deaths of several indigenous extras who were hired to work on the film as laborers. Two small plane crashes occurred during the film&#x27;s production, which resulted in a number of injuries, including one case of paralysis. Another incident involved a local Peruvian logger who, after being bitten by a venomous snake, amputated his own foot with a chainsaw so as to prevent the spread of the venom, thus saving his life.

Herzog has been accused of exploiting indigenous people during the making of the film, and comparisons have been made between Herzog and Fitzcarraldo himself. In 1982, Michael F. Brown, now a professor of anthropology at Williams College, claimed in the magazine &quot;The Progressive&quot; that, while Herzog originally got along with the Aguaruna people, some of whom were hired as extras and laborers, relations deteriorated when Herzog began the construction of a village on Aguaruna land. He allegedly failed to consult the tribal council and attempted to obtain protection from the local militia when the tribe turned violent. Aguaruna men burned down the film set in December 1979, reportedly careful to avoid casualties, and it took Herzog many months to find another suitable location.

==Music==
The soundtrack album (released in 1982) contains music by Popol Vuh, taken from the albums &quot;Die Nacht der Seele&quot; (1979) and &quot;Sei still, wisse ich bin&quot; (1981), as well as performances by Enrico Caruso and others. The film uses excerpts from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot;, Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (&quot;Ridi, Pagliaccio&quot;), Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot;, and Strauss&#x27; &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot;.

==Reception==

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four (out of four) stars in his original 1982 review, and he added it to his &quot;Great Movie&quot; collection in 2005. Ebert compared &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; to films like &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979) and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), noting that &quot;we are always aware both of the film, and of the making of the film&quot;, and concluding that &quot;[t]he movie is imperfect, but transcendent&quot;.

Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; as one of his favorite films.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 75% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating based on 32 reviews, with an average score of 7.5 out of 10.

==Awards==
&quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; won the German Film Prize in Silver for Best Feature Film. It was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Film, the Palme d&#x27;Or award of the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Herzog won the award for Best Director at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. The film was selected as the West German entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 55th Academy Awards, but did not make the final shortlist of five nominees.

==Related works==
Les Blank&#x27;s documentary &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot; (1982), filmed during the production of &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, documents its many hardships. Blank&#x27;s work contains some of the only surviving footage of Robards&#x27; and Jagger&#x27;s performances in the early filming of &quot;Fitzcarraldo.&quot; Herzog later used portions of this work in his documentaries: &quot;Portrait Werner Herzog&quot; (1986) and &quot;My Best Fiend&quot; (1999). &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot; has many scenes documenting the arduous transport of the ship over the mountain.

Herzog&#x27;s personal diaries from the production were published in 2004 as the book &quot;Conquest of the Useless&quot;. The book includes an epilogue with Herzog&#x27;s views on the Peruvian jungle 20 years later.

==References==
In her 1983 parody &quot;From the Diary of Werner Herzog&quot; in &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, Cathleen Schine describes the history of a fictitious film, &quot;Fritz: Commuter&quot;, as &quot;a nightmarish tale of a German businessman obsessed with bringing professional hockey to Westport, Connecticut&quot;.

Glen Hansard wrote a song entitled &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, which appears on The Frames&#x27; 1995 album of the same name. On their live album &quot;Set List&quot;, Hansard says that Herzog&#x27;s film inspired this song.

The film is referred to in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;On a Clear Day I Can&#x27;t See My Sister&quot; (2005), in which the students are forced to pull their bus up a mountain. Üter complains, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m Fitzcarraldo!&quot;, and Nelson replies, &quot;That movie was flawed!&quot;, punching Üter in the stomach. The title of a later episode of the series, &quot;Fatzcarraldo&quot; (2017), references the title of the film and also parodies aspects of its plot.

<text>The 11th Armored Division (11 AD) was a division of the United States Army in World War II. It was activated on 15 August 1942 at Camp Polk, Louisiana and moved on 24 June 1943 for the Louisiana Maneuvers. Transferred then to Camp Barkeley, Texas on 5 September 1943, the division participated, beginning 29 October 1943, in the California Maneuvers and arrived at Camp Cooke California on 11 February 1944. The division staged at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey from 16 to 29 September 1944 until departing New York Port of Embarkation on 29 September 1944, arriving in England on 11 October 1944.

The 11 AD landed in France on 16 December 1944, crossed into Belgium on 29 December, and entered Germany on 5 March 1945. The 11th Armored Division was disbanded in August 1945.

==Commanders==
Commanders of the 11th Armored Division were:

*Major General Edward H. Brooks, August 1942 – March 1944
*Brigadier General Charles S. Kilburn, March 1944 – March 1945
*Brigadier General (later Major General) Holmes E. Dager, March 1945 – May 1945

==Combat chronicle==
The division was activated on 15 August 1942. It arrived in England 11 October 1944 and prepared for combat with two months&#x27; training in the Salisbury Plain Training Area. The division landed in Normandy on 16 December 1944, assigned to contain the enemy in the Lorient Pocket, but the onset of the Battle of the Bulge resulted in a forced march to the Meuse and the defense of a 30-mile sector from Givet to Sedan, 23 December. Launching an attack from Neufchâteau, Belgium, 30 December, the 11th defended the highway to Bastogne against fierce assault.

An eyewitness account by John Fague of B Company, 21st Armored Infantry Battalion of the 11th Armored Division, describes the killing of 80 German prisoners by American soldiers at the Chenogne massacre &quot;Machine guns were being set up. These boys were to be machine gunned and murdered. We were committing the same crimes we were now accusing the Japanese and Germans of doing&quot;.

The division acted as spearhead of a wedge into the enemy line, and its junction with the First Army at Houffalize, Belgium, 16 January 1945, created a huge trap. After the liquidation of the Bulge, the Siegfried Line was pierced, Lützkampen falling 7 February, Grosskampenberg on the 17th, and the key point, Roscheid, 20 February.

After a brief rest, the division crossed the Prum and Kyll Rivers, taking Gerolstein and Nieder Bettingen against violent opposition. Andernach and Brohl fell 9 March, in the sweep to the Rhine. In the swing southward to clear the Saar-Moselle-Rhine pocket, the Moselle River was crossed at Bullay and the Worms Airport captured, 21 March.

After rest and maintenance, the division drove across the Rhine at Oppenheim, took Hanau and Fulda, and headed for the Thuringian Forest, reaching Oberhof, 3 April. The offensive raced through Bavaria, Coburg falling on the 10th, Bayreuth on the 14th.

In the final drive, the division crossed the Regen river, 24 April, overran Grafenau and Freyung, and plunged toward the Danube, seizing Rohrbach, Neufelden, and Zwettl. The enemy put up its last significant resistance along the approaches to Linz, Austria, but the 11th entered that city, 5 May. Pushing onward, elements contacted Soviet forces, 8 May, the first unit of the Third Army, to meet the Soviet Red Army.
On 5 May 1945, elements of the division liberated the Mauthausen concentration camp.

The war in Europe officially ended on V-E Day, 8 May, with a separate Soviet surrender the next day. The division was placed on occupational duty until it was disbanded on 31 August 1945.

<doc id="441252" wikidata="Q1740505" url="?curid=441252" title="Norman Garstin">
<text>Norman Garstin (28 August 1847 – 22 June 1926) was an Irish artist, teacher, art critic and journalist associated with the Newlyn School of painters. After completing his studies in Antwerp and Paris, Garstin travelled around Europe and painted some of his first professional paintings while on the journey. He later took students to Europe to some of his favourite places.

Garstin painted &quot;plein air&quot; and was influenced by Impressionism, Japanese works and James McNeill Whistler. Some of his works are at Tate and Penlee House. Garstin was a founding member of the Newlyn Art Gallery. His daughter, Alethea, was also a Newlyn School artist.

==Personal life==
He was born 28 August 1847 in Caherconlish, County Limerick, Ireland to Captain William Garstin and Mary Moore Garstin. He was raised by aunts and grandparents following his father&#x27;s suicide and his mother&#x27;s incapacitating disabilities.

Garstin attended Victoria College on the island of Jersey and then he worked in architecture and engineering for brief periods. He then travelled to South Africa where he befriended Cecil Rhodes, worked as a journalist and was involved in government in Cape Town.

Pursuing an interest in art, Garstin trained in 1880 in Antwerp at the Royal Academy. From 1882 to 1884 he studied in Paris at an academy founded by Carolus-Duran. He then travelled and painted his way through Spain, Morocco and Venice, Italy.

In 1886, he married Louisa Jones, also known as Dochie. Many of Garstin&#x27;s friends from school in Antwerp had settled in Newlyn; Garstin and Dochie moved to Mount Vernon in Newlyn by 1886. They had three children: Crosbie, Denis and Alethea. The boys took up journalism and Alethea became an artist. The family moved to Penzance by 1895.

On 22 June 1926, Garstin died in Penzance.

==Career==
Garstin worked as a painter, teacher, art critic and journalist. As printed in &quot;100 Years in Newlyn&quot;, Norman Garstin was:
He was a man of intensely individual impulses and opinions, and incurred unpopularity at times through his views on war and other topics. But he was a stimulating teacher and a shrewd critic, and had a true eye for a picture with old architecture and historic atmosphere, as well as a brush capable of rendering his intentions with right effect.

In 1888 he became a member of the New English Art Club (NEAC). Garstin became a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists (NSA) and was on the Newlyn Art Gallery&#x27;s Provisional Committee for its opening in 1895. Garstin said of the plein-air approach used by St Ives and Newlyn artists: They were &quot;filled with this idea of a fresh unarranged nature to be studied in her fields, and by her streams, and on the margin of her great seas – in these things they were to find the motives of their art.&quot;

He was a teacher and took groups to &quot;his favorite painting haunts on the Continent.&quot; For instance, Frances Hodgkins, a New Zealand artist, attended Garstin&#x27;s 1901 and 1902 summer sketching classes in France. He taught Harold Harvey, the only Cornish Newlyn School painter, and his daughter, Alethea.

==Works==
His work consisted primarily of small oil panels in the &quot;plein air&quot; style, something he had picked up from the French Impressionists, like Manet. He was also fascinated by Japanese prints and admired the work of the American painter James McNeill Whistler.

One of his best and most famous works is his 1889 painting &quot;The Rain, it raineth every day&quot; of the Penzance promenade. The title of the work comes from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night.&quot; &quot;The composition of this painting demonstrates Garstin&#x27;s admiration for Japanese art,&quot; says Penlee House.

<text>The 12th Armored Division was an armored division of the United States Army in World War II. It fought in the European Theater of Operations in France, Germany and Austria, between November 1944 and May 1945.

The German Army called the 12th Armored Division the &quot;Suicide Division&quot; for its fierce defensive actions during Operation Nordwind in France, and they were nicknamed the &quot;Mystery Division&quot; when they were temporarily transferred to the command of the Third Army under General George S. Patton Jr., to cross the Rhine River.

The 12th Armored Division was one of only ten U.S. divisions (and only one of two U.S. armored divisions) during World War II that had African-American combat companies integrated into the division. The group was known as Company D. One of the African American soldiers, Staff Sergeant Edward A. Carter Jr. was awarded The Distinguished Service Cross for gallantry in combat during World War II, and was later awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously.

==History==
The 12th Armored Division was activated on 15 September 1942. Organization and initial training was at Camp Campbell, Kentucky, and continued at Camp Barkeley in Abilene, Texas. The division consisted of approximately 11,000 soldiers, and was composed of tank, field artillery, motorized infantry battalions and other support units.

In early 1943 the division adopted the nickname &quot;The Hellcats&quot;, symbolizing its toughness and readiness for combat.

While at Camp Barkeley, the 44th Tank Battalion was sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations on a special mission and later distinguished itself as the first unit to enter Manila. The 44th was replaced by the 714th Tank Battalion.

Walt Disney himself designed a logo for the 714th Tank Battalion.

===Origin of Combat Units===
The 12th was originally organized as a heavy armored division with two armored regiments, the 43rd and 44th, and one armored infantry regiment, the 56th Armored Infantry Regiment. In 1943, it was reorganized from a heavy division to a light division as part of a general streamlining of all armored divisions, except the 2nd Armored Division and the 3rd Armored Division.

====Tank Battalions====
The original 43rd and 44th Armored Regiments assigned to the 12th AD were re-designated to become the 23rd, 43rd, 44th, 714th and 779th Tank Battalions during the reorganization the division underwent while at the Tennessee Maneuver Area in Watertown, Tennessee, in November 1943. The 714th Tank Battalion was sent to Fort Jackson, SC and the 779th Tank Battalion went to Fort Knox, KY as separate tank battalions. The 44th Tank Battalion was detached from the 12th AD and sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations, where it distinguished itself as the first tank battalion to enter the city of Manila and liberated American and Allied civilian prisoners interred in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. It was replaced by the 714th Tank Battalion, which rejoined the 12th AD in November 1943. The 779th Tank Battalion was sent to the Philippines late in the war, but did not see any combat action.

====Armored Infantry Battalions====
The 56th Armored Infantry Regiment (AIR) traced its historical origin back to the 17th Infantry Regiment of Maj. Gen. George Sykes&#x27; 2nd Division of the 5th Army Corps, of the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War. During World War I, soldiers from the reconstituted 17th Infantry Regiment were used to form the 56th Infantry Regiment on 15 May 1917, which was involved in the battle around Metz in Alsace-Lorraine. On 7 July 1942, the unit was reactivated as the 56th Armored Infantry Regiment and assigned to the 12th Armored Division, which was activated as a division at Camp Campbell, KY on 15 September 1942. On 11 November 1943 while at Watertown, Tennessee, the 12th Armored Division was reorganized and the 56th Armored Infantry Regiment was reorganized to form the 17th, 56th and 66th Armored Infantry Battalions (AIB).
The 1st Battalion of the 56th AIR became the 66th AIB and the 2nd Battalion of the 56th AIR became the 17th AIB of the 12th Armored Division. The 3rd Battalion of the 56th AIR became the 56th AIB. Companies G, H and I of the 56th AIR became Companies A, B and C of the 56th AIB.
The reconstituted 56th Armored Infantry Battalion saw service in the European Theatre during World War II, beginning back in the Alsace-Lorraine as an element of the 12th Armored Division fighting in 1944–1945 to liberate the same region of France from Nazi occupation as the 56th Armored Infantry Regiment had in World War I.

===World War II===
====Combat chronicle====
After completing training the division left Abilene and departed from Camp Shanks, New York, for the European Theater of Operations on 20 September 1944. It landed at Liverpool, England on 2 October 1944. While awaiting replacement armor which had been borrowed by the U.S. Third Army, the 12th was sent to Tidworth Barracks in Wiltshire, UK. It crossed the English Channel from Southampton, arrived at Le Havre, France, on 11 November 1944 and then traveled up the Seine River to Rouen to join the Seventh Army under Lieutenant General Alexander Patch. Advance elements met the enemy near Weisslingen in Alsace on 5 December, and the entire division moved against the Maginot Line fortifications two days later.

In its advance, Rohrbach-lès-Bitche and towns surrounding Bettviller were liberated by 12 December 1944, and Utweiler, Germany was seized on 21 December. After a short period of rehabilitation and maintenance, the 12th rolled against the Rhine bridgehead at Herrlisheim that the Germans had established as part of their Operation Nordwind offensive. In order to seal the Battle of the Bulge, units of the Seventh Army were diverted north to assist the Third Army in capturing Bastogne. Due to this, the remainder of the Seventh Army, including the 12th Armored Division, was stretched thin holding a long front line with only eight divisions.

German defenders repulsed two division attacks in the most violent combat in the history of the division, during 8 to 10 January and 16 to 17 January 1945. The division&#x27;s attacks at Herrlisheim failed to use combined-arms tactics and were defeated in detail, resulting in two tank and two armored infantry battalions taking heavy losses. Poor tactics were compounded by terrain that was almost tabletop-flat, offering the German defenders excellent fields of fire. However, enemy counterattacks also failed, in part because of the firm leadership of the commander of Combat Command B, Colonel Charles Bromley, who declared his headquarters expendable and ordered all personnel in the headquarters to prepare a hasty defense.

The division was subsequently relieved by the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The 12th Armored Division suffered over 1,700 battle casualties during the fighting in and around Herrlisheim. As a consequence, when African-American soldiers who were in non-combat positions were able to volunteer to become combat troops, Major General Roderick R. Allen was one of only ten division commanders who allowed them to join the combat ranks. After recovering from the bruising experience at Herrlisheim, the 12th went over to the offensive and attacked south from Colmar, after being assigned to the French First Army under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. In a lightning drive, the 12th effected junction with French forces at Rouffach, on 5 February, sealing the Colmar Pocket and ending German resistance in the Vosges Mountains. Except for elements acting as a protective screen, the division withdrew to the St. Avold area for rest and rehabilitation. The division was attached to the Third Army under General George S. Patton Jr. from 17 March 1945 through its crossing of the Rhine on 28 March. The soldiers were ordered to remove their identifying unit insignias, and vehicle markings were painted over, disguising the fact that Patton had an additional armored division under his command. Thus the 12th was given the nickname the &quot;Mystery Division&quot;. The attack resumed on 18 March 1945.

In a quick drive to the Rhine, Ludwigshafen fell on 21 March, and two other important river cities, Speyer and Germersheim, were secured on 24 March, clearing the Saar Palatinate. Maintaining the rapid pace, the 12th crossed the Rhine River at Worms on 28 March over pontoon bridges, advanced toward Würzburg, and captured that city along with elements of the famed 42nd Infantry Division (United States). After assisting in the seizure of Schweinfurt, the division continued toward Nuremberg on 13 April, taking Neustadt, then shifted south toward Munich on 17 April. Elements of the 12th raced from Dinkelsbühl to the Danube, where they found the bridge at Lauingen had been blown. Moving quickly they captured the bridge at Dillingen intact before demolition men could destroy it. This bridge provided a vital artery for Allied troops flooding into southern Bavaria.

The division spearheaded the Seventh Army drive, securing Landsberg, on 27 April and clearing the area between the Ammer and Würm Lakes by 30 April. The 12th Armored Division is recognized as a liberating unit of the Landsberg concentration camps near the Landsberg Prison, sub-camps of Dachau concentration camp on 27 April 1945. On 29 April 1945, the 12th AD liberated Oflag VII-A Murnau, a German Army POW camp for Polish Army officers interned north of the Bavarian town of Murnau am Staffelsee during World War II. 

Elements crossed the Inn River and the Austrian border at Kufstein on 3 May. The 12th Armored Division was relieved by the 36th Infantry Division on 4 May. On 5 May, Lieutenant (later Captain) John C. Lee Jr., Co. B, 23rd Tank Battalion, organized the rescue of VIP French prisoners from an Alpine castle in Tyrol during the Battle for Castle Itter. Under Lee&#x27;s command were members of the German Wehrmacht, who combined forces with 2 tanks from the 12th to fight the SS Commander and soldiers guarding the prisoners. For leading the successful rescue of these prisoners, Lee was promoted to captain and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

The 12th Armored Division engaged in security duty around Ulm until 22 November 1945, when it left Marseille, France, for home. Some members of the 12th attended the US Army University, in either Biarritz, France or Shrivenham, England during this time.

It was deactivated on 3 December 1945, and on 17 December 1945, its battle flags were turned in at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.

====POWs captured====

During its deployment the 12th Armored Division captured 72,243 enemy prisoners of war. Among them were Adolf Eichmann and Wernher von Braun.

Nearly 8,500 Allied POWs, including 1,500 Americans, and an additional 20,000 non-military prisoners, were liberated by the 12th AD.

===The &quot;Hellcat News&quot; (newspaper)===
The &quot;Hellcat News&quot;, the newspaper of the 12th Armored Division, was first published in 1942 as an information sheet. Initial publication was part of the public relations duties of the Special Services unit of the 12th Armored Division while the division trained at Camp (later Fort) Campbell, Kentucky. In 1943, after the division was transferred to Camp Barkeley in Abilene, Texas, the division commander, Major General Carlos Brewer, assigned three men to Special Services to continue the newspaper.
The first official issue of the newspaper was published at Camp Campbell, Kentucky, although the byline reads &quot;Somewhere in Tennessee&quot;. This was because Camp Campbell was in the Tennessee Maneuver Area located on the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and Clarksville, Tennessee. Due to its close proximity to Clarksville, Tennessee, the War Department on 6 March 1942, designated Tennessee as the official address of the new camp. This caused a great deal of confusion, since the Headquarters was in Tennessee and the post office was in Kentucky. After many months of mail delivery problems, Colonel Guy W. Chipman requested that the address be changed to Camp Campbell, Kentucky. The U.S. War Department officially changed the address on 23 September 1942.

The newspaper continued to be published by the division Special Services after transfer of the division to Camp Barkeley in Abilene, Texas, from February 1944 through the final issue published in the U.S during the war on 10 August 1944 (Vol. 2, No. 26), when the entire division was shipped to Europe to join the 7th Army in France. Publication resumed with Volume 3, Issue 1 on 18 May 1945, in Heidenheim, Germany, following cessation of combat operations in the ETO. The Special Services of the division published the first issues in Europe on a weekly basis when conditions permitted, until the deactivation of the division in 1946.
The &quot;Hellcat News&quot; is one of two U.S. military newspapers that has been continuously published since World War 2, the other being the older &quot;Stars and &quot;Stripes&quot;, which began publication on 9 November 1861 in Bloomfield, Missouri. The &quot;Hellcat News&quot; is the oldest U.S. Armed Forces divisional newspaper still being published since World War 2.

====Content====
Wartime publications contained division news stories, cartoons and photographs. The later editions of the 12th Armored Association contain information about former members of the division, organizational news including information about the yearly reunion, original cartoons, and photographs both from the war years and afterwards. A series relating the history of the division is also recounted in the newspaper. In addition, the president of the association and the secretary included messages of interest in most issues. These messages contain information about the division&#x27;s Medal of Honor recipient, Staff Sergeant Edward A. Carter Jr.
The Hellcat News is published by the 12th Armored Division Association. Archived copies of the Hellcat News from the first issue in 1943 through 2012 are available online through the West Texas Digital Archive.

==12th Armored Division Memorial Museum==

In October 2001 the 12th Armored Division Memorial Museum opened its doors to the public in Abilene, Texas, with the stated mission to serve as a display and teaching museum for the study of World War II and its impact on the American people.
&quot;The Twelfth Armored Division Memorial Museum is located in Abilene, Texas, near (northeast of) the site of the former Camp Barkeley where the Division trained prior to being sent overseas into the European Theater of Operations. The Museum holds collections of the 12th Armored Division, World War II archives, memorabilia, and oral histories, along with selected equipment and material loaned or donated by others. The education plan focuses on expanding academic access to World War II historical materials, veterans, and their families; preserving the history of the 12th Armored Division for study, research, and investigations by future generations; providing training in public history professions, developing new education programs for students and establishing a technology bridge between the 12th Armored Division Historical Collection and the public.&quot;

As part of an ongoing venture to become a larger part of the West Texas community and the greater Abilene area, 12th Armored Division Memorial Museum has partnered with the West Texas Digital Archives, providing access to copies of the &quot;Hellcat News&quot; from first edition to 2012.

<text>The 13th Armored Division was an armored division of the United States Army in World War II.

==History and combat chronicle==
The division was activated on 15 October 1942 at Camp Beale, east of Marysville, California.

The 13th Armored, known as the Black Cats, landed at Le Havre, France, 29 January 1945. After performing occupation duties, the Division moved to Homberg near Kassel to prepare for combat under the Third Army, 5 April. At Altenkirchen, it was attached to the XVIII Airborne Corps and prepared for the Ruhr Pocket operation. The attack jumped off at Honnef, 10 April. After crossing the river Sieg at Siegburg, the 13th pushed north to Bergisch Gladbach, then toward Duisburg and Mettmann by 18 April.

Shifting south to Eschenau, the Division prepared for Bavarian operations. Starting from Parsberg, 26 April, the 13th crossed the Regen river, then the Danube at Matting and secured the area near Dünzling. On the 28th, elements closed in at Plattling and crossed the Isar River. Moderate to heavy resistance was met during this drive through southern Germany. The Division smashed into Braunau am Inn, Austria, 2 May, and the command post was set up in the house where Hitler was born. A bridgehead across the Inn was established at Marktl, but the river was not crossed as orders came to reassemble north of Inn River, 2 May.

Preparations were made for further advances when the war in Europe ended. The 13th remained in Germany until 25 June and left Le Havre, France, for home, 14 July 1945.

The division moved to Camp Cook, California after returning to the United States. It was training in amphibious operations at the time of the Japanese surrender. The men were aware that it was an open secret that they were likely to participate in the invasion of Japan. It was inactivated on 15 November 1945.

The division was reactivated in 1947, reflagged from the 19th Armored Division, which had been &quot;placed on rolls&quot;, but not actually activated, during World War II. The 19th Armored Division was eventually activated just after the war, and allotted to the Sixth Army area of the Organized Reserves (specifically California, Oregon, and Arizona). In 1947, the 19th Armored Division was reflagged as the 13th Armored Division at California&#x27;s request. In 1952, the division was reflagged as the 63rd Infantry Division in Los Angeles, California, and thus the 13th Armored Division was finally inactivated.

<text>The 14th Armored Division was an armored division of the United States Army assigned to the Seventh Army of the Sixth Army Group during World War II. It remains on the permanent roll of the Regular Army as an inactive division, and is eligible for reactivation. The division is officially nicknamed the &quot;Liberators&quot;.

==History==
The 14th Armored Division was constituted and added to the roll of the US Army on 28 August 1942; it was activated on 15 November in a ceremony at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas. It was organized initially as a heavy division with two armored regiments (the 47th and 48th) and one armored infantry regiment, the 62nd Infantry Regiment. It was reorganized from a heavy division to a light division on 20 September 1943. The reorganization saw the loss of two tank battalions from the Armored regiments, one battalion each. The 1st Battalion of the 47th Armor was redesignated as the 786th Tank Battalion and the 3rd Battalion of the 48th Armor was redesignated as the 716th Tank Battalion.

The division departed Camp Chaffee in November to participate in the 2nd Army maneuvers in Tennessee from 17 November 1943 until 10 January 1944. At the conclusion of the exercise, the division was assigned to Camp Campbell, Kentucky. The division remained at Camp Campbell until late September when it was alerted for movement to the ETO (European Theater of Operations) via Camp Shanks, New York where it went for final processing. Units departed Camp Campbell on 1 October and completed their arrival at Camp Shanks on the 6th of that month. After completing their processing, the division boarded four transport ships for deployment on 13 October 1944.

===France and the Alsatian Plain===
The 14th Armored Division landed at Marseille in southern France, on 29 October 1944. Within two weeks some of its elements were in combat, maintaining defensive positions along the Franco-Italian frontier. The division was assigned to US 6th Army Group on 1 November. On 10 November, the division was assigned to US Seventh Army. On 12 November the Combat Command Reserve (CCR) was detached, and ordered to the Maritime Alps by 6th Army Group to relieve units in defensive positions there. On 15 November, Combat Command A moved north from the area of Marseille to Epinal to take part in the VI Corps drive through the Vosges Mountains, and was followed by Combat Command B five days later. Hard fighting at Gertwiller, Benfeld, and Barr helped VI Corps to crack the German defenses, the division was on the Alsatian Plain in early December. On 17 December the division attacked across the Lauter River into Germany itself, along with the other units of VI Corps, it fought its way into a heavily defended portion of the German Westwall. Due to the growing crisis in the Ardennes, General Eisenhower, the supreme commander, ordered the Seventh Army to stop its attack and withdraw from the Westwall, where its units assumed positions south of the Lauter River. The order was poorly timed as elements of the 14th Armored Division had penetrated deep into the German defenses, and were poised to break out into the enemy&#x27;s rear.

===Operation Nordwind===
====Task Force Hudelson====
On 25 December 1944 VI Corps ordered the division&#x27;s Combat Command R, commanded by Colonel Daniel Hudelson, to assemble a regimental-sized task force (TF Hudelson), to establish defensive positions along a 10-mile section of the Seventh Army line linking XV and VI Corps. It was located in the rugged Vosges Mountains in the area of Bannstein in France, southeast of Saarbrücken. The balance of the division was placed in Corps Reserve to protect against a Saar Valley penetration by the Germans. Additionally, it was ordered to be prepared to move to the vicinity of Phalsbourg as a counter-attacking force to stop and prevent a break-through in the XV Corps area.

TF Hudelson consisted of the division&#x27;s 62nd Armored Infantry Battalion, the 94th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and Company A of the 125th Armored Engineer Battalion. TF Hudelson was further reinforced by two VI Corps units, the 117th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and the 1st Battalion, 540th Combat Engineers. Just before midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1944, the German Army Group G launched Operation Nordwind, the last major German counter-offensive of the war. The advancing German units were from the XC and LXXXIX Corps, attacking through the Low Vosges. TF Hudleson held only a thin line of strong points and screens. During the night and day of 1 January 1945, TF Hudelson found itself engaged by elements of five enemy divisions, the 256th, 257th, 361st and 559th Volksgrenadier. Just after midnight on the 1st, the 62nd Armored Infantry reported &quot;enemy attack across the entire front of our battalion zone. The main effort by enemy being made on battalion left flank in the sector of C Co, by estimated 2000 Infantry supported by five (5) Mark IV tanks&quot;. The troops of TF Hudelson took the brunt of the German advance which had penetrated to Bannstein by day-break. The Task Force was soon overrun or bypassed by the German divisions but it managed to delay and slow the German advance until substantial reinforcements could arrive and stem the German advance. By the fourth day of the German counter-offensive it had advanced 10 miles. With pressure building during the first day of the attack, aerial observation reported a strong regimental size element moving towards Bannstein. Reinforcements were sent to Baerenthal to reinforce the VI Corps left flank and the 14th Armored Division was ordered to establish blocking positions. On 2 January, the 45th Division along with the attached Task Force, occupied positions to block any further penetration by the Germans. This allowed for the relief of Task Force Hudelson and its return to division control.

The major fighting between 1 and 8 January occurred in the Vosges Mountains and two combat commands of the division were in almost continuous action against the German thrusts. With the failure of his attack in the Vosges, the enemy attempted to break through to Hagenau and threaten Strasbourg and the Saverne Gap by attacks at Hatten and Rittershoffen, two small villages located side by side on the Alsatian Plain. However, this, the strongest attack of Operation Nordwind, was halted by the 14th Armored in the fierce defensive Battle of Hatten-Rittershoffen which ranged from 9 to 21 January 1945.

====Hatten and Rittershoffen====
As the fighting in the VI Corps sector intensified, the Germans committed the 21st Panzer and the 25th Panzer Grenadier Divisions to the attack with a breakthrough to Hagenau. On 9 January, German armor was able to penetrate the center of the VI Corps sector. This caused Brooks, the Corps commander, to commit his final reserve force, the 14th Armored, in an effort to stop the German XXXIX Panzer Corps advance. Ordered to take up positions in the vicinity of Hatten and Rittershoffen, the 14th assumed command and control of units from the 242nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 315th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division . With heavy fighting in and around the towns, success was measured in how many buildings were controlled by each side as the Americans controlled the western half of the villages and the Germans the eastern half. On 15 January, the Germans strengthened the forces in both villages with elements of the 20th Parachute Regiment from the 7th Parachute Division, and the 104th Infantry Regiment from the 47th Volksgrenadier Division. As the fighting raged, the 14th Armored found itself increasingly on the defensive with Combat Command A holding Rittershoffen and Combat Command Reserve defending positions in and around Hatten. Combat Command B took up defensive positions behind the Rittershoffen to Leiterswiller road.

The resupply of the division was becoming very difficult due to the constant reorganizing of forces, the evacuation of the wounded and the shrinking perimeter. Gasoline, of which almost 200,000 gallons was consumed in seven days, had to come from near Saverne 35 miles away along icy roads in blackout conditions. Mortar ammunition had run out by 15 January and the Division&#x27;s G-4 notified the advanced command post that no more might be available for two weeks. Instructions were given for all abandoned German 8 cm mortar ammunition to be picked up and a method was devised by the Division ammunition officer to use this in American 81mm mortars. Artillery ammunition was strictly rationed after 15 January when 6,247 rounds of ammunition were expended out of a total of nearly 40,000 rounds for the entire seven days. In order to alleviate the shortage a convoy of twenty 2 1/2 ton trucks were sent to Marseilles and returned loaded with ammunition dug out of the surf and the landing sites for the invasion of Southern France. Artillery was further handicapped by the shortage of telephone wire. Poor visibility hampered air operations on both sides for most days. On 15 January the first German jet propelled aircraft was seen in the area bombing a battery of the 499th Armored Field Artillery Battalion.

Approximately 39 American and 51 German tanks were destroyed, damaged or abandoned. Recovery of disabled vehicles was very difficult due to the complete lack of cover. Following the battle, the division&#x27;s G-4 (staff officer) reported to the commanding officer that the division was still short of 62 medium tanks despite having received over 60 replacements during the month of January. The 136th Ordnance Maintenance Battalion&#x27;s report for the month listed approximately 150 tanks that had been knocked out in combat, repaired and returned to the division&#x27;s tank battalions. An example of this is seen in the operational reports of the 47th and 48th Tank Battalions. At the height of the fighting the 47th reported that it had a total of 17 operational tanks out of an authorized strength of 50, all were committed to holding its portion of the line. The 48th Tank Battalion report for the same period included the comment that its tank companies were now of approximately squad strength.

The Division sustained battle casualties amounting to 104 killed, 899 wounded and 112 missing. German losses were estimated at in excess of 3,100 in total. The problem of obtaining infantry and armored replacement personnel, especially combat junior officers, was critical.

The Division&#x27;s 11-day stand at Hatten and Rittershoffen allowed the VI Corps and Seventh Army to withdraw to prepared defensive positions. On 21 January, after the rest of Seventh Army had withdrawn to the south bank of the Moder River, the 14th and its supporting units withdrew from Hatten and Rittershoffen and moved south to join the rest of the army.

Lieutenant-General Jacob L. Devers, commanding general, 6th Army Group later commented that the Battle of Hatten-Rittershoffen &quot;was one of the greatest defensive battles of the war.&quot; The 14th Armored Division was nominated for four Presidential Unit Citations for its actions at Hatten-Rittershofen. Of these, two were awarded. Col. Hans von Luck, who commanded the 21st Panzer Division at Hatten-Rittershoffen wrote in his memoirs &quot;Panzer Commander&quot; that the battle &quot;... was one of the hardest and most costly battles that had ever raged on the western front.&quot; These are strong, telling words from a professional German panzer officer who had fought with Rommel&#x27;s famed Afrika Korps in North Africa, served two tours of duty on the Eastern Front, and led the only armored counter-attack to be attempted against the Allied beachhead in Normandy. A veteran officer who served on the staff of Army Group G during the battle wrote after the war that the American defense of the town against overwhelming odds was &quot;heroic.&quot;

After rest, rehabilitation and defensive missions during February and early March, the division returned to the offensive on 15 March 1945; it drove across the Moder River, cracked through the Siegfried Line and by the end of the month, had captured Germersheim on the Rhine River. On Easter Sunday, 1 April, the 14th moved across the Rhine near Worms, protecting the long left flank of the Seventh Army and advanced against moderate to heavy opposition through Lohr, Gemunden, Neustadt, and Hammelburg where, on 6 April, Combat Command B (CCB) liberated Stalag XIII-C and the more famous Oflag XIII-B.

===Capture of Oflag XIIIB and Stalag XIIIC===
After erecting a pontoon bridge near Worms across the Rhine on 1 April, the 14th attacked to the northeast with CCB in the lead. The initial task of CCB was to break through the Spessart Forest and into the rear of the German forces. The command advanced 75 miles on the first day with the lead elements reaching the town of Lohr. Approaching the town, the leading elements came under heavy small arms fire. As the infantry dismounted to clear the resistance, they and the tanks of the 47th Tank battalion experienced heavy antitank fire. The 47th lost three tanks due to the Panzerfaust.

Clearing the town, CCB continued its advance along the Main River through Sackenbach, Nantenbach (north east of Lohr) and Gemunden. As the columns continued along this route, they continued to receive heavy machine gun and mortar fire. On 6 April 1945, CCB&#x27;s objective was the military layer south of Hammelburg and the POW camps to the south. The operational plan called for the 47th Tank battalion to advance from the north and the 19th Armored Infantry battalion to block and secure the roads to the south and east of the camps. As the units approached the camps, they came under sporadic fire from German machine guns. Entering the German lager, the infantrymen of the 19th found the prison gates and forced an opening into Oflag XIII-B where they found a large contingent of Serbian and American officer prisoners.

Elements of the 47th Tank battalion and the 94th Armored Reconnaissance battalion continued to the south and liberated Stalag XIII-C which held a large contingent of Allied enlisted men - American, Australians, British and others.

===Capture of Stalag VII-A===
Following the Battle of Nuremberg, the division raced to the Danube, crossing the river at Ingolstadt and passed through the 86th Infantry Division. Its mission was to secure crossings sites on the Isar River and to push on to Moosburg and Landshut. Advancing on a south easterly axis, CCA was on the division&#x27;s right with CCR on the left and CCB in reserve. Facing the division were remnants of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier and the 719th Infantry Divisions. After fighting their way across the Isar and into Moosburg, CCA entered the town on 29 April, approached Stalag VII-A and took the surrender of the camp garrison of over 200 men. Initial reports had listed the number of prisoners liberated as 27,000. This was wrong, there were over 130,000 Allied prisoners liberated from Stalag VII-A, the largest prisoner of war camp in Germany. The division rapidly moved eastward to the area of Mühldorf am Inn where it established two strong bridgeheads across the Inn River before being ordered to halt by III Corps. The division fired its last rounds on 2 May 1945. It was processing prisoners of war and patrolling its area when the war in Europe ended on 8 May.

===Liberation of forced labor and concentration camps===
During the divisions&#x27; advance into southern Germany, on 2 and 3 May, the 14th liberated several sub-camps of the Dachau concentration camp. Upon entering the towns of Mühldorf and Ampfing, units of the division discovered three large forced labor camps containing thousands of Polish and Soviet civilians. Units also liberated two additional camps nearby holding Jewish prisoners.

===CCR Rifle Company===
As a result of the shortage of infantry replacements which the European Theater was facing in late 1944, a call for volunteers was distributed throughout the communication zone for those willing to retrain as infantry replacements. This call was accepted by over 4,000 African American soldiers serving in support units. By 1 February 1945, 2,800 of these volunteers received orders to report to a retraining center where they received basic instruction in infantry skills and tactics. In March 1945, the first contingent of soldiers, organized into 12 platoons, were assigned to the 7th Army which organized them into three companies of four platoons each. They were organized as 7th Army Provisional Rifle Companies 1, 2 and 3 and then assigned to the 12th Armored Division. In late March, the last contingent of four additional platoons were assigned to 7th Army which organized them as the 7th Army Provisional Rifle Company 4 and then assigned them to the 14th Armored Division.

This 240-man company was assigned to the division without a command and control element, the division was also required to staff, arm and equip it. The division, with the assistance of Corps and Army support, was able to provide the company with its basic needs for future operations. Initially, the company was attached to the 19th Armored Infantry Battalion but it was then reassigned to CCR where it became known as the CCR Rifle Company. This outfit was mainly employed as an attachment to the 25th Tank Battalion. The company&#x27;s first combat engagement took place near Lichtenfels, but it was near Bayreuth that the company received the accolade of approval from those that fought within the 14th Armored Division. In small platoon-size actions, CCR Rifle fought their way into Gottsfeld and Creussen helping to secure the towns. The company, when employed in less than company size, performed well. When employed as a company, the results were less satisfactory. This was a result of the way in which the companies were formed and trained, as platoons and not as a company. The unit remained with the division when it was reassigned to 3rd Army and ended the war with the 14th Armored. It was disbanded on 4 June 1945.

&quot;Liberators&quot; is the official nickname of the US 14th Armored Division. The division became known by its nickname during the last days of World War II when it liberated some 200,000 Allied prisoners of war from German prison camps. Among those liberated were approximately 20,000 American soldiers, sailors and airmen, as well as an estimated 40,000 troops from Great Britain and the Commonwealth.

The 14th Armored Division was inactivated on 16 September 1945 at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia.

==Organization ==
The division was organized and activated as a heavy division in 1942. Early in 1943, the Army Ground Force began a series of studies to reorganize the various divisions within the Army. After reviewing the tables of organization and after allowing the various commands to review and comment on the proposed restructure, the divisional strength of the 14 organized armored divisions was reduced from 14,630 men to 10,937. The restructuring removed the armored regiment and infantry regiment from the table of organization and replaced them with three tank battalions and three armored infantry battalions. Both Combat Commands, A and B remained but an additional Command - CCR, was added to the organization. This was a small headquarters element of 10 personnel tasked with the command and control of the division rear area. The 125th Engineer Battalion lost its bridge company, and the engineer line companies were reduced to three. The 94th Cavalry Recon Squadron was increased in size to include an HQ troop, four line troops, an assault gun troop (with four platoons) and a light tank company. Within the division trains, the division lost its support battalion and supply company.

<text>The Tata Steel Chess Tournament is an annual chess tournament held in January in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands. It was called the Hoogovens Tournament from its creation in 1938 until the sponsor Koninklijke Hoogovens merged with British Steel to form the Corus Group in 1999, after which the tournament was called the Corus Chess Tournament. Corus Group was taken over by the Tata Group and became Tata Steel Europe in 2007, with the tournament changing its name in 2011 to its current name. It has also been referred to as &quot;Wijk aan Zee&quot; since the venue change from the town of Beverwijk to the town of Wijk aan Zee in 1968. Despite the name changes, the series is numbered sequentially from its Hoogovens beginnings; for example, the 2025 event was referred to as the 87th Tata Steel Chess Tournament.

Top grandmasters compete in the tournament, but regular club players are welcome to play as well in the lower groups. The Masters group pits fourteen of the world&#x27;s best against each other in a round-robin tournament, and has sometimes been described as the &quot;Wimbledon of Chess&quot;. Since 1938, there has been a long list of very strong winners; of the fifteen undisputed World Chess Champions since the first tournament in 1938, only five – Alexander Alekhine, Vasily Smyslov, Bobby Fischer, Ding Liren and Gukesh Dommaraju – have not won it. In 2001, nine of the top ten players in the world participated.

Magnus Carlsen holds the record for most wins at the tournament, with eight titles to his name. Anand is the only other player to have won the event five or more times, with five wins. R Praggnanandhaa is the defending champion after defeating Gukesh in the tiebreaks in 2025.

Until recently, players ending on the same score shared the title. The first tie-break was held in 2018, with Magnus Carlsen defeating Anish Giri to clinch the title. As of the 2025 edition, if two or more players lead with the same score at the end of the round-robin, they all take part in the tiebreaks to determine the sole winner. The time control of the tiebreaks is blitz, and then sudden death.
== Tournament history ==

===Hoogovens Beverwijk===
The early tournaments were very small, starting with groups of four in 1938, and entry restricted to Dutch players. The first four tournaments continued this way, until 1942, when it was expanded to six players, and in 1943 to eight players. No tournament was held in 1945 due to World War II. The first international tournament was held in 1946, with the field expanded to ten, and invitations to Alberic O&#x27;Kelly de Galway (Belgium) and Gösta Stoltz (Sweden) along with a Dutch contingent of eight.

The 1946 tournament was one of the first European international chess tournaments after World War II. Food shortages were still a problem in Europe, so the post-tournament banquet featured pea soup, &quot;inexpensive fare of the common people&quot;. In subsequent years pea soup has been served as the first course of the concluding banquet, a tradition continued when the tournament was moved from Beverwijk to Wijk aan Zee.

The tournament field was increased to twelve in 1953, and an international women&#x27;s tournament was also held. In 1954 the tournament field was returned to ten players, but the strength of the competitions increased. The field was greatly enlarged to 18 in 1963, and although it reduced to 16 in 1964, the event had become the strongest international chess tournament in the world.

As the tournament grew in stature, the tournament began to offer lower groups such as a B-group (sometimes called &quot;Challengers&quot; in contrast to group-A or &quot;Masters&quot;), and occasionally a C-group. There also began a tradition to operate a year on year policy of inviting the winner of the B-group to the A-group.

Winners of the top group:

===Hoogovens Wijk aan Zee===

The tournament was moved to the Dutch seaside town Wijk aan Zee in 1968. Starting from 1982, the tournament mostly settled to its present number of 14 players.

The winners of the top group were:

===Corus tournament===

From 2000, the formal name for the tournament was changed to the &quot;Corus Chess Tournament&quot;. The winners of the A-group were:

===Tata Steel tournament===
From 2011, the formal name changed to the &#x27;Tata Steel Chess Tournament&#x27;. The winners of the Masters section were:

==Multiple winners==
The following players have won the tournament more than once; years where they shared the title are bolded.

<text>The 16th Armored Division was an armored division of the United States Army in World War II. In its one and only combat operation, the 16th Armored Division liberated the city of Plzeň in western Czechoslovakia (today the Czech Republic), an operation that influenced the landscape of post-war Europe.

==History==
The division was activated on 15 July 1943 at Camp Chaffee in Arkansas. They performed all of their training at Camp Chaffee until they received their staging orders. They staged at Camp Shanks at Orangeburg, New York on 28 January 1945, until got their port call. They sailed from the New York Port of Embarkation on 5 February 1945.

The 16th Armored Division arrived in France in stages between 11 and 17 February 1945, and processed into the European Theater of Operations. They had been assigned to the Fifteenth United States Army on 29 January 1945, but were waiting for an assignment to a unit actually involved in fighting.

The division was assigned to Third United States Army on 17 April 1945, and entered Germany on 19 April 1945. It crossed the Rhine at Mainz, and relieved the 71st Infantry Division at Nürnberg on 28 April 1945. The 23rd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron participated in combat from the Isar River to Wasserburg with the 86th Infantry Division. While under the control of that organization, it crossed the Isar River at Granek on 30 April 1945, advanced to Indorf, seized several small villages, and was driving toward Wasserburg against slight resistance when ordered to return to Nürnberg. The division was given a security and training mission at Nürnberg, Germany, until 5 May. When the 23rd Cavalry Squadron arrived at Nürnberg on 4 May, it reverted to the control of the 16th Armored. The division assembled and proceeded to Waidhaus, Germany on 5 May.

===Combat chronicle===
During the final days of battle in Europe, the final stronghold of German armed forces was a pocket in Czechoslovakia. As Soviet Red Army and American forces moved to the area, there was debate between US and British leaders regarding attempts to deny the Soviets a post-war foothold in Czechoslovakia. It was decided that the American forces would help the Soviets subdue the estimated 141,000 German troops before exiting the area. The task was aided by the desire of German forces to avoid imprisonment by the Soviets, with numerous German divisions arranging surrender to US forces, if the Americans arrived first. This did not stop fanatical German SS Troops from continuing to fight both Czechoslovakian and, as they arrived, American forces.

The 16th Armored Division was assigned to V Corps on 6 May, and attacked through the lines of the 97th Infantry Division, with Combat Command B (CCB) making the main effort. They advanced along the Bor–Plzeň Road that same day, launching an attack on Plzeň, Czechoslovakia, designed to capture the Skoda Munitions Plant. Combat Command Reserve (CCR) advanced through Plzeň to assigned high ground east of the city. The division spent 7 and 8 May in mopping up activities and patrolling. General Patton ordered elements of the 16th AD to move towards Prague, where the German commander was waiting to surrender to US forces, but the troops were recalled to Plzeň per the agreement with the Soviet Union. Aside from the few hours on the road to Prague, the capture of Plzeň marked the deepest point of American penetration into Czechoslovakia.

The Division suffered the lightest casualty count of all US Armored Divisions in Europe, with only 12 wounded, and spent 3 days in combat.

Three months later, the 16th AD was still located in Czechoslovakia, in Stříbro (west of Plzeň), on VJ Day.

The division returned to the New York Port of Embarkation on 13 October 1945 and was inactivated at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey on 15 October 1945.

==History==

The 20th Armored Division departed Boston on 6 February and arrived at Le Havre, France, 19 February 1945. On arrival it was sent to Buchy for a month&#x27;s assembly, preparation, and additional training. It then moved through Belgium to Langendernbach, Germany, 10 April. After considering breaking up the new division to provide replacements for the veteran armored divisions under his 12th U.S. Army Group, General Omar N. Bradley, sent the unit to Marktbreit, where the Division was attached to the III Corps; 20 April. Three days later, it was detached and reassigned to the XV Corps, Seventh Army, at Würzburg, Germany.

The condition of the Division when it arrived overseas was affected by a recent change in its primary mission. Until October 1944, the 20th Armored Division&#x27;s mission was to train soldiers and qualify them for overseas shipment as combat replacements for armored units. To perform this mission, the Division included in its strength an unusually large number of intelligent and highly trained men, including students from several of the Army&#x27;s advanced college training programs.

==Combat chronicle==
The actual arrival of the 20th Armored Division into combat occurred 4–9 April 1945. The division&#x27;s armored field artillery battalions (the 412th, 413th, and 414th), with elements of the 33rd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, moved up to the west bank of the Rhine River to support the 101st Airborne Division near Delhoven, Germany, and the 82nd Airborne Division across the river from Hitdorf, Germany. It was the 412th that supported the 82nd in their attack on Hitdorf that resulted in the awarding of a Distinguished Unit Citation.

Overlooking the above, incomplete official records minimize the Division&#x27;s perceived combat activity, i.e., citing: Elements of the division first saw action as Task Force Campbell when a false surrender by the enemy resulted in fighting in the town of Dorf, 25 April.

At that time, the Division assembled near Deiningen and reconnoitered for routes to the Danube River.
The 20th Armored Division&#x27;s 27th Tank Battalion (a component of Combat Command R) was attached to the veteran 42nd Infantry Division on 23 April 1945 and led the attack to capture the town of Donauwörth on the 25th to secure the crossing of the Danube. The river was crossed on 28 April, the 20th meeting sporadic resistance. The success of the operation prompted Lt. Col. Donald E. Downard, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, 222nd Infantry (42nd Infantry Division) who had witnessed more than 25 months of combat, to state: &quot;I have never seen a more aggressive armored unit.&quot; Subsequently, elements of the 20th seized the bridge over the Paar River at Schrobenhausen, and secured crossings over the Ilm River.

Elements of the 20th Armored Division, along with those of the U.S. Seventh Army&#x27;s 45th (Thunderbird) and 42nd (Rainbow) Infantry Divisions, participated in the liberation of Dachau concentration camp on 29 April 1945. While anecdotal reports indicate varied 20th AD troops took part in the unfolding process of discovery and liberation of the camp, ultimately it was the above attachment of elements of the 27th Tank Battalion to those of the 42nd Infantry Division on which the 20th Armored would be jointly recognized by the US Army Center for Military History (CMH) and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) as an official Liberating unit. The Division and its flag were subsequently added to USHMM displays and were cited online there and elsewhere.

Meanwhile, in support of units of the 45th Infantry Division (primarily belonging to the 180th and 157th Infantry Regiments), elements of the 20th Armored Division&#x27;s Combat Command B (including certain forces of the 20th Tank Battalion, 65th Armored Infantry Battalion, and 413th Armored Field Artillery Battalion), operating together as Task Force 20, were awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for their collective action in the Central European (Southern Germany) Campaign. The Recommendation for Unit Citation, dated 3 October 1945, states:

&quot;These units, which constituted Task Force 20, are cited for outstanding performance of duty in action during the period 28–30 April 1945, in the vicinity of Neuherberg, Germany. With soldierly courage and irrepressible determination members of Task Force 20 pushed an armored spearhead 45 miles beyond the Danube River to the outskirts of Munich, destroying a supply train, capturing almost 800 prisoners, and securing four bridges over the Amper River intact. Continuing the attack on 29–30 April against an enemy entrenched in elaborately prepared dugouts and behind the thick walls of the SS Training Center and an Anti-tank School which were defended by small arms, machine guns, hundreds of panzerfausts and twelve 88 mm guns, our troops killed 700 SS Troops, who fought stubbornly and fanatically. This victory destroyed the defenses of Munich, Germany, removing resistance to the entry of troops into the City.&quot;

The 27th Tank Battalion remained attached to the 42nd Infantry Division during its attack on Munich, 29–30 April. Despite its recent efficacy in the combat zone, the rest of the 20th was ordered off the roads leading into Munich on 28 April, allowing the veteran 42nd (Rainbow) and 45th (Thunderbird) Infantry Divisions to capture Munich proper.

In pursuit of retreating German troops and prevention of a feared German National Redoubt in the Austrian Alps, elements of the 20th Armored (primarily of Combat Command A) crossed the Inn River at Wasserburg on 3 May, entered Traunstein on 4 May, and had entered Salzburg when it received word that hostilities would cease in Europe.

Following V-E Day, the Division performed Occupation duties, returning to the U.S. in August 1945, slated for participation in the then-planned invasion of Japan. The Division reported to Camp Cooke, CA, for amphibious assault training, but after the atomic bombs were dropped and Japan surrendered, the unit was inactivated on 2 April 1946 at Camp Hood in Texas.

Officially, the Division is erroneously credited with only eight days in combat (overlooking the previously described Rhine action)

&quot;Peanuts&quot; creator, Charles Schulz, rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant (and Light Machine Gun Squad Leader) while a member of the Division&#x27;s 8th Armored Infantry Battalion. While Schulz&#x27;s unit was nearby, it did not actually enter Dachau.
Richard Nixon&#x27;s future Vice President, Spiro Agnew, attained the rank of 1st Lieutenant while with the 20th Armored Division&#x27;s 480th Armored Infantry Regiment (prior to reorganization to light armored division TO&amp;E).

<text>Adalbert is a German given name which means &quot;noble bright&quot; or &quot;noble shining&quot;, derived from the words &quot;adal&quot; (meaning noble) and &quot;berht&quot; (shining or bright). Alternative spellings include Adelbart, Adelbert and Adalberto. Derivative names include Albert and Elbert.

Because St Adalbert of Prague (†997), early mediaeval missionary who became Czech, Polish and Hungarian patron saint, at his confirmation changed his name from native Vojtěch to Adalbert, this Germanic name has been artificially assigned to Slavonic Vojtěch/Wojciech (&quot;he who is happy in battle&quot;) and via the same process have been the names Vojtěch and Adalbert connected with Hungarian name Béla (maybe &quot;inner part&quot;) – so, in Central European settings these three names are taken as the equivalents, although they have no linguistic connection to each other.
