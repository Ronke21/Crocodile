<text>Earl of Crawford is one of the most ancient extant titles in Great Britain, having been created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1398 for Sir David Lindsay. It is the premier earldom recorded on the Union Roll.

==Early history==
Sir David Lindsay, who married Elizabeth Stewart, Countess of Crawford, a daughter of Robert II, was the 9th baron of Crawford, Lanarkshire. He was given the title of Earl of Crawford by Robert II in 1398, along with Crawford Castle.

The title descended to the first Earl&#x27;s descendants without much incident, until the death of David Lindsay, 8th Earl of Crawford, in 1542. The eighth Earl had a son, Alexander, commonly called the &quot;Wicked Master&quot;, who frequently quarrelled with his father and even tried to murder him. The Wicked Master was sentenced to death for his crime, and the eighth Earl conveyed his title to a cousin, also called David Lindsay, a descendant of the third Earl of Crawford, and excluded from the succession all of the Wicked Master&#x27;s descendants. However, the ninth earl, although he had his own sons, named the Wicked Master&#x27;s son David as his heir; thus, in 1558, at the ninth Earl&#x27;s death, the earldom returned to the main branch of the family. The ninth Earl is frequently referred to as an interpolated Earl, as are the 17th-22nd Earls.

==Later history==
At the death of Ludovic Lindsay, 16th Earl of Crawford, the title was passed, despite senior heirs, to a cousin, John, who had already been created Earl of Lindsay. The earldoms of Crawford and Lindsay continued to be united until the 22nd earl died unmarried in January 1808. The two earldoms then became dormant until the respective heirs could prove their claims to the titles.

In 1843, James Lindsay, 7th Earl of Balcarres put forward his claim to the Earldom of Crawford; in 1848, the House of Lords allowed it. The claim was based on the extensive research of his son Lord Lindsay. It was held that the seventh Earl&#x27;s father, the sixth Earl, was the lawful successor to the earldom of Crawford (though he did not claim it); therefore, the sixth Earl of Balcarres was posthumously declared the 23rd Earl of Crawford, and his son, the seventh Earl of Balcarres, became the 24th Earl of Crawford. Thereafter, these two earldoms have remained united (but the Earldom of Lindsay is separate).

The Earl of Crawford was mentioned in an episode of &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, when Hyacinth Bucket insisted that her milk be sourced from the &quot;very attractive herd&quot; on his estate.

Between 1963 and 2019, the 28th Earl and the 29th Earl acted as Premier Earl of Scotland.

==Subsidiary titles ==
The subsidiary titles associated with the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres are: &quot;Lord Lindsay of Crawford&quot; (created 1398), &quot;Lord Lindsay and Balniel&quot; (1651) and &quot;Baron Wigan of Haigh Hall&quot; (1826). The former two subsidiary titles, as well as the two Earldoms, are in the Peerage of Scotland. The barony is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and so entitled the Earls of Crawford and Balcarres to sit in the House of Lords even before the passage of the Peerage Act 1963 extended that right to peers of Scotland.

The 29th Earl sat in the House of Lords as &quot;Baron Balniel&quot;, of Pitcorthie in the County of Fife, a peerage under the Life Peerages Act 1958 conferred on him in 1974 after leaving the House of Commons in the aftermath of the October 1974 general election while his father was still living.

The Earl of Crawford is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Lindsay.

==Family seat==
The family seat is Balcarres House in Colinsburgh, Fife. Until the 1940s they were also seated at Haigh Hall, Lancashire. The traditional burial place of the Earls of Crawford is the family chapel at Balcarres House.

<doc id="440944" wikidata="Q5630880" url="?curid=440944" title="HMCS Pictou">
<text>HMCS &quot;Pictou&quot; was a Royal Canadian Navy which took part in convoy escort duties during the Second World War. She fought mainly in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Pictou, Nova Scotia.

==Background==

Flower-class corvettes like &quot;Pictou&quot; serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The &quot;corvette&quot; designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name &quot;flower&quot; was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants.

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.

==Construction==
&quot;Pictou&quot; was ordered on 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down by George T. Davie &amp; Sons Ltd. at Lauzon on 12 July 1940 and launched on 5 October 1940. She was commissioned into the RCN on 29 April 1941 at Quebec City, Quebec. During her career, &quot;Pictou&quot; had several periods in the dockyard. The first took place after being sent back three times during convoy duties with mechanical problems. The repairs began at Halifax Dockyard and were completed at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. The second period in refit was due to a collision. Repairs began in August 1942 and were completed in September. Her third major period of overhaul began in December 1942 after developing serious mechanical issues while on convoy escort. She needed emergency repairs at Halifax before heading to Liverpool to commence a serious refit. The final period of yard work of &quot;Pictou&quot;″s career took place from January to 31 March 1944 at New York during which her fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle was extended.

&quot;When the RCN took over from the British in Newfoundland in mid-1941, [Commodore Leonard W. Murray] saw escort ships streaming from the builders - and the shortage of skippers steadily worsening. For want of experienced captains, the four-month-old corvette &quot;Pictou&quot; lay idle in St John&#x27;s. Murray summoned Lieutenant A.G.S.Griffin, temporarily in charge. &quot;Just want to let you know I&#x27;m doing all I can to find another CO to get you to sea,&quot; said Murray. &quot;Sir -,&quot; Griffin swallowed hard. &quot;Let me have her.&quot; Murray reached a decision in seconds. &quot;All right, I&#x27;ll take a chance on you. She&#x27;s yours.&quot; And he made a corvette captain of a life insurance man ... Now, with only eight weeks&#x27; sea time, the &quot;old man&quot;, at 28, he took her to sea.&quot;

==Service history==
After completing workups, &quot;Pictou&quot; was assigned to the Newfoundland Escort Force. She was one of the first two corvettes to become trans-Atlantic Ocean escorts. She spent the rest of 1941 as an ocean convoy escort. She was sent back to port three times with mechanical difficulties which led to her being sent for major repairs. In June 1942 she joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) as part of escort group C-4.

On 5 August 1942, &quot;Pictou&quot; was rammed in fog by the Norwegian merchant SS &quot;Hindanger&quot; near St. John&#x27;s. She suffered severe damage to her stern and was sent back to port for repairs. After workups she joined MOEF escort group C-2. In December 1942 she developed severe mechanical problems again and departed for repairs and then refit, not returning to service until May 1943.

In May 1943 &quot;Pictou&quot; joined MOEF escort group C-3 and remained with them until departing for refit in January 1944. After workups in Bermuda she joined the Western Local Escort Force escort group W-5 in June 1944 and remained with them until the end of the war.

&quot;Pictou&quot; was paid off from the RCN on 12 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold for mercantile conversion and in 1950 reappeared as the whalecatcher &quot;Olympic Chaser&quot;. She was renamed in 1956 as &quot;Otori Maru No. 7&quot;. In 1963 she was converted to a barge.

<text>John Hanson (31 August 1922 – 4 December 1998) was a Canadian-born English tenor and actor, who starred in several West End musicals during the 1950s and 1960s.

Born John Stanley Watts in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, of English parents, who moved back across the Atlantic three years later. He was educated at Dumfries Academy in Dumfries, Scotland. His headmaster recognized his talent as a boy soprano, and recommended him to the BBC in Scotland. It was there that he made his debut, at the age of 12.

His 1960 album, &quot;The Student Prince / The Vagabond King&quot; peaked at Number 9 in the UK Albums Chart. Hanson was most famous for his role as the &quot;Red Shadow&quot;, the hero of the musical &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, which enjoyed a record-breaking revival at the Palace Theatre in 1967.

He also appeared in the 1973 Christmas Special of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot; Show in which he sang &quot;Stout-Hearted Men&quot;. He also appeared on BBC TV&#x27;s long running variety show, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;.

Hanson died in December 1998, at the age of 76, in Shepperton, Surrey, England.

<text>Clifton College is a public school in the city of Bristol in South West England, founded in 1862 and offering both boarding and day school for pupils aged 13–18. In its early years, unlike most contemporary public schools, it emphasised science rather than classics in the curriculum, and was less concerned with social elitism, for example by admitting day-boys on equal terms and providing a dedicated boarding house for Jewish boys, called Polack&#x27;s House. Having linked its General Studies classes with Badminton School, it admitted girls to every year group (from pre-prep up to Upper 6th, excepting 5th form due to potential O-levels disruption) in 1987, and was the first of the traditional boys&#x27; public schools to become fully coeducational. Polack&#x27;s House closed in 2005 but a scholarship fund open to Jewish candidates still exists. Clifton College is one of the original 26 English public schools as defined by the &quot;Public Schools Yearbook&quot; of 1889.

The school was also the headquarters of the US army in Britain during part of the Second World War. General Omar Bradley used the school&#x27;s buildings as a staff office from October to November 1944.

Clifton College is one of the few schools in the UK to have educated several Nobel laureates: Sir John Kendrew, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962; Sir John Hicks, winner of the 1972 Nobel Prize in Economics; Sir Nevill Francis Mott, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977; and Geoffrey Hinton who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024.

==Introduction==

The school takes boys and girls aged between 13 and 18. It has its own preparatory school, Clifton College Preparatory School (known as the &#x27;Pre&#x27;), for children from 8 to 13 which adjoins the school and shares many of the same facilities; there is also a pre-preparatory school for younger children aged 3 to 8 called Butcombe. To distinguish it from the junior schools, Clifton College proper is referred to as the &#x27;Upper School&#x27;.

There are around 720 children in the Upper School of whom about a third are girls. At the start of the 2004 – 2005 school year, a new boarding/day house for girls (Hallward&#x27;s House) was opened.

In 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot;, which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.

==World War II==

During World War II the heavy bombing of Bristol caused the students to be evacuated to Bude. In February 1941 the buildings were used by the Royal Army Service Corps as an Officer Cadet Training Unit. In 1942 they were replaced by the United States Army who established it as the headquarters of V Corps and then the First Army. Staff were involved in preparations for the Normandy landings under General Omar Bradley. After D-Day the college was taken over as headquarters of the Ninth Army under General William Hood Simpson.

To enable rapid travel and communications between the headquarters and dispersed units extensive use was made of light aircraft for travel. Some flights used Filton Airfield and others Whitchurch, however the majority were from the college&#x27;s playing fields at Beggars Bush Field, between the college and Leigh Woods, which was turned into an airfield.

==Houses==
Before 1987, Clifton was a boys-only school with seven boarding houses (School House, Brown&#x27;s, Watson&#x27;s, Dakyns&#x27;, Oakeley&#x27;s, Wiseman&#x27;s, Polack&#x27;s) and three day-houses (East Town, North Town and The South Town). In each of the current seven boarding Houses (four for boys, three for girls) live the Housemaster or Housemistress and family, an Assistant and the Matron. In addition, each House has up to four non-residential Tutors. Also, pupils wear ties with different coloured stripes according to their house membership; which are also the colours of the jerseys the pupils wear to distinguish between houses in inter-house sporting events.

There are 12 houses currently in the Upper School of Clifton College, which have an order of precedence based on the date of their foundation; it is traditional that day-pupil only houses are known as &quot;Towns&quot; and any house that admits boarders &quot;Houses&quot;. There are also houses in Clifton College Preparatory School that are not listed below.


Holland&#x27;s house, a girls&#x27; day house, was made in 2017 with colours white, pink and navy.

Several other houses have existed during the school&#x27;s history. In WW2, while the school was evacuated to Bude, United House (UH) was created from pupils of houses placed in temporary abeyance. Dakyns&#x27; House and Brown&#x27;s House were closed in 1993, and Polack&#x27;s House, which took Jewish boys only, was closed in 2005. These are listed below:

In the decades after the school&#x27;s foundation, with the exception of School House, the Houses were named after the Housemaster at the time, but in the late 19th century this pattern was abandoned, and all Houses reverted to the name of their first Housemaster. This nomenclature convention was not however used for Hallward&#x27;s House (founded in 2004 and named after a former Headmaster, Bertrand Hallward, nor for Worcester House (the second girls&#x27; house, founded in 1989 and named after the road in which it is situated). When Dakyns&#x27; House and Brown&#x27;s House were merged in September 1993, the original suggestion was to name the new establishment &quot;Dakyns-Brown&#x27;s House&quot;, but following a suggestion from a pupil, the name &quot;Moberly&#x27;s House&quot; was chosen, commemorating William Moberly, the only teacher who had been involved in both of the antecedent establishments (as Housemaster of both Dakyns&#x27; and House Tutor of Brown&#x27;s).

==Buildings and grounds==

===The first school buildings===


The college buildings were designed by the architect Charles Hansom (the brother of Joseph Hansom); his first design was for Big School and a proposed dining hall. Only the former was built and a small extra short wing was added in 1866 – this is what now contains the Marshal&#x27;s office and the new staircase into Big School. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building.

Hansom was called back in the 1870s and asked to design what is now the Percival Library and the open-cloister classrooms. This project was largely completed by 1875 – although the Wilson Tower was not built until 1890 (grade II listed).
Other buildings were added as follows:
* By 1875, Brown&#x27;s, Dakyns&#x27; and Oakley&#x27;s had been opened along with what is now 32 College Road – originally this functioned as accommodation for bachelor masters
* Three fives courts (1864)
* The original sanitorium (1865)
* Gymnasium (1867)
* Two swimming pools (1869)
* An open rackets court (1872)
* The present workshop (1873)
* The chapel (1867); this was built to Charles Hansom&#x27;s original design, but was moved from the intended site (which is now the gym). As built, the chapel was a narrow aisleless building, and just the width of its present west end. It was the gift of the widow of Canon Guthrie. Hansom was given permission &quot;to quarry sufficient stone from the college grounds for the purposes of the Chapel building&quot;.

The Chapel building was licensed by the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol in 1867. It is now grade II* listed.

===Later building===

The school&#x27;s present buildings have evolved in various phases.

In early Percival years, the nucleus of the school buildings was laid down.

In 1880, the school&#x27;s East Wing was completed as far as the staircase (this had yet to be linked to the library by the Wilson Tower) and added a science lecture-room (which is the reason for the curious &#x27;stepped&#x27; windows), a laboratory and several classrooms.
In 1886, a porters&#x27; lodge and what is now the staff common room were added by enlarging what had been the original science school. On the ground floor was the school tuck-shop and above this (in what is now the Upper Common Room) was a drawing-school. The day boys were provided for in Town Rooms for both North and South Town. The East Wing was then completed by carrying it beyond the staircase and then creating an additional classroom at each end. The ground-floor classroom (then Room 12) is now known as the &quot;Newbolt Room&quot; and has been furnished by the Old Cliftonian Society, which still uses it for reunions.
Between 1890 and the start of the First World War, the new Music School (1897) was added and the Chapel rebuilt (1910).

Dr John King, whose headmastership spanned the war years, had little scope for building after 1914, but he did oversee the development of the playing fields at Beggar&#x27;s Bush, the building of the Memorial Arch, the neo-classical cricket pavilion and the opening of the new Sanitorium in Worcester Road.
On 3 December 1918, the former headmaster John Percival died and was buried in the vault of the school Chapel. In 1921, a special memorial chapel was created and consecrated about his tomb.
Norman Whatley was the headmaster between 1923 and 1938; his tenure saw the opening of the Preparatory School and the building of the Science School on the site of the previous Junior School. Designed by A. E. Munby, it was opened in 1926.

Also at this time, the school acquired Hugh Ray Easton&#x27;s new east windows. The windows also contain a curiosity: beneath the representation of the heavenly Jerusalem is depicted a game of cricket on the Close – with one of Whatley&#x27;s sons taking part.
In 1965–1967, the theatre was built by the architects Whicheloe and MacFarlane.

In 1982, on the site of the old swimming pools, the new Sports Hall, remedial gym and a new covered swimming pool were built; previously boys used the outdoor Victorian pool and its outdoor covered changing cubicles.
The 1980s also saw the building of the Coulson Centre which links together two previously separate classroom blocks, at Muir and Birdwood houses. As a result of the improvements in modern medicine, the Sanitorium in Worcester Road was unnecessarily large for the school&#x27;s needs, and so the old pre-1921 Sanatorium on the Close has been refitted to serve this purpose, whilst the Worcester Road sanitorium has been refitted as the headmaster&#x27;s house.

More recently, in the latter 2000s, the Music School building in Guthrie Road was refurbished and extended.

===Memorial arch===

At the side of College Road, opposite what was Dakyns&#x27; boarding house (now East Town and North Town), is the college&#x27;s memorial arch designed by Charles Holden, which commemorates teachers and pupils who died in the two World Wars. Traditionally, the removal of headgear is expected when walking through the arch. There is also a school rule that states hands must be out of pockets when walking through the arch. It is now grade II listed. The college&#x27;s buildings, mainly School House, were used as the main HQ where the D-Day landings were planned. The college played a major part in both World Wars; Field Marshal Douglas Haig was an Old Cliftonian who went on to command the British armed forces in the First World War. Through the memorial arch and in front of School House is a life-size statue of Haig. At the edge of the quad is a memorial to those killed in the South African Wars.

===Sporting facilities===
The college sporting facilities include:
* Close Pavilion
* of local playing fields including the Close and College fields
* of playing fields at Clifton College Sports Ground (Beggar Bush Lane)
* Four Fives courts
* Gym
* Indoor heated swimming pool
* New pavilion
* On-campus cricket nets
* One 3G Football pitch
* One Olympic standard 4G hockey pitch
* Rackets court
* Real tennis court
* Seven on-campus tennis courts
* Twenty four tennis courts (including some under cover of the dome or &#x27;bubble&#x27;)
* Two Astroturf hockey pitches
* Two indoor gyms

===The Close===

The college ground, known as the Close, played a role in the history of cricket and witnessed 13 of W G Grace&#x27;s first-class hundreds for Gloucestershire in the County Championship. Grace&#x27;s children attended the college.

The Close featured in a well-known poem by O.C. Sir Henry Newbolt – Vitaї Lampada (&quot;There&#x27;s a breathless hush in the Close to-night&quot;)

==Cricket==
Clifton College was one of the original 8 &quot;Lord&#x27;s Schools&quot;, who were entitled to play fixtures at Lord&#x27;s against each other. These matches were Clifton v Tonbridge, Rugby v Marlborough, Cheltenham v
Haileybury, and Eton v Harrow. The Clifton v Tonbridge fixture at Lord&#x27;s was first played in 1914, but ceased to be played in the 1960s, along with most other Lord&#x27;s Schools matches. Today, only Eton v Harrow continues to take place at Lord&#x27;s. A centenary match took place in June 2014 to commemorate the anniversary of the first playing of this match.

On one of the college&#x27;s cricket pitches, now known as Collins&#x27; Piece, what was for 116 years the highest-ever cricket score was reached in June 1899, in the inter-house match between Clark&#x27;s House and North Town. In this match A. E. J. Collins, killed in the First World War, scored 628 not out, but not under the current rules of the game. The record was surpassed in January 2016 by 15-year-old Pranav Dhanawade of Mumbai, India, with a score of 1,009 in a schools&#x27; match. Collins was not the first Clifton schoolboy to hold this record: in 1868, Edward Tylecote, who went on to help England reclaim the Ashes in 1882–83, was a previous holder, with 404 not out in a game between Classicals and Moderns. Collins&#x27; achievement is commemorated on a small plaque on the side of the ceramics building.

A number of famous cricketers are Clifton alumni. A fuller entry can be found under the List of Old Cliftonians, and includes:
* W. G. Grace junior, son of W. G. Grace, Gloucestershire and MCC cricketer.
* Sir Kingsmill Key, Bt., captain of Surrey, MCC and England cricketer.
* John Daniell, captain of Somerset, England rugby international
* Basil Allen, cricketer, Gloucestershire captain
* Edwin Field, Middlesex cricketer, England rugby international
* James Kirtley, England cricketer
* Matt Windows, Gloucestershire cricketer and England &#x27;A&#x27; cap.
* Edward Tylecote, England cricketer
* George Whitehead, England cricketer
* Charlie Townsend, England cricketer
* Edward Scott, Gloucestershire &amp; MCC cricketer, England rugby international (captain).
* James Bush Gloucestershire cricketer, England rugby international
* Robert Edwin Bush Gloucestershire cricketer
* William Brain, English cricketer and footballer
* Archibald Fargus, English cricketer, scholar, clergyman
* Lothian Bonham-Carter, English cricketer, Justice of the Peace and soldier

==The Marshal==
The college employs a master called &quot;The Marshal&quot;, whose sole job is to enforce discipline, attendance at classes and other school rules (such as dress code, drinking, smoking and hair length) along with the general maintenance of safety of the pupils at the college. Many public houses near the school had photos of the Marshal, who was permanently banned so as not to discourage the attendance of pupils who were regular patrons. The current Marshal is Christopher Hughes who took his position in the term starting September 2010. The previous Marshal was Major Paul Simcox MBE. By tradition, a Marshal&#x27;s name is not added to the plaque listing the names of the school&#x27;s Marshals until after his death.

==Religious community==
Clifton has chapel services and a focus on Christianity, but for 125 years there was also a Jewish boarding house (Polack&#x27;s), complete with kosher dining facilities and synagogue for boys in the Upper School. This was the last of its kind in Europe. However, at the end of the 2004–05 school year, the Polack&#x27;s trust (Polack&#x27;s House Educational Trust) announced that Polack&#x27;s House would be closed due to the low numbers of boys in the house (although many pupils were turned down subsequently). Polack&#x27;s House Educational Trust (PHET) now offers scholarships to the school.

The school chapel was the inspiration behind Newbolt&#x27;s poem Clifton Chapel, which starts:

CLIFTON CHAPEL

:This is the Chapel: here, my son,
:Your father thought the thoughts of youth,
:And heard the words that one by one
:The touch of Life has turn&#x27;d to truth.
:Here in a day that is not far,
:You too may speak with noble ghosts
:Of manhood and the vows of war
:You made before the Lord of Hosts.

==Redgrave Theatre==
Clifton College has its own theatre, originally known as the Clifton College Theatre, but later renamed in honour of old-boy actor Michael Redgrave. The theatre was built in the 1960s and has a seating capacity of 323. As well as school productions, the venue hosts visiting small scale productions including many by the nearby Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.

==Covert filming==
Jonathan Thomson-Glover, a housemaster and former pupil, pleaded guilty to making covert films of children aged twelve to seventeen showering, changing, going to the toilet and conducting private acts, in the college itself and at an address in Cornwall. He was jailed in 2015, convicted at Taunton Crown Court, and sentenced to three years and nine months&#x27; imprisonment after admitting to 36 counts of taking, making and possessing indecent images of children.

Clifton College subsequently commissioned an independent expert to undertake a thorough review of safeguarding at the school, culminating in a report which it published in full. The report contained a number of recommendations, all of which were then implemented. This, together with a complete change in the school&#x27;s leadership in 2016, led to a wholesale transformation in safeguarding culture and practices at the school.

==The Old Cliftonian Society and the Clifton College Register==

The Old Cliftonian Society [OCS] is the Society for the alumni of Clifton College – whether pupils or staff. The OCS organises reunions at the school and publishes a newsletter for alumni. Alumni are known as Old Cliftonians or OCs.

The Register&#x27;s motto:
:&quot;There be of them, that have left a name behind them, that their praises might be reported...&quot;

The Clifton College Register is the official set of records held for Clifton College in Bristol. The Register is kept and maintained by the Old Cliftonian Society.

These records have been maintained unbroken from the start of the school in 1862 and list every pupil, master and headmaster. Each person is allocated a school number – for masters and headmasters the number is prefixed with either an M or HM. The Register also maintains a record of the school roll in numbers, the Heads of School and summarises the major sporting records for each year.

The Register, published by the Old Cliftonian Society, is in four volumes:
* 1862 – 1947 (a)
* 1862 – 1962 (b)
* 1962 – 1978 (c)
* 1978 – 1994 (d)

<doc id="440958" wikidata="Q7245844" url="?curid=440958" title="Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War">
<text>During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), management and treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) were very different from the standards of modern warfare. Modern standards, as outlined in the Geneva Conventions of later centuries, assume that captives will be held and cared for by their captors. One primary difference in the 18th century was that care and supplies for captives were expected to be provided by their own combatants or private resources.

==American prisoners==

King George III of Great Britain had declared American forces traitors in 1775, which denied them prisoner-of-war status. However, British strategy in the early conflict included pursuit of a negotiated settlement, and so officials declined to try or hang them, the usual procedure for treason, to avoid unnecessarily risking any public sympathy the British might still enjoy. Great Britain&#x27;s neglect, in the absence of the expected supplies from Patriots, resulted in starvation and disease. Despite the lack of formal executions, neglect achieved the same results as hanging.

American prisoners of war tended to be accumulated at large sites, which the British were able to occupy for extended periods of time. New York City, Philadelphia in 1777, and Charleston, South Carolina, were all major cities used to detain American prisoners of war. Facilities there were limited. The occupying army could sometimes be larger than the total civilian population. The surgeon in charge of the New York hospitals housing American prisoners, Francis Mercier, was accused of killing them by poisoning and by assault, and he was ultimately executed for an unrelated murder. An estimated 20,000 Americans were held as prisoner during the war, with almost half dying in captivity.

The loyalist stronghold of St. Augustine, Florida, was also used by the British to detain patriot prisoners. Notable prisoners included Brigadier General Griffith Rutherford of the Salisbury District Brigade.

===Prison ships===
The British used obsolete, captured, or damaged ships as prisons. Conditions were appalling, and many more Americans died of neglect in imprisonment than were killed in battle. While the Continental Army named a commissary to supply them, the task was almost impossible. Elias Boudinot, as one of the commissaries, was competing with other agents seeking to gather supplies for Washington&#x27;s army at Valley Forge. Historian Edwin G. Burrows writes that &quot;by the end of 1776, disease and starvation had killed at least half of those taken on Long Island and perhaps two-thirds of those captured at Fort Washington – somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500 men in the space of two months.&quot;

During the war, at least 16 hulks, including the infamous HMS &quot;Jersey&quot;, were placed by British authorities in the waters of Wallabout Bay off the shores of Brooklyn, New York as a place of incarceration for many thousands of American soldiers and sailors from about 1776 to about 1783. The prisoners of war were harassed and abused by guards who, with little success, offered release to those who agreed to serve in the British Navy. Over 10,000 American prisoners of war died from neglect. Their corpses were often tossed overboard but sometimes were buried in shallow graves along the eroding shoreline.

Many of the remains became exposed or were washed up and recovered by local residents over the years and later interred nearby in the Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument at Fort Greene Park, once the scene of a portion of the Battle of Long Island. 
Survivors of the British prison ships include the poet Philip Freneau, Congressmen Robert Brown and George Mathews. The latter was involved in extensive advocacy efforts to improve the prison conditions on the ships.

The American Revolution was an expensive war, and lack of money and resources led to the horrible conditions of British prison ships. The climate of the South worsened the difficult conditions. The primary cause of death in prison ships was diseases, as opposed to starvation. The British lacked decent and plentiful medical supplies for their own soldiers and had even fewer reserved for prisoners. Most American POWs who survived incarceration were held until late 1779, when they were exchanged for British POWs. Prisoners who were extremely ill were often moved to hospital ships, but poor supplies precluded any difference between prison and hospital ships.

===Prison laborers and other prisoners of the British===
American prisoners were additionally housed in other parts of the British Empire. Over 100 prisoners were employed as forced laborers in coal mines in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia – they later chose to join the Royal Navy to secure their freedom. Other American prisoners were kept in England (Portsmouth, Plymouth, Liverpool, Deal, and Weymouth), Ireland, and Antigua. By late 1782, England and Ireland housed over 1,000 American prisoners, who, in 1783, were moved to France prior to their eventual release.

Continental Army prisoners of war from Cherry Valley were held by Loyalists at Fort Niagara near Niagara Falls, New York and at Fort Chambly near Montreal.

==British, Hessian, and Loyalist prisoners==

===American laws of war===
During the American Revolution, some officers from the Continental Army attempted to put the laws of war into practice regarding prisoners of war. The Americans believed that all captives should be taken prisoner. On September 14, 1775, Washington, commander of the Northern Expeditionary Force, at camp in Cambridge, Massachusetts, wrote to Colonel Benedict Arnold: &quot;Should any American soldier be so base and infamous as to injure any [prisoner]... I do most earnestly enjoin you to bring him to such severe and exemplary punishment as the enormity of the crime may require.&quot;

After winning the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26, 1776, Washington found himself left with hundreds of Hessian troops who had surrendered to the Americans. Washington ordered his troops to take the prisoners in and &quot;treat them with humanity,&quot; which they did. &quot;Let them have no reason to complain of our copying the brutal example of the British army in their treatment of our unfortunate brethren who have fallen into their hands,&quot; Washington said. The official stance in the capturing of enemy troops was one of mercy.

===Grievances===
Edward G. Burrows remarks that although British and Hessian captives did &quot;fare better on the whole than their American counterparts,&quot; there were nevertheless &quot;instances of outrageous cruelty&quot; against them, that &quot;certain state governments had particularly bad records of prisoner abuse&quot;, and that there were &quot;numerous... complaints over the years from enemy prisoners about bad food, squalor and physical abuse.&quot; The treatment of prisoners of war varied from state to state. Provisions among the prisoners also varied but generally ranged from mediocre to bad in the last years of the war.

===British and German prisoners===
The British and the Germans shared similar and differing experiences as POWs. The Continental Congress&#x27;s policies on the treatment of POWs remained the same for all enemy combatants, and so the prisoner system was generally the same for the two nationalities. However, the British troops were valued more than the German mercenaries and thus there are many more examples of British prisoner exchanges than German.

Americans grew to hate the British more than the better-behaved Germans. The British were more likely to cause disturbances, get into fights, and oppose the guards and the militia, having been more invested in the defeat of the Americans than the Germans were.

===Loyalists===
Loyalists were the most hated POWs. The Continental Congress took the stance that since prisoners of war were enemy combatants, not criminals, the treatment of POWs differed from criminals. However, depending on the state, Loyalists were often treated more like criminals than POWs. Debate waged throughout the colonies whether to treat Loyalists as enemy soldiers or treasonous citizens.

===Prison towns===
There were very few American prisons because the Thirteen Colonies and the Continental Congress were not in a position to create new ones to imprison British and German soldiers. Instead, Congress sent most British and Hessian prisoners to local American towns and ordered local officials to hold them under strict parole.

The Continental Congress had the sole authority to decide where the prisoners went, and the local towns had little forewarning and no say in the matter. Prison towns found themselves with the burden of providing for hundreds or thousands of prisoners at a time. In towns that could not afford to feed prisoners, the prisoners were put to work to feed themselves. British and German prisoners cultivated gardens; worked for farms and craftsmen; and found other forms of unskilled labor. Local communities attempted to make prison towns as profitable as possible and often helped prisoners find jobs or sent them to other towns and states for work.

The more useful the prisoners of war were, the less economically burdensome they were on the town. A town unable to erect barracks for the prisoners was forced to house them in community churches and even citizens&#x27; homes. The Continental Congress&#x27;s forcing of Americans to quarter prisoners was a major source of contention among the people.

Even when British and Hessian prisoners of war were not being held in individual houses, they were still in public view, which caused general fear, resentment, and anger. Prisoners were generally not confined to their quarters and could remain in public for the duration of the day. Security proved to be a problem for prison towns. With no official police force and the military&#x27;s preoccupation with war, local militias and volunteers generally guarded the prisoners of war. Protests in prison towns were common, and people who denied prisoners entry were punished for disobeying the Continental Congress in the form of fines, jail time, and even property expropriation.

The reception prisoners received varied by location. Overall, the prisoners staying in Boston were in relative peace, remarking that the general population of Boston was civil and tolerant of them. In Virginia and other southern states, wealthy planters and plantation owners were happy to have prisoners (in Albemarle County, for example), because they could count on an even greater abundance of free or cheap labor.

In contrast, the lower class in the South was generally much less tolerant of sharing residence with abundant prisoner populations. In Maryland, the state militia directly and aggressively challenged the Continental Army when it attempted to escort the prisoners of war into the state. The South had a collective fear of insurrection that emerged because of the slave population.

==Convention Army==
On October 17, 1777, nearly 6,000 British and Hessian soldiers of the Convention Army surrendered to the Americans. The Continental Congress was now in the position of holding a massive number of prisoners of war on American soil, an infrequent occurrence until then. It was already struggling to provide for the Continental Army. After Saratoga, it also had to provide for enemy combatants.


===Background===
After British, German, and Canadian troops were defeated, Lieutenant General John Burgoyne and Major General Horatio Gates were unable to agree about the fate of 5,900 prisoners. In the Convention of Saratoga, the terms stipulated that the troops would be returned to Europe, never to wage war with North America again. Congress saw that condition as an abysmal part of the treaty for one of its greatest victories in the American Revolution and delayed its ratification repeatedly. General Burgoyne grew frustrated with Congress and openly condemned its actions. Congress used Burgoyne&#x27;s words as evidence that he was planning to renounce the convention and suspended it until Great Britain recognized American independence. The Americans ended up holding the Convention Army for the duration of the war.

===Marches===
&quot;After spending the next year in camps near Cambridge and Rutland, Massachusetts, they were sent by Congress on an overland odyssey that, by the end of the war, took them down to Virginia, then up to Maryland, into Pennsylvania again, and finally back to Rutland. Almost every step of the way they contended with meagre rations, shortages of fuel, inadequate accommodations, and physical violence.&quot;

Over the course of the revolution, the Convention Army was marched across the colonies. First, it was marched to Massachusetts and remained there for a year, and in 1778, it was moved to Virginia, where it remained for two years. In 1780, it was moved north and gradually dispersed to different states, cities, and towns for the rest of the war. The marches themselves were brutal on the soldiers, but their lives generally improved once they got to their destinations. The main reasons for the marches across America were security and finance.

Once resources became scarce in Massachusetts, Congress ordered the army to be moved South. The war effort was very different in the North as contrasted with the South. In 1780, it had become difficult to provide British and German prisoners of war and their guards with food in the South, where their presence had become a security risk. The British had started their official campaigns in the South, which brought the risk of insurrections. The Convention Army was thus ordered to march back North and was dispersed.

==Freedom==
There were three ways for a prisoner of war to achieve freedom after being captured: desertion, exchange, or parole. Most of the time, a small militia-hired guard was tasked to supervise the imprisonment of captured British and German soldiers. The guard&#x27;s ability to watch over prisoners efficiently was constantly tested. The Convention Army initially took its POW status gracefully, but only because it was under the assumption that it would be sent home within a year. When it became clear that the Americans had no intention of allowing the British to return to Great Britain until the war ended, tensions between the soldiers and the guard escalated, and desertions rose rapidly in number. Propaganda was used by Americans and by captured high-ranking British officials to dissuade troops from deserting, but it largely failed. Many of the prisoners who escaped captivity took American women with them and reared families. A large number of Hessians remained in the US after the war was over because they had married American women. Between the time of the Siege of Yorktown (1781) and the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783), many of the Convention troops, by then mostly Germans, escaped and took up permanent residence in the United States. The American government did not have the means to prevent this.

The two other official forms of reaching freedom (parole and exchange) were common among high-ranking officers. Parole specifically dealt with individual prisoners of war, and so the process of being removed from imprisonment or house arrest and placed on parole was very simple and speedy. Most British and German prisoners of war thus sought parole, but the breaking of parole was common; many used it to make desertion easier. Some British and Hessian prisoners of war were paroled to American farmers. Their labor made up for shortages caused by the number of men serving in the Continental Army.

Exchange, however, was a very complex and slow process because it involved negotiation and diplomacy between a new and inexperienced nation and a state that absolutely refused to recognize American independence. A major hindrance to exchange was the reluctance of the British to concede non-rebel status to its adversaries. The British perception of the Americans as rebels prevented exchange. A degree of mutual acceptance between Congress and the states of the principle of exchange and procedure in its implementing must have been attained by the end of March 1777. Exchange was handled primarily by Congress, instead of state powers. While state and local government had considerable power over parole, the federal government had power of negotiating exchanges.

==Reaction and impact==
The capture of thousands of British prisoners of war in the hands of the Americans had the effect of further dissuading British officials from hanging colonial prisoners, despite the abandoned hopes for a settlement by this stage, as they feared reprisals on prisoners being held by the Americans. After the Convention Army was captured, the rate of prisoner exchanges increased dramatically as a result.

During the first years of the conflict, the Continental Congress tried to give prisoners of war the same amount of provisions as the soldiers guarding them. However, after the capture of the Convention Army, resources turned scarce and the federal government had to rely on state governments to provide for prisoners of war. From 1777 to 1778, Lieutenant General Henry Clinton was providing food for the Convention Army, but he eventually decided to end his assistance and to place the full economic burden of providing for the prisoners on the US government. In order to compensate for the lack of resources Congress could give to the British and German prisoners, they were moved from state to state. The marches were largely a result of diminishing provisions.

Aside from the official marching of the Convention Army, captured prisoners were paraded through cities after military victories as a form of celebration for the Americans and humiliation for their enemies. The intent of the parades was to boost morale among Americans. The Revolutionary War had devastating effects on communities, and to see clear examples of US progress and victory helped gain support for the war effort.

<text>The Mpemba effect is the observation that a liquid (typically water) that is initially hot can freeze faster than the same liquid which begins cold, under otherwise similar conditions. There is disagreement about its theoretical basis and the parameters required to produce the effect.

The Mpemba effect is named after Tanzanian Erasto Bartholomeo Mpemba, who described it in 1963 as a secondary school student. The initial discovery and observations of the effect originate in ancient times; Aristotle said that it was common knowledge.

== Definition ==
The phenomenon, when taken to mean &quot;hot water freezes faster than cold&quot;, is difficult to reproduce or confirm because it is ill-defined. Monwhea Jeng proposed a more precise wording: &quot;There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.&quot;

Even with Jeng&#x27;s definition, it is not clear whether &quot;freezing&quot; refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice, the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice, or when the water reaches . Jeng&#x27;s definition suggests simple ways in which the effect might be observed, such as if a warmer temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface, thereby increasing thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container. Alternatively, the Mpemba effect may not be evident in situations and under circumstances that at first seem to qualify.

== Observations ==

=== Historical context ===
Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists, including Aristotle: &quot;The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner. Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun.&quot; Aristotle&#x27;s explanation involved &quot;antiperistasis&quot;: &quot;...the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality.&quot;

Francis Bacon noted that &quot;slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold.&quot; René Descartes wrote in his &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, relating the phenomenon to his vortex theory: &quot;One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated.&quot;

Scottish scientist Joseph Black investigated a special case of the phenomenon by comparing previously boiled with unboiled water; he found that the previously boiled water froze more quickly. Evaporation was controlled for. He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing. Joseph Black then discussed Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit&#x27;s description of supercooling of water, arguing that the previously boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.

=== Mpemba&#x27;s observation ===
The effect is named after Tanzanian scientist Erasto Mpemba. He described it in 1963 in Form 3 of Magamba Secondary School, Tanganyika; when freezing a hot ice cream mixture in a cookery class, he noticed that it froze before a cold mixture. He later became a student at Mkwawa Secondary (formerly High) School in Iringa. The headmaster invited Dr. Denis Osborne from the University College in Dar es Salaam to give a lecture on physics. After the lecture, Mpemba asked him, &quot;If you take two similar containers with equal volumes of water, one at and the other at , and put them into a freezer, the one that started at freezes first. Why?&quot; Mpemba was at first ridiculed by both his classmates and his teacher. After initial consternation, however, Osborne experimented on the issue back at his workplace and confirmed Mpemba&#x27;s finding. They published the results together in 1969, while Mpemba was studying at the College of African Wildlife Management.

Mpemba and Osborne described placing samples of water in beakers in the icebox of a domestic refrigerator on a sheet of polystyrene foam. They showed the time for freezing to start was longest with an initial temperature of and that it was much less at around . They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation and the effect of dissolved air as significant factors. In their setup, most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface.

=== Modern experimental work ===
David Auerbach has described an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath. In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.

In 2016, Burridge and Linden defined the criterion as the time to reach , carried out experiments, and reviewed published work to date. They noted that the large difference originally claimed had not been replicated, and that studies showing a small effect could be influenced by variations in the positioning of thermometers: &quot;We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect.&quot;

In controlled experiments, the effect can entirely be explained by undercooling and the time of freezing was determined by what container was used. Experimental results confirming the Mpemba effect have been criticized for being flawed, not accounting for dissolved solids and gasses, and other confounding factors.

Philip Ball, a reviewer for &quot;Physics World&quot; wrote: &quot;Even if the Mpemba effect is real — if hot water can sometimes freeze more quickly than cold — it is not clear whether the explanation would be trivial or illuminating.&quot; Ball wrote that investigations of the phenomenon need to control a large number of initial parameters (including type and initial temperature of the water, dissolved gas and other impurities, and size, shape and material of the container, and temperature of the refrigerator) and need to settle on a particular method of establishing the time of freezing, all of which might affect the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect. The required vast multidimensional array of experiments might explain why the effect is not yet understood.

&quot;New Scientist&quot; recommends starting the experiment with containers at , respectively, to maximize the effect.

== Suggested explanations ==
While the actual occurrence of the Mpemba effect is disputed, several theoretical explanations could explain its occurrence.

In 2017, two research groups independently and simultaneously found a theoretical Mpemba effect and also predicted a new &quot;inverse&quot; Mpemba effect in which heating a cooled, far-from-equilibrium system takes less time than another system that is initially closer to equilibrium. Zhiyue Lu and Oren Raz yielded a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics, predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the Ising model and diffusion dynamics. Antonio Lasanta and co-authors also predicted the direct and inverse Mpemba effects for a granular gas in a far-from-equilibrium initial state. Lasanta&#x27;s paper also suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity distribution function that significantly deviates from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. 

James Brownridge, a physicist at Binghamton University, has said that supercooling is involved. Several molecular dynamics simulations have also supported that changes in hydrogen bonding during supercooling take a major role in the process. In 2017, Yunwen Tao and co-authors suggested that the vast diversity and peculiar occurrence of different hydrogen bonds could contribute to the effect. They argued that the number of strong hydrogen bonds increases as temperature is elevated, and that the existence of the small strongly bonded clusters facilitates in turn the nucleation of hexagonal ice when warm water is rapidly cooled down. The authors used vibrational spectroscopy and modelling with density functional theory-optimized water clusters.

The following explanations have also been proposed:
* Microbubble-induced heat transfer: The process of boiling induced microbubbles in water that remain stably suspended as the water cools, then act by convection to transfer heat more quickly as the water cools.
* Evaporation: The evaporation of the warmer water reduces the mass of the water to be frozen. Evaporation is endothermic, meaning that the water mass is cooled by vapor carrying away the heat, but this alone probably does not account for the entirety of the effect.
* Convection, accelerating heat transfers: Reduction of water density below tends to suppress the convection currents that cool the lower part of the liquid mass; the lower density of hot water would reduce this effect, perhaps sustaining the more rapid initial cooling. Higher convection in the warmer water may also spread ice crystals around faster.
* Frost: Frost has insulating effects. The lower temperature water will tend to freeze from the top, reducing further heat loss by radiation and air convection, while the warmer water will tend to freeze from the bottom and sides because of water convection. This is disputed as there are experiments that account for this factor.
* Solutes: Calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and other mineral salts dissolved in water can precipitate out when water is boiled, leading to an increase in the freezing point compared to non-boiled water that contains all the dissolved minerals.
* Thermal conductivity:
*# The container of hotter liquid may melt through a layer of frost that is acting as an insulator under the container (frost is an insulator, as mentioned above), allowing the container to come into direct contact with a much colder lower layer that the frost formed on (ice, refrigeration coils, etc.) The container now rests on a much colder surface (or one better at removing heat, such as refrigeration coils) than the originally colder water, and so cools far faster from this point on.
*# Conduction through the bottom is dominant, when the bottom of a hot beaker has been wetted by melted ice, and then sticky frozen to it. In context of Mpemba effect it is a mistake to think that bottom ice insulates, compared to poor air cooling properties.
* Dissolved gases: Cold water can contain more dissolved gases than hot water, which may somehow change the properties of the water with respect to convection currents, a proposition that has some experimental support but no theoretical explanation.
* Hydrogen bonding: In warm water, hydrogen bonding is weaker.
* Crystallization: Another explanation suggests that the relatively higher population of water hexamer states in warm water might be responsible for the faster crystallization.
* Distribution function: Strong deviations from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution result in potential Mpemba effect showing up in gases.

== Similar effects ==
Other phenomena in which large effects may be achieved faster than small effects are:
* Latent heat: Turning ice to water takes the same amount of energy as heating water from to .
* Leidenfrost effect: Lower temperature boilers can sometimes vaporize water faster than higher temperature boilers.

== Strong Mpemba effect ==
The possibility of a &quot;strong Mpemba effect&quot; where exponentially faster cooling can occur in a system at particular initial temperatures was predicted in 2017 by Klich, Raz, Hirschberg and Vucelja. In 2020 the strong Mpemba effect was demonstrated experimentally by Avinash Kumar and John Boechhoefer in a colloidal system.

== Quantum Mpemba effect ==
In 2024, Goold and coworkers described their quantum-mechanical analysis of an the abstract problem wherein &quot;an initially hot system is quenched into a cold bath and reaches equilibrium faster than an initially cooler system.&quot;In addition to their theoretical work, which used non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, their paper includes computational studies of spin systems which exhibit the effect. They concluded that certain initial conditions of a quantum-dynamical system can lead to a simultaneous increase in the thermalization rate and the free energy.

<doc id="440962" wikidata="Q5125754" url="?curid=440962" title="Clancy of the Overflow">
<text>&quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; is a famous Australian poem written by Banjo Paterson and first published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, an Australian news magazine, on 21 December 1889. The poem is typical of Paterson, offering a romantic view of rural life, and is one of his best-known works.

The poem is written in eight stanzas of four lines, lines one and three in a two-feet anapaest with a feminine internal rhyme, and lines two and four in trochaic octameter with masculine rhymes: AA–B–CC–B.

==History==
The poem is written from the point of view of a city-dweller who once met the title character, a shearer and drover, and now envies the imagined pleasures of Clancy&#x27;s lifestyle, which he compares favourably to life in &quot;the dusty, dirty city&quot; and &quot;the round eternal of the cashbook and the journal&quot;.

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him
In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,
And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,
And at night the wond&#x27;rous glory of the everlasting stars.&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem is possibly based on Paterson&#x27;s own experience. The introduction to &quot;Banjo Paterson&#x27;s Images of Australia&quot; by Douglas Baglin quotes Paterson as saying that he was working as a lawyer when someone asked him to send a letter to a man named Thomas Gerald Clancy, asking for a payment that had not been received. Paterson sent the letter to &quot;The Overflow&quot;, a sheep station 100 kilometres south-west of Nyngan, and received a reply that read:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Clancy&#x27;s gone to Queensland droving, and we don&#x27;t know where he are.&lt;/poem&gt;

The letter looked as though it had been written with a thumbnail dipped in tar and it is from this that Banjo Paterson found the inspiration for the poem, along with the meter.

Clancy makes a cameo appearance in another popular Banjo Paterson poem, &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;, which was first published the following year.

There are claims that Clancy was based on a man called Thomas Michael MacNamara, who described the ride with the &quot;Man from Snowy River&quot; (his brother in law Jim Troy) in an article in &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; in 1938 

In 1897, Thomas Gerald Clancy wrote a poem in reply to &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot;, entitled &quot;Clancy&#x27;s Reply&quot;, which paints a far less romantic picture of the life of a drover. There had also been a parody in 1892, &quot;The Overflow of Clancy&quot;, which formed part of the Bulletin Debate.

==Publication history==

After its original publication in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; on 21 December 1889, the poem was reprinted in numerous newspapers and magazines as well as the following anthologies and collections (among many others):

==In other media==
Clancy was portrayed by Jack Thompson in the movie &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;, and Clancy is mentioned in the musical theatre production &quot;The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular&quot; – during the recitation of the poem, Clancy is mentioned by Steve Bisley in his role of Banjo Paterson while the poem is being re-enacted in the show.

Contemporary recordings of the poem include Jack Thompson&#x27;s recitation on &quot;Jack Thompson: The Bush Poems of A.B. (Banjo) Paterson&quot; (2008) and &quot;Jack Thompson, Favourite Australian Poems, Fine Poets Collection&quot;, volume 5 (2010).

The poem &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; has also been set to music and recorded several times, including:
* John Cameron&#x27;s recording of Albert Arlen&#x27;s setting, with an orchestra conducted by George S. English (1955)
* Peter Dawson&#x27;s recording of the same setting, with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Mackerras (4 May 1955)
* In 1974 Slim Dusty released a song version on LP
* In 1980 the Australian folk group &quot;Wallis and Matilda&quot; recorded a popular song version of the poem, eventually peaking at 30 on the ARIA charts
* John Schumann of Redgum recorded it on his 1993 album &quot;True Believers&quot;
* &quot;Tenor Australis&quot; included a musical arrangement of the poem on their 1999 album &quot;Under an Australian Sky&quot;
* The fifteenth track from The Herd&#x27;s 2001 self-titled debut album, &quot;Gutter Rats&quot;, features an unknown voice repeating a line from the poem: &quot;And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting&quot;.
* The 2006 album &quot;The Overflow&quot;, by New Zealand musicians Humphreys &amp; Keen, references the poem in its title and also celebrates Paterson&#x27;s work in one of its songs, &quot;Clancy&quot;. 
* Comedian Adam Hills performed it on his ABC show &quot;Adam Hills Tonight&quot; in July 2013 as a mashup with Ali McGregor singing The Church hit &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot;
* Melbourne-based production company Yut Art produced a contemporary version in 2013.

==Proposed film==
In 2004, there were plans to make a movie of &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot;, a sequel to the 1982 film &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;, but this fell through due to financial reasons. The director was to have been Simon Wincer, who was a co-producer for &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;. Bruce Rowland (who composed the music for both the 1982 film &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; and its 1988 sequel film &quot;The Man from Snowy River II&quot;, as well as composing music for &quot;The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular&quot;, was to compose the music for the film. The film was to have been funded by private investors, but the A$22 million minimum investment was not met by the deadline of June 2004, and the film has been shelved indefinitely.

<text>HMS &quot;Dragon, also known in Polish service asORP &quot;Dragon (), was a D- or &quot;Danae&quot;-class cruiser built for the Royal Navy. She was launched in Glasgow, in December 1917, and scuttled in July 1944 off the Normandy beaches as part of the Arromanches Breakwater.

==History==

===Pre World War II===

One of the fastest-built ships of the time, &quot;Dragon&quot; (pennant number D46) was laid down on 24 January 1917 in Glasgow. She was launched on 29 December that year. However, it was not until 10 August 1918 that she was finally commissioned at Harwich Dockyard by the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Dragon&quot;. Armed with six 6-inch guns, the light cruiser was commissioned late during World War I and a Daily Mirror article of 1934 credits her South African crewman Maurice Green of firing the last shot of the war at sea when she engaged German seaplanes off Heligoland Bight on 9 November 1918. She carried the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) to Canada in August 1919 to begin a royal tour.
She then took part in the Russian Civil War as part of a task force aiding newly independent Latvia and Estonia against the Bolsheviks and German Freikorps forces in October and November 1919, as part of the British intervention in the Baltic. On 17 October 1919 &quot;Dragon&quot; was hit by three shells fired from a shore battery while taking part in operations against German forces attacking Riga, suffering nine killed and five wounded. 
From 1920 she was part of the First Light Cruiser Squadron in the Atlantic Fleet, with Captain O. H. Hawke-Genn taking over command from March that year. She recommissioned 8 May 1923 and 2 February 1926 at Chatham.

In the interbellum, in 1924, she was part of the First Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic. During 1924, she was attached to the Special Service Squadron with , , , (which would later replace &quot;Dragon&quot; in the Polish Navy) and for a variety of tasks around the world. &quot;Dragon&quot; was stationed in Zanzibar, Ceylon, New Zealand, Fiji, Canada, and Jamaica, and took part in visits to the United States, Dutch Antilles, and Australia.

On 20 December 1928, she was withdrawn from service and underwent a major refurbishment in Great Britain. Among other changes, the hangar for her seaplane was dismantled. 15 November 1929, she was given to Commander P. W. Nelles, RCN.
On 22 January 1930, the refit was completed and &quot;Dragon&quot; entered commission once more, and after undergoing trials at Chatham acted as tender to &quot;Pembroke&quot;. She was commissioned a number of times during the 1930s. On 30 May 1933 the well-known playwright, composer, director, actor and singer Noël Coward, who had arrived at the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda (the base of the America and West Indies Station) on 28 May on SS Roma, found his way on board HMS &quot;Dragon&quot;. She was then commanded by Captain Philip Louis Vian, whose first words on discovering Coward aboard were &quot;What the hell are you doing on board this ship?&quot;, though after having some gin in the Captain&#x27;s cabin Coward was allowed to stay for a cruise on the ship ending on the Pacific side of the Panama canal. HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; then headed out into the Pacific for the China Station, but was re-attached to the America and West Indies Station in 1935, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda.

In 1934, she was involved in a collision with a ship in the harbour of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, which resulted in an Admiralty action against her captain at the time, Frederic Wake-Walker. The Canadian courts found him liable for the collision. That finding of liability was upheld on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire and Commonwealth. In late October 1936 HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; attempted several times to tow the large Spanish cruise liner &quot;Cristobal Colon&quot; which had struck a reef north of Bermuda, these recovery attempts were not successful and the remains of &quot;Cristobal Colon&quot; still lie at the reef. She recommissioned with a reserve crew 16 July 1937, serving as a tender to , and in 1938-9 she formed part of the Reserve Fleet based at The Nore.

===Wartime career===

During World War II, the ship was initially attached to the 7th Cruiser Squadron of the Northern Patrol, operating in the Shetland area. In November 1939, she took part in pursuit of the . In February 1940, HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; crossed the Mediterranean and returned to the Atlantic. On 16 September 1940 she scored her first victory after capturing the French steamer &quot;Touareg&quot;. On 23 September of the same year she reached the area of the port of Dakar, where she took part in Operation Menace against the French fleet stationed there. Together with and , she sank the Vichy France submarine and took part in shelling the port. HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; then moved to Freetown, from where she operated against the in December.

Until November 1941 &quot;Dragon&quot; escorted various Atlantic convoys, after which she was moved to Asia. Following commencement of hostilities with Japan in December, she served with the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command forces, escorting convoys to Singapore, with &quot;Dragon&quot; the last ship to leave that city before it surrendered. On 20 January 1942, she was attached to the Western task force operating in the Java Sea, which included HMAS &quot;Hobart&quot;, HMS &quot;Danae&quot;, HMS &quot;Tenedos&quot; and HMS &quot;Scout&quot;. After the fall of Java, she joined and the Dutch cruiser , and operated from Ceylon. In May she was moved to Madagascar. The following month, most of the crew of the ship was landed and moved to other units, while &quot;Dragon&quot; started her voyage back to Britain for refurbishment. Since the rump crew could not operate the ship independently, she had to be attached to various convoys and it took almost half a year before she finally reached Liverpool via Cape Town, Chatham and Durban.

===Transferred to the Polish Navy===

On 15 January 1943 she was handed over to the Polish Navy, renamed ORP &quot;Dragon&quot; and manned by a Polish crew. While the name of the ship remained the same it took on a new meaning. Dragon in Polish is &quot;smok&quot;, while &quot;Dragon&quot; in Polish means Dragoon (a mounted infantry soldier) although the latter still comes in a roundabout way from dragon. Modernized in the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, she was refitted with new electric plant and installation, radar and armament. The refurbishment was finished on 23 August 1943 and the ship was moved to Scapa Flow. From there she operated as part of various convoy escorts. On 20 February 1944 she was joined by and and escorted the &quot;JW 57&quot; convoy part way to Murmansk. Upon her return she was attached to various larger ships for training of sea to land operations before the Battle of Normandy. Finally on 2 June she was attached to a flotilla composed of , , , , , &quot;Danae&quot; and 24 smaller vessels and headed for Normandy.

The ship saw action at the Normandy landings as part of Operation Neptune, shelling German shore batteries at Colleville-sur-Orne and at Trouville (Sword Beach) from a distance of four kilometres. A near miss by a German shore battery gun wounded three sailors. She withdrew under cover of &quot;Ramillies&quot; and , whose fire destroyed the battery. In the evening of D-Day she moved to Juno Beach sector, to support the advancing Allied troops. The following day the ship shelled German positions in and around the town of Caen. However, on 8 June a communication systems failure prevented the ship from further bombardment and it was not until late at night that she again opened fire against the German 21st Panzer Division near Varaville. The following day she took part in an artillery duel with a shore battery at Houlgate, after which she returned to Portsmouth for refuelling and supplies. Between 12 June and 17 June she again shelled German positions near Caen, Gouneville, Lébisey and Varaville. During that time she also evaded a torpedo attack by an unknown submarine. On 18 June she was bound for Portsmouth escorting which had been struck by a mine.

===Damage and scuttling===
On 7 July 1944 &quot;Dragon&quot; returned to the area off Caen, where she was to take part in the final artillery preparations for capturing the city after a month-long siege. At 5:40 am the following day, while waiting for the order to open fire at , the &quot;Dragon&quot; was hit by a German &quot;Neger&quot; manned torpedo, originally thought to be piloted by Walther Gerhold, and 26 men were lost.

Previously thought to have been piloted by Walther Gerhold, C.D. Bekker&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;K-Men: The Story of the German Frogmen and Midget Submarines&quot; (William Kember; London, 1955; with a preface by Hellmuth Heye, formerly Admiral of the K-Force) instead stated the Neger which attacked &quot;Dragon&quot; was piloted by Midshipman Potthast. It states that, on 13 June, a week after the Normandy landings, 40 &quot;Neger&quot; human torpedoes and their personnel, many new recruits, began a journey from Italy to Normandy. They travelled to Paris by train and then road to Normandy. Allied fighter bomber activity made it difficult to travel during daylight hours and the flotilla leader, Lieutenant Johann-Otto Krieg, was seriously wounded in one attack. Potthast, as the next most experienced pilot, took command and they finally met with Captain Friedrich Böhme, a former destroyer commander, who had been sent ahead to the Bay of the Seine to build facilities for the K-flotilla&#x27;s arrival.

According to Potthast&#x27;s report, 20 &quot;Neger&quot;s set sail in the early hours of 7 July. (Potthast had aborted a mission two nights previously due to mechanical problems.) At 03:00 a line of small patrol vessels passed by Potthast but &quot;I had no intention of wasting my torpedo on them.&quot; Some 45 minutes later he let merchant ships pass as &quot;I was determined to bag a warship&quot;. Around 04:00 he sighted a , but she turned away when some 500 yards from him, forcing him to wait. In the moonlight he then saw several warships in quarter-line formation crossing his path and he steered to attack the rear ship, which seemed larger than the others. At a distance of 300 yards Potthast pulled the torpedo firing lever and he actioned a post-attack escape. The explosion, so close by, almost &quot;hurled his &quot;neger&quot; out of the water&quot;. &quot;A sheet of flame shot upwards from the stricken ship. Almost at once I was enveloped in thick smoke and I lost all sense of direction. When the smoke cleared I saw that the warship&#x27;s stern had been blown away.&quot; Other vessels counterattacked, firing wildly as they could not see Potthast, but he managed to evade them. Later, two frigates passed close by Potthast but they did not spot him.

After more than six hours in his cramped cockpit Potthast was severely fatigued. He eventually fell asleep and in the morning light a corvette attacked with gunfire from around 100 yards off. Potthast managed to get out of the &quot;Neger&quot; as the gunfire disabled the craft. With blood pouring from an arm wound he collapsed, but the corvette crew rescued him with a boathook and rope looped under his arms. He was taken to the sick-bay and given tea and biscuits. Later flown to an English hospital, Potthast was interrogated by military intelligence and although confronted with maps and details of K-flotilla deployments he refused to confirm or deny anything. Bekker states &quot;After six weeks they gave up, then suddenly told him that he had himself been responsible for the sinking of the 5,000-ton cruiser &quot;Dragon&quot;. ...All this cheered up the prisoner, who felt that his arduous training had not been wasted after all&quot;.

The explosion caused a fire in the 3rd magazine, which had to be filled with water, and the 3rd engine was also hit. The ship started to sink on her port side and the angle of list reached 9°, but the situation was stabilized by the captain, who ordered all the turrets to train their barrels to starboard. Although an additional 11 sailors died of wounds, the situation was stabilized and the ship was moved to shallows, where she was to await the ebb tide. After the water was pumped out of the flooded engine room, it was discovered that the hull was pierced across two sections and the hole was approximately by . Although still afloat and repairable, it was decided that the ship be abandoned. On 10 July, aided &quot;Dragon&quot; by transporting 17 of her officers and 320 of her enlisted men from Normandy to England. Until 15 July the remaining rump crew dismantled the armament. An additional two bodies were found in the ship, and the dead were buried at sea. On 16 July she was decommissioned and then towed to Mulberry &quot;B&quot;, where on 20 July she was scuttled to form part of the artificial breakwater near Courseulles. On 4 October 1944, she was replaced in Polish service with ORP &quot;Conrad&quot;, formerly HMS &quot;Dragon&quot;″ sister ship .

<text>HMS &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; was the lead ship of the armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the early 1900s. She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser and light cruiser . After the German ships reached Ottoman waters, the ship was sent to the Red Sea in mid-August to protect troop convoys arriving from India. &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; was transferred to the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and participated in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. She was not damaged during the battle and was the only ship of her squadron to survive. She was eventually transferred to the Atlantic Ocean in August 1917 for convoy escort duties. The ship was sold for scrap in 1920.

==Description==
&quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; displaced as built and fully loaded. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by a pair of four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by 20 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers and 6 cylindrical boilers. The engines produced a total of that was designed to give a maximum speed of . The ship carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . The ship&#x27;s complement was 789 officers and ratings.

===Armament===
Her main armament consisted of six BL Mk X guns in single turrets. The guns were distributed in two centreline turrets (one each fore and one aft) and four turrets disposed in the corners about the funnels. Her secondary armament of ten BL Mk XI guns was arranged in single casemates. They were mounted amidships on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. Twenty Vickers quick-firing (QF) three-pounders () were fitted, six on turret roofs and fourteen in the superstructure. The ship also mounted three submerged  torpedo tubes.

== Construction and career ==

&quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; was ordered under the 1902/1903 naval construction programme as the lead ship of her class. She was laid down on 11 February 1903 at Pembroke Royal Dockyard in Wales. She was launched on 14 June 1904 and completed on 20 January 1906 at a cost of £1,193,414. The ship was named after Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s sons.

The ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron from 1906 to 1908 and was then transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. When the Royal Navy&#x27;s cruiser squadrons were reorganized in 1909, &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; rejoined the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. On 13 August 1910 &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; ran aground on Atherfield Ledge, Isle of Wight. She was successfully refloated, but in the resulting Court-martial to investigate the incident, the ship&#x27;s Captain and Navigating Officer were severely reprimanded and the latter dismissed from the ship. She helped to rescue the survivors of the SS &quot;Delhi&quot; which ran aground off the coast of Morocco in December 1911. From 1913 to 1914 she served with the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet.

When the British began to prepare for war in July 1914, the ship was refitting at Malta. Her refit was cut short and she joined the rest of her squadron in the southern approaches to the Adriatic. She was involved in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and light cruiser &quot;Breslau&quot; at the outbreak of World War I, but was ordered not to engage them. On 10 August &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; and her sister ship were ordered to the Red Sea to protect troop convoys arriving from India. While on that duty the ship captured the German merchantman &quot;Altair&quot; of 3,200 tons GRT on 15 August. While escorting a troop convoy from India to France in November 1914, &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; provided cover to three battalions of infantry that seized the Turkish fort at Cheikh Saïd at the entrance to the Red Sea. The ship then landed a demolition party, which blew the fort up on 10 November; she then rejoined the convoy.

&quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which had been transferred to the Grand Fleet in the meantime, in December 1914. In March 1916 the ship had her main deck 6-inch guns removed and the openings plated over. Six of the guns were remounted on the upper deck, three on each side, between the wing turrets, protected by gun shields. At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, the 1st Cruiser Squadron was in front of the Grand Fleet, on the right side. At 5:47 p.m. The two leading ships of the squadron, the flagship, , and , spotted the German II Scouting Group and opened fire. Their shells felt short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser , which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; could not follow the first two ships and turned to port (northeast). The ship spotted the disabled German light cruiser at 6:08 and fired twenty rounds at her. By about 6:30 she had steamed to a position off the starboard bow of , the leading ship of the 2nd Battle Squadron, where her funnel smoke obscured the German ships from the foremost dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron. A torpedo attack by German destroyers on Admiral Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, failed, but forced &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; to evade one torpedo at 6:47. The ship reported a submarine sighting at 7:01, although no German submarines were operating in the area. She fired at another false submarine contact between 7:45 and 8:15.

After the battle, &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; was attached to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and remained at sea until 2 June, searching for disabled ships. She arrived in Scapa Flow on the afternoon of 3 June. On the evening of 18 August 1916, the Grand Fleet, including &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot;, put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. After Jutland the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, now including &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot;, was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders. The ship&#x27;s foremast was converted to a tripod to support the weight of a fire-control director in May 1917, but when the director was actually fitted is not known. Two more 6-inch guns were added in embrasures on the forecastle deck during that same refit. She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties, where she remained for the duration of the war. Upon her return, &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; was stationed in the Humber, before she was sold for scrap on 12 April 1920 and broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.

<doc id="440975" wikidata="Q1142229" url="?curid=440975" title="HMS Duke of Wellington (1852)">
<text>HMS &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot; was a 131-gun first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. Launched in 1852, she was symptomatic of an era of rapid technological change in the navy, being powered both by sail and steam. An early steam-powered ship, she was still fitted with towering masts and trim square-set yards, and was the flagship of Sir Charles Napier.

==Design and construction==
First christened HMS &quot;Windsor Castle&quot;, she was the first of a class of four that represented the ultimate development of the wooden three-decker ship of the line which had been the mainstay capital ship in naval warfare for 200 years. She was originally ordered in 1841 to a design of Sir William Symonds, the Surveyor of the Navy, but was not laid down until May 1849 at Pembroke Dock by which time Symonds had resigned and the design had been modified by the Assistant Surveyor John Edye. At this stage the ship was still intended as a sailing vessel. Although the Royal Navy had been using steam power in smaller ships for three decades, it had not been adopted for ships of the line, partly because the enormous paddle-boxes required would have meant a severe reduction in the number of guns carried. This problem was solved by the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s. Under a crash programme announced in December 1851 to provide the navy with a steam-driven battlefleet, the design was further modified by the new Surveyor, Captain Baldwin Walker. The ship was cut apart in two places on the stocks in January 1852, lengthened by 30 feet (9.1 m) overall and given screw propulsion. She received the 780 hp engines designed and built by Robert Napier and Sons for the iron frigate &quot;Simoon&quot;, which had surrendered them on conversion to a troopship. The ship was launched on 14 September 1852. On that day the Duke of Wellington died, and she was subsequently re-named in his honour and provided with a new figurehead in the image of the duke.

==Service history==
When completed on 4 February 1853, HMS &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot; was, on paper at least, the most powerful warship in the world (and would remain so until the completion of the French &quot;Bretagne&quot; in 1855) and the largest yet built for the Royal Navy, twice the size of Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Victory&quot; and with a far bigger broadside. She was 240 feet (73.1 m) long, displaced 5,892 tons, and carried 131 cannon, weighing a total of 382 tons and mainly firing 32 lb balls.

After service in the Western Squadron of the Channel Fleet, she was designated the flagship of the fleet that Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Napier was to lead to the Baltic on the outbreak of the war with Russia (later known as the Crimean War). &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot; served as his flagship throughout the Baltic campaign of 1854 and returned to the Baltic the following year as the flagship of Napier’s successor in the command, Rear-Admiral Richard Saunders Dundas, being present at the bombardment of Sveaborg.
Under trials on 11 April 1853 she had made 10.15 knots under steam, but the second-hand engines turned out distinctly unsatisfactory, and the hurried conversion had compromised her structural strength; she thus saw no active service after the Crimean War and paid off in 1856. She served as guard ship of sailing ordinary at Devonport from 1860 to 1863, then as a receiving ship at Portsmouth from 1863, where she became a familiar and much-photographed sight, always described on postcards as &quot;the flagship of Sir Charles Napier&quot;. She replaced as flagship of the Port Admiral at Portsmouth in 1869 (with &quot;Victory&quot; becoming her tender), firing salutes to passing dignitaries, such as Queen Victoria on her way to Osborne House. On 4 February 1879, a fire broke out at the fore of the ship. It was extinguished with the assistance of two tugs. She served as flagship for the Commander-in-Chief from 24 October 1884
to 1886 and for Victoria&#x27;s birthday celebration and fleet review at Portsmouth in 1896 &quot;dressed smartly for the occasion&quot; (despite having been paid off on 31 March 1888).

==Fate==
The personnel stationed on her eventually moved into RN Barracks Portsmouth in 1903 and she was finally sold to be broken up in 1904.

Ship&#x27;s timbers discovered on the Thames foreshore at Charlton have been identified as being from the &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot;.

==Sister ships==
Of her three sisters, all of which received more powerful machinery specially designed for them:
*HMS &quot;Marlborough&quot; was completed to a modified design and served as flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet from 1858–64; thereafter she too was a receiving ship at Portsmouth, renamed &quot;Vernon II&quot;, surviving until broken up in 1924.
*HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was completed to the same design as &quot;Marlborough&quot; in 1860 but saw no sea service; in 1869 she was renamed &quot;Britannia&quot; and became the stationary training ship for officer cadets on the River Dart.
*HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was completed to the same design as the &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot; but was cut down to the lower deck and converted in 1862-4 into the first British turret ship to try out the ideas of Captain Cowper Phipps Coles. She was fitted with four turrets mounting 9 inch muzzle-loading rifled guns. She was regarded as primarily experimental and her longest voyage was to Cherbourg in 1865 before becoming the tender to the gunnery school HMS &quot;Excellent&quot;. She was scrapped in 1885.

The Imperial Russian Navy built a ship of its own based on the &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot;, the &quot;Imperator Nikolai I&quot;.

<doc id="440976" wikidata="Q2462915" url="?curid=440976" title="Canadian Armed Forces ranks and insignia">
<text>This is a table of the ranks and insignia of the Canadian Armed Forces. As the Canadian Armed Forces is officially bilingual, the French language ranks are presented following the English (in italics).

== Commander-in-Chief insignia ==
According to &quot;Canadian Forces Dress Instructions&quot;, the Monarch or their representative (the Governor General) may wear the uniform and corresponding cap/hat badge of a flag/general officer, with a special flag/general officer sleeve braid embellished with the governor general&#x27;s badge, and a large embroidered governor general&#x27;s badge on the shoulder straps or boards, facing forward.
== Officer rank insignia ==
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.

&lt;dfn&gt;Officers&lt;/dfn&gt; in the CAF hold positions of authority and respect. They are responsible for the safety, well-being and morale of a group of soldiers, sailors, air men or air women. Analyzing, planning, making decisions and providing advice are a few aspects of an Officer’s role.
=== Student officer ranks ===
== Non-commissioned member (NCM) rank insignia ==
The following are the rank insignia for non-commissioned members for the navy, army and air force respectively.

&lt;dfn&gt;Non-Commissioned Members&lt;/dfn&gt; are skilled personnel who provide operational and support services in the CAF. Non-Commissioned Members start out as recruits and are trained to do specific jobs.

NCM rank insignia for the rank of petty officer 1st class/warrant officer and above are worn on the lower sleeve, while those for the rank of petty officer 2nd class/sergeant and below are worn on the upper sleeve. The Royal Canadian Navy has directed its personnel to use the English rank titles for OR-1 through OR-5, but they are not yet legally in force pursuant to the National Defence Act, as they are not yet updated in the King&#x27;s Regulations and Orders issued by the governor-in-council.
=== Appointments ===
The rank insignia for NCM appointments.
== Rank slip-ons ==
The tables above describe the rank insignia worn on the service dress jacket. On DEU shirts, sweaters, and outerwear; and operational dress shirts and jackets, rank insignia are worn on slip-ons with the word &quot;Canada&quot; or a regimental/branch title embroidered underneath. Flag/general officers&#x27; slip-ons include only the crown, crossed sabre and baton, and maple leaves worn on the shoulder straps; they do not include the braid worn on the sleeve. Army NCM slip-ons for DEU shirts, sweaters, and outerwear display only the word &quot;Canada&quot; or a regimental/branch title, rank insignia being worn instead as enamelled metal pins on collar points or lapels.

== Service stripes ==
From 1955 to 1968, Militia personnel were permitted to wear service insignia on the right jacket sleeve. There were one to five silver chevrons on drab backing for every two years of service or a maple leaf in silver thread on a drab cloth circle to represent 10 years of service. Chevron points were worn either up or down; even official documents and photos were confused on the matter. Further awards after 10 years were believed covered by the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration, which was awarded after 12 years and a clasp added for every 10 years afterwards.

Qualifying service could include prior active service in the active reserves of the Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force or the regular or territorial forces of a fellow Commonwealth member nation. Service in Canadian Army reserve forces units (like the regular reserve, supplementary reserve and reserve militia) did not count. The awarding of Service Stripes ceased in 1968 after the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces.

== Canadian Army distinctive corps insignia ==
Every branch or corps of the Canadian Army uses a distinctive colour. Applicable only to officers, they are indicated by coloured borders of rank insignia on DEU shirt and sweater slip-ons and on mess dress.
=== Distinctive rank names ===
Some branches and regiments use distinctive job titles for privates (trained) in those regiments:

Additionally, the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery uses &quot;bombardier&quot; ( or ) for corporal and &quot;master bombardier&quot; ( or ) for master corporal. In the guards regiments, warrant officers are known as &quot;colour sergeants&quot; () and second-lieutenants are known as &quot;ensigns&quot; ().

== Evolution of Royal Canadian Navy rank and insignia ==
When the Royal Canadian Navy was established in 1910, it kept with Royal Navy traditions and adopted sleeve braid with an executive curl for rank insignia. &quot;Wavy&quot; sleeve braid was adopted for the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) and rings of narrow interwoven gold lace for the Royal Canadian Navy Reserve (RCNR). Other variations in rank insignia included sky blue lace with a diamond shaped loop for officers of the Women&#x27;s Royal Canadian Naval Service, and warranted Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps officers, who had a small anchor in place of the executive curl.

Following the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy was reorganized with a single reserve component. In 1946, the distinctive wavy gold braid of the reserves gave way to the straight braided executive curl of the regular force until 1968. With the integration of the Canadian Forces the sea element was designated as Canadian Forces Maritime Command. Unembellished straight braid became the common rank insignia for officers of both the regular and reserve forces. The executive curl appeared only on navy mess dress.

On 5 March 2010, the Canadian House of Commons passed a motion (moved by Guy Lauzon) recommending the executive curl be reinstated on the Canadian navy uniform. Subsequently, in recognition of the Canadian Naval centennial, Peter MacKay, Minister of National Defence, authorized the use of the executive curl for the Canadian Navy on 2 May 2010. The insignia became effective on 11 June 2010, on the occasion of the Pacific Canadian Naval International Fleet Review parade of nations in Victoria, B.C.

More than 54 countries, including Canada and 18 other of the 22 Commonwealth navies, use the insignia. Most navies that do not use the executive curl insignia, such as the United States Navy and the French Navy, substitute a star or other national device above the top row of lace.

=== Timeline of changes (sleeves only) ===


== Evolution of Canadian Army ranks and insignia ==
Prior to unification in 1968, the Canadian Army used rank insignia identical to the British Army. When the universal CF green uniform was adopted at unification, Land Command, like the other services, used gold braid sleeve stripes as rank insignia. When distinctive environmental uniforms were adopted in the mid-1980s, the army retained the green uniform with gold stripes. 

On 8 July 2013, Minister of National Defence Peter MacKay announced the intention to reintroduce a more traditional style Canadian Army officers&#x27; rank insignia. Instead of the sleeve stripe rank insignia used since unification, officers would use the older St Edward&#x27;s Crown and Star of the Order of the Bath insignia, commonly called &quot;pips and crowns&quot;. Gorget patches were also restored for officers of the rank of colonel or higher. The new insignia for officers, instead of using the current British rank insignia for brigadier (used in the Canadian Army until 1968), had the pre-1920 brigadier-general insignia (crossed sabre and baton) instead.

On 2 April 2016, the Commander of the Canadian Army announced that general officers would revert to the unification-era rank insignia worn between 1968 and 2013. This rank insignia is based on the shoulder board rank insignia of Royal Canadian Navy flag officers. The rank insignia of general officers now consists of a crown, crossed sabre and baton, and a series of maple leaves on shoulder straps. Additionally, general officers wear one broad gold band on each of the lower sleeves of the service dress tunic.

On the centenary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, 9 April 2017, the Bath Star pip was replaced by the &quot;Vimy Star&quot;. It depicts a maple leaf and is surrounded by the Latin motto (&quot;we stand on guard for thee&quot;). Commissioned officers of the household guard regiments (Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, Canadian Grenadier Guards, and Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards), plus Army personnel stationed to the seasonal Ceremonial Guard, use the Guards Star in place of the Vimy Star on their shoulder boards.

=== Timeline of changes ===


== Evolution of Royal Canadian Air Force rank and insignia ==
Canadian Air Force ranks and insignia originally were taken from the Royal Air Force practice. Upon unification, the Air Command used identical ranks and insignia as the Land Command. When Air-specific blue DEUs were introduced, the gold rank insignia were retained.

In April 2015, the Royal Canadian Air Force adopted new rank insignia reminiscent of the pre-unification RCAF system. The new officer rank insignia uses pearl-grey-on-black rank stripes instead of gold. Non-commissioned members (NCMs) rank insignia is pearl grey instead of gold. The colour gold found elsewhere on the uniform was also changed to pearl-grey. The air force rank of private, formerly indicated by one chevron, became aviator (Fr: &quot;aviateur&quot;), and is indicated by a horizontally-aligned two-bladed propeller. All other ranks titles remain as they were.

=== Timeline of changes ===


=== Mess dress ===
Contrary to the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army, mess dress uniform ranks for officers of the Royal Canadian Air Force follow the naval pattern, without the executive curl. General officers do not wear shoulder straps with this order of dress.

<doc id="440980" wikidata="Q5326202" url="?curid=440980" title="Earl of Balcarres">
<text>Earl of Balcarres is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, created in 1651 for Alexander Lindsay, 2nd Lord Balcarres. Since 1848, the title has been held jointly with the Earldom of Crawford, and the holder is also the hereditary clan chief of Clan Lindsay.

The first earl&#x27;s father was created Lord Lindsay of Balcarres on 27 June 1633. He was the grandson of the 9th Earl of Crawford. The second Lord Lindsay succeeded his father in 1642. A prominent supporter of Charles I, he was further elevated as Earl of Balcarres and Lord Lindsay of Balneil in 1651. During the rule of Oliver Cromwell, the first earl died in exile in Breda in 1659.

He was succeeded by Charles, his third but first surviving son, who in turn was succeeded by his younger brother, the third earl. In his youth, the third earl was a courtier of King Charles II after the restoration of the monarchy, but later became devoted to King James VII. He fled to Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye after the Glorious Revolution when it was discovered he was part of a plot to restore James to the English throne. He returned to Scotland around 1701 and was received at the court of Queen Anne. He was stripped of his annuity during the revolution, but not his titles.

In January 1808, the ancient Earldom of Crawford, held by members of another branch of the Lindsay family since 1398, became dormant after the death of the George Lindsay-Crawford, 22nd Earl of Crawford. In 1843, James Lindsay, 7th Earl of Balcarres, put forward his claim, based on the research of his eldest son Alexander. In 1848, the House of Lords allowed the claim. It was held that the seventh Earl&#x27;s father, the sixth Earl, was the lawful (&quot;de jure&quot;) successor to the earldom of Crawford (though he did not claim it). Therefore, the sixth Earl of Balcarres was posthumously declared the twenty-third Earl of Crawford, and his son, the seventh Earl of Balcarres, became the twenty-fourth Earl of Crawford. Thereafter, the two earldoms have remained united.

The family seat is Balcarres House, near Colinsburgh, Fife.

<doc id="440981" wikidata="Q3182037" url="?curid=440981" title="John McCallum">
<text>John McCallum (born 9 April 1950) is a Canadian politician, economist, diplomat and former university professor. A former Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), McCallum was the Canadian Ambassador to China from 2017 to 2019. He was asked for his resignation by Prime Minister Trudeau in 2019. As an MP, he represented the electoral district of Markham—Thornhill, and had previously represented Markham—Unionville and Markham. He is a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

A veteran federal politician who began his political career in 2000, McCallum has served in the governments of Liberal prime ministers Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin, and Justin Trudeau. McCallum has previously been Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Minister of National Defence, Minister of Veterans Affairs, and Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship.

== Early life and education ==
McCallum was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Joan (Patteson) and Alexander Campbell McCallum. He received his secondary education at Selwyn House School and Trinity College School. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge University, a &quot;diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures&quot; from &quot;Université de Paris I&quot; and a PhD degree in economics from McGill University.

== Academic career (1976–1994) ==
McCallum was a professor of economics at the University of Manitoba from 1976 until 1978, Simon Fraser University from 1978 until 1982, the &quot;Université du Québec à Montréal&quot; from 1982 until 1987, and McGill University from 1987 until 1994. He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, student .

He was also dean of the faculty of arts at McGill University, when his future boss, Justin Trudeau was a student there. He then became senior vice-president and chief economist of the Royal Bank of Canada.

One of his most influential academic contributions was an article in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, which introduced the concept of the home bias in trade puzzle. It has spawned an ongoing international debate on whether trade within a nation state is greater than trade among nations, as compared with the predictions of standard economic models.

As McGill University&#x27;s dean of arts, McCallum secured a $10 million contribution from Charles Bronfman for the establishment of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.

He also participated in the national unity debates of the early 1990s, editing the Canada Round Series of the C. D. Howe Institute and engaging in debate with then Opposition Leader Jacques Parizeau at Quebec&#x27;s National Assembly.

== Private sector career (1994–2000; 2019 onward) ==
McCallum was the Royal Bank of Canada&#x27;s chief economist for six years. He consistently achieved the highest media coverage of bank chief economists, making regular appearances on CBC&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot; as an economics panellist. He also engaged in social issues, notably a 1997 Royal Bank conference designed to align the business community with the recommendations of the 1996 Report on the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. His paper at that conference, &quot;The Cost of Doing Nothing&quot;, was highlighted ten years later in the &quot;Aboriginal Times&quot; magazine.

In July 2020, McCallum&#x27;s employment by the Wailian Group, a Chinese company that assists with immigration to Canada, sparked calls from oppositions MPs and Democracy Watch for McCullum to be investigated by the Ethics Commissioner for potential breaches of the Conflict of Interest Act.

== Political career ==
=== Member of Parliament (2000–2017) ===
McCallum successfully nominated Nelson Mandela as the second honorary citizen in Canadian history.

McCallum was quite vocal in Canada&#x27;s debate on same-sex marriage. He told the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot; in August 2003, &quot;If people want to do something and it doesn&#x27;t hurt other people, doesn&#x27;t reduce other people&#x27;s rights, we should let them do it. Why not?&quot; He also significantly contributed to the final debate before the vote on same-sex marriage on 21 March 2005 saying:
I believe we should always seek to expand the rights of our fellow citizens as long as we do not thereby reduce the rights of others. We should seek to ensure that no group is denied full participation in society. As members of Parliament, we should not ask the question, why should we extend this right? Rather our question should be, why should we not extend the right? Let the burden of proof be on those who wish to limit fundamental rights.
Many Canadians will want to accept both of these principles: protect the traditional definition of marriage and protect the rights of minorities. The essence of my message today is that we cannot do both. We cannot have it both ways. We must make a choice between traditional marriage and the protection of minority rights.

=== Defence Minister (2002–2003) ===
As Defence Minister under Jean Chrétien, McCallum achieved what was then the largest increase in the annual defence budget ($1 billion) in more than a decade in return for offering up $200 million in savings from reducing low priority spending. He also retroactively reversed an inequity which awarded up to $250,000 to military personnel who lost their eyesight or a limb while on active service - but only to those with the rank of colonel or above. Now all Canadian Forces members are covered by the plan regardless of rank. Working with Germany, he successfully persuaded NATO to take control over the security mission in Kabul, Afghanistan, while also ensuring that the mission was led by Canada. He also determined that the army, rather than the navy or air force, was to be the top priority in budget allocations.

He became widely known and criticized in 2002 when he admitted, while serving as the Minister of National Defence, that he had never heard of the 1942 Dieppe raid, a fateful and nationally significant operation for Canadian Forces during the Second World War. Ironically, he wrote a letter to the editor of the National Post in response, but committed a further gaffe, confusing Canadian participation in the 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge in France with Vichy France from 1940 to 1944. Response at the continued historical ignorance prompted outrage and humour among the press.

In November 2002, while still serving as Defence Minister, McCallum encountered further controversy when officials refused to allow him to board an Air Canada flight because his breath smelt heavily of alcohol. McCallum announced soon thereafter that the incident prompted him to abstain completely from alcohol consumption. He reportedly also intended to lose weight and give up smoking.

In January 2003, McCallum suggested Canadian troops could avoid so-called &quot;friendly fire&quot; incidents by wearing some of female Conservative MP Elsie Wayne&#x27;s clothes. McCallum later apologized both inside and outside the House of Commons for using inappropriate language, blaming the excitement of the moment, and had his apologies accepted by Wayne.

===Veterans Affairs Minister (2003–2004)===
Under Paul Martin, McCallum introduced a new charter for younger, postwar veterans who have been physically or mentally injured while serving in the Canadian Forces. This charter, which became law in 2005, is modelled on the range of services provided for returning veterans after World War II. This &quot;new model&quot; stripped veterans of a monthly pension opting for a lump sum payment.

=== Revenue Minister (2004–2006) ===
As Minister of National Revenue and Chair of the Cabinet&#x27;s Expenditure Review Committee, McCallum achieved in 2005 expenditure reductions of $11 billion over the next five years.

=== Shadow Cabinet Immigration Critic (2006–2015) ===
When the Conservatives came to power in January 2006 under Stephen Harper, McCallum was appointed as the Immigration Critic. During his time in the opposition, Mr. McCallum began to travel extensively to China at the expense of Beijing-friendly groups. McCallum took trips valued at $73,300 from pro-Beijing business groups, such as the Canadian Confederation of Fujian Associations.

=== Immigration Minister (2015–2017) ===
On 4 November 2015, he was appointed the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship in the newly elected 29th Canadian Ministry of Justin Trudeau. As a senior cabinet minister, McCallum was then fourth in line in case of the PM&#x27;s incapacity. As Immigration Minister, he oversaw the intake of Syrian refugees during the Syrian refugee crisis.

=== Ambassador to China (2017–2019) ===
On 10 January 2017, it was announced that McCallum would be appointed as Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to China. This resulted in a cabinet reshuffle as he stepped down from his position as the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship to pursue his new post. McCallum expressed eagerness to take on the posting in Beijing, citing his strong personal connections to China, as his former riding Markham has primarily Chinese constituents and both his wife and children are of Chinese ethnicity.

On 23 January 2019, McCallum spoke to Chinese-language Canadian and state-owned Chinese media in Markham, Ontario, concerning the detention and extradition request by the United States, which resulted in the arrest of Huawei deputy chairwoman Meng Wanzhou, who was awaiting court judgement. The United States alleged that Meng Wanzhou was in violation of the United States sanctions against Iran. The Canadian Federal government reaffirmed that it is obliged to follow judicial protocol and that the arrest was not political in nature. McCallum shared his thoughts with the media by restating public facts that could make Meng&#x27;s legal defence case strong against this extradition request. This included President Donald Trump&#x27;s political intrusion, which allegedly undermined the integrity of the Canadian judicial protocol, thereby contradicting Canada&#x27;s stance by making it political in nature. McCallum re-stated other reported motives the United States could have, citing the alleged intent of the arrest by the United States was to attempt to obtain trade concessions from China. McCallum withdrew his comments, saying he &quot;misspoke&quot; and that they did &quot;not accurately represent position on this issue&quot;. That week, McCallum was further quoted as later telling a Toronto Star journalist it &quot;would be great for Canada&quot; if the US extradition request were dropped, conditional on release of Canadians since detained in China.

On 26 January 2019, McCallum submitted his resignation as ambassador to China, at the request of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who did not disclose the reasoning behind this decision.

== Family ==
He is married to Nancy Lim, who is of Malaysian Chinese background (). They have three sons (Andrew, Jamie, and Duncan).

<doc id="440994" wikidata="Q2366344" url="?curid=440994" title="Knuckles' Chaotix">
<text>Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix is a 1995 platform game developed by Sega for the 32X. A spin-off from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, it features Knuckles the Echidna and four other characters known as the Chaotix, who must prevent Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic from obtaining six magic rings and conquering a mysterious island. The gameplay is similar to previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games: players complete levels while collecting rings and defeating enemies. &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; introduces a partner system whereby the player is connected to another character via a tether; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be used to maneuver the characters.

While Sonic Team is sometimes credited with creating &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;, it was developed by another Sega team. Production began with &quot;Sonic Crackers&quot;, a 1994 prototype for the Sega Genesis which experimented with the tethering system and featured Sonic and Tails. &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; was planned as a &quot;Sonic&quot; game for the Sega Saturn, but transitioned to the 32X when it could not be completed in time. Sonic and Tails were replaced by Knuckles and a group of mostly pre-existing characters; Mighty the Armadillo first appeared in the arcade game &quot;SegaSonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1993).

&quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; was released in North America and Japan in April 1995, and in Europe in June 1995. It received mixed contemporary reviews and failed commercially. Reviewers found the tethering physics cumbersome, although some appreciated it as an attempt to innovate. The level design and low difficulty level were also criticized. Journalists have described &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; as the last of the &quot;classic&quot; 2D &quot;Sonic&quot; games before the series moved to 3D. Some characters and concepts it introduced feature in later &quot;Sonic&quot; games and media, beginning with &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; in 2003. Despite interest from fans, it has not been rereleased beyond a brief period through GameTap in the mid-2000s.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; is a side-scrolling platform game similar to earlier entries in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. Unlike other &quot;Sonic&quot; games, players are tethered to a computer or human-controlled partner; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be properly handled to maneuver through stages. There are five playable characters, each with their own unique abilities. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls; Mighty the Armadillo can perform a wall jump; Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings; Vector the Crocodile can boost through the air and climb walls; and Charmy Bee can fly and hover. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players&#x27; progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story takes place on a mysterious island and follows the group&#x27;s efforts to stop Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic from harnessing the power of the island&#x27;s mythical Chaos Rings to satisfy their evil deeds.

The game takes place over six levels called attractions. Each attraction is divided into five acts; the fifth ends in a boss fight with Robotnik and one of his large robots. Each act has a different time of day decor, such as morning, noon, evening, and night. Like earlier &quot;Sonic&quot; games, players collect rings, jump to perform a spin attack to defeat enemies, and can perform a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. Power-ups include rings, shields, and speed shoes. The partner system enables players to perform actions not seen in earlier &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Players can call their partner if they are separated, which reunites them with the main character but costs 10 rings, or throw their partner to reach far platforms. If the partner is computer-controlled, the player can stop and anchor the partner to perform special moves such as &quot;snapping&quot; to a higher ledge or thrusting to gain speed.

Before entering a stage, the player begins in a hub world where they choose a partner and level. Bonus stages are hidden throughout attractions, and can also be triggered by obtaining 20 or more rings and finding one of the giant golden rings hidden away in each level. In the bonus levels, the player is free-falling and picks up power-ups. Special stages are reached by finishing a level with 50 or more rings. In these stages, the player collects blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer to earn a Chaos Ring. Collecting all Chaos Rings unlocks the &quot;good&quot; ending, in which Sonic and Tails are seen with the Chaotix, who have freed the island from Robotnik.

==Development==

Although Sonic Team is sometimes credited for developing &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;, it was developed by another internal Sega team, including staff who had worked on &quot;Sonic CD&quot; (1993). Development began around April 1994 for the Sega Genesis as an engine test, with the working title &quot;Sonic Crackers&quot;. The prototype featured Sonic and Tails joined by an elastic band of energy; the name likely comes from clackers, a toy comprising two balls connected by string. According to the journalist Ken Horowitz, &quot;Sonic Crackers&quot; was most likely a ROM made to demonstrate new concepts to management. Some ideas were used in &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; (1996), while the level design, tethering, and some music resurfaced in &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;.

Sega eventually moved development to the Genesis&#x27; more powerful 32X add-on. According to Horowitz, this was because the 16-bit era of consoles was coming to an end. Former Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske recalled that &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; was once intended for the Genesis&#x27; successor, the Sega Saturn, as a mainline &quot;Sonic&quot; game. According to Kalinske, development moved to the 32X when it became clear that the game would not be ready for the Saturn launch; Kalinske said it was &quot;too big, it was taking too long, it was over budgeted, it was behind schedule&quot;. Because Sega needed new 32X games, Sega decided to downsize the game and introduce it quickly on 32X.

By December 1994, Sonic and Tails had been removed and the game had been reworked to star Knuckles the Echidna, who had been introduced in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994). The project had the working title &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Ringstar&quot;. The game also adds the characters Mighty the Armadillo, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee. Mighty had appeared in the arcade game &quot;SegaSonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1993); many of Sonic&#x27;s animations from &quot;Crackers&quot; were repurposed for Mighty. Vector the Crocodile was created for the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991) but scrapped before release, and Charmy Bee originally appeared in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; manga. &quot;Sonic&quot; co-creator Naoto Ohshima said he was responsible for repurposing Vector and Charmy, but otherwise had no involvement with &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;.

Espio was the only original character, designed by manga artist Takumi Miyake. A leaked prototype lists Espio as the featured character on the title screen instead of Knuckles, suggesting he once featured more prominently, possibly in a starring role. The 32X&#x27;s processing power allowed for dynamic sprite-scaling effects, and 3D polygons in the special stages. A complex palette system allowed each level to load unique colors. The music was composed by Junko Shiratsu and Mariko Nanba.

== Release ==
&quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; was released in North America in April 1995, in Japan on April 21, 1995, and in Europe in June 23, 1995. According to Horowitz, the game was rushed to help boost sluggish 32X sales. It quickly faded into obscurity, and is now considered a valuable collector&#x27;s item due to the 32X&#x27;s commercial failure. The only rerelease came in 2005, when &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; was briefly made available for Mac OS X and Windows computers via the subscription service GameTap.

The &quot;Sonic Crackers&quot; prototype ROM was leaked online by a Belgian hacking group in June 1995 and can be played with emulators. A cartridge version was auctioned for $146.50 in 2001. While some fans speculated that the &quot;Sonic Crackers&quot; ROM was an April Fools&#x27; Day hoax, its authenticity has been corroborated by multiple sources, including references in an internal Sega design document and text found in a later &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; prototype.

== Reception ==

&quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; received mixed reviews, and failed commercially, as did the 32X.

The game&#x27;s presentation divided critics. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) praised its graphics and believed the game was one of the best for the 32X, and &quot;GameFan&quot; considered &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; the best entry in the franchise since &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992). On the other hand, a reviewer from &quot;Next Generation&quot; found the graphics garish, and felt that the game made &quot;unimpressive attempts to show off&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot;, &quot;Game Players&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot; believed the game failed to push the 32X to its limits, citing the lack of graphical effects and Genesis-quality audio, though &quot;IGN&quot; felt some elements, such as several musical tracks, were highlights. In 2008, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; wrote that &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; was the best game for the 32X and was underrated, though it still considered the game a &quot;wasted opportunity&quot;.

The &quot;rubber band&quot; multiplayer system was criticized, despite being acknowledged as an effort to innovate. Though &quot;IGN&quot; admired the attempt to &quot;breathe life into a series that was running out of steam&quot; and fix the lopsided multiplayer of &quot;Sonic 2&quot; and &quot;Sonic 3&quot; (1994), whereby Tails would get lost off-screen, they felt the physics were &quot;clunky&quot; and unorthodox. &quot;EGM&quot; felt the system was original, but slowed down the gameplay, as did &quot;GamesRadar&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; felt the bond was tiring and not truly innovative, and &quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;″s biggest flaw, finding it frustrating and choppy. The reviewer also found that the bond complicated gameplay and compared it to being handcuffed.

The level design and low difficulty were also criticized. &quot;GamePro&quot; wrote that the levels, while fairly large, were not populated with enough enemies or secrets, a sentiment echoed by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; considered the boss design simplistic and the level design bland and seemingly unfinished, and &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; thought that, without enemies, &quot;this is just not half the game it could have been&quot;. &quot;Game Players&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s lack of replay value, saying the game&#x27;s simplicity made secrets in levels impossible to miss. However, &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;GameFan&quot;, and &quot;EGM&quot; praised the number of playable characters, and &quot;IGN&quot; felt the game&#x27;s &quot;marvelous&quot; fully 3D special stages were the best of the &quot;Sonic&quot; series.

&quot;IGN&quot; described &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; as &quot;a bad game with a good foundation&quot;, and in another article, concluded that it was interesting, if flawed. &quot;EGM&quot; felt it was the best for the 32X but failed to live up to previous games in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. &quot;Game Players&quot; found it a major disappointment, saying &quot;other than a few color-enhanced backgrounds, you&#x27;re gonna wonder why this isn&#x27;t a Genesis title&quot;. Some journalists have referred to &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; as the series&#x27; declining point, and &quot;AllGame&quot; and &quot;Complex&quot; both wrote that it was among the worst games in the series.

==Legacy==
&quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; is considered the last of the &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Sonic&quot; games before the 3D game &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998) took the series in new gameplay directions. Several of its concepts were re-used in later &quot;Sonic&quot; games. A similar partner system features in the Game Boy Advance game &quot;Sonic Advance 3&quot; (2004), and &quot;IGN&quot; noted similarities between the game&#x27;s auto-running special stages and &quot;Sonic and the Secret Rings&quot; (2007). Two tracks from &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;, &quot;Tube Panic&quot; and &quot;Door Into Summer&quot;, appear in &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; (2011). The &quot;Hyper Ring&quot; power-up re-appeared in &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; (2017) and a recreation of &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;″s final boss fight was added in a 2018 update.

With the exception of Mighty, all Chaotix members have become recurring characters in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. The characters initially did not reappear until &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; in 2003. Director Takashi Iizuka said that Sonic Team revived the Chaotix because the studio thought they were unique and had never used them. Iizuka considers the &quot;Heroes&quot; version of the characters different from the 32X one, claiming to have created new characters simply using the same designs. The group had storylines in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic series produced by Archie Comics and &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; by Fleetway Publications, as well as in the anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot;. While &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered the Chaotix to be among the best characters of the franchise and are underutilized, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; considered the introduction of the Chaotix a negative turning point for the series as it &quot;diluted the &quot;Sonic&quot;-verse by introducing tons of shitty characters&quot;. James Stephanie Sterling felt that all the Chaotix lacked redeeming qualities, calling Vector &quot;Idiot the Crocodile&quot; and Espio &quot;Generic Brooder the Chameleon&quot;. They singled out Charmy for particular ridicule, feeling he was annoying and noting his high-pitched voice. Mighty would eventually return as a playable character in &quot;Sonic Mania Plus&quot; in 2018.

In 2011, Sega noted fans frequently requested &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; as a game desired to be rereleased. &quot;1UP.com&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot; expressed disappointment the 2005 compilation &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; did not include the game. In 2010, Sonic Team head Iizuka expressed interest in developing a sequel. Also expressing interest was Christian Whitehead, the developer of the mobile versions of &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, saying in 2014 that he would be open to remaking &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; using the Retro Engine.

<doc id="440995" wikidata="Q221552" url="?curid=440995" title="Ambigram">
<text>An ambigram is a calligraphic composition of glyphs (letters, numbers, symbols or other shapes) that can yield different meanings depending on the orientation of observation. Most ambigrams are visual palindromes that rely on some kind of symmetry, and they can often be interpreted as visual puns. The term was coined by Douglas Hofstadter in 1983–1984.

Most often, ambigrams appear as visually symmetrical words. When flipped, they remain unchanged, or they mutate to reveal another meaning. &quot;Half-turn&quot; ambigrams undergo a point reflection (180-degree rotational symmetry) and can be read upside down (for example, the word &quot;swims&quot;), while mirror ambigrams have axial symmetry and can be read through a reflective surface like a mirror. Many other types of ambigrams exist.

Ambigrams can be constructed in various languages and alphabets, and the notion often extends to numbers and other symbols. It is a recent interdisciplinary concept, combining art, literature, mathematics, cognition, and optical illusions. Drawing symmetrical words constitutes also a recreational activity for amateurs. Numerous ambigram logos are famous, and ambigram tattoos have become increasingly popular. There are methods to design an ambigram, a field in which some artists have become specialists.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;ambigram&quot; was coined in 1983 by Douglas Hofstadter, an American scholar of cognitive science best known as the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;.
It is a neologism composed of the Latin prefix (&quot;both&quot;) and the Greek suffix (&quot;drawing, writing&quot;).

Hofstadter describes ambigrams as &quot;calligraphic designs that manage to squeeze in two different readings.&quot; &quot;The essence is imbuing a single written form with ambiguity&quot;.

Hofstadter attributes the origin of the word &quot;ambigram&quot; to conversations among a small group of friends in 1983.

Prior to Hofstadter&#x27;s terminology, other names were used to refer to ambigrams. Among them, the expressions &quot;vertical palindromes&quot; by Dmitri Borgmann (1965) and Georges Perec, &quot;designatures&quot; (1979), &quot;inversions&quot; (1980) by Scott Kim, or simply &quot;upside-down words&quot; by John Langdon and Robert Petrick.

&quot;Ambigram&quot; was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in March 2011, and to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in September 2020. Scrabble included the word in its database in November 2022.

Many ambigrams can be described as graphic palindromes.

The first Sator square palindrome was found in the ruins of Pompeii, meaning it was created before the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
A sator square using the mirror writing for the representation of the letters S and N was carved in a stone wall in Oppède (France) between the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages, thus producing a work made up of 25 letters and 8 different characters, 3 naturally symmetrical (A, T, O), 3 others decipherable from left to right (R, P, E), and 2 others from right to left (S, N). This engraving is therefore readable in four directions.

Although the term is recent, the existence of mirror ambigrams has been attested since at least the first millennium. They are generally palindromes stylized to be visually symmetrical.

In ancient Greek, the phrase (&quot;wash the sins, not only the face&quot;), is a palindrome found in several locations, including the site of the church Hagia Sophia in Turkey. It is sometimes turned into a mirror ambigram when written in capital letters with the removal of spaces, and the stylization of the letter Ν (Ν).

A boustrophedon is a type of bi-directional text, mostly seen in ancient manuscripts and other inscriptions. Every other line of writing is flipped or reversed, with reversed letters. Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in Arabic and Hebrew, alternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. This two-way writing system reveals that modern ambigrams can have quite ancient origins, with an intuitive component in some minds.

Mirror writing in Islamic calligraphy flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the Hejaz.

The earliest known non-natural rotational ambigram dates to 1893 by artist Peter Newell. Although better known for his children&#x27;s books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of reversible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped upside down. The last page in his book &quot;Topsys &amp; Turvys&quot; contains the phrase &quot;The end&quot;, which, when inverted, reads &quot;Puzzle&quot;. In &quot;Topsys &amp; Turvys Number 2&quot; (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which &quot;The end&quot; changes into &quot;Puzzle 2&quot;.

In March 1904 the Dutch-American comic artist Gustave Verbeek used ambigrams in three consecutive strips of &quot;The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins&quot;. His comics were ambiguous images, made in such a way that one could read the six-panel comic, flip the book and keep reading.

From June to September 1908, the British monthly &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; published a series of ambigrams by different people in its &quot;Curiosities&quot; column. Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words. Mitchell T. Lavin, whose &quot;chump&quot; was published in June, wrote, &quot;I think it is in the only word in the English language which has this peculiarity,&quot; while Clarence Williams wrote, about his &quot;Bet&quot; ambigram, &quot;Possibly B is the only letter of the alphabet that will produce such an interesting anomaly.&quot;

==Characteristics==

===Natural ambigrams===



In the Latin alphabet, many letters are symmetrical glyphs. The capital letters B, C, D, E, H, I, K, O, and X have a horizontal symmetry axis. This means that all words that can be written using only these letters are natural lake reflection ambigrams; examples include BOOK, CHOICE, or DECIDE.

The lowercase letters o, s, x, and z are rotationally symmetric, while pairs such as b/q, d/p, n/u, and in some typefaces a/e, h/y and m/w, are rotations of each other. Among the lowercase letters &quot;l&quot; is unique since its symmetry is broken if it is close to a reference character which establishes a clear x-height. When rotated around the middle of the x-height l/ȷ or lo/oȷ it doesn&#x27;t appear the same, but it does when rotated around its center like the uppercase-I. Thus, the words &quot;sos&quot;, &quot;pod&quot;, &quot;suns&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot;, &quot;swims&quot;, &quot;passed&quot;, or &quot;dollop&quot;, form natural rotational ambigrams.

More generally, a &quot;natural ambigram&quot; is a word that possesses one or more symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling. The words &quot;bud&quot;, &quot;bid&quot;, or &quot;mom&quot;, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a vertical axis, as does &quot;&quot;, the name of the country Libya in Arabic. The words &quot;HIM&quot;, &quot;TOY, &quot;TOOTH&quot; or &quot;MAXIMUM&quot;, in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when their letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis. The uppercase word &quot;OHIO&quot; can flip a quarter to produce a 90° rotational ambigram when written in serif style (with large &quot;feet&quot; above and below the &quot;I&quot;).

Like all strobogrammatic numbers, 69 is a natural rotational ambigram.

Patterns in nature are regularities found in the natural world. Similarly, patterns in ambigrams are regularities found in graphemes.
As a consequence to this &quot;natural&quot; property, some shapes appear more or less appropriate to handle for the designer. Ambigram candidates can become &quot;&quot;almost&quot; natural&quot;, when all the letters except maybe one or two are symmetrically cooperative, for example the word &quot;awesome&quot; possesses 5 compatible letters (the central s that flips around itself, and the couples a/e and w/m).

===Single word or several words===
A symmetrical ambigram can be called &quot;homogram&quot; (contraction of &quot;homo-ambigram&quot;) when it remains unchanged after reflection, and &quot;heterogram&quot; when it transforms. In the most common type of ambigram, the two interpretations arise when the image is rotated 180 degrees with respect to each other (in other words, a second reading is obtained from the first by simply rotating the sheet).

====Single====

Douglas Hofstadter coined the word &quot;homogram&quot; to define an ambigram with identical letters. In this case, the first half of the word turns into the last half.

====Several====

A symmetrical ambigram may be called a &quot;heterogram&quot; (contraction of &quot;hetero-ambigram&quot;) when it becomes a different word after rotation. Visually, a hetero-ambigram is symmetrical only when both versions of the pairing are shown together. The aesthetic appearance is more difficult to design when a changing ambigram is intended to be shown in one way only, because symmetry generally enhances the visual appearance of artwork. Technically, there are two times more combinations of letters involved in a &quot;hetero-ambigram&quot; than in a &quot;homo-ambigram&quot;. For example, the 180° rotational ambigram &quot;yeah&quot; contains only two pairs of letters: y/h and e/a, whereas the heterogram &quot;yeah / good&quot; contains four : y/d, e/o, a/o, and h/g.

There is no limitation to the number of words that can potentially be paired up as hetero-ambigrams, and full ambigram sentences have even been published.

==Types==

Ambigrams are exercises in graphic design that play with optical illusions, symmetry and visual perception.
Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their form and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories.

===180° rotational===

&quot;Half-turn&quot; ambigrams or &quot;point reflection&quot; ambigrams, commonly called &quot;upside-down words&quot;, are 180° rotational symmetrical calligraphies. They can be read right side up or upside down, or both.

===Reflection===

A mirror or reflection ambigram is a design that can be read when reflected in a mirror vertically, horizontally, or at 45 degrees, giving either the same word or another word or phrase.

====Vertical axis====



When the reflecting surface is vertical (like a mirror for example), the calligraphic design is a &quot;vertical axis mirror ambigram&quot;.

The &quot;museum&quot; ambigram is almost natural with mirror symmetry, because the first two letters are easily exchanged with the last two, and the lowercase letter e can be transformed into s by a fairly obvious typographical acrobatics.

Vertical axis mirror ambigrams find clever applications in mirror writing (or specular writing), that is formed by writing in the direction that is the reverse of the natural way for a given language, such that the result is the mirror image of normal writing: it appears normal when it is reflected in a mirror. For example, the word &quot;ambulance&quot; could be read frontward and backward in a vertical axis reflective ambigram. Following this idea, the French artist Patrice Hamel created a mirror ambigram saying &quot;entrée&quot; (&quot;entrance&quot;, in French) one way, and &quot;sortie&quot; (&quot;exit&quot;) the other way, displayed in the giant glass façade of the Gare du Nord in Paris, so that the travelers coming in read &quot;entrance&quot;, and those leaving read &quot;way out&quot;.
====Horizontal axis====

When the reflecting surface is horizontal (like a mirroring lake for example), the calligraphic design is a &quot;horizontal axis mirror ambigram&quot;.

The book &quot;Ambigrams Revealed&quot; features several creations of this type, like the word &quot;Failure&quot; mirroring in the water of a pond to give &quot;Success&quot;, or &quot;Love&quot; changing into &quot;Lust&quot;.

===Figure-ground===

In a figure / ground ambigram, letters fit together so the negative space around and between one word spells another word.

In Gestalt psychology, figure–ground perception is known as identifying a &quot;figure&quot; from the back&quot;ground&quot;. For example, black words on a printed paper are seen as the &quot;figure&quot;, and the white sheet as the &quot;background&quot;.
In ambigrams, the typographic space of the background is used as negative space to form new letters and new words. For example, inside a capital H, one can easily insert a lowercase i.

The oil painting &quot;You &amp; Me&quot; (US) by John Langdon (1996) belongs to this category. The word &quot;me&quot; fills the space between the letters of &quot;you&quot;.

===Tessellations===

With Escher-like tessellations associated to word patterns, ambigrams can be oriented in three, four, and up to six directions via rotational symmetries of 120°, 90° and 60° respectively, such as those created by French artist Alain Nicolas. Some words can also transform in the negative space, but the multiplication of constraints often has the effect of reducing either the readability or the complexity of the designed words.

Ambigram tessellations are word puzzles, in which geometry sets the rules.


===Chain===


A chain ambigram is a design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain.
Letters are usually overlapped: a word will start partway through another word.
Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle.
For example, the chain &quot;...sunsunsunsun...&quot; can flip upside down, but not the word &quot;sun&quot; alone, written horizontally.
A chain ambigram can be constituted of one to several elements. A single element ambigram chain is like a snake eating its own tail. A two-elements ambigram chain is like a snake eating the neighbor&#x27;s tail with the neighbor eating the first snake&#x27;s, and so on.

Scott Kim&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Infinity&quot; works, and that of John Langdon &quot;Chain reaction&quot;&quot;, are also self-referential, since the first is infinite in the literal sense of the word, and the second, both reversible at 180° and interfering around the letter O, evokes a chain reaction.

===Spinonyms===

A is a type of ambigram in which a word is written using the same glyph repeated in different orientations.
WEB is an example of a word that can easily be made into a spinonym.

===Perceptual shift===

Perceptual shift ambigrams, also called &quot;oscillation&quot; ambigrams, are designs with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted. These ambigrams work on the principle of rabbit-duck-style ambiguous images.

For example Douglas Hofstadter expresses the dual nature of light as revealed by physics with his perceptual shift ambigram &quot;Wave / Particle&quot;.

===90° rotational===

&quot;Quarter-turn&quot; ambigrams or 90° rotational ambigrams turn clockwise or counterclockwise to express different meanings. For example, the letter U can turn into a C and reciprocally, or the letters M or W into an E.

===Totem===

A totem ambigram is an ambigram whose letters are stacked like a totem, most often offering a vertical axis mirror symmetry.
This type helps when several letters fit together, but hardly the whole word.
For example, in the , the letters M, A and I are individually symmetrical, and the pairing R/A is almost naturally mirroring.
When adequately stacked, the 5 letters produce a nice totem ambigram, whereas the whole name &quot;Maria&quot; would not offer the same cooperativeness.

The ambigrammist artist John Langdon designed several totemic assemblages, such as the word &quot;METRO&quot; composed of the symmetrical letter M, then section ETR, and below O; or the sentence &quot;THANK YOU&quot;, vertical assembly of T, H, A, then of the symmetric NK couple, then finally Y, O, U.

===Fractal===

In mathematics, a fractal is a geometrical shape that exhibits invariance under scaling.
A piece of the whole, if enlarged, has the same geometrical features as the entire object itself.
A fractal ambigram is a sort of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a self-similar manner, forming a fractal.
In general, only a few letters are constrained in a fractal ambigram. The other letters don&#x27;t need to look like any other, and thus can be shaped freely.

===3-dimensional===

A 3D ambigram is a design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles.
Such designs can be generated using constructive solid geometry, a technique used in solid modeling, and then physically constructed with the rapid prototyping method.

3-dimensional ambigram sculptures can also be achieved in plastic arts. They are volume ambigrams.

The original 1979 edition of Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; featured two 3-D ambigrams on the cover.

===Complex===

Complex ambigrams are ambigrams involving more than one symmetry, or satisfying the criteria for several types. For example, a complex ambigram can be both rotational and mirror with a 4-fold dihedral symmetry. Or a spinonym that reads upside down is also a complex ambigram.

==Symbols==

===Languages===

Ambigrams exist in many languages. With the Latin alphabet, they generally mix lowercase and uppercase letters. But words can also be symmetrical in other alphabets, like Arabic, Bengali, Cyrillic, Greek, and even in Chinese characters and Japanese kanji.

In Korean, (bear) and (door), (ball) and (luck), or (water) and (ROM) form a natural rotational ambigram. Some syllables like (yes), (ticket/signage) or (&quot;object particle&quot;), and words like &quot;허리피라우&quot; (straighten your back) also make full ambigrams.

The han character meaning &quot;hundred&quot; is written , that makes a natural 90° rotational ambigram when the glyph makes a quarter turn counterclockwise, one sees &quot;100&quot;.

===Numbers===

An ambigram of numbers, or &quot;numeral ambigram&quot;, contains numerical digits, like 1, 2, 3...

In mathematics, a palindromic number (also known as a &quot;numeral palindrome&quot;) is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed through a vertical axis (but not necessarily visually). The palindromic numbers containing only 1, 8, and 0, constitute natural numeric ambigrams (visually symmetrical through a mirror). Also, because the glyph 2 is graphically the mirror image of 5, it means numbers like 205 or 85128 are natural numeral mirror ambigrams. Though not palindromic in the mathematical sense, they read frontward and backward like real ambigrams.

A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. The numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).

Some dates are natural numeral ambigrams.
In March 1961, artist Norman Mingo created an upside-down cover for &quot;Mad magazine&quot; featuring an ambigram of the current year. The title says &quot;No matter how you look at it... it&#x27;s gonna be a &quot;Mad&quot; year. 1961, the first upside-down year since 1881.&quot;
Tuesday, 22 February 2022, was a palindrome and ambigram date called &quot;Twosday&quot; because it contained reversible 2 (two).

Ambigrams of numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics.

Ambigrams with numbers sometimes combine letters and numerical digits. Because the number 5 is approximately shaped like the letter S, the number 6 like a lowercase b, the number 9 like the letter g, it is possible to play on these similarities to design ambigrams. A good example is the Sochi 2014 (Olympic games) logo where the four glyphs contained in 2014 are exact symmetries of the four letters S, o, i and h, individually.

===Others===
As alphabet letters are glyphs used in the writing systems to express the languages visually, other symbols are also used in the world to code other fields, like the prosigns in the Morse code or the musical notes in music.

Similarly to the ambigrams of letters, the ambigrams with other symbols are generally visually symmetrical, either point reflective or reflective through an axis.

The international Morse code distress signal SOS is a natural ambigram constituted of dots and dashes. It flips upside down or through a mirror.

In morse code, the letter P coded and the letter R coded are individually symmetrical, like many other letters and numbers. Also, the letter G coded is the exact reverse of the letter W coded . Thus, the combination / coding the pairing G/W constitutes a natural ambigram. Consequently, meaningful natural ambigrams written in morse code certainly exist, like for example the words &quot;wog&quot; , &quot;Dou&quot; or &quot;mom&quot; .

In music, the interlude from Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Lulu&quot; is a palindrome, thus the score made up of musical notes is almost symmetrical through a vertical axis.

In biology, researchers study the ambigrammatic property of narnaviruses by using visual representations of the symmetrical sequences.

==Fields==

===Art===

====Calligraphy and typography====

Instead of simply writing them, ambigram lettering covers the art of drawing letters. In ambigram calligraphy, each letter acts as an illustration, each letter is created with attention to detail and has a unique role within a composition. Lettering ambigrams do not translate into combinations of alphabet letters that can be used like a typeface, since they are created with a specific candidate in mind.

The calligrapher, graffiti writer and graphic designer Niels Shoe Meulman created several rotational ambigrams like the number &quot;fifty&quot;, the names &quot;Shoe / Patta&quot;, and the opposition &quot;Love / Fear&quot;.

The cover of the 7th volume of the typography book &quot;Typism&quot; is an ambigram drawn by Nikita Prokhorov.

The American type designer Mark Simonson designed poetic and humorous ambigrams, such as the words &quot;Revelation&quot;, &quot;Typophile&quot;, and the symbiosis &quot;Drink / Drunk&quot;. The last one makes a visual pun when printed on a shot glass, sold commercially.

====Logos====



Since they are visually striking, and sometimes surprising, ambigram words find large application in corporate logos and wordmarks, setting the visual identity of many organizations, trademarks and brands.

In 1968 or 1969, Raymond Loewy designed the rotational ambigram logo.

The mirror ambigram DeLorean Motor Company logo, designed by Phil Gibbon, was first used in 1975.

Robert Petrick designed the invertible &quot;Angel&quot; logo in 1976.

The logo Sun (Microsystems) designed by professor Vaughan Pratt in 1982 fulfills the criteria of several types: chain ambigram, spinonym, 90° and 180° rotational symmetries.

The Swedish pop group ABBA owns a mirror ambigram logo stylized AᗺBA with a reversed B, designed by in 1976.

The Ventura logo of the Visitors &amp; Convention Bureau&#x27;s board, in California, cost and was created in 2014 by the DuPuis group. It uses a 180° rotational symmetry.

Other famous ambigram logos include: 
the insurance company Aviva;
the acronym CRD (Capital Regional District) in the Canadian province of British Columbia;
the American multinational corporation DXC Technology;
the two-sided marketplace for residential cleaning Handy;
the brand name of French premium high-speed train services InOui;
the French company specializing in ticketing and passenger information systems IXXI;
the century-old brand Maoam of the confectionery manufacturer Haribo;
the American industrial rock band NIͶ;
the Japanese food company Nissin;
the biotechnology company Noxxon Pharma, founded in 1997;
the online travel agency Opodo in 2001;
the brand of food products OXO born in 1899;
the video game Pod;
the American developer and manufacturer of audio products Sonos;
the American professional basketball team Phoenix Suns;
the German manufacturer of adhesive products UHU;
the quadruple symmetrical logo UA from the American clothing brand &quot; Under Armour &quot;;
the Canadian corporation mandated to operate intercity passenger rail service VIA in 1978;
the American international broadcaster VOA, born in 1942;
and the Malaysian mobile virtual network operator XOX. The student edition of the Tesco Clubcard used 180° rotational symmetry.

====Visual communication====

Because they are visual puns, ambigrams generally attract attention, and thus can be used in visual communication to broadcast a marketing or political message.

In France, a mirror ambigram &quot;Penelope / benevole&quot; legible through a horizontal axis became a meme on the web after its diffusion on Wikimedia Commons.
Penelope Fillon, wife of French politician and former Prime Minister of France François Fillon, is suspected of having received wages for a fictitious job. Ironically, her name through the mirror becomes benevole (&quot;voluntary&quot; in French), suggesting dedication for a free service. Shared tens of thousands of times on the social networks, this humorous ambigram made the buzz via several French, Belgian and Swiss medias.

Ambigrams are regularly used by communication agencies such as Publicis to engage the reader or the consumer through two-way messages.
Thus, in 2021, male first names transformed into female first names are included in a Swiss advertising campaign aimed at raising awareness about gender equality. An intriguing catchphrase typography upside down invites the reader to rotate the magazine, in which the first names &quot;Michael&quot; or &quot;Peter&quot; are transformed into &quot;Nathalie&quot; or &quot;Alice&quot;.

In 2015 iSmart&#x27;s logo on one of its travel chargers went viral because the brand&#x27;s name turned out to be a natural ambigram that read &quot;+Jews!&quot; upside down. The company noted that &quot;...we learned a powerful lesson of what not to do when creating a logo.&quot;
&lt;ref name=&quot;iSmart/Jews!&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinema posters sometimes seduce observers with ambigram titles, such as that of Tenet by Christopher Nolan, by central symmetry.
or Anna by Luc Besson around a vertical axis,

====Comics====

The American artist and writer Peter Newell published a rotational ambigram in 1893 saying &quot;Puzzle / The end&quot; in the book containing reversible illustrations &quot;Topsys &amp; Turvys&quot;.

In March 1904 the Dutch-American comic artist Gustave Verbeek used ambigrams in three consecutive strips of &quot;The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins&quot;. His comics were ambiguous images, made in such a way that one could read the six-panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. In &quot;The Wonderful Cure of the Waterfall&quot; (13 March 1904) an Indian medicine man says &#x27;Big waters would make her very sound&#x27;, while when flipped the medicine man turns into an Indian woman who says &#x27;punos dery, ery apew poom, serlem big&#x27;. Which is explained as, &#x27;poor deary&#x27; several foreign words that meant that she would call the &#x27;Serlem Big&#x27;. The next comic called &quot;At the House of the Writing Pig&quot; (20 March 1904), where two ambigram word balloons are featured. The first features an angry pig trying to make the main protagonist leave by showing a sign that says; &#x27;big boy go away, dis am home of mr h hog&#x27;, up side down it reads &#x27;Boy yew go away. We sip. Home of hog pig.&#x27; The protagonist asks the pig if it wants a big bun, upon which it replies &#x27;Why big buns? Am mad u!&#x27;, which flips into &#x27;In pew we sang big hym&#x27;. Finally in &quot;The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard&quot; (1904 Mar 27) there are two more ambigrams. The first turns &#x27;How do you do&#x27; into the name of a wizard called &#x27;Opnohop Moy&#x27;, the second features a squirrel telling the protagonist &#x27;Yes further on&#x27; only to inform it that there are &#x27;No serpents here&#x27; on his way back. In a 2012 Swedish remake of the book, the artist Marcus Ivarsson redraws &quot;The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard&quot; in his own style. He removes the squirrel, but keeps the other ambigram. &#x27;How do you do&#x27; is replaced by &#x27;Nejnej&#x27; (Swedish for no) and the wizard is now called &#x27;Laulau&#x27;.

Oubapo, &quot;workshop of potential comic book art&quot;, is a comics movement which believes in the use of formal constraints to push the boundaries of the medium. Étienne Lécroart, cartoonist, is a founder and key member of Oubapo association, and has composed cartoons that could be read either horizontally, vertically, or in diagonal, and vice versa, sometimes including appropriate ambigrams.

====Drawings and paintings====

The British painter, designer and illustrator Rex Whistler, published in 1946 a rotational ambigram &quot;¡OHO!&quot; for the cover of a book gathering reversible drawings.

The artist John Langdon, specialist of ambigrams, designed many color paintings featuring ambigrams of all kinds, figure-ground, rotational, mirror or totem. Among other influences, he particularly admires M. C. Escher&#x27;s drawings.

The Canadian artist Kelly Klages painted several acrylics on canvas with ambigram words and sentences referring to famous writers&#x27; novels written by William Shakespeare or Agatha Christie, such as &quot;Third Girl&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;After the Funeral&quot;, &quot;The Hollow&quot;, Reformation, Sherlock Holmes, and &quot;Elephants Can Remember&quot;.

====Sculptures====

The German conceptual artist Mia Florentine Weiss built a sculptural ambigram , that has traveled Europe as a symbol of peace and change of perspective. Depending on which side the viewer looks at it, the sculpture says &quot;Love&quot; or &quot;Hate&quot;. A similar concept was installed in front of the Reichstag building in Berlin with the words &quot;Now / Won&quot;. Both sculptures are mirror type ambigrams, symmetrical around a vertical axis.

The Swiss sculptor Markus Raetz made several three-dimensional ambigram works, featuring words generally with related meanings, such as
YES-NO (2003),
ME-WE (2004, 2010),
OUI-NON (2000–2002) in French,
SI–NO (1996)
and TODO-NADA (1998) in Spanish
These are anamorphic works, which change in appearance depending on the angle of view of the observer.
The OUI–NON ambigram is installed on the Place du Rhône, in Geneva, Switzerland, at the top of a metal pole. Physically, the letters have the appearance of iron twists. With the perspective, this work demonstrates that reality can be ambiguous.

Some ambigram sculptures by the French conjurer are reversible by a half-turn rotation, and can therefore be exhibited on a support in two different ways.

====Tattoos====

One of the most dynamic sectors that harbors ambigrams is tattooing. Because they possess two ways of reading, ambigram tattoos inked on the skin benefit from a &quot;mind-blowing&quot; effect. On the arm, sleeve tattoos flip upside-down, on the back or jointly on two wrists they are more striking with a mirror symmetry. A large range of scripts and fonts is available. Experienced ambigram artists can create an optical illusion with a complex visual design.

In 2015, an ambigram tattoo went viral following an advertising campaign developed by the Publicis group two years earlier. The &quot;Samaritans of Singapore&quot; organization, active in suicide prevention, has a 180° reversible &quot;SOS&quot; ambigram logo, acronym of its name and homonym of the famous SOS distress signal.
In 2013, this center orders advertisements that could be inserted in magazines to make readers aware of the problem of depression among young people, and the communication agency notices the symmetrical aspect of the logo. As a result, it begins to produce several ambigrammatic visuals, staged in photographic contexts, where sentences such as &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot;, &quot;I feel fantastic&quot; or &quot;Life is great&quot; turn into &quot;Save me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m falling apart&quot;, and &quot;I hate myself&quot;. Readers noticing this logo placed at the upper left corner of the page with an upside-down typographical catchphrase rotate the newspaper and visualize the double calligraphed messages, which call out with the &quot;SOS&quot;.
These ads are so influential that Bekah Miles, an American student herself coming out of a severe depression, chooses to use the &quot;I&#x27;m fine / Save me&quot; ambigram to get a tattoo on her thigh. Posted on Facebook, the two-sided photography immediately appeals to many young people, impressed or sensitive to this difficulty.
To educate its students, George Fox University in the United States then relays the optical illusion in its official journal, through a video totaling more than three million views and the information is also reproduced in several local media and international organizations, thus helping to popularize this famous two-way tattoo.
Less fortunate, another teenage girl, aged 16, committed suicide, with her also this ambigram found on a note in her room, &quot;I&#x27;m fine / Save me&quot;, reversible calligraphy today printed on badges and bracelets, for educational purposes.

===Literature===

====Palindromes====

Ambigrams are sorts of visual palindromes. Some words turn upside down, others are symmetrical through a mirror. Natural ambigram palindromes exist, like the words &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;malayalam&quot; (Dravidian language), or the biotechnology company Noxxon that possesses a palindromic name associated to a rotational ambigram logo. But some words are natural ambigrams, though not palindromes in the literary acception, like &quot;bud&quot; for example, because b and d are different letters. As a result, some words and sentences are good candidates for ambigrammists, but not for palindromists, and reciprocally, since the constraints differ slightly. Authors of ambigrams also benefit from a certain flexibility by playing on the typeface and graphical adjustments to influence the reading of their visual palindromes.

Oulipo, &quot;workshop of potential literature&quot;, seeks to create works using constrained writing techniques. Georges Perec, French novelist and member of the Oulipo group, designed a rotational ambigram, that he called &quot;vertical palindrome&quot;. Sibylline, the sentence &quot;Andin Basnoda a une épouse qui pue&quot; in French means &quot;Andin Basnoda has a smelly wife&quot;. Perec did not care about punctuation spaces, but his creation flips easily with a classical font like Arial.

Visual palindromes sometimes perfectly illustrate literary contents. The American author Dan Brown incorporated John Langdon&#x27;s designs into the plot of his bestseller &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, and his fictional character Robert Langdon&#x27;s surname was a homage to the ambigram artist.

The fantasy novel Abarat, written and illustrated by Clive Barker, features an ambigram of the title on its cover.

====Calligrams====

A calligram is text arranged in such a way that it forms a thematically related image. It can be a poem, a phrase, a portion of scripture, or a single word. The visual arrangement can rely on certain use of the typeface, calligraphy or handwriting. The image created by the words illustrates the text by expressing visually what it says, or something closely associated.

In Islamic calligraphy, symmetrical calligrams appear in ancient and modern periods, forming mirror ambigrams in Arabic language.

The word &quot;OK&quot; turned 90° counterclockwise evokes a human icon, with the letter O forming the head and the letter K the arms and the legs. The Norwegian Climbing Club (acronym &quot;OK&quot;) borrowed the concept of this natural calligram for their official logo.

====Semantics====

As described by Douglas Hofstadter, ambigrams are visual puns having two or more (clear) interpretations as written words.

Multilingual ambigrams can be read one way in a language, and another way in a different language or alphabet.
Multi-lingual ambigrams can occur in all of the various types of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking.

Like certain anagrams with providential meanings such as &quot;Listen / Silent&quot; or &quot;The eyes / They see&quot;, ambigrams also sometimes take on a timely sense, for example &quot;up&quot; becomes the abbreviation &quot;dn&quot;, very naturally by rotation of 180°.
But on the other hand, it happens that the luck of the letters makes things bad. This is the case with the weird anagram &quot;Santa / Satan&quot;, as it is with a rotational ambigram that has gone viral because of the paradoxical and unintentional message it expresses. Spotted in 2015 on a metal medal marketed without bad intention, the text &quot;hope&quot; displays upside down with a fairly obvious reading &quot;Adolf&quot;. This coincidence photographed by an Internet user was relayed by several media and constitutes an ambiguous image.

===Mathematics===

Recreational mathematics is carried out for entertainment rather than as a strictly research and application-based professional activity. An ambigram magic square exists, with the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals the same right side up and upside down (180° rotational design). Numeral ambigrams also associate with alphabet letters. A &quot;dissection&quot; ambigram of &quot;squaring the circle&quot; was achieved in a puzzle where each piece of the word &quot;circle&quot; fits inside a perfect square.

Burkard Polster, professor of mathematics in Melbourne conducted researches on ambigrams and published several books dealing with the topic, including &quot;Eye Twisters, Ambigrams &amp; Other Visual Puzzles to Amaze and Entertain&quot;. In the abstract &quot;Mathemagical Ambigrams&quot;, Polster performs several ambigrams closely related to his realm, like the words &quot;algebra&quot;, &quot;geometry&quot;, &quot;math&quot;, &quot;maths&quot;, or &quot;mathematics&quot;.

Calculator spelling is an unintended characteristic of the seven-segment display traditionally used by calculators, in which, when read upside-down, the digits resemble letters of the Latin alphabet. Also, palindromic numbers and strobogrammatic numbers sometimes attract attention of mathematician ambigrammists.

Ambigram tessellations and 3D ambigrams are two types particularly fun for the mathematician in geometry. Word patterns in tessellations can start from 35 different fundamental polygons, such as the rhombus, the isosceles right triangle, or the parallelogram.

Word puzzles are used as a source of entertainment, but can additionally serve an educational purpose. The American puzzle designer Scott Kim published several ambigrams in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in Martin Gardner&#x27;s
&quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column, among them long sentences like &quot;Martin Gardner&#x27;s celebration of mind&quot; turning into &quot;Physics, patterns and prestidigitation&quot;.

===Psychology===

Legibility is an important aspect in successful ambigrams. It concerns the ease with which a reader decodes symbols. If the message is lost or difficult to perceive, an ambigram does not work. Readability is related to perception, or how our brain interprets the forms we see through our eyes.

Symmetry in ambigrams generally improves the visual appearance of the calligraphic words. Hermann Rorschach, inventor of the Rorschach Test notices that asymmetric figures are rejected by many subjects. Symmetry supplies part of the necessary artistic composition.

For many amateurs, designing ambigrams represents a recreational activity, where serendipity can play a fertile role, when the author makes an unplanned fortunate discovery.

====Duality and analogy====

In the word &quot;ambigram&quot;, the root &quot;ambi-&quot; means &quot;both&quot; and is a popular prefix in a world of dualities, such as day/night, left/right, birth/death, good/evil. In &quot;Wordplay: The Philosophy, Art, and Science of Ambigrams&quot;, John Langdon mentions the yin and yang symbol as one of his major influences to create upside down words.

Ambigrams are mentioned in &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot;, an eclectic collection of articles that Douglas Hofstadter wrote for the popular science magazine &quot;Scientific American&quot; during the early 1980s.

===Magic===

In magic, ambigrams work like visual illusions, revealing an unexpected new message from a particular written word.

In the first series of the British show &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;, the show&#x27;s host and creator Derren Brown uses cards with rotational ambigrams. These cards can read either &#x27;Trick&#x27; or &#x27;Treat&#x27;.

Ambiguous images, of which ambigrams are a part, cause ambiguity in different ways. For example, by rotational symmetry, as in the Illusion of &quot;The Cook&quot; by Giuseppe Arcimboldo (1570); sometimes by a figure-ground ambivalence as in Rubin vase; by perceptual shift as in the rabbit–duck illusion, or through pareidolias; or again, by the representation of impossible objects, such as Necker cube or Penrose triangle. For all these types of images, certain ambigrams exist, and can be combined with visuals of the same type.

John Langdon designed a figure-ground ambigram &quot;optical illusion&quot; with the two words &quot;optical&quot; and &quot;illusion&quot;, one forming the figure and the other the background. &quot;Optical&quot; is easier to see initially but &quot;illusion&quot; emerges with longer observation.

===Manufacturing===

====Clothing and fashion====

Adidas marketed a line of sneakers called &quot;Bounce&quot;, with an ambigram typography printed inside the shoe.

Several clothing brands, such as Helly Hansen (HH), Under Armour (UA), or , raise an ambigram logo as their visual identity.

Mirror ambigrams are also sometimes placed on T-shirts, towels and hats, while socks are more adapted to rotational ambigrams. The conceptual artist Mia Florentine Weiss marketed T-shirts and other products with her mirror ambigram .
Likewise, the city of Ventura in California sells sweatshirts, caps, jackets, and other fashion accessories printed with its rotational ambigram logo.

====Accessories====

The CD cover of the thirteenth studio album &quot;Funeral&quot; by American rapper Lil Wayne features a 180° rotational ambigram reading &quot;Funeral / Lil Wayne&quot;.

The special edition paper sleeve (CD with DVD) of the solo album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard by Paul McCartney features an ambigram of the singer&#x27;s name.

The Grateful Dead have used ambigrams several times, including on their albums &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

Although the words spelled by most ambigrams are relatively short in length, one DVD cover for &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; movie creates a rotational ambigram out of two words &quot;Princess Bride&quot;, whether viewed right side up or upside down.
The cover of the studio album &quot;Create/Destroy/Create&quot; by rock band Goodnight, Sunrise is an ambigram composition constituted of two invariant words, &quot;create&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot;, designed by Polish artist Daniel Dostal.

The reversible shot glass containing a changing message &quot;Drink / Drunk&quot;, created by the typographer Mark Simonson was manufactured and sold in the market.

The concept of reversible sign that some merchants use through their windows to indicate that the store is sometimes &quot;open&quot;, sometimes &quot;closed&quot;, was inaugurated at the beginning of the 2000s, by a rotational ambigram &quot;Open / Closed&quot; developed by David Holst.

==Creation==
Different ambigram artists, sometimes called &quot;ambigrammists&quot;, may create distinctive ambigrams from the same words, differing in both style and form.

===Handmade designs===

There are no universal guidelines for creating ambigrams, and different ways of approaching problems coexist.
A number of books suggest methods for creation, including &quot;WordPlay&quot;, &quot;Eye Twisters&quot;, and &quot;Ambigrams Revealed&quot;, in English.

===Generators===

Computerized methods to automatically create ambigrams have been developed.

===Artists===

John Langdon and Scott Kim each believed that they had invented ambigrams in the 1970s.

====Douglas Hofstadter====

Douglas Hofstadter coined the term.

To explain visually the numerous types of possible ambigrams, Hofstadter created many pieces with different constraints and symmetries. Hofstadter has had several exhibitions of his artwork in various university galleries.

According to Scott Kim, Hofstadter once created a series of 50 ambigrams on the name of all the states in the US.

In 1987 a book of 200 of his ambigrams, together with a long dialogue with his alter ego Egbert G. Gebstadter on ambigrams and creativity, was published in Italy.

====John Langdon====

John Langdon is a self-taught artist, graphic designer and painter, who started designing ambigrams in the late 1960s and early 70s. Lettering specialist, Langdon is a professor of typography and corporate identity at Drexel University in Philadelphia.

John Langdon produced a mirror image logo &quot;Starship&quot; in 1972-1973, that was sold to the rock band Jefferson Starship.

Langdon&#x27;s ambigram book &quot;Wordplay&quot; was published in 1992. It contains about 60 ambigrams. Each design is accompanied by a brief essay that explores the word&#x27;s definition, its etymology, its relationship to philosophy and science, and its use in everyday life.

Ambigrams became more popular as a result of Dan Brown incorporating John Langdon&#x27;s designs into the plot of his bestseller, &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, and the DVD release of the &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; movie contains a bonus chapter called &quot;This is an Ambigram&quot;. Langdon also produced the ambigram that was used for some versions of the book&#x27;s cover. Brown used the name Robert Langdon for the hero in his novels as an homage to John Langdon.

Blacksmith Records, the music management company and record label, possesses a rotational ambigram logo designed by John Langdon.

====Scott Kim====

Scott Kim is one of the best-known masters of the art of ambigrams. He is an American puzzle designer and artist who published in 1981 a book called &quot;Inversions&quot; with ambigrams of many types.

====Other====

Nikita Prokhorov is a graphic designer, lettering artist and ambigram designer. His book &quot;Ambigrams Revealed&quot; showcases ambigram designs of all types, from all around the world.

Born in 1946, Alain Nicolas is a specialist of figurative and ambigram tessellations. In his book, he performed many tilings with various words like &quot;infinity&quot;, &quot;Einstein&quot; or &quot;inversion&quot; legible in many orientations. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Nicolas has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s finest artist of Escher-style tilings&quot;.

<text>Arc welding is a welding process that is used to join metal to metal by using electricity to create enough heat to melt metal, and the melted metals, when cool, result in a joining of the metals. It is a type of welding that uses a welding power supply to create an electric arc between a metal stick (&quot;electrode&quot;) and the base material to melt the metals at the point of contact. Arc welding power supplies can deliver either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current to the work, while consumable or non-consumable electrodes are used.

The welding area is usually protected by some type of shielding gas (e.g. an inert gas), vapor, or slag. Arc welding processes may be manual, semi-automatic, or fully automated. First developed in the late part of the 19th century, arc welding became commercially important in shipbuilding during the Second World War. Today it remains an important process for the fabrication of steel structures and vehicles.

==Power supplies==

To supply the electrical energy necessary for arc welding processes, a number of different power supplies can be used. The most common classification is constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the voltage is directly related to the length of the arc, and the current is related to the amount of heat input. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance. Under normal arc length conditions, a constant current power supply with a stick electrode operates at about 20 volts.

The direction of current used in arc welding also plays an important role in welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In general, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration (around 60%). &quot;Note that for stick welding in general, DC+ polarity is most commonly used. It produces a good bead profile with a higher level of penetration. DC− polarity results in less penetration and a higher electrode melt-off rate. It is sometimes used, for example, on thin sheet metal in an attempt to prevent burn-through.&quot; &quot;With few exceptions, electrode-positive (reversed polarity) results in deeper penetration. Electrode-negative (straight polarity) results in faster melt-off of the electrode and, therefore, faster deposition rate.&quot; Non-consumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current (DC), as well as alternating current (AC). With direct current however, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, eliminating low-voltage time after the zero crossings and minimizing the effects of the problem.

Duty cycle is a welding equipment specification which defines the number of minutes, within a 10-minute period, during which a given arc welder can safely be used. For example, an 80 A welder with a 60% duty cycle must be &quot;rested&quot; for at least 4 minutes after 6 minutes of continuous welding. Failure to observe duty cycle limitations could damage the welder. Commercial- or professional-grade welders typically have a 100% duty cycle.

==Consumable electrode methods==

One of the most common types of arc welding is shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), which is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMAW) or stick welding. An electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and a consumable electrode rod or &quot;stick&quot;. The electrode rod is made of a material that is compatible with the base material being welded and is covered with a flux that gives off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and provide a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary. The process is very versatile, requiring little operator training and inexpensive equipment. However, weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though specialty electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper and other metals. The versatility of the method makes it popular in a number of applications including repair work and construction.

Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), commonly called &quot;MIG&quot; (for &quot;metal/inert-gas&quot;), is a semi-automatic or automatic welding process with a continuously fed consumable wire acting as both electrode and filler metal, along with an inert or semi-inert shielding gas flowed around the wire to protect the weld site from contamination. Constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current alternating current are used as well. With continuously fed filler electrodes, GMAW offers relatively high welding speeds; however the more complicated equipment reduces convenience and versatility in comparison to the SMAW process. Originally developed for welding aluminum and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s, GMAW was soon economically applied to steels. Today, GMAW is commonly used in industries such as the automobile industry for its quality, versatility and speed. Because of the need to maintain a stable shroud of shielding gas around the weld site, it can be problematic to use the GMAW process in areas of high air movement such as outdoors.

Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) is a variation of the GMAW technique. FCAW wire is actually a fine metal tube filled with powdered flux materials. An externally supplied shielding gas is sometimes used, but often the flux itself is relied upon to generate the necessary protection from the atmosphere. The process is widely used in construction because of its high welding speed and portability.

Submerged arc welding (SAW) is a high-productivity welding process in which the arc is struck beneath a covering layer of granular flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself and, combined with the use of a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes since the flux hides the arc and no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products. As the arc is not visible, it is typically automated. SAW is only possible in the 1F (flat fillet), 2F (horizontal fillet), and 1G (flat groove) positions.

==Non-consumable electrode methods==
Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), or &quot;tungsten/inert-gas&quot; (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a non-consumable electrode made of tungsten, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method is characterized by a stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds. It can be used on nearly all weldable metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and marine applications.

A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method can be used on a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium; automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.

Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, carbon arc welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.

==Corrosion issues==
Some materials, notably high-strength steels, aluminum, and titanium alloys, are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. If the electrodes used for welding contain traces of moisture, the water decomposes in the heat of the arc and the liberated hydrogen enters the lattice of the material, causing its brittleness. Stick electrodes for such materials, with special low-hydrogen coating, are delivered in sealed moisture-proof packaging. New electrodes can be used straight from the can, but when moisture absorption may be suspected, they have to be dried by baking (usually at ) in a drying oven. Flux used has to be kept dry as well.

Some austenitic stainless steels and nickel-based alloys are prone to intergranular corrosion. When subjected to temperatures around for too long a time, chromium reacts with carbon in the material, forming chromium carbide and depleting the crystal edges of chromium, impairing their corrosion resistance in a process called sensitization. Such sensitized steel undergoes corrosion in the areas near the welds where the temperature-time was favorable for forming the carbide. This kind of corrosion is often termed weld decay.

Knifeline attack (KLA) is another kind of corrosion affecting welds, impacting steels stabilized by niobium. Niobium and niobium carbide dissolves in steel at very high temperatures. At some cooling regimes, niobium carbide does not precipitate, and the steel then behaves like unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a thin zone several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, making it difficult to spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such steels have to be heated in a whole to about , when the chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after this treatment is not important.

Filler metal (electrode material) improperly chosen for the environmental conditions can make them corrosion-sensitive as well. There are also issues of galvanic corrosion if the electrode composition is sufficiently dissimilar to the materials welded, or the materials are dissimilar themselves. Even between different grades of nickel-based stainless steels, corrosion of welded joints can be severe, despite that they rarely undergo galvanic corrosion when mechanically joined.

==Safety issues==

Welding can be a dangerous and unhealthy practice without the proper precautions; however, with the use of new technology and proper protection the risks of injury or death associated with welding can be greatly reduced.

===Heat, fire, and explosion hazard===
Because many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns from heat and sparks is significant. To prevent them, welders wear protective clothing in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat, flames, and sparks. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes also pose an explosion and fire risk; some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.

===Eye damage===
Exposure to the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding goggles and helmets with dark face plates—much darker than those in sunglasses or oxy-fuel goggles—are worn to prevent this exposure. In recent years, new helmet models have been produced featuring a face plate which automatically self-darkens electronically. To protect bystanders, transparent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.

===Inhaled matter===
Welders are also often exposed to dangerous gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, many processes produce various gases (most commonly carbon dioxide and ozone, but others as well) that can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate.

===Electrical safety===
While the open-circuit voltage of an arc welding machine may be only a few tens of volts up to about 120 volts, even these low voltages can present a hazard of electric shock for the operators. Locations such as ship&#x27;s hulls, storage tanks, metal structural steel, or in wet areas are usually at earth ground potential and operators may be standing or resting on these surfaces during operating of the electric arc. Welding machines operating off AC power distribution systems must isolate the arc circuit from earth ground to prevent insulation faults in the machine from exposing operators to high voltage. The return clamp of the welding machine is located near to the work area, to reduce the risk of stray current traveling a long way to create heating hazards or electric shock exposure, or to cause damage to sensitive electronic devices. Welding operators are careful to install return clamps so that welding current cannot pass through the bearings of electric motors, conveyor rollers, or other rotating components, which would cause damage to bearings. Welding on electrical buswork connected to transformers presents a danger of the low welding voltage being &quot;stepped up&quot; to much higher voltages, so extra grounding cables may be required.

===Interference with pacemakers===
Certain welding machines which use a high frequency alternating current component have been found to affect pacemaker operation when within 2 meters of the power unit and 1 meter of the weld site.

==History==
While examples of forge welding go back to the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, arc welding did not come into practice until much later.

In 1800, Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs. Independently, a Russian physicist named Vasily Petrov discovered the continuous electric arc in 1802 and subsequently proposed its possible practical applications, including welding. Arc welding was first developed when Nikolai Benardos presented arc welding of metals using a carbon electrode at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris in 1881, which was patented together with Stanisław Olszewski in 1887. In the same year, French electrical inventor Auguste de Méritens also invented a carbon arc welding method, patented in 1881, which was successfully used for welding lead in the manufacture of lead–acid batteries. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 19th century by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin. Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released in Britain a coated metal electrode which gave a more stable arc. In 1905, Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed the usage of three-phase electric arc for welding. In 1919, alternating current welding was invented by C. J. Holslag but did not become popular for another decade.

Competing welding processes such as resistance welding and oxyfuel welding were developed during this time as well; but both, especially the latter, faced stiff competition from arc welding especially after metal coverings (known as flux) for the electrode, to stabilize the arc and shield the base material from impurities, continued to be developed.
During World War I, welding started to be used in shipbuilding in Great Britain in place of riveted steel plates. The Americans also became more accepting of the new technology when the process allowed them to repair their ships quickly after a German attack in the New York Harbor at the beginning of the war. Arc welding was first applied to aircraft during the war as well, and some German airplane fuselages were constructed using this process. In 1919, the British shipbuilder Cammell Laird started construction of a merchant ship, the &quot;Fullagar&quot;, with an entirely welded hull; she was launched in 1921.

During the 1920s, major advances were made in welding technology, including the 1920 introduction of automatic welding in which electrode wire was continuously fed. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention as scientists attempted to protect welds from the effects of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals such as aluminum and magnesium. This, in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II.

During the middle of the century, many new welding methods were invented. Submerged arc welding was invented in 1930 and continues to be popular today. In 1932, a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941 and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Using a consumable electrode and a carbon dioxide atmosphere as a shielding gas, it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds. In that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was released in 1958 and was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961.

<text>Susan Vera Cooper OBE (29 October 1902 – 28 July 1995) was a prolific English ceramic designer working in the Stoke-on-Trent pottery industries from the 1920s to the 1980s.

==Life and work==
Born in Burslem, Staffordshire, she was the youngest of seven children. From an early age she developed an interest in drawing, and began her art education by attending night classes at the Burslem School of Art. In 1922 she joined the ceramics firm A. E. Gray &amp; Co. Ltd, partially as a means to gain entry to the Royal College of Art.

A. Edward Gray quickly discovered her talents as a painter and designer, and soon she was producing her hand-painted floral designs. In 1923 A. E. Gray launched the Gloria Lustre Range employing the technique of lustreware. In 1929, motivated by her desire to design ceramic shapes in addition to decors, she broke away with her brother-in-law Albert &quot;Jack&quot; Beeson to set up her own business, as Susie Cooper Potteries.

She worked for many other pottery firms over the next several decades, including Wedgwood. In 1940 she was awarded Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts, and in 1979 she received an OBE. By all accounts Elizabeth, The Queen Mother was an admirer of her work.

At the age of 80 she retired to live on the Isle of Man, and died there in 1995. Like the Potteries-based ceramic designers Clarice Cliff and Charlotte Rhead, her work has become highly sought after and valued by some pottery collectors.

<text>Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra (10 May 1844 – 15 April 1923) was a Nicaraguan-born President of Costa Rica from 1902 to 1906. Esquivel became a naturalized Costa Rican in 1869.

He was also a lawyer and a university professor. After his presidential term, he served as the president of the Supreme Court of Costa Rica from 1917 to 1920.

==President of Costa Rica==
He first ran for the presidency in 1889 but was defeated by José Joaquín Rodríguez. He took up the challenge of running for president in the 1901 elections, which he consequently won. This was his second presidential bid and 1902 saw the start of his only presidency.

His government had to assume a nation with a still weak and little developed economy; however, his government managed to advance the development of the railroad to the Pacific and the establishment of the lyrics of the national anthem.

<text>In Extremo (Latin for &quot;At the Edge&quot;; abbreviated InEx or IE) is a German Medieval metal band originating from Berlin. The band&#x27;s musical style combines metal with medieval traditional songs, blending the sound of the standard rock/metal instruments with historical instruments (such as bagpipes, harp, hurdy-gurdy and shawm). Versions of well-known traditional/medieval ballads make up the main part of their repertoire, but the band has written an increasing share of original material in recent years. Their own material is written in German, whilst the traditional songs and cover songs are in a variety of languages.

==History==

In Extremo began as two projects: a nameless, purely medieval band, and a rock band. They became known at that time through frequent appearances at medieval market meetings, at which they performed their acoustic pieces and sold CDs of their renditions of traditional songs. On 11 April 1995, during the recording for that year&#x27;s season, Michael Rhein (alias &quot;Das letzte Einhorn&quot;, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;) found the project name &quot;In Extremo&quot;.

Most of the band members perform under stage names. The initial members of the medieval band were Das letzte Einhorn (vocals), &quot;Flex der Biegsame&quot; (&quot;Flex the Flexible&quot;; bagpipes), &quot;Dr. Pymonte&quot; (bagpipes), Conny Fuchs (who left the band before the official release date, due to her pregnancy, and was replaced by Dr. Pymonte) and Sen Pusterbalg (replaced shortly after the official release by &quot;Yellow Pfeiffer&quot;, &quot;Yellow Piper&quot;; bagpipes). The band originally consisted of &quot;Thomas der Münzer&quot; (&quot;Thomas the Coiner&quot;; guitar), &quot;Der Morgenstern&quot; (&quot;The Morning Star&quot;; drums) and &quot;Die Lutter&quot; (&quot;The Lutter&quot;, bass guitar). Der Münzer subsequently left the band and, , the band&#x27;s guitarist is &quot;Van Lange&quot;. As noted below, almost all of the band members play multiple instruments.

The increasing number of visitors, success of their CDs and the popular interest, as well as cross-pollination from groups such as Corvus Corax and Bathory, encouraged In Extremo in 1995 to attempt to start a band combining bagpipes and other traditional instruments with rock guitars. The result was the current incarnation of In Extremo, a rock group that integrates modern instruments like the drum set, electric bass and guitar with the acoustic elements previously used for the medieval songs, and which plays both types of music as well as a hybrid of the two.

In August 1996, they began work on the first In Extremo album, which already contained two tracks of the new rock project. Because the album had no official name, it became known as &quot;Gold&quot; because of the golden cover. In February 1997, like the single &quot;Der Galgen&quot; (&quot;The Gallows&quot;), it quickly sold out in medieval markets.

In Extremo played separately as a medieval band and a rock band, until on 29 March 1997, when they played their first live rock concert. Since that time, they have given this date as their date of establishment. The two projects were officially merged on 11 January 1998. April 1998 saw the first &quot;high occupancy&quot; In Extremo concert in the Rabenstein castle in Brandenburg.

Over the years, the band&#x27;s music became more heavy metal-based, while at the same time becoming increasingly commercially successful. The classical instruments, however – bagpipes, shawms and lutes – still play a large role. The band is likewise noted for their conspicuous stage costumes and known for using pyrotechnics in their concerts, including Der Morgenstern playing cymbals which have been set on fire.

In February 2010, In Extremo announced that Der Morgenstern left the band because of musical differences. In June, Florian &quot;Specki T.D.&quot; Speckardt was announced as his replacement on drums. Since then, they have proceeded to release three albums: &quot;Sterneneisen&quot;, &quot;Kunstraub&quot; and &quot;Quid Pro Quo&quot;, all of which have reached the top 10 in the German charts, with &quot;Sterneneisen&quot; and &quot;Quid Pro Quo&quot; both having number 1 positions for a time. Their 13th album, &quot;Kompass zur Sonne&quot;, was scheduled to be released in May 2020, but was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July 2020, the band played an online livestream concert for Wacken World Wide.

===Appearances===

The band&#x27;s first major appearance was in the first part of the 2001 video game &quot;Gothic&quot;. A group of travelling musicians called &#x27;In-Extremo&#x27; plays their version of the song &quot;Herr Mannelig&quot;, from the album &quot;Verehrt und angespien&quot;, by the gallows outside the Old Camp Castle in the second chapter of the game.

With their success, the music programs also began to pay attention to In Extremo. They were invited on the television program &quot;Viva Interactive&quot;, where they gave a 15-minute call-and-response and played two songs. They rejected at that time an invitation to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to play &quot;Küss mich&quot; (&quot;Kiss Me&quot;), because it was, according to Das letzte Einhorn, not their environment. Nevertheless, they did accept a further invitation to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 2005 and played &quot;Nur ihr allein&quot; (&quot;Only You Alone&quot;).

At the same time, their band&#x27;s audience grew with live appearances, from marketplaces to festivals like Rock am Ring, the Taubertal Festival, and the Nova Rock in Austria. Their largest public appearance, however, had In Extremo opening for the farewell tour of Böhse Onkelz in June 2005, with about 120,000 spectators.

In Extremo last participated on 9 February 2006, in the Bundesvision Song Contest of Stefan Raab for the Free State of Thuringia; Das letzte Einhorn was born in Dingelstädt and grew up in Leinefelde. Both cities lie in North Thuringia. The group occupied the third spot with &quot;Liam (German)&quot;. Beforehand, they had introduced themselves on 2 February on the television show &quot;TV total&quot;.

In Extremo also played in 2006 at the Wacken Open Air, as well as on the M&#x27;era Luna Festival in Hildesheim. At the end of the year, they played in the framework their &quot;10 Year Anniversary Tour&quot; in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

===Success===
The first In Extremo album that attracted attention was &quot;Verehrt und angespien&quot; (&quot;Worshipped and Spat At&quot;). It achieved an at-the-time sensational 11th place in the German album charts. The subsequent album, &quot;Sünder ohne Zügel&quot; (&quot;Unbridled Sinners&quot;), reached 10th place.

The band had further success with the album &quot;7&quot;; it came in third place on the German charts. The video of the single &quot;Küss mich&quot; was frequently shown on German music television. The singles reached high chart placements.

The eighth album &quot;Mein rasend Herz&quot; (&quot;My Racing Heart&quot;) achieved third place on the album charts in 2005. Three singles were published from this album: &quot;Nur ihr allein&quot; (&quot;Only You Alone&quot;) on 17 May 2005, &quot;Horizont&quot; (&quot;Horizon&quot;) on 12 September 2005, and &quot;Liam (German)&quot; on 3 February 2006. On 10 February 2006, the second live CD/DVD, &quot;Raue Spree&quot;, was published, coming in at fourth place of the German charts. In addition, the &quot;7&quot; and &quot;Raue Spree&quot; achieved gold status in early 2007.

The ninth album &quot;Sängerkrieg&quot; (&quot;Singers&#x27; War&quot;) went to first place on the album charts of Germany on 23 May 2008. In Austria, it reached the thirteenth and in Switzerland the twenty-second place. In Germany it was the 41st-best-selling album of the year in 2008.

==Instruments==
Besides the electric guitar, bass and drum set, In Extremo defines itself by unconventional (for a rock band) instruments mainly of medieval origin. They include hurdy-gurdy, bagpipes, Uilleann Pipes, shawm, nyckelharpa, harp, cittern, tromba marina, hammered dulcimer, Klangbaum and various types of drums and percussion. Bagpipes are the most conspicuous of these instruments, as Dr. Pymonte, Yellow Pfeiffer (until 2021), and Flex der Biegsame all play bagpipes, sometimes all three at once. All of the band members play multiple instruments, and frequently rotate instruments between songs; Das letzte Einhorn frequently plays a cittern during certain songs, such as &quot;Ai vis lo lop&quot;.

Their bagpipes were partially made by Dr. Pymonte, but are also partially built by a well-known pipe builder. The band also uses a custom-built frame drum covered in zebra skin, called &quot;Das Pferd&quot; (&quot;The Horse&quot;). Most of the other acoustic instruments, such as their shawms, are only made by a few other instrument builders.

==Style and lyrics==

Some lyrics are not written by the band, but some – like the instruments – from traditional songs written during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

Many of the lyrics to the band&#x27;s repertoire of medieval songs come from church writings (e.g. &quot;Wessebronner Gebet&quot;), Benedictine writings (e.g. &quot;Raue See&quot;) or are &quot;trad. arr.&quot;, meaning traditional songs with unknown authors, rearranged by the band (e.g. &quot;Merseburger Zaubersprüche&quot;, &quot;Tannhuser&quot;, &quot;Poc Vecem&quot;). The band also frequently uses songs from the Carmina Burana, a medieval collection of songs, as well as lyrics written as poetry by the 15th-century French poet François Villon (&quot;Rotes Haar&quot; and &quot;Erdbeermund&quot;; translated into German by Paul Zech).

The band also uses poems from later writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (&quot;Der Rattenfänger&quot; - &quot;The Rat Catcher&quot;) and Ludwig Uhland, who wrote &quot;Des Sängers Fluch&quot; (&quot;The Singer&#x27;s Curse&quot;) – which In Extremo changed to be called &quot;Spielmannsfluch&quot; (&quot;The Minstrel&#x27;s Curse&quot;). For the album &quot;Mein rasend Herz&quot;, In Extremo originally wrote the lyrics to the song &quot;Liam&quot; in German, after which it was translated into Irish by Rea Garvey, who was also a guest singer on the song.

<doc id="441004" wikidata="Q793616" url="?curid=441004" title="Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland">
<text>Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway, Duke of Västergötland (27 February 1861 – 24 October 1951) was a Swedish prince. Through his daughters Märtha and Astrid, for whom he arranged dynastic marriages, he is an ancestor of current members of the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg, Belgian royal family and Norwegian royal family.

==Early life==
Prince Carl was born on at his parents&#x27; residence in the Arvfurstens palats (&quot;Palace of the Hereditary Prince&quot;), an 18th century palace located at Gustav Adolfs Torg in central Stockholm. Born into the House of Bernadotte, he was the third son and child of the then Prince Oscar and Princess Sophia. His father was the younger brother and heir presumptive of the reigning king of Sweden-Norway, the sonless King Charles XV, and his mother was the youngest daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau. Upon the death of Charles XV on 18 September 1872, Carl&#x27;s father ascended the Swedish and Norwegian thrones as King Oscar II.
Carl was known as &quot;the Blue Prince&quot; (&quot;Blå Prinsen&quot;) because he often wore the blue-coloured uniform of the Life Regiment, to which he belonged in a ceremonial manner.

==Marriage and children==

In May 1897, Prince Carl was engaged at the age of 36 to the 18-year-old Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, the second daughter of King Frederik VIII of Denmark. Ingeborg&#x27;s mother, Louise of Sweden, was a first cousin of Prince Carl, and they were, therefore, first cousins once-removed. The engagement was arranged, and in 1947, on the occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary, Carl admitted that their marriage had been completely arranged by their respective fathers, and Ingeborg herself added: &quot;I married a complete stranger!&quot;

The couple were married on 27 August 1897 at the chapel of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen and spent their wedding trip (honeymoon) in Germany. The couple had four children:

# Margaretha (1899–1977), who married Prince Axel of Denmark
# Märtha (1901–1954), wife of Crown Prince Olav of Norway and mother of Harald V of Norway
# Astrid (1905–1935), wife of Leopold III of Belgium and mother of kings Baudouin and Albert II of Belgium, as well as Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte of Luxembourg.
# Carl, Duke of Östergötland, known as &quot;Carl Jr.&quot;, later &quot;Prince Bernadotte&quot; (1911–2003).

All of Carl&#x27;s children grew up to be healthy adults. While all three daughters made dynastic marriages that were encouraged by their parents, and became the matriarchs of their own successful families, the couple&#x27;s only son gave up his (highly improbable) chance of succeeding to the throne to marry a noblewoman.

==Candidate for the Norwegian throne==
In 1905, during the political struggle in which Norway obtained its independence from Sweden, Prince Carl was seriously considered as a candidate for the Norwegian crown. It was thought that electing a Swedish prince as king was a less radical way for Norway to secede from the union, and hence a more peaceful approach. Carl was chosen because his eldest brother would inherit the Swedish throne, and his second brother had renounced his royal status to make an unsuitable marriage. However, Carl&#x27;s father King Oscar II of Sweden did not approve of the proposal, as he saw the whole &quot;riot&quot; which precipitated the Norwegian crisis as a conspiracy and a betrayal against his rights as King of Norway, and he did not want any of his sons to be involved with people whom he considered his enemies. Therefore, Prince Carl never became King of Norway. Instead, another Prince Carl – Prince Carl of Denmark – brother of Ingeborg, was elected after some diplomatic turbulence, taking the name Haakon VII. As history turned out however, the Duke of Västergötland&#x27;s daughter, Princess Märtha, married Haakon VII&#x27;s son, who later became King Olav V. Hence, the present King, Harald V of Norway, is a grandchild of the duke.

==Descendants==
Prince Carl has the distinction of being a grandfather of three reigning European monarchs: King Harald V of Norway (son of his daughter, Princess Märtha), the late King Baudouin of the Belgians and his brother, King Albert II of the Belgians (sons of his daughter, Princess Astrid). He is also a great-grandfather of King Philippe of the Belgians and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.

<text>Chrisp Street Market is the central marketplace and town centre of Poplar and is located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It was the first purpose-built pedestrian shopping area in the United Kingdom, rebuilt as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain and is directly connected onto the high street, East India Dock Road.

It features a prominent clock tower, shops, small retail outlets, pubs, cafes, flats, and 80 market stalls.

==History==
Chrisp Street Market was designed by Frederick Gibberd, and built as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951. Since 1997 it has been in a conservation area.

In the 1990s, the London Docklands Development Corporation contributed £1.3 million to refurbishment of the market area.

In the early 2000s, Chrisp St Library was closed and replaced with a larger &#x27;Idea Store&#x27; designed by David Adjaye, a place for lifelong learning with computers and rooms for community use.

The Tower Hamlets London Borough Council transferred ownership of the shopping arcades along with the rest of the Lansbury Estate to Poplar HARCA, a locally based housing association, in 2006. This association commissioned architects to draw up a master plan for the market.

, the commercial properties are managed by Capital Properties (UK) Ltd, while the market stalls remain under the management of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

The market was the main focus point and filming location of &quot;E14: A Dying Trade&quot;, a short documentary filmed in 2011.

== Chrisp Street On Air ==
From November 2013 to April 2014, Chrisp Street Market was host to a project entitled &#x27;Chrisp Street On Air&#x27; - a pilot exercise in rejuvenating London markets. The project, conceived by multidisciplinary design firm The Decorators, began with a radio station set up within the market and available online. The radio station invited locals to explore the market&#x27;s history, character, and future. The radio component also informed a further programme of events in conjunction with local organisations, such as a boxing exhibition with the Lansbury Amateur Boxing Club. The project also incorporated new market furniture for eating, along with stalls to facilitate the events. Poplar HARCA, the owner of the market, used recommendations based on the project to apply to the Greater London Authority for a new round of funding.

==Dining==
East End of London favourites such as pie and mash are available alongside Chinese and Indian food outlets. Chrisp St Market also hosts &quot;Bite&quot;, a monthly street food market taking place on the last Friday of each month.

==Transport==

===Trains===

The market is served by All Saints and Langdon Park DLR stations.

===Buses===

London Buses Routes 15, 108, 115, D6, 309, D8 and Night Route N15 serve the market.

<doc id="441012" wikidata="Q889083" url="?curid=441012" title="Rafael Iglesias Castro">
<text>Rafael Anselmo José Iglesias Castro, also known as Rafael Yglesias (18 April 1861 – 10 April 1924) was a Costa Rican politician who served as President of Costa Rica for two consecutive periods from 1894 to 1902.

== Biography ==

He was born to Demetrio Iglesias Llorente and Eudoxia Castro Fernandez, whose father was also president, the &quot;Founder of the Republic&quot; José María Castro who served two terms, 1847–1849 and 1866–1868. Iglesias traveled to the United States and to Europe to further his education. He also studied law at the University of Santo Tomas, but was unable to complete his studies due to his parents&#x27; economic difficulties at the time. He went into business, but did not meet with much success in that arena.

He got married in a civil ceremony to Rosa Banuet Ross in Cartago. They had two girls, Berta and Rosa (*official records of this marriage were destroyed in the earthquake of Cartago in 1910). He served as Minister of War from 1890-4. Iglesias and Rosa were divorced due to family pressure, and he married Manuela Petronila de la Trinidad Rodríguez Alvarado, daughter of President José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón (1890–1894). She was a private woman, and did not share his enthusiasm for the political arena. They had a happy domestic partnership, and produced eleven children; Miguel, Eduardo, Luisa, Eudoxia, Bernardo Rafael, Margarita, Maria de los Angeles, Manuel, Jose Maria and Rafael.

== Presidency ==

In 1894, at the age of 33, Iglesias was elected president by a majority of 23,000, and his election was marked with by largest voter turnout to date. Upon his election, he made official visits to Paris and London. He had an audience with Queen Victoria, for whom he had great respect. Duly impressed by the technological advancements he saw in Europe, he decided to return to Costa Rica and modernize it.

He completed the construction of a national theater (Teatro Nacional), and was present at its inaugural performance of &quot;Faust&quot; presented by a French company under the auspices of Frederic Aubrey. He established the colon as the unit of currency, and put Costa Rica on the gold standard. He completed the Atlantic to Pacific railway, and built up the coastal town of Puerto Limon. In addition, he set up a department of sanitation in the city.

He oversaw the building of an electric tram, and brought municipal electricity to the city of Heredia. He established a house of correction for minors. He also instituted educational reforms, establishing a precedent for text books to be authored by Costa Rican citizens. A firm believer in public education, he founded a school for the arts (Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes) in 1897.

Iglesias was the first president to send a scientific expedition to Isla del Coco. Hearing of its rich natural resources, Iglesias closed the penal colony that was there, and decreed the island a nature preserve.

Iglesias established a system of emergency health care in the provinces. In 1895, Congress approved a measure to create a board of medicine, surgery and pharmacy, composed of all the doctors, surgeons and pharmacists that had been nationally certified. In 1902, he established the pharmaceutical college (Instituto de Farmacia).

He tried to amend the constitution to allow for a third term, but was defeated. He ran for president again in 1909 and 1913, but was never re-elected.

== Later life and death ==

Iglesias still kept his hand in politics, and served, in 1919, as Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Guatemala.

Iglesias died in San Jose in 1924, and was buried in the Cementerio General de San Jose.

In 1981 he was awarded the title of &quot;Benemerito de la Patria&quot; for his years of service.

Rafael Iglesias appeared on Costa Rican paper money in the former denomination of 5 colones. This edition was first printed in 1968.

Also, Rafael Iglesias appeared on Costa Rica postal stamps, in different editions.

<doc id="441015" wikidata="Q435739" url="?curid=441015" title="Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland">
<text>Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, Duke of Södermanland (Carl Wilhelm Ludvig; 17 June 1884 – 5 June 1965) was a Swedish and Norwegian prince. He authored many books (primarily in Swedish) as Prins Wilhelm.

==Personal life==

Wilhelm was born at Tullgarn Palace, the second son of King Gustaf V of Sweden and his wife Victoria of Baden. 

===Marriage and divorce===
On 3 May 1908, in Tsarskoye Selo, Wilhelm married Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, a daughter of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia by his first wife Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. The bride was a cousin of the reigning Russian tsar, Nicholas II. The couple had one son: Lennart (1909–2004).

The marriage was unhappy. Their son, Lennart, later wrote an autobiography in which he revealed several details of the Swedish royal family. The autobiography tells of how Maria, like her aunt and namesake Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, felt that she had married beneath herself in marrying a younger son of the King of Sweden, and this caused problems of ego between the couple. Maria insisted that the servants address her by her correct style &quot;Your Imperial and Royal Highness,&quot; to the chagrin of her husband, who was merely a &quot;Royal Highness.&quot; When apprised of the matter, Wilhelm&#x27;s father King Gustav V had no choice but to acquiesce with his daughter-in-law&#x27;s wish, which was perfectly valid in law, and ordered that the imperial style be used invariably for Maria. 

Maria sought a divorce because of what she described as the horror she then felt toward the Swedish royal family, due to their unlimited support of their official physician, Axel Munthe, who had accosted her sexually. The divorce was granted in 1914, and Maria returned to Russia.

===Later life===
Wilhelm had a relationship, which was not publicly known, with Jeanne de Tramcourt which lasted from around 1914 (starting date unknown) until Jeanne&#x27;s death in 1952. They lived together for more than 30 years on the estate Stenhammar near Flen. This was at a time when cohabitation was very unusual and not officially allowed to occur among royalty. Jeanne de Tramcourt was therefore called his &quot;hostess&quot; at Stenhammar. On 2 January 1952 she died in a car accident in a snowstorm near Stjärnhov in Södermanland, when they were on their way to Stenhammar after visiting Wilhelm&#x27;s son Lennart. Wilhelm was driving when the accident took place. After this tragedy, he is said never to have recovered.

===Career and interests===
Wilhelm was a noted photographer and the author of several books written in Swedish under the pen name Prins Wilhelm.

In keeping with protocol demanded of royalty in modern democracies, Wilhelm kept studiously away from politics. One of his rare forays into the political sphere happened during the Second World War, following the murder of the Danish playwright and Lutheran pastor Kaj Munk on 4 January 1944. It was alleged, perhaps correctly, that the occupying German forces (specifically the Gestapo) were behind the murder, and the Danish resistance newspaper &quot;De frie Danske&quot; carried condemnatory reactions from numerous influential Scandinavians. Wilhelm was one of those who condemned the murder.

===Death===

Wilhelm suffered from emphysema caused by several years of chain smoking and died in his sleep, from a heart attack, in Flen, just 12 days before his 81st birthday.

==Honours and awards==
He received the following orders and decorations:&lt;ref name=&quot;(Sveriges statskalender / 1955)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón (6 January 1837 – 30 November 1917) was President of Costa Rica from 1890 to 1894.

Rodríguez was born on 6 January 1837. He studied law at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala, but owing to family matters and economic circumstances he had to break off his studies and return to Costa Rica. However, he did eventually graduate with a law degree from the &quot;Universidad de Santo Tomás&quot; in San José.

He was a prestigious lawyer who had never made any active forays into the country&#x27;s politics, but he had distinguished himself as the Magistrate of the Supreme Court of Justice (&quot;Corte Suprema de Justicia&quot;). For a short time he also occupied the post of Secretary of State in Bernardo Soto&#x27;s government.

He attained the presidency by being elected with a considerable majority, ushering in a new era for the country that would end with imposed governments.

Rodríguez sought the clergy&#x27;s support to be able to govern. The liberals became alarmed and decided to support the president, who accepted this group&#x27;s collaboration, succeeding in beating the Catholic Party in the midterm elections for deputies.

In 1892, he dissolved the Congress, and even as dictator kept the title President. In 1893 he established once again individual guarantees so that voting for his successor could go ahead with greater freedom. The winner was the Minister of War and the Navy, Don Rafael Yglesias Castro, the Civil Party candidate.

Rodríguez had to govern during a time of great conflict and his main preoccupation was his homeland&#x27;s welfare. His methods of keeping order have been censured by the citizenry.

Among his successes are his measures favouring education. He established night schools for adults in the national capital and provincial cities. He hailed the contract to establish the telephone service in the capital and the provinces. He started construction on the National Theatre.

José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón died on 30 November 1917.

== Personal life ==
Rodríguez&#x27;s parents were Sebastián Rodríguez Mora and Francisca Zeledón Aguilar. His wife was Luisa Alvarado Carrillo. They had several children together and, coincidentally, one of them, Manuela Rodríguez Alvarado, married Rodríguez&#x27;s successor, Rafael Yglesias Castro.

== Rodríguez&#x27;s main successes ==
* He signed contracts to establish Costa Rica&#x27;s first telephone service in 1891.
* He favoured education and created night schools for adults.
* He started construction on the National Theatre in 1890.
* He promoted European immigration for the country&#x27;s colonization and agricultural development.

<text>Jan Władysław Rokita (, born 18 June 1959) is a Polish liberal conservative politician, a member of the Sejm, the lower chamber of the Polish parliament. He was chairman of the parliamentary club of the Civic Platform party from 2003 to 2005.

He was a Member of the Sejm of Poland in X, I, II, III, IV I V convocations, co-founder of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and its president in 2000–2002.

==Biography==
Jan Rokita was born in Kraków as a son of Tadeusz Rokita and Adela Wajdowicz. His maternal grandmother, Maria Meder, was Austrian.

Rokita graduated from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków with a degree in law. He joined the dissident organisation &quot;Freedom and Peace&quot;. He also took part in the Independent Students Union and was active as a member of the academic branch of Solidarity. For his activity in the opposition, he was banned from becoming an apprentice attorney, despite his excellent examination record.

In 1989, he was elected an MP as a Solidarity candidate. He was appointed the president of a special parliamentary commission for the investigation of the Security Service (Służba Bezpieczeństwa). In 1991, he joined Democratic Union (UD) party. He was a member of the party&#x27;s right wing.

In Hanna Suchocka&#x27;s government, he was the chief of the Council of Ministers office. In 1995, he was the co-founder of the &quot;3/4 initiative&quot; – a movement created in order to prevent Aleksander Kwaśniewski from winning the presidential elections and refused to support his party&#x27;s candidate Jacek Kuroń.

In 1997, he left Freedom Union (successor of the UD) and joined another political party – Conservative People&#x27;s Party. He was elected to the Sejm for the fourth time from Solidarity Electoral Action coalition list, becoming chairman of the parliamentary Interior Affairs Committee. In 2000 he was elected leader of the SKL.

When the Civic Platform was formed in January 2000, Rokita was reluctant to ally SKL with it, but a steady trickle of members to the new center right party forced him to.

In 2001, Rokita was elected to the Sejm for the fifth time, as a PO candidate. In 2002, he ran for office to be Mayor of Kraków, but without success.

In 2003, he was elected to Sejm&#x27;s special investigative committee for the Lew Rywin affair. His participation in the committee has given him a tough inquisitor image and made him very popular, effectively resurrecting him as an active politician. In consequence, PO&#x27;s opinion polls ratings skyrocketed.

When the negotiations for the future European constitution started in the end of 2003, he coined the slogan: &quot;Nicea o muerte – Nicea albo śmierć&quot; ((Treaty of) Nice or death), which was more or less the official position of the Polish delegation. He later softened his position on the constitution.

His first wife was Katarzyna Zimmerer, Polish-Jewish journalist. Now Rokita is married to his second wife Nelly Rokita, an ethnic German from Chelyabinsk, Russia. Nelly has a daughter from her first marriage.

In July 2007, he was sentenced to pay a fine for calling Grzegorz Wieczerzak &quot;a very famous criminal&quot;.

In 2006, Jan Rokita became the coordinator of the so-called shadow office. In 2007, he gave up further political activity. On 14 September 2007, Rokita announced he would not be seeking re-election in the 2007 Polish elections. Officially, he claimed it was because of his wife Nelly&#x27;s decision to enter Polish politics as an advisor to President Lech Kaczyński (affiliated with the right-wing Law and Justice Party). However, it was well documented that in the run up to the elections he and his supporters within the Civic Platform had become increasingly marginalised, and he claimed he could not communicate with section of Civic Platform in Kraków. Despite this, he did not leave Civic Platform and went on record that he would cast his vote for the party.

== Awards ==

* Kisel Prize (2003);
* &quot;Man of the Year&quot; according to the Wprost weekly (2003);
* Commander Cross the Order of the Renaissance of Poland (2008);
* The medal is &quot;Invincible in the word&quot; (11 December 2011).
* Cross of Freedom and Solidarity (2018);

<text>Oxford Brookes University (OBU; formerly known as Oxford Polytechnic) is a public university in Oxford, England. It is a new university, having received university status through the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The university was named after its first principal, John Henry Brookes, who played a major role in the development of the institution.

Oxford Brookes University is spread across four campuses, with three primary sites based in and around Oxford and the fourth campus located in Swindon. Oxford Brookes University planned to demolish its Wheatley campus and build houses on the site; the local council refused planning permission, but Oxford Brookes appealed, and won in 2020. the Brookes web site said that the institution had 16,900 students, 2,800 staff and over 190,000 alumni in over 177 countries. The university is divided into four faculties: Oxford Brookes Business School, Health and Life Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Technology, Design and Environment. Oxford Brookes University&#x27;s partnership with the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) allows ACCA students to earn a BSc (Hons) in applied accounting with the submission of a research and analysis project work while taking their ACCA examinations. The university also has schools of architecture and law. Brookes is a member of the University Alliance mission.

==History==
Oxford Brookes University started in 1865 as the Oxford School of Art, located in a single room on the ground floor of the Taylor Institution at St Giles&#x27;, Oxford. In 1870 the School of Science was added and in 1891, under the administration of the City Council&#x27;s Technical Instruction Committee, it was renamed the Oxford City Technical School, incorporating the School of Art, which remained distinct. Plans were made to relocate to the former Blue Coat School for Boys on St. Ebbes.

In 1934 the School of Art and the Technical School were merged and John Henry Brookes, head of the School of Art and vice-principal of the Technical School, was appointed the first principal of the merged institution, called the Schools of Technology, Art and Commerce. By 1950 the college had 4,000 students. A new campus was built on a site offered by the local Morrell brewing family. Renamed &quot;Oxford College of Technology&quot;, it opened on the new site in 1956. Its first residence hall was established in 1960 and the college relocated to Headington in 1963.

In 1970, it became Oxford Polytechnic. In 1976, it took over the former Lady Spencer-Churchill College, which had been founded in Wheatley in August 1965. In 1992 it incorporated the Dorset House School of Occupational Therapy, the first school of occupational therapy in the UK. Later in 1992, following enactment of the Further and Higher Education Act, it became Oxford Brookes University, the only one of the new universities to be named after its founder. In 2000, it took over the site of Westminster College, Oxford, basing its education and theological activities on the site, although theology was withdrawn in 2015.

In October 2003, Oxford Brookes University became the first university in the world to be awarded Fairtrade status.

Baroness Kennedy served as the university&#x27;s chancellor from 1994 to 2001. In 2007, Graham Upton retired as vice-chancellor and his successor, Janet Beer, was inaugurated in September. In July 2008, Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, replaced Jon Snow as chancellor.

In March 2015, Alistair Fitt was inaugurated as vice-chancellor, replacing Janet Beer. In May 2022, Brookes Union released a letter stating the student body had filed a no confidence motion against Fitt. Dame Katherine Grainger, a former British Olympic rower, replaced Shami Chakrabarti as chancellor. Grainger was Britain&#x27;s most decorated female Olympic athlete and the first British woman to win medals at five successive games (Rio 2016, London 2012, Beijing in 2008, Athens in 2004 and Sydney in 2000). She was made a dame for her services to rowing and charity in the 2017 New Years Honours. In June 2020 Katherine Grainger stood down as chancellor, with Paterson Joseph appointed in October 2022.

In 2015, Oxford Brookes University celebrated its 150th anniversary. A range of events and activities took place, including celebrations recognising John Henry Brookes, the university&#x27;s modern founder. The first founder&#x27;s day was held in May 2016.

==Campuses==
Oxford Brookes University has three main campuses and a fourth in Swindon.

Headington campus


The Headington campus is in a residential area of Oxford. The campus is made up of three sites; the main site on Gipsy Lane, home to a number of departments from across the university&#x27;s four academic faculties and the £132m John Henry Brookes Building which opened in 2014. Across the road is the Headington Hill Hall site, home to the School of Arts and School of Law, and a short walk from main site is the Marston Road site a dedicated space for the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences and home to subjects including nursing, midwifery and occupational therapy.

Located on the campus are the main halls of residence, including Crescent Hall, Cheney Student Village, Clive Booth Hall, Clive Booth non-en suite (formerly Morrell Hall) and Warneford Hall.

Wheatley campus

The Wheatley campus is near Wheatley in the Oxfordshire countryside, seven miles south-east of the city centre. It is where information technology, mathematics and engineering are taught. The tall tower block can be seen from the A40 dual carriageway. The top four floors of the tower were initially closed in the early 2000s following the suicide of a student from the top. Five years later the rest of the tower was shut after asbestos was found and the building was deemed unsafe to house students. The campus is set for closure in the future, when the subjects taught at Wheatley are due to be moved to the Headington campus.

Harcourt Hill campus

The Harcourt Hill campus is situated on Harcourt Hill on Oxford&#x27;s western perimeter, two and a half miles from the city centre. Education, philosophy, religion, theology, media and communication, and other subjects are taught here. It has two halls of residence: Harcourt Hill Hall and Westminster Hall. A regular devoted bus service links the campus to other campuses at Headington and Wheatley. It is also home to the university&#x27;s leisure centre.

The campus was formerly the site of Westminster College, Oxford, an independent Methodist higher education institution which specialised in teacher training and theology. The campus was leased to Brookes by the Methodist Church, and Westminster College became the Westminster Institute of Education of Oxford Brookes University, located at the Harcourt Hill campus.

Swindon campus

Oxford Brookes University opened its Swindon campus in August 2016. The university moved from the former Ferndale campus in Swindon to a new and larger campus situated to the west of the town centre at the Delta Business Park. The building is named the Joel Joffe Building after Lord Joel Joffe, long-time Swindon resident and former human-rights lawyer. Adult nursing, operating department practice (ODP) and a range of continuing professional development (CPD) courses are taught there. The campus features a 185-seat lecture theatre, library and social learning spaces, teaching rooms and three clinical skills suites. Oxford Brookes University partners with Swindon College as part of its Associate College Partnership to deliver foundation and degree courses, provides widening participation activity with local schools.

===Redevelopment===
In recent years the university has seen major redevelopments including the opening of the £132 million John Henry Brookes Building, named after the university&#x27;s spiritual leader, which opened on the Headington campus in 2014. It brings together the library and teaching spaces with student support services and the Students&#x27; Union (Brookes Union), who were formerly housed in the Helena Kennedy Centre on the Headington Hill site. The building has won multiple awards including a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) National Award; three RIBA regional awards; Oxford Preservation Trust Award and the Student Experience category of the 2014 Education Estates Awards.

The university&#x27;s original redevelopment proposals were vigorously opposed by local residents in 2009 when presented to the local planning committee, with many undesirable aspects of the large student population in Oxford being discussed. However, the plans for the new building were eventually approved and building work began in 2010.

In 2013 the redeveloped Abercrombie Building opened on the Headington campus, offering facilities for architecture students with design studios and collaborative learning spaces. In October 2014 it won the Architects&#x27; Journal Retrofit Award.

In January 2015 Oxford Brookes University announced a major estates investment for the next 10 years, with £13 million per year to be spent on redevelopment across all its campuses. This is to include additional building on the Headington and Harcourt campuses as well as a new campus in Swindon. Part of this investment will see all activity moved from the Wheatley campus by 2021/22. The Oxford Brookes Business School moved from the Wheatley campus to refurbished buildings at Headington campus in 2017 with plans for other departments to move to new buildings on the Headington Hill site in the future, many of which were postponed due to COVID-19 and issues with budgets.

Wheatley campus ceased operation in 2024 and the New Headington Hill Building (NHHB) opened in January 2025 to accommodate those subjects. Harcourt Hill campus is planned to transfer to Headington Campus for the start of the 2025/26 academic year.

The union offers a range of services for students; it hosts a number of student societies, a safety bus service, an advice service, and a system of student representatives. In 2012, Oxford Brookes students&#x27; union was ranked amongst the worst in the country for student satisfaction, according to the National Student Survey (NSS), where only 34% of students claimed to be content with the students&#x27; union.

===Accommodation===

There are currently 12 student halls four of which are on Headington campus, two on the Harcourt Hill campus, one on the Wheatley campus and three more halls around Headington. In addition, there are five privately operated halls of residence which are managed in partnership with the university by housing associations: Slade Park Student Apartments, Parade Green, Sinnet Court Student Apartments, Beech House Student Accommodation and Dorset House Student Apartments.

* Cheney Student Village
* Clive Booth Student Village
* Crescent Hall
* Westminster Hall
* Lady Spencer Churchill Hall
*Paul Kent Hall
*Slade Park

<doc id="441034" wikidata="Q7986638" url="?curid=441034" title="West Tennessee">
<text>West Tennessee is one of the three Grand Divisions of Tennessee that roughly comprises the western quarter of the state. The region includes 21 counties between the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers, delineated by state law. Its geography consists primarily of flat lands with rich soil and vast floodplain areas of the Mississippi River. Of the three regions, West Tennessee is the most sharply defined geographically, and is the lowest-lying. It is both the least populous and smallest, in land area, of the three Grand Divisions. Its largest city is Memphis, the state&#x27;s second most populous city.

West Tennessee was originally inhabited by the Chickasaw, and was the last of the three Grand Divisions to be settled by Europeans. The region officially became part of the United States with the Jackson Purchase in 1818, 22 years after Tennessee&#x27;s statehood. As part of the Mississippi River basin, West Tennessee enjoys rich soil that led to large-scale cotton farming during the antebellum period that was heavily dependent on slave labor. As a result, it forms the northwestern tip of the Black Belt.

==History==
===Early history===
The first Europeans to reach what is now West Tennessee were part of an expedition led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who in 1541 became the first Europeans to reach the Mississippi River south of present-day Memphis. In 1673, a French expedition led by missionary Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River, becoming the first Europeans to map the Mississippi Valley.

In 1682, a French expedition led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle constructed Fort Prudhomme on the Chickasaw Bluffs along the Mississippi River north of present-day Memphis. In 1739, the French constructed Fort Assumption under the command of Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville on the Mississippi River at the present-day location of Memphis, which they used as a base against the Chickasaw during the 1739 Campaign of the Chickasaw Wars.

In 1795, Spanish Governor-General of Louisiana, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, sent his lieutenant governor, Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, to negotiate an agreement with the local Chickasaw so that a fort could be erected on the Chickasaw Bluffs in present-day Memphis. Fort San Fernando De Las Barrancas was established in May of that year to defend Spanish claims and prevent further westward expansion of the United States.

The part of Tennessee west of the Tennessee River was first recognized as Chickasaw territory by the 1786 Treaty of Hopewell, and continued to be after Tennessee&#x27;s statehood in 1796. However, both the state&#x27;s constitution and the legislative act that admitted Tennessee to the Union defined the region as part of the state. West Tennessee did not come under American control until it was obtained in a series of cessions by the Chickasaw in 1818, an acquisition known as the Jackson Purchase, which was negotiated by Andrew Jackson, who later became the 7th President of the United States, and former-Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby. This purchase also included the westernmost area of Kentucky as well as a part of northern Mississippi.

Although the vast majority of the purchase area lies in Tennessee, the term &quot;Jackson Purchase&quot; is used today mostly to refer solely to the Kentuckian portion of the acquisition. After West Tennessee was opened to European settlement in 1818, cotton planters began exploiting the fertile soils of the region in the 1820s, and an agrarian economy, heavily dependent on African American slave labor took hold in the region. West Tennessee quickly became one of the most productive cotton-producing regions in the nation, along with much of the Deep South and the largest cotton-farming region in Tennessee.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
After the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, most West Tennesseans favored joining the Confederacy in order to preserve the slavery-based economy of the region. This was true throughout most of West Tennessee, with the exception of the southeastern parts of the region along the Tennessee River, where the terrains and soils did not allow for large plantations as in most of West Tennessee. As a result, most residents of this area were Unionists. In 1860, slaves composed more than one third of West Tennessee&#x27;s population, compared to about one fourth statewide. This was the highest percentage of the state&#x27;s three Grand Divisions, although Middle Tennessee had more slaves.

A number of crucial battles and events took place in West Tennessee during the Civil War. In February 1862, the U.S. Navy, under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant, captured the Tennessee River in February 1862 at the Battle of Fort Henry near the Kentucky border. Grant then proceeded south to Pittsburg Landing, and two months later held off a Confederate counterattack, led by Albert Sidney Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard at the Battle of Shiloh, which was the bloodiest battle of the war at the time. This battle claimed the life of Johnston, and remained one of the most costly engagements of the entire war. Memphis fell to the Union in June after a naval battle on the Mississippi River, which effectively resulted in the Union gaining control of West Tennessee. In an effort to disrupt Grant&#x27;s campaign southward along the Mississippi River, Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest launched a series of offensives into West Tennessee between December 1862 and January 1863, which resulted in Confederate victories in minor battles at Lexington and Jackson, as well as a disputed outcome at Parker&#x27;s Crossroads. The raids failed to completely stop Grant&#x27;s movement southward. One of the most notorious events of the war occurred in April 1864 in Lauderdale County, when Confederate troops under Forrest&#x27;s command massacred hundreds of surrendering Union soldiers, most of whom were Black.

Like most of the South, West Tennessee was greatly devastated by the effects of the Civil War. After the War and during the beginning of Reconstruction, most large cotton plantations were divided into smaller farms. Most freed slaves were forced into sharecropping, and many also worked as agricultural wage laborers. The region was characterized by racial tension between former slaves and their White allies and former Confederates, which often resulted in violence and lynchings perpetrated by the latter, and continued for many decades afterwards. One of the worst acts of racial violence in the Reconstruction era occurred in Memphis in 1866, when White mobs attacked and looted Black neighborhoods in the city, killing 46.

A number of deadly epidemics swept though the region during this time, including yellow fever, which killed more than one-tenth of Memphis&#x27; residents in 1878 and caused the city to temporarily lose its charter. Many rural West Tennesseans relocated to Memphis and other cities during the latter 19th century. While the region remained predominantly rural, Memphis experienced modest industrialization, and became known as the &quot;Cotton Capitol of the World&quot; during the late 19th century.

===20th century===
As part of the first wave of the Great Migration, many African American West Tennesseans relocated to industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest for better economic opportunities and to escape increasing racial segregation imposed by Jim Crow laws passed by the state legislature.

During this time, many West Tennessee residents, Black and White, also relocated from rural areas to Memphis and other cities in the state. Beginning during this time and lasting until the latter 20th century, Memphis experienced an explosive population and economic boom, whereas the population of most West Tennessee counties remained relatively stagnant or declined. Smaller cities such as Jackson and Dyersburg also experienced modest industrialization during this time.

West Tennessee was particularly devastated by the Great Depression, even by national standards. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) played a much lesser role in the region than in the rest of the state, but constructed Pickwick Landing Dam on the Tennessee River in Hardin County, and resulted in the electrification of many rural parts of the region. During World War II, the U.S. Army constructed an ammunition plant in Milan, which also later produced ammunition for the Korean War and Vietnam War. As part of the second wave of the Great Migration, African Americans fled West Tennessee in greater numbers than before, which further exacerbated population decline in rural counties.

In 1960, a number of African American sharecroppers in majority-Black Fayette and Haywood counties were evicted from their lands in retaliation for registering to vote. In response, they formed a makeshift encampment called Tent City with the assistance of Black landowners, which lasted until 1962. On April 4, 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis by James Earl Ray. King had traveled to Memphis days before to support striking African American sanitation workers. The construction of Interstate 40 through Memphis became a national talking point on the issue of eminent domain and grassroots lobbying when the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) attempted to construct the highway through the city&#x27;s Overton Park. A local activist group began fighting the project in 1957, and in 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the group and established the framework for judicial review of government agencies in the landmark case of &quot;Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe&quot;. The group&#x27;s efforts eventually resulted in TDOT cancelling the route in 1981.

===Recent history===
Since the 1960s, West Tennessee has seen cycles of population booms and stagnation. Agriculture has remained a central tenet of the region&#x27;s economy, and despite the creation of new economic sectors and employment opportunities, the region has not overall benefitted from these changes as much as the entire state overall.

==Geography==
West Tennessee is the smallest of the state&#x27;s three Grand Divisions, and has a land area of approximately , about 25.8% of the state&#x27;s total land area. The region is bounded by the Mississippi River to the west, and the Tennessee River to the east, except for in Hardin County, which is bisected by the Tennessee River. The region&#x27;s boundaries have been expanded slightly to include all of this county. The states of Kentucky and Mississippi provide the respective northern and southern boundaries, with the exception of a portion of Lauderdale County, Alabama, which lies southeast of the portion of Hardin County east of the Tennessee River. West Tennessee borders Arkansas and Missouri to the west.

West Tennessee is located almost entirely within the Mississippi Embayment, part of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Because of this, the terrain is flatter than the eastern parts of the state. Areas along the Mississippi River are located within the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, which is primarily a floodplain with many swamps. However, much of the western counties of the region are protected from flooding by the Chickasaw Bluffs, ridges of loess rising above the floodplain. Although the land is lower and flatter than Middle and East Tennessee, some hilly terrain exists, especially along the bluffs bordering the Mississippi River and the land bordering the Tennessee River, known as the West Tennessee Highlands. Hilly land in these areas is forested. Otherwise, most of the land in West Tennessee is used as farmland. The soil in this part of the state comes from when a prehistoric sea dried up and left sediment in its place. Unlike in the rest of the state, bedrock is buried a few thousand feet below the surface. West Tennessee&#x27;s highest elevation is approximately in Hardin County east of the Tennessee River, which is slightly lower than the state&#x27;s mean elevation of ; the region&#x27;s highest elevation west of the Tennessee River is approximately in Chester County. Tennessee&#x27;s lowest point can be found in West Tennessee; it is located at the extreme southwestern most part of Shelby County where the Mississippi River enters into Mississippi and continues in Arkansas. This point is according to the USGS, but fluctuates with river levels. 

===Hydrology===
Several rivers and streams, besides the Mississippi and Tennessee, exist in West Tennessee. All of them were originally slowly moving swamps or low-gradient meandering streams before nearly all of them were channelized in the 20th century. Rivers that empty into the Mississippi River include the Obion River, Forked Deer River, Hatchie River (which has not been channelized), Loosahatchie River, Wolf River, and Nonconnah Creek. Rivers that empty into the Tennessee River include the Big Sandy River and Beech River.

West Tennessee sits on top of an artesian aquifer. This aquifer is the main source of water for Memphis and Shelby County, as well as many other communities. In the Memphis area and areas along the bluffs, the loess and gravel serves as a cap over the sand making up the aquifer. The rest of West Tennessee serves as a recharge area for the aquifer. This aquifer provides some of the cleanest water in the United States.

===Seismology===
The entire West Tennessee region, especially the area closest to the Mississippi River, lies in a zone of fairly high estimated risk for earthquakes. This area is at the edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. In 1811 and 1812, three of the largest quakes in American history hit this region when it had few European settlers. By some reports, the earthquakes briefly reversed the flow of the Mississippi River. A lasting legacy of the earthquakes is the Reelfoot Lake, a large but shallow body of water in northwestern Tennessee that was created by the earthquakes.

==Demographics==

West Tennessee is by slight amounts less populous and smaller in land area than the other two Grand Divisions. At the 2020 census, West Tennessee had 1,557,649 inhabitants living in its 21 counties, a decrease of 4,992, or 0.32%, over the 2010 figure of 1,562,650. This was the first recorded net population decrease in any of the state&#x27;s three Grand Divisions in history. West Tennessee&#x27;s population was about 22.54% of the state&#x27;s total, and its population density was about . About 60% of the population of West Tennessee resides in Shelby County.

West Tennessee registered a population growth rate significantly below the state and national average (11.5% and 9.7% respectively) from 2000 to 2010, significantly less than that of Middle and East Tennessee (18.0% and 10.4%). West Tennessee&#x27;s population grew only 4.2% during the 10-year period; predominantly black Haywood County was the most rapidly diminishing county in the state, losing 5.1% of its population. Only three counties (Chester, Fayette, and Tipton, all increasingly playing a role as bedroom suburbs of metropolitan areas) recorded a growth rate of more than 10% from 2000 to 2010. Many West Tennessee counties are not on the state&#x27;s major transportation routes (railroads or highways) and have no air transport to speak of; and rely heavily on agriculture. With fewer farms and farmers, and the continuing decline of manufacturing, economic opportunities diminish in these counties, and young residents look outside the area for jobs, leading to substantial out-migration. Thus, the population in West Tennessee is increasingly older, with median ages above the state average in most counties; and the over-65 age group constitutes a larger percentage of the total population than the state average, leading in turn to a below-replacement-rate birth/death ratio, and economic decline, including empty and neglected housing and business structures.

==Economy==
Agriculture plays the largest role in the economy of West Tennessee out of all of the state&#x27;s Grand Divisions, and is arguably still the region&#x27;s largest economic sector. Tennessee ranks seventh in the nation in the production of cotton, nearly all of which is grown in West Tennessee. The northern half of West Tennessee also produces more corn and soybeans than any other region in the state. Other important agricultural commodities cultivated in the region include beef cattle, sorghum, wheat, poultry, and timber and forestry products.

West Tennessee is home to manufacturing establishments which produce such products as automotive components, chemicals, electronics, appliances, and fabricated metal products. On September 27, 2021, it was announced that Ford and SK Innovation would construct a complex at the Memphis Regional Megasite near Stanton called &quot;Blue Oval City&quot; to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries. The facility, which is expected to be operational in 2025, will cost approximately $5.6 billion, making it the most expensive single investment in state history, and employ approximately 5,700. Large corporations based in the region include FedEx, International Paper, First Horizon Corporation, and AutoZone, all based in Memphis. Tourism also plays a major role in the region&#x27;s economy, especially attractions related to its musical heritage. Major attractions include Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley, Beale Street, Sun Studio, the National Civil Rights Museum, the Memphis Zoo, and the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, all in Memphis; the Casey Jones Home &amp; Railroad Museum in Jackson, the West Tennessee Delta Heritage Center/Tina Turner Museum in Brownsville, and Discovery Park of America in Union City. The National Park Service operates Shiloh National Military Park, and Fort Donelson National Battlefield in West Tennessee.

==Politics==
Historically, West Tennessee was predominately Democratic following the American Civil War, but the significant minority of African Americans joined the Republican Party. The white-dominated state legislature in the 1880s passed four laws that effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites, particularly due to the requirement of payment of a poll tax in order to register to vote, which reduced the competitiveness of the Republican Party in this part of the state.

=== Government ===
West Tennessee is represented by part of the 7th district, and all of the 8th and 9th districts. The 7th district covers Benton, Decatur, Henderson, Hardeman, Chester, McNairy, and Hardin counties. The 8th district represents the remaining counties except for Memphis and Millington, which are represented by the 9th district.

The Supreme Court building for West Tennessee is in Jackson. Similar rules apply to certain other state commissions and boards, as well, to prevent them from showing any geographical biases.

==Area codes==
Until the year 2001, West Tennessee, including all of Hardin County, was in the area code 901. After a large amount of population growth necessitated two area codes for West Tennessee, Memphis, its northern and eastern suburbs, as well as Fayette and Tipton counties, retained the 901 area code, with the remainder of West Tennessee being placed into area code 731. The Memphis area is one of the largest metropolitan areas that does not require 10-digit dialing, and it is anticipated it will remain this way for many years to come.

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===
Interstate 40 (I-40) is West Tennessee&#x27;s primary interstate highway, which runs for from the Mississippi River in Memphis and crosses the Tennessee River in Benton County, passing near Brownsville and through Jackson in between. Interstate 240 (I-240) is an auxiliary bypass route of I-40 that runs to the south of Memphis. Interstate 55 (I-55) runs for , entirely within southwest Memphis, from the Mississippi state line to the Mississippi River. I-155 is located in the northwestern part of West Tennessee, running from the Mississippi River to Dyersburg. I-269 serves as an outer bypass around Memphis, passing to the east of the city. An extension of I-69 is proposed to run from the Mississippi state line in Memphis to the Kentucky line near South Fulton. The U.S. Highways that travel through West Tennessee are:

*U.S. Route 45
*U.S. Route 51
*U.S. Route 61
*U.S. Route 64
*U.S. Route 70
*U.S. Route 72
*U.S. Route 78
*U.S. Route 79
*U.S. Route 412
*U.S. Route 641
===Rail transport===
Freight railways crisscross West Tennessee. Norfolk Southern maintains a line running through the southern counties from Memphis to the shoals area of Alabama. They also maintain a line which runs from South Fulton through Martin, Milan, Jackson, and Selmer crossing into Mississippi. Canadian National runs a line from South Fulton, through Union City, Dyersburg and Memphis. From here the line splits into two: one runs through the Mississippi Delta and the other one runs through the center of Mississippi. BNSF runs through Memphis from Mississippi to downtown Memphis, crossing the River on the Frisco Bridge. Union Pacific maintains a short line through Memphis crossing the river on the Harahan Bridge and connects with other lines in the area. CSX runs a line from Memphis through Memphis, Brownsville, Humboldt, Milan, McKenzie, and Camden, then crossing the Tennessee River. Many other short line railroads exist scattered throughout the region.

There are three intermodal facilities around the Memphis area. One is operated by Norfolk Southern in Rossville, one operated by BNSF in Southeast Memphis, and one operated by Canadian National in Southwest Memphis.

Amtrak runs the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; passenger rail service along the CN rail line. There are two stops in West Tennessee along this route, which are in Downtown Memphis at Central Station and in Newbern north of Dyersburg.

===Airports===
West Tennessee has one international airport, Memphis International Airport (MEM). Because it is the hub for FedEx, it is the busiest freight airport in the world. West Tennessee also has two important regional airports. McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport (MKL) is located outside of Jackson and Dyersburg Regional Airport (DYR) is southwest of Dyersburg. In addition to these, several general aviation exist along with two former military airstrips. Arnold Field in Lauderdale County maintains an airstrip and Millington Regional Jetport serves as a backup landing strip for FedEx.

==Universities and colleges==
The public universities and colleges in West Tennessee are the University of Memphis, the University of Tennessee at Martin, Dyersburg State Community College, Jackson State Community College, Southwest Tennessee Community College, and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, which has state medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy schools, as well as a graduate program in health sciences. The University of Memphis has a branch campus in Jackson after taking over the former Lambuth University campus.

Private institutions of higher education located in the region include Christian Brothers University, LeMoyne–Owen College, Rhodes College, Union University, Lane College, Bethel University, and Freed-Hardeman University.

<text>Ramón Bernardo Soto Alfaro (12 February 1854 – 1931) was the Olympus President of Costa Rica from 1885 to 1889 during the Liberal State.

==Biography==
===Early life===
On 12 February 1854, Soto was born to Apolinar de Jesús Soto Quesada and Joaquina Alfaro Muñoz in Alajuela. In 1871, he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in science and arts in San José, and on 10 December 1877, he obtained his law degree in the University of Santo Tomás, practicing until 1880. The following year he was governor of Alajuela Province. In 1882, he became , and then Secretary of the Army and Navy. On 15 May 1885, congress made him divisional general and awarded him the honarary title &quot;Benemérito de la Patria&quot; (Meritorious of the Country); in the same year, he was decorated by the Venezuelan government and made academician of the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation of Spain.

===Presidency===
Soto succeeded his brother-in-law, Próspero Fernández Oreamuno, when he died in office on 12 March 1885; until 14 April, Costa Rica was still involved in Barrios&#x27; War of Reunification. On 19 April 1885, he married Fernández&#x27;s daughter Pacífica Fernández Guardia. On 4 December 1885, he signed a contract with Francisco María Fuentes and to allow the construction of hydroelectric-powered streetcars in San José. Soto&#x27;s administration continued Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez&#x27;s liberal economic and national developments. Soto-appointed minister of education Mauro Fernández Acuña reformed education and in that established two new high schools in San José; he staffed them with European scholars, among them being Henri Pittier. Soto&#x27;s administration opposed Chinese immigration and supported segregation for those already in the country. He violated the former in allowing Minor Keith to bring in 2,000 Chinese workers, who were made to leave after their contract expired. He ran unopposed in the 1886 general election after his uncle-in-law, , withdrew his candidacy three weeks before the first round for the &quot;well-being of the nation&quot;. When &quot;El Nacional&quot; continued to support the Guardia candidacy, &quot;Diario de Costa Rica&quot; labelled it &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and responded by publishing a letter claimed to by Guardia reinforcing his decision; ultimately, Guardia never renewed his candidacy due to pressure from pro-government sectors. On 24 April 1889, he and Minister of Foreign Affairs Manuel de Jesús Jiménez Oreamuno signed a letter addenda that agreed that Costa Rica would not interfere with the construction of the Nicaragua Canal by the Canal Company, reinforcing the convention of arbitration signed on 10 January.

During the 1889 general election, despite José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón&#x27;s prospects for victory, he declared Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra president-elect. On 7 November, Rafael Yglesias Castro inspired a peasant march armed with knives and sticks in San José. Due to fear of outrage turning into bloodshed, the same day, Soto had Carlos Durán Cartín, whom he appointed secretary of the interior in 1885, serve as interim president for the remainder of his term. Rodríguez was his official successor. The last time Soto neared the presidency was when conspiracies and assassination attempts formed around Yglesias&#x27;s second term as president after the 1897–1898 general election: suggestions by elites would have had Soto return to power but fell through, and Esquivel filled the position on 8 May 1902, to the agreement of Soto and Yglesias.

<text>Princess Margaretha of Sweden (Margaretha Sofia Lovisa Ingeborg; 25 June 1899 – 4 January 1977) was a member of the Swedish Royal Family by birth and the Danish Royal Family by marriage. She was the elder sister of Crown Princess Märtha of Norway and Queen Astrid of the Belgians.

==Early life==
Princess Margaretha was born on 25 June 1899 at her parents&#x27; summer residence, the &quot;Villa Parkudden&quot;, at Djurgården in Stockholm. The eldest child and daughter of Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, and Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, she was born Princess Margaretha of Sweden and Norway (later just &quot;of Sweden&quot;, due to the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905).

In 1916 Margaretha&#x27;s confirmation attracted enthusiastic press coverage; the event was said to mark the beginning of a new age for the Swedish royal house, which had lacked princesses for so long.

==Marriage and family==

On 22 May 1919, at the Storkyrkan, Stockholm, she was married to Prince Axel of Denmark, her maternal first cousin once removed. The marriage was a love match; her mother remarked that the couple were so much in love that they could not be left alone in a furnished room. Her wedding was celebrated with great festivities in Stockholm.

They had two sons:
* Prince George Valdemar Carl Axel of Denmark (16 April 1920 – 20 September 1986); married Anne Bowes-Lyon, niece of Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom (née Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon), on 16 September 1950. 
* Prince Flemming Valdemar Carl Axel (9 March 1922 – 19 June 2002); married Alice Ruth Nielson, daughter of Kai Nielson and Edith Fischer, on 24 May 1949. They have four children, ten grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

She was a maternal aunt of King Harald V of Norway and Kings Baudouin and Albert II of Belgium; and grandaunt of King Philippe of Belgium and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.

== Activities ==
Margaretha adjusted herself well in Denmark, which she had often visited on family occasions during her upbringing. She lived a private life devoted to her family on the estate Bernstorffshøj in Gentofte and generally avoided publicity, and kept in close contact with her relations abroad. She was interested in social issues in Sweden, and became the patron of several charity organisations in Denmark, and was the chairperson of Gentofte Børnevenner.

She was a leading guest at the 1947 wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

After the death of her sister Queen Astrid of Belgium in 1935, she became a great support for her sister&#x27;s young children in Belgium. After the death of her other sister, the Norwegian Crown Princess Märtha in 1954, she also became a great support for her sister&#x27;s children in Norway. She was the godmother of Astrid&#x27;s grandchildren, the twins Prince Jean of Luxembourg and Princess Margaretha of Liechtenstein, as well as Märtha&#x27;s daughter Princess Ragnhild, and granddaughter, princess Märtha Louise of Norway.

Her spouse died in 1964. As a widow, she was often back in Sweden, where she would join other members of the Swedish royal house in representative duties at official ceremonies — most notably, the Nobel Prize. To her family, she was affectionately known as &quot;Tante Ta&quot; (&quot;Aunt Ta&quot;).

She died in Kongsted, near Fakse, Denmark, in 1977.

<doc id="441039" wikidata="Q365409" url="?curid=441039" title="Francisco León de la Barra">
<text>Francisco León de la Barra y Quijano (16 June 1863 – 23 September 1939) was a Mexican political figure and diplomat who served as the 36th President of Mexico from May 25 to November 6, 1911 during the Mexican Revolution, following the resignations of President Porfirio Díaz and Vice President Ramón Corral. He previously served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs for one month during the Díaz administration and again from 1913 to 1914 under President Victoriano Huerta. He was known to conservatives as &quot;The White President&quot; or the &quot;Pure President&quot;.

==Early career==
León de la Barra&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Juan Francisco León de la Barra, was an Argentine-born fighter in the Chilean War of Independence under Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins. Upon returning to Argentina, Juan Francisco had seventeen children, including Bernabé León de la Barra, Francisco León de la Barra&#x27;s father. Bernabé later immigrated to Mexico, and supported President Benito Juárez and the Liberals during the second French intervention in Mexico. Bernabé married María Luisa Quijano, the daughter of General Alejandro Quijano of Yucatán, under whom he served. Bernabé and María Luisa&#x27;s son Francisco León de la Barra y Quijano was born in Querétaro City, Querétaro.

León de la Barra obtained a degree in law in Querétaro before entering politics as a federal deputy in 1891. In 1892, he attended the Ibero-American Judicial Conference held in Madrid on the occasion of the four hundredth anniversary of Columbus&#x27; discovery of America.

In 1896, León de la Barra entered the Mexican diplomatic corps, serving as envoy to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States (1909–11). He was Mexico&#x27;s representative at The Hague peace conference in 1907. During this time, he earned a reputation as an authority on international law. When the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, he was Ambassador to the U.S. Following the fraudulent elections of 1910, revolutionary forces rose up against Porfirio Díaz (r. 1876–80; 1884–1911), defeating the Federal Army and forcing his resignation as President. In the 21 May 1911 Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, León de la Barra was selected to be interim president, until elections could be held in the autumn of 1911. He was not a politician or a member of Díaz&#x27;s &quot;Científicos&quot;, but rather a diplomat and lawyer.

==President of Mexico==


He served as president until November 6, 1911, when Madero took office 6 November 1911 as the duly-elected president. Although considered by conservatives the benign &quot;White President,&quot; the German ambassador to Mexico, Paul von Hintze, who associated with the Interim President, said of him that &quot;De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party...&quot;

There were pressures for León de la Barra to run for the presidency himself, but he resisted. He did promote democracy and the elections that brought Madero to the presidency were considered free and fair. There was a controversy during the summer of 1911 when fighting broke out in the streets of Puebla between federal soldiers and irregulars who supported Madero. President León de la Barra blamed his Minister of the Interior, Emilio Vázquez Gómez, the brother of Madero&#x27;s vice presidential running mate, Francisco Vázquez Gómez for the violence and its mishandling. Madero replaced his running mate with José María Pino Suárez.
In his inauguration address to the nation, León de la Barra had three stated goals: the restoration of order, bringing about free and fair elections, and the continuation of reforms promised at the end of the Díaz presidency. Since Madero had called on his revolutionary followers to lay down their arms, despite their having brought about conditions forcing Díaz&#x27;s resignation, there was continuing turmoil in areas where they had mobilized. He sought to disarm the irregular forces, remove them from the army payroll, and send them home. In Morelos, Emiliano Zapata and his followers resisted demobilization, and León de la Barra sent troops under General Victoriano Huerta to put down the rebellion. Huerta failed to do that, but did wreak havoc in Morelos, burning villages and attacking the local population. Rebellions in other parts of the country, in Baja California, Oaxaca, and Chiapas were successfully repressed.

During his presidency, he did implement some reforms, including improved funding for rural schools; promoting some aspects of agrarian reform to increase the amount of productive land; labor reforms including workman&#x27;s compensation and the eight-hour day; but also the right of the government to intervene in strikes. According to historian Peter V.N. Henderson, León de la Barra&#x27;s and congress&#x27;s actions &quot;suggests that few Porfirians wished to return to the status quo of the dictatorship. Rather, the thoughtful, progressive members of the Porfirian meritocracy recognized the need for change.&quot;

==Subsequent career==
León de la Barra ran for the Mexican Congress in 1912 and was elected a senator, aligned with the Científicos and the National Catholic Party. León de la Barra colluded with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Henry Lane Wilson to oust Madero from the presidency. During the Ten Tragic Days of February 1913, Madero resigned and was then assassinated. 
During the regime of Victoriano Huerta he served briefly as Foreign Minister and then was appointed ambassador to France (1913–14). He retired to Europe and became president of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, located in The Hague. He participated in various international commissions after World War I and wrote many works on judicial and administrative affairs.

In early 1939, León de la Barra was used by the French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet as an unofficial diplomat to begin talks with General Francisco Franco for French recognition of the Spanish Nationalists as the legitimate government of Spain. The Spanish Nationalists overthrew the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War, allying with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. As a result of the talks León de la Barra began, France recognized the Spanish Nationalists in February 1939.

Anyone associated with the Huerta regime has been tainted in modern Mexican history by the association, including Francisco León de la Barra.

==Personal life and death==

León de la Barra married María Elena Borneque, a French Mexican woman. They had two sons, Francisco and Julio, neither of whom survived to adulthood. Borneque died in 1909, and after a mourning period, León de la Barra married her sister, María del Refugio Borneque.

León de la Barra&#x27;s son-in-law, Alfonso Alemán, joined Francisco Franco&#x27;s nationalist FET y de las JONS faction against the republican Spanish Armed Forces in the Spanish Civil War.

He died in Biarritz in September 1939, without ever returning to Mexico.

<doc id="441040" wikidata="Q762267" url="?curid=441040" title="Próspero Fernández Oreamuno">
<text>Juan Primitivo Próspero Fernández Oreamuno (July 18, 1834 – March 12, 1885) was President of Costa Rica from 1882 to 1885.

Fernández studied philosophy at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala before embarking on a military career. He fought in the war of 1856–1857 against William Walker and participated in the military coup that overthrew Jesús Jiménez in 1870. He was married to a sister of Tomás Guardia and under Guardia&#x27;s government he was appointed commander of the Alajuela barracks and given the rank of Major General.

He was elected to succeed Guardia in 1882. As president he implemented measures that sought to undermine the power of the Roman Catholic Church. He withdrew the Concordat with the Holy See, expelled both the Jesuits and the bishop of Costa Rica from the country, and in 1884 passed laws that placed cemeteries under state control, introduced civil marriage, and legalized divorce. The most powerful figure within his government was his brother-in-law, former president José María Castro Madriz, who served as minister of foreign and religious affairs, education, justice, and public aid.

During his administration the state defaulted on its financial obligations to Minor C. Keith, who was building a railway to the Caribbean port of Limón. To compensate him, cabinet minister Bernardo Soto signed a deal that gave Keith 800,000 acres (3,200 km2) of tax-free land along the railroad, plus a 99-year lease on the operation of the train route. Keith would later use those lands and his command of the railroad to build a powerful banana trading concern (see United Fruit Company).

President Fernández died in office shortly after declaring war on Guatemala which, under Gen. Justo Rufino Barrios, had embarked on the reunification of the dissolved United Provinces of Central America.

National Highway CR-27 connecting the capital city of San José with the Pacific coast&#x27;s port of Caldera is named in his honor.

<text>The rondelet is a brief French form of poetry. It contains a single septet, refrain, a strict rhyme scheme and a distinct meter pattern.

Rondelet is the diminutive of rondel, a similar, longer verse form. This is the basic structure:

* Line 1: A—four syllables
* Line 2: b—eight syllables
* Line 3: A—repeat of line one
* Line 4: a—eight syllables
* Line 5: b—eight syllables
* Line 6: b—eight syllables
* Line 7: A—repeat of line one

The refrained lines should contain the same words, however substitution or different use of punctuation on the lines has been common.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;roundelay&quot; originates from 1570, from Modern French rondelet, a diminutive of rondel meaning &quot;short poem with a refrain,&quot; literally &quot;small circle&quot;. From Old French rondel, a diminutive of rond meaning &quot;circle, sphere,&quot; originally an adjective from roont. The spelling developed by association with lay (noun) &quot;poem to be sung.&quot; 

A Roundelay can be any simple lyric with a refrain, but in prosody, a roundelay is a 24-line poem with a refrain and regularly repeating rhyme structure.

<text>Earl of Sutherland is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created circa 1230 for William de Moravia and is the premier earldom in the Peerage of Scotland. The earl or countess of Sutherland is also the chief of Clan Sutherland.

==History==
The original line of earls of Sutherland had the surname &quot;de Moravia&quot; although they sometimes used the surname &quot;Sutherland&quot;, taken from their hereditary title. The name de Moravia meant &quot;of Moray&quot; or &quot;of Murray&quot;. The de Moravias who were earls of Sutherland and chiefs of Clan Sutherland, arguably shared their early paternal ancestry with the chiefs of Clan Murray through their shared progenitor Freskin de Moravia. Various branches of the Murray Clan claim descent from Freskin, including those who were earls and later dukes of Atholl. Current research is underway via male-line Y-DNA studies in collaboration with both branches of these clans to determine if any modern branches share an early medieval ancestor. From Robert, 6th Earl (d. 1444) onward the surname Sutherland was used.

Elizabeth Sutherland, 10th Countess of Sutherland (1470–1535) married Adam Gordon, a younger son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, chief of Clan Gordon. Their first son is Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland, whose descendants were several of the next earls of Sutherland, who all used the surname Gordon. The title was again held by a long string of men, until the death of William Gordon, 18th earl, without sons, when the title passed to his daughter Elizabeth, 19th Countess of Sutherland (1765–1839).

The 19th Countess of Sutherland then married George Granville Leveson-Gower in 1785; he inherited the title of Marquess of Stafford from his father in 1803. The marquess held vast lands and wealth, having inherited from his father, the first marquess of Stafford, from his maternal uncle, the second duke of Bridgewater, and also holding much property associated with the Earldom of Sutherland, which belonged to his wife. He was made Duke of Sutherland in 1833.

The duke&#x27;s son, also named George, inherited the Earldom of Sutherland from his mother and the Dukedom of Sutherland from his father. The two titles continued united in the Leveson-Gower family until the death of the fifth duke in 1963. The earldom passed to his niece Elizabeth, 24th Countess of Sutherland (1921–2019), while the dukedom had to pass to a male heir and was inherited by John Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere (1915–2000).

The subsidiary title associated with the earldom is Lord Strathnaver (created 1230), which is used as a courtesy title by the earl&#x27;s or countess&#x27;s eldest son and heir. (There is no evidence of Sutherland use of this title from 1230 although later on the Gordons adopted it, but it was never formally approved by king or government. The title is disputed by Clan Mackay whose early chiefs are all titled &quot;of Strathnaver&quot; from Iye MacAiodh 1st of Strathnaver (b. about 1210) to at least Sir Donald Mackay who was created as the first Lord Reay in 1628. There is independent evidence of the recognition of this title in reference to &quot;the noble Angus Aodh of Strathnaver&quot; in a charter to Angus by the Lord of the Isles in 1415, in a 1504 &#x27;Gift of Non-entry&#x27; by James IV: &quot;our lovit Y Mcky in Strathnaver&quot;. The title is also implicit in the 1517 bond of friendship between Adam Gordon and Aodh Mackay and then his son John&#x27;s 1518 renewed bond that refers to John Mackay as &quot;of Strathnaver&quot;. Other confirmations are from 1540 in a charter from the Bishop of Caithness : &quot;Donald Mackay of Strathnaver&quot;, a 1623 Privy Council commission: &quot;Sir Donald Mackay of Strathnaver&quot;.)

The family seat is Dunrobin Castle, near Golspie, Sutherland in Scotland.

==Ancestors of the earls of Sutherland==

Different sources give different accounts of the ancestors of the earls of Sutherland. The generally accepted ancestry is that William de Moravia (William Sutherland), 1st Earl of Sutherland in the peerage of Scotland (died 1248) was the son of Hugh de Moravia, who in turn was a grandson of Freskin, a Flemish knight. William Fraser, writing in the 19th century gives a similar account but states that Hugh was actually the son of Freskin, rather than his grandson. Sir Robert Gordon (1580–1656), the 17th century historian of the House of Sutherland, and a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, stated that William de Moravia (William Sutherland), 1st Earl of Sutherland (died 1248) was the son of Hugh, Earl of Sutherland who was nicknamed &quot;Hugh Freskin&quot;, who was in turn son of Robert Sutherland (Earl of Sutherland and founder of Dunrobin Castle), who was son of Walter Southerland (Earl of Sutherland), who was son of Alane Southerland, Thane of Sutherland.

==Earls of Sutherland==

<text>The rove beetles are a family (Staphylinidae) of beetles, primarily distinguished by their short elytra (wing covers) that typically leave more than half of their abdominal segments exposed. With over 66,000 species in thousands of genera, the group is one of the largest families in the beetle order, and one of the largest families of organisms. It is an ancient group that first appeared during the Middle Jurassic based on definitive records of fossilized rove beetles, with the Late Triassic taxon &quot;Leehermania&quot; more likely belonging to Myxophaga. They are an ecologically and morphologically diverse group of beetles, and commonly encountered in terrestrial ecosystems.

One well-known species is the devil&#x27;s coach-horse beetle (&quot;Ocypus olens&quot;). For some other species, see list of British rove beetles.

==Anatomy==
As might be expected for such a large family, considerable variation exists among the species. Sizes range from &lt;1 to , with most in the 2–8 mm range, and the form is generally elongated, with some rove beetles being ovoid in shape. Colors range from yellow and red to reddish-brown to brown to black to iridescent blue and green. The antennae usually have 11 segments and are , with moderate clubbing in some genera. The abdomen may be very long and flexible, and some rove beetles superficially resemble earwigs. In the genera Paederinae, Euaesthetinae, and Osoriinae, and partially in Steninae, the tergum and sternum on the visible abdominal segments have fused, making each segment ring-shaped.

Due to the small elytra these beetles have to fold their wings into a sort of origami shape. They are nevertheless good at flying.
Some rove beetles, including members of &quot;Antimerus&quot; and &quot;Phanolinus&quot;, are metallic in appearance.

Some members of Paederina (specifically the genus &quot;Paederus&quot;), a subtribe of Paederinae, contain a potent vesicant in their haemolymph that can produce a skin irritation called dermatitis linearis, also known as &quot;Paederus&quot; dermatitis. The irritant pederin is highly toxic, more potent than cobra venom.

==Ecology==
Rove beetles are known from every type of habitat in which beetles occur, and their diets include just about everything except the living tissues of higher plants, but now including higher plants with the discovery of the diet of &quot;Himalusa thailandensis&quot;. Most rove beetles are predators of insects and other invertebrates, living in forest leaf litter and similar decaying plant matter. They are also commonly found under stones, and around freshwater margins. 
Almost 400 species are known to live on ocean shores that are submerged at high tide, including the pictured rove beetle, although these are much fewer than 1% of the worldwide total of Staphylinidae. Other species have adapted to live as inquilines in ant and termite colonies, and some live in mutualistic relationships with mammals whereby they eat fleas and other parasites, benefiting the host. A few species, notably those of the genus &quot;Aleochara&quot;, are scavengers and carrion feeders, or are parasitoids of other insects, particularly of certain fly pupae. To profit from the alleged advantages, several Staphylinidae have been transferred into Italy, Hawaii, the continental United States and Easter Island by practitioners. Another advantage of rove beetles is their sensitivity to changes in the environment, such as habitat alteration. This means they have potential as an ecological disturbance indicator in human-dominated environments. 

Although rove beetles&#x27; appetites for other insects would seem to make them obvious candidates for biological control of pests, and empirically they are believed to be important controls in the wild, experiments using them have not been notably successful. Greater success is seen with those species that are parasitoids (genus &quot;Aleochara&quot;).

Rove beetles of the genus &quot;Stenus&quot; are specialist predators of small invertebrates such as springtails (Collembola). Their labium can shoot out from the head using blood pressure. The thin rod of the labium ends in a pad of bristly hairs and hooks and between these hairs are small pores that exude an adhesive glue-like substance, which sticks to prey.
==Systematics==
Classification of the 63,650 (as of 2018) staphylinid species is ongoing and controversial, with some workers proposing an organization of as many as 10 separate families, but the current favored system is one of 32 subfamilies, about 167 tribes (some grouped into supertribes), and about 3,200 genera. About 400 new species are being described each year, and some estimates suggest three-quarters of tropical species are as yet undescribed.

<text>General Tomás Miguel Guardia Gutiérrez (December 16, 1831 – July 6, 1882) was President of Costa Rica on two occasions: from 1870 to 1876, and from 1877 to 1882.

On 27 April 1870 Tomás Guardia was one of a group of army officers who deposed President Jesús Jiménez. He was the power behind the throne during the very short presidency of his conspirator Bruno Carranza, whom he replaced after a period of three months.

The following year he enacted Costa Rica&#x27;s 1871 Constitution, which remained in force until 1948.

On 8 May 1876 he surrendered the presidency to Aniceto Esquivel. He continued to pull the strings of power during Esquivel&#x27;s short term in office and that of Esquivel&#x27;s successor Vicente Herrera, before reassuming the presidency himself on 11 September 1877. He abolished the death penalty later that year.

He remained in office until his death.

<text>James George Thirlwell (born 29 January 1960), styled as JG Thirlwell and also known as Clint Ruin, Frank Want, and [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]], among other pseudonyms, is an Australian musician, composer, and record producer known for juxtaposing a variety of different musical styles.

==Life and career==

Thirlwell was born in Melbourne, Australia. He briefly studied fine art at Melbourne State College (now part of the University of Melbourne) before moving in 1978 to London, England, where he played with the post-punk band prag VEC and formed the first of his numerous musical projects, Foetus. In the 1980s, under the pseudonyms Clint Ruin and Frank Want, he contributed to various releases by Nurse With Wound, Marc Almond, The The and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He co-wrote &quot;Wings Off Flies&quot; on &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;, the first Bad Seeds album. Longtime Nick Cave associate Mick Harvey would later report that Thirlwell&#x27;s time in the band was cut short, in part, by a clash between Thirlwell&#x27;s highly structured studio routine as contrasted with Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27; then habit of &quot;shambling through it&quot; while recording.

Thirlwell released his first 7-inch single, &quot;OKFM/Spite Your Face&quot;, in 1981, on his own Self-Immolation record label in his first incarnation as Foetus. Over the next few years he would release two more singles, a 12&quot; EP, and four full-length albums, &quot;Deaf&quot;, &quot;Ache&quot;, &quot;Hole&quot; and &quot;Nail&quot; (Some Bizzare Records). After visiting the United States during a live stint with the Immaculate Consumptive (Lydia Lunch, Nick Cave and Marc Almond) Thirlwell settled in New York City, where he is still based. Since his move he has released several singles, fourteen EPs (including &quot;Stinkfist&quot;, with fellow New York artist Lydia Lunch), and seventeen full-length albums.

In addition to being a prolific artist in his own right, Thirlwell has remixed and produced numerous pieces for artists including Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, Pantera, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, The The, Zola Jesus, Front 242, and Swans. He has also done voice-over work for MTV and other entities.

Since 2000, Thirlwell has become more active as a composer, having written commissions for Bang on a Can, League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots, and the Kronos Quartet, and scoring cartoons &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; for Adult Swim and &quot;Archer&quot; for FX. His most recent project was scoring the John Hodgman and David Rees cartoon detective show &quot;Dicktown&quot;.

He also revived his primary instrumental project, Steroid Maximus, and initiated a more experimental instrumental project in Manorexia. He continues to write and perform regularly as a solo artist and with various ensembles. He is also a member of the freq_out sound art collective, and has created solo sound installations in Kaliningrad, Santarcangelo and Vienna.

===Music===

Thirlwell&#x27;s music—released under his various project names of Foetus, Wiseblood, Steroid Maximus, Baby Zizanie, Manorexia and others—includes elements of 20th-century classical music, noise, big band, Americana, jazz, punk rock, African and Cuban percussion, and epic/horror film soundtracks. Much of Thirlwell&#x27;s aural output is built on a percussive, rock music-type structure, though to call it rock music would be inaccurate. His music employs elements of many genres: with an often frenzied aesthetic, Thirlwell&#x27;s music combines percussion, strings, distortion, brass, electric guitars, electronic sounds and voice. Recurring lyrical themes include destruction, persecution, anxiety, abuse, incest, masochism, angst, self-destruction, self-abuse, lust, prejudice, murder, failure and machismo, often expressed using American colloquialism and black humour.

===Musical projects===

*Foetus: Thirlwell&#x27;s main project. From 1981&#x27;s single &quot;OKFM&quot; until 2013&#x27;s &quot;Soak&quot;, most Foetus songs featured lead vocals. Though popularly known as simply &quot;Foetus&quot;, Thirlwell released albums under diverse variations of the name, including: Foetus Art Terrorism; Foetus Über Frisco; Foetus Corruptus; Foetus In Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe; Foetus Inc.; Foetus Interruptus; Foetus Over Frisco; Foetus Under Glass; Philip and His Foetus Vibrations; Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel; The Foetus All-Nude Revue; The Foetus of Excellence; The Foetus Symphony Orchestra; and You&#x27;ve Got Foetus On Your Breath.
*Steroid Maximus: Primary instrumental project. Collaboration with Raymond Watts.
*Manorexia: Experimental instrumental project.
*Wiseblood: Collaboration with Roli Mosimann.
*Flesh Volcano: Collaboration with Marc Almond.
*Baby Zizanie: Collaboration with Jim Coleman.
*Hydroze Plus: Collaboration with Electronicat.
*Garage Monsters: Collaboration with skater artist the P!zz. (Sympathy for the Record Industry)
*The Immaculate Consumptive: Touring ensemble with Lydia Lunch, Nick Cave, and Marc Almond
*&quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;: Musical score by Thirlwell.
*&quot;Archer&quot;: Musical score by Thirlwell from Season 7 onwards.
*Xordox: Thirlwell&#x27;s new instrumental project.
*&quot;Dicktown&quot;: Musical score by Thirlwell. 2020 animated show with David Rees and John Hodgman

==Aliases==
Throughout the span of his career, Thirlwell has toyed with his own identity by releasing music in the guise of numerous alter egos. During the earliest phases of his recording, Thirlwell&#x27;s &quot;groups&quot; were composed of a plethora of fictional characters: Foetus Under Glass supposedly consisted of Frank Want, Phillip Toss and two Brazilian statistics collectors; Scraping Foetus off the Wheel was claimed to be the work of Want and Clint Ruin. Furthering the confusion, Thirlwell adopted these personas outside of his own recordings; for example, Frank Want can be found on The The&#x27;s &quot;Soul Mining&quot; and on releases by Orange Juice, with whom he appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

The persona of Clint Ruin was particularly notable in this context; during the mid-1980s and early 1990s Thirlwell exclusively went by this pseudonym, even conducting interviews as Ruin. As Ruin, Thirlwell was a member of Wiseblood with Roli Mosimann and Flesh Volcano with Marc Almond. He also recorded two collaborative EPs with Lydia Lunch, and starred in and scored films by Richard Kern under the Ruin alias. Ruin is also credited on numerous releases for a variety of roles with Boss Hog, Coil, Fur Bible, Annie Hogan, Nurse With Wound, Pigface, Sonic Youth, Workdogs and others.

This practice seems to have been discontinued since 1995, and &quot;JG Thirlwell&quot; is credited on all subsequent musical recordings.

<text>Jewel and Esk College was a further education college in the Lothians in Scotland. It had two campuses, one located at Milton Road in Edinburgh and the other at Eskbank, Dalkeith, Midlothian.

In October 2012 the college merged with Edinburgh&#x27;s other two FE colleges (Telford College and Stevenson College) to form a new entity called Edinburgh College. Jewel and Esk&#x27;s campuses now form two of the four main sites of the new college.

==Students ==

The college catered for 7,000 students on a full/part-time and Open learning basis.

In 2006, Jewel &amp; Esk College had nearly 8,000 students.

== History ==

Jewel and Esk Valley College was founded in 1903. Jewell and Esk Valley College was created in 1987 from the merger of Leith Nautical College (a former Central Institution) and Esk Valley College. The Jewel part of the name refers to a former coal-mining area in the college&#x27;s catchment area.

== Campuses ==

The college campuses were remodelled between 2005 and 2008. In Dalkeith a new build replaced an older building (now demolished) across the road from the current site. 
The buildings and facilities at both locations are innovative and intended to introduce educational qualifications and skills.

Natural light flows through many of the spaces, highlighting the dynamic nature of the buildings and showcasing key areas of the college. In 2011, Jewel and Esk College had plans to install solar panels to generate electricity and to reduce their reliability on government funding.

==Midlothian Campus==

At Hardengreen, the new Midlothian Campus opened to students in 2008 as one of the most advanced technology teaching centres in Scotland, featuring an Oil Production Platform Simulator, specialist engineering and construction equipment, along with purpose-built plumbing and electrical workshops.

<doc id="441062" wikidata="Q1764288" url="?curid=441062" title="Optigan">
<text>The Optigan (a portmanteau of &quot;optical organ&quot;) is an electronic keyboard instrument designed for the consumer market. The name stems from the instrument&#x27;s reliance on pre-recorded optical soundtracks to reproduce sound. Later versions (built under license and aimed at the professional market) were sold under the name Orchestron.

==Production history==
Engineering work on the project began in 1968 and the first patents issued in 1970. The Optigan was released in 1971 by Optigan Corporation, a subsidiary of toy manufacturer Mattel, Incorporated of El Segundo, California with the manufacturing plant located nearby in Compton, California. At least one TV commercial from the era is extant, featuring the Optigan demonstrated by actor Carl Betz (best known for his role as the father on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;). The Optigan was promoted in at least one Sears-Roebuck catalog. All rights to the Optigan, the disc format, and all previous discs were sold in 1973 to Miner Industries of New York City, an organ manufacturer who formed a subsidiary, Opsonar, to produce it. Miner had record sales for a time, in part due to Opsonar. However, sales declined shortly thereafter and production of the Optigan and its discs ceased in 1976.

==Appearance and construction==

The Optigan looked like a scaled-down version of the electronic organs of the day. The various cabinet designs and their matching benches were simulated wood made out of a molded plastic the manufacturer dubbed &quot;Temperite&quot; and finished with matching speaker grille cloth and occasionally reverb units inside the unit. A mechanical reverb unit and cabinetry with genuine wood veneer were available as extra-cost options; the control for the reverb on units so equipped is located below the power switch. Non-reverb equipped Optigans feature a metal plate which reads &quot;Stereophonic&quot; in raised relief and which hides the unused opening. Reverb-equipped units had a slightly different plate which read &quot;REVERB Stereophonic&quot; affixed immediately to the left of the rocker switches and above the power switch. According to optigan.com, two piano bar prototypes were produced. The Optigan played in stereo through two solid state amplifiers with the right-hand keyboard assigned to the instrument&#x27;s right channel and the chords and effects assigned to the left.

==The optical disc format==

The Optigan&#x27;s playback system functioned much like the storage and reading of an optical soundtrack as was used in motion pictures, using a light bulb to energize a row of photodiodes on the opposite side of spinning, 12&quot; diameter clear plastic film discs (officially referred to as &quot;Program Discs&quot;) encoded with fifty-seven concentric optical tracks. The system then translated the analog waveforms on the disc to an audio signal. A flip-down door beneath the keyboard allowed access to the disc&#x27;s loading area to the left of the unit and a disc storage area to the right. Program discs were loaded by simply sliding them onto the felt-covered platform; a V-shaped notch on the front of the panel aided in alignment. When power was applied and the front cover closed, a spindle engaged the center hole of the disc and a motor-driven idler wheel spun the disc on the spindle. The power switch itself was mechanically linked to the disc&#x27;s drive system; lowering the front panel dropped the spindle and disconnected power to the instrument, allowing the program discs to be changed without the need to fully power down. A broad, flat, white plastic cleaning tool with a purple, simulated velvet cleaning surface was supplied with each Optigan to allow periodic cleaning of the photoelectric cell, located near the rear of the instrument.

Thirty-seven tracks were sustained or repeatedly percussive notes in the timbre of a particular instrument and were played through a standard three-octave piano-style keyboard with the right hand; twenty-one were of a live band or soloist playing chords in different keys arranged per the circle of fifths, specifically B-flat, F, C, G, D, A and E major, minor, and diminished and were played with the left hand in much the style of a chord organ or accordion. The remaining five were assigned to rocker switches above the chord buttons and featured (depending on the disc in question) percussion, sound effects, introductions, vamps, and endings synchronized with the chord buttons. Pushing upward on the rocker switches locked them in place for use with percussion; pushing downward allowed momentary use for vamps, introductions and endings.

Not all of the chord buttons had their own track assignments, the result being only fifty-seven sounds on sixty-three buttons, keys and switches. There was also an optical metronome incorporated into the discs which showed as a red flashing light for the downbeat and white for the upbeats inside the Optigan badge above the keyboard. The advantages of this unique optical playback system were that the Optigan&#x27;s range of timbres was infinitely expandable and that there was no limit on the duration of a note as there was on the Optigan&#x27;s professional-grade counterpart, the magnetic tape-based Chamberlin or its successor the Mellotron. The disadvantage was that notes could have neither attack nor decay, as the tracks had no specific beginning or end.

The &quot;Starter Set&quot; sold with the Optigan contained discs with fairly self-explanatory titles: &quot;Big Organ &amp; Drums&quot;, &quot;Pop Piano Plus Guitar&quot;, &quot;Latin Fever&quot;, and &quot;Guitar in 3/4 Time&quot;. More modern styles were represented by titles such as &quot;Movin&#x27;!&quot;, which was a rhythm and blues disc and &quot;Hear and Now&quot;, with a sound clearly based on the hit single &quot;Sweet Seasons&quot; by Carole King (and cover art evocative of that of her &quot;Tapestry&quot; (1971) album). Other discs were marketed individually and packaged much like long-playing phonograph records. These individual titles were also bundled in much the same way as the &quot;Starter Set&quot; and sold as six-disc &quot;Entertainment Folios&quot;. Some discs were available only as part of a two-disc &quot;Style Pak&quot; with titles such as &quot;The Joyous Sounds of Christmas&quot;, &quot;Country Style Pak.&quot;, &quot;Polka&quot; and &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; - these last two being produced towards the end of production and in very low quantities. Music books of various styles and even arrangements intended for individual disks were also available and sometimes packaged with the different bundles.

The initial run of musical tracks were recorded by Southern California studio musicians in Hollywood and Torrance. However, a musicians&#x27; union strike meant that some of the later discs were recorded in Germany. One disc is of particular note. The instrumental tracks for &quot;Bluegrass Banjo&quot; were recorded by members of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The Vox Humana disc keyboard sound was used for the &quot;Vocal Choir&quot; Orchestron disc.

For the benefit of those unable to read music, the notes in the books were numbered in correspondence to a numbered and color-coded foil strip above the keyboard. The Optigan&#x27;s songbooks were written and arranged by Optigan Corporation&#x27;s music director, Johnny Largo. Largo, an accordionist and session musician, was a contemporary of Johnny Marks, a composer best known for his popular mid-20th century Christmas melodies. As such, many of the songs in the Christmas books were Marks compositions.

==Problems==

Despite its use of recordings of actual musical instruments instead of internally generated sounds, the Optigan suffered from poor tonal quality due not only to the bandwidth limitations of its optical system, but its mechanical system as well. The Optigan concept was similar to that of the Mellotron (early sampling technology), but while the Mellotron used magnetic tape, the Optigan borrowed its technology from motion-picture optical soundtrack technology and its amplitude-modulated format.

The disc could be sped up or slowed down using a thumbwheel next to the chord buttons to cause a corresponding change in tempo and pitch; however, higher speeds tended to roll-off the lower frequencies, lower speeds rolled off the highs, and moderate to slow tempo lent a slightly muddy quality overall. Natural imperfections on the acetate discs, as well as dust and dirt, came through as scratches, clicks and pops, much like a worn phonograph record. Furthermore, the pitch change brought on by the tempo adjustment made session work with live musicians a difficult proposition, especially since the pitch varied greatly from disc to disc.

Even though the technology of the day was more than sophisticated enough to avoid them, there were numerous mechanical problems with the disc&#x27;s motor drive due to its having been engineered to be as affordable as possible. Changes in environment, which had a physical effect on the photocells, frequently led to crosstalk between tracks. One common example involves the F at the upper end of the keyboard: press this key, step on the volume control pedal, and the C-diminished/A-diminished chord can often be heard in the background.

These same diminished chords intentionally found their way onto the row of major chords. And as pointed out earlier in this article, not all of the chord buttons had their own track assignments. In a very unusual move, A-major utilizes the same soundtrack as B-flat-diminished, G-diminished, and E-diminished, while E-major shares space with F-diminished and D-diminished, thereby making it impossible to play in the keys of A or E, at least with left-hand accompaniment. Apparently, this was done to save space on the disc, further explaining the lack of dominant seventh chords or any chords in the keys of E-flat, A-flat, D-flat, B and F-sharp.

Since the instrument was aimed at amateur players, the majority of the songs in the Optigan&#x27;s music books are written in the much simpler keys of F, C and G.

==Vako Orchestron==

Vako Synthesizers Incorporated, founded by electronic instrument pioneer David Van Koevering, and who built licensed versions of the Optigan under the name Orchestron in the mid-1970s. Intended for professional use as an alternative to the Mellotron, the Orchestron featured improved recorded sounds over the Optigan. Some models included sequencers and synthesizers. While the same fidelity limitations of the Optigan applied to the Orchestron, these instruments were built to be more reliable and were used successfully in commercial recordings.

==Use in the music industry==

Regardless of its limitations and its problems with pitch, many notable musicians have used the Optigan or, more likely, samples of the instrument if the recordings are made after the year 2000. Among them: Trace, I Dont Know How But They Found Me, Steve Hackett, Third Eye Blind, The Clash, Elvis Costello, Jon Brion, Driefzand, NL, in single &quot;Zunlicht&quot;, Blur, Marco Benevento, Fiona Apple, Crash Test Dummies, Kraftwerk (Orchestron), Coil, Money Mark, Ani DiFranco, Michael Penn, Steve Fisk, Tom Waits, Marilyn Manson, Nan Vernon, Hala Strana, TISM, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, The Real Tuesday Weld, King Princess, Them Crooked Vultures, C418, Unwound, Sparklehorse and Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo—who mixed in parts of the &quot;Banjo Sing-Along&quot; disc on a later remix of Devo&#x27;s 1981 single, &quot;Beautiful World&quot;.

The earliest recording that used an Optigan was on an album by electronic music pioneer Bruce Haack. On his 1973 release &quot;Captain Entropy&quot;, Haack made extensive use of the Optigan, utilizing several Optigan disks such as &quot;Nashville Country&quot; for the track &quot;Army Ants&quot; and &quot;Singing Rhythm&quot; for the track &quot;Walking Eagle&quot;. The album was recorded in his bedroom studio and released on his own Dimension 5 Records, a label releasing children&#x27;s records from 1962 through 1977.

Another early recording that used the Optigan was an album by European dance music pioneer Alan Steward. On his 1976 live album release &quot;Just Listen&quot;, Alan made extensive use of the Optigan. Six out of the nine tracks on the album including the title track &quot;Just Listen&quot; feature the Optigan. Alan also made extensive use of the &quot;breakbeats&quot; and the samples of the Hammond B3 organ that were part of the backing tracks found on many of the soul and R&amp;B oriented Optigan discs. The European distributor of the Optigan used Alan Steward&#x27;s album for promotion and in-store demos.

Steve Hackett has also made frequent use of the Optigan. Hackett&#x27;s 1980 album, &quot;Defector&quot;, features an unusual number called &quot;Sentimental Institution&quot;, recorded with a solo Optigan spinning the &quot;Big Band Beat&quot; disc behind singer Peter Hicks&#x27; vocals. Hackett made use of all five of that disc&#x27;s vamps and its ending; that particular disc featured no percussion tracks. On his &quot;Live Archive: 70s&quot; (2001), featuring a performance from 1979, he plays a surrealistically silly interlude on the instrument (introducing it as &quot;the most tasteless thing I could possibly do&quot;). His 2003 release, &quot;To Watch the Storms&quot;, features sonically expanded samples of the Opsonar &quot;Champagne Music&quot; disc on the track, &quot;Circus of Becoming&quot;.

Film director and sound designer David Lynch sampled &quot;Big Band Beat&quot; as part of his soundscape &quot;The Air is On Fire&quot;, produced as ambience for a 2007 art exhibition. He then reused the song, redubbed &quot;Slow 30s Room&quot;, in the 
eighth episode of television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;″ third season, broadcast in June 2017.

<doc id="441067" wikidata="Q569394" url="?curid=441067" title="2003 Casablanca bombings">
<text>The 2003 Casablanca bombings, commonly known as May 16 (, ), were a series of coordinated suicide bombings on May 16, 2003, in Casablanca, Morocco. Twelve suicide bombers loyal to the Salafia Jihadia organization detonated bombs hidden in backpacks in the Casa de España restaurant, the , the Jewish Alliance of Casablanca, and sites near the Belgian consulate and an old Jewish cemetery. The attacks, which were later claimed by al-Qaeda, were the deadliest terrorist attacks in Morocco&#x27;s history, claiming the lives of forty-five people (33 victims and 12 suicide bombers) and injuring at least 100. Despite deliberately targeting Jews, none of the victims were Jews as the attack occurred during Shabbat.

Out of the initial commando of fifteen, three abandoned their plans on the spot and were later arrested. The attacks came in a rise in radical preachers critical of the Moroccan government, which they had viewed as infidels; many of the preachers were veterans of the Soviet-Afghan war.

The interrogation of the surviving suicide bombers led to the terrorist cell&#x27;s ringleader, Abdelhak Bentassir, who had demanded that members of the cell make an oath of allegiance towards him after following a radical preacher. Bentassir later died in police custody in unclear circumstances. Authorities led a judicial purge of Islamists in the country, with indictments filed against 2,112 extremists leading to 903 convictions and 12 death sentences.

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, a tough counter-terrorism bill was signed which was compared to the Patriot Act. The attacks shined light on the state of shantytowns in the country, with a government initiative fighting against slums being announced the following year. The slums of Sidi Moumen were fully demolished after a series of attacks in 2007.

== Background and planning ==
=== Radical Islam in Morocco ===
Throughout modern Moroccan history, radical Islamist violence has been relatively unprecedented. There have been rare exceptions such as the 1975 assassination of Omar Benjelloun by loyalists to Islamist guru Abdelkrim Motiî. Despite this, radical islamists were largely forced to be peaceful following the assassination due to crackdowns on groups such as Shabiba Islamiya under King Hassan II&#x27;s Years of Lead.

The Soviet-Afghan war provided an opportunity for radical islamists in Morocco to participate in what they perceived as holy war, with seventy Moroccans having fought for the Afghan Mujahideen according to the Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DST). This included future members of Salafia Jihadia.

In 1996 and amidst the Algerian civil war, Osama bin Laden tasked Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi to create a federation of jihadist movements loyal to al-Qaeda in the Maghreb which culminated in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). The group&#x27;s founding members were al-Libi&#x27;s lieutenants, which mainly consisted of Moroccan diaspora such as in the United Kingdom.

In a bid to expand to Morocco, the LIFG created the Moroccan Islamic Movement (HASM) and published two issues of a fanzine titled Sada al-Maghrib () which was distributed in Denmark, Italy, and Belgium. In 1997, the HASM turned into Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM) and published nine press releases in al-Ansar, the media branch of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA). A year later, al-Libi sent a Libyan representative to Morocco to see if Moroccan society was &quot;ready&quot;.

In 1994, four French citizens loyal to Shabiba Islamiya in Marrakesh, killing two Spanish tourists. Moroccan authorities blamed the attacks on the Algerian Department of Intelligence and Security (DRS), leading to Morocco closing its borders with Algeria. The mastermind of the attacks, Abdellilah Ziyad, was deported from France in 2021 and was arrested in Morocco.

In early 2001, after the representative&#x27;s departure, Osama bin Laden ordered al-Libi to transfer all remaining high-ranking Moroccan members of the LIFG to the GICM as the GICM was al-Qaeda&#x27;s official relay in Morocco. A training camp for the GICM was opened in Bagram as well as a guest house for GICM members in Kabul ran by Saâd Houssaïni. Following the Battle of Tora Bora in the immediate aftermath of September 11 attacks, most members of the GICM in Afghanistan returned to Morocco, including future radical preachers who would have an ideological impact on the Casablanca attackers. Members of the GICM who had returned from Afghanistan were dubbed as &quot;the Afghans&quot; by the DST.

In May 2002, the DST arrested three Saudi members of al-Qaeda, Zouhair Hilal Mohamed al-Tubaiti, Hilal Jaber Awad al-Assiri, and Abdullah Musafer Ali al-Ghamdi. They had planned to attack ships belonging to the British Naval in the strait of Gibraltar and had been in contact with Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the mastermind of the USS Cole bombing. They were sentenced to ten years in prison in February 2003.

=== Salafia Jihadia and as-Sirat al-Mustaqim ===

The exodus of Moroccan veterans from Afghanistan led to a wave of radical preachers in the country, who mainly gave classes regarding jihad and wrote books about the supposed &quot;godless&quot; nature of the Moroccan state and how fighting would be lawful under Islamic law. In some cases, the preachers made small booklets for followers with a primary level of education. Some followers, inspired by these classes, declared themselves &quot;emirs&quot; and garnered a small following willing to pledge allegiance to them.

One of the only preachers who had also proclaimed themselves as a &quot;spiritual guide&quot; was Zakaria Miloudi, who led a subsect of Takfir wal-Hijra named as-Sirat al-Mustaqim (). In February 2002, drug dealer Fouad Kerdoudi was stoned to death in Sidi Moumen by as-Sirat al-Mustaqim after Miloudi issued a fatwa advocating for his murder. Miloudi was arrested a month later and sentenced to a year in prison. During a police raid, documents were found showing that Miloudi was planning to set up urban guerrilla centers in Casablanca modeled after the focos.

In the late 1990s, a follower of a radical preacher named Youssef Fikri, known in the media as &quot;the emir of blood&quot;, proclaimed himself as an &quot;emir&quot; and started an offshoot of as-Sirat al-Mustaqim. Fikri&#x27;s group, known as Jamaât as-Sirat al-Mustaqim (), were named by the authorities under the umbrella title of Salafia Jihadia. Fikri, alongside around thirty co-conspirators, oversaw a killing spree of six murders and 154 assaults throughout the country, mainly against prostitutes. Fikri&#x27;s second-in-command, Mohamed Damir, was a prominent figure in the neighborhood and was seen as a social leader.

Salafia Jihadia also perpetrated carjackings and robberies, robbing an electric utility office in 2001 as well as burglaries of villas in Ain Diab. Fikri justified his crime spree as a &quot;moral campaign where debauchery and prostitution were flourishing&quot; and that his actions were initially &quot;carried out peacefully with success&quot;, he claimed that he only began his crime spree once his &quot;actions were so successful that the police started hunting us down&quot;.

In 1997, Fikri&#x27;s Salafia Jihadia group murdered a Moroccan Jew in Casablanca. In October 1998, Fikri murdered his uncle, Abdelaziz Fikri, in Youssoufia for having allegedly cheated on his wife. Fikri continued assaulting civilians in Casablanca. In 1999, Fikri was informed of a homosexual in Youssoufia who was entertaining a relationship with an employee of the OCP. Fikri and three members of the group visited the alleged homosexual&#x27;s apartment where they encountered Omar Ferrag in a bath robe, they stabbed Ferrag to death. After Fikri&#x27;s arrest, he claimed that Ferrag was killed as he was a &quot;prominent homosexual&quot; and were forced to murder him as he &quot;could not be reasoned with&quot;.

In 1999, two members of Salafia Jihadia and friends of Fikri murdered their roommate, identified by authorities with his first name of Mohamed, in Nador. Fikri was reportedly motivated by Mohamed&#x27;s &quot;Marxist tendencies&quot; and his alleged blasphemy. On September 10, 2001, three members of Salafia Jihadia encountered notary Abdelaziz Assadi alongside three women in Nador. The group pretended to be policemen before Assadi pretended to be the King&#x27;s prosecutor, upon learning of this, they held Assadi and the three women hostage before murdering Assadi and dumping his body in a well.

Fikri was arrested in Nador a year before the attacks, in January 2002. He admitted all six murders as well as the assaults, his confessions led to arrest warrants being issued against five Moroccans who had fought in Afghanistan. In October 2002, an arrest warrant was served against Mohamed Damir in Hay Mohammadi when his brother-in-law, Rabiî Aït Ouzzou, plunged a sword in a police officer before Aït Ouzzou was shot nine times and died of his injuries. Damir was shot eight times during his arrest and survived. Upon learning of Fikri&#x27;s cell, then-Director of Territorial Surveillance Hamidou Laânigri reportedly declared that &quot;Salafia Jihadia is our GIA&quot;.

=== Planning ===
According to the authorities, the suicide bombers were loyal to a group named Salafia Jihadia. All of the suicide bombers came from the slums of Sidi Moumen, including the first suicide bomber to be radicalized, 24-year-old night guard Mohamed Omari. He was a member of the largely pacifist and apolitical Tablighi Jamaat movement. In 1996, Omari met radical preacher Zakaria Miloudi and joined as-Sirat al-Mustaqim after attending his lectures. Miloudi held lectures where he notably called every Moroccan with a birth certificate or identity card apostates. Miloudi once described Parliament as a &quot;gathering of apostates and atheists&quot;. Miloudi and Omari later had a falling out after Omari embezzled funds collected for the construction of a mosque.

Omari frequented local mosques in Sidi Moumen, with footage of Osama bin Laden and Palestinian suicide bombers regularly shown on Al Jazeera appealing to the slum&#x27;s youth. It was in those mosques that Omari met many of the future suicide bombers, forming a terror cell that included Yassine Lahnech. Lachnech set up a network of 96 suicide bombers to carry out attacks for a &#x27;sequel&#x27; of May 16 in Tangier (described in his notes as &quot;the Mecca of druglords&quot;), Essaouira (&quot;the capital of Jews&quot;), Marrakesh (&quot;modern Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;), Agadir (&quot;the den of degenerates from the Gulf&quot;).

The terror cell held regular meetings at Sidi Moumen, where they held collective prayers, listened to cassettes and watched videos of the Second Chechen War and calls for jihad. These meetings were held at the homes of 21-year-old Mahjoub Grimet and 28-year-old Abdelfattah Boulikdane. Boulikdane proclaimed himself as the cell&#x27;s spiritual leader, leading prayer and supplying the group with books. According to an indictment, 25-year-old Hassan Taoussi attacked people and robbed them of their money to finance the aspiring terror cell.

In March 2003, Boulikdane met 30-year-old shoemaker Abdelhak Bentassir, known as &quot;Moul Sebbat&quot; (), at a market in Hay Mohammadi. Boulikdane was captivated by Bentassir&#x27;s radicalism, praising him to the group as a &quot;true mujahideen&quot; and admiring him as he made &quot;a good living&quot; being a shoemaker in Fez, unlike the rest of the largely-unemployed group. Bentassir later became the leader of the terror cell, proclaiming himself as the &quot;national emir&quot; and organized a ceremony where six suicide bombers sat cross-legged around him and pledged allegiance by proclaiming &quot;to swear allegiance to [Bentassir] for death on God&#x27;s path&quot;. At the end of the ceremony, Bentassir ordered the group to find other volunteers in the mosques of Sidi Moumen to pledge allegiance to him.

Investigators believe that Bentassir was &quot;the only link&quot; between the masterminds of Salafia Jihadia and the suicide bombers. He regularly visited future terrorists and gave them lessons in terrorism. Boulikdane sent two aspiring suicide bombers, 22-year-old Adil Taïa and 27-year-old Mohamed M&#x27;hanni, to find bomb-making instructions in a cybercafé. The text, in English, couldn&#x27;t be understood by the group who gave it to Bentassir. Bentassir consulted &quot;higher-ups&quot; regarding the document, believed by investigators to be Saâd Houssaïni and GICM founder Karim El Mejjati, both were veteran bomb-makers during the War in Afghanistan. Another member of the cell, 22-year-old Mohamed Hassouna was also tasked with downloading bomb-making instructions from the Internet and translated them to Arabic from English.

Houssaïni is believed to have given a detailed instruction manual to Bentassir, who gave it to Boulikdane. Boulikdane was in charge of making the explosives with Omari, with Boulikdane obtaining gunpowder while Omari provided lab equipment. The manual given to Bentassir lacks information on making a long-distance fuze, despite El Mejjati and Houssaïni knowing how to detonate a charge remotely. Investigators theorize that this was purposefully omitted by El Mejjati and Houssaïni, who &quot;wanted a kamikaze operation, spectacular and absolutely horrific to mark the spirit&quot;.

In the summer of 2001, the group carried a bomb test in a landfill in Hay Attacharouk. The bomb, attached to a long-distance fuze, did not explode. The group carried a successful attempt to detonate another bomb in the Sidi Moumen cemetery in December 2002, with Boulikdane and Omari reportedly jumping in joy upon seeing the blast. This occurred as last suicide bomber was recruited, 28-year-old kung-fu instructor and welder Rachid Jalil. He was radicalized by preacher Abderrazak Rtioui, a member of as-Sirat al-Mustaqim in a nearby slum. Jalil took a pledge of allegiance to Bentassir and trained the group in martial arts every summer in the forest of Oued Mellah.

In March 2003, Bentassir gave the group 18,000 dirham to source bomb-making materials including oxygen, acetone and nails. He chose the targets and planned for the attack to occur at 10 p.m. on May 9. Hassan Taoussi was charged with properly weighing the bomb-making chemicals. A member of the terror cell, 32-year-old Saïd Abid, scouted the target locations and recognized a &quot;drunken bastard who had swindled his older brother&quot; at the Casa de España. Eager to get revenge, Abid told Boulikdane who immediately suspended the terrorist plot, telling Abid that the &quot;whiff of vengeance emptied the operation of its dimension of jihad&quot;. Informed of the setback, Bentassir postponed the plot for a week, taking place on the 16th.

On May 14, the group settled at Omari&#x27;s house with M&#x27;hanni preparing the homemade explosives. During their stay, the future suicide bombers underwent what authorities described as &quot;psychological conditioning&quot; through watching lectures and propaganda films with themes including &quot;the last voyage&quot;, &quot;the followers of the Supreme Sacrifice&quot;, and &quot;Heaven or Hell&quot;.

On May 16, 2003, at 4 a.m., seven members the terror cell were awoken by Boulikdane in Omari&#x27;s house for Fajr prayer, they recited verses of the Quran until Zuhr prayer in the afternoon where the rest of the cell grouped together. Omari, in a bid to seem inconspicuous, prayed in a local mosque and bought medicinal herbs to soothe a stomach ache Boulikdane had been suffering from as well as dates, milk, and sandwiches for the group. In the afternoon, the group watched &quot;Russian Hell&quot;, a film produced by Ibn al-Khattab during the Second Chechen War.

After Maghrib prayer, the group shaved away their beards and were given bags by M&#x27;hanni containing a propane bomb made with a gas cylinder set to detonate five seconds after ignition, they had put on Casio F-91Ws with timers set to 10 p.m. and swapped their qamis for new jeans. Boulikdane gave the group hunting knives in the case that anyone interrupts their plans. Abid scouted the locations once more and came back at 8 p.m. with positive results. the group received a call from Bentassir giving them his blessings. The group all congratulated each other one last time, repeating &quot;see you in paradise&quot;. The suicide bombers left in small groups to avoid being noticed. The attack occurred on the 47th anniversary of Morocco&#x27;s national police force, two days after Aid al-Mawlid, and a week after the birth of Crown Prince Moulay Hassan.

=== Profile of the suicide bombers ===
French political scientist Gilles Kepel described the attacks as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s September 11&quot;, manifesting al-Qaeda&#x27;s &quot;lesser professionalism&quot; with killing Muslims. The twelve suicide bombers were all from of the Sidi Moumen slums, nine of which from the Carrière Thomas district, with an average age of 25 and many of them never pursued higher education. They were recruited through a friend, colleague or family member and were low-paid laborers or unemployed.

==Bombings==
=== Attacks ===
On May 16, 2003 at 8:45 p.m., the Casa de España restaurant was targeted by four suicide bombers during a bingo session organized at the restaurants. A security guard attempted to stop the group before one of the suicide bombers pulled out a knife and slit the guard&#x27;s throat. Once inside the restaurant, the attackers yelled &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; three times while one of the suicide bombers threw a hand-made grenade under a table. Two of the suicide bombers positioned themselves about fifteen meters from one another and simultaneously triggered their bombs. A witness claimed that the suicide bombers were also wearing explosive vests in addition to the bombs in their backpacks.

The suicide bombers at Casa de España were 32-year-old Youssef Kaoutari, 27-year-old Mohamed Laâroussi, and 32-year-old Saïd Abid. Another suicide bomber, 22-year old Mohamed El Arbaoui sprinted away from the scene before blowing himself up while being tackled by police officers. The attack on Casa de España killed 22 people, including four Spanish citizens, four French citizens, and an Italian. The head of one of the suicide bombers, Mohamed Hassouna, was found 40 meters away from the restaurant.

Following the attacks at Casa de España, 22-year-old Khaled Taib, 28-year-old Rachid Jalil, and 22-year-old Mohamed Hassouna entered the Positano, a Jewish-owned Italian restaurant, the group were stopped by a night guard and two police officers. Hassouna and Kaoutari blew themselves up in front of the restaurant, killing two police officers and the night guard. No deaths were reported inside the restaurant as the blasts was absorbed by a Mercedes 4WD parked outside the restaurant, the Belgian consulate in front of the restaurant suffered from structural damage from the detonations.

The Jewish Alliance of Casablanca was also attacked by 27-year-old Mohamed M&#x27;hanni, who blew himself up outside of the Alliance&#x27;s front door, and 23-year-old Khalid Benmoussa, who ran inside of the Alliance and blew himself up in its main hall. The attack killed nobody except for the suicide bombers as the building was closed and empty during Shabbat. The building was scheduled to have been packed the next morning for an event scheduled in the Alliance.

At 8:50 p.m., the five-star was attacked by 24-year-old Mohamed Omari and 28-year-old Abdelfattah Boulikdane, the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the terror cell. The group were turned away by a member of security before Omari stabbed the guard and was tackled by another security guard. Boulikdane rushed his way into the hotel&#x27;s bar before detonating his vest, killing the security guard, 44-year-old Hassan Karib, and a porter, 48-year-old Ahmed Atef. A hotel employee was blinded while another suffered three-degree burns to his face and thighs.

Mohamed Omari attempted to throw a homemade grenade before being knocked unconscious by the blast. Omari was barely able to get up and attempted to run before being tackled by other hotel employees as well as taxi driver Mostafa Tahiri. He was arrested while attempting to get rid of the bomb in his backpack. Omari claimed to have abandoned his plans after &quot;noticing that there were no Jews inside of the hotel&quot;, something that he would have not been able to distinguish. Investigators suggested that Omari had already discarded his bomb and was about to escape before getting injured by the blast.

25-year-old Hassan Taoussi was also projected to attack the Hotel Farah, but abandoned the rest of the terror group while they were walking to their the hotel. Taoussi went to a nearby avenue and took a taxi to a landfill in Hay Attacharouk, where he dumped the backpack containing the bomb. Taoussi took a bus to Oujda and failed to cross the Algeria–Morocco border, he later hid at a family member&#x27;s home in Berrechid where he was arrested nine days later.

22-year-old Abderrahim Belcaïd reached a fountain away from a Jewish cemetery that had been abandoned since 1950. He asked three teenage bystanders who were smoking for a light before leaning against a wall and detonating his suicide vest, killing the bystanders. It is speculated that Belcaïd was unable to find neither the alliance or the cemetery.

He was accompanied by 28-year-old Rachid Jalil, who dropped his backpack with a bomb between two cars and walked away. Jalil was told by police officers that Belcaïd turned into a panic after realizing that he had abandoned from the plot, with Belcaïd detonating his bomb while two people were attempting to take his backpack away.

The attacks were over by 9:15 p.m., 34 civilians were killed including 2 police officers, along with 11 suicide bombers.

=== Victims ===

More than 100 people were injured, 14 of which with life-threatening injuries; at least 97 of injured were Muslims. Nine of the dead were Europeans while the rest were Moroccan, one of the victims was a French-Moroccan. Despite the terrorists mainly intending to target Jews, none of the victims were Jewish as the attack occurred during Shabbat.

Among the victims was former Raja AC footballer , who was with friends at the Casa de España restaurant. Raja AC gave an apartment in Casablanca to Beggar&#x27;s family following his death. Raja AC&#x27;s historical rival in the Casablanca derby, the Wydad AC, offered 10 percent of the profits from their following football match. Lawyer Abdelouahed El Khammal and his son, Taïb, died in the attacks. El Khammal&#x27;s widow, Soad Begdouri El Khammal, founded the Moroccan Association for Victims of Terrorism (AMVT) in 2011.

== Investigation and trials ==

The investigation into the attacks was led by the General Directorate for National Security&#x27;s National Judicial Police Brigade (BNPJ), the Royal Gendarmerie, and the Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DST) under the leadership of Hamidou Laânigri. The attacks led to a vast investigation being carried out into radical Islamist circles. In the investigation into the attacks, more than 5,200 suspects were arrested and authorities questioned around 11,000 people.

Immediately after the attacks, authorities arrested surviving suicide bomber Mohamed Omari at the scene after he was injured by another suicide bomber&#x27;s blast before being tackled by hotel staff and bystanders. He was sent to the hospital and was interrogated by the BNPJ where he confessed to his role in the attacks. None of the suicide bombers had criminal records and were known to security services other than Omari for his links with Miloudi.

Police were assisted by French and American counterterrorism experts, French intelligence chief Pierre Brochand and Spanish intelligence chief Jorge Dezcallar de Mazarredo alongside officials from the FBI and the CIA met with Moroccan authorities the day after the attacks.

Omari&#x27;s confession led to the arrest of failed suicide bomber Rachid Jalil on May 18 at the Oued Mellah forest range, where he &quot;reminisced of Afghanistan&quot;. Jalil also confessed to his role in the attacks. Authorities had arrested forty people in connection with the attacks. On May 25, surviving suicide bomber Hassan Taoussi was arrested in Berrechid. A week after the attacks, Adil Charkaoui, a Moroccan-Canadian imam, was arrested in Montreal before being released. An arrest warrant had been issued by Moroccan authorities for Cherkaoui in connection with the Casablanca attacks, which he denied.

Investigators determined that the terror cell was part of Salafia Jihadia organization, a term used by Moroccan government to refer to the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM), an al-Qaeda allied group. The attack was reportedly ordered by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who financed the terror cell with $50,000 to $70,000 under the umbrella of Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad. Saad bin Laden was suspected of direct involvement in the bombings despite being under house arrest in Iran. On June 21, al-Qaeda officially claimed responsibility for the Casablanca and Riyadh attacks through a video.

Forty-five bodies, including nine from the Aïn Chock communal morgue, were taken to the CHU Ibn Rochd hospital for identification and autopsy. The task was entrusted to nine members of the hospital&#x27;s Forensic Medicine Institute, who were under time pressure, as Islamic custom requires burial at sunrise the day after death. Twenty-four of the bodies were identified by May 17, with a crisis cell being set-up within the Institute for families.

The BNPJ wrote identification reports for each body held at the hospital while communal officials issued burial permits on the spot upon identification, the Institute mobilized an imam to perform ritual ablution on the deceased. Five more bodies were identified by next Sunday.

Twelve bodies were unclaimed at the Institute, assumed to be the suicide bombers. Described as &quot;shredded&quot;, only the head and a few limbs remained. In two cases, their skull were pulverized by the blast. The Gendarmerie and the BNPJ identified seven suicide bombers with fingerprint records. Five other terrorists were identified through DNA testing.

The confessions of the three surviving suicide bombers led to the cell&#x27;s emir, Abdelhak Bentassir. Bentassir was arrested in Fez ten days after the attack, on May 26. According to authorities, Bentassir suffered from &quot;a liver four kilos thick&quot; the day of his arrest and died of &quot;heart and liver failure&quot; while being transferred to the hospital in Rabat, with an autopsy confirming he died of natural causes. Investigators told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Bentassir died of heart and liver failure after three days of near non-stop interrogation. Bentassir&#x27;s family claims that he was healthy and was detained on May 21, five days before the announcement of his arrest. His widow, Amina Mourabiti, claimed in 2013 that authorities refused to issue a death certificate for Bentassir.

A day after Bentassir&#x27;s death, King Mohammed VI broke his silence about the attacks and delivered a speech warning that those who &quot;hurt the security of the state&quot; would suffer &quot;stiff consequences&quot;, declaring that the &quot;era of lax management&quot; was over.

Some of the detainees were reportedly taken to Temara interrogation centre, where they claim to have been tortured through beatings with a stick, slaps on the face, shackling, verbal intimidation and humiliation, electric shocks, as well as sleep deprivation. Others were reportedly forced to sign a confession before being sentenced. Regarding accusations of torture, Moroccan justice minister Mohammed Bouzoubaa stated that he &quot;can&#x27;t say that there were absolutely no lapses in judgement, but what I do deny is that they were widespread&quot;.

Two days after the attack, seven suspects (including Saâd Houssaïni and Karim El Mejjati) were put on a government wanted list published by Maghreb Arabe-Presse, Morocco&#x27;s official news agency.

On June 4, 2003, French citizen Richard Antoine Pierre Robert, who was in the wanted list and was known in the press as the &quot;blue-eyed emir&quot;, was arrested. Richard Robert admitted in an interview to have participated in a plot to establish an Islamic state in the Rif mountains of Northern Morocco. Robert built a mosque with radical preacher Mohamed Fizazi with money obtained from drug trafficking.

In July 2003, four members of Salafia Jihadia kidnapped and stabbed gendarme Mohamed Hamdi to death in Sidi Bernoussi. On September 11, 2003, Moroccan Jew Albert Rebibo was shot to death in Casablanca by Taoufik El Hanouichi, who had been on the wanted list in connection with the attacks. He was arrested by the GIGR in January 2004 after being shot in the leg.

On May 1, 2004, Abdelmalek Bouzgarne was arrested alongside two suspects during a raid in Hay Hassani. The three suspects had rushed towards the police with machetes while screaming &quot;For Martyrdom!&quot; prior to being shot in the legs and tackled by police officers. He was a loyalist of Youssef Fikri and a member of Salafia Jihadia who had been on the wanted list in connection with the attacks. Authorities found evidence of murders dating from the late 1990s in Bouzargane&#x27;s hideout.

In December 2004, GICM member Hassan El Haski, who was facing charges in Spain for the 2004 Madrid bombings, was questioned over his links to the Casablanca bombings and was suspected to have helped plan them. On March 19, 2004, Belgian police arrested a suspect wanted by the Moroccan government in connection with the bombings.

On March 7, 2007, bomb-maker Saâd Houssaïni, who was also on the list, was arrested by the GIGR in a cybercafé near Sidi Maârouf after the DST tracked a GSM packet for a phone number belonging to Houssaini to the cybercafé.

=== Trials ===

The attacks led to a judicial purge against Salafia Jihadia, with Minister of Justice Mohamed Bouzoubaa announcing in 2004 that 2,112 indictments were filed against extremists leading to 903 convictions and 13 death sentences. Authorities also filed arrest warrants against 50 Moroccans and 12 foreign citizens.

On May 26, 2003, ten days after the attacks, Mohamed Omari, Rachid Jalil, and Yassine Lahnech were referred by the public prosecutor to an examining magistrate. Four days later, the public prosecutor referred eight more suspects. Omari, Jalil, Lahnech and Hassan Taoussi, were charged alongside fifty-two defendants for &quot;forming a criminal association, undermining the internal security of the state, sabotage, premeditated homicide and damage causing injury and permanent disability&quot;.

In July 2003, Youssef Fikri, the leader of Salafia Jihadia, was tried alongside thirty-one members of his network for his involvement other terrorist attacks in 2001 as well as his supposed ideological influence on the attackers. During his trial, Fikri admitted that &quot;yes, I admit to killing several of God&#x27;s enemies, and this trial is nothing more than a play&quot;. Fikri was sentenced to death alongside ten other co-conspirators. Among those sentenced to death was the group&#x27;s second-in-command, Mohammd Damir, who was reported as having disappeared until his trial.

On July 21, 2003, the trial for the attacks began at the criminal chamber of the Court of Appeal of Casablanca, who had issued an indictment against fifty-two people. Prosecution was led by Abdellah Alaoui Belghiti, the King&#x27;s general prosecutor for the Court of Appeal of Casablanca and the case was presided by Judge Lahcen Tolfi. At a preliminary hearing, Omari denied his role in the attacks, stating &quot;I reject all the accusations, I deny them, I didn&#x27;t kill anyone&quot;. The prosecutor presented propaganda cassettes from jihadist groups in Chechnya, Palestine and Afghanistan that were seized from the cell&#x27;s hideout, the defendants insisted that these were &quot;religious cassettes&quot;. Upon questioning by the prosecutor, Omari defended his role in the attacks by saying they were &quot;to highlight social inequality&quot;. Omari denied that Salafia Jihadia existed and claimed it was &quot;an invention of the newspapers&quot;, rather claiming that the attackers belonged to a group named &quot;Ahl al-Kitab wal Sunnah&quot; ().

On August 19, 2003, the court delivered its verdict, with 37 sentenced to life in prison, 17 sentenced to thirty years, and 16 sentenced to twenty years. The surviving suicide bombers, Mohamed Omari, Rachid Jalil, and Hassan Taoussi were sentenced to death. Yassine Lahnech, who had recruited a network of 96 suicide bombers to attack multiple tourist sites in the country, was also sentenced to death. Mahjoub Grimet, who helped house the terror cell, was also sentenced to thirty years in prison.

The court also sentenced radical preachers said to have had an ideological influence on the attackers, charging them with &quot;offences against the internal security of the state, criminal conspiracy, sabotage and incitement to violence&quot;. The defendants appeared inside an armoured glass cage set up in the courtroom. Many of the defendants yelled &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; while the verdict was pronounced.

Radical preacher Zakaria Miloudi, the leader of As-Sirat al-Mustaqim, was sentenced to life in prison. Preachers , Abdelkrim Chadli, , Hassan Kettani, and Omar Haddouchi were sentenced to thirty years in prison for their supposed ideological influence on the attackers. Miloudi later died in 2006 of an asthma attack in prison, with Miloudi&#x27;s family having accused the penitentiary administration of having neglected him.

In December 2005, the Court of Appeal of Salé handed down a death sentence to Salafia Islamia members Mohcine Bouarfa and Taoufik El Hanouichi. El Hanouichi murdered Albert Rebibo while on the run from authorities in connections with the Casablanca attacks. In December 2006, Salafia Jihadia members Abdelmalek Bouzgarne and Youssef Âddad were sentenced to death in connection with the Salafia Islamia killing spree in the late 1990s. Bouzgarne was also wanted for questioning in relation with the 2003 attacks.

On February 26, 2009, Saâd Houssaïni was sentenced to 15 years in prison for &quot;undermining the internal security of the state, forming a criminal gang to prepare and commit terrorist acts as part of a collective plan to cause serious damage to public order, collecting and managing funds, inciting others to commit terrorist acts and organising public meetings without authorisation&quot;. Karim El Mejjati was given a 20 year sentence in absentia.

In 2007, a French court sentenced French-Moroccans Fouad Charouali, Rachid Aït El Hadj, Bachir Ghoumid, Redouane Aberbri, and French Turk Attila Türk to prison sentences ranging from six to eight years for their material support to the Casablanca terrorist cell. In 2012, Charouali was arrested in Munich under an international arrest warrant issued by Moroccan authorities in connection with the attacks before being deported to France. In 2016, nine years after their conviction, they were stripped of their French citizenship and are facing deportation. In 2020, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in favor of the French government, ruling that &quot;terrorist violence constituted in itself a serious threat to human rights&quot;.

In 2009, Hassan El Haski was acquitted of charges relating to the attacks by an anti-terrorism court in Salé. After an appeal, El Haski was sentenced to ten years in prison and was sent to Spain to serve the remainder of his fourteen year sentence in connection with the Madrid train bombings. In 2019, El Haski was deported to Morocco after serving his sentence in Spain. The same year, a Moroccan court rejected his application to be freed on time served in Spain on the basis of double jeopardy.

In 2020, Saïd Mansour was sentenced to death by the Court of Appeal of Casablanca in connection with the attacks. He was stripped of his Danish citizenship in 2015, becoming the first person in Denmark to lose Danish citizenship, and was extradited to Morocco in 2019. Danish authorities assured that they had engaged in negotiations to avoid Mansour&#x27;s execution. In 2021, Mansour&#x27;s sentence was commuted to 25 years in prison.

==Aftermath==

The attacks were the deadliest terrorist attacks in Morocco&#x27;s history. The attacks immediately set a climate described as mass psychosis throughout Casablanca and a shell-shock effect across the country, with car crashes multiplying in the city in the following days. Journalist Hassan Hamdani described the attacks as the &quot;Moroccan equivalent of 9/11, everyone knew where they were on that day&quot;. The attacks came four days after Riyadh compound bombings and was condemned by numerous world leaders. In response to the Riyadh and Casablanca attacks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security raised its terror threat level to Orange.

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the House of Councillors voted on May 28, 2003 in favor of law no. 03-03 on the fight against terrorism, which had been criticized for its broadening of the term &quot;terrorism&quot; and has been compared to the Patriot Act. Under the new law, terrorism suspects are allowed to be detained in police custody for twelve days before being charged and presented to an examining magistrate. In the five years following the attack, around 1,000 extremists were convicted under the law.

Nine days after the attacks, a large-scale demonstration was held in Casablanca with banners saying &quot;No to terrorism&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t touch my country&quot;. Families of victims were given a compensation of 500,000 dirham from the government. The attacks led to increased focus on radical terrorism by security services, with authorities dismantling 2,000 cells and arresting 3,500 arrests on charges linked to terrorism from 2002 to 2021.

On June 28, Hamidou Laânigri, then-Director for Territorial Surveillance, was demoted to Director-General of National Security. After the attacks, Abdellatif Hammouchi was named second-in-command of the DST behind Hamidou Laânigri. Hammouchi later became the Director-General of National Security and Territorial Surveillance in 2005. In September 2003, two 14-year-old twins and a 17-year-old were arrested for plotting a suicide attack in a Rabat supermarket, the girls were sentenced to five years in a juvenile rehabilitation center.

In a speech made after the law was voted for, King Mohammed VI proclaimed in a speech that the attacks were &quot;contrary to our tolerant and generous faith&quot; and that &quot;those who ordered it and those who carried it out are despicable villains who can in no way claim to be Moroccans or authentic Muslims, so ignorant are they of the tolerance that characterizes this religion&quot;. The King toured the bombing sites and was cheered by crowds of people.

The attacks led to increased pressure on the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD), who were blamed by civil society for the attacks. The attacks were condemned by the PJD, with Ahmed Raissouni, then-president of the party&#x27;s religious branch, the , stating that the suicide bombers &quot;were the first victims as they&#x27;re headed off to hell&quot; and that they were motivated by &quot;blind ideas coming from ignorant people&quot;.

On April 24, 2004, King Mohammed VI and then-Prime Minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero inaugurated a commemorative plaque at Mohammed V Square in central Casablanca. The plaque was inscribed with a verse from the Quran: &quot;if anyone kills a person, it would be as if he killed the entirety of mankind&quot; ().

The attacks shined light at the deplorable state of shantytowns in the country, with authorities launching the &quot;Cities without slums&quot; () initiative the next year and the King announcing the National Human Development Initiative (INDH) in 2005. In 2007, a series of suicide bombings occurred in Casablanca, killing a police officer. The attacks were led by Abdelfettah Raydi, who blew himself up in a cyber-cafe, Raydi had been arrested in connection with the 2003 Casablanca attacks but was pardoned by the king.

On August 13, 2007, a civil engineer working for the Ministry of Finance detonated a gas cylinder hidden in his backpack a few meters from a tourist bus. The engineer, Hicham Doukkali, survived the blast which occurred on his 30th birthday and ripped off his left hand, broke his right leg and tore his abdomen and chest. According to authorities, he was a member of a violent offshoot of Al Adl Wal Ihsane, he was sentenced to life in prison in 2008.

In April 2008, nine prisoners motivated by &quot;injustice&quot; and imprisoned for their role in the attacks escaped from Kenitra central prison during the night by digging a 22 meter long tunnel under the prison. One of the prisoners, Abdelhadi Eddahbi, was on death row for his involvement with Youssef Fikri&#x27;s network, six were sentenced to life imprisonment and two to 20 years. The escape was seen as an embarrassment to the government which led initiatives to secure prisons across the country. The prisoners were captured in June and were given sentences ranging from 18 months to 10 years in prison.

In February 2011, Mohamed Fizazi, who was serving a sentence for his ideological influence on the attackers, was pardoned by King Mohammed VI. In February 2012, three more preachers imprisoned on the same charge, Abdelouahab Rafiqui, Hassan Kettani, and Omar Haddouchi, were pardoned by the King. As a sign of reconciliation, the King attended Friday prayers led by Fizazi in 2014. In 2011, the second-in-command of Salafia Jihadia, Mohamed Damir, had his sentence commuted to thirty years in prison. In May 2016, Youssef Fikri wrote a letter to the press requesting that his death sentence be &quot;expedited&quot;.

In 2017, the government announced a program titled &quot;Moussalaha&quot; (), where prisoners sentenced on terror charges could be eligible for a royal pardon after being rehabilitated. In August 2017, Mohamed Damir was freed as part of the Moussalaha program and started working at an association of Islamic scholars in Mohammadia where he assists detainees as part of the program. In 2021, one of the prisoners who escaped from Kenitra central prison in 2008, Mohamed Chatbi, was pardoned by the King on compassionate grounds based on &quot;medical problems&quot;.

<doc id="441078" wikidata="Q315795" url="?curid=441078" title="Bernal Díaz del Castillo">
<text>Bernal Díaz del Castillo ( 1492 – 3 February 1584) was a Spanish conquistador who participated as a soldier in the conquest of the Aztec Empire under Hernán Cortés and late in his life wrote an account of the events. As an experienced soldier of fortune, he had already participated in expeditions to Tierra Firme, Cuba, and to Yucatán before joining Cortés.

In his later years, Castillo was an encomendero and governor in Guatemala where he wrote his memoirs called &quot;The True History of the Conquest of New Spain&quot;. He began his account of the conquest almost thirty years after the events and later revised and expanded it in response to Cortés&#x27; letters to the king, which Castillo viewed as Cortés taking most of the credit for himself while minimizing the efforts and sacrifices of the other Spaniards and their indigenous allies during the expedition. In addition to this, Castillo disputed the biography published by Cortés&#x27; chaplain Francisco López de Gómara, which he considered to be largely inaccurate in that it also excessively glorified Cortés at the expense of the other soldiers. Castillo also took issue with the historical account published by the monk Bernardino de Sahagún, which he found to be overly sympathetic to the indigenous Americans, the Aztecs in particular.

Like many of the conquistadors who participated in the Spanish colonization of the Americas, Castillo was discontent that he did not achieve the great wealth he had hoped for and felt the Spanish government had failed to acknowledge his efforts and had cheated him. Having completed his memoirs, Castillo died in Guatemala at the age of 92. Though written decades after the events described, and containing numerous inaccuracies and biases, Castillo’s memoirs remain only one of two first-hand accounts of the Spanish overthrow of the Aztecs and are thus considered a valuable historical artifact. 

Attempting to explain the intentions and motivations of the Spaniards who arrived in Mexico, Castillo summarized it thus: &quot;We came to serve God and to get rich, as all men wish to do.&quot;
==Early life==
Bernal Díaz was born around the year 1492 in Medina del Campo, a prosperous commercial city in Castile. His parents were Francisco Díaz del Castillo and María Díez Rejón. His father was a (city councilor) of Medina del Campo which provided the family with some prominence. Díaz had at least one older brother and they attended school together, learning to read and write. Bernal Diaz was intelligent and later showed a knack for languages, learning to speak the Taíno language in Cuba, Nahuatl in Mexico, and the Cakchiquel language of the Guatemalan natives.

In 1514, when Díaz was about eighteen years old, he left home to join an expedition to the New World led by Pedrarias Dávila. It was the largest fleet yet sent to mainland America, consisting of 19 vessels and 1,500 persons. Díaz served as a common foot soldier and hoped to make his fortune but when they reached Darien in present-day Colombia, they were quickly overcome by famine and an epidemic that killed more than half of the settlers. Many of the colonists grew discouraged and looked elsewhere for new opportunities; some returned to Spain while others sailed to Hispaniola or Cuba.

==Expedition to Yucatán==

In 1516, Diaz sailed to Cuba with about 100 other soldiers looking for a share of the gold and native laborers that were said to be found on the island. They discovered that gold was scarce and the native labor was in short supply, leading Díaz, in 1517, to join an expedition organized by a group of about 110 disaffected soldiers and settlers to &quot;discover new lands&quot;. They chose Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, a wealthy landowner, to lead the expedition. It was a difficult venture and, after sailing from Cuba for 21 days, they came across the Yucatán coast in early March 1517, on the Cape Catoche.

On March 4, 1517, the Spanish had their first encounter with the Yucatán natives who came to meet them on five or perhaps 10, depending on the version/translation of his work, large wooden canoes. The next day, the Spaniards disembarked, invited by the natives who wanted to show them their village. They were ambushed but managed to retreat, after killing 15 locals and having 15 wounded, 2 of whom later died. Upon leaving, the Spaniards captured 2 natives who would be translators in future expeditions. The Spanish almost died of thirst and sailed to Florida in search of potable drinking water. As they were digging a well on the beach, the Spaniards were attacked by locals. During this fracas, one Spaniard was captured by the native Floridians while the Spanish killed 22 natives. The Spanish managed to make a retreat but were unable to gather water. They returned to Cuba, all of them severely wounded. The captain, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, and other soldiers died shortly after making it back to Cuba.

Nevertheless, Díaz returned to the coast of Yucatán in April 1518, in an expedition led by Juan de Grijalva, with the intent of exploring the lands. Upon returning to Cuba, he enlisted in a new expedition, this one led by Hernán Cortés.

==Conquest of Mexico==
In this third effort, Díaz took part in the campaigns against the Mexica, later called the Aztec Empire. During this campaign, Díaz spoke frequently with his fellow soldiers about their experiences. These accounts, and especially Díaz&#x27;s own experiences, served as the basis for the recollections that Díaz later told with great drama to visitors and, eventually, a book entitled (). In the latter, Díaz describes many of the 119 battles in which he participated, culminating in the defeat of the Aztecs in 1521.

This work describes the diverse native peoples living in the territory renamed &quot;New Spain&quot; by the Spaniards. Bernal Díaz also examines the political rivalries of Spaniards, and gives accounts of the natives&#x27; human sacrifices, cannibalism and idolatry, which he claims he witnessed first-hand, as well as the artistic, cultural, political and intellectual achievements of the Aztecs, including their palaces, marketplaces and beautifully organized botanical and zoological gardens. His account of the Mexica along with that of Cortés are first-person accounts recording important aspects of Mesoamerican culture. Similarly, the men&#x27;s accounts provide extensive details about the actions of the Spaniards during their invasion of the Aztec Empire, creating controversy surrounding the aggression and force used by Cortés&#x27; army. Bernal Díaz&#x27;s account has not yet been fully utilized as a source for conquest-era Mesoamerican culture.

==Governor of Antigua Guatemala==

As a reward for his service, Díaz was awarded an encomienda by Cortés in 1522. That was confirmed and supplemented by similar awards in 1527 and 1528. In 1541, he settled in Guatemala and, during the course of a trip to Spain, was appointed &quot;&quot; (governor) of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, present-day Antigua Guatemala, in 1551.

==&quot;True History&quot;==
, finished in 1568, almost fifty years after the events it described, was begun around the same time as his appointment as &quot;&quot; and was well in progress by the mid-1550s when he wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor (and king of Spain), Charles V, describing his services and seeking benefits. That was a standard action of conquerors to document their services to the crown and requests for rewards. Bernal Díaz de Castillo sent his &quot;True History&quot; to Philip II of Spain in 1579, according to Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo de Medrano, son of the famous maritime explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo.

Some version of his account circulated in Mexico in the 1560s and 1570s, prior to its seventeenth-century publication. Bernal Díaz&#x27;s account is mentioned by Alonso de Zorita, a royal official who wrote an account of indigenous society, and mestizo Diego Muñoz Camargo, who wrote a full-length account of the Tlaxcalans&#x27; participation in the conquest of the Mexica. Bernal Díaz&#x27;s manuscript was expanded in response to what he later found in the official biography of Hernán Cortés commissioned by Cortés&#x27;s heir, Don Martín Cortés, published in 1552 by Francisco López de Gómara. The title (True History) is in part a response to the claims made by Hernán Cortés in his published letters to the king, as well as to the claims of López de Gómara, Bartolomé de las Casas, Gonzalo de Illescas and others who had not participated in the campaign. Bernal Díaz also used the publication of Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda on just war, which allowed Bernal Díaz to cast the conquest of Mexico as a just conquest.

Despite this, Castillo apparently was remorseful over the destruction of Tenochtitlan, writing in his &quot;History&quot;, &quot;When I beheld the scenes around me, I thought within myself, this was the garden of the world. All of the wonders I beheld that day, nothing now remains. All is overthrown and lost.&quot;

==Death==
Bernal Díaz died in January 1584. He was alive on January 1, but on January 3, his son, Francisco, appeared before the Cabildo of Guatemala and informed them that his father had died. Miguel León-Portilla accepts this date in his Introduction (dated July 1984 &quot;a cuatro siglos de la muerte de Bernal&quot;) to the anthology of extended excerpts from the &quot;Historia verdadera&quot;. Alicia Mayer (2005) praised that edition, its selection, and León-Portilla&#x27;s introduction, saying they remained, down to the date of her review, &quot;fuente imprescindible de consulta&quot; (an indispensable source to consult) without seeing his manuscript published. An expanded and corrected copy of the manuscript kept in Guatemala was sent to Spain and published, with revisions, in 1632. The manuscript was edited by Fray Alonso de Remón and Fray Gabriel Adarzo y Santander prior to publication. In this first published edition of Bernal Díaz&#x27;s work, there is a chapter (212), which some consider apocryphal because it contains signs and portents of the conquest, omitted from later editions.

<doc id="441082" wikidata="Q1277278" url="?curid=441082" title="Earl of Erroll">
<text>Earl of Erroll () is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1453 for Sir William Hay. The subsidiary titles held by the Earl of Erroll are &quot;Lord Hay&quot; (created 1449) and &quot;Lord Slains&quot; (1452), both in the Peerage of Scotland. The Earls of Erroll also hold the hereditary office of Lord High Constable of Scotland. The office was once associated with great power. The Earls of Erroll hold the hereditary title of Chief of Clan Hay.

The Earl of Erroll is one of four peers entitled to appoint a private pursuivant, with the title &quot;Slains Pursuivant of Arms&quot;. Earl of Erroll is also the name of a Scottish highland dance, danced today at Highland games around the world.

The family seat is Woodbury House, near Everton, Bedfordshire.

==History==

The Hay clan descends from Scoto-Norman knight Guillaume de la Haye, who first appears on the records circa 1160.

Gilbert de la Hay (died April 1333), ancestor of the Earls of Erroll, was the older brother of William de la Hay, ancestor of the Earls of Kinnoull. In 1251, William received a charter of two carucates of land from his brother, which was confirmed by King Alexander III.

==Regrant of the earldom of Erroll==
A regrant was one of the peculiarities in the Scottish law of peerage, that a party might, by a resignation to the Crown, and a charter following upon such resignation, obtain power to nominate the heirs to succeed him in his honours and dignities. Some of the highest of the Scottish peerages are held under such nominations.

Gilbert Hay, 11th Earl of Erroll, on 13 November 1666, obtained a regrant of his honours. This regrant had special power to nominate his heirs. This nomination was made in 1674 with Gilbert appointing his cousin Sir John Hay of Keillour and his heir male, failing which, appointing Sir John Hay of Keillour&#x27;s heir female, and failing which, appointing certain Hays of Tweeddale. The 11th Earl of Erroll having died in 1674 without issue, Sir John Hay of Keillour became 12th Earl of Erroll. On his death in 1704, his son, Charles became the 13th Earl of Erroll. Charles died unmarried in 1717, when the title devolved on his sister, Mary.

Mary Hay, 14th Countess of Erroll died in 1758 without issue. Mary&#x27;s sister Margaret had previously died at Rome in 1723, however she had married James Livingston, 5th Earl of Linlithgow, 4th Earl of Callendar, and had issue, and it is from her that the present Earl of Erroll is descended.

This regrant was questioned in the House of Lords in 1797. The then Earl of Lauderdale had questioned George, the 16th Earl of Erroll&#x27;s right to vote at an election of the peers of Scotland. One of the objections made to the title was that the title of Earl of Erroll was claimed through a nomination. It was decided in 1748 in the case of the earldom of Stair that this power of nomination could not be validly exercised after the Union. The House of Lords, after a full inquiry, decided in favour of the 16th Earl of Erroll&#x27;s right to the title. That the Earl of Erroll holds the honours of his house undoubtedly and without dispute, is clear from the decision of the House of Lords.

<text>Constantines is an indie rock band from Guelph, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
Constantines was formed in 1999, by vocalist and guitarist Bryan Webb, drummer Doug MacGregor, and guitarist Paul Bright, all of whom had played together in the emo band Shoulder from 1994 to 1997; with the addition of bassist Dallas Wehrle. Bright was asked to leave early on and was replaced by Steve Lambke. Their style has been described as &quot;art-punk&quot;, and they have been compared to bands like The Clash, Fugazi, Bruce Springsteen, The Replacements, and Nick Cave.

The name of the band is taken from an episode of &quot;Coast to Coast with Art Bell&quot;, in which Bell was playing recordings of ghost voices in static, and one of the ghosts&#x27; names was Constantine.

From their hometown of Guelph the band relocated to London, Ontario and then to Toronto, where in 2001 they released their self-titled first album. &quot;Constantines&quot; enjoyed widespread play on campus radio and was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album. The first track, &quot;Arizona&quot;, is based on the suicide of Danny Rapp, the lead singer of Danny and the Juniors of &quot;At the Hop&quot; fame. The song begins with the lyric &quot;This is a song about the death of Danny Rapp. And that great gospel jest called rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; That year they performed at the El Mocambo in Toronto with Oneida and Grand Total.

In 2002 they added keyboard player Evan Gordon to the lineup and released the EP &quot;The Modern Sinner Nervous Man&quot;. Gordon left the band soon after to pursue his own song writing. He was replaced by Will Kidman, and the band released &quot;Shine a Light&quot; in 2003. This album was the band&#x27;s first to be released outside of Canada on the Sub Pop record label. It topped the !earshot National Top 50 chart in September that year. &quot;Shine a Light&quot; also earned the band their second Juno Award nomination for Alternative Album of the Year.

In 2004, the label Sub Pop reissued the band&#x27;s self-titled album. The next year, they embarked on a cross-Canada tour with The Weakerthans called &quot;The Rolling Tundra Revue&quot;. Later in the year their album &quot;Tournament of Hearts&quot; was released September 27 by Toronto record label Three Gut Records in Canada, and on October 11 by Sub Pop in the United States.

The members of Constantines have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze, covering Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. Constantines recorded four Neil Young covers for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.

In 2007, following the demise of their Canadian former record label Three Gut Records, Constantines signed with Arts &amp; Crafts. On January 15, 2008, they released a limited edition 7&quot; on white vinyl, entitled &quot;Hard Feelings&quot;. Their fourth full-length album, &quot;Kensington Heights&quot;, was released on April 15 in Canada and April 29 in the US. The band played SP20 that summer, a festival in Redmond, Washington celebrating the 20th anniversary of Sub Pop Records. 

Guitarist Steve Lambke has released four albums and a split 12&quot; under the name Baby Eagle, and keyboard player Will Kidman has appeared and recorded under the name Woolly Leaves.

In December 2009, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary with a tour of southwestern Ontario. Shortly thereafter, keyboardist Will Kidman left the band. This, coupled with Webb&#x27;s move from his home in Montreal back to Guelph, fueled rumours of the band&#x27;s demise. Although Webb hinted that the band might return.
Constantines went on an unofficial hiatus for several years.

In 2014 Constantines reformed for a reunion tour, performing at festivals around Canada, including SappyFest and at Kazoo!Fest in Guelph. In May 2015 the band performed at Massey Hall in Toronto with Chad VanGaalen

Constantines were on the line-up for Wayhome summer 2017 music festival in Oro-Medonte, Ontario. and once more performed at Kazoo!Fest.

In 2020, Constantines digitally self-released charity single &quot;Call Me Out&quot; written in 2017 and recorded in 2018. The song was not published on streaming platforms and instead was only made available as a purchasable Bandcamp download with 100% of its proceeds being donated to Black Lives Matter Toronto and the Unistʼotʼen Camp Legal Fund.

<text>Ivor Armstrong Richards CH (26 February 1893 – 7 September 1979), known as I. A. Richards, was an English educator, literary critic, poet, and rhetorician. His work contributed to the foundations of New Criticism, a formalist movement in literary theory which emphasized the close reading of a literary text, especially poetry, in an effort to discover how a work of literature functions as a self-contained and self-referential æsthetic object.

Richards&#x27; intellectual contributions to the establishment of the literary methodology of New Criticism are presented in the books &quot;The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism&quot; (1923), by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards, &quot;Principles of Literary Criticism&quot; (1924), &quot;Practical Criticism&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Philosophy of Rhetoric&quot; (1936).

==Biography==

Richards was born in Sandbach. He was educated at Clifton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his intellectual talents were developed by the scholar Charles Hicksonn &#x27;Cabby&#x27; Spence. He began his career without formal training in literature; he studied philosophy (the &quot;moral sciences&quot;) at Cambridge University, from which derived his assertions that, in the 20th century, literary study cannot and should not be undertaken as a specialisation, in and of itself, but studied alongside a cognate field, such as philosophy, psychology or rhetoric. His early teaching appointments were as adjunct faculty: at Cambridge, Magdalene College would not pay a salary for Richards to teach the new, and untested, academic field of English literature. Instead, like an old-style instructor, he collected weekly tuition directly from the students as they entered the classroom.

Richards was appointed a college lecturer in English and moral sciences at Magdalene in 1922. Four years later, when the Faculty of English at Cambridge was formally established, he was awarded a permanent post as a university lecturer. In the 1929–30 biennium, as a visiting professor, he taught Basic English and Poetry at Tsinghua University, Beijing. In the 1936–38 triennium, he was the director of the Orthological Institute of China. Eventually tiring of academic life at Cambridge, in 1939 he accepted an offer to teach in the school of education at Harvard University. Appointed a professor in 1944, he remained there until his retirement in 1963. In 1974, he returned to Cambridge, having retained his fellowship at Magdalene, and lived in Wentworth House in the grounds of the college until his death five years later.

In 1926, Richards married Dorothy Pilley, whom he had met on a mountain climbing holiday in Wales. She died in 1986. Pilley&#x27;s book recounts many of the climbs they did together in the 1920&#x27;s and 1930s, including their celebrated 1928 first ascent of the north north west ridge of the Dent Blanche in the Swiss Alps.

==Contributions==
===Collaborations with C. K. Ogden===
The life and intellectual influence of I. A. Richards approximately corresponds to his intellectual interests; many endeavours were in collaboration with the linguist, philosopher, and writer Charles Kay Ogden (C. K. Ogden), notably in four books:

I. &quot;Foundations of Aesthetics&quot; (1922) presents the principles of &quot;aesthetic reception&quot;, the bases of the literary theory of “harmony”; aesthetic understanding derives from the balance of competing psychological impulses. The structure of the &quot;Foundations of Aesthetics&quot;—a survey of the competing definitions of the term &quot;æsthetic&quot;—prefigures the multiple-definitions work in the books &quot;Basic Rules of Reason&quot; (1933), &quot;Mencius on the Mind: Experiments in Multiple Definition&quot; (1932), and &quot;Coleridge on Imagination&quot; (1934)

II. &quot;The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism&quot; (1923) presents the triadic theory of semiotics that depends upon psychological theory, and so anticipates the importance of psychology in the exercise of literary criticism. Semioticians, such as Umberto Eco, acknowledged that the methodology of the triadic theory of semiotics improved upon the methodology of the dyadic theory of semiotics presented by Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913).

III. &quot;Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar&quot; (1930) describes a simplified English based upon a vocabulary of 850 words.

IV. &quot;The Times of India Guide to Basic English&quot; (1938) sought to develop Basic English as an international auxiliary language, an interlanguage.

Richards&#x27; travels, especially in China, effectively situated him as the advocate for an international program, such as Basic English. Moreover, at Harvard University, in his international pedagogy, he began to integrate the available new media for mass communications, especially television.

===Aesthetics and literary criticism===
====Theory====
Richards elaborated on an approach to literary criticism in &quot;The Principles of Literary Criticism&quot; (1924) and &quot;Practical Criticism&quot; (1929) which embodied aspects of the scientific approach from his study of psychology, particularly that of Charles Scott Sherrington.

In &quot;The Principles of Literary Criticism&quot;, Richards discusses the subjects of form, value, rhythm, coenesthesia (an awareness of inhabiting one&#x27;s body, caused by stimuli from various organs), literary infectiousness, allusiveness, divergent readings, and belief. He starts from the premise that &quot;A book is a machine to think with, but it need not, therefore, usurp the functions either of the bellows or the locomotive.&quot;

&quot;Practical Criticism&quot; (1929), is an empirical study of &quot;inferior response&quot; to a literary text. As an instructor in English literature at Cambridge University, Richards tested the critical-thinking abilities of his pupils; he removed authorial and contextual information from thirteen poems and asked undergraduates to write interpretations, in order to ascertain the likely impediments to an &quot;adequate response&quot; to a literary text. That experiment in the pedagogical approach—critical reading without contexts—demonstrated the variety and depth of the possible textual misreadings that might be committed, by university students and laymen alike.

The critical method derived from that pedagogical approach did not propose a new hermeneutics, a new methodology of interpretation, but questioned the purposes and efficacy of the critical process of literary interpretation, by analysing the self-reported critical interpretations of university students. To that end, effective critical work required a closer aesthetic interpretation of the literary text as an object.

To substantiate interpretive criticism, Richards provided theories of metaphor, value, and tone, of stock response, incipient action, and pseudo-statement; and of ambiguity. This last subject, the theory of &quot;ambiguity&quot;, was developed in &quot;Seven Types of Ambiguity&quot; (1930), by William Empson, a former student of Richards&#x27;; moreover, additional to &quot;The Principles of Literary Criticism&quot; and &quot;Practical Criticism&quot;, Empson&#x27;s book on ambiguity became the third foundational document for the methodology of the New Criticism.

To Richards, literary criticism was impressionistic, too abstract to be readily grasped and understood, by most readers; and he proposed that literary criticism could be precise in communicating meanings, by way of denotation and connotation. To establish critical precision, Richards examined the psychological processes of writing and reading poetry. In reading poetry and making sense of it &quot;in the degree in which we can order ourselves, we need nothing more&quot;; the reader need not believe the poetry, because the literary importance of poetry is in provoking emotions in the reader.

====New rhetoric====

As a rhetorician, Richards said that the old form of studying rhetoric (the art of discourse) was too concerned with the mechanics of formulating arguments and with conflict; instead, he proposed the New Rhetoric to study the meaning of the parts of discourse, as &quot;a study of misunderstanding and its remedies&quot; to determine how language works. That ambiguity is expected, and that meanings (denotation and connotation) are not inherent to words, but are inherent to the perception of the reader, the listener, and the viewer. By their usages, compiled from experience, people decide and determine meaning by &quot;how words are used in a sentence&quot;, in spoken and written language.

===== The semantic triangle =====

Richards and Ogden created the semantic triangle to deliver an improved understanding of how words come to mean. The semantic triangle has three parts, the symbol or word, the referent, and the thought or reference. In the bottom, right corner is the referent, the thing, in reality. Placed in the left corner is the symbol or word. At the top point, the convergence of the literal word and the object in reality; it is our intangible idea about the object. Ultimately, the English meaning of the words is determined by an individual&#x27;s unique experience.

===Feedforward===

When the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; asked Richards to write a piece for their &quot;What I Have Learned&quot; series, Richards (then aged 75) took the opportunity to expound upon his cybernetic concept of &quot;feedforward&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records that Richards coined the term feedforward in 1951 at the Eighth Macy Conferences on cybernetics. In the event, the term extended the intellectual and critical influence of Richards to cybernetics which applied the term in a variety of contexts. Moreover, among Richards&#x27; students was Marshall McLuhan, who also applied and developed the term and the concept of feedforward.

According to Richards, feedforward is the concept of anticipating the effect of one&#x27;s words by acting as our own critic. It is thought to work in the opposite direction of feedback, though it works essentially towards the same goal: to clarify unclear concepts. Existing in all forms of communication, feedforward acts as a pretest that any writer can use to anticipate the impact of their words on their audience. According to Richards, feedforward allows the writer to then engage with their text to make necessary changes to create a better effect. He believes that communicators who do not use feedforward will seem dogmatic. Richards wrote more in depth about the idea and importance of feedforward in communication in his book &quot;Speculative Instruments&quot; and said that feedforward was his most important learned concept.

===Influence===
Richards served as a mentor and teacher to other prominent critics, most notably William Empson and F. R. Leavis, although Leavis was contemporary with Richards, and Empson was much younger. Other critics primarily influenced by his writings included Cleanth Brooks and Allen Tate. Later critics who refined the formalist approach to New Criticism by actively rejecting his psychological emphasis included, besides Brooks and Tate, John Crowe Ransom, W. K. Wimsatt, R. P. Blackmur, and Murray Krieger. R. S. Crane of the Chicago School was both indebted to Richards&#x27;s theory and critical of its psychological assumptions. They all admitted the value of his seminal ideas but sought to salvage what they considered his most useful assumptions from the theoretical excesses they felt he brought to bear in his criticism. Like Empson, Richards proved a difficult model for the New Critics, but his model of close reading provided the basis for their interpretive methodology.

<text>José Bruno Carranza Ramírez (October 5, 1822 – January 25, 1891) was briefly President of Costa Rica (albeit with the title &quot;Temporary Head of the Republic&quot;) in 1870. Bruno Carranza came to power in the coup d&#x27;état of 27 April 1870 that deposed President Jesús Jiménez. He resigned three months later.

His parents were Miguel Carranza Fernández (Vice-Head of State between 1838 and 1841) and Joaquina Ramírez y García. In 1847 he married Gerónima Montealegre, sister of President José María Montealegre Fernández. His great-great-granddaughter is actress Madeleine Stowe.

== Studies and career ==

Carranza graduated in medicine from the University of San Carlos in Guatemala.

After returning to Costa Rica he practiced both privately and in the State-run Hospital San Juan de Dios. He was inspector general of vaccinations and proto-medicines. He served in Nicaragua as a military doctor during the 1856 Campaign against William Walker, but had to return almost immediately due to a Costa Rican Army retreat and a cholera epidemic.

He also worked as a journalist, publishing several newsletters and newspapers such as &quot;El Álbum&quot; (&quot;The Album&quot;) and &quot;La Estrella del Irazú&quot; (&quot;The Irazú Star&quot;). He was also active in other diverse economic and commercial ventures, and among other businesses, he owned coffee plantations, a book store, and a boutique. From 1855 to 1859 he was awarded the administration of the National Liquor Factory and thus became the only official State supplier of alcohol.

== Public office ==

He was deputy for several periods under the Mora Porras administration. He became the Costa Rican ambassador to El Salvador in 1857. He represented San José in the Constituent Assembly of 1869, although he stepped down soon after his election. Politically he was considered a liberal, sometimes even anti-clerical, and was exiled more than once because of his political beliefs.

The coup d&#x27;état of 27 April 1870 turned him into the head of state with the official title of &quot;Temporary Head of the Republic&quot; (in Spanish &quot;Jefe Provisorio de la República&quot;). During his administration the district of Limón was created, laws outlining personal and religious freedoms were dictated, and a law of guarantees was passed which for the first time in the country&#x27;s history banned the death penalty. The so-called &quot;Secretarías de Estado&quot; were also regulated and new elections for a Constituent Assembly were held.

The principal figure in his administration and author of his policies towards external relations and freedom of creed was the Guatemalan lawyer Lorenzo Montúfar y Rivera, noted advocated of anti-clericalism. Other notable Secretaries of State during his time in office were Joaquín Lizano Gutiérrez (government, police, justice, agriculture, and industry), Rafael Gallegos Sáenz (housing and commerce), and Buenaventura Carazo Alvarado (war, navy, and public works).

Due to differences with Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez on August 8, 1870, he presented his resignation to the Constituent Assembly, which was accepted the next day on August 9. General Guardia succeeded him.

He was later a member of the Grand National Counsel and Plenipotentiary Minister of Costa Rica in El Salvador, where he signed the Carranza-Arbizú Accord.

<text>Brompton Road is a disused station on the Piccadilly line of the London Underground, located between Knightsbridge and South Kensington stations.

It was closed in 1934, nearly 28 years after being opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway company. During the Second World War it was used as the command centre of the 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. In 2014, the owner of the site, the Ministry of Defence, sold it to a Ukrainian businessman, Dmytro Firtash, who claimed an intention to convert it to residential use.

London Transport Museum runs regular Zoom-hosted virtual tours of the station via its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme; which explore its time as a Second World War bunker and reveal what it looks like today.

==History==
Brompton Road was opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR). The station was located at the junction of Brompton Road and Cottage Place. Although it was conveniently situated for both the Brompton Oratory and the Victoria and Albert Museum, it saw little passenger usage and by October 1909 some services passed through without stopping.
The station closed on 4 May 1926 due to the general strike and did not reopen until 4 October of that year with services initially only calling there on weekdays. Sunday services were restored on 2 January 1927. As before, Brompton Road was little used, to the extent that two of its lifts were removed and relocated elsewhere and the ticket office was closed.

When the adjacent Knightsbridge station was modernised with escalators replacing lifts, it was provided with a new southern entrance that was built closer to Brompton Road station, reducing its catchment area. When the new entrance for Knightsbridge opened on 30 July 1934, Brompton Road closed.

Just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, the street-level building together with the lift shafts and lower western passages were sold to the War Office for a sum of £22,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) for use by the 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade of the 1st Anti-Aircraft Division. During the War, it was the Royal Artillery&#x27;s anti-aircraft operations room for central London. This use was discontinued in the 1950s. It was subsequently used as the town headquarters (THQ) of the University of London Air Squadron, the University of London Royal Naval Unit and 46F (Kensington) Squadron Air Training Corps.

==Station building==

Like the others on the GNP&amp;BR, the station building was designed by Leslie Green. The surface building occupied an L-shaped site built on two adjacent sides of a public house which occupied the corner of Brompton Road and Cottage Place. The façades were of Green&#x27;s standard red-glazed terracotta design with semi-circular arches at first floor level. The entrance and exits to the lifts were on Brompton Road with the Cottage Place elevation providing staff access. The Brompton Road elevation was demolished in 1972, but the Cottage Place elevation remains, now partly incorporated into a larger building.

Although the platforms have long since been removed, their original location can be seen from passing trains by the brick walls that stand in their place. The original tiling remains on the tunnel walls, although soot and dirt now obscures them.

==Proposals for reuse==

In 2011, proposals from The Old London Underground Company were made suggesting the parts of the station which were used during World War II be opened to the public, with the remainder of the above-ground buildings becoming a restaurant, and the rest of the underground space being turned over to the London Fire Brigade Museum.

In July 2013, the Ministry of Defence announced the site was for sale, with an expected price of about £20 million. The MoD&#x27;s property surveyor said specialist developers could adapt the site but stated &quot;a lot of work was needed&quot;. In May 2014, the site was sold for £53 million to Dmytro Firtash, a billionaire Ukrainian businessman who claimed an intention to convert it to residential use. The property remained unused .

==In popular culture==
A 1928 comedy play by Jevan Brandon-Thomas was about a woman who lived near Brompton Road and felt that life was passing her by just as the non-stopping trains were, and so it was titled &quot;Passing Brompton Road&quot;. The London production starring Marie Tempest ran for 174 performances. (For a 1931 film adaptation, the title was changed to &quot;Her Reputation&quot;.)

Another play in 2008 used the station. &quot;Sailing By&quot;, by Anthony Chew, took place on the long-closed platform, where two people sit and talk while Death stalks them.

<doc id="441107" wikidata="Q698866" url="?curid=441107" title="Maurice Strong">
<text>Maurice Frederick Strong, (April 29, 1929 – November 27, 2015) was a Canadian oil and mineral businessman and a diplomat who served as Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Strong had his start as an entrepreneur in the Alberta oil patch and was President of Power Corporation of Canada until 1966. In the early 1970s he was Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and then became the first executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme. He returned to Canada to become Chief Executive Officer of Petro-Canada from 1976 to 1978. He headed Ontario Hydro, one of North America&#x27;s largest power utilities, was national president and chairman of the Extension Committee of the World Alliance of YMCAs and headed American Water Development Incorporated. He served as a commissioner of the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1986 and was unironically recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a leader in the international environmental movement.

He was President of the Council of the University for Peace from 1998 to 2006. More recently Strong was an active honorary professor at Peking University and honorary chairman of its Environmental Foundation. He was chairman of the advisory board for the Institute for Research on Security and Sustainability for Northeast Asia. He died at the age of 86 in 2015.

== Childhood and youth ==
Maurice Strong was a child during the Great Depression, enduring serious poverty. His father was laid off at the beginning of the Depression era and thereafter supported his family on odd jobs; his mother succumbed to mental illness and died in a mental hospital. He was born in Oak Lake, Manitoba, a town on the Canadian prairies on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. He is a cousin of American journalist and activist Anna Louise Strong.

Strong later said that growing up during the Depression radicalized him and that he considered himself to be &quot;a socialist in ideology, a capitalist in methodology.&quot; He dropped out of high school at the age of 14 and did not attend university. Despite the lack of formal education, he became CEO of many companies.

==Business==
In 1948, when he was nineteen, Strong was hired as a trainee by a brokerage firm, James Richardson &amp; Sons, Limited of Winnipeg where he took an interest in the oil business, being transferred as an oil specialist to Richardson&#x27;s office in Calgary, Alberta. There he made the acquaintance of one of the figures in the oil industry, Jack Gallagher, who hired him as his assistant. At Gallagher&#x27;s Dome Petroleum, Strong occupied several roles including vice president of finance, leaving the firm in 1956 and setting up his own firm, M.F. Strong Management, assisting investors in locating opportunities in the Alberta oil patch.

In the 1950s, he took over a small natural gas company, Ajax Petroleum, and built it into one of the largest companies in the industry, Norcen Resources. This attracted the attention of one of Canada&#x27;s principal investment corporations with interests in the energy and utility businesses, Power Corporation of Canada. It appointed him initially as its executive vice president and then president from 1961 until 1966.

In 1976, at the request of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Strong returned to Canada to head the newly created national oil company, Petro-Canada.

He was slated to stand as a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in Scarborough Centre in the 1979 federal election, but chose to abandon the race, returning to private enterprise to manage AZL Resources, a Denver oil promoter that he had previously acquired, where he served as chairman and was the largest shareholder. In 1981, Strong was sued for allegedly hyping the stock ahead of a merger that eventually failed. Strong settled for $4.2 million at the insistence of his insurance company. AZL merged with Tosco Corporation from which Strong acquired the Baca Ranch in Colorado which would house Strong&#x27;s Manitou Foundation.

Strong later became chairman of the Canada Development Investment Corporation, the holding company for some of Canada&#x27;s principal government-owned corporations. In 1992, he became Chairman of Ontario Hydro.

Charles Lynch noted that Strong &quot;tended to fare better than the companies and institutions that have used his talents.&quot; He was said to have become a billionaire as a result of his several ventures, but in 2010 he said that he had &quot;never been anywhere close to being [so].&quot;

===American Water Development===
On December 31, 1986, Strong founded American Water Development Incorporated (AWDI) which he controlled along with his associates, William Ruckelshaus, Richard Lamm, Samuel Belzberg, and Alexander Crutchfield Jr. It filed an application with the District Court for Water Division 3 in Alamosa, Colorado for the right to pump underground water from the lands of the Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4 and other lands in Saguache County, Colorado in Colorado&#x27;s San Luis Valley and sell it to water districts in the Front Range Urban Corridor of Colorado. The project was opposed by neighboring water rights owners, local water conservation districts, the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and the National Park Service who alleged the project would affect others&#x27; water rights and cause significant environmental damage to nearby wetland and sand dune ecosystems by reducing the flow of surface water. After a lengthy trial, which ended in 1992, Colorado courts ruled against AWDI and required payment of the portion of the objectors&#x27; legal fees, $3.1 million, which were spent fighting AWDI&#x27;s attempt to appropriate surface water for beneficial use. While this was going on, Strong exited the company.

=== Molten Metal Technology ===
Maurice Strong was a director of Molten Metal Technology, Inc., an environmental technology company founded in 1989 that claimed to have innovative technology that could be used to recycle hazardous waste into reusable products. During the years 1992–1995, this innovation attracted approximately $25 million in research grants from the United States Department of Energy. Throughout the period of March 28, 1995 – October 18, 1996, (known as the &quot;class period&quot;), Molten Metal artificially inflated the price of their stock by materially misrepresenting the capability of its technology, namely through a series of public announcements. As of March 11, 1996 Strong owned approximately 40,000 shares of stock and another 262,000 shares were owned by a company of which Strong was Chairman. The company filed for bankruptcy and the case was settled for $11.8 million, without a ruling of wrongdoing.

== United Nations work ==

Strong was sharing a house in 1947 with the first UN Treasurer, Noah Monod, who upon request arranged a UN job for him, starting as a junior security officer at UN headquarters in Lake Success, New York. He later returned to Canada, and with the support of Lester B. Pearson, directed the founding of the Canadian International Development Agency in 1968.

=== Stockholm Conference ===

In 1971, Strong commissioned a report on the state of the planet, &quot;Only One Earth: The Care and Maintenance of a Small Planet&quot;, co-authored by Barbara Ward and Rene Dubos. The report summarized the findings of 152 leading experts from 58 countries in preparation for the first UN meeting on the environment, held in Stockholm in 1972. This was the world&#x27;s first &quot;state of the environment&quot; report.

The Stockholm Conference established the environment as part of an international development agenda. It led to the establishment by the UN General Assembly in December 1972 of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, and the election of Strong to head it. UNEP was the first UN agency to be headquartered in the third world. As head of UNEP, Strong convened the first international expert group meeting on climate change.

Strong was one of the commissioners of the World Commission on Environment and Development, set up as an independent body by the United Nations in 1983.

=== Earth Summit ===
Strong&#x27;s role in leading the U.N.&#x27;s famine relief program in Africa was his first in a series of U.N. advisory assignments, including reform and his appointment as Secretary General of the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, best known as the Earth Summit, and held in Rio de Janeiro from June 3 to June 14, 1992. According to Strong, participants at the Rio Conference adopted sound principles but did not make a commitment to action sufficient to prevent global environmental tragedy, committing to spend less than 5% of the $125 billion he felt appropriate for environmental projects in developing nations. He was seconded in that opinion by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who stated to the delegates, &quot;The current level of commitment is not comparable to the size and gravity of the problems,&quot;

After the Earth Summit, Strong continued to take a leading role in implementing the results of agreements at the Earth Summit through the establishment of the Earth Council, acting as co-chair of the Earth Charter Commission at the outset of the Earth Charter movement, his chairmanship of the World Resources Institute, membership on the board of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Stockholm Environment Institute, The Africa-America Institute, the Institute of Ecology in Indonesia, the Beijer Institute of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and others. Strong was a longtime Foundation Director of the World Economic Forum, a senior advisor to the president of the World Bank, a member of the International Advisory of Toyota Motor Corporation, the Advisory Council for the Center for International Development at Harvard University, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the World Conservation Union (IUCN), the World Wildlife Fund, Resources for the Future and the Eisenhower Fellowships. His public service activities were carried out on a &quot;pro bono&quot; basis made possible by his business activities, which included being chairman of the International Advisory Group of CH2M Hill, Strovest Holdings, Technology Development Inc., Zenon Environmental, and most recently, Cosmos International and the China Carbon Corporation.

Strong lobbied to change NGO perspectives on the World Bank. He is believed by some to have inspired the works of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore on climate change. In 1999 Strong took on the task of trying to restore the viability of the University for Peace, headquartered in Costa Rica, established under a treaty. The reputation of the University of Peace was at risk because the organization had been subjected to mismanagement, misappropriation of funds and inoperative governance. As chairman of its governing body, the Council, and initially as rector, Strong led the process of revitalizing the University for Peace and helped to rebuild its programs and leadership. He retired from the Council in the spring of 2007.

From 2003 to 2005, Strong served as the personal envoy to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to lead support for the international response to the humanitarian and development needs of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea.

=== University for Peace ===
The University for Peace was established in 1980 by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Maurice Strong became director in 1999 where he was at the center of further controversy, particularly in reference to the eviction of the beloved radio station Radio for Peace International (RFPI), the fleeing of the Earth Council in 2003, and the implementation of military training programs on campus. Strong was a board member of the Earth Council, which was created as an international body to promote the environmental policies established at Earth Summit in 1992. The Costa Rican government donated more than 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land to be used by Earth Council, but when plans for building fell through, it was allegedly sold for $1.65 million. Earth Council temporarily moved to the UPEACE campus until December 2003 when it moved to Canada in the midst of government accusations and demands for $1.65 million. RFPI was served with an eviction notice in July 2002, based on claims the station was operating without proper permits, which RFPI refuted. Those close to the situation claim that UPEACE officials didn&#x27;t approve of the criticism they were receiving from the station and took matters into their own hands when power to the building was cut and a wire fence put up around the perimeter.

=== 2005 Oil-for-Food scandal ===
In 2005, during investigations into the U.N.&#x27;s Oil-for-Food Programme, evidence procured by federal investigators and the U.N.-authorized inquiry of Paul Volcker showed that in 1997, while working for Annan, Strong had endorsed a cheque for $988,885, made out to &quot;Mr. M. Strong,&quot; issued by a Jordanian bank. It was reported that the cheque was hand-delivered to Mr. Strong by a South Korean businessman, Tongsun Park, who in 2006 was convicted in New York federal court of conspiring to bribe U.N. officials to rig Oil-for-Food in favor of Saddam Hussein. Mr. Strong was never accused of any wrongdoing. During the inquiry, Strong stepped down from his U.N. post, stating that he would &quot;sideline himself until the cloud was removed.&quot;

The affair was said to have arisen from &quot;the tangled nest of personal relationships, public-private partnerships, murky trust funds, unaudited funding conduits, and inter-woven enterprises that the modern U.N. has come to embody&quot; in which Strong had a major role. In reply, Strong stated that &quot;everything I did, I checked it out carefully with the U.S.&quot;

Shortly after this, Strong moved to an apartment he owned in Beijing, where he appeared to have settled. He said that his departure from the U.N. was motivated not by the Oil-for-Food investigations, but by his sense at the time, as Mr. Annan&#x27;s special adviser on North Korea, that the U.N. had reached an impasse. &quot;It just happened to coincide with the publicity surrounding my so-called nefarious activities,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I had no involvement at all in Oil-for-Food ... I just stayed out of it.&quot; In Volcker&#x27;s September 7 report he concluded, &quot;While there is evidence that Iraqi officials tried to establish a relationship with Mr. Strong, the Committee has found no evidence that Mr. Strong was involved in Iraqi affairs or matters relating to the Programme or took any action at the request of Iraqi officials.&quot;

=== UN Secretary General&#x27;s tribute ===
Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, near the end of his term, paid the following tribute to Maurice Strong:
=== Later involvement ===

In 2010, Strong described the nature of his activities at that time:
In 2012 for Rio+20 he contributed to a book by Felix Dodds and Michael Strauss titled &quot;Only One Earth — the Long Road via Rio to Sustainable Development&quot;, which reviewed the last forty years and the challenges for the future. He attended the conference, for which the United Nations Development Program paid all his travel expenses.

=== Controversy ===
Maurice Strong was no stranger to skepticism and criticism as a result of his lifelong involvement in the oil industry, juxtaposed with his heavy ties to the environmental issues. Some wonder why an &quot;oilman&quot; would be chosen to take on such coveted and respected environmental positions. One of Strong&#x27;s companies, Desarrollos Ecológicos (Ecological Development), built a $35 million luxury hotel within the Jairo Mora Sandoval Gandoca-Manzanillo Mixed Wildlife Refuge in Costa Rica where development is restricted and must be approved by the Kekoldi Indian Association, which it was not. &quot;He (Strong) is supporting Indians and conservation around the world and here he&#x27;s doing the complete opposite,&quot; lamented Demetrio Myorga, President of the Kekoldi Indian Association. Maurice Strong was a close adviser to former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and became embroiled in what is now known as the Oil for Food Program Scandal and reportedly received millions of dollars from North Korean and Iraqi lobbyists.

== Death, funeral and memorial services ==
Strong died at the age of 86 on November 27, 2015 in Ottawa, Ontario. A funeral service was held there in early December 2015, with a public memorial service occurring in late January 2016 across from Parliament Hill. The service was broadcast on CPAC, and among those who spoke were James Wolfensohn, Adrienne Clarkson, John Ralston Saul and Achim Steiner. Written tributes from Mikhail Gorbachev, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Kofi Annan were also sent.

==Impact==
While unremarkable in appearance, Strong was said to have &quot;an astonishing network&quot; that connected diverse interest groups. One observer described his &quot;scarcely-concealed delight in explaining his often Machiavellian political manoeuvrings.&quot;

In the environmental movement, he was instrumental in promoting government funding and entry into international meetings for environmental non-governmental organizations.

<text>The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, often shortened to Rio Declaration, was a short document produced at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), informally known as the Earth Summit. The Rio Declaration consisted of 27 principles intended to guide countries in future sustainable development. It was signed by over 175 countries.

==History==
The Rio Conference, which adopted the Declaration, took place from 3 to 14 June 1992. Subsequently, the international community has met twice to assess the progress made in implementing the principles of the document; first in New York City in 1997 during a General Assembly Session of the UN, and then in Johannesburg in 2002. While the document helped to raise environmental awareness, evidence from 2007 suggested that little of the document&#x27;s environmental goals had at that time been achieved.

== Content ==
Referring to the &quot;integral and interdependent nature of the Earth, &quot;our home&quot;, the Rio Declaration proclaims 27 principles. The first principle states that sustainable development primarily concerns human beings, who are entitled to live healthy and productive lives in harmony with nature. Article 11 creates an expectation that states will enact environmental legislation. Further articles include formulations of the precautionary principle, which should be &quot;widely applied by states according to their capabilities&quot; (principle 15), and of the polluter pays principle, which states are encouraged to adopt where it is in the public interest to do so and it will not distort international trade and investment (principle 16). The final principle invites fulfillment of the other principles in a spirit of good faith.

The Rio Declaration expresses a positive view of traditional ecological knowledge.

<doc id="441113" wikidata="Q864668" url="?curid=441113" title="Caithness">
<text>Caithness (; ; ) is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area of Scotland.

There are two towns, being Wick, which was the county town, and Thurso. The county includes the northernmost point of mainland Britain at Dunnet Head, and also the most north-easterly point at Duncansby Head near John o&#x27; Groats. The Flow Country is the largest blanket bog in Europe, and covers a large inland area in the west of the county. Caithness has a land boundary with the historic county of Sutherland to the west and is otherwise bounded by sea. The land boundary follows a watershed and is crossed by two roads (the A9 and the A836) and by one railway (the Far North Line). Across the Pentland Firth, ferries link Caithness with Orkney, and Caithness also has an airport at Wick. The Pentland Firth island of Stroma is within Caithness.

From the 9th century the Caithness area was ruled by the Jarl of Orkney, who at different times owed allegiance to both Norway and Scotland. Caithness subsequently became a separate provincial lordship from Orkney in the 14th century, being an earldom controlled by the Earl of Caithness. The name was also used for the Diocese of Caithness from the 12th century to the 17th century. The diocese was larger than the later county, also including Sutherland. A shire called Caithness covering the same area as the earldom was created in 1641, after a couple of earlier abortive attempts. Shires gradually eclipsed the old provinces in administrative importance, and also became known as counties.

The county ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975, when the area became part of the Highland region, which in turn became a single-tier council area in 1996. There was a local government district called Caithness from 1975 to 1996, which was a lower-tier district within the Highland region. The pre-1975 county boundaries are still used for certain functions, being a registration county.

The Norn language was historically the language of everyday communication for people in Caithness, but was gradually overtaken by Scots and then English. Norn had probably become extinct in Caithness by the 15th century.

==Toponymy==
The &quot;Caith&quot; element of the name &quot;Caithness&quot; comes from the name of a Pictish tribe known as the &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Catt&quot; or &quot;Catti&quot; people, whose Kingdom of Cat covered what would become Caithness and parts of Sutherland from the 9th century. The element comes from Old Norse and means &quot;headland&quot;. The Norse called the area (&quot;headland of the Catt people&quot;), and over time this became &quot;Caithness&quot;.

The Gaelic name for Caithness, , means &quot;among the strangers&quot;, referring to the Norse. The name of the Catti survives in the Gaelic name for eastern Sutherland, , and in the old Gaelic name for Shetland, .

==Geography==
Caithness extends about north-south and about east-west, with a roughly triangular-shaped area of about . The topography is generally flat, in contrast to the majority of the remainder of the North of Scotland. Until the latter part of the 20th century when large areas were planted in conifers, this level profile was rendered still more striking by the almost total absence of woodland.
It is a land of open, rolling farmland, moorland and scattered settlements. The county is fringed to the north and east by dramatic coastal scenery and is home to large, internationally important colonies of seabirds. The surrounding waters of the Pentland Firth and the North Sea hold a great diversity of marine life. Notable features of the north coast are Sandside Bay, Thurso Bay and Dunnet Bay, Dunnet Head (the northernmost point of Britain) and Duncansby Head (the north-east tip of Britain); along the east coast can be found Freswick Bay, Sinclairs Bay and Wick Bay. To the north in Pentland Firth lies Stroma, the only major island of the county. Away from the coast, the landscape is dominated by open moorland and blanket bog known as the Flow Country which is the largest expanse of blanket bog in Europe, extending into Sutherland. This is divided up along the &quot;straths&quot; (river valleys) by more fertile farm and croft land. In the far south the landscape is slightly hillier, culminating in Morven, the highest peak in the county at 706 m (2,316 ft).

The county contains a number of lochs, though these are smaller in comparison with the rest of northern Scotland. The most prominent are Loch Heilen, St. John&#x27;s Loch, Loch Watten, Loch More, Loch Shurrery, Loch Calder and Loch Mey.

The underlying geology of most of Caithness is Old Red Sandstone to an estimated depth of over . This consists of the cemented sediments of Lake Orcadie, which is believed to have stretched from Shetland to Grampian during the Devonian period, about 370 million years ago. Fossilised fish and plant remains are found between the layers of sediment. Older metamorphic rock is apparent in the Scaraben and Ord area, in the relatively high southwest area of the county. Caithness&#x27;s highest point (Morven) is in this area.

Because of the ease with which the sandstone splits to form large flat slabs (flagstone) it is an especially useful building material, and has been used as such since Neolithic times.

===Natural heritage===

Caithness is one of the Watsonian vice-counties, subdivisions of Britain and Ireland which are used largely for the purposes of biological recording and other scientific data-gathering. The vice-counties were introduced by Hewett Cottrell Watson, who first used them in the third volume of his &quot;&quot;, published in 1852.

The underlying geology, harsh climate, and long history of human occupation have shaped the natural heritage of Caithness. Today a diverse landscape incorporates both common and rare habitats and species, and Caithness provides a stronghold for many once common breeding species that have undergone serious declines elsewhere, such as waders, water voles, and flocks of overwintering birds.

Many rare mammals, birds, and fish have been sighted or caught in and around Caithness waters. Harbour porpoises, dolphins (including Risso&#x27;s, bottle-nosed, common, Atlantic white-sided, and white-beaked dolphins), and minke and long-finned pilot whales are regularly seen from the shore and boats. Both grey and common seals come close to the shore to feed, rest, and raise their pups; a significant population over-winters on small islands in the Thurso river only a short walk from the town centre. Otters can be seen close to river mouths in some of the quieter locations.

Much of the centre of Caithness is known as the Flow Country, a large, rolling expanse of peatland and wetland that is the largest expanse of blanket bog in Europe. Around of the Flow Country is protected as both a Special Protection Area (SPA) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the name Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands, and a portion is further designated as the Forsinard Flows national nature reserve.

In 2014 of the eastern coastline of Caithness between Helmsdale and Wick was declared a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area under the title East Caithness Cliffs. The cliffs are also designated as both a Special Protection Area and a Special Area of Conservation.

==History==
The Caithness landscape is rich with the remains of pre-historic occupation. These include the Grey Cairns of Camster, the Stone Lud, the Hill O Many Stanes, a complex of sites around Loch of Yarrows near Thrumster, and over 100 brochs. A prehistoric souterrain structure at Caithness has been likened to discoveries at Midgarth and on Shapinsay.

The study of Caithness prehistory is well represented in the county by groups including Yarrows Heritage Trust, Caithness Horizons and Caithness Broch Project.
Numerous coastal castles (now mostly ruins) are Norwegian (West Norse) in their foundations. When the Norsemen arrived, probably in the 10th century, the county was inhabited by the Picts, but with its culture subject to some Goidelic influence from the Celtic Church. The name Pentland Firth can be read as meaning Pictland Fjord.

Norse settlers landed in the county, and gradually established themselves around the coast. On the Latheron (south) side, they extended their settlements as far as Berriedale. Many of the names of places are Norse in origin. In addition, some Caithness surnames, such as Gunn, are Norse in origin.

The area was anciently part of the Pictish kingdom of Cat, which also included Sutherland. It was conquered in the 9th century by Sigurd Eysteinsson, Jarl of Orkney. The Jarls owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown. The Scottish crown claimed the overlordship of the Caithness and Sutherland area from Norway in 1098. The Earls of Orkney thereafter owed allegiance to the Scottish crown for their territory on the mainland, which they held as the Mormaer of Caithness, but owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown for Orkney itself.

The Diocese of Caithness was established in the 12th century. The bishop&#x27;s seat was initially at Halkirk, but in the early 13th century was moved to Dornoch Cathedral (now in Sutherland), which was begun in 1224.

Caithness became a separate earldom during the 14th century, under the feudal control of the Earl of Caithness. The title Earl of Caithness had sometimes been used by the mormaers who were also Jarls of Orkney; the earldoms had been separated by the time David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn was made Earl of Caithness, sometime between 1375 and 1377.

===Shire and county===
In terms of shires (areas where justice was administered by a sheriff), the north of mainland Scotland was all included in the shire of Inverness from the 12th century. In 1455 the Earl of Caithness gained a grant of the justiciary of the area, giving Caithness partial independence from the Sheriff of Inverness.

An act of parliament in 1504 acknowledged that the shire of Inverness was too big for the effective administration of justice, and so declared Ross and Caithness to be separate shires. The boundary used for the shire of Caithness created in 1504 was the diocese of Caithness, which included Sutherland. The Sheriff of Caithness was directed to hold courts at either Dornoch or Wick. That act was set aside for most purposes in 1509, and Caithness once more came under the sheriff of Inverness. The sheriff of Inverness was then directed to appoint a number of deputies, including one based in Wick. In 1584, George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness, forfeited the justiciary of the area after a dispute with George Gordon, Earl of Huntly, who was sheriff of Inverness at the time.

Caithness was restored to being a shire in 1641. The shire of Caithness created in 1641 just covered the earldom of Caithness; Sutherland had been made its own shire in 1633. Wick was declared to be the head burgh of the shire, and the Earl of Caithness became the hereditary sheriff.

Over time, Scotland&#x27;s shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term &#x27;county&#x27; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &#x27;shire&#x27;.

Following the Jacobite rising of 1745, the government passed the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746, returning the appointment of sheriffs to the crown in those cases where they had become hereditary positions, as had been the case in Caithness. From 1748 the government merged the positions of Sheriff of Sutherland and Sheriff of Caithness into a single post. Although they shared a sheriff after 1748, Caithness and Sutherland remained legally separate counties, having their own commissioners of supply and, from 1794, their own lord lieutenants.
Although Wick had been declared the head burgh of the shire in 1641, for much of the next 200 years the sheriff held most courts and had his clerk&#x27;s offices in Thurso. In 1828 a new Town and County Hall (now known as Wick Town Hall) was completed on Bridge Street in Wick, jointly funded by Wick Town Council and the county&#x27;s commissioners of supply. Whilst it was under construction, the Wick authorities took legal action against the sheriff, successfully securing an order requiring him to hold regular courts and have his clerk&#x27;s offices in Wick.

Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners of supply (which were eventually abolished in 1930). Caithness County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the Town and County Hall in Wick. The county council moved its administrative offices to the County Offices on High Street, Wick, in 1930, but continued to hold its meetings at the Town and County Hall.

The 1889 Act also led to a review of boundaries, with parish and county boundaries being adjusted to eliminate cases where parishes straddled county boundaries. The parish of Reay had straddled Sutherland and Caithness prior to the act; the county boundary was retained, but the part of Reay parish in Sutherland was transferred to the parish of Farr in 1891.

===Since 1975===

Local government was reformed in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Caithness became part of the Highland Region. At the district level there was a Caithness District, which initially covered the pre-1975 county plus the parishes of Farr and Tongue from Sutherland. The transfer of Farr and Tongue to Caithness district was not popular; less than two years later, in 1977, they were transferred to the Sutherland district, after which the district covered the same area as the pre-1975 county.

Caithness District Council was based at the former county council&#x27;s headquarters at the County Offices in Wick, and held its meetings alternating between Wick Town Hall and Thurso Town Hall. Throughout the district&#x27;s existence from 1975 to 1996, a majority of the seats were held by independent councillors.
Further local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with single-tier council areas. The former Highland region became one of the new council areas. The boundaries of the historic county are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county. The pre-1996 district (being the same area as the pre-1975 county) is also used as a lieutenancy area, served by the Lord Lieutenant of Caithness.

The Highland Council has an area committee called the Caithness Committee, comprising the councillors representing the wards which approximately cover the Caithness area. The council also marks the historic county boundaries with road signs.

==Parishes==
Parishes existed from medieval times. From 1845 to 1894 they had parish boards and from 1894 to 1930 they had parish councils. They have had no administrative functions since 1930, but continue to be used for the presentation of statistics.

Following the 1891 parish boundary changes, Caithness contained the following civil parishes:

*Bower
*Canisbay
*Dunnet
*Halkirk
*Latheron
*Olrig
*Reay
*Thurso (included burgh of same name)
*Watten
*Wick (included burgh of same name)
Halkirk was formed at the Reformation by the merger of the ancient parishes of Halkirk and Skinnet. Watten was created from part of Bower parish in 1638.

===Community councils===
Community councils were created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. They have no statutory powers, but serve as a representative body for their communities. The Highland Council designates community council areas, but a community council is only formed if there is sufficient interest from the residents. Since a review in 2019, Caithness has comprised the following communities, of which all except Bower have community councils operating as at 2024:

*Berriedale and Dunbeath
*Bower
*Caithness West
*Castletown
*Dunnet and Canisbay
*Halkirk
*Latheron, Lybster and Clyth
*Sinclair&#x27;s Bay
*Tannach and District
*Thurso
*Watten
*Wick
==Parliamentary constituency==
The Caithness constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain (1708 to 1801) and the Parliament of the United Kingdom (1801 to 1918) represented essentially the county from 1708 to 1918. At the same time however, the county town of Wick was represented as a component of Tain Burghs until 1832 and of Wick Burghs until 1918.

Between 1708 and 1832 the Caithness constituency was paired with Buteshire as &quot;alternating constituencies&quot;: one constituency elected a member of parliament (MP) to one parliament and then the other elected an MP to the next. Between 1832 and 1918 Caithness elected an MP to every parliament.

In 1918 the Caithness constituency and Wick were merged into the then new constituency of Caithness and Sutherland. In 1997 Caithness and Sutherland was merged into Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.

The Scottish Parliament constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was created in 1999 and now has boundaries slightly different from those of the House of Commons constituency. It was replaced by the larger constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross in 2011.

The modern constituencies may be seen as more sub-divisions of the Highland area than as representative of counties (and burghs). For its own purposes, however, the Highland Council uses more conservative sub-divisions, with names which refer back to the era of district councils and, in some cases, county councils.

In the Scottish Parliament Caithness is represented also as part of the Highlands and Islands electoral region.

==Towns and villages==

In 2021, Caithness had a resident population of 25,347 (26,486 in 2011).

There are two towns in Caithness: Thurso and Wick. 54% of the population live in one of those towns.

There are also a few villages large enough to have amenities such as a shop, a cafe, a post office, a hotel, a church or a bank. These include Castletown, Dunbeath, Dunnet, Halkirk, John o&#x27; Groats, Keiss, Lybster, Reay/New Reay, Scrabster and Watten.

==Transport==

Caithness is served by the Far North railway line, which runs west–east across the middle of the county serving Altnabreac and Scotscalder before splitting in two at Georgemas Junction, from where the east branch continues to Wick whilst the north branch terminates at Thurso.

Stagecoach Group provided bus transport between the major towns, and on to Inverness via Sutherland and Ross-shire.

The ferry port at Scrabster provides a regular service to Stromness in the Orkney Islands. Ferries also run from Gills Bay to St Margaret&#x27;s Hope on South Ronaldsay. A summer-only ferry runs from John o&#x27; Groats to Burwick on South Ronaldsay.

Wick Airport provided regular flights to Aberdeen and Edinburgh until 2020 when Loganair and Eastern Airways cancelled their flights. In 2021 there were no scheduled flights to and from Wick Airport. Starting on 11 April 2022, Eastern Airways started a scheduled operation to Wick from Aberdeen.

==Language==
At the beginning of recorded history, Caithness was inhabited by the Picts, whose language Pictish is thought to have been related to the Brythonic languages spoken by the Britons to the south. The Norn language was introduced to Caithness, Orkney, and Shetland by the Norse occupation, which is generally proposed to be c. AD 800. Although little is known of that Norn dialect, some of this linguistic influence still exists in parts of the county, particularly in place names. Norn continued to be spoken in Caithness until perhaps the 15th century. and lingered until the late 18th century in the Northern Isles.

It is sometimes erroneously claimed that Gaelic has never been spoken in Caithness, but this is a result of language shift to Scots, and then towards Standard Scottish English during recent centuries. The Gaelic name for the region, &quot;Gallaibh&quot;, translates as &quot;Land of the Gall (&quot;non-Gaels&quot;)&quot;, a name which reflects historic Norse rule. Gaelic speakers seem to first figure in the early stage of the Scandinavian colonisation of Caithness, gradually increasing in numerical significance from the 12th century onwards. Gaelic has survived, in a limited form, in western parts of the county.

Scots began supplanting Norn in the early 14th century at the time of the Wars of Scottish Independence. The emergent Northern Scots dialect became influenced by both Gaelic and Norn and is generally spoken in the lowlying land to the east of a line drawn from Clyth Ness to some west of Thurso. The dialect of Scots spoken in the neighbourhood of John o&#x27; Groats resembles to some extent that of Orkney. Since the 17th century, Standard Scottish English has increasingly been replacing both Gaelic and Scots.

Records showing what languages were spoken apparently do not exist from before 1706, but by that time, &quot;[I]f ye suppose a Parallel to the hypotenuse drawn from Week to Thurso, these on the Eastside of it speak most part English, and those on the Westside Irish; and the last have Ministers to preach to them in both languages.&quot; Similarly, it is stated at that time that there were &quot;Seven parishes [out of 10 or 11] in [the Presbytery of] Caithness where the Irish language is used.&quot;

As previously indicated, the language mix or boundary changed over time, but the &quot;New Statistical Record&quot; in 1841 says: &quot;On the eastern side of [the Burn of East Clyth] scarcely a word of Gaelic was either spoken or understood, and on the west side, English suffered the same fate&quot;. Other sources state:

* &quot;There are Seven parishes in [the Presbytery of] Caithness where the Irish language is used, viz. Thurso, Halkrig [Halkirk], Rhae [Reay], Lathrone [Latheron], Ffar [Farr], Week [Wick], Duirness [Durness]. But the people of Week understand English also.&quot; (Presbytery of Caithness, 1706)
* &quot;A presbytery minute of 1727 says of 1,600 people who had &#x27;come of age&#x27;, 1500 could speak Gaelic only, and a mere five could read. Gaelic at this time was the principal language in most parishes except Bower, Canisbay, Dunnet and Olrig&quot;.
* &quot;Persons with a knowledge of Gaelic in the County of Caithness (in 1911) are found to number 1,685, and to constitute 6.7 per cent of the entire population of three years of age and upwards. Of these 1,248 were born in Caithness, 273 in Sutherland, 77 in Ross &amp; Cromarty, and 87 elsewhere... By an examination of the age distribution of the Gaelic speakers, it is found that only 22 of them are less than 20 years of age.&quot;

According to the 2011 Scotland Census, 282 (1.1%) residents of Caithness age three and over can speak Gaelic while 466 (1.8%) have some facility with the language. The percentage figures are almost exactly the same as for all of Scotland (1.1% and 1.7%, respectively). Nearly half of all Gaelic speakers in the county live in Thurso civil parish. The town of Thurso hosts the only Gaelic-medium primary school unit in all of Caithness (see Language in Thurso).

The bilingual road sign policy of Highland Region Council has led to some controversy in the region. In 2008, eight of the ten Caithness representatives to the Highland Council tried to prevent the introduction of bilingual English-Gaelic road signs into the county. The first bilingual sign in Caithness was erected in 2012. In 2013, a bilingual road sign on the A99 road next to Wick Airport was damaged by gunfire within 24 hours of it being placed. Gaelic-speaking Councillor Alex MacLeod, at the time representing Landward Caithness in the Highland Council, referred to it as &quot;an extreme anti-Gaelic incident&quot;.

==Flag==

In 2016 a flag was adopted for Caithness, following a competition organised by the Highland Council. The winning design has a black background representing the county&#x27;s dark flagstone, with a Nordic cross in yellow and blue representing the area&#x27;s Norse heritage and the county&#x27;s coast. A galley with a raven on its sail appears in one quarter; this was a traditional symbol of the county and had appeared on the old county council&#x27;s coat of arms.

==Local media==

=== Newspapers ===

&quot;The John O&#x27;Groat Journal&quot; and &quot;The Caithness Courier&quot; are weekly newspapers published by Scottish Provincial Press Limited trading as North of Scotland Newspapers and using offices in Union Street, Wick (but with public reception via Cliff Road) and Olrig Street, Thurso.

News coverage tends to concentrate on the former counties of Caithness and Sutherland. &quot;The John O&#x27;Groat Journal&quot; is normally published on Fridays and &quot;The Caithness Courier&quot; on Wednesdays. The two papers share a website.

Historically, they have been independent newspapers, with the &quot;Groat&quot; as a Wick-centred paper and the &quot;Courier&quot; as a Thurso-centred paper. Even now, the &quot;Groat&quot; is archived in the public library in Wick, while the &quot;Courier&quot; is similarly archived in the library in Thurso. The &quot;Courier&quot; was printed, almost by hand, in a small shop in High Street, Thurso until the early 60&#x27;s by Mr Docherty and his daughter. The &quot;Courier&quot; traditionally covers that week&#x27;s cases at Wick Sheriff Court.

===Radio===
&quot;Caithness FM&quot; has been broadcasting since 1993 and the Orkney Commercial Radio, Superstation Orkney from Kirkwall from 2004 to 2014.

<text>The County of Moray, ( ) or Morayshire, called Elginshire until 1919, is a historic county in Scotland. The county town was Elgin. The historic county ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975. Since 1996 most of the historic county&#x27;s area has been included in the Moray council area. The historic county boundaries are still used for certain functions, being a registration county. There is also a Moray lieutenancy area, covering a slightly smaller area than the historic county. The historic county borders Nairnshire to the west, Inverness-shire to the south, and Banffshire to the east, and has a coast onto the Moray Firth to the north.

==History==

Moray was a province in the Middle Ages, covering a much larger area than the later county. It lay to the north of the Kingdom of Alba (early Scotland), sometimes functioning as a vassal of the Scottish crown, and at other times operating as a separate kingdom. Moray was finally absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland during the 12th century.
In order to secure the Scottish crown&#x27;s authority over the area, it was divided into shires, being areas administered by a sheriff. The old earldom of Moray was broadly split into the three shires of Elginshire, Nairnshire, and the mainland parts of Inverness-shire.

There is some evidence that these shires were established under David I (reigned 1124–1153), but the earliest documented Sheriff of Elgin was in the 13th century. There was also a short-lived shire centred on Forres, which in the early 14th century was grouped with Nairn, before later being united instead with Elgin. The shire of Elgin was therefore sometimes called the shire of &#x27;Elgin and Forres&#x27;.

The shire of Elgin, or Elginshire, was seen as the core of the old territory of Moray and so was informally sometimes called Moray or Morayshire. &#x27;Murrayshire&#x27; and &#x27;Morrowshire&#x27; were sometimes used historically as alternate spellings.

Over time, Scotland&#x27;s shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term &#x27;county&#x27; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &#x27;shire&#x27;.

There were occasional adjustments to county boundaries. For example, in 1870, an exclave of Inverness-shire (surrounded by Nairnshire, Elginshire and Banffshire), including Cromdale and Grantown-on-Spey, was transferred to Elginshire, while the Elginshire&#x27;s southern exclave around Abernethy and Duthil went to Inverness-shire.
Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The burgh of Elgin was deemed capable of providing its own county-level local government functions, and so it was excluded from the administrative area of the county council, although the county council still chose to base itself there. Elginshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the Old Courthouse (built 1837) which adjoined Elgin Sheriff Court. The Old Courthouse also served as the meeting place for the commissioners.

The 1889 Act also led to a review of boundaries, with exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parish and county boundaries being adjusted to eliminate cases where parishes straddled county boundaries. There were several such changes affecting the boundaries of Elginshire, notably absorbing three detached parts of Nairnshire which were surrounded by Elginshire.

At a meeting on 7 May 1919, Elginshire County Council voted to change the name of the county from the County of Elgin or Elginshire to Moray. The government responded by directing all departments to use Moray, but noted that the legal name would remain Elgin until such time as it could be changed by statute. The statutory change of name from Elgin to Moray eventually took place in 1947 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947.

Reforms in 1930 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 saw the burgh of Elgin brought within the administrative area of the county council, and merged the county councils of Moray and neighbouring Nairnshire for most purposes. The two county councils continued to be elected as separate bodies, but operated together as the &quot;Joint County Council of Moray and Nairn&quot;, serving the combined area of the two counties.

Moray County Council was initially based at the Old Courthouse adjoining Elgin Sheriff Court on the High Street in Elgin. By the 1930s it was too small and so was demolished and replaced by a new headquarters on the same site, called the &#x27;County Buildings&#x27;. Work began on the new building in 1938 but was paused due to the Second World War. The new building was eventually completed in 1952.

In 1975 the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 reorganised local government in Scotland into a two-tier system of regions and districts. The burgh of Grantown-on-Spey and district of Cromdale which surrounded it (which area had been in Inverness-shire prior to 1870), was included in the Badenoch and Strathspey district of the Highland region. The rest of the pre-1975 county of Moray was included in a new district called Moray in the Grampian region, which also took in significant territory from the western part of Banffshire.

In 1996 the Scottish local government system was reorganised again, this time into single-tier council areas. The Moray district became one of the new council areas. The boundaries of the pre-1975 county of Moray are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county. The pre-1975 county of Moray excluding Cromdale and Grantown-on-Spey also serves as a lieutenancy area.

== Coat of arms ==
Granted in 1927 by the Lord Lyon, Moray County Council&#x27;s coat-of-arms was: &quot;Quarterly: 1st and 4th Azure, three mullets argent; 2nd and 3rd Argent, three cushions gules within a tressure flory-counter-flory of the last.&quot; The motto was &quot;SUB SPE&quot;, Latin for &quot;In Hope&quot;, a pun on the River Spey, which flows through the county. The coat of arms, described by Thomas Innes of Learney, a future Lord Lyon, in the &quot;Elgin Courant&quot; of 6 May 1927 as &quot;the most beautiful county arms in Scotland&quot;, represented the clan Murray and Randolph, Earl of Moray, the two main landowners.

==Geography==

Moray consists of a flattish coastal section, containing the main towns, with a hilly interior, extending into the Grampian Mountains in the far south. Notable features of the coast are Findhorn Bay and the broad arc of Burghead Bay. The coast around Lossiemouth is somewhat rockier, and includes the small islands of Covesea Skerries and Halliman Skerries offshore.

There are several lochs in the county, none of which are particularly large. They include Loch Dallas, Loch Noir, the Lochs of Little Benshalag, Loch of the Cowlatt, Lochanan a&#x27; Ghiubhais, Loch an Salich, Loch Trevie, Loch Tutach, Loch Allan, Loch Stuart, Loch Mhic Leòid, Loch Ille Mhòr, Lochan Dubh, Loch nan Stuirteag, Loch an t-Sithein and Lochindorb.

==Settlements==
Prior to 1975, there were six burghs in the county. Burghs were abolished as part of the 1975 local government reforms. The burghs were:
*Burghead
*Elgin
*Forres
*Grantown-on-Spey
*Lossiemouth and Branderburgh
*Rothes

Other settlements include:

*Alves
*Archiestown
*Cromdale
*Cummingston
*Dallas
*Duffus
*Dyke
*Findhorn
*Fochabers
*Fogwatt
*Garmouth
*Hopeman
*Kellas
*Kingston on Spey
*Kinloss
*Kintessack
*Lhanbryde
*Longmorn
*Mosstodloch
*Rafford
*Urquhart

==Civil parishes==
Civil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time. From 1845 to 1930, parishes formed part of the local government system of Scotland, having parochial boards from 1845 to 1894.

In 1861 there were 15 civil parishes entirely in Moray:
# Alves
# Birnie
# Dallas
# Drainie
# Duffus
# Edinkillie (see List of listed buildings in Edinkillie, Moray)
# Elgin
# Forres
# Kinloss
# Knockando
# Lhanbryde
# Rafford
# Speymouth
# Spynie
# Urquhart

In 1861 Morayshire shared various civil parishes with three surrounding counties. Five with Banffshire:
# Bellie Fochabers
# Boharm
# Inveraven
# Keith
# Rothes

three with Inverness-shire:
# Abernethy
# Cromdale
# Duthill

and one with Nairnshire:
# Dyke

==Flag==

In 2023, the Lord Lieutenant of Moray organised a competition to design a flag for the lieutenancy area. The winning design is green, gold and blue, representing the area&#x27;s agriculture and links to the sea.

<text>Pauropoda is a class of small, pale, millipede-like arthropods in the subphylum Myriapoda. More than 900 species in twelve families are found worldwide, living in soil and leaf mold. Pauropods look like centipedes or millipedes and may be a sister group of the latter, but a close relationship with Symphyla has also been posited. The name Pauropoda derives from the Greek &quot;pauros&quot; (meaning small or few) and &quot;pous&quot; or &quot;podus&quot; (meaning foot), because most species in this class have only nine pairs of legs as adults, a smaller number than those found among adults in any other class of myriapods.

Pauropods are soft, cylindrical animals with bodies measuring only 0.3 to 2 mm in length. They have neither eyes nor hearts, although they do have sensory organs which can detect light. The body segments have ventral tracheal/spiracular pouches forming apodemes similar to those in millipedes and Symphyla, although the trachea usually connected to these structures are absent in most species. There are five pairs of long sensory hairs (trichobothria) located throughout the body segments. Pauropods can usually be identified because of their distinctive anal plate, which is unique to pauropods. Different species of pauropods can be identified based on the size and shape of their anal plate. The antennae are branching, biramous, and segmented, which is distinctive for the group. Pauropods are usually either white or brown.

== Discovery ==
The first pauropod species to be discovered and described was &quot;Pauropus huxleyi&quot;, found by Lord Avebury in his own garden in London in 1866. He wrote of the creature:&quot;Pauropus huxleyi&quot; is a bustling, active, neat and cleanly creature. It has, too, a look of cheerful intelligence, which forms a great contrast to the dull stupidity of the Diplopods, or the melancholy ferocity of most Chilopods.&#x27;In 1870, Packard discovered a species of North American pauropod, extending the group&#x27;s range.

==Evolution and systematics==
Only one fossil species has been reported: &quot;Eopauropus balticus&quot; a prehistoric species of pauropod that was found in Baltic Amber.

Pauropods are divided into two orders: Hexamerocerata and Tetramerocerata. Hexamerocerata contains only one family, Millotauropodidae, with a single genus and only eight species. Tetramerocerata is much larger and more diverse, with eleven families, including Pauropodidae, Brachypauropodidae, and Eurypauropodidae. The family Pauropodidae is especially large, with 27 genera and 814 species, including most of the genera and species in the class Pauropoda.

Adults in the order Tetramerocerata have a scarcely telescopic antennal stalk with four segments, five or six tergites, and eight to ten pairs of legs. Pauropods in this order are small (sometimes quite small) and white or brownish. Most species have nine pairs of legs as adults, but adults in four genera (&quot;Cauvetauropus&quot;, &quot;Aletopauropus&quot;, &quot;Zygopauropus&quot;, and &quot;Amphipauropus&quot;) have only eight pairs of legs, and adult females in the genus &quot;Decapauropus&quot; have either nine or ten pairs of legs. The order Tetramerocerata has a subcosmopolitan distribution.

Pauropods in the order Hexamerocerata have a strongly telescopic antennal stalk with six segments. Adults in this order have twelve tergites and eleven pairs of legs. The pauropods in this order are white and relatively long and large. The order Hexamerocerata has a mainly tropical range.

== Reproduction and development ==
Pauropods, like all other myriapods, are gonochoric. Male pauropods place small packets of sperm on the ground, which the females use to impregnate themselves. The females then deposit the fertilized eggs on the ground. Parthogenesis can occur in some species, especially when environmental conditions are unfavourable.

The embryo goes through a short pupoid stage before the egg hatches and the first larval instar emerges. Juveniles then develop into adults through a series of molts, adding legs at each stage. Juveniles in the order Tetramerocerata start with three pairs of legs and progress through instars with five, then six, and then eight leg pairs, and in most species, become adults with nine leg pairs. In contrast, the first instar in the order Hexamerocerata has six leg pairs of legs and becomes an adult with eleven leg pairs. In at least some species in each order, adults continue to molt but no longer add legs or segments. This mode of development is known as hemianamorphosis.

==Behavior and diet==
Paurapods have a distinctive method of movement characterized by bursts of speed and frequent changes of direction. Pauropods are shy of light and will attempt to distance themselves from it. Pauropods live in the soil, (usually at densities of less than 100 per square metre [9/sq ft]), and under debris and leaf litter. Pauropods occasionally migrate upwards or downwards throughout the soil based on moisture levels. They feed on mold, fungi, and occasionally even the root hairs of plants. As their bodies are too soft to be able to dig and burrow, pauropods follow roots and crevices in the soil, sometimes all the way down to the surface of the groundwater.

<text>Banffshire (; ; ) is a historic county in Scotland. The county town is Banff, although the largest settlement is Buckie to the west. The historic county ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975. Since 1996 the area has been split between the Aberdeenshire and Moray council areas. The historic county boundaries of Banffshire are still used for certain functions, being a registration county and lieutenancy area.

It borders the Moray Firth to the north, Moray and Inverness-shire to the west, and Aberdeenshire to the east and south.

==History==
Considerable evidence of prehistoric human habitation exists in the area, particularly near the coast. Examples include the cairn at Longman Hill and Cairn Lee, near the Burn of Myrehouse.
The area also includes the ruins of several medieval castles and the 12th century kirk of Gamrie.

Banffshire&#x27;s origins as a shire (the area administered by a sheriff) are obscure. There is some evidence that it was a shire from the time of David I (reigned 1124–1153), but the earliest documented Sheriff of Banff was in the 13th century.

The sheriff&#x27;s jurisdiction covered a number of provincial lordships which then existed between the larger provinces of Moray to the west and Buchan to the east. The lordships included Boyne and Enzie on the coast, plus the inland areas of Strathisla and several small lordships along the eastern side of the strath of the River Spey and its tributaries, including Glenlivet, Strathavon and Glenfiddich. The shire was long and thin; the main towns were generally in the wider part to the north near the coast, but the shire had a long, more sparsely populated, tail extending some along the Spey into the Grampian Mountains.

The boundaries of the older provinces were not always firmly defined, and some of the smaller provincial lordships were sometimes deemed to be subordinate to a larger province. Banffshire was sometimes said to include parts of the provinces of Moray and Buchan.

Over time, Scotland&#x27;s shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term &#x27;county&#x27; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &#x27;shire&#x27;.
Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). Banffshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at Banff Sheriff Court, the county&#x27;s main courthouse (built 1871) which also served as the meeting place for the commissioners.

The 1889 Act also led to a review of boundaries, with exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parish and county boundaries being adjusted to eliminate cases where parishes straddled county boundaries. There were several such changes affecting the boundaries of Banffshire. Prior to these boundary changes Banffshire included four detached parts surrounded by Aberdeenshire, the largest of which was the parish of St Fergus, and several parishes straddled the county boundaries. The boundary changes all took effect on 15 May 1891.

The county council initially established its offices at 8 Low Street, opposite the sheriff court. In 1934 it bought St Leonard&#x27;s House on Sandyhill Road in Banff, converting that to be its main offices instead. Council meetings continued to be held at the sheriff court.

In 1975 the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 reorganised local government in Scotland into a two-tier system of regions and districts. Banffshire was all included within the Grampian region, but the old county was split between two of the lower-tier districts. The north-east of Banffshire, including the town of Banff, went to the Banff and Buchan district. The west and south of Banffshire went to the new Moray district.

In 1996 the Scottish local government system was reorganised again, this time into single-tier council areas. The Moray district became one of the new council areas, whilst the Banff and Buchan district merged with Gordon and Kincardine and Deeside to become the new Aberdeenshire council area. The modern council areas of Moray and Aberdeenshire therefore cover different areas to the historic counties after which they are named.

The boundaries of the pre-1975 county of Banffshire are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county. The pre-1975 county of Banffshire also serves as a lieutenancy area.

==Geography==

Banffshire consists of a 30-mile stretch of coast along the Moray Firth from Spey Bay to Cullykhan Bay, the immediate hinterland, plus a long, tapering &#x27;tail&#x27; stretching inland some 55 or so miles, thus giving the county an elongated shape.

==Civil parishes==
Civil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.

From 1845 to 1930, parishes formed part of the local government system of Scotland, having parochial boards from 1845 to 1894 and parish councils from 1894 to 1930. Following the boundary changes of 1891, there were 21 parishes in Banffshire:

<text>The County of Bute (), also known as Buteshire, is a historic county and registration county of Scotland. Now replaced by Argyll and Bute for the Isle of Bute, with the Argyll and Bute Council. The Isle of Arran and The Cumbraes are now in North Ayrshire Council area. Since the implementation of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, on the 1 April 1996.

The former County of Bute comprised a number of islands in the Firth of Clyde, between the counties of Argyll and Ayrshire, the principal islands being Bute, Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae. The county town is Rothesay, located on the Isle of Bute. The County of Bute had its own elected county council from 1890 to 1975.

==History==
Buteshire was created as a shire (the area administered by a sheriff) by Robert II around 1385. Prior to that the islands in the Firth of Clyde had not formed part of any shire. The position of Sheriff of Bute was initially given to Robert&#x27;s illegitimate son, John Stewart, and subsequently passed to John&#x27;s descendants, who became the Earls of Bute in 1703.

Inherited sheriffdoms were abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746, after which sheriffs were appointed by the crown. The Sheriffs (Scotland) Act 1747 then placed Buteshire under a joint sheriff with neighbouring Argyll.

Meanwhile, in 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the Commissioners of Supply. The County of Bute Council was based at the Rothesay Town Hall and County Buildings at 31 High Street in Rothesay, which had been built in 1835 and served as the meeting place for Rothesay Town Council and the Commissioners of Supply, as well as being the courthouse for Buteshire.

The County of Bute was abolished for local government purposes in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts, with upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. The County of Bute was included in the Strathclyde region, with the Isle of Bute being placed in the Argyll district, and the Isle of Arran and the Cumbraes being placed in Cunninghame district. Strathclyde region was abolished in 1996 when the regions and districts were replaced by unitary council areas, with Argyll and Bute becoming a council area, and Cunninghame being renamed to become the North Ayrshire council area.

The County of Bute historic boundaries are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

==Geography==
The County of Bute consisted of two main islands in the Firth of Clyde separated by the Sound of Bute - Arran (also including the much smaller Holy Island, Hamilton Isle and Pladda off the south-east coast) and Bute (including the small isle of Inchmarnock off its west coast) - and also the Cumbraes between Bute and Ayrshire on the mainland, comprising Great Cumbrae, Little Cumbrae and the islets of The Eileans, Broad Islands, Castle Island and Trail Island.

Arran is Scotland&#x27;s 7th largest island and is a popular tourist destination, often referred to as &#x27;Scotland in miniature&#x27; due to the wide variety of scenery and geographical features that can be found here. The island is roughly peanut-shaped, being flatter in the south and more mountainous in the north, culminating in Goat Fell, the tallest mountain in Buteshire at 874 metres (2,866 ft). It is separated from the Kintyre Peninsula by the Kilbrannan Sound. Bute is in contrast is a much flatter though somewhat hilly island, especially in the north; it is separated from the Cowal Peninsula by the narrow Kyles of Bute. A number of lochs lie in the centre of the island, most notably Loch Fad, Loch Quien and Loch Ascog.

==Transport==

The Isle of Bute is connected by ferry to Wemyss Bay on the mainland; a ferry also connects the island with the Cowal Peninsula from the north-east of the island. An A-road runs along Bute&#x27;s east coast and loops around the island&#x27;s southern half; the northern half of the island is less well-served and can mostly only by traversed by foot or bike. Arran is also connected to the Scottish mainland by ferry; from the north one can reach Tarbert and Claonaig in Kintyre, and from Brodick ferries depart for Ardrossan in Ayrshire and Campbeltown further down the Kintyre Peninsula. A road goes around the edge of the island, with a B road cutting east–west across. A ferry also connects Great Cumbrae with Largs in Ayrshire. 
== Parliamentary constituency ==

There was a Buteshire constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1800 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. Between 1708 and 1832 it was an alternating constituency with Caithness: one constituency elected a Member of Parliament (MP) to one parliament then the other elected an MP to the next. Between 1832 and 1918 it was a separate constituency, electing an MP to every parliament.

The population of Buteshire in 1841 was 15,740.

In 1918 the constituency was combined with the Ayrshire North constituency to form the Bute and Northern Ayrshire constituency, a constituency which straddled the boundary between the local government counties of Bute and Ayrshire.

In 1983, eight years after Scottish local government counties had been abolished, the Bute and Northern Ayrshire constituency was divided between the Argyll and Bute constituency and the Cunninghame North constituency.

In 2005, both constituencies were enlarged as part of the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies. The name &quot;Argyll and Bute&quot; was retained, while the enlarged Cunningham North was renamed North Ayrshire and Arran.

Constituencies with similar boundaries to the pre-2005 constituencies, and also called Argyll and Bute and Cunninghame North, are used by the Scottish Parliament.

<text>Peeblesshire (), the County of Peebles or [[Tweeddale]] is a historic county of Scotland. Its county town is Peebles, and it borders Midlothian to the north, Selkirkshire to the east, Dumfriesshire to the south, and Lanarkshire to the west.

==History==
The origins of Peeblesshire are obscure, but it became a shire sometime around the twelfth century, covering part of the historic district or province of Tweeddale. The southern part of Tweeddale became the sheriffdom of Selkirkshire, also known as Ettrick Forest, whilst the northern part of Tweeddale was initially divided into two sheriffdoms, based at Peebles and Traquair, before those two were united as the single shire of Peebles, or Peeblesshire, around 1304. From then on the shires gradually became the more important areas for administration; the old provinces were not abolished as such, but their importance diminished.
Peeblesshire County Council was created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which established elected county councils across Scotland. The council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the courthouse on High Street in Peebles, also known as County Hall, which had been built in 1844–1848 as a sheriff court and meeting place for the Commissioners of Supply, the main administrative body for the county prior to the creation of the county council.
The county council continued to be based at the courthouse until 1935 when it moved to County Buildings on Rosetta Road in Peebles.

Peeblesshire County Council was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which reorganised local government in Scotland into upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Peeblesshire became part of the Borders region and Tweeddale district, the latter having the same boundaries as the pre-1975 county of Peeblesshire. The last lord-lieutenant for the county of Peeblesshire became the first Lord Lieutenant of Tweeddale.

The Borders region and its four districts, including Tweeddale, were abolished in 1996, merging to form the present Scottish Borders council area. The area of the pre-1996 Tweeddale district (and therefore the same area as pre-1975 Peeblesshire) continues to be used as a lieutenancy area under the name of Tweeddale.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the county, which was matriculated by the Lord Lyon in 1931, ia as follows: &quot;Quarterly, 1st sable five fraises (strawberry leaves) argent; 2nd azure, a horse&#x27;s head couped argent; 3rd vert, a fleece or; 4th or, fretty gules, on a chief embattled of the last, two thunderbolts of the first.&quot; The arms are supported by two salmon proper, and the crest is a Border cavalryman. The motto is &quot;ONWARD TWEEDDALE&quot;. The first quarter is the arms of Fraser of Oliver Castle, a prominent local laird; the second, that of Horsburgh, another prominent local laird; the third, a reference to the area&#x27;s wool industry; and the fourth, that of M. G. (later Sir Michael) Thorburn of Glenormiston, who was sheriff of Peebles at the time of the arms&#x27; matriculation.

==Geography==
The county is landlocked and forms part of the Southern Uplands geographic region of Scotland. There are few settlements and the county consists mostly of low hill country, including parts of the Pentland Hills and Moorfoot Hills, with the highest point being Broad Law at 840 m (2,760 ft). The river Tweed is the chief river, flowing in a crescent shape through the county. Bodies of water in Peeblesshire include the Baddinsgill Reservoir, West Water Reservoir and Portmore Loch in the north and the Megget Reservoir, Talla Reservoir and Fruid Reservoir in the south. 

==Transport==

The county was formerly served by the Peebles Railway and the Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway, however these lines closed in the 1950s-60s and there are now no active railways in the county.

<text>Coursework (also course work, especially British English) is work performed by students or trainees for the purpose of learning. Coursework may be specified and assigned by teachers, or by learning guides in self-taught courses. Coursework can encompass a wide range of activities, including practice, experimentation, research, and writing (e.g., dissertations, book reports, and essays). In the case of students at universities, high schools and middle schools, coursework is often graded and the scores are combined with those of separately assessed exams to determine overall course scores. In contrast to exams, students may be allotted several days or weeks to complete coursework, and are often allowed to use text books, notes, and the Internet for research.

In universities, students are usually required to perform coursework to broaden knowledge, enhance research skills, and demonstrate that they can discuss, reason and construct practical outcomes from learned theoretical knowledge. Sometimes coursework is performed by a group so that students can learn both how to work in groups and from each other.

==Plagiarism and other problems==
Plagiarism and copying can be problematic in graded coursework. Easily accessible websites have given students opportunities to copy ideas and even complete essays, and remain undetected despite measures to detect this. While coursework may give learners the chance to improve their grades, it also provides an opportunity to &quot;cheat the system&quot;. Also, there is often controversy regarding the type and amount of help students can receive while completing coursework. In most learning institutions, plagiarism or unreasonable coursework help may lead to coursework disqualification, student expulsion, or both.

=== UK GCSE coursework ===
Coursework was removed from UK GCSE courses and replaced by &quot;Controlled Assessment&quot;, much of which must be completed under exam conditions, without teacher assistance and with access to resources tightly controlled in order to reduce the possibility of cheating. However, this too has been largely removed and replaced by mainly exam-based assessment as part of a general GCSE reform.

<text>Symphylans, also known as garden centipedes or pseudocentipedes, are soil-dwelling arthropods of the class Symphyla in the subphylum Myriapoda. Symphylans resemble centipedes, but are very small, non-venomous, and may or may not form a clade with centipedes. More than 200 species are known worldwide.

Symphyla are primarily herbivores and detritus feeders living deep in the soil, under stones, in decaying wood, and in other moist places. They are rapid runners, can move quickly through the pores between soil particles, and are typically found from the surface down to a depth of about . They consume decaying vegetation, but can do considerable harm in an agricultural setting by consuming seeds, roots, and root hairs in cultivated soil. For example, the garden symphylan, &quot;Scutigerella immaculata&quot; can be a pest of crops. A species of &quot;Hanseniella&quot; has been recorded as a pest of sugar cane and pineapples in Queensland. A few species are found in trees and in caves. A species of &quot;Symphylella&quot; has been shown to be predominantly predatory, and some species are saprophagous.

== Description ==

Symphyla are small, cryptic myriapods without eyes and without pigment. The body is soft and generally long, divided into two body regions: head and trunk. An exceptional size is reached in &quot;Hanseniella magna&quot;, which attains lengths of 12-13 mm (0.5 in).

The head has long, segmented antennae, a postantennal organ, three pairs of mouthparts: mandibles, the long first maxillae, and the second pair of maxillae which are fused to form the lower lip or labium of the mouth. The antennae serve as sense organs. Disc-like organs of Tömösváry, which probably sense vibrations, are attached to the base of the antennae, as they are in centipedes.

The trunk comprises 14 segments, which is covered by microhairs on the lateral and ventral integument, and by a various number of dorsal tergal plates, from 15 in Scutigerella and Hanseniella, and up till 24 in Ribautiella, increasing the flexibility of the body. Legs are found on the first 12 segments. The 13th segment, which is fused with the 12th segment, bears a pair of spinnerets that resemble cerci, and the 14th segment has a pair of long sensory hairs (trichobothria). Around the anal opening there is a small telson. Symphylans have been reported as living up to four years, and moult throughout their life. Immature individuals have six or seven pairs of legs on hatching, but they add an additional pair at each moult until the adult instar, which usually has twelve pairs of legs. This mode of development is known as hemianamorphosis. Although most adult symphylans have twelve leg pairs, the first pair is absent or vestigial in some species (e.g., those in the genus &quot;Symphylella&quot;), so adults in some species have only eleven leg pairs. The species with 12 pairs are the only myriapods with actual legs on the first body segment, as the first pair of legs is modified into forcipules in centipedes, and in pauropods the segment is a reduced collum which bears ventrally a pair of small papillae, while in millipedes it&#x27;s a collum without any appendages at all. 

Symphylans have several features linking them to early insects, such as a labium (fused second maxillae), an identical number of head segments and certain features of their legs. Each pair of legs is associated with an eversible structure, called a &quot;coxal sac&quot;, that helps the animal absorb moisture, and a small stylus that may be sensory in function. Similar structures are found in the most primitive insects.
Symphylans breathe through a pair of spiracles on the sides of their head, and are the only arthropods with spiracle openings on the head. These are connected to a system of tracheae that branch through the head and the first three segments of the body only.

The genital openings are located on the fourth body segment, but the animals do not copulate. Instead, the male deposits 150 to 450 packages of sperm, or spermatophores, on small stalks. The female then picks these up in her mouth, which contains special pouches for storing the sperm. She then lays her eggs, and attaches them to the sides of crevices or to moss or lichen with her mouth, smearing the sperm over them as she does so. The eggs are laid in groups of eight to twelve.

The spinnerets produce secretions that turn into a silk-like thread. One fossil species, &quot;Symphylella patrickmuelleri,&quot; was found preserved in Burmese Amber releasing long threads of silk. The silk plays a role in reproduction: the male deposits up to 450 spermatophores on stalks of silk. Symphylans have also been reported releasing silk as a defense and to suspend themselves in the air.

==Fossil record and evolution==
The symphylan fossil record is poorly known, with only five species recorded, all placed in living genera. The oldest records of both families are found in Burmese amber from the middle Cretaceous, approximately 99 million years ago. As a result, both families are thought to have diverged before the end of the Mesozoic Era.

Despite their common name, morphological studies commonly place symphylans as more closely related to millipedes and pauropods than the centipedes, in the clade Progoneata. Molecular studies have shown conflicting results, with some supporting the Progoneata clade, others aligning symphylans with centipedes or other arthropods, although some are weakly supported. The clade is believed to be monophyletic.
