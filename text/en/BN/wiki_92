<text>Tonbridge and Malling is a local government district with borough status in Kent, England. The council is based at Kings Hill. The borough also includes the towns of Tonbridge and Snodland along with numerous villages including Aylesford, West Malling and surrounding rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Maidstone, Tunbridge Wells, Sevenoaks, Gravesham and Medway.

==Geography==
Tonbridge and Malling Borough covers an area from the North Downs at Burham and Snodland in the north to the town of Tonbridge in the south. The River Medway meanders north-east through the borough towards the Medway Gap, having in the west of the area received the River Eden. The Eden Valley Walk is also mostly in this borough.

==History==
===Ancient times===
The area has been occupied for thousands of years. The Neolithic people left behind much evidence: megaliths such as Kit&#x27;s Coty House at Aylesford and the Coldrum Stones at Trottiscliffe; and the Long barrows at Addington being examples. Bronze and Iron Age finds are also plentiful. There is evidence of the Romano-British civilisation along the Medway Valley.

The immediate district of Tonbridge is omitted from the Domesday Book; however most other settlements in the Borough are included. Castles were built at Tonbridge, Allington and West Malling in the 13th century. Religious houses: Malling, Aylesford and Tonbridge were built: one such was St Mary&#x27;s Abbey dating from 1092. Aylesford Priory on the banks of the Medway, was built in the 13th century.

There are surviving medieval manor houses including Ightham Mote and Old Soar Manor.

===19th century onwards===
====Description====
Kentish ragstone geologically speaking is the Upper Greensand Ridge, used in church building in Kent.

===Modern times===
The land included is mainly agricultural – orchards, and livestock in the main – although major business parks and buildings within coupled with the railways and the motorway means a majority of working residents commute to work in the more built-up villages and Tonbridge. The new settlement of Kings Hill can be regarded as tied in with the economy of Maidstone equally with that of parts of Kent further to the western extremity.

A remnant of the once flourishing hop-growing industry is provided by a tourist attraction at Beltring: once the &quot;Whitbread Hop Farm&quot;, it puts on weekend exhibitions and shows. Tonbridge and Malling has 27 listed buildings in the highest category of the national system, Grade I. This includes eight churches, five reduced structures left over from St Mary&#x27;s Abbey or Malling Abbey, West Malling and four manor houses, mostly built by lower social ranks than the titled nobility.
A diverse materials and appearance construction is Ightham Mote which is recognised in the highest category of the UK&#x27;s architecture listing system, Grade I, though no longer in private hands.
East Malling Research Station disseminates results of research into matters affecting horticultural crops, with particular emphasis on the fruit, hop and nursery stock industries.

Many of the villages are beside long-distance walks with tourist accommodation, enabling tours of the orchards and bluebell woods.

===Administrative history===
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the whole area of two former districts and part of a third, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*Malling Rural District
*Tonbridge Rural District (parishes of Hadlow and Hildenborough only, rest went to Tunbridge Wells)
*Tonbridge Urban District
The new district was named Tonbridge and Malling, combining the names of the former districts.

The district received borough status on 16 December 1983, changing the name of the council from Tonbridge and Malling District Council to Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council and allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
Since the 2023 election the council has been under no overall control, being led by a coalition of the Conservatives and the Independent Alliance.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Tonbridge and Malling. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1985 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===

Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council&#x27;s main offices are at the Gibson Building in Kings Hill, which had been built in 1939 as the officers&#x27; mess building of RAF West Malling. The building is named after Wing Commander Guy Gibson, known for leading the Dambusters Raid, who had been based at RAF West Malling in 1941–1942. The council moved to the Gibson Building in November 1974, just a few months after the council&#x27;s creation. A large extension to the Gibson Building was added in 2000. The council also has an office at Tonbridge Castle, which had been the offices of the former Tonbridge Urban District Council.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2023, the council has comprised 44 councillors elected from 19 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Wider politics===
In Parliament, the borough is covered by the Tonbridge, Maidstone and Malling and Chatham and Aylesford constituencies.

==Parishes==
Much of the district is covered by civil parishes, with the exception being the former Tonbridge Urban District, covering the town of Tonbridge, which is an unparished area. The parish council for Snodland takes the style &quot;town council&quot;.

==Transport==
Six railway routes operate through the borough.

The South Eastern Main Line on the route London – Tonbridge – Ashford International – Dover crosses the west of the borough with stations at Hildenborough and Tonbridge.

The Maidstone East Line on the route Victoria – Maidstone East – Ashford International – Canterbury – Thanet with its stations at Borough Green &amp; Wrotham, West Malling for Kings Hill, East Malling and Barming crosses the north of the borough.

From Tonbridge, the Hastings line services run to Tunbridge Wells and Hastings, with some through services from Hastings to London, and the Redhill to Tonbridge Line services run to Redhill: through services on that line to Guildford have been discontinued.

The High Speed 1 line with Eurostar services crosses the north of the borough, but there are no stations here, although southeastern high speed commuter services to / from London St Pancras call at Snodland during the morning and evening peak periods.

The Medway Valley Line links the North Kent Line at Strood with the South Eastern Main Line at Paddock Wood railway station. Stations are at Snodland, New Hythe, and Aylesford on the Strood – Maidstone West section of the line in the north of the borough and Wateringbury on the Maidstone West – Paddock Wood section of the line in the south of the borough. Beltring and Brandbridges Halt is close to the borough boundary. Trains on this line now run through from Paddock Wood to Tonbridge, but through services from Maidstone West via Strood to London Bridge have been discontinued.

The borough has road routes passing through it. There are three motorways: the M2, M20 and the M26; three west-east roads (A20; A21 and the A26 road). Three other roads of similar stature are the A227, A228 and A229.

In addition there are long distance footpaths, among them the Greensand Way, the Medway Valley Walk, the Wealdway and the Eden Valley Walk.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Tunbridge Wells and Bluebell Hill TV transmitters, BBC London and ITV London can also be received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitters.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Kent
*Heart South
*KMFM West Kent (covering Tonbridge)
*KMFM Maidstone (covering West Malling)

Local newspapers are &quot;Kent and Sussex Courier&quot; and &quot;Kent Messenger&quot;, which is published by the KM Group.

==Youth radio station==
Tonbridge and Malling has youth projects and organisations including Cupid FM, the first ever youth radio station or project of its kind within the area. The project received funding and support from Kent County Council and Tonbridge &amp; Malling Borough Council, and during 2006 set up a studio and online broadcast which came to a close in November of that year. The station was run by local teens and music was populated by the latest chart hits. 

==Mayors and chairmen==
The councillor presiding at council meetings was initially called the chairman until December 1983 when the council was awarded borough status and the role was renamed mayor. The existing chairman at that point, Barry Hughes, became the first mayor.

She ranks alongside Janet Morgan, Nicol David, Susan Devoy, Michelle Martin and Heather McKay as the sport&#x27;s greatest female players of all time.

==Career==
Fitz-Gerald was born in Melbourne, Australia, a hotspot for squash talent. In 1987, she won the female World Junior Championship and was the Australian Junior Female Athlete of the Year. It was also during this year that she represented Australia at the 1987 Women&#x27;s World Team Squash Championships, finishing runner-up to England. In 1992 she was selected once again to represent Australia in the 1992 Women&#x27;s World Team Squash Championships and this time Australia became the world champions. Remarkably, Fitzgerald would go on to win a total of seven World Team Championships.

She won numerous titles in the early 1990s, but 1996 proved to be her breakthrough year. She beat England&#x27;s Cassie Jackman in the World Open final. The next two years she beat the resurgent Michelle Martin in successive finals.

The next two years did not bring the same level of success, owing largely to knee surgery. In 2000, she lost an epic semi-final against Carol Owens. However, she came back in 2001 to beat New Zealand&#x27;s Leilani Joyce emphatically 9–0, 9–3, 9–2.

2002 saw her win her last World Open, beating Natalie Pohrer 10–8, 9–3, 7–9, 9–7. She also won a gold medal at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England.

In January 2004, Fitz-Gerald was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for her achievements and services to women&#x27;s squash, and the promotion of sport and a healthy lifestyle. She was Chairwoman and President of the Women&#x27;s International Squash Players Association from 1991 to 2002. In 2010, she was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

Fitz-Gerald announced her retirement from the Women&#x27;s International Squash Players Association (WISPA) world tour in February 2003.

In 2010, she came out of retirement to be part of the Australian team that won the gold medal at the 2010 Women&#x27;s World Team Squash Championships.

<text> (; ) is a Spanish-language daily newspaper in Spain. is based in the capital city of Madrid and it is owned by the Spanish media conglomerate PRISA.

It is the second-most circulated daily newspaper in Spain . is the most read newspaper in Spanish online and one of the Madrid dailies considered to be a national newspaper of record for Spain (along with &quot;El Mundo&quot; and &quot;ABC)&quot;. In 2018, its number of daily sales were 138,000.

==History==
 was founded in May 1976 by a team at PRISA which included Jesus de Polanco, José Ortega Spottorno and Carlos Mendo. The paper was designed by Reinhard Gade and Julio Alonso. It was first published on 4 May 1976, six months after the death of dictator Francisco Franco, and at the beginning of the Spanish transition to democracy. The first editor-in-chief of the daily was Juan Luis Cebrián.

 was the first pro-democracy newspaper within a context where all the other Spanish newspapers were influenced by Franco&#x27;s ideology. The circulation of the paper was 116,600 copies in its first year. It rose to 138,000 copies in 1977.

In 1978, suffered a far-right terrorist attack due to political upheaval. Four people were injured, two greatly, and one died. The building also suffered structural damage.

 filled a gap in the market and became the newspaper of Spanish democracy, for which role was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Communication and the Humanities in 1983, at a time when the transition from Franco&#x27;s dictatorship to democracy was still developing. The paper&#x27;s first Director (until 1988) was Juan Luis Cebrián, who came from the daily newspaper &quot;Informaciones&quot;. Like many other Spanish journalists of the time he had worked for &quot;Diario Pueblo&quot; (meaning &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in English) which was a mouthpiece for the Francoist .

Its reputation as a bastion of Spanish democracy was established during the attempted coup d&#x27;état by Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero of the Guardia Civil on 23 February 1981. During the uncertain situation of the night of 23 February 1981, when all members of parliament were held hostage in the Congress building and with tanks on the streets of Valencia, and before the state television station could transmit a speech by King Juan Carlos I condemning the coup, published a special edition of the newspaper called &#x27;, for the Constitution&#x27;. It was the first available daily paper during the situation with a pro-democracy position. It called on citizens to demonstrate in favor of democracy, and was widely discussed in the news media so much so that the director of , Juan Luis Cebrián, called the then director of &quot;Diario 16&quot;, Pedro J. Ramírez, in order to propose that both newspapers work on a joint pro-democracy publication; Ramírez refused, claiming that he would prefer to wait a few hours to see how the situation developed. &quot;Diario 16&quot; was not published until after a television broadcast by the king. Along with its commitment to democracy before the attempted coup of 23 February 1981, the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s election victory in 1982 with an absolute majority and its open support for the government of Felipe González, meant that consolidated its position during the 1980s as the Spanish newspaper with the most sales ahead of the conservative leaning &quot;ABC&quot;.

In 1986, was the recipient of the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Speech by the Roosevelt Institute.

In 1987, received the largest amount of state aid.

It was also the first Spanish daily to create the role of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Advocate,&quot; and the first to publish a &quot;Style Guide&quot;, that has since become a quality benchmark among journalists. has also established a number of collaborative agreements with other European newspapers with a social democrat viewpoint. In 1989, participated in the creation of a common network of information resources with in Italy and in France.

At the beginning of the 1990s, had to face a new political and journalistic challenge. The increasing political tensions caused by corruption scandals involving the socialist government of Felipe González polarized both the Spanish political classes and the press of the left and right wings. Since that time both the Partido Popular and the media aligned with it have accused and the other companies owned by PRISA. along with Sogecable of supporting the interests of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). Despite this, has managed to maintain its position as the best selling generalist daily in Spain, although its lead over &quot;El Mundo&quot; has been reduced.

The day of the attacks, then prime minister José María Aznar, from the ruling conservative party called editor in chief Jesús Ceberio and gave him assurances that the attacks had been planned and executed by the Basque terrorist group ETA.

Most pages contain five columns arranged in a neat, clear manner with distinct journalistic sub-categories. Photographs and graphics play a secondary, supporting role to the written word. The newspaper had had the same design from its foundation until the end of 2007, with little change (it previously used only black-and-white (monochrome) photographs, although the current format includes color photographs and more imaginative design, mainly in the varied supplements), and the same Times Roman font.

The newspaper&#x27;s format was revamped on 21 October 2007 with changes to its printed form, its digital presence on the Internet and the replacement of its historical motto &#x27;Independent morning daily&#x27; with &#x27;Global Spanish language newspaper&#x27;.

After taking this decision &quot;El País digital&quot; was suspended in 2002 by the Oficina de Justificación de la Difusión for four months because of two serious breaches of OJD regulations. The &quot;El País digital&quot; website opened again on 3 June 2005 with free access to the majority of the contents.

<text>Expert determination is a historically accepted form of dispute resolution invoked when there is not a &quot;formulated dispute&quot; in which the parties have defined positions that need to be subjected to arbitration, but rather both parties are in agreement that there is a need for an evaluation.

== Process ==
Expert determination is described as a procedure by which the parties to a dispute (e.g. technical, scientific, or business dispute) appoint an independent and neutral expert to determine the dispute in private. Like arbitration, it allows trade secrets and other sensitive information to be kept out of the public domain. The expert will be a person with specialist or technical knowledge relevant to the dispute. His experience and professional knowledge are expected to help solve the dispute since legal arbitrators or the arbitral tribunal are often unable to resolve technical issues even with the help of expert witnesses. Unlike arbitration, not all of the evidence an expert considers must be presented at a hearing in the presence of the parties.

The practice itself is well established where complex legal institutions either have not developed, or are unavailable, such as tribal societies and criminal organisations.

In the context of modern jurisprudence, the word &quot;expert&quot; appears first in &quot;Bottomley v Ambler&quot; 1878 38 LT 545, this was however used ambiguously also referring to arbitrators having the qualification of expert. The first mention that distinguishes specifically against the practise of arbitration, and introduces the formula &quot;as an expert and not as an arbitrator&quot; was in &quot;Dean v. Prince&quot; 1953 Ch. 590 at 591 (misquoted) and subsequently on appeal in the year 1954 1 Ch. 409 at 415. In Contract Law, the parties are free to include a forum selection clause appointing a special referee to resolve specialised but disputed factual issues between them.

The so-called dispute boards, which are commonly used in resolving construction contract disputes, are considered a specialized form of expert determination.

<doc id="444416" wikidata="Q636846" url="?curid=444416" title="Leydig cell">
<text>Leydig cells, also known as interstitial cells of the testes and interstitial cells of Leydig, are found adjacent to the seminiferous tubules in the testicle and produce testosterone in the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH). They are polyhedral in shape and have a large, prominent nucleus, an eosinophilic cytoplasm, and numerous lipid-filled vesicles.

While Leydig cells are predominantly associated with testosterone production in the male testes, recent studies have revealed their presence and role in the ovaries of females. These cells, located in the ovarian interstitial tissue, contribute to the production of androgens, including testosterone, which plays a significant role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, ovulation, and overall reproductive health in women. The activity of Leydig cells is particularly important in conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where excess androgen production can lead to symptoms such as hirsutism, acne, and infertility. 

==Structure==
The mammalian Leydig cell is a polyhedral epithelioid cell with a single eccentrically located ovoid nucleus. The nucleus contains one to three prominent nucleoli and large amounts of dark-staining peripheral heterochromatin. The acidophilic cytoplasm usually contains numerous membrane-bound lipid droplets and large amounts of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Besides the abundance of SER with scattered patches of rough endoplasmic reticulum, several mitochondria are also prominent within the cytoplasm. Reinke crystals have lipofuscin pigment and rod-shaped crystal-like structures 3 to 20 micrometres in diameter.

Adult-type Leydig cells differentiate in the post-natal testis and are dormant until puberty. They are preceded in the testis by a population of fetal-type Leydig cells from the 8th to the 20th week of gestation, which produce enough testosterone for masculinisation of a male fetus.

==Androgen production==
Leydig cells release a class of hormones called androgens (19-carbon steroids). They secrete testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), when stimulated by the luteinizing hormone (LH), which is released from the anterior pituitary in response to gonadotropin releasing hormone which in turn is released by the hypothalamus.

LH binds to its receptor (LHCGR) which is a G-protein coupled receptor and consequently increases the production of cAMP. cAMP, in turn through protein kinase A activation, stimulates cholesterol translocation from intracellular sources (primarily the plasma membrane and intracellular stores) to the mitochondria, firstly to the outer mitochondrial membrane and then cholesterol needs to be translocated to the inner mitochondrial membrane by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which is the rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis. This is followed by pregnenolone formation from the translocated cholesterol via the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, eventually leading to testosterone synthesis and secretion by Leydig cells.

In rats, prolactin (PRL) increases the response of Leydig cells to LH by increasing the number of LH receptors expressed on Leydig cells.

==Clinical significance==

Leydig cells may grow uncontrollably and form a Leydig cell tumour. These may be hormonally active, i.e. secrete testosterone. The function of Reinke crystals is unknown, but they appear in the case of Leydig cell tumours. They are found in less than half of all Leydig cell tumors, but when present, they may serve to confirm the diagnosis of a Leydig cell tumor. No other interstitial cell within the testes has a nucleus or cytoplasm with these characteristics, making identification relatively easy.

While any age is susceptible to a Leydig cell tumour, Leydig cell tumours are more common in people aged 5 to 10 and 30 to 35. A Leydig cell tumour in a child usually causes precocious puberty. About 10% of boys with the tumour have gynecomastia. Although a Leydig cell tumour is always benign in children, it is malignant in 10% to 15% of adults. It is the most common testicular cancer of non-germ cell origin.

Sonography may be used to identify cystic areas, but it is unable to tell benign tumours apart from malignant tumours.

Adrenomyeloneuropathy is another example of a disease affecting the Leydig cell. In this case, a person&#x27;s testosterone may fall despite higher-than-normal levels of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

==Etymology==
Leydig cells are named after the German anatomist Franz Leydig, who discovered them in 1850.

<text>Zeibekiko (, ) is a Greek folk dance, similar to Turkish Zeybek dance.

==Origin and history==

It takes its name from the Zeybeks, an irregular militia living in the Aegean Region of the Ottoman Empire from late 17th to early 20th centuries. It was first seen at the end of the 17th century in cities such as Constantinople and Smyrna. Evliya Çelebi mentions in his writings that it was danced in Magnesia and in Aydın at local feasts. Originally a dance for two armed people facing one another, it developed into an improvised dance for a single male.

After the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1922, the dance became popular also in mainland Greece, in many songs of &quot;Laiko&quot; music.

==Characteristics==

The Zeibekiko usually has a rhythmic pattern of or else . It is most commonly broken down as:

&lt;score&gt;
 \new DrumStaff \with{
 \override StaffSymbol.line-count = #1
 \drummode {
 \time 9/8 {
 cl8[ cl16 cl16] cl8[ cl8] cl8[ cl16 cl16] cl8 cl8 cl8
 }
&lt;/score&gt;

or as:

&lt;score&gt;
 \new DrumStaff \with{
 \override StaffSymbol.line-count = #1
 \drummode {
 \time 9/8 {
 cl16[ cl8 cl16] cl8[ cl8] cl16[ cl8 cl16] cl8 cl8 cl8
 }
&lt;/score&gt;

As a solo dance, it was traditionally performed by men, though it is now common for women to dance the Zeibekiko. Due to the movements of the dancer, it is sometimes known as the &quot;eagle dance&quot;. The dance has no set steps, only certain figures and a circular movement. It takes place in an area little surpassing one square metre and mostly consists of improvised movements.

Occasionally dancers perform feats such as standing on a glass of wine or a chair or fireplace, or picking up a table, adding a sense of a little and humor.

<text> (acronym TVE, branded tve, &quot;Spanish Television&quot;) is Spain&#x27;s national state-owned public television broadcaster and the oldest regular television service in the country. It was also the first regular television service in Equatorial Guinea.

TVE began as a standalone company dependent on the Ministry of Information and Tourism. After undergoing several restructurings and reorganizations, since 1 January 2007 it is the television division –while (RNE) is the radio division– of (RTVE), the public corporation which has the overall responsibility for the national broadcasting public services under a parliament-appointed president who, in addition to being answerable to a board of directors, reports to an all-party committee of the national parliament, as provided for in the Public Radio and Television Law of 2006.

TVE launched its first channel on 28 October 1956 as the first regular television service in Spain. It was the only one for a decade, until 15 November 1966, when TVE launched a second channel. As TVE held a monopoly on television broadcasting in the country, they were the only television channels until the first regional public television station was launched on 16 February 1983, when started broadcasting in the Basque Country. Commercial television was launched on 25 January 1990, when started broadcasting nationwide. On 20 July 1968, TVE also became the first regular television service in Equatorial Guinea, with the inauguration of its broadcasts in the then-Spanish autonomous region of Equatorial Guinea.

Its headquarters and main production centre is in Pozuelo de Alarcón, with additional production centres in San Cugat del Vallés and in the Canary Islands. TVE&#x27;s news services are located at its Torrespaña facilities, at the foot of the broadcasting tower in Madrid. Although almost all the programming of its channels is in Spanish and is the same for all of Spain, TVE has territorial centers in every autonomous community and produces and broadcasts some local programming in regional variations in each of them in the corresponding co-official language.

TVE&#x27;s activities were previously financed by a combination of advertising revenue and subsidies from the national government, but since 1 January 2010, it has been supported by subsidies only.

== History ==
=== 1950s ===
 was established at a building of in Madrid, and after some time of technical tests, its free-to-air black-and-white fullscreen standard-definition monaural live analogue terrestrial television transmissions on VHF frequencies were officially launched on 28 October 1956 with a special inaugural program. The next day, three evening hours a day of regular live broadcasting began from its single studio, becoming the first regular television service in Spain. At that time, there were only 600 receivers in operation in the city and the coverage barely reached a radius of .

An initial news bulletin, called , was created within a week and a weather forecast was first aired on 2 November 1956. On 13 January 1957, the first fiction was produced, an adaptation of the 1916 one-act play &quot;Before Breakfast&quot; by American playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and in February 1957, the first fiction series, the sitcom . On 15 September 1957, the evening edition of the flagship newscast was premiered, with the afternoon edition following on 28 April 1958.

On 27 April 1958, TVE aired its first live broadcast from out-of-studio, the 1957–58 La Liga season football match between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid CF from the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. On 12 October 1958, the broadcasting centre in Zaragoza was inaugurated and on the first week of February 1959, the broadcasting center in Barcelona began to operate. On 14 July 1959, the Miramar studios in Barcelona were opened.

=== 1960s ===
The first TVE production for abroad was the coverage for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) of the arrival in Madrid of the President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower on 21 December 1959. As the link with the Eurovision telecommunications network was not ready yet, it was taped and sent by plane to the nearest Eurovision node in Marseille. Once the link was ready, the first live broadcast from Spain to abroad was the 1959–60 European Cup season football match between Real Madrid and OGC Nice from the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid on 2 March 1960 through it. The first live broadcast from abroad to Spain was the second half of the European Cup final match between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt from Hampden Park in Glasgow on 18 May 1960 through Eurovision. The first full live coverage from abroad to Spain was the Wedding of Baudouin of Belgium and Fabiola de Mora y Aragón from Brussels on 15 December 1960, also through Eurovision. TVE took part in the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in its on 18 March 1961 in Cannes, with the song &quot;&quot; by Conchita Bautista.

On 12 February 1964, the production center in Las Palmas was opened to serve the Canary Islands. On 18 July 1964, in Pozuelo de Alarcón was inaugurated to replace the facilities at . It was opened with three studios already in operation and another six studios under construction. Studio 1 had an area of , which made it the largest television studio in Europe at the time. Shows and fiction production was soon transferred there, but the news services were not transferred until 1967. In August 1966, the first permanent foreign correspondent was stationed in London, followed in 1968 by the ones in New York, Vienna, and Brussels. On 15 November 1966 its second channel was launched on UHF frequencies.

TVE participated in the production of &quot;Our World&quot; television special with thirteen other national broadcasters from around the world coordinated by the EBU. This was the first live multinational multi-satellite television production ever and it was transmitted to twenty-four countries, including Spain, on 25 June 1967. TVE contributed with a segment, live on board some fishing vessels sailing in the Gulf of Cádiz, showing the work of the fishermen and praising the country&#x27;s fishing industry.

Televisión Española became also the first regular television service in Equatorial Guinea on 20 July 1968 when it inaugurated its production center at Santa Isabel de Fernando Po, in the then-Spanish autonomous region of Equatorial Guinea, and began broadcasts. Since there was no television link with peninsular Spain, the programming consisted of programs made locally and programs received from on tape. From its antenna located above sea level atop Pico de Santa Isabel, the broadcasts reached the mainland province of Río Muni and the neighboring countries Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon. After the country declared independence on 12 October 1968, the new authorities accused it of broadcasting &quot;racist programming&quot; and &quot;imperialist propaganda&quot;, and TVE ended up closing the station. Shortly after they resumed their broadcasts as (TVGE) but they ceased broadcasting definitively in 1973 and the few remaining Spanish technicians left the country. The Equatoguinean government re-established TVGE in 1979.

On 29 March 1969, TVE carried out the largest own-produced event until then, the 14h edition of the Eurovision Song Contest live from the Teatro Real in Madrid, following at the with the song &quot;La, la, la&quot; by Massiel. It was the second Eurovision Song Contest transmitted in full color, and since TVE did not have the required color equipment at the time, it had to rent it abroad. In Spain itself, the domestic broadcast and the copy that TVE kept in its archives was in black-and-white. The event was transmitted live to the EBU member broadcasters through the Eurovision network, to the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) member broadcasters through the Intervision network and to broadcasters in Chile, Puerto Rico, and Brazil via satellite. TVE won this edition with &quot;&quot; by Salomé, being the first time that a participant broadcaster wins twice in a row. This was a joint victory of four participants, because there was a tie for first place and there was no rule to break the tie, and it is the last time that Spain has won the competition to date.

=== 1970s ===

On 25 April 1971, the production center in the Canary Islands, which until then had operated autonomously, began to broadcast to the archipelago the live signal of TVE&#x27;s first channel received from through the recently launched Intelsat IV F-2 satellite. With this, the coverage of the first channel reached almost the entire territory of Spain while the second channel was only reaching the metropolitan areas of the main capitals. On 24 May 1971, the first delegation was opened in Bilbao, followed by the ones in Santiago de Compostela on 25 July 1971, and in Seville on 29 July 1971, which would later become the first territorial centers.

After two years of test transmissions, regular PAL color transmissions started in August 1972 with the Summer Olympics in Munich, with all programming transmitted in color in 1977 and color commercials starting in 1978. A colour test card designed exclusively for TVE by Finn Hendil, under the supervision of Erik Helmer Nielsen from Philips, replaced its previous black-and-white card developed by Eduardo Gavilán.

On 25 November 1972, TVE produced the very first edition of the annual OTI Festival live from the auditorium in Madrid. The event was transmitted live to the (OTI) member broadcasters via satellite. TVE also produced the sixth edition from the on 12 November 1977, the 14h edition from in Seville on 21 September 1985, and the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd editions from in Valencia on 5 December 1992, 9 October 1993, and 14–15 October 1994 respectively. TVE won the competition six times: in 1976 with the song &quot; by María Ostiz, in 1981 with &quot; by Francisco, in 1992 with &quot; by Francisco, in 1993 with &quot; by Ana Reverte, in 1995 with &quot; by Marcos Llunas, and in 1996 with &quot; by Anabel Russ.

Between 1977 and 1983, TVE produced the weekly variety show with the support of OTI. The show was broadcast in Spain and transmitted to the Spanish-language OTI member broadcasters via satellite. It was also broadcast on Spanish-language stations in the Philippines and the Netherlands Antilles.

=== 1980s ===
On 23 February 1981, Televisión Española was recording the roll-call vote for the investiture of the country&#x27;s next Prime Minister at the Congress of Deputies plenary hall when 200 armed Civil Guard officers broke into the building in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. The assailants immediately disabled the television cameras by force, but a TVE operator, Pedro Francisco Martín, managed to continue transmitting from one of the four cameras without their noticing. was receiving the transmission through an internal closed circuit and half an hour of the incident was recorded. Fernando Castedo, General Director of RTVE, hid the tape with the footage inside his chair&#x27;s cushion and sat on it when some military rebels took for more than one hour. As soon as they left, he sent two camera crews to the Palace of Zarzuela to record the King&#x27;s speech repudiating the coup. Each crew returned to with a copy of the speech in a different car and by different route, escorted by the Royal Guard, and it was broadcast as soon as they arrived. The footage of the assault inside the Congress was not aired until all the deputies were released after the failure of the coup the following day.

TVE was in charge of producing the official live television feed of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which allowed it to carry out a major modernization with the construction of the Torrespaña broadcasting tower in Madrid and the production center at its foot, which served as International Broadcast Centre during the event, both inaugurated on 7 June 1982. On 27 June 1983, a new production center in Sant Cugat del Vallès replaced the Miramar studios in Barcelona. Also in 1983, the central news services moved to the Torrespaña production center and ever since 14 November, has been broadcast from there.

Between 1985 and 1999, TVE took part in the biannual Eurovision Young Dancers competition, being the most successful participant by winning with five of its eight entrants. the on 16 June 1985 with Arantxa Argüelles, the on 5 June 1991 with Amaya Iglesias, the on 13–15 June 1993 with Zenaida Yanowsky, the on 3–6 June 1995 with Jesús Pastor Sauquillo and Ruth Miró Salvador, and the on 11–17 June 1997 with Antonio Carmena San José. Between 1988 and 2000, in the biannual Eurovision Young Musicians competition.
On 13 January 1986, weekdays breakfast television broadcasts began. On 16 May 1988, the teletext was incorporated to the broadcast signal, which allowed closed captioning to begin in November 1990. On 12 September 1988, TVE opened Estudios Buñuel in Madrid with three studios, one of them being the largest television studio in Europe at the time with an area of , which were in operation until 30 July 2015.

TVE participated in the 19th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd seasons of the international competition with mixed teams from towns across the country. A team from Jaca won the 21st season in summer 1990, and a team from Seville was the runner-up of the 19th season in summer 1988. TVE hosted at the grounds of the heats four and eight of the 19th season on 6 and 9 July 1988, and the heats three and eight of the 22nd season on 25 and 29 June 1991. 

On 19 May 1989, in response to the European Economic Community (EEC) requirement to separate the natural monopoly of infrastructure management from the competitive operations of running services, and with the imminent arrival of commercial television, TVE&#x27;s broadcasting network, including the Torrespaña tower, was transferred to Retevisión. While it was already appearing on certain live broadcasts as early as 1982, it was not until November 1989 that the logo bug appeared permanently at the bottom right corner of the screen on its both channels, except during commercials.

=== 1990s ===
For the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics the Organizing Committee created a host broadcaster expressly, (RTO&#x27;92), in order to guarantee that the international signal was produced objectively and impartially. RTO&#x27;92 managed the staff and the production and technical resources hired to RTVE, the (CCRTV), and the EBU. With a workforce of 3,083 people –of which 800 were from TVE–, and over fifty mobile units –fifteen from TVE–, RTO&#x27;92 provided live coverage of all Summer Olympic sports for the first time ever –except for a few preliminary events–, some 2,800 hours of live television footage, to its international rights-holders. Additionally, 500 TVE workers and eight mobile units were in charge of producing TVE&#x27;s personalized coverage, with La 2 dedicating all its programming exclusively to the Games 24 hours a day. For Catalonia, TVE and (TVC) joined forces to broadcast the Games also in Catalan, creating the , a 24 hours channel in Catalan dedicated exclusively to the Games that occupied TVC&#x27;s Canal 33 frequency.

The 1992 Olympics were also the first in which a comprehensive coverage in high-definition television (HDTV) was attempted. The European HDTV broadcast of the Summer Olympics was managed by the joint venture &quot;Barcelona 1250&quot; created by RTO&#x27;92, RTVE, Retevisión, and PESA, with the financial support of the EEC and a workforce of over 300 production and technical staff. TVE was in charge of the planning and lay-out of the technical facilities, all the engineering and the provision of qualified personnel. A total of 225 hours and 45 minutes was broadcast in analog HD-MAC standard in 1,250 lines and 16:9 aspect ratio, with commentary in five languages –Spanish, English, French, German, and Italian– in addition to the non-commentary sound track, of eighteen different sports at seventeen venues, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Events from five venues were covered live –80% of the total broadcast time– and other events were recorded for a delayed broadcast. On-screen text and graphics were shown in HDTV for the first time ever. Nearly 700 viewing sites installed throughout Europe, including the fifty HDTV receivers installed in various pavilions at the Seville Universal Exposition, were able to receive the broadcast.

On 1 December 1989 TVE international television service, on 12 February 1994 an all-sports channel, and on 15 September 1997 an all-news channel were launched. In 1993, stereophonic sound and a sound multiplex for the original language in foreign productions began to be available in the broadcast signal.

=== 2000s to present day ===
On 8 August 2008, regular test digital high-definition television transmissions started on TVE HD in 720p with the Summer Olympics in Beijing. On 1 January 2010, TVE dropped broadcasting commercial advertising on all its channels, with only self-promotions, institutional campaigns, and sponsorships allowed. With analog service discontinued on 3 April 2010, all its terrestrial free-to-air channels have only been available through the digital terrestrial television (DTT) ever since. On 31 December 2013, the first regular HDTV DTT channels were launched, simulcasting La 1 and Teledeporte, initially in 720p and later in 1080i.

TVE broadcast live the 2022 FIFA World Cup in ultra-high-definition (UHD), 4K resolution, HDR quality, and Dolby Atmos sound, free-to-air through the DTT on TVE UHD –a test channel on air since 2016–. It was the first UHD HDR broadcast of an event of that complexity and duration through the DTT ever.

On 16 November 2023, TelevisaUnivision co-produced with RTVE the 24th edition of the annual Latin Grammy Awards from the Conference and Exhibition Centre of Seville. It was the first time the awards were held outside the United States and were co-produced with a foreign network. TVE provided most of the technical resources and production staff, and broadcast it live in prime-time in Spain. Univision took charge of the direction and broadcast it in the United States tape-delayed in the corresponding prime-time of its East and West Coast feeds.

On 6 February 2024, the standard-definition (SD) versions of all its DTT channels were discontinued, and its first regular UHD DTT channel was launched, simulcasting La 1 in 4K. Due to technical problems, the actual shutdown of the SD channels and the relocation of the HD channels to make room for the regular UHD broadcast could not be done until 11 February. With this, TVE became the first-ever broadcaster to offer its main channel in UHD on free-to-air DTT covering its entire national territory.

On 16 November 2024, RTVE staged the of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest at the in Madrid, after the &#x27;s winner, , opted not to host, and having been runner-up with &quot;Loviu&quot; by Sandra Valero. With TVE in charge of the television production, it was its first time holding the contest, just twenty years after its only victory with &quot;&quot; by María Isabel in the on 20 November 2004.

<text>Nackawic is a former town in New Brunswick, Canada. It held town status prior to 2023 and is now part of the rural community of Nackawic-Millville. It is approximately 65 km west of the city of Fredericton on the east bank of the Saint John River.

Nackawic, from the Malecite Nelgwaweegek, &quot;straight stream&quot;, possibly in reference to how the mouth faces the Saint-John River.

==History==
The area was first settled in 1784 by the United Empire Loyalists, primarily through land grants to the families of soldiers who had fought with His Majesty&#x27;s Regiment of Queen&#x27;s Rangers during the American Revolutionary War.

Previously known as Otis, the development of town began in the late 1960s and was built so those forced to relocate as a result of the Mactaquac Dam being constructed would have a place to reside. Construction of the pulp mill, built to employ these displaced persons who lost their traditional farming opportunities that came with the dam, occurred between 1967 and 1970.

Nackawic was officially incorporated as a town in 1976.

On 1 January 2023, Nackawic amalgamated with the village of Millville and parts of four local service districts to form the new incorporated rural community of Nackawic-Millville. The community&#x27;s name remains in official use.

===Pulp mill===

The town&#x27;s largest employer, from 1970 until September 14, 2004, was &quot;St. Anne Nackawic Pulp Company Ltd.&quot;, founded by Karl F. Landegger. The mill closed on September 14 and its owners declared bankruptcy the following day, putting 406 people out of work. About 350 contract workers in the middle of a maintenance shutdown were also affected. The mill itself was left in a state of disassembly.

Construction of the mill began in 1967, following the building of the Mactaquac Dam. The plant manufactured high-quality, photographic grade kraft pulp. Increasing energy, material and labor costs here at home; new competition from overseas mills able to operate much less expensively as well as the continuing devaluation of the US dollar, combined with the rapid increase in value of the Canadian dollar, all contributed significantly to the St. Anne Nackawic plant becoming less viable.

At the same time, the provincial government had been undertaking a reorganization of Crown timber lands in New Brunswick in recent years which was rumored to include a reduction in the timber harvest for the St. Anne Nackawic mill. Additionally, the rise in use of digital cameras and resulting decline in the use of photographic paper had reduced the demand for St. Anne Nackawic&#x27;s product.

It was revealed during bankruptcy proceedings that St. Anne Nackawic Pulp Company Ltd. owed $101.2 million to its creditors, including $50.2 million to unsecured creditors. It was also learned that the company-funded employee pension plans were under-funded, as allowed by law. Employees under the age of 55 were informed that it was unlikely that they would receive any pension benefits. The Government of New Brunswick later stepped in and, faced with an extremely difficult decision, created a new distribution model that would see the pension fund shared by all employees, including those in the under 55 group. Understandably, those receiving pension benefits prior to the mill’s closure were outraged at the thought of being forced to give up a portion of their pension so that the under 55 group would to have at least something to look forward to during their golden years. The loss of pension benefits and the perceived unfairness of distribution sparked an outcry for the provincial government to intervene. Legal action against the Province resulted and as of July 2007, retirees and other employees still do not know what the final outcome of the pension situation will be.

George Landegger, chairman and CEO of Parsons &amp; Whittemore (later acquired by Georgia-Pacific ) of Rye Brook, New York, which was the holding company that owned St. Anne Industries which in turn owned St. Anne Nackawic Pulp Company Ltd., was responsible for ordering the shutdown. Having been unable to secure a traditional lending institution after its Bank loans were called in 2001, St. Anne Industries, in an effort to continue the operations at Nackawic, replaced the Bank and thus became the primary secured creditor of the St. Anne Nackawic mill. Many persons impacted negatively by the closure, either uninformed or unwilling to accept the cold, harsh reality of the situation, were unable to comprehend how the primary secured creditor could rightfully receive the funds to which it was entitled – enjoying the same right as the Bank in similar proceedings. Parsons and Whittemore later agreed to relinquish title to the plant and equipment, and at the same time shedding its officers and directors of their personal liability environmental – a rather serious matter that transcends all Bankruptcy law, allowing the provincial government to seek a buyer for the facility.

In addition to most of the local businesses in the Nackawic area, some of the creditors and companies affected by the closure of the mill included the Port of Saint John, Logistec Corporation, Wallenius Wilhelmsen, and Star Shipping. It is certainly notable that the aforementioned Logistec Corporation received, from the Landegger-appointed Receiver, full and complete payment for everything it was owed up to the moment of Bankruptcy. This payment was made after the Bankruptcy was declared and was successfully challenged in the Courts by the replacement Trustee. In a surprise decision that left the legal community entirely baffled, the New Brunswick Court of Appeals later ruled that this was not a preferential payment, which would have been in serious contravention of the BIA (Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act).

A group of 19 contractors working on site when the mill was closed joined together and was successful in a number of significant wins in the Bankruptcy proceedings. First, this group of 19 secured their position by placing liens on the mill property. Next, the group of 19 had the original Trustee, who also served as the Landegger-appointed Receiver, replaced with one who would better serve the best interests of all the unsecured creditors. At the first Meeting of Creditors, the original Trustee told those in attendance that there was &quot;absolutely no money in the Estate for the unsecured creditors&quot;. However, the newly installed Trustee was successful in finding more than five million dollars. These funds were secured for the benefit of all unsecured creditors and distributed accordingly.

Then, the group of 19 was successful in its bid to have frozen all funds held by the Receiver for the benefit of the primary secured creditor, effectively preventing the primary secured creditor from realizing on its security and, the resulting removal of these monies from the Province. Eventually faced with the inability to continue funding the many challenges entirely on their own, without assistance from the other major stakeholders, the group had no choice but to release their hold on these funds.

It was very unfortunate that those representing union and staff, as well as the appointed pension fund administrator did not see fit to join the group of 19 in helping fund the efforts of the new Trustee, for if they had the 5 million dollar pot would have likely grown substantially, benefiting all the unsecured creditors — the largest portion of which consisted of the displaced employees.

In the fall of 2004, some of the laid-off workers initially offered to work without pay in order to properly mothball the plant and protect the assets against the fast-approaching harsh winter season, ensuring the plant would be more attractive to any future potential buyers. With an injection of cash from both the Federal and provincial governments of the day, the work was carried out and the mill properly secured. (All workers received full pay for their efforts.) Other workers proposed buying the mill with government assistance and running it themselves. As the provincial government was also a creditor for the plant, it solicited potential pulp and paper industry companies such as J.D. Irving Limited and Tembec to purchase the mothballed mill.

After several discouraging months of little interest during the fall of 2004 and winter of 2005, the provincial government entered into negotiations with Quebec-based Tembec in early winter of 2005. A deal was announced, however Tembec subsequently backed out, on March 8, 2005, claiming that it wasn&#x27;t economically feasible.

However, several weeks later, on April 1, 2005, the provincial government, led by Bernard Lord’s Tories, announced that Tembec would be forming a partnership with the Aditya Birla Group of India, which would see the Nackawic mill reopened as a joint venture, with Tembec the lead operator of the facility. The plant reopened on January 16, 2006, under the &quot;AV Nackawic&quot; banner.

The Tembec-Aditya Birla Group agreement is very similar to the operation of a pulp mill in Atholville, New Brunswick which had been mothballed between 1988–1994 in circumstances very similar to Nackawic&#x27;s, causing significant damage to the economy of nearby Campbellton, New Brunswick. After Tembec-Aditya Birla Group purchased the former Fraser mill, the facility was converted to a dissolving pulp production operation and has operated successfully ever since as A.V. Cell Inc.

In August 2008, the AV Nackawic mill is operating splendidly and the new owners are currently making a 90 million+ capital investment at the Nackawic facility. Once completed, the newly created ability to produce dissolving pulp -in addition to kraft pulp- will go a long way in helping to ensure the long-term viability of this vital area business.

==2014 Municipal building fire==
On July 21, 2014, a man drove his pickup truck into the municipal building, which housed the town hall and the fire hall. The man was arrested by the RCMP. One fire official estimated cost of damage to the departments trucks to be $1.5 million.

<doc id="444428" wikidata="Q528183" url="?curid=444428" title="Battle of Newtown">
<text>The Battle of Newtown (August 29, 1779) was the only major battle of the Sullivan Expedition, an armed offensive led by Major General John Sullivan that was ordered by George Washington to end the threat of the Iroquois who had sided with the British in the American Revolutionary War. Opposing Sullivan&#x27;s four brigades were 250 Loyalist soldiers from Butler&#x27;s Rangers, commanded by Major John Butler, and 350 Iroquois and Delaware (Lenape). Butler and Mohawk war leader Joseph Brant did not want to make a stand at Newtown, and instead proposed to harass the enemy on the march, but were overruled by Sayenqueraghta and other Indigenous war leaders.

This battle, which was the most significant military engagement of the campaign, took place at the foot of a hill along the Chemung River just outside what is now Elmira, New York.

==Terrain==
The engagement occurred along a tall hill, now called Sullivan Hill and part of the Newtown Battlefield State Park. The hillside, running southeast to northwest next to the Chemung River, was a mile long at its crest, which rose above the path at its base leading into the Delaware village of Newtown. The slope of the hill was covered with pine and a dense growth of shrub oak. Hoffman Hollow, a marshy area of small hillocks and thick stands of trees, was just to the east of the hill. A small watercourse, called Baldwin Creek, ran through the hollow and emptied into the Chemung River (referred to as the Cayuga branch in Sullivan&#x27;s reports). The creek followed the hill northwest on the opposite side from the river and had steep western banks.

==Iroquois and British Preparation==

In May 1779, in response to rumours of a planned American invasion of Iroquois territory, Butler, accompanied by five companies of Butler&#x27;s Rangers and a detachment of the 8th Regiment of Foot, left Fort Niagara and established a forward operating base at Kanadaseaga located near the northern end of Seneca Lake. In the middle of August, Butler accompanied by about 300 Seneca and Cayuga warriors led by Sayenqueraghta, Cornplanter, and Fish Carrier moved south to the Chemung River where they were joined by Joseph Brant and Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, as well as a number of Delaware. 

Butler and Brant suggested that, because of the size and composition of Sullivan&#x27;s forces, harassment raids would be more effective than making a stand. They were overruled by Sayenqueraghta, Cornplanter and the Delaware who selected a position on the north side of the Chemung River for an ambush.

The Rangers and their native allies hastily constructed a horseshoe-shaped camouflaged breastwork of logs about up the southeast spur of the hill, within musket range of the path. The hill was used as both an observation point and a barrier to the approach of the Continental Army.

==Expedition and battle==
On August 26, 1779, Sullivan left Fort Sullivan, where the two columns of his army had converged, with an estimated 3,200 well-armed troops. They marched slowly up the Chemung River with the intention of destroying the towns and crops of the Six Nations in central New York. On the morning of Sunday, August 29, about ten miles upriver from Fort Sullivan, the advance guard, three companies of riflemen formerly with the Provisional Rifle Corps of Colonel Daniel Morgan, drew close to Butler&#x27;s position. Suspecting an ambush, they halted and scouted the area. They discovered the hidden breastwork and immediately notified Brigadier General Edward Hand. Hand dispatched his light infantry to take up firing positions behind the bank of Baldwin Creek. The defenders made several unsuccessful attempts at luring the Continentals into an ambush. As the extended army continued to arrive and assemble, Sullivan called a council of war with his brigade commanders. Together they devised a plan of attack.

The 1st New Jersey Regiment, commanded by Colonel Matthias Ogden, was detached from Brigadier General William Maxwell&#x27;s New Jersey Brigade and sent west along the Chemung River to a position on Major Butler&#x27;s right flank. Similarly, the New York Brigade of Brigadier General James Clinton and the New Hampshire Brigade of Brigadier General Enoch Poor were dispatched together eastward, along a circuitous route through Hoffman Hollow, with the mission of approaching the hill&#x27;s northeastern flank. At the end of the first hour, the artillery of six three-pounders, two howitzers, and a coehorn posted on a rise near the path, would open fire on the breastwork. The guns would signal Hand to feint an attack upon the center of the horseshoe, at which time the brigades to the northeast would climb the hill and pivot left to attack the rear of the breastwork. When the guns of Poor&#x27;s and Clinton&#x27;s attack were heard by Hand, his brigade would storm the works, supported by Maxwell&#x27;s brigade, putting the defenders in a crossfire.

The plan was complex and conceived on short notice but the ultimate result was a defeat for Butler&#x27;s Rangers and their Indigenous allies. Crossing the swampy marsh (which Sullivan termed a &quot;morass&quot;) in Hoffman Hollow slowed the advance of Poor&#x27;s and Clinton&#x27;s brigades, disrupting the timing of the plan, and this provided just enough delay to allow Butler and the Iroquois to escape along the crest of the hill. The artillery barrage opened well before Poor and Clinton were in position which forced the Rangers and Iroquois back from the breastwork before they could be encircled. While some of the defenders turned and ran, the main body of Butler&#x27;s forces skirmished with the Americans as they withdrew.

Nearly all of the Continentals&#x27; casualties occurred during a counterattack on Lieutenant Colonel George Reid&#x27;s 2nd New Hampshire Regiment. Assigned to the extreme left of Poor&#x27;s assault formation, the regiment climbed where the slope was steepest and lagged considerably behind the rest of the brigade. Joseph Brant led the assault and nearly encircled Reid. The next regiment in line, the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Dearborn, about-faced, fired two volleys and advanced back down the hill to assist Reid, as did two of Clinton&#x27;s regiments. The counterattack was turned back, however, it allowed the bulk of Butler&#x27;s forces to escape.

After razing two Delaware villages and destroying all crops in the vicinity, Sullivan&#x27;s army turned north and over the next three weeks destroyed at least 40 hastily abandoned Seneca and Cayuga villages before returning to Fort Sullivan.

==Sullivan&#x27;s Casualties==

Sources differ as to the number of American casualties. Captain James Norris of the 3rd New Hampshire recorded three dead and 36 wounded during the battle. In his report to George Washington, General Sullivan also reported three dead but increased the number of wounded to 39. Five of the wounded died from their wounds within three weeks of the battle bringing the total to eight dead.

Dead:
*Lieutenant Nathaniel McCauley (died August 30 following amputation of his leg)
*Private Abner Dearborn (nephew of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Dearborn died September 2)
*Sergeant Demeret and Corporal Hunter 
*Josiah Mitchell, Sylvester Williams and two other privates.

Wounded:
*Major Benjamin Titcomb
*Capt. Elijah Clayes (died November 30, 1779)

*Sgt. Oliver Thurston
*28 additional wounded

==Iroquois and British Casualties==

Major Butler reported five of his Rangers killed or taken and three wounded as well as five killed and nine wounded among the Iroquois. American sources reported two prisoners taken, and twelve dead natives including a woman.

==Legacy==

In 1973 the Newtown Battlefield National Historic Landmark was established by the federal government, recognizing its significant history. The Landmark encompasses nearly in the towns of Ashland, Chemung and Elmira.

Today, the site of the battle is partially obscured by the Wellsburg exit of Interstate 86 and New York State Route 17. Several roadside signs in the vicinity of the interchange mark various troop locations.

To commemorate the battle&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 1879, a small parcel of land atop what is now known as Sullivan Hill was donated to create Newtown Battlefield Park. A fieldstone tower was built. This tower collapsed during a thunderstorm on August 30, 1911. That same year, of land including the park was deeded to the State of New York and named the Newtown Battlefield Reservation. A new granite obelisk monument was erected and dedicated in 1912. Further expansion eventually resulted in the creation of the Newtown Battlefield State Park. 

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved an additional of the battlefield adjacent to the Newtown Battlefield State Park.

In an effort to incorporate the Newtown Battlefield site into the National Park System, Congressional resolution H.R. 6866, which directed Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Newtown Battlefield and the suitability and feasibility of its inclusion in the National Parks System, was put forth for consideration by Congressman Randy Kuhl. The bill stalled in January 2009 after being referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands.

<text>Toplița (; , ) is a city in Harghita County, Transylvania, Romania.

The settlement has had multiple name changes: &quot;Taplócza&quot;, &quot;Toplicza&quot;, &quot;Gyergyó-Toplicza&quot;, from February 3, 1861 &quot;Oláh-Toplicza&quot;, or &quot;Romanian Toplița&quot;, then from January 1, 1907 &quot;Maroshévíz&quot;, until 1918, when it received the Romanian name &quot;Toplița Română&quot;. Both the Romanian and the Hungarian name mean &quot;hot water spring&quot;; the former is a Romanian word of Slavic origin.

The city administers eight villages: Călimănel (&quot;Kelemenpatak&quot;), Luncani (&quot;Lunkány&quot;), Măgheruș (&quot;Magyaros&quot;), Moglănești (&quot;Moglán&quot;), Secu (&quot;Székpatak&quot;), Vâgani (&quot;Vugány&quot;), Vale (&quot;Válya&quot;), and Zencani (&quot;Zsákhegy&quot;).

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Toplița had a population of 12,609. At the census from 2011, there were 13,282 people living in the city; of this population, 68.49% were ethnic Romanians, while 22.11% were ethnic Hungarians (primarily Székelys) and 3.64% ethnic Romani.

Among the villages which are part of this municipality, there are large ethnic Hungarian minorities in Măgheruș (34%), Moglănești (21.5%), Secu (29.7%), and Zencani (23.7%).

==Geography==
Toplița is located in eastern Transylvania, on the upper reaches of the Mureș River, more precisely in the northwestern corner of Harghita County. It is situated at an altitude of above sea level, on the Giurgiului plain between the mountains of Giurgiului, Gurghiului and Călimani. The nearest towns are Borsec (), Gheorgheni () and Reghin ().

==History==
The region was Simon Bán&#x27;s property until 1228, then passed on to the Bánffy family, who managed to keep their enormous properties until 1945. As a feudal domain, the area was not part of any of the Székely seats (&quot;sedes judiciaria&quot;, Székely district with special national privileges).

The settlement was founded in 1567 by Kozma Petričević on land owned by Pál Bánffy. He gave the land to three Moldavian peasant families and named the place &quot;Taplócza&quot;.

In 1658, Gyergyó-Toplicza was entirely destroyed by Moldavian units led by Pintea. After 1660, the Bánffys brought 391 Romanian peasant families from Deda onto these lands. Around 1710, rafting started on the Mureș River. Due to this profitable enterprise, Toplicza and its inhabitants started growing and evolving in both wealth and numbers. The first European census, ordered by Emperor Joseph II, took place in Toplicza on 20 November 1785. Census results showed 227 farms, 23 free and 231 thrall families who belonged to 22 lords. Baron János Bornemissza owned 52 of these families, while Baron Simon Kemény owned 30 and Count Mihály Teleki 18.

In 1868, eight &quot;praedia&quot; belonged to Oláh-Toplicza: Kelemenpatak, Nyírmező, Csobotány, Mănăstirea, Vugány, Moglán, Plopiș, and Magyarós; at the time Válya was already part of the settlement. Nowadays, it comprises Valea, Zencani, Vâgani, Secu, Moglănești, Măgheruș, and Luncani.

During World War I, Toplița and its periphery witnessed cruel fighting. The Romanian monument in Secu is the tomb of 771 Romanian soldiers, while in the Hungarian Soldiers Cemetery 450 Hungarian soldiers were buried. Until 1918 it was part of Maros-Torda County in the Kingdom of Hungary in Austria-Hungary. At the end of November 1918, the 7th Infantry Division of the Romanian Army under the command of General Traian Moșoiu crossed the Carpathian Mountains, coming from Piatra Neamț and advancing though the Prisăcani Valley towards Borsec, Toplița, and Reghin. After the Union of Transylvania with Romania in December 1918 and the start of the Hungarian–Romanian War, Toplița passed under Romanian administration; after the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania. 

In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary. Towards the end of World War II, Romanian and Soviet armies entered the town in October 1944. The territory of Northern Transylvania remained under Soviet military administration until March 9, 1945 (after the appointment of Petru Groza as Prime Minister), after which it became again part of Romania. 

In 1952 Toplița was declared a town, and became part of the Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, it became part of Harghita County. In 2002 it was declared a municipality.

<text>Vera Christiane Felscherinow (born 20 May 1962) is a German actress and musician who is best known for her contribution to the 1978 autobiographical book &quot;Christiane F.&quot; (original title:Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo ), and the film and television miniseries based on the book, in which her teenage drug use is documented.

==Early life==
Felscherinow was born in Hamburg, but her family moved to West Berlin when she was a child. They settled in Gropiusstadt, a neighbourhood in Neukölln that consisted mainly of high-rise apartment blocks where social problems were prevalent. Felscherinow&#x27;s father frequently drank large volumes of alcohol and was abusive towards his two daughters while her mother was absorbed by an extra-marital relationship.

When she was 12 years old, she began smoking hashish with a group of friends who were slightly older at a local youth club. They gradually began using stronger drugs such as LSD and various forms of pills and she ended up using heroin. By the time she was 14, she was heroin-dependent and a prostitute, mainly at West Berlin&#x27;s then-largest railway station Bahnhof Zoo. During this period, she became part of a group of teenage drug-users and sex workers of both sexes.

==&quot;Christiane F.&quot;==

===The book===
Two journalists from the news magazine &quot;Stern&quot;, Kai Hermann and Horst Rieck, met Felscherinow in 1978 in Berlin when she was a witness in a trial of a man who paid underaged girls with heroin in return for sex. The journalists wanted to disclose the drug problem among teenagers in Berlin, which was severe but also surrounded by strong taboos, and arranged a two-hour interview with Felscherinow. The two hours extended to two months, as Felscherinow provided an in-depth description of her life, as well as those of other teenagers, in West Berlin during the 1970s. The journalists subsequently ran a series of articles about her heroin use in &quot;Stern&quot;, based on the tape-recorded interviews with Felscherinow.

In 1979, the &quot;Stern&quot; publishing house published a book based on the interviews, &quot;Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo&quot;. The book chronicles Felscherinow&#x27;s life from 1975 to 1978, between the ages of 12 and 15 years, and depicts several of Felscherinow&#x27;s friends, along with other drug users, as well as scenes from typical locations of the Berlin drug scene at the time. The narrative of the book is in the first person, from Felscherinow&#x27;s viewpoint, but was written by the journalists functioning as ghostwriters. Others, such as Felscherinow&#x27;s mother and various people who witnessed the escalating drug situation in Berlin at the time, also contributed to the book.

The UK issue of the book was released by Corgi on 21 August 1981 under the title &quot;H. Autobiography of a Child Prostitute and Heroin Addict&quot; and was translated by Susanne Flatauer ( ).

The first American edition of the book was released by Bantam in 1982 under the title &quot;Christiane F.: Autobiography of a Girl of the Streets and Heroin Addict&quot;, also translated by Susanne Flatauer (). As of October 2013, Felscherinow continues to receive monthly royalty payments close to €2,000 (US$2,720) for the book &quot;Christiane F.&quot; and the film. In 2013, a new translation by Christina Cartwright was published by Zest Books of San Francisco under the title &quot;Zoo Station&quot;.

===The film===
In 1981, the book was adapted into a film that was directed by Uli Edel and produced by Bernd Eichinger and Hans Weth. The screenplay was written by Herman Weigel and Natja Brunckhorst played the role of the titular character. Its title in Germany was &quot;Christiane F. – Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo&quot;, and in English-speaking countries &quot;Christiane F.&quot;

Much of the movie is shot in the actual surroundings of Gropiusstadt and Bahnhof Zoo. David Bowie, Christiane&#x27;s favorite singer at the time of the interviews that informed the book, appears as himself in a concert. Bowie also provided the movie&#x27;s soundtrack that was released in Germany in 1981.

In a December 2013 interview, Felscherinow stated that she attended the German premiere of the film with Bowie, who picked her up in a chauffeured limousine: &quot;I thought David Bowie was going to be the star of my movie, but it was all about me.&quot; Felscherinow agreed that the film was an accurate portrayal of her life at the time, but revealed that she does not like the film &quot;that much&quot;:

== Post-&quot;Christiane F.&quot; ==
After the initial success of the book and the film, Felscherinow found herself becoming something of a celebrity, both in Germany and other countries in Europe. A subculture of teenage girls in Germany began to emulate her style of dress and spent time around the Bahnhof Zoo, which became an unlikely tourist attraction. This development concerned drug experts in the youth field, who feared that, despite the film&#x27;s bleakness and numerous drug-related scenes (particularly those portraying the reality of heroin withdrawal), vulnerable teens might regard Felscherinow as a cult hero and role model.

Between 1982 and 1985, Felscherinow lived in Zürich with the Keel family, owners of the Diogenes publishing house. During this time she met Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Patricia Highsmith and Patrick Süskind. In 2013 she explained that she &quot;lived between literature stars and the heroin scene&quot; and described Platzspitz park in Zürich as &quot;like Disney World for junkies&quot;; however, Felscherinow further explained that the area became &quot;a heap of garbage&quot; as people died after contracting the hepatitis C and HIV viruses, and rival gangs engaged in violent conflict.

In the early 1980s, Felscherinow&#x27;s boyfriend was Alexander Hacke, from the German industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten, and together they released two albums under the moniker Sentimentale Jugend, including a cover version of the Rolling Stones song &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, on the Das Cassetten Combinat label. They also appeared together in the 1983 German film &quot;Decoder&quot;, which also featured William S. Burroughs and Genesis P-Orridge. Felscherinow explained in 2013 that Hacke was a &quot;friend of a friend&quot; who used her residence to hide from the media who were aware of his problematic heroin use at the time. She also stated that she is glad that Hacke&#x27;s life has become stable: &quot;I&#x27;m happy he got rid of his problems and has a family now.&quot;

On 10 October 2013, Felscherinow released a new autobiographical book titled &quot;Mein Zweites Leben&quot; (&quot;My Second Life&quot;) in which she elaborates on her life following the release of the &quot;Christiane F.&quot; book. In a promotional interview, prior to the autobiography&#x27;s release date, Felscherinow revealed her motivation for writing the second book: &quot;No, there&#x27;s no message [in the book]. It was just that I wanted to make a counterstatement. There was all that junk, all the headlines! I finally wanted to describe what it was really like.&quot; However, she counters this statement in a December 2013 interview:

Felscherinow contracted hepatitis C from an infected needle in the late 1980s. She suffers from cirrhosis of the liver and rejects interferon treatment because of the side effects. In 2013, Felscherinow stated: &quot;I will die soon, I know that. But I haven&#x27;t missed out on anything in my life. I am fine with it. So this isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d recommend: this isn&#x27;t the best life to live, but it&#x27;s my life.&quot;

===Drug use===
When Felscherinow was 19 years old, she went to the United States to promote the film about her; she was arrested for heroin and opium possession and had to leave the country.

She lived with her son (born 1996) in Teltow, Germany, but, in 2008 after they both relocated to Amsterdam, Felscherinow temporarily lost custody of her son in August 2008, after authorities intervened in Berlin. In late January 2011, Felscherinow was searched during a drug raid in Moritzplatz, a Berlin subway station then known for its drug market; however, the search did not reveal any drugs.

In an October 2013 interview, Felscherinow expressed her frustration with public perceptions of her since the publication of &quot;Christiane F.&quot;:

Felscherinow stated in a December 2013 interview that while she continues to consume methadone and occasionally smokes a cannabis joint, alcohol is her main drug issue at the age of 51 years. In response to a question of why she never discontinued illicit drug use, she explained: &quot;I never wanted to give them up. I didn&#x27;t know anything else. I decided to live a different life to other people. I don&#x27;t need a pretence to stop.&quot;

<text>Covasna (, , , ) is a town in Covasna County, Transylvania, Romania, at an altitude of . It is known for its natural mineral waters and mofettas.

The town administers one village, Chiuruș (). The village has a population of 451 and has an absolute Székely Hungarian majority.

Before Orbaiszék merged with Sepsiszék and Kézdiszék to create Háromszék County, in 1876, Covasna was the capital village of Orbaiszék.

==Name origin==
There are several theories regarding the origin of the city&#x27;s name, the most recognized one being that it originates from the Slavic &quot;kvas&quot;, which means &quot;bitter&quot;, referring to the taste of the mineral water springs located in the city.

According to Szabó Gyula (1914–1984), some legends suggest that the name of &quot;Kovászna&quot; might have been the result of a fusion between the name of &quot;&quot;Kó&quot; and the word &quot;vászon&quot; (it means &quot;canvas&quot; in Hungarian), thus meaning &quot;Kó&#x27;s canvas&quot;. Theories suggest that the individual of &quot;Kó&quot;&quot; might have been a knight, a craftsman or even the last monarch of the Fairies Fortress.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Covasna had a population of 9,208; of those, 60.34% were Hungarians and 31.14% were Romanians. At the 2011 census, the town had 10,265 inhabitants, of which 7,549 or 66.4% were Hungarians and 3,672 or 32.3% were Romanians.

&quot;Demographic movement according to the censuses:&quot;

<doc id="444443" wikidata="Q148479" url="?curid=444443" title="Hamamelidaceae">
<text>Hamamelidaceae, commonly referred to as the witch-hazel family, is a family of flowering plants in the order Saxifragales. The clade consists of shrubs and small trees positioned within the woody clade of the core Saxifragales. An earlier system, the Cronquist system, recognized Hamamelidaceae in the Hamamelidales order.

== Description ==

The Hamamelidaceae are distinguishable from other families in the Saxifragales due to the range of floral characteristics that are generally uniform though all genera. Uniform characteristics include stipules borne on stems with leaves often 2-ranked. Genera usually have a two carpel gynoecium, although some species show variation. Other characteristics include a multicellular stigma, with shallow papillae or ridges.

===Anthers===
Anther structure and the modes of opening are considered to be one of the most important features in the systematics and evolution of hamamelids. The anthers in Hamamelids are on average shorter than in other families in the Saxifragales. The anther valve openings are unique pleismorphic features that contrast with the simple longitudinal slits of the anthers in the upper Hamamelidae where the pollen is predominantly wind-driven.

The three types of anthers found in the Hamamelidaceae are:

* Type 1) The theca (or sheath of anther) opens like a window with two wings; a common anther type.
* Type 2) There is one valve opening to reveal two pollen sacs. Five genera in the Hamamelidoideae subfamily, confined to the Southern Hemisphere (&quot;Trichcladus&quot;, &quot;Dicoryphe&quot;, &quot;Ostrearia&quot;, &quot;Neostrearia&quot;, &quot;Noahdendron&quot;) are known to have this anther type.
* Type 3) One valve opens a wing of anther tissue towards the center of the flower revealing one pollen sac. The two genera, &quot;Exbucklandia&quot; and &quot;Hamamelis&quot; are known to have this anther type.

===Pollen===

Plants of the Hamamelidaceae have sticky pollen, which may have influenced the type of pollination that is seen in this family. Pollination is predominantly via insects or wind. However, the insect-pollinated genus &quot;Disanthus&quot; has been known to wind-pollinate (although inefficiently) in the event pollinators do not visit its flowers. The genus &quot;Rhodoleia&quot; is unique because it is bird-pollinated.
The pollen structure in the lower Hamamelidae is relatively uniform. The pollen patterns are tricolpate with reticulate exines.

===Flowers===

The petals of the Hamamelidaceae are generally narrow and ribbon-like. The exceptions are the genera &quot;Corylopsis&quot; and &quot;Rhodoleia&quot;, which have spathulate or circular-like petals.

The flowers of Hamamelidaceae are mostly bisexual with perianth parts, which mature to fruits arranged in spikes, racemes or nonglobose heads.

===Breeding systems===

The anemophilous groups within the Hamamelidaceae are often andromonoecious. Self-incompatibility is common, but self-compatibility occurs in some genera such as &quot;Hamamelis&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

The fossil record dates from the Eocene. Hamamelidaceae was established by Brown in 1818 as the Hamamelideae, including four genera. The phylogenetic relationship of the Hamamelidaceae have been revisited several times since the first comprehensive classification of the family in 1930. This was clarified in 1998 by the molecular phylogenetic work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) which placed the family within the eudicot order Saxifragales. In doing so, it separated one of the existing subfamilies, the Altingioideae, which formed the basal group, into its own family within the order, the Altingiaceae.

=== Subdivision ===

==== Subfamilies ====

The infrafamilial classification of the Hamamelidaceae has been controversial, and has undergone a number of revisions based on morphology, the best known of which are those of Harms (1930) and Endress (1989).

Morphological and DNA studies have supported monophyly of the Hamamelidoideae and have recognized the separation of the Rhodoleioideae and Disanthoideae subfamily and newly erected Mytilarioideae.

The relationships between Exbucklandioideae and the other subfamilies have proven controversial. The unresolved monophyly of Exbucklandioideae and the clades of Disanthoideae, Rhodoleioideae, Exbucklandioideae or even Mytilarioideae being a sister clade to Hamamelidoideae may have been a result of differing DNA methodologies researchers have used to produce phylogenetic trees and the inclusion or exclusion of certain genera used as outgroups in their analyses. However, the sister relationship of Disanthoideae and Hamamelidoideae has been well supported, although some researchers do not support this. Strong support for making Altingioideae a family has been recognized by textbooks and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. Research continues to resolve the deep relationships of the subfamilies within the Hamamelidaceae by incorporating whole or fragmentary fossil evidence.

Hamamelidaceae contains 27-30 genera and 80-140 species distributed among five to six subfamilies. The subfamilies are Exbucklandioideae, Rhodoleioideae, Mytilarioideae, Disanthoideae, Hamamelidoideae, and Altingioideae, which has been elevated to a family Altingiaceae in some recent treatments. Many of the subfamilies are monotypic and the majority of the species lie within the Hamamelidoideae, which has 22 genera.

The long-standing question of whether Altingioideae should be a separate family has been assessed and supported by morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies.
The resulting subfamilial structure was eventually resolved in a series of molecular studies in the late 1990s, resulting in five distinct subfamilies, the majority of the genera residing in the nominative subfamily, Hamamelidoideae:
;Subfamilies (number of genera)
* Exbucklandioideae (1 genus; &quot;Exbucklandia&quot;)
* Rhodoleioideae (1 genus; &quot;Rhodoleia&quot;)
* Mytilarioideae (2 genera; &quot;Mytilaria&quot;, &quot;Chunia&quot;)
* Disanthoideae (1 genus; &quot;Disanthus&quot;)
* Hamamelidoideae (22 genera; see Tribes below)

==== Tribes ====

The relatively large size of subfamily Hamamelidoideae and its further subdivision into tribes has also been a matter of study and controversy. Six tribes are now recognized. The revised structure has greatly reduced Hamamelideae to a monotypic taxon, which had previously been further divided into subtribes:
* Corylopsideae (1 genus; &quot;Corylopsis&quot;)
* Dicorypheae (5 genera; &quot;Dicoryphe&quot;, &quot;Trichocladus&quot;, &quot;Neostrearia&quot;, &quot;Noahdendron&quot;, &quot;Ostrearia&quot;)
* Eustigmateae (4 genera; &quot;Eustigma&quot;, &quot;Fortunearia&quot;, &quot;Sinowilsonia&quot;, &quot;Molinadendron&quot;)
* Fothergilleae (7 genera; &quot;Fothergilla&quot;, &quot;Parrotiopsis&quot;, &quot;Parrotia&quot;, &quot;Shaniodendron&quot;, &quot;Sycopsis&quot;, &quot;Distylium&quot;, &quot;Distyliopsis&quot;)
* Hamamelideae (1 genus; &quot;Hamamelis&quot;)
* Loropetaleae (4 genera; &quot;Loropetalum&quot; (including &quot;Tetrathyrium&quot;), &quot;Maingaya&quot;, &quot;Embolanthera&quot;, &quot;Matudaea&quot;)

== Distribution and habitat ==

The Hamamelidaceae were widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere during the Upper Cretaceous and early Tertiary.
 Quaternary glaciation across the Northern Hemisphere caused the extinction of numerous species and the restricted distribution of others. Hamamelidaceae were obliterated from Europe along with numerous other genera of plants that were unable to escape the ice sheets due to geography (the Mediterranean Sea and Alps forming barriers that did not exist in North America and Asia).

The largest subfamily, the Hamamelidoideae, is now distributed in North America and western and eastern Asia. The Hamamelidoideae subtribe Dicoryphinae is now restricted to the African (including Madagascar and Comores) and Australian continents.

Disanthoideae and Rhodoleioideae are now restricted to southern China and the Caucasus region. Mytilarioideae is restricted to eastern Asia. Altingioideae is now restricted to eastern Asia and western Asia and North America between central Mexico and Belize.

<text>Karabük Province () is a landlocked province in the northern part of Anatolia (northern central Turkey), located about north of Ankara, away from Zonguldak and away from Kastamonu. Its area is 4,142 km2, and its population is 252,058 (2022). The main city is Karabük which is located about south of the Black Sea coast.

== Overview ==
Karabük Province is one of the newest provinces of Turkey. Established in 1995, it comprises Karabük, Eflani, Safranbolu and Yenice districts which were formerly part of Zonguldak Province and Eskipazar and Ovacık districts which were previously part of Çankırı Province.

Karabük is located on the highway between Bartın and Ankara, which was in ancient times an important route between Amasra on the coast and central Anatolia. The railway between Ankara and Zonguldak passes through Karabük.

Safranbolu, a historically important city, which is listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List, is located in Karabük Province.

== Districts ==

Karabük province is divided into 6 districts (capital district in bold):
* Eflani
* Eskipazar
* Karabük
* Ovacık
* Safranbolu
* Yenice
== History ==

Karabük received its name from its geography. Its name occurred from combine of &quot;Kara&quot;, meaning black in English, and &quot;Bük&quot;, meaning shrubbery in English.

Although there are many tumuli and hill towns which give information of history of the region before the invention of writing, due to absence of scientific analysis, there is not sufficient information. However, as to archeological researches which were done around Eskipazar and Ovacık, the earliest site in this region is Yazıboy, which is a village of Eskipazar nowadays. Researchers think that one of tumulus in this village reach today from b.c. 2500.

<text>Liquidambar, commonly called sweetgum (star gum in the UK), gum, redgum, satin-walnut, styrax or American storax, is the only genus in the flowering plant family Altingiaceae and has 15 species. They were formerly often treated as a part of the Hamamelidaceae. They are native to southeast and east Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and North America. They are decorative deciduous trees that are used in the wood industry and for ornamental purposes.

==Etymology==
Both the scientific and common names refer to the sweet resinous sap (&quot;liquid amber&quot;) exuded by the trunk when cut.

==Species==
===Extant species===
===Fossils===
* †&quot;Liquidambar changii&quot; - Miocene (Washington state, North America)

==Description==

They are all large, deciduous trees, tall, with palmately 3- to 7-lobed leaves arranged spirally on the stems and length of , having a pleasant aroma when crushed. Their leaves can be many colors such as bright red, orange, yellow, and even purple. Mature bark is grayish and vertically grooved. The flowers are small, produced in a dense globular inflorescence diameter, pendulous on a stem. The fruit is a woody multiple capsule in diameter (popularly called a &quot;gumball&quot;), containing numerous seeds and covered in numerous prickly, woody armatures, possibly to attach to fur of animals. The woody biomass is classified as hardwood.
At higher latitudes, Liquidambars are among the last of trees to leaf out in the spring, and also among the last of trees to drop its leaves in the fall/autumn, turning multiple colors. Fall/autumn colors are most brilliant where nights are chilly, but some cultivars color well in warm climates.

==Distribution==
Species within this genus are native to Southeast and east Asia, the western Mediterranean, and eastern North America. Countries and regions in which they occur are: Indonesia (Nusa Tenggara, Java, Sumatra); Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia); Thailand; Cambodia; Vietnam; China (including Tibet, Fujian, Guizhou, Hainan, Yunnan, Zhejiang), Taiwan, South Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Bhutan, Turkey, Greece (Rhodes), Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize, Mexico, and the eastern United States (from Texas to Connecticut). It is regarded as an artificially introduced species in India, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. In cultivation, they can be seen in warm temperate and subtropical climates around the world.

==Fossil records==
This genus is known in the fossil record from the Cretaceous to the Quaternary (age range: 99.7 to 0.781 million years ago). The genus was much more widespread in the Tertiary, but has disappeared from Europe due to extensive glaciation in the north and the east–west oriented Alps and Pyrenees, which have served as a blockade against southward migration. It has also disappeared from western North America due to climate change, and also from the unglaciated (but nowadays too cold) Russian Far East. There are several fossil species of &quot;Liquidambar&quot;, showing its relict status today.

==Uses==
The wood is used for furniture, interior finish, paper pulp, veneers and baskets of all kinds. The heartwood once was used in furniture, sometimes as imitation mahogany or Circassian walnut. It is used widely today in flake and strand boards. Sweetgum is a foodplant for various caterpillars. The American sweetgum is widely planted as an ornamental, within its natural range and elsewhere.

The hardened sap, or gum resin, excreted from the wounds of the sweetgum, for example, the American sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), can be chewed on like chewing gum and has been long used for this purpose in the Southern United States. The sap was also believed to be a cure for sciatica, weakness of nerves, etc.

In Traditional Chinese medicine, &quot;lu lu tong&quot;, or &quot;all roads open,&quot; is the hard, spiky fruit of native sweetgum species. It first appeared in Chinese medical literature in &quot;Omissions from the Materia Medica,&quot; by Chen Cangqi, in 720 AD. Bitter in taste, aromatic, and neutral in temperature, &quot;lu lu tong&quot; is claimed to promote the movement of blood and qi, water metabolism and urination, expels wind, and unblocks the channels. It is supposedly an ingredient in formulas for epigastric distention or abdominal pain, anemia, irregular or scanty menstruation, low back or knee pain and stiffness, edema with difficult urination, or nasal congestion.

In the fall/autumn, the trees drop their hard, spiky seedpods by the hundreds, which can become a serious nuisance on pavements and lawns. Some US cities have expedited permits to remove sweetgum trees.

In Louisiana folklore, a sharpened stick from this tree can be used to wound a cryptid known as the &quot;Parlangua&quot; (a hybrid of man and alligator).

<text>In mathematics, the Weierstrass M-test is a test for determining whether an infinite series of functions converges uniformly and absolutely. It applies to series whose terms are bounded functions with real or complex values, and is analogous to the comparison test for determining the convergence of series of real or complex numbers. It is named after the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897).

== Statement ==
Weierstrass M-test. 
Suppose that (&quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a sequence of real- or complex-valued functions defined on a set &quot;A&quot;, and that there is a sequence of non-negative numbers (&quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot;) satisfying the conditions
* formula_1 for all formula_2 and all formula_3, and
* formula_4 converges.
Then the series 
:formula_5
converges absolutely and uniformly on &quot;A&quot;.

A series satisfying the hypothesis is called &quot;normally convergent&quot;. The result is often used in combination with the uniform limit theorem. Together they say that if, in addition to the above conditions, the set &quot;A&quot; is a topological space and the functions &quot;fn&quot; are continuous on &quot;A&quot;, then the series converges to a continuous function.

== Proof ==

Consider the sequence of functions
:formula_6 

Since the series formula_7 converges and for every , then by the Cauchy criterion,
:formula_8 
For the chosen ,
: formula_9
: formula_10
(Inequality (1) follows from the triangle inequality.)

The sequence is thus a Cauchy sequence in R or C, and by completeness, it converges to some number that depends on &quot;x&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot; we can write
: formula_11
Since &quot;N&quot; does not depend on &quot;x&quot;, this means that the sequence of partial sums converges uniformly to the function &quot;S&quot;. Hence, by definition, the series formula_12 converges uniformly.

Analogously, one can prove that formula_13 converges uniformly.

== Generalization ==
A more general version of the Weierstrass M-test holds if the common codomain of the functions (&quot;fn&quot;) is a Banach space, in which case the premise

:formula_1

is to be replaced by

:formula_15,

where formula_16 is the norm on the Banach space. For an example of the use of this test on a Banach space, see the article Fréchet derivative.

<text>Pease Pottage is a village in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex, England. It lies on the southern edge of the Crawley built-up area, in the civil parish of Slaugham.

The village has a motorway service station, named after the village, which also serves as a local shop for the residents of the village (a footpath was constructed to allow pedestrian access from the village). It is located at the junction of the M23 and the A23 on the London to Brighton road, where the A264 to Horsham joins.

The Church of the Ascension, a chapel of ease to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Slaugham, opened in 1875, but is no longer in use.

Pease Pottage Radar is about west of Pease Pottage and is visible from much of the village. It is an air traffic control radar for NATS and takes advantage of a position above sea level, some above the nearby Gatwick Airport.
==Etymology==
Pease Pottage is also an old name for pease pudding. It has been said that the village name came from serving this food to convicts either on their way from London to the South Coast or from East Grinstead to Horsham although this seems implausible and it is not clear why convicts would travel along either route. The name Peaspottage Gate first appears on Budgen&#x27;s Map of Sussex made in 1724 at the southern end of a road from Crawley where it met the Ridgeway, and is on the border of the parishes of Slaugham and Worth. This is prior to the turnpikes (1771), and so was not a toll gate. It was probably a gate between St Leonard&#x27;s Forest and Tilgate Forest (part of Worth Forest), and probably a reference to soft muddy ground. Many local villages have Gate as part of the name (Tilgate, Colgate, Faygate etc.). The name is not on John Speed&#x27;s map of 1610 (surveyed in the 1590s). Gate was dropped from the name when the tollgate was removed in 1877.

==Geography and history==
Pease Pottage is situated on the Forest Ridge of the High Weald. This ridge is formed from the resistant sandstones and thin clays of the Cretaceous Hastings Beds and stretches from Horsham in the west to reach the English Channel coast in the east between Hastings and Rye. The ridge is narrow to the west of Pease Pottage but widens to the east. Wet Weald Clay forms the low ground to the north and south of the ridge. The sandstone provides good drainage and many microliths have been found dating from the Mesolithic Age. The Horsham Culture is believed to have lasted about 2,000 years. Neolithic flints from the South Downs have been found to the east along Parish Lane. To the west are three Bronze Age tumuli.

Pease Pottage lies on an ancient, pre-Roman trackway that ran in an east to west direction along the Forest Ridge from Ashdown Forest through West Hoathly, Turners Hill and Pease Pottage to Horsham. This pre-historic ridgeway pre-dated the predominantly north–south-oriented Roman roads built by the Romans to link the south coast of England to London, and to connect with the strategically important Wealden iron industry, such as the London to Brighton trunk road east of Pease Pottage and Stane Street further to the west. The ridgeway, running as it did in an east–west direction across the Weald, was probably of long-standing importance and of great antiquity. The route can be traced on Ordnance Survey maps and can be discerned on the ground in various places e.g. as an old sunken trackway running through Worth Forest east of Pease Pottage.

The only evidence from Saxon times comes from the political structures. The Middle Saxons extended south from the Thames valley and created the sub-kingdom of Sudergeona (Surrey). The South Saxons populated the south coast. In between was a great forest known as the Andreaswald. The wet Wealden clay and dense undergrowth made this relatively inaccessible except by river, and so the Sussex Rapes were formed along the river valleys. The River Ouse was navigable for small boats from Lewes up to Cuckfield from where higher drier ground and less dense vegetation made progress north easier. Thus the Rape of Lewes extended as far north as modern Crawley. The rapes were sub-divided in hundreds, and the area now known as Pease Pottage was in the Hundred of Buttinghill. Slaugham is first mentioned around 1095 when the tithes were granted to the Priory of St Pancras in Lewes. The church dates from the early 12th century.

The first large scale map of Sussex by Christopher Saxton in 1575 shows Crawley and Slaugham churches, St. Leonard&#x27;s Forest and Worth Forest, but just white space between them. Speed&#x27;s map of 1610 (surveyed by John Nordon about 1595) also shows Slawgha and Crawley with the Rape border passing between Schelley Forest on the west and Tylgate Forest on the east. Neither map shows any roads. It is likely that the Ridgeway from Horsham was used as it is the only dry east–west route, but this went south to Handcross then east along High Street (round the headwaters of Standford Brook) to Turners Hill and onwards to East Grinstead. A shorter but wetter (probably impassable in the winter) shortcut developed along Parish Lane crossing Standford Brook at Cinder Banks. This is clearly shown on Budgen&#x27;s 1724 map which indicates a few buildings at Pease Pottage Gate with Buchan Hill to the west and a road north through Broadfield and Hogs Hill to Crawley. The road south to Handcross is not shown.

Cinder Banks takes its name from a double blast furnace known as Worth Furnace which was producing cannons in 1547 – a double furnace was required to produce enough iron for a cannon. Originally owned by Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, it passed to Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley when Norfolk was accused of treason. Seymour suffered the same fate, and an inventory of his property taken in 1550 gives detailed information of the furnace which included 29 guns and six tons of shot. The furnace produced cast iron, some of which was taken north to the Blackwater finery forge (now under Maidenbower) to be converted into wrought iron. The furnace closed in the early 17th century due to a shortage of iron ore and wood. Thomas Seymore in his brief ownership suggested building a new town in the nearby park of Bewbush.

The main route between London and Brighton was further east (in 1756 the London-Brighton stage coach went via East Grinstead and Lewes). A toll road from Crawley north to London was built in the early 18th century, but the road south to Brighton through Pease Pottage was not constructed until 1770. The Ridgeway (today known as Horsham Road and Forest Road) was turnpiked in 1771 being the main Horsham-Crawley road prior to the McAdam Road being built in 1823 (now the old route of the A264 – it would have been extremely wet before it was given a hard surface). There were two London-Brighton coaches a day in each direction in 1797.

In the early 19th century Hon. Thomas Erskine (Lord Chancellor 1806–1807), son of the Earl of Buchan purchased Buchan Hill in the early 19th century and built a house in the fork between the two roads descending from the north end of Grouse Road towards Bewbush and Gossops Green. Although it is widely believed that Buchan Hill was named after his father, the name is on Budgen&#x27;s map some 80 years earlier. The house is now the home of Cottesmore School. William Cobbett travelled the ridgeway on 31 July 1823., and wrote about it in his &quot;Rural Rides&quot;:

In &quot;Reminiscences of Horsham&quot; by Henry Burstow he states that on 4 October 1837 he went to Pease Pottage to see Queen Victoria pass through on her way from London to Brighton. There was &quot;a large archway made of evergreens, with VICTORIA REGINA worked on it in various coloured dahlias&quot;.

Pease Pottage would have benefited from the toll roads, but lost the Crawley-Horsham traffic in 1823 with the opening of the new McAdam road through Faygate, and the London and Brighton Railway completed in 1841 which skirted along the eastern boundary of Pease Pottage cutting through Tilgate Forest alongside Standford Brook and through a tunnel under High Street. The Pease Pottage tollgate was removed in 1877. In 1896 on the day after the red flag law expired, 25 cars left London for Brighton, but half had broken down by Crawley. This event is still celebrated in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run which still goes past Pease Pottage on the first Sunday in November.

The pub dates back to the 19th century. A pond in front of it was filled in 1883. A smithy was next door, and later a shop and a Jet petrol station opposite, with the Busy Bee restaurant behind. The Grapes pub (closed in 2008 and demolished in 2010) was further south, and had a tin church next to it. It was originally the toll house, and the name came from grapes grown in a greenhouse next door.

To the south of Pease Pottage is Tilgate Forest Row which had three shops, a blacksmith and post office. The Pease Pottage cricket field was between here and Pease Pottage (now a car breakers yard). The cricket field was made in 1874, but was ploughed up in 1939 as part of the war effort. It had a London horse-drawn tram as a pavilion. The ground was up to county ground standards.

The next major change to Pease Pottage was the opening of the M23 motorway in 1975 which continued as the A23 road, a two lane dual carriageway south to Handcross with the houses of Tilgate Forest Row facing onto it. The service station was opened in about 1990. The road layout was changed again in the mid-1990s with the A23 moved a few yards west and widened to three lanes. The old southbound carriageway became a new road to Handcross, and another new road was built on the other side of the A23 to Woodhurst. Tilgate Forest Row is now separated from Pease Pottage by ten traffic lanes.

A large number of houses have been built since 1946 when Pease Pottage consisted of a few buildings near the crossroads and a few isolated buildings on the A23. The first development was west along Horsham Road, mainly bungalows. This was followed by modern estates behind the Black Swan and to the west of the old A23 (now Brighton Road South). The last of these was on the site of Hemsleys nursery, south of which are Finches playing fields. Some apartments have been built on the old maintenance deport on the east side of Old Brighton Road North. The northern end of this cul-de-sac is in Crawley and there are now houses along the west side so the gap between Pease Pottage and Crawley has disappeared.

==Commercial activities==
There are a number of commercial activities in the village, including the large car breakers yard on Brighton Road. Just south of this was the British Airports Authority Management Centre, the site next occupied by the Crawley Forest School opened on 18 September 2009 by Gloria Hunniford. The school was registered as an independent special school and a children&#x27;s home with Ofsted. The registration was for a mixed provision (i.e. boys and girls) with an age range of 7–18 years and caters for 35 residential and 20-day pupils.

The site is now occupied by the controversial &#x27;Cedars&#x27; UK Borders Agency Detention Centre, housing families temporarily before deportation. This was opened as a response to objections to children being held at the Yarl&#x27;s Wood detention centre.

There are also large warehouses next to the old crossroads, and two small industrial parks – one between Brighton Road and the A23, and the other along Parish Lane. Finally there are some units at the golf driving range on the west of the village and the old Met Office site next door (which is strictly in Colgate).

==Country houses==
There are two country houses just outside the borders of Pease Pottage, but which have it as a postal address, and are accessed from the village.

The original house at Buchan Hill was built in the early 19th century by Hon. Thomas Erskine (Lord Chancellor in 1806). His father was the Earl of Buchan from which it may have taken its name, although Buchan Hill is named on Richard Budgen&#x27;s map of 1724, and its name may have attracted him. This house was built in a fork between two roads running north towards Bewbush and Gossops Green. Today the right of way descends along the west branch as far as the site of the old house, turns east across the front of it then north along the east branch. John Jervis Broadwood (a descendant of John Broadwood) occupied it in the 1860s.

The new Buchan House was built in 1883 by Philip Feril Renault Saillard who made his money from a new dye used for ostrich feathers. It was located NE of the original which was subsequently demolished, and had three drives – north, south and east. The latter linked it with the London-Brighton road, and runs along the border between Slaugham and Crawley. It cost £40000. It was designed by the London partnership of Ernest George and Harold Peto, and Sir Edwin Lutyens was also involved. The house was occupied by his daughter after his death in 1915 and subsequently was bought by Upland House School. It was occupied by the Pearl Assurance Company before the Second World War, then housed Canadian Army Officers (there was a Canadian Army Camp north of Horsham Road), since when it has been used by Cottesmore School.

Woodhurst was constructed as a country house in the early 19th century. It was just off the A23, but now is at the southern end of Old Brighton Road South, and is really in Handcross although it cannot be accessed from there. It was owned by Dame Margot Fonteyn and used as a ballet school. During World War 2 it was occupied by the Canadian army and was later used by the NHS as Woodhurst Hospital (there are several postcards of this taken in 1955), and later 55 older people with learning difficulties living in residential care provided by Surrey Oaklands NHS Trust. This closed in 2003, and the site is being developed as a Diagnostic and Treatment Centre and Care Home by Sussex Health Care.

==In popular culture==
Pease Pottage featured in the 1953 film &quot;Genevieve&quot; as a very remote village deep in the Sussex countryside.

The fictional &quot;Doctor Who&quot; character Melanie Jane Bush lived at 36 Downview Crescent before joining the Sixth Doctor as a companion in the 23rd season. The town and its history feature prominently in the audio story &quot;&quot;.

Pease Pottage was also featured in the 1911 novel &quot;The Four Men: A Farrago&quot; by Hilaire Belloc as the starting point of a side road.

==Notable people==
*Albert Cordingley (1871-1939), first-class cricketer
*Edward Thornton (1893-1970), first-class cricketer and military officer

<text>Oenology (also enology; ) is the science and study of wine and winemaking. Oenology is distinct from viticulture, which is the science of the growing, cultivation, and harvesting of grapes. The English word oenology derives from the Greek word &quot;oinos&quot; () &quot;wine&quot; and the suffix &quot;–logia&quot; () the &quot;study of&quot;. An oenologist is an expert in the science of wine and of the arts and techniques for making wine.

==Education and training==
University programs in oenology and viticulture usually feature a concentration in science for the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S, B.Sc., Sc.B), and as a terminal master&#x27;s degree — either in a scientific or in a research program for the degree of Master of Science (M.S., Sc.M.), e.g. the master of professional studies degree. Oenologists and viticulturalists with doctorates often have a background in horticulture, plant physiology, and microbiology.
Related to oenology are the professional titles of &quot;sommelier&quot; and master of wine, which are specific certifications in the restaurant business and in hospitality management. Occupationally, oenologists usually work as winemakers, as wine chemists in commercial laboratories, and in oenologic organisations, such as the Australian Wine Research Institute.

===Australia===
Schools in Australia tend to offer a &quot;bachelor of viticulture&quot; or &quot;master of viticulture&quot; degree.

<doc id="444477" wikidata="Q1070443" url="?curid=444477" title="Mydoom">
<text>Mydoom was a computer worm that targeted computers running Microsoft Windows. It was first sighted on January 26, 2004. It became the fastest-spreading e-mail worm ever, exceeding previous records set by the Sobig worm and ILOVEYOU, a record which as of 2025 has yet to be surpassed.

Mydoom appears to have been commissioned by e-mail spammers to send junk e-mail through infected computers. The worm contains the text message &quot;Andy; I&#x27;m just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry,&quot; leading many to believe that the worm&#x27;s creator was paid. Early on, several security firms expressed their belief that the worm originated from a programmer in Russia. The actual author of the worm is unknown.

The worm appeared to be a poorly sent e-mail, and most people who originally were e-mailed the worm ignored it, thinking it was spam. However, it eventually spread to infect at least 500 thousand computers across the globe.

Speculative early coverage held that the sole purpose of the worm was to perpetrate a distributed denial-of-service attack against SCO Group. 25 percent of Mydoom.A-infected hosts targeted SCO Group with a flood of traffic. Trade press conjecture, spurred on by SCO Group&#x27;s own claims, held that this meant the worm was created by a Linux or open source supporter in retaliation for SCO Group&#x27;s controversial legal actions and public statements against Linux. This theory was rejected immediately by security researchers. Since then, it has been likewise rejected by law enforcement agents investigating the virus, who attribute it to organized online crime gangs.

Mydoom was named by Craig Schmugar, an employee of computer security firm McAfee and one of the earliest discoverers of the worm. Schmugar chose the name after noticing the text &quot;mydom&quot; within a line of the program&#x27;s code. He noted: &quot;It was evident early on that this would be very big. I thought having &#x27;doom&#x27; in the name would be appropriate.&quot;

==Technical overview==
Mydoom is primarily transmitted via e-mail, appearing as a transmission error, with subject lines including &quot;Error&quot;, &quot;Mail Delivery System&quot;, &quot;Test&quot; or &quot;Mail Transaction Failed&quot; in different languages, including English and French. The mail contains an attachment that, if executed, resends the worm to e-mail addresses found in local files such as a user&#x27;s address book. It also copies itself to the &quot;shared folder&quot; of peer-to-peer file sharing application Kazaa in an attempt to spread that way.

Mydoom avoids targeting e-mail addresses at certain universities, such as Rutgers, MIT, Stanford and UC Berkeley, as well as certain companies such as Microsoft and Symantec. Some early reports claimed the worm avoids &quot;all&quot; .edu addresses, but this is not the case.

The original version, Mydoom.A, is described as carrying two payloads:

* A backdoor on port 3127/tcp to allow remote control of the subverted PC (by putting its own SHIMGAPI.DLL file in the system32 directory and launching it as a child process of Windows Explorer); this is essentially the same backdoor used by Mimail.
* A denial-of-service attack against the website of the controversial company SCO Group, timed to commence 1 February 2004. Many virus analysts doubted if this payload would actually function. Later testing suggests that it functions in only 25% of infected systems.

A second version, Mydoom.B, as well as carrying the original payloads, also targets the Microsoft website and blocks access to Microsoft sites and popular online antivirus sites by modifying the hosts file, thus blocking virus removal tools or updates to antivirus software. The smaller number of copies of this version in circulation meant that Microsoft&#x27;s servers suffered few ill effects.

==Timeline==

* 26 January 2004: The Mydoom virus is first identified around 8am EST (1300 UTC), just before the beginning of the workday in North America. The earliest messages originate from Russia. For a period of a few hours mid-day, the worm&#x27;s rapid spread slows overall internet performance by approximately ten percent and average web page load times by approximately fifty percent. Computer security companies report that Mydoom is responsible for approximately one in ten e-mail messages at this time.
:Although Mydoom&#x27;s Denial of Service (DoS) attack was scheduled to begin on 1 February 2004, SCO Group&#x27;s website goes offline briefly in the hours after the worm is first released. It is unclear whether Mydoom was responsible for this. SCO Group claimed it was the target of several distributed denial of service attacks in 2003 that were unrelated to computer viruses.
* 27 January 2004: SCO Group offers a US$250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the worm&#x27;s creator. In the US, the FBI and the Secret Service begin investigations into the worm.
* 28 January 2004: A second version of the worm is discovered two days after the initial attack. The first messages sent by Mydoom.B are identified at around 1400 UTC and also appear to originate from Russia. The new version includes the original denial of service attack against SCO Group and an identical attack aimed at Microsoft.com beginning on 3 February 2004; however, both attacks are suspected to be either broken, or non-functional decoy code intended to conceal the backdoor function of Mydoom. Mydoom.B also blocks access to the websites of over 60 computer security companies, as well as pop-up advertisements provided by DoubleClick and other online marketing companies.
:The spread of Mydoom peaks; computer security companies report that Mydoom is responsible for roughly one in five e-mail messages at this time.
* 29 January 2004: The spread of Mydoom begins to decline as bugs in Mydoom.B&#x27;s code prevent it from spreading as rapidly as first anticipated. Microsoft offers US$250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the creator of Mydoom.B.
* 1 February 2004: An estimated one million computers around the world infected with Mydoom begin the virus&#x27;s massive distributed denial of service attack—the largest such attack to date. As 1 February arrives in East Asia and Australia, SCO removes www.sco.com from the DNS around 1700 UTC on 31 January. (There is as yet no independent confirmation of www.sco.com in fact suffering the planned DDOS.)
* 3 February 2004: Mydoom.B&#x27;s distributed denial of service attack on Microsoft begins, for which Microsoft prepares by offering a website which will not be affected by the worm, information.microsoft.com. However, the impact of the attack remains minimal and www.microsoft.com remains functional. This is attributed to the comparatively low distribution of the Mydoom.B variant, the high load tolerance of Microsoft&#x27;s web servers and precautions taken by the company. Some experts point out that the burden is less than that of Microsoft software updates and other such web-based services.
* 9 February 2004: Doomjuice, a “parasitic” worm, begins spreading. This worm uses the backdoor left by Mydoom to spread. It does not attack non-infected computers. Its payload, akin to one of Mydoom.B&#x27;s, is a denial-of-service attack against Microsoft.
* 12 February 2004: Mydoom.A is programmed to stop spreading. However, the backdoor remains open after this date.
* 1 March 2004: Mydoom.B is programmed to stop spreading; as with Mydoom.A, the backdoor remains open.
* 26 July 2004: A variant of Mydoom attacks Google, AltaVista and Lycos, completely stopping the function of the popular Google search engine for the larger portion of the workday, and creating noticeable slow-downs in the AltaVista and Lycos engines for hours.
* 23 September 2004: Mydoom versions U, V, W and X appear, sparking worries that a new, more powerful Mydoom is being prepared.
* 18 February 2005: Mydoom version AO appears.
* July 2009: Mydoom resurfaces in the July 2009 cyber attacks affecting South Korea and the United States.

<text>Aerobiz is a business simulation video game for the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis game consoles, released in 1992 by Koei. It was also released for the FM Towns, PC-9801 and X68000 computer platforms in Japan.

As CEO of a budding international airline, the player has a limited amount of time to expand their business to become the industry leader against three other airlines (either AI-controlled or human opponents). The player has an amount of control over how their airline develops, such as the name, investments, what routes to fly, plane purchases, and other various aspects, while at the mercy of world events such as politics (for instance, choosing to run an airline out of Moscow will restrict the player to buying only Soviet planes, and will make negotiating with Western nations more difficult) and natural disasters. The player can also get the company involved in peripheral businesses such as hotels and shuttle services. Once Perestroika is initiated, then the Cold War restrictions no longer apply in the game.

The sequel &quot;Aerobiz Supersonic&quot; was released in August 1994 for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis. The player is presented with a wider variety of options in nearly everything. Another sequel known as &quot;Air Management &#x27;96&quot; was released only in Japan for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Aerobiz&quot; features two timeframes to play the game through: 1963 to 1995, and 1983 to 2015. After selecting the timeframe, the players then choose a city for their airline&#x27;s headquarters. This allows a certain amount of handicapping: some cities, such as New York, London, and Tokyo, start the player with many airplanes and a large amount of money; others, such as Lima, Nairobi, and Honolulu, start the player with only a couple of airplanes and a small amount of money. The players then select a difficulty level, which affects the number of passengers, world events (and the reactions of the passengers to those world events), and the win conditions. A charter system of independent airlines can have their shares bought or sold on the stock market; owning at least 51% of the company makes it eligible to be assimilated into the main airline.

The gameplay is superficially straightforward: players negotiate for access slots at each airport, buy airplanes, then open routes and start business. After each player has made their desired moves, the game shows any world events that affect the players (for instance, a labor strike will delay shipments of aircraft from that company, while the Olympic Games will boost traffic worldwide, particularly to the host city). The game then shows the results of direct competition between airlines flying the same routes, then the quarterly results of sales, expenses, profits, and passengers flown. After the January–March quarter of every year, it also shows annual results. There are elements of enhancing airline service, such as improving the convenience of arrivals/departures, along with reductions in fare, improving the quality of service along with advertising campaigns.

The game is won by the first player to achieve the win conditions: link all 22 cities and carry a certain number of passengers (between 2.5 million and 4.5 million, based on difficulty level), all while remaining profitable. If a player goes for four quarters with a negative balance, the company is declared bankrupt and offered reorganization. If the game goes for 32 years (128 turns) without any player meeting the win conditions, the game is called a loss.

===Scenarios===
; Scenario 1
: This scenario starts in 1963 with the intense competition for the airlines heating up with aircraft that can fly for longer distances without re-fueling. All airlines are desperately trying to cross the long Pacific Ocean in the quest for intercontinental superiority.
; Scenario 2
: This scenario starts in 1983 with the supersonic airplane becoming the hottest topic in the airline industry.

==Reception==
&quot;MegaTech&quot; magazine said the game had massive potential, and that &quot;strategy buffs will cream over it&quot;. Super Gamer reviewed the SNES version and gave an overall score of 81% writing: &quot;This puts you in charge of an airline, buying aircraft, routes, hotels, advertising, and even choosing whether to skimp on repairs!&quot;

==Remake==
A remake of this game was made for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Windows PC called Air Management &#x27;96. Graphics have been enhanced in this version, but it is only available in Japanese.

<doc id="444482" wikidata="Q1091212" url="?curid=444482" title="Folkung">
<text>In modern Swedish, Folkung has two meanings, which appear to be opposites:

# The medieval &quot;House of Bjälbo&quot; in Sweden, which produced several Swedish statesmen and kings. 
# A group of people (singular &quot;Folkunge&quot;, plural &quot;Folkungar&quot;), who were at times in political opposition to the same House of Bjälbo. This &quot;political party&quot; fought for the ancient right of free men to elect the kings in Sweden.

Until the 17th century, &quot;Folkunge&quot; was used only with the second meaning. However, many of these political opponents were also said to have been descendants of Jarl Folke the Fat (from the House of Bjälbo), who lived before the family became royal. Hence, in the 17th century, the whole family, then already extinct and without any established name, became known as the House of Folkung (&quot;Folkungaätten&quot; in Swedish).

Later research, though, showed that the political Folkungs were not just descendants of Jarl Folke—instead, they belonged to different Swedish noble families, united by the ambition to fight against a central ruler of Sweden. According to one theory, Folkungs wanted to keep the old &quot;freedom&quot; of the petty kingdoms, including the election of kings, and to retain local power in their own control. Many Folkungs came from the ancient provinces of Svealand, opposing the ruling families of the time that were mostly from Götaland. The first Folkung uprising in 1229 was successful, elevating Canute II onto the throne. Later developments were less promising, and the centralized system eventually suppressed their resistance.

<doc id="444486" wikidata="Q965093" url="?curid=444486" title="Mormon fundamentalism">
<text>Mormon fundamentalism (also called fundamentalist Mormonism) is a belief in the validity of selected fundamental aspects of Mormonism as taught and practiced in the nineteenth century, particularly during the administrations of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and John Taylor, the first three presidents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Mormon fundamentalists seek to uphold tenets and practices no longer held by mainstream Mormons. The principle most often associated with Mormon fundamentalism is plural marriage, a form of polygyny first taught in the Latter Day Saint movement by the movement&#x27;s founder, Smith. A second and closely associated principle is that of the United Order, a form of egalitarian communalism. Mormon fundamentalists believe that these and other principles were wrongly abandoned or changed by the LDS Church in its efforts to become reconciled with mainstream American society. Today, the LDS Church excommunicates any of its members who practice plural marriage or who otherwise closely associate themselves with Mormon fundamentalist practices.

There is no single authority accepted by all Mormon fundamentalists; viewpoints and practices of individual groups vary. Fundamentalists have formed numerous small sects, often within cohesive and isolated communities throughout the Mormon Corridor in the Western United States, Western Canada, and northern Mexico. At times, sources have claimed there are as many as 60,000 Mormon fundamentalists in the United States, with fewer than half of them living in polygamous households. However, others have suggested that there may be as few as 20,000 Mormon fundamentalists with only 8,000 to 15,000 practicing polygamy. Independent Mormon fundamentalist Anne Wilde investigated demographics and, in 2005, produced estimates that fell between the prior two sources, indicating there to be 35–40,000 fundamentalists at the time.

Founders of mutually rival Mormon fundamentalist denominations include Lorin C. Woolley, John Y. Barlow, Joseph W. Musser, Leroy S. Johnson, Rulon C. Allred, Elden Kingston, and Joel LeBaron. The largest Mormon fundamentalist groups are the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB).

==History==
The LDS Church began prohibiting the contracting of plural marriages within the United States in 1890 after a decree by church president Wilford Woodruff. However, the practice continued underground in the U.S. and openly in Mormon colonies in northern Mexico and southern Alberta. According to some sources, many polygamous men in the United States continued to live with their plural wives with the approval of church presidents Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, and Joseph F. Smith.

Some fundamentalists have argued that the 1890 Manifesto was not a real revelation of the kind given by God to Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, and others, but that it was rather a politically expedient document intended by Woodruff to be a temporary measure until Utah Territory gained statehood. They make their argument based on textual evidence and the fact that the &quot;Manifesto&quot; is not worded in accordance with similar revelations in the LDS scriptures. This argument further holds that after joining the Union, Utah would have had the authority to enact its own laws with respect to marriage, rather than being bound by U.S. territorial laws that prohibited polygamy. Before statehood could be granted in 1896, however, the federal government required Utah to include a provision in its state constitution stating that &quot;polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited.&quot; Fundamentalists (and many scholars of Mormon history) also believe that a primary impetus for the 1890 Manifesto was the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887, a stringent federal law that legally dissolved the LDS Church, disenfranchised women (who had been given the vote in Utah in 1870), and required voters to take an anti-polygamy oath before being permitted to vote in an election.

With the selection of Latter-day Saint Reed Smoot to be one of Utah&#x27;s representatives to the U.S. Senate in 1903, national attention was again focused on the continuation of plural marriage in Utah, which culminated in the Reed Smoot hearings. In 1904, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a &quot;Second Manifesto&quot;, after which time it became LDS Church policy to excommunicate those church members who entered into or solemnized new polygamous marriages. The seriousness with which this new measure was taken is evinced in the fact that apostle John W. Taylor, son of the church&#x27;s third president, was excommunicated in 1911 for his continued opposition to the Manifesto.

Today, the LDS Church continues to excommunicate members who advocate early Mormon doctrines such as plural marriage, enter into or solemnize plural marriages (whether in the United States or elsewhere), or actively support Mormon fundamentalist or dissident groups. Although some LDS Church members continue to &quot;believe&quot; in the doctrine of plural marriage without &quot;practicing&quot; it, Joseph Smith&#x27;s teachings on plural marriage remain part of the scriptural canon of the LDS Church. The LDS Church prevents any of its members who sympathize with Mormon fundamentalist teachings from entering its temples.

During the 1920s, a church dissenter named Lorin C. Woolley claimed a separate line of priesthood authority from the LDS Church&#x27;s hierarchy, effectively setting in motion the development of Mormon fundamentalism. Most of the Mormon polygamous groups can trace their roots to Woolley&#x27;s legacy.

For the most part, the Utah state government has left the Mormon fundamentalists to themselves, unless their practices violate laws other than those prohibiting bigamy. For example, there have been recent prosecutions of men who belong to fundamentalist groups for marrying underage girls. In one highly publicized 2004 case, a man and one of his polygamist wives lost custody of all but one of their children until the wife separated herself from her husband. The largest government effort to crack down on the practices of fundamentalist Mormons was carried out in 1953 in what is today Colorado City, Arizona, which became known as the Short Creek Raid.

Other fundamental doctrines of the Latter Day Saint movement besides polygamy, notably the United Order (communalism), while equally important in the practices of some fundamentalist sects, have not come under the same scrutiny or approbation as has plural marriage, and the mainline LDS Church has mostly ignored this aspect of fundamentalism; in any case, no revelation or statement condemning it has ever been issued.

==Distinctive doctrines and practices==
Most Mormon fundamentalists embrace the term &quot;Fundamentalist&quot; (usually capitalized). Mormon fundamentalists share certain commonalities with other fundamentalist movements, but also possess some clear distinctions of their own.

Fundamentalists within the Mormon tradition do see religious authority as inerrant and unchanging, but tend to locate this authority within their view of &quot;Priesthood&quot;, which is conceived of as more of a charismatic authority and often physical lineage than an external organization. In this view, ordination lineage becomes all-important and an external organization such as a church may &quot;lose&quot; its theological authority while the &quot;priesthood&quot; (conceived in this abstract and individualistic sense) may continue via an alternative lineage. Mormon fundamentalists frequently assert that priesthood is prior to the Church.

Unlike more prevalent Biblical (non-Mormon) fundamentalist groups, who generally base their authority on an unchanging and closed canon of scripture, Mormon fundamentalists generally hold to a concept of &quot;continuing revelation&quot; or &quot;progressive revelation,&quot; in which the canon of scripture may be continually augmented through the sermons and teachings of prophets whose preaching guides the community.

Another of the most basic beliefs of Mormon fundamentalist groups is that of plural marriage, which many of them view as essential for obtaining the highest degree of exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Mormon fundamentalists dislike the term &quot;polygamy&quot; and view &quot;polygyny&quot; as a term used only by outsiders. They also refer to plural marriage generically as &quot;the Principle&quot;, &quot;celestial marriage&quot;, &quot;the New and Everlasting Covenant&quot;, or &quot;the Priesthood Work.&quot;

The practice of plural marriage usually differs little from the manner in which it was practiced in the nineteenth century. However, in some fundamentalist sects it is considered acceptable for an older man to marry underage girls as soon as they attain puberty. This practice, which is illegal in most states, apart from polygamy itself, has generated public controversy. Examples include the Tom Green case, and the case in which a man from the Kingston Group married his 15-year-old cousin, who was also his aunt. Other sects, however, do not practice and may in fact vehemently denounce underage or forced marriages and incest (for example, the Apostolic United Brethren.)

In addition to plural marriage, Mormon fundamentalist beliefs often include the following principles:
* the law of consecration also known as the United Order
* the Adam–God teachings taught by Brigham Young and other early leaders of the LDS Church
* the principle of blood atonement
* the exclusion of black men from the priesthood
* the belief that missionaries should teach &quot;without purse or scrip&quot;

Mormon fundamentalists believe both that these principles were accepted by the LDS Church at one time, and that the LDS Church wrongly abandoned or changed them, in large part due to the desire of its leadership and members to assimilate into mainstream American society and avoid the persecutions and conflict that had characterized the church throughout its early years.

==Terminology and relationship with the LDS Church==
The term &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot; appears to have been coined in the 1940s by LDS Church apostle Mark E. Petersen to refer to groups who had left the LDS Church. However, Mormon fundamentalists do not universally embrace this usage and many simply consider themselves to be &quot;Mormon&quot;. Today, the LDS Church considers the designation &quot;Mormon&quot; to apply only to its own members and not to members of other sects of the Latter Day Saint movement. One LDS leader went as far as claiming that there is no such thing as a &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot;, and that using the two terms together is a &quot;contradiction.&quot; The LDS Church suggests that the correct term to describe Mormon fundamentalist groups is &quot;polygamist communities&quot;.

In rebuttal to this nomenclature argument, certain Mormon fundamentalists have argued that they themselves are in fact more correctly designated as Mormons in so far as they follow what they consider to be the true and original Mormon teachings as handed down from Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. Within this context, the LDS Church is often regarded by such fundamentalists as having abandoned several foundational aspects of Mormonism as noted above.

==Mormon fundamentalist sects==

The majority of Mormon fundamentalists belong to sects that have separated themselves from the LDS Church. As such, most are considered to be &quot;Brighamite&quot; sects within the Latter Day Saint movement.

===Apostolic United Brethren===
The Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) is estimated to have about 5000 to 10000 members throughout Utah, Montana, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, Missouri, and Mexico and is perhaps the largest Mormon fundamentalist group. Several of its towns are organized into United Orders; the church has established a temple in Mexico, an Endowment House in Utah, and operates several schools.

The AUB emerged when their leader, Joseph W. Musser, ordained Rulon C. Allred as an apostle and counselor, which led to a split between Mormon fundamentalists in Salt Lake City and those in Short Creek, Arizona. 

The AUB is one of the more liberal of the Mormon groups practicing plural marriage. The leaders of the AUB do not arrange marriages nor do they authorize plural marriages for people under 18 or for those who are closely related.

===Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints===

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) is estimated to consist of 6000 members. A succession crisis has been brewing in the church since 2002, when Warren Jeffs (convicted of accessory to rape and sentenced to life in prison in 2011), became president of the church. There has been extensive litigation regarding the church, as property rights of disaffected members are weighed against the decisions of church leaders who hold trust to the land their homes are built on. A large concentration of members lives in the twin cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, as well as in Bountiful, British Columbia. The church built a temple near Eldorado, Texas. The members of the FLDS Church tend to be very conservative in dress and lifestyle.

Beginning April 4, 2008, over a four-day period, troopers and child welfare officials searched the church&#x27;s YFZ Ranch and removed 416 children into the temporary custody of the State of Texas. Originally officials from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services took 18 girls into temporary custody of the state, after responding to a phone call from the YFZ ranch alleging physical and sexual abuse of a 16-year-old girl, who also claimed to have been married at age 15 to a 49-year-old man. On the following day, Judge Barbara Walther of the 51st District Court issued an order authorizing officials to remove all children, including boys, 17 years old and under out of the compound. The children were being held by the Child Protective Services 45 miles away, north of the ranch. 133 women also voluntarily left the ranch with the children. On May 29, 2008 the Texas Supreme Court ruled that CPS must return all of the children. The court stated, &quot;On the record before us, removal of the children was not warranted.&quot; The call that provoked the raid was a hoax. Despite this, investigations resulting from this raid resulted in charges against twelve men associated with the FLDS Church, six of which have resulted in convictions ranging from 5 to 75 years in prison.

The considerable hardship faced by wives and children pursuant to state evictions has been reported, with testimonies of those affected. The story of Warren Jeffs and the FLDS Church has been popularized in the Netflix documentary, &quot;Keep Sweet, Pray and Obey&quot;. The treatment of the wives of Warren Jeffs has been discussed by testimony from escapees, who established a women&#x27;s refuge in Church property.

===Bountiful, British Columbia Community===

The first member of the group that bought property near Lister was Harold (aka) Michael Blackmore, who moved there with his family in 1946. Other members of the church who believed in the principles of plural marriages soon followed. After Winston Blackmore became the bishop in the 1980s, the group took the name of Bountiful.

In 1998 the estimated population was 600 and has since grown to about 1,000. Most of the residents are descended from only half a dozen men. The current FLDS bishop is James Oler.

In 2002 the Mormon fundamentalists in Bountiful divided into two groups: about half are members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church), and the other half are members of the Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc.

====Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc.====
The Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc., is an FLDS-offshoot based on the teachings of Winston Blackmore, who split with the FLDS Church after concluding the president of the church, Warren Jeffs, had exceeded his authority and become too dictatorial. This group was formed in September 2002, when FLDS Church president Warren Jeffs excommunicated Winston Blackmore, who was Bishop of the Bountiful, British Columbia group of the FLDS Church for two decades. About 700 people continue to follow Blackmore, while about 500 follow Jeffs.

===Latter Day Church of Christ (Davis County Cooperative Society or Kingston Group)===
The Davis County Cooperative Society, known internally as &quot;the Order&quot; short for &quot;the United Order,&quot; has a religious arm officially known as the Latter Day Church of Christ. The group is estimated to have approximately 3500-5000 members. This co-operative runs several businesses, including pawnshops and restaurant supply stores.

===Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a group of approximately 100 to 200 people; most live near Modena, Utah, or Tonopah, Nevada. The Righteous Branch was organized in 1978 by Gerald Peterson Sr., who claimed that he was ordained a High Priest Apostle by AUB leader Rulon C. Allred. Later, after he was murdered, Rulon C. Allred appeared to him as an angel to instruct him to preside over the keys of the priesthood. This church has built a pyramid-shaped temple and Gerald Peterson Jr. is their current leader. Like the AUB they are modern in their dress and do not allow girls under 18 to be married.

===True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days===
The True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (TLC) is headquartered in Manti, Utah. Membership is estimated at 300 to 500. Organized in 1994, the TLC was a new &quot;restoration&quot; for the &quot;very last days&quot; before the Second Coming of Jesus. While the church initially grew rapidly, it has since stagnated and declined in numbers and converts since it ceased missionary efforts in 2000.

===Centennial Park group===
About 1,500 people are members of a group located in Centennial Park, Arizona, called The Work of Jesus Christ. In the early 1980s there was a conflict of leadership in the FLDS Church. Some of the members were very unhappy with the changes being made by various influential men in the community. When the FLDS Church abandoned leadership by council and instituted a &quot;one-man rule&quot; doctrine, those who wanted to maintain leadership by a priesthood council founded Centennial Park in 1986, approximately 3 miles (5 km) south of the twin communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah. (Location of Centennial Park).

The name &quot;Centennial Park&quot; is a reference to the 1886 movement led by Lorin C. Woolley, which serves as the basis for fundamentalist claims of priesthood authority. Members of this group (referred to by members as &quot;The Work&quot;) denounce all violence and abuse, do not permit marriage of young girls, and disavow the extreme practices of the FLDS Church. However, like the FLDS Church, they practice a form of arranged marriage. They dress in modern, modest attire.

The Centennial Park group has built a meetinghouse for weekly services and a private high school. A charter school was built in 2003 for the town&#x27;s growing elementary-age population. About 300 members of this group live in the Salt Lake Valley, where they hold meetings monthly. Members living in Salt Lake City often travel to Centennial Park every month to help in building the community. This group is led by a Priesthood council.

The group was profiled on the ABC television program Primetime in a story entitled, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, and also on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Kingdom of God===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Kingdom of God is based in the Salt Lake Valley, and has around 200 members. The sect was founded by Frank Naylor and Ivan Nielson, who split from the Centennial Park group, another fundamentalist church. This group trace their authority through Alma A. Timpson and Frank Naylor. The church is estimated to have 200-300 members, most of whom reside in the Salt Lake Valley. Most—if not all—of the members of this group were previously associated with the Centennial Park or FLDS Church. The group is also known as the &quot;Third Ward&quot; or the &quot;Naylor group&quot;, after Frank Naylor.

===School of the Prophets===
The School of the Prophets has its headquarters in the Salem, Utah area. In 1968 Robert C. Crossfield published revelations he had alleged received in the &quot;Book of Onias&quot;. Among among other things, the &quot;Book&quot; chastised certain LDS Church leaders. Crossfield was excommunicated from the mainline LDS church in 1972. In 1982 Crossfield established a School of the Prophets, overseen by a president and six counselors. Crossfield&#x27;s continuing revelations were later named the &quot;Second Book of Commandments&quot;; it has 275 sections, dating from 1961 to 2018. There is a 2BC Website maintained by Crossfield devotees, which contains information on his teachings. 

Brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty were affiliated with the Crossfield group, serving as for a month as counselors in the Provo, Utah School of the Prophets in March 1984. Four months after being removed from the School of Prophets following a dispute with Crossfield from the school, they murdered their sister-in-law and her young daughter. Both Lafferty brothers were found guilty; Dan was sentenced to life with no parole, and Ron was sentenced to death but died of age-related complications before execution was carried out.

===Independent Mormon fundamentalists===
There is a small movement of independent Mormon fundamentalists. Independents do not belong to organized fundamentalist groups and do not generally recognize any man as their prophet or leader. Because Independents are not one cohesive group, they are very diverse in their beliefs and interpretations of Mormonism; therefore, their practices vary. Many Independents come from a background in the LDS Church, while others come from other Christian or Mormon fundamentalist backgrounds.

Independents rely on personal inspiration and revelation to guide them; there is no ecclesiastical structure among the Independents, although Independents often socialize with each other and may meet together for religious services.

Statistically, it is difficult to estimate how many Independents there are, but a 2014 estimate indicates that there may be more independent fundamentalists than there are in any one of the formally organized polygamous groups and may number as many as 15,000. According to this informal survey, about half of Mormon fundamentalists, both those in groups and those outside of groups, currently practice polygamy. There are many Independents in Utah, Arizona, Missouri and Brazil.

Two prominent figures among independent fundamentalists are the late writer Ogden Kraut as well as his plural wife Anne Wilde, both of whom maintained friendships with other independent fundamentalists and some members of the organized groups. Kraut justified his habits by arguing that John Taylor&#x27;s purported 1886 revalation authorized only continuing plural marriage, with &quot;no mention of setting up a church, taking tithing, having weekly meetings, or setting up a colony somewhere&quot;.

<doc id="444488" wikidata="Q2559651" url="?curid=444488" title="Woodstock, New Brunswick">
<text>Woodstock is a town in Carleton County, New Brunswick, Canada on the Saint John River, 103 km (65 miles) upriver from Fredericton at the mouth of the Meduxnekeag River. It is near the Canada–United States border and Houlton, Maine and the intersection of Interstate 95 and the Trans-Canada Highway making it a transportation hub. It is also a service centre for the potato industry and for more than 26,000 people in the nearby communities of Hartland, Florenceville-Bristol, Centreville, Bath and Lakeland Ridges for shopping, employment and entertainment.

Woodstock was possibly named after Woodstock, Oxfordshire. The name is Old English in origin, meaning a &quot;clearing in the woods&quot;. New Brunswick historian William Francis Ganong believed the parish (and later town) was named in honour of Viscount Woodstock, a junior title of the Duke of Portland, Prime Minister of Great Britain when the Loyalists arrived in New Brunswick.

On 1 January 2023, Woodstock expanded in all directions, annexing all or part of six local service districts. Revised census figures have not been released.

== History ==
Little is known of the area before it was settled by disbanded veterans of De Lancey&#x27;s Brigade following the American Revolutionary War. The veterans moved there in late 1783. The 26,000 acres grant was to 110 men. Not all took up the offer, and of those who did, not all stayed. By 1790 only 23 families were present, and by 1804 only 10 of the original men had possession of the land. According to the diaries of Frederick Dibblee mills were present from 1805. Export of timber via the Saint John river began about this time.

When Carleton County was created in 1831, Woodstock was made county seat, and a jail, court house and registry office were installed. From 1837 William Teel Baird operated a pharmacy. The first steamboat from Fredericton reached Woodstock in 1837 and a regular service was established in 1845. By 1847 the population was at 2,000 and the town had four churches, a bank, and a grammar school.

On The Twelfth (Orangemen&#x27;s Day) of July 1847 a riot took place at the corner of Victoria and Boyne streets near the site of the Orange Hall, built in 1848 and now a vacant lot. It was a conflict between Protestant Irish immigrants of the Orange Order and Catholic Irish immigrants. Around 250 Orangemen clashed with an equal number of Irish Catholics, leading to 10 deaths and many more injuries. It was a result of years of tensions. Subsequently, only Catholics were brought to trial.

According to the 1851, census there were 488 inhabited houses, and nine places of worship. Immigration was important, with the majority coming from Ireland.

The town was the first in New Brunswick to be incorporated, in 1856. The first mayor was Lewis P. Fisher. He made provisions in his will for the building of several educational institutions, among them the first Agricultural and Vocational School in Canada, and the L. P. Fisher Public Library.
In 1861, the newly built railway between St. Andrews and Woodstock was seized by several hundred navvies, angry at not being paid. A peaceful settlement was later made personally by Arthur Hamilton-Gordon.

The first telephone was installed in 1885 by H.V. Dalling, a homemade telephone whose wires ran between his home and shop. The Bell Telephone Company later opened a small telephone exchange in his store.

In 1887, Tappan Adney, visiting Woodstock, learnt birchbark canoe construction from a Maliseet, preserving and document the building process.

The headquarters for the New Brunswick Railway were here from 1870 until it ceased functioning.

The first dam at the mouth of the Meduxnekeag River was built in 1886. In the 1880s Woodstock had two small electric companies related to the Small &amp; Fisher and Connell Brothers iron foundries. These were superseded by the Woodstock Electric Railway Light and Power Company which in 1906 built a dam and a powerhouse on the Meduxnekeag for distribution of power to the town. The first hydro-electric station in New Brunswick, the Hayden dam and its power station was destroyed by a freshet in 1923, which also washed out the bridge that crossed the Meduxnekeag.

==Culture &amp; recreation==
In 1995, the Town of Woodstock opened the Carleton Civic Centre. The multipurpose complex houses a 25-metre (27 yard) indoor swimming pool, an 846-seat arena, a fitness centre, and community meeting rooms. The Woodstock Slammers of the Maritime Junior Hockey League played previously at the Ayr Motor Centre.

The annual Woodstock Old Home Week activities are centered around Woodstock and the fair grounds at Connell Park. Activities include parades and fireworks, a gospel concert, 4-H activities, Miss New Brunswick talent show &amp; pageant, beautiful baby contest, horse pulling, harness racing, and a demolition derby.

The Dooryard Arts Festival is four days of music, art, theatre, stories, workshops and an open-air market.

==Economy &amp; infrastructure==

===Education===
A campus of the New Brunswick Community College, Townsview School (Grades K-8), Meduxnekeag Consolidated School (Grades K-8), and Woodstock High School.

===Transportation===
Woodstock is located on New Brunswick Route 2, an alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway. The shorter New Brunswick Route 95 extends westward from Woodstock to the Houlton/Woodstock Border Crossing, where it continues into the United States as Interstate 95.
The small public Woodstock Airport is in nearby Grafton, New Brunswick.

===Mining===
Regional geology consists of shales over a Late Ordovician to Early Silurian formation.

Iron-manganese and iron ore occurrences were reported in 1836 during a geological survey conducted by the state of Maine. The Woodstock Iron Works ran from 1848 to 1884, closing because of competition from the United States.

Today Minco owns 100% of an 880 hectare (3½ sq. mi.) manganese claim, about 6.3 km (4 miles) northwest of Woodstock. Samples were taken in 2010, 2011, and 2013. Minco plans to produce manganese well below the typical cost for the industry. The manganese would be used in the production of stainless steel.

=== Media ===
Woodstock&#x27;s radio station is CJCJ-FM. The weekly newspapers are the Bugle-Observer and the River Valley Sun.

===Architecture===
Many of the original wooden buildings have not survived into modern times. Calamities over the years included a hurricane in 1836, and fires in 1860, and 1911, As a result, much of downtown was rebuilt in the brick that remains today. Before the arrival of the railway, businesses faced the river banks, since they provided transportation, energy, and water. With the switch to rail and road traffic buildings face roads instead.

The George Frederick Clarke house, built in 1905, is a provincial historic site valued as a rare example of residential Regency architecture.

The Old Carleton County Court House was built in 1833. When new court house was constructed, the old one was used as a horse barn from 1911 to 1960 when it was purchased by the Carleton County Historical Society. It was the site of the George Gee trial, and that of Minnie Bell Sharp who ran the Woodstock School of Music in the early 1900s.

<doc id="444493" wikidata="Q235346" url="?curid=444493" title="Michelle Phillips">
<text>Holly Michelle Phillips ( Gilliam; born June 4, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as the &quot;purest soprano in pop music&quot;, she rose to fame in the mid-1960s with the folk rock vocal group the Mamas &amp; the Papas. After their disbandment, she started a successful acting career in film and television in the 1970s. 

A native of Long Beach, California, she spent her early life in Los Angeles and Mexico City, raised by her widowed father. While working as a model in San Francisco, she met and married John Phillips in 1962 and went on to co-found the Mamas &amp; the Papas in 1965. The band rose to fame with their popular singles &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Creeque Alley&quot;, both of which she co-wrote. They released five studio albums before their dissolution in 1970. While married to John Phillips, she gave birth to their daughter, singer Chynna Phillips. Michelle Phillips is the last surviving original member of the band.

After the breakup of the Mamas &amp; the Papas and her divorce from John Phillips, she transitioned into acting, appearing in a supporting part in &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971) before being cast as Billie Frechette in the critically acclaimed crime biopic &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1974, she had lead roles in two television films: the crime feature &quot;The Death Squad&quot;, and the teen drama &quot;The California Kid&quot;, in the latter of which she starred opposite Martin Sheen. She went on to appear in a number of films throughout the remainder of the 1970s, including Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977), playing Natacha Rambova, and the thriller &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979). She released her only solo album, &quot;Victim of Romance&quot;, in 1977.

Phillips&#x27;s first film of the 1980s was the comedy &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot; (1980). The next year she co-starred with Tom Skerritt in the nature-themed horror &quot;Savage Harvest&quot; (1981), followed by the television films &quot;Secrets of a Married Man&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Covenant&quot; (1985). In 1987, she joined the series &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, portraying Anne Matheson, the mother of Paige Matheson (portrayed by Nicollette Sheridan), until the series&#x27;s 1993 conclusion.

She later had supporting roles in the comedy film &quot;Let It Ride&quot; (1989) and the psychological thriller &quot;Scissors&quot; (1991). In 1998, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Mamas &amp; the Papas. Phillips appeared in independent films in the 2000s, with supporting parts in &quot;Jane White Is Sick and Twisted&quot; (2002) and &quot;Kids in America&quot; (2005) and had recurring guest roles in the television series &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; (2001–2002) and &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (2001–2004).

==Early life==
Phillips was born Holly Michelle Gilliam on June 4, 1944, in Long Beach, California, the second child of Joyce Leone (née Poole), a Canadian-born accountant, and Gardner Burnett Gilliam, a merchant mariner from San Diego. She had one older sister, Russell Ann. Phillips&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Marcus Gilliam, was from Walla Walla, Washington, and worked as a miner and hotelier in Erie, British Columbia. Gilliam County, Oregon, takes its name from her paternal ancestors. Her mother suffered heart problems stemming from a childhood bout with rheumatic fever, including subacute endocarditis, and died of a related brain hemorrhage when Phillips was five years old. Reflecting on her mother&#x27;s illness, Phillips said: &quot;They knew it was only a matter of time ... She would lie on the couch in the evenings, listening as my father read to her. One night, after my sister and I had been put to bed, my mother just raised her head, fell unconscious on the couch, and that was it.&quot;

Following his wife&#x27;s death, Phillips&#x27;s father, wanting a change of scenery, relocated the family to Buffalo, New York, where they lived for nine months while he worked as a bartender. They subsequently returned to California, settling in Pasadena. In June 1951, two days after Phillips&#x27;s seventh birthday, the family relocated again to Mexico City, where her father had enrolled to study sociology on the GI Bill at Mexico City College. Phillips spent the following six years in Mexico, where she attended public schools and became fluent in Spanish. Throughout her childhood, Spanish remained Phillips&#x27;s primary written language, though she later learned to write in English. She resided with her father and sister in the Roma Sur district of Cuauhtémoc. Phillips recalled that her and her sister&#x27;s experiences living in a different culture &quot;helped us get over my mother&#x27;s death, and instead of grieving, we became very strong, independent, and free&quot;.

At the age of 13, Phillips returned to the United States with her father and sister, settling again in Los Angeles. There, she became a childhood friend of Sue Lyon. Phillips attended several high schools in Los Angeles, including Alexander Hamilton High School and Marshall High School. While a student, Phillips played several sports and studied piano, guitar, and cello. During her sophomore year, after being caught skipping classes and subsequently forging absence permission slips, Phillips was expelled from Marshall High School and transferred to Eagle Rock High School.

In mid-1961, at age 17, Phillips relocated to San Francisco to live with her friend Tamar Hodel and began working as a model. She appeared in a billboard advertisement for Lucky Lager beer and in print ads for Cole bathing suits. Phillips quickly became immersed in San Francisco&#x27;s countercultural music scene and nightlife, recalling: &quot;Tamar and I loved going out and showing off. We had a friend, Eddie, Tamar&#x27;s hairdresser, who was a flaming homosexual and proud of it. Remember that this was early for gays to be obvious. Eddie was the first I knew and loved who was blatant. He loved to do our hair and make my face up and dress me ... We didn&#x27;t always have a lot of money, but I only once went to bed hungry.&quot; At a club in San Francisco in July 1961, she met John Phillips while he was touring California with his band the Journeymen, and the two began a whirlwind romance. He divorced his first wife and married Michelle on December 31, 1962, when she was 18 years old.

== Career ==

===1965–1969: The Mamas and the Papas===
The Phillips newlyweds relocated to New York City, where they began writing songs together and formed the Mamas and the Papas in 1965. Michelle co-wrote some of the band&#x27;s hits, including &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, which appears on the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears&quot; (1966).

Recording of the Mamas and the Papas&#x27; second album, titled &quot;The Mamas and the Papas&quot; (1966) was interrupted when Michelle Phillips&#x27;s affair with Gene Clark of the Byrds was revealed. An affair the previous year between Phillips and bandmate Denny Doherty had been forgiven; Doherty and John Phillips had reconciled and ostensibly written &quot;I Saw Her Again&quot; (1966) about the episode, although they later disagreed about how much Doherty had contributed to the song. This time, John Phillips was determined to fire his wife. After consulting their attorney and record label, John Phillips, Cass Elliot, and Denny Doherty served Michelle Phillips with a letter expelling her from the group on June 4, 1966. However, she was rehired on August 23 after the remaining band members concluded that her replacement, Jill Gibson, lacked her predecessor&#x27;s &quot;stage charisma and grittier edge&quot;. After Phillips&#x27;s reinstatement, the band embarked on a brief tour of the East Coast, playing a series of shows in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and at Fordham University in New York City.

After returning to California and settling in Los Angeles, the group recorded their third album, &quot;The Mamas &amp; The Papas Deliver&quot; (1967). In June 1967, Phillips performed with the group at the Monterey Pop Festival in Monterey, California, an event organized by John Phillips and Lou Adler. The festival also featured other prominent California-based counterculture musicians and psychedelic rock acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company (featuring Janis Joplin) and Jimi Hendrix. Recounting the experience, Phillips said: &quot;[It was like] a Renaissance Fair. It was convenient for the artists and the audience. Practically everyone had a seat, and if not, people were lining up against the fence, and they could see and hear. Or people were sitting outside, you could hear it outside, too ... It was lovely.&quot;

In August 1967, the band played what would be their final live performance at the Hollywood Bowl. Phillips would go on to record a fourth and final album with the band, &quot;The Papas &amp; The Mamas&quot; (1968), before going on a hiatus. In February 1968, she gave birth to their daughter, Chynna Phillips, who later became a vocalist with the 1990s pop trio Wilson Phillips. Michelle and John, whose marriage was failing at the time, filed for divorce in a Los Angeles County court in May 1969. The Mamas and the Papas officially disbanded in 1971 before the release of their final album, &quot;People Like Us&quot;, which was recorded to fulfill contract obligations with their record label.

===1970–1976: Transition to acting===

In 1969, while still a member of the Mamas and the Papas, Phillips acted in Gram Parsons&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Saturation 70&quot; alongside Nudie Cohn, Anita Pallenberg, and Julian Jones, the five-year-old son of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones. The film was never finished, and became a lost film. The following year, after the breakup of the Mamas and the Papas, she enrolled in acting classes in Los Angeles and has said that she had intended to start her acting career &quot;from scratch&quot;, stating that the royalties from the band&#x27;s records provided her a sustained income while she began to venture into film. She studied acting with Peggy Feury.

Phillips&#x27;s first film role came in Dennis Hopper&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971), in a minor part; she and Hopper married on October 31, 1970, shortly after the production, but the union lasted only eight days. Two years later, she was cast in a lead role in the thriller film &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973) as John Dillinger&#x27;s girlfriend, Billie Frechette. Phillips claimed she got cast by pretending to be half Cherokee, like her character. The film was critically acclaimed, and &quot;Variety&quot; said of her performance: &quot;Phillips, making her film bow after having been a member of the Mamas &amp; the Papas singing group, scores heavily as Dillinger&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;, while the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted it as &quot;mildly effective&quot;. Phillips was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer for her performance. Reflecting on the film, Phillips said: &quot;I was so lucky to have been surrounded by really great actors. Everybody in that movie was a real actor: Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Richard Dreyfuss, Harry Dean Stanton. It was just a wonderful, wonderful experience for me and I had so much support and so much help and so much encouragement. That was really my first movie. Dennis&#x27; movie [&quot;The Last Movie&quot;] was a lot of improvisation and craziness.&quot; Phillips remained a lifelong friend of co-star Stanton.
That same year, Phillips recorded vocals as a cheerleader along with Darlene Love for the Cheech &amp; Chong single &quot;Basketball Jones&quot;, which peaked at No 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart. In 1974, she was featured in the action-horror television film &quot;The California Kid&quot; opposite Martin Sheen. She had a cameo appearance in a party scene with then-boyfriend Warren Beatty in &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975). She would later state that she considered Beatty the love of her life. In 1975, Phillips signed a solo recording contract with A&amp;M Records and released a promo single, &quot;Aloha Louie&quot;, a song she wrote with ex-husband John Phillips. Phillips released her first solo single in 1976, &quot;No Love Today&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot; movie soundtrack.

===1977–1986: Solo album, film, and writing===
In 1977, Phillips released her first and only solo album, &quot;Victim of Romance&quot;, produced by Jack Nitzsche for A&amp;M Records. Commenting on the record, she said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it earlier because I never felt secure enough as a vocalist. I&#x27;m good, but Cass was always better.&quot; Phillips also commented on her involvement in its production, saying that she had been involved in &quot;every aspect, from mixing to putting together the package and cover myself&quot;. Her first two solo singles from the album failed to make the U.S. music charts. Concurrent with her solo album release, she sang backup vocals with former stepdaughter Mackenzie Phillips on &quot;Zulu Warrior&quot; for her ex-husband&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Pay Pack &amp; Follow&quot;. Around the same time, she starred as Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s second wife Natacha Rambova in Ken Russell&#x27;s film &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977). The film received mixed reviews, with &quot;Time Out&quot; London saying: &quot;Structured as a series of flashbacks from Valentino&#x27;s funeral to his early years in America, the first hour or so of this biopic is Russell&#x27;s sanest and most controlled work in several years, despite its hollow cynicism.&quot; The following year, Phillips married radio executive Robert Burch, though their marriage ended in 1979.

In 1979, she appeared in the film adaptation of the Sidney Sheldon novel &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979), a thriller starring Audrey Hepburn and Ben Gazzara. Released in June 1979, &quot;Bloodline&quot; received negative reviews from critics, and Phillips&#x27;s performance (along with those of James Mason and Maurice Ronet) was criticized by &quot;Variety&quot; as being &quot;drab&quot;. The same year, she recorded the song &quot;Forever&quot; for the movie soundtrack of &quot;California Dreaming&quot;, a surf film unrelated to her former group despite its title.

Phillips&#x27;s other film credits during this period include roles in the comedy &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot; (1980), the nature horror film &quot;Savage Harvest&quot; (1981), about a family being attacked by a pride of lions, and &quot;American Anthem&quot; (1986). On television, Phillips played the mermaid princess Nyah in three episodes of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and Leora Van Treas in &quot;Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All&quot; (1983), starring Stacy Keach in the title role. She appeared in TV miniseries such as &quot;Aspen&quot; (1977) and &quot;The French Atlantic Affair&quot; (1979).

During this time, Phillips began dating actor Grainger Hines; she gave birth to their son, Austin Deveraux Hines, on March 3, 1982. The following year, she joined the cast of &quot;Hotel&quot; as the concierge, the daughter of hotel owner Victoria Cabot&#x27;s rival, who plants his daughter as a spy to further his aim of acquiring control of the St. Gregory. Phillips continued to appear in the series until 1986. She also had a leading role in the television horror film &quot;The Covenant&quot; (1985) opposite Judy Parfitt and José Ferrer. Her relationship with Hines ended in 1984.

In 1986, Phillips wrote an autobiography, &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;: The True Story of the Mamas and the Papas&quot;, released just weeks after her former husband&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Papa John&quot;. In it, she describes events such as her first meeting with Cass Elliot, winning 17 straight shoots at a craps table in San Juan, Puerto Rico when the band was broke and could not afford the airfare back to the United States mainland, and how her writing credit on &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, which still nets her royalties, was &quot;the best wake-up call&quot; she ever had; she was asleep in a New York hotel room when husband John Phillips woke her to help him finish the new song that he was writing.

===1987–1993: &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and film===

Beginning in 1987, Phillips starred on &quot;Knots Landing&quot; as the constantly scheming Anne Matheson Sumner, the mother of star Nicollette Sheridan&#x27;s character Paige Matheson, becoming a series regular in 1989. Phillips continued to appear in the role until the series&#x27;s 1993 conclusion.

On December 2, 1987, Phillips was arrested in Amarillo, Texas, for marijuana possession after being pulled over for speeding. Phillips was a passenger in the car with boyfriend Geoffrey Tozer, and the marijuana was discovered after police searched the couple&#x27;s vehicle. Phillips was booked and released on $500 bond. Also in late 1987, Phillips sang backup vocals on Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s studio album &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot;, as well as its number-one single &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;. The following year, she appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; first-season episode &quot;We&#x27;ll Always Have Paris&quot; as Jenice Manheim, wife of the scientist Paul Manheim. Phillips and Tozer got engaged on February 29, 1988. The couple took in Aron Wilson, a friend of her son Austin&#x27;s, whom they legally adopted and raised.

While starring on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, Phillips continued to appear in films, including a supporting role in 1989&#x27;s gambling-themed &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, co-starring with Richard Dreyfuss and Teri Garr, playing what Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; characterized as a &quot;deliciously blonde society tramp&quot;. She had a supporting role in the thriller &quot;Scissors&quot; (1991), opposite Sharon Stone, playing the politician wife of a therapist treating a mentally unstable woman (Stone). Next, she had a supporting role as the wife of a former race-car driver in the action thriller &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; (1993), starring Dolph Lundgren.

Following the 1993 conclusion of &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, Phillips starred in the short-lived drama series &quot;Second Chances&quot; (1993–1994) opposite Connie Sellecca and Jennifer Lopez. She also had the lead role in the 1993 television thriller film &quot;Rubdown&quot;, playing a woman at the center of a divorce plot in which her husband pays a masseur to have an affair with her. Denise McIver of &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film, writing: &quot;The most disturbing thing about this two-hour cable telefilm is its cynicism and the fact that none of the characters seemed redeemed, or at least changed, by their experiences. This is not to say it won&#x27;t hold one&#x27;s interest, if only for the scenario, which delivers lots of bare backs, naked legs and superficially steamy sex scenes.&quot; In late September 1993, Phillips and her friend Aloma Ichinose were robbed at gunpoint outside a restaurant in West Hollywood, California.

===1994–present: Television and film===

Phillips played Laura Collins in the television drama film &quot;No One Would Tell&quot; (1996), and also supplied the voice of Raven, a television host, on Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s HBO animated series &quot;Spicy City&quot; (1997). Beginning in 1997, she portrayed Abby Malone, mother of Valerie Malone (Tiffani Thiessen) on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and in the same year reprised her role of Anne Matheson in the television film &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot;.

Having split with Tozer in 1996, Phillips began dating plastic surgeon Steven Zax in 1999. Zax was a divorced father of three sons from his marriage to Corinna Tsopei. From 1999 to 2000, Phillips had a guest role on the television series &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, on which she played Maude Standish, the mother of one of the Seven. After the millennium, Phillips continued to occasionally appear in films. She had a supporting role in the comedy &quot;Jane White Is Sick &amp; Twisted&quot; (2002), the controversial gay-themed drama &quot;Harry + Max&quot; (2004), and as a waitress in the independent comedy &quot;Unbeatable Harold&quot; (2006). Between 2001 and 2004, Phillips also appeared on television in a recurring role on The WB drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot; as Lily Jackson, sister of family matriarch Annie Jackson Camden (Catherine Hicks).

In 2009, Phillips appeared at the annual TV Land Awards for the 30th-year celebration of &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. She also appeared in a minor role in the Norwegian historical film &quot;Betrayal&quot;, which chronicles the German occupation of Norway.

In 2017, Zax, Phillips&#x27;s long-term partner of eighteen years, died. In 2019, Phillips appeared as an interview subject in Andrew Slater&#x27;s &quot;Echo in the Canyon&quot;, a documentary on the Laurel Canyon music scene of the 1960s.

==Artistry==
Phillips has been noted for her soprano vocals, and was once deemed by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;the purest soprano&quot; in pop music. A 1977 &quot;Billboard&quot; review described Phillips&#x27;s vocals as &quot;both spirited and smooth&quot;. Despite having received critical acclaim for her singing, Phillips has admitted to being self-conscious about her voice, and stated that Cass Elliot encouraged her during their tenure in the Mamas &amp; the Papas. She recalled in 2004: &quot;I&#x27;ve yet to meet another woman as strong, funny and fiercely independent as Cass was. She was very generous vocally, too. John would give us these impossibly high parts to sing because he loved the sound of girls in the clouds. Cass would tell me, &#x27;Just go for it, Mich! You know I&#x27;m gonna make it—come and join me!&#x27;&quot;

==Political views==
During a 1991 interview with Arsenio Hall, Phillips advocated providing teenagers with a pragmatic education on drugs, specifically to distinguish psychedelics and marijuana from more addictive substances such as cocaine and heroin. Though she admitted to having used LSD and marijuana in her youth, Phillips maintained that she never had experimented with other drugs, crediting the education her father instilled in her and her sister on drugs and addiction. She also spoke of her belief that parents should provide their children with condoms and other contraceptives once they are aware their children are sexually active. Phillips said that she raised her children this way: &quot;At that time, it wasn&#x27;t even a question of AIDS. It was a pregnancy issue, and venereal disease ... I raised [my children] in the same way that I was raised myself: When I was a young girl, my father said, &#x27;When you become sexually active, let me know, so that we can arrange for you not to get pregnant.&#x27; I was raised in a very pragmatic household, and I believe that if you know your children are sexually active, then you have to try to protect them.&quot;

In 2008, Phillips advocated legalization of marijuana, crediting it with helping her quit smoking cigarettes: &quot;When I really, really, really wanted a cigarette, I would take a puff of pot, and the cravings would go away.&quot;

<text>The House of Holstein-Gottorp, a cadet branch of the Oldenburg dynasty, ruled Sweden between 1751 and 1818, and Norway from 1814 to 1818. 

In 1743, Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp was elected crown prince of Sweden as a Swedish concession to Russia, a strategy for achieving an acceptable peace after the disastrous war of the same year. He became King of Sweden in 1751.

King Gustav III, Adolf Frederick&#x27;s eldest son, was enthusiastic that through his great-great-grandmother their dynasty descended from the royal House of Vasa. He expressed wishes that their house be known as Vasa, as the new royal house of Vasa and the continuation of the original. There was no effective way to force this change. Historians have not agreed with Gustav&#x27;s desires, and the house is always referred to as Holstein-Gottorp.

In 1809, Gustav III&#x27;s son King Gustav IV Adolf was deposed following the loss of Finland, and the dynasty disappeared from Swedish history with the death of his uncle King Charles XIII in 1818. In 1810, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte (later Charles XIV John), a Marshal of France, was elected crown prince, and became the founder of the next and current Swedish dynasty, the House of Bernadotte.

In 1836, Gustav, the son of the deposed Gustav IV Adolf, was created Prince of Vasa in Austria (written Wasa). However, the use of that name ceased when the prince&#x27;s only surviving child, his daughter Carola, died without children.

The marriage of the future King Gustaf V to Princess Victoria of Baden in 1881 united the ruling House of Bernadotte with a descendant of the House of Holstein-Gottorp since Victoria was a great-granddaughter of the deposed Gustav IV Adolf.

<text>Michael Manring (born June 27, 1960) is an American bass guitarist from the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Biography==
Michael Manring was born in Annapolis, Maryland, as the youngest of four children. His family lived in Norfolk, Virginia and moved to the suburbs of Washington, D.C. in 1969. The Manrings were a very active family musically, providing a very fertile background for Michael&#x27;s musical development. He and his brother Doug—a guitarist and drummer, later living a long time in Japan—formed a very active rhythm group while in high school, venturing through jazz rock and fusion, playing rock classics at beer parties or pop standards in restaurants and at weddings.

Manring was a pupil of bassist Peter Princiotto from Spring Hill area, Virginia. He began to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts in the late 1970s, but canceled his studies in 1979 because of the heavy workload he already had, touring with several different bands like the prog rock band However. During his time at Berklee College he used every opportunity to play with very different musicians and bands. In the 1980s he studied and toured with Jaco Pastorius and began to develop his own style.

In addition to a long tenure in the 1980s as house bassist for Windham Hill Records, Manring has recorded with Spastic Ink, Alex Skolnick (in the bands Skol-Patrol and Attention Deficit, also featuring Tim Alexander from Primus), Larry Kassin, Tom Darter, Steve Morse, David Cullen, Alex de Grassi, Will Ackerman and many other noted musicians. He headlined his own band, Montreux, throughout the 1980s. He has been a member of Yo Miles!, Henry Kaiser and Wadada Leo Smith&#x27;s Miles Davis tribute band, since its inception. In 1994 Manring was polled &quot;Bassist of the Year&quot; by the readers of &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine. Manring&#x27;s name is also tied with that of fingerstyle guitarist Michael Hedges, who was a dear friend and fellow musician. Manring toured extensively with Hedges and played on all Hedges albums except one. Manring is known as a humble and gracious live performer with a gift for improvisation with guest musicians.

Since 2005 Manring is member of the band DeMania with guitarist Alex de Grassi and percussionist Christopher Garcia. Manring remains active, touring the world for performances and clinics. He lives in Oakland, California. In 2020 he has collaborated with the Art of Peace global project, composed and arranged by Mehran Alirezaei.

==Music and musical influences==
Because of his association with the Windham Hill label Manring often was seen as a New Age musician. He doesn&#x27;t see himself as belonging to a certain style or genre and often jokes about categorizing his music. His album &quot;Thonk&quot; he termed for example &quot;... the first new Age–death metal–fusion–album&quot;.

Manring has a solid musical knowledge and uses the bass as a solo instrument usually in alternate tunings, with additional possibilities and patterns invoked on the fly with lever-activated de-tuners and bridges, somewhat like a pedal steel guitar. He wants to show that the electric bass can be used in a musically rich and expressive way. Manring occasionally plays on two (or even three or four) basses at the same time during live performances. Manring is also a composer of experimental music, mixing technology and fretless bass with the sounds of kitchen implements and cardboard boxes, evidenced on his &quot;Book of Flame&quot; solo album.

He is a technical virtuoso, generally using his bass in very different ways. Mostly he plays a fretless bass, which gives him ample possibilities to change tone and pitch just like on acoustic bass. Manring is rhythmically very versatile and often uses polyrhythms. He&#x27;s said to do &quot;... things on the electric bass that haven&#x27;t been done before, are nearly impossible, and (are) illegal in most states.&quot;. A unique technique employed by Manring is utilizing Hipshot D tuners to change the tuning of one or more strings over the course of playing a piece.

==Equipment==
Manring plays a custom bass by Zon Guitars, called the Hyperbass, a very flexible instrument, which was developed by Joseph Zon and Manring. Special tuning pegs and a special bridge allow instantaneous tuning change of single strings as well as of all strings simultaneously by the action of several tiny levers, a system like that of the TransTrem guitar. The development of this special model was caused by Manring&#x27;s use of open tunings. When Manring began changing tunings during pieces by turning the pegs while playing, he soon realized the limitations of this approach. First he tried to overcome these limitations by changing a normal Music Man Sting Ray Bass, but then began to develop the Hyperbass with Zon. The Hyperbass has Bartolini pickups for every string and four Fishman transducers for the body signals of the instruments.

Apart from the Hyperbass, Manring uses a whole fleet of instruments. A listing at his website gives the following models:

* Zon Legacy Elite Special fretless, aka &quot;Bub&quot;
* Homemade Jazz Bass–style fretless
* Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass
* Zon Custom Fretless, aka &quot;Junior&quot; or &quot;Son of Bub&quot;
* Larrivee 5-string fretless acoustic bass guitar
* MusicMan Stingray fretless
* Paroutaud Music Laboratories 5-string fretless &quot;Infinite Sustain&quot; prototype
* PRS fretless
* Riverhead Unicorn fretless
* Riverhead Unicorn fretted bass
* Zon prototype headless fretted bass, aka &quot;Vinny&quot;
* Zon Legacy Elite 6-string fretless
* Zon prototype Legacy 10-string bass (5 x 2).

Manring uses Markbass amplifiers and EBow/PlusBow.

<doc id="444498" wikidata="Q572427" url="?curid=444498" title="Weingarten, Württemberg">
<text>Weingarten (; ; ) is a town with a population of 25,000 () in Württemberg, in the District of Ravensburg, in the valley of the Schussen River. Together with the southern neighbour cities of Ravensburg and Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance (Bodensee), it forms one of 14 medium-sized infrastructural centres in Baden-Württemberg. The town is seat of the University of Applied Sciences of Ravensburg-Weingarten (&quot;Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten&quot;) and of the Teachers&#x27; College of Weingarten (&quot;Pädagogische Hochschule Weingarten&quot;).

==History==

The town was formerly known as Altdorf and was renamed to Weingarten in 1865. Before that, Weingarten was the name of Weingarten Abbey only, which lay on the Martinsberg (St. Martin&#x27;s hill) above the town. The name &quot;Altdorf&quot; is derived from the Frankish &quot;alach&quot; for &quot;church&quot;. So &quot;Altdorf&quot; does not mean &quot;old village&quot; but &quot;village/thorp with the parish church&quot;.

Near the old town, an Alemannic burial place was excavated in 1954–1957, dating from the 5th century. In the 8th century the region became part of the Frankish empire. Around the 9th century the Elder Welfs became counts of the Schussengau and established their seat in Altdorf.

In 1056 Welf IV transferred the ancestral seat of the Welfs to the newly built castle of Ravensburg. He founded a new Benedictine abbey at the Martinsberg in Altdorf; this abbey was named Weingarten Abbey.

By a contract of inheritance, in 1191 the Hohenstaufen Frederick Barbarossa acquired the ownership of the Schussengau (including Altdorf, Weingarten and Ravensburg) from Welf VI, Duke of Spoleto and uncle of both Frederick Barbarossa and Henry the Lion.

About seventy years later, with the death of Conradin in Naples in 1268, the line of the Hohenstaufen became extinct. Their former estates were confiscated as imperial property of the Holy Roman Empire. While the small town of Altdorf was ruled by the &quot;Reichslandvogt&quot; (imperial steward resp. bailiff) of Swabia, the abbey of Weingarten won the status of an &quot;Imperial Abbey&quot; with privileges similar to those of an Imperial Free City. The &quot;Landvogtei&quot; was given in 1473/1486 as pawn to Sigismund, Archduke of Austria, which led to its integration as a district within Further Austria.

The &quot;Vogt&quot;&#x27;s seat was first located at the castle of Ravensburg (most often called &quot;Veitsburg&quot; to distinguish it from the Imperial City of Ravensburg) until 1647 when Swedish troops destroyed the castle and the &quot;Vogt&quot; moved to a palace (the today&#x27;s &quot;Schlössle&quot;) in Altdorf.

The abbey of Weingarten became one of the wealthiest monasteries in southern Germany, owning about 306 km2 of rich estates, before it was confiscated during the secularization following the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluß&quot; bill in 1803. Weingarten was first allotted to the House of Nassau, Altdorf to the dukedom of Württemberg. In 1806 Weingarten, too, was incorporated into Württemberg.

During the 19th century several barracks were placed in Altdorf-Weingarten, making the city an important military site; following this in 1911 a young Erwin Rommel was based in the town. 
As in neighbouring Ravensburg, a significant engineering industry evolved during the second half of the century, based mainly on the local traditions of (paper and other) mills and textile production.

In 1922, monks from Beuron Abbey (on the Danube) and Erdington Abbey (in Birmingham) founded a new Benedictine abbey that leased some of the former abbey rooms. In 2010 the last four monks abandoned the abbey, the lease was taken over by the Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart which tried to find a new monastic community to install here.

During Nazi Germany Weingarten was incorporated into Ravensburg; after the war, the rival cities were separated again.

Since 1949, most of the former abbey buildings have been occupied by a teachers&#x27; college. A smaller part of the main building is leased to the Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart which runs the Catholic Academy for adult education there. New buildings were erected in the neighbourhood by the University of Applied Sciences Ravensburg-Weingarten. In 2014 parts of the Academy were rededicated as a refugees home, in 2015 rooms of the then-abandoned abbey were rededicated as auxiliary first admittance facility for refugees.

During the municipal reforms of the 1970s, a renewed attempt to fuse Ravensburg and Weingarten failed due to massive resistance on the part of Weingarten&#x27;s citizenry.

Weingarten was home to the NATO International Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol School through the 1980s and 90s until it moved to Pfullendorf.

==Places of interest==
*The Abbey Church of St. Martin and Oswald, also known as &quot;Münster&quot; or &quot;Basilika&quot;, is the largest Baroque church north of the Alps. It is approximately half as long as St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome and hence sometimes referred to as &quot;Swabian St. Peter&quot;. The church features a baroque organ by Joseph Gabler with 4 manuals and nearly 7,000 pipes, including a 49 rank pedal mixture &quot;La Force&quot; on the bottom pedal C.
*The surrounding convent and other abbey buildings are also built in Baroque style.
*The Alemans Museum displays archaeological finds from an Alemannic burial place of the early Middle Ages. It is one of the largest museums specializing in the history of the Alemans.
*The &quot;Schlössle&quot; (&quot;small palace&quot;) was erected around 1550 as the administrative seat of the Imperial steward (&quot;Reichslandvogt&quot;) of Swabia. In the 18th century it was used as residence of the imperial judge, in the 19th and 20th century as a domicile of higher-ranking military officers. Since 2001 it is home to the municipal museum.

==Events==
===Fasnet===
The local tradition of the Swabian-Alemannic carnival called Fasnet can be traced back to 1348. At that time &quot;town-hall dances&quot; were reported, celebrating the end of a pest epidemic.

Every year, the Fasnet season starts with the &quot;Gumpige Dunnschdig&quot; (Jumpy Thursday) a week before Ash Wednesday. In the evening, the &quot;Hemedglonkerumzug&quot; (from &quot;hemed&quot; = &quot;nightgown&quot; in local dialect) takes place, so everybody runs through the streets in pyjamas or nightshirts. This custom symbolizes the awakening of carnival fools.

The main pageant takes place at Sunday. Typical carnival characters of Weingarten are the &quot;Plätzler&quot; (in a red and white costume, first depicted in 1868), the &quot;Lauratal ghosts&quot; and the &quot;Bockstallnarren&quot; (&quot;buck stable fools&quot;). In addition to these local groups, many other carnival groups from the region take part in the pageant.

===&quot;Blutritt&quot; procession===

On the Friday following Ascension, Catholics from Weingarten and from most parts of Upper Swabia take part in the annual Blutritt, a large equestrian procession. The procession of about 3,000 riders and dozens of local music bands leads through the town centre and some surrounding villages to bless houses, farms and fields with a relic of the holy blood of Jesus Christ. During the rest of the year, the relic is on display in the Weingarten Abbey church.

<text>Pfaffenhofen () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Eichstätt, Kelheim, Freising, Dachau and Neuburg-Schrobenhausen, and the city of Ingolstadt.

==History==
In early medieval times the region was partially property of the powerful monasteries of Ilmmünster and Münchsmünster, and partially divided into tiny secular states. One of those states was the county of Scheyern. The counts were ancestors of the Wittelsbach family, who in 1180 became rulers of Bavaria. From that time on the region was a part of Bavaria.

The district of Pfaffenhofen was established in 1972 by merging several former districts.

==Geography==
The district is located in the Hallertau Plains between the Isar and Danube rivers. The Danube crosses the northernmost part of the district.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the white and blue lozenges of Bavaria
* a cross symbolising the monastery of Scheyern
* a branch of hops

<text>Holstein-Gottorp () is the historiographical name, as well as contemporary shorthand name, for the parts of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, also known as Ducal Holstein, that were ruled by the dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, a side branch of the elder Danish line of the German House of Oldenburg. Other parts of the duchies were ruled by the kings of Denmark.

The territories of Gottorp are located in present-day Denmark and Germany. The main seat of the dukes was Gottorf Castle in the city of Schleswig in the duchy of Schleswig. It is also the name of the ducal house, which ascended to several thrones. For this reason, genealogists and historians sometimes use the name of Holstein-Gottorp for related dynasties of other countries.

The formal title adopted by these rulers was &quot;Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Dithmarschen and Stormarn&quot;, but that title was also used by his kinsmen, the kings of Denmark and their cadet branches, as it was the common property of all these agnates. The Gottorp branch held &quot;Landeshoheit&quot; (territorial superiority) over the duchy of Holstein in the Holy Roman Empire and over the duchy of Schleswig in the kingdom of Denmark. For the sake of convenience, the name Holstein-Gottorp is used instead of the technically more correct &quot;Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in/at Gottorp&quot;.

The oldest of the ducal titles was that of Schleswig, which had been confirmed in fief to a royal kinsman by the regent Queen Margaret I of Denmark, Sweden and Norway in 1386 on behalf of her son, Olaf II of Denmark. The kings of Denmark were granted Holstein as an imperial fief by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III in 1474.

== History ==

In 1544, the so-called &quot;one-third duchy&quot; was ceded to Adolf, third son of King Frederick I of Denmark and the youngest half-brother of King Christian III of Denmark. Thus, the surviving House of Holstein-Gottorp is a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg. The Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp shared the uneasy rule of Schleswig and Holstein with the Kings of Denmark. As such, they were often allies (practically clients) of the Swedes, enemies of the Danes. This longtime alliance was sealed by several dynastic marriages: Christina of Holstein-Gottorp married Charles IX of Sweden, Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp married Charles X Gustavus, Duke Frederick IV married the eldest daughter of King Charles XI of Sweden, and ultimately Prince Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp ascended to the Swedish throne in 1751, founding the Holstein-Gottorp dynasty of Sweden (ruled 1751–1818).

By the Treaty of Roskilde (1658) and the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660), Denmark-Norway released Gottorp from its feudal bonds and recognized the sovereignty of its dukes over the Gottorp portions of the duchy of Schleswig. In fact, these Schleswigers had been relatively independent already for more than a century. Although the duchy of Holstein remained officially a fief of the Empire, in fact by treaty its dukes co-governed both duchies with their formal overlord, the Danish king.

=== Gottorp question ===
In the Great Northern War, the duchy sided with Sweden and was defeated after Danish troops occupied the northern portions of Holstein-Gottorp. According to the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg, Swedish support for Gottorp ceased, making it impossible for the dukes to regain their lost territories in Schleswig and prolonging their feud with the king of Denmark. Following the peace settlement of 1721, Duke Charles Frederick fled to the court of Peter the Great of Russia, and for some time, the Russians plotted to restore Charles Frederick to his lands in Schleswig. Charles Frederick himself was married to Grand Duchess Anna, Peter&#x27;s daughter. Peter II and his successors abandoned the policy of Peter the Great of backing the claims of the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp on their part of Schleswig. in fact Russia wanted to have a port on the coast of the Northern sea so it needed not Schleswig but the friendship of dukes. But from this marriage was born Charles Peter Ulrich, who succeeded to Holstein-Gottorp in 1739, and became an heir to the Russian throne according to the will of Catherine I and especially upon the accession of his childless aunt Elizabeth in 1741.

Charles Peter Ulrich, who acceded to the Russian throne as Peter III in 1762, was determined to conquer his part of Schleswig from Denmark–Norway and to attach it to Holstein. When he became emperor in 1762, he immediately signed a generous peace with Prussia and withdrew Russia from the Seven Years&#x27; War in order to concentrate fully on an attack upon Denmark together with Prussia. This move angered Russian opinion, since it was considered a betrayal of Russia&#x27;s sacrifices in the war, as well as placing national interests in jeopardy. At the same time, the Danish army had hastily moved across the border into Mecklenburg, to avoid an invasion of Holstein, and prepared for battle. The two armies stood less than 30 kilometres apart when news from Saint Petersburg suddenly reached the Russian army that its emperor had been overthrown by his wife, who had now acceded to the throne as Empress Catherine II. One of her first actions was to call off the war against Denmark and any territorial claims and restore normal relations.

Peter III&#x27;s son, Paul, the new Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, was a minor under the regency of his mother, the empress. With the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo, she agreed to cede the territorial claims of her son to the Holstein-Gottorp lands still held by Denmark and to cede the part of Duchy, held by her husband, obtaining in exchange the German countships of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, elevated in 1776 into the duchy of Oldenburg within the Holy Roman Empire. The duchy was given to the cousin of Paul&#x27;s grandfatherthe aged Prince-Bishop of Lübeck, head of a younger branch of the Holstein-Gottorp family. This put an end to the &quot;Gottorp question&quot;, which had generated so many conflicts between the Nordic powers.

The House of Holstein-Gottorp acceded to several European thrones. The dynastic policy of the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp resulted in its cadet branch, the Swedish line, ruling Sweden from 1751 until 1818 and Norway from 1814 to 1818. In 1863, the related House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg — descended from King Christian III of Denmark — became Kings of Denmark and Greece and, in 1905, of Norway.

The Lübeck branch became first dukes and later grand dukes of Oldenburg from (1773 until 1918), while the senior branch ruled Russia briefly in 1762 and then again from 1796 until 1917 (while in 1762–1796 it was ruled by their widow, second cousin and mother). However although agnatic members of this house reigned in Russia, they were commonly called Romanov, or more rarely, Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov.

==Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp==

Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein at Gottorp:
* 1544–1586: Adolf
* 1586–1587: Frederick II
* 1587–1590: Philip
* 1590–1616: John Adolf
* 1616–1659: Frederick III
* 1659–1694: Christian Albert
* 1694–1702: Frederick IV
* 1702–1720: Charles Frederick

Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp at Kiel:
* 1720–1739: Charles Frederick
* 1739–1762: Karl Peter Ulrich (later Peter III of Russia)
* 1762–1773: Paul (Emperor 1796–1801) 1773 exchanged claim for Duchy of Oldenburg

Titular Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp at St Petersburg (House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov):
* 1773–1801: Paul (Emperor 1796–1801) 
* 1801–1825: Alexander I of Russia
* 1825–1831: Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia
* 1831–1856: Nicholas I of Russia
* 1856–1881: Alexander II of Russia
* 1881–1894: Alexander III of Russia
* 1894–1918: Nicholas II of Russia
* 1918–1918: 
* 1918–1938: Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia (After the murder of the Emperor and the Tsarevitch in 1918, the title passed to the surviving senior male branch of the Romanov family)
* 1938–1992: Vladimir Kirillovich, Grand Duke of Russia (Grand Duke Vladimir died with only female issue, and so the title should pass to the senior male member of the House of Romanov-Holstein-Gottorp. To whom is a contested issue)

One view is that the heir is the non-dynastic son of Grand Duke Dimitri, only son of Grand Duke Paul, himself the youngest brother of Alexander III. This heir is non-dynastic in the Russian sense, but the Danish branch of the House of Oldenburg had no declared ban against unequal marriages (but against non authorized marriages in Denmark), as Schleswig, where the (once sovereign) Schloss Gottorf is located, was never part of Holy Roman Empire or under its jurisdiction. These heirs live in USA and have not staked a public claim to titles.

* 1992–2004: Prince Paul Dimitrievich Romanovsky-Ilyinsky
* 2004–present: Prince Dimitri Pavlovich Romanovsky-Ilyinsky (born 1954)

Prince Dimitri Pavlovich Romanovsky-Ilyinsky has no sons. His only male heir, his brother Prince Michael Romanovsky-Ilyinsky, is also without male issue, and there are currently no further male heirs in the Romanovsky-Ilyinsky line to inherit this theoretical claim to the Duchy. This claim would then pass on through the line of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia to Andrew Andreevich, Prince of Russia and his descendants.

Another view determines that Nicholas II&#x27;s August 11, 1903 renunciation of claims to the Oldenburg titles and duchy for himself and for all his family and descendants made it impossible for any of the Romanov heirs to bear the dynastically valid Schleswig Holstein titles independently.

A third view is that by the end of the Holy Roman Empire it was a principle of German princely law that members of all princely families which held &quot;Reichsstand&quot; status therein were required to contract &quot;ebenbürtig&quot; in order to transmit dynastic rights to their descendants. If descendants of Grand Duke Dmitri&#x27;s marriage with Audrey Emery are considered ineligible to succeed to the ducal Holstein claim, it is unclear which, if any, of the various male-line branches descended from the Imperial Romanovs remain eligible. If marriages-in-exile with Russian princesses or countesses meet the marital standard, male-line heirs may yet exist. If, however, all marriages deemed morganatic by Russian Imperial standards were also non-dynastic for the Gottorp succession, the genealogically senior Holstein-Gottorp dynast would be Christian, Duke of Oldenburg, current head of the branch descending from Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin, the younger brother of Duke Frederick IV. He already holds claim to the defunct title of grand duke of Oldenburg. Either way, the king of Denmark exercised sovereignty in the duchies and provided financial support to the cadet Schleswig-Holstein branches of the House of Oldenburg. The claim to Holstein inherited by Emperor Paul I from Peter III was exchanged in 1773 for the Danish kings&#x27; duchy of Oldenburg (residual succession rights being retained), the rulers of which lost sovereignty there in 1918. King Christian IX of Denmark lost Schleswig and Holstein in the Second Schleswig War in 1864, subsequent to which both duchies were incorporated into the kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire. Danish monarchs continued to use their traditional ducal titles in pretence until the death of king Frederik IX of Denmark in 1972. In 1920, Northern Schleswig was returned to Danish rule after a plebiscite, the remainder of the former duchies remains part of Germany.

<text>Hedera, commonly called ivy (plural ivies), is a genus of 12–15 species of evergreen climbing or ground-creeping woody plants in the family Araliaceae, native to Western Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, Macaronesia, northwestern Africa and across central-southern Asia east to Japan and Taiwan. Several species are cultivated as climbing ornamentals, and the name &quot;ivy&quot; especially denotes common ivy (&quot;Hedera helix&quot;), known in North America as &quot;English ivy&quot;, which is frequently planted to clothe brick walls.

==Description==
On level ground ivies remain creeping, not exceeding 5–20 cm height, but on surfaces suitable for climbing, including trees, natural rock outcrops or man-made structures such as quarry rock faces or built masonry and wooden structures, they can climb to at least 30 m above the ground. Ivies have two leaf types, with palmately lobed juvenile leaves on creeping and climbing stems and unlobed cordate adult leaves on fertile flowering stems exposed to full sun, usually high in the crowns of trees or the tops of rock faces, from 2 m or more above ground. The juvenile and adult shoots also differ, the former being slender, flexible and scrambling or climbing with small aerial roots to affix the shoot to the substrate (rock or tree bark), the latter thicker, self-supporting and without roots. The flowers are greenish-yellow with five small petals; they are produced in umbels in autumn to early winter and are very rich in nectar. The fruit is a greenish-black, dark purple or (rarely) yellow berry 5–10 mm diameter with one to five seeds, ripening in late winter to mid-spring. The seeds are dispersed by birds which eat the berries.

The species differ in detail of the leaf shape and size (particularly of the juvenile leaves) and in the structure of the leaf trichomes, and also in the size and, to a lesser extent, the colour of the flowers and fruit. The chromosome number also differs between species. The basic diploid number is 48, while some are tetraploid with 96, and others hexaploid with 144 and octaploid with 192 chromosomes.

==Ecology==
Ivies are natives of Eurasia and North Africa, but have been introduced to North America and Australia. They invade disturbed forest areas in North America. Ivy seeds are spread by birds.

Ivies are of major ecological importance for their nectar and fruit production, both produced at times of the year when few other nectar or fruit sources are available. The ivy bee &quot;Colletes hederae&quot; is completely dependent on ivy flowers, timing its entire life cycle around ivy flowering. The fruit are eaten by a range of birds, including thrushes, blackcaps, and woodpigeons. The leaves are eaten by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as angle shades, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, scalloped hazel, small angle shades, small dusty wave (which feeds exclusively on ivy), swallow-tailed moth and willow beauty.

A very wide range of invertebrates shelter and overwinter in the dense woody tangle of ivy. Birds and small mammals also nest in ivy. It serves to increase the surface area and complexity of woodland environments.

==Taxonomy==

The following species are widely accepted; they are divided into two main groups, depending on whether they have scale-like or stellate trichomes on the undersides of the leaves:
*Trichomes scale-like
**&quot;Hedera algeriensis&quot; Hibberd – Algerian ivy. Algeria, Tunisia (Mediterranean coast).
**&quot;Hedera canariensis&quot; Willd. – Canaries ivy. Canary Islands.
**&quot;Hedera colchica&quot; (K.Koch) K.Koch – Persian ivy. Alborz, Caucasus, Turkey.
**&quot;Hedera cypria&quot; McAllister – Cyprus ivy (syn. &quot;H. pastuchovii&quot; subsp. &quot;cypria&quot; (McAll.) Hand). Cyprus (Troodos Mts.)
**&quot;Hedera iberica&quot; (McAllister) Ackerfield &amp; J.Wen – Iberian ivy. SW Iberian coasts.
**&quot;Hedera maderensis&quot; – Madeiran ivy. Madeira.
**&quot;Hedera maroccana&quot; McAllister – Moroccan ivy. Morocco.
**&quot;Hedera nepalensis&quot; K.Koch – Himalayan ivy (syn. &quot;H. sinensis&quot; (Tobl.) Hand.-Mazz.). Himalaya, SW China.
**&quot;Hedera pastuchovii&quot; G.Woronow – Pastuchov&#x27;s ivy. Caucasus, Alborz.
**&quot;Hedera rhombea&quot; (Miq.) Siebold ex Bean – Japanese ivy. Japan, Korea, Taiwan.
*Trichomes stellate
**&quot;Hedera azorica&quot; Carrière – Azores ivy. Azores.
**&quot;Hedera crebrescens&quot; M. Bényei-Himmer et M. Höhn - Buda ivy. Central Europe
**&quot;Hedera helix&quot; L. – Common ivy (syn. &quot;H. caucasigena&quot; Pojark., &quot;H. taurica&quot; (Hibberd) Carrière). Europe, and widely introduced elsewhere.
**&quot;Hedera hibernica&quot; (G.Kirchn.) Bean – Atlantic ivy (syn. &quot;H. helix&quot; subsp. &quot;hibernica&quot; (G.Kirchn.) D.C.McClint.). Atlantic western Europe.

The species of ivy are largely allopatric and closely related, and many have on occasion been treated as varieties or subspecies of &quot;H. helix&quot;, the first species described. Several additional species have been described in the southern parts of the former Soviet Union, but are not regarded as distinct by most botanists.

Hybrids have been recorded between several &quot;Hedera&quot; species, including Atlantic ivy (&quot;H hibernica&quot;) with common ivy (&quot;H helix&quot;). Hybridisation may also have played a part in the evolution of some species in the genus. A well-known hybrid involving ivies is the intergeneric hybrid &quot;× Fatshedera lizei&quot;, a cross between &quot;Fatsia japonica&quot; and &quot;Hedera hibernica&quot;. This hybrid was produced once in a garden in France in 1910 and has never successfully been repeated, the hybrid being maintained in cultivation by vegetative propagation.

==Uses and cultivation==

Ivies are very popular in cultivation within their native range and compatible climates elsewhere, for their evergreen foliage, attracting wildlife, and for adaptable design uses in narrow planting spaces and on tall or wide walls for aesthetic addition, or to hide unsightly walls, fences and tree stumps. Numerous cultivars with variegated foliage and/or unusual leaf shapes have been selected for horticultural use. 

The American Ivy Society is the International Cultivar Registration Authority for &quot;Hedera&quot;, and recognises over 400 registered cultivars.

==Problems and dangers==

===On trees===

Much discussion has involved whether or not ivy climbing trees will harm trees. In Europe, the harm is generally minor although there can be competition for soil nutrients, light, and water, and senescent trees supporting heavy ivy growth can be liable to windthrow damage. The UK&#x27;s Woodland Trust says &quot;Ivy has long been accused of strangling trees, but it doesn’t harm the tree at all, and even supports at least 50 species of wildlife.&quot; Harm and problems are more significant in North America, where ivy is without the natural pests and diseases that control its vigour in its native continents; the photosynthesis or structural strength of a tree can be overwhelmed by aggressive ivy growth leading to death directly or by opportunistic disease and insect attacks.
===Invasive exotic===

Several ivy species have become a serious invasive species (invasive exotic) in natural native plant habitats, especially riparian and woodland types, and also a horticultural weed in gardens of the western and southern regions of North America with milder winters. Ivies create a dense, vigorously smothering, shade-tolerant evergreen groundcover that can spread through assertive underground rhizomes and above-ground runners quickly over large natural plant community areas and outcompete the native vegetation. The use of ivies as ornamental plants in horticulture in California and other states is now discouraged or banned in certain jurisdictions. Drought-tolerant &quot;H. canariensis&quot; and &quot;H. algeriensis&quot; and European &quot;H. helix&quot; were originally cultivated in garden, park, and highway landscaping, but they have become aggressively invasive in coastal forests and riparian ecosystems, now necessitating costly eradication programs. Similar problems exist in Australia. Only one species of ivy, &quot;H. helix&quot; , bears the status of &#x27;declared weed&#x27; in Australia; in the Australian Capital Territory, and Western Australia only. 

===Toxicity===
The berries are moderately toxic to humans. Ivy foliage contains triterpenoid saponins and falcarinol.
Falcarinol is capable of inducing contact dermatitis. It has also been shown to kill breast cancer cells.

===Stinging insects===
The flowers of ivy are pollinated by Hymenoptera and are particularly attractive to the common wasp.

==Etymology and other names==
The name ivy derives from Old English &quot;ifig&quot;, cognate with German &quot;Efeu&quot;, of unknown original meaning. The scientific name &quot;Hedera&quot; is the classical Latin name for the plant. Old regional common names in Britain, no longer used, include &quot;Bindwood&quot; and &quot;Lovestone&quot;, for the way it clings and grows over stones and bricks. US Pacific Coast regional common names for &quot;H. canariensis&quot; include &quot;California ivy&quot; and &quot;Algerian ivy&quot;. For &quot;H. helix&quot;, regional common names include &quot;common ivy&quot; (Britain and Ireland) and &quot;English ivy&quot; (North America).

The name ivy has also been used as a common name for a number of other unrelated plants, including Boston ivy (Japanese creeper &quot;Parthenocissus tricuspidata&quot;, in the family Vitaceae), Cape-ivy (used interchangeably for &quot;Senecio angulatus&quot; and &quot;Delairea odorata&quot;, Asteraceae), poison-ivy (&quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot;, Anacardiaceae), Swedish ivy (whorled plectranthus &quot;Plectranthus verticillatus&quot;, Lamiaceae) and ground ivy (&quot;Glechoma hederacea&quot;, also Lamiaceae), and Kenilworth ivy (&quot;Cymbalaria muralis&quot;, Plantaginaceae).

==Cultural symbolism==
Like many other evergreen plants, which impressed European cultures by persisting through the winter, ivy has traditionally been imbued with a spiritual significance. It was brought into homes to drive out evil spirits.

In Ancient Rome it was believed that a wreath of ivy could prevent a person from becoming drunk, and such a wreath was worn by Bacchus, the god of intoxication.

Ivy bushes or ivy-wrapped poles have traditionally been used to advertise taverns in the United Kingdom, and many pubs are still called The Ivy.

The clinging nature of ivy makes it a symbol of love and friendship, there was once a tradition of priests giving ivy to newlyweds, and as it clings to dead trees and remains green, it was also viewed as a symbol of the eternal life of the soul after the death of the body in medieval Christian symbolism.

The traditional British Christmas carol, &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot;, uses ivy as a symbol for the Virgin Mary.

Ivy-covered ruins were a staple of the Romantic movement in landscape painting, for example &quot;Visitor to a Moonlit Churchyard&quot; by Philip James de Loutherbourg (1790), &quot;Tintern Abbey, West Front&quot; by Joseph Mallord William Turner (1794) and &quot;Netley Abbey&quot; by Francis Towne (1809). In this context ivy may represent the ephemerality of human endeavours and the sublime power of nature. 

The image of ivy-covered historic buildings gave the name Ivy League to a group of old and prestigious American universities.

Ivy features extensively in the 2010 movie &quot;Arrietty&quot; and the poster for the film.

<text>Name That Tune is an American television music game show. Originally created and produced by orchestra conductor Harry Salter and his wife Roberta Semple Salter, the series features contestants competing to correctly identify songs being played by an on-stage orchestra or band.

&quot;Name That Tune&quot; premiered on the NBC Radio Network in 1952, where it aired until 1954, and made the move to television in 1953 on the same network. CBS picked up the television series in the summer of 1953 and carried it through 1959.

A revival in 1974 was much more successful. Airing weekly, the 1974 syndicated offering used a new show format and, beginning in 1976, offered a top prize of $100,000 to a lucky champion (after which the show became known as &quot;The $100,000 Name That Tune&quot;). Tom Kennedy hosted this series, which ran until 1981 and began airing twice weekly during its final season.

During the course of Kennedy&#x27;s series, two attempts were made at reviving the series for network television, both on its original home at NBC. Dennis James hosted the first of these series, which ran daily for five months in daytime in 1974 and came to an end shortly after the new year in 1975. In 1977, a second daily daytime series with Kennedy hosting was conceived, but this too was short-lived and was cancelled after six months.

&quot;Name That Tune&quot; returned in 1984 to syndication, again using the $100,000 prize in its branding. Hosted by Jim Lange, this revival was the first syndicated edition of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; not to air on a weekly basis from the start; instead, the show aired as a daily series with some changes to the format, including the tournament structure. It did not find the success that its predecessor had in syndication and came to an end after one season in 1985.

In November 2020, Prestige Entertainment, Eureka Productions, and Fox announced a new primetime version of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; hosted by actress Jane Krakowski (with Randy Jackson of &quot;American Idol&quot; fame as bandleader), which premiered on January 6, 2021. The twelve-episode first season was filmed in Australia with American contestants. A second season of the revival premiered on March 29, 2022, which was filmed in Ireland; in this season, four of the eight episodes featured celebrity contestants. A third season of the revival, titled &quot;Celebrity Name That Tune&quot;, premiered on January 11, 2023, and a fourth season consisting of episodes featuring celebrities and members of the general public began on January 23, 2024.

== Background and production ==

=== Development ===
&quot;Name That Tune&quot; had its conceptual origins in an earlier radio and television series, &quot;Stop the Music&quot;. &quot;Stop the Music&quot; was created by Mark Goodson, orchestra conductor Harry Salter, and advertising executive Howard Connell. &quot;Stop the Music&quot; relied on studio audience members and random telephone calls to potential viewers/listeners to identify melodies played by an orchestra. &quot;Name That Tune&quot; changed this idea to a head-to-head competition between two onstage contestants.

Incarnations of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; over the years have maintained core concepts. These include an orchestra and/or a band, head-to-head contestant identification of songs played by that orchestra/band, and a bonus round known as the &quot;Golden Medley&quot;, where the winner of the head-to-head competition plays on their own for the episode&#x27;s grand prize. Previous winners would sometimes be invited back to identify songs for much larger prizes – in the 1950s television version the prize was $25,000, and by the 1970s–1980s, this grand prize was increased to $100,000.

==== Orchestra, band, dancers ====
Bob Alberti was the conductor of the orchestra for the first season of the 1970s run, with Tommy Oliver replacing him in 1975 and Stan Worth replacing Oliver in 1978. The orchestra also featured a vocalist at times. Originally the position was held by Kathie Lee Gifford, then known as Kathie Lee Johnson, who performed from 1977 to 1978. She was replaced by Monica Burruss for the 1978–79 season, who remained with the series until its 1981 cancellation.

Also for the 1978–79 season, the series brought in choreographers Dennon Rawles and Jerri Fiala, the latter of whom was already working for show producer Ralph Edwards as hostess on &quot;The Cross-Wits&quot;, to serve as background dancers; and the Name That Tune Orchestra (with Burruss) was supplemented by The Sound System, a rock music ensemble led by Dan Sawyer with Steve March as its featured vocalist. The dancers only appeared for one season, but The Sound System and March stayed on for the rest of the show&#x27;s run.

In the 1984–85 series, Tommy Oliver returned to lead the orchestra.

The 2021 version sees musician, record executive and former &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Randy Jackson as bandleader. Jackson also performs announcing duties at the beginning of the show.

== Gameplay ==

=== 1950s version ===
In the 1950s version of &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, the contestants stood across the stage from two large ship&#x27;s bells as the orchestra started playing tunes. When a contestant knew the tune, they ran across the stage to &quot;ring the bell and name that tune&quot; Four tunes were played every game, and each tune was worth increasing dollar amounts. The first tune was worth $5 and each subsequent tune was worth double the previous tune, up to $40 for the fourth and final tune. The player with the most money after four tunes won the game and played the &quot;Golden Medley&quot; bonus round. From 1955 to 1959, only three tunes were played, worth $10, $20 and $30. If both players were tied at $30 each, both played as a team in the Golden Medley.

==== Golden Medley ====
In the original series, all the tunes played were selected by home viewers. Each correct tune won money for the winning contestant as well as the home viewers. The first correct answer was worth $25, and each subsequent correct answer doubled the money. Naming all seven won $1,600 and gave a home viewer a chance to come to the New York studio where the show was taped at that time, and play along with the studio contestant in a special round called the &quot;Golden Medley Marathon&quot;.

=====The Golden Medley Marathon=====
In the Golden Medley Marathon, the winning home viewer and the winning studio contestant worked as a team. This time, the two players had to correctly guess five tunes in 30 seconds, and if they did so they split $10,000 and returned the next week to try and do it again. They could keep coming back for up to four additional weeks, and potentially could win a combined $50,000.

The top prize for the prime time CBS show, by 1959, was $25,000.

=== 1974–81 version ===
Two contestants selected from the studio audience compete in various song identification games to earn points as well as cash and prizes. Three rounds were played per game, typically beginning with Melody Roulette, followed by a second game which varied by-episode, and culminating with Bid-a-Note. Each of the first two games awarded 10 points to the winner, but Bid-a-Note was worth 20 points. A round&#x27;s points were split between the players in the event of a tie. If the players were tied after the final competitive round, a single tiebreaker tune was played to determine who advanced to the Golden Medley bonus round for a chance at more prizes.

==== Melody Roulette ====
A wheel was spun onstage to determine a cash prize for identifying the tune. Early in both the daytime and syndicated versions the wheel contained categories. Each contestant selected a category before each spin and received $100 if the wheel stopped on their choice. However, the categories were later replaced by money amounts ranging from $20 to $1,000 from 1974 to 1976, $50–$1,000 from 1976 to 1977, and $100–$1,000 from 1977 to 1981 on the syndicated series (and $50–$500 on the 1977 daytime series). Also, after the switch to dollar amounts on the wheel, each contestant selected a space on the wheel (a $100 space in daytime, a $200 space in the syndicated series). If the wheel landed on one of those spaces, that contestant won that amount automatically prior to the start of the tune; this was discarded in 1976.

An outer wheel was added in 1976 which held two spaces marked &quot;Double&quot; and was spun in the opposite direction of the inner. From 1977 to 1980, it also featured a space offering a new car, but the car could be won only once per episode. In 1980, this was replaced by two generic &quot;prize&quot; spaces, which worked the same way, along with only one Double space. In order for a tune to be worth double the value or to have a prize on the line, the corresponding space had to be covering the space where the inner wheel had stopped.

Both contestants kept the cash they earned.

====Other games====
These games were typically played during the second round:

* Build-a-Tune, played only on the short-lived 1977 daytime version, where the orchestra played a tune starting with minimal instrumentation and gradually added more until it became a full orchestral arrangement. Whoever named more tunes out of five received 10 points and a prize package. If both players were tied, each received five points and the prizes.
* Cassette Roulette, played during the first few months of the 1970s syndicated version, where contestants alternated selecting categories for songs from a board of eight 8-track tapes. Seven tunes were played, and the contestant who correctly named the most tunes won the round and 10 points. Four of the cassettes also contained a bonus prize, which would be awarded to the contestant who correctly named the tune.
* The Money Tree, where the contestants were both given a &quot;tree&quot; with 100 $1 bills on it. While one contestant tried to guess a tune, their opponent would remove bills from it as quickly as possible until that contestant guessed correctly or ran out of time. The contestant with the most money left on their tree at the end of the round earned 10 points and a prize package, though it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to see both trees stripped clean. The game was featured on the syndicated series from 1974 to 1977. It is also known to have been used at least once on the 1974 daytime series.
* Pick-a-Prize was another game played only on the 1977 daytime series, where the contestants were shown an assortment of prizes, then alternated between listening to tunes and trying to name them for a prize of their choice each time. The first player to name three tunes won the round and 10 points.
* Pick-a-Tune, where each tune would feature a list of words that included the words in the tune&#x27;s title. Contestants eliminated words so that only the words in the title remained. This game was featured early in the first season of the 1974 syndicated series.
* Ring That Bell was a recreation of the gameplay of the 1950s version, where contestants buzzed in to guess a tune by running to and ringing a bell. Five tunes were played, and the contestant who correctly guessed the most tunes won the round and 10 points. This game was seen only on the 1974 daytime series.
* Sing-a-Tune, where both contestants guessed the song being sung by house vocalist Kathie Lee Johnson (who replaced any instance of its title in the lyrics with &quot;la-las&quot;) by writing down the title. Five tunes were played and the winner of the round received 10 points and a prize package. If contestants were tied, each received the prize package and 5 points. The game was played only during the 1977–78 season, being retired when Johnson left the show.

==== Bid-a-Note ====
Bid-a-Note has typically been the final head-to-head round of the show, except from 1978 to 1981 and during the 1984–85 tournaments, when it was the penultimate round.

After being given a clue towards the song, the two contestants alternate bidding as to how few notes they need to identify it, starting as high as seven. Bidding ends when one contestant challenges the other to name the tune, or a bid of one note is given by a player to end the auction. Correctly identifying the song earns the contestant a point, while missing it gives the point to the opponent. The first to reach three points wins the game.

From 1978 to the end of the Kennedy run, players alternated choosing the tune to be played via displayed numbered packets.

==== Golden Medley ====
The main bonus round of &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, where the contestant must identify seven tunes within 30 seconds. The champion stops the clock by hitting a buzzer, a cue for the band to stop playing, and can either give an answer or pass if they are not sure. Once all seven tunes are played, the contestant may return to tunes passed if time permits. The game ends when a contestant identifies all seven tunes, runs out of time, or gives an incorrect answer.

On the 1974 daytime series, the winning player had to correctly identify six (later five) tunes. Each correct guess won $200, and $2,000 was awarded if the contestant guessed all six in 30 seconds. No matter what the result of the Golden Medley was, the champion returned the next day and played until they had won five times or had been defeated. Any champion that made it to a fifth day won a car.

Later in the run, corresponding with the change to five tunes, a champion was required to win the Golden Medley in order to return the next day. The car was awarded if the champion successfully completed the Golden Medley four times.

On the Tom Kennedy syndicated series, each tune was worth $500 in cash and/or prizes (usually, a contestant who got six won a car on the nighttime version), and any contestant who named all seven tunes won a $15,000 prize package. On the 1977 daytime version, each tune was worth $250, and all seven won a $2,500 prize package.

====The $100,000 Mystery Tune====
From 1976 to 1978, Golden Medley winners on the syndicated series were given a chance to win an additional $100,000 in cash at the conclusion of the next week&#x27;s episode by guessing the $100,000 Mystery Tune. A safe filled with large, sealed manila envelopes was placed in a room backstage, and one envelope was chosen at random; the producers made the choice in 1976, while the contestant did so starting in 1977. Each envelope held the sheet music for a different tune whose title had been blacked out, along with a smaller second envelope containing the title, composer name(s), and copyright/background information for the tune.

Once an envelope was chosen, it was brought onstage by a security guard, who gave the sheet music and the inner envelope to the orchestra&#x27;s pianist and the host respectively. The contestant entered an isolation booth wired so that they could hear only these two individuals, and the pianist played the tune for 20 seconds. The contestant was then given 10 seconds to offer one guess at the title, which was recorded on audiotape. The host opened the inner envelope and read its contents aloud, after which the contestant&#x27;s guess was played back and compared against the title. An exact match won $100,000, paid at $10,000 per year for 10 years.

When &quot;Name That Tune&quot; returned to daytime in 1977, the Mystery Tune round was brought along with it and played according to the same rules as the syndicated version. The prize for correctly naming the tune was a lump sum of $25,000.

On days when the Mystery Tune was played, the front game was abbreviated in order to leave time for it, such as by making Bid-a-Note a best-of-three round instead of best-of-five.

====$100,000 Tournaments====
In 1977, eleven Golden Medley winners who did not correctly identify the Mystery Tune were invited back to play in a three week tournament where the winner would receive $100,000 in cash and prizes. In the first two weeks, five or six players competed in an otherwise normal game, except that in &quot;Melody Roulette&quot;, only the first two players to answer two tunes continued. &quot;Sing a Tune&quot; and &quot;Bid a Note&quot; were then played for ten points between the remaining two players.

To determine the winner of the match, the Golden Medley became a competitive round of play instead of a bonus round and changed its name to the Golden Medley Showdown. Here, the two contestants tried to identify as many songs as they could within the thirty second time limit; a tune was discarded if neither player buzzed in within five seconds.

The two winners came back on the third week, playing &quot;Melody Roulette&quot;, &quot;Sing a Tune&quot;, and &quot;Bid a Note&quot; for 10 points each, and &quot;Golden Medley Showdown&quot; for 30, to determine the $100,000 winner. Unlike the mystery tune prize, this $100,000 was in cash and prizes. Runners-up won $2,500.

In 1978, the show (which had switched to a disco set and theme) discarded the Mystery Tunes and the entire season was set up to have four nine-week $100,000 tournaments. The first six weeks consisted of two-player games, featuring &quot;Melody Roulette&quot;, &quot;Bid-a-Note&quot;, and &quot;Golden Medley Showdown&quot;. The six winners returned for a three-week tournament, played like the 1977 tournament, except that three players played Melody Roulette and two of those players played the remaining two games. Every ninth episode would be a tournament final. The winner of each tournament won $10,000 a year for the next ten years, while the runner-up won a car. A number of celebrity specials filled out the season.

===1984 version===
The show was revived in 1984 as a daily series, with some of the same elements of the &#x27;70s series. Typical episodes featured Melody Roulette and the new game Tune Topics for 10 points each, and Bid-A-Note for 20; the day&#x27;s winner advanced to the Golden Medley, which if won, qualified the player for a monthly tournament for the grand prize.

(Note: one week of episodes featured a notably different set and theme music, as well as being the only episodes that split the points if a round ended in a tie, rather than playing a tie-breaker tune; they are assumed to be a &quot;pilot week&quot; despite airing later in the season, and will be referred to as such below.)

Melody Roulette: The outer wheel had one Double space (except for the pilot week wheel, which had three). Initially, the wheels were spun before every tune to determine its value, with the inner wheel displaying amounts from $100 to $500 in increments of $100, and only the winner of the round kept their cash. The maximum number of tunes was seven in the earliest episodes, but was reduced to five shortly thereafter. In a further later change, the inner wheel displayed amounts from $250 to $1000 in increments of $250, and one spin determined the award for the winner of the round. The maximum number of tunes was increased back to seven with this change.

Tune Topics: This was the second game of the day on all episodes except for the pilot week. The orchestra would play a maximum of five tunes with a specific theme. Originally, one topic was exclusively shown, but it was quickly changed to a presentation where one of five categories was shown to be chosen at random; however, it was obvious that the category was simply pre-selected as before. Ten points were given to the contestant who identified more tunes.

Tune Countdown: This was the second round for the pilot week, and was basically a 20-second version of the Golden Medley Showdown.

Bid-a-Note played the same, except the players no longer chose the clues by number. Bonus prizes were awarded to the winners of Tune Topics/Countdown and Bid-a-Note.

Golden Medley: Each tune was worth at least $250 in prizes, with an unspecified amount in prizes - usually including a vacation - awarded for naming all seven tunes, along with an entry into the monthly tournament.

$100,000 Tournament: Each episode varied in the number of contestants playing, which depended on how many of them qualified for the tournament. If more than two players were competing on any particular episode, a qualifying round was played in lieu of Melody Roulette, and the first two players to identify two tunes advanced to the next round. The two players then played Tune Topics and Bid-a-Note for 10 points each and the Golden Medley Showdown for 20. For games with two players, they played Melody Roulette and Tune Topics for 10 points each, Bid-a-Note for 20, and the Golden Medley Showdown for 40. The player with the most points at the end of the Golden Medley Showdown advanced in the tournament, with a sudden death tune played if necessary. The winner of each month&#x27;s tournament final received $10,000 in cash and $90,000 in prizes, while the runner-up won a vacation package for two.

The series actually began with its first tournament, as fourteen former $100,000 winners from the previous series were invited back for another shot at $100,000. There was one difference; the Golden Medley was played as normal for the first round of the tournament and the only way to advance was for a contestant to win it.

A home viewer sweepstakes was held in late 1984 in some non-tournament episodes. The day&#x27;s champion would draw a postcard from inside a giant drum to determine whom he/she would be playing for. Then, just before the Golden Medley began, the champion would draw a disk from inside a bin with the show&#x27;s logo on it; one of the tournament prizes would be displayed on the disk and if the champion won, then the home viewer would win that prize.

=== 2021 version ===
Each hour-long episode consists of two complete games, with two new contestants per game playing for cash through two rounds. In each round, an incorrect response by one contestant gives the opponent a chance to steal the money. Bid-a-Note is always played as the second round; the high scorer at its end keeps their entire winnings total and advances to the Golden Medley for a chance to win up to $100,000 more. Tunes in all first-round games are played as toss-ups, open for either contestant to buzz in; one tune also awards a bonus prize, which the contestant keeps regardless of the final outcome of the game.

Lyrics are sung in the first round, except for those that constitute the title. Six to eight tunes are played in each game, with each worth $1,000 (in the first season, tunes increased from $1,000 to $6,000). Some tunes missed by both contestants are edited out of the program.

The rotating first-round games include:

* By Request: A contestant chooses one category from a list of six or more, and a tune fitting it is played. The one who correctly names it gets to choose the next category, with the just-used one removed from the list.
* Mixtape: All tunes fit a single topic given by the host.
*On Shuffle: Contestants must name one tune by each of six different artists, chosen at random from a displayed list. Each artist is identified and removed from the list only after the tune has been named.
*Remix&#x27;d: Contestants must name a series of pop tunes as they are performed in a range of different styles. After a tune is correctly named, the house band performs it in its original style.
*Spin Me Round: An electronic wheel is spun before each turn to choose one of nine musical genres, and a tune from that genre is played.
* Title Track: Contestants must name tunes fitting a topic given by the host. Two topics are played, each with three tunes.
* Blank That Blank (introduced in season 3, and only used in some Celebrity episodes): A portion of the title for each tune is given before it is played.

Bid-a-Note is played second, with a maximum bid of 10 notes. If the low bidder misses, the opponent gets to hear all notes before responding (rather than scoring by default as before). Four tunes are played, with the first one worth $5,000 and the value increasing by $5,000 per subsequent tune up to $20,000 ($10,000-$25,000 in season 1).

The high scorer advances to the Golden Medley, played as in earlier versions, with seven tunes to be named in 30 seconds and no vocals. The contestant wins $10,000 for each of the first six correct responses and an additional $40,000 for the seventh, for a top prize of $100,000. For civilian contestants, a wrong answer ends the round, but they keep any money won; for celebrity contestants, a wrong answer forfeits the ability to win the $100,000, but they can still attempt the remaining tunes. A contestant may pass on a tune and return to it after hearing all seven if time permits.

== Broadcast history ==
&quot;Name That Tune&quot; ran in prime time from 1953 to 1954 on NBC, with Red Benson hosting. It moved to CBS in fall 1954, and hosting was taken up by Bill Cullen. George DeWitt took over in fall 1955 until the end of its run in October 1959. Notable contestants during this period included the young singer Leslie Uggams and child actor Eddie Hodges, who were followed by Betty Leary, a popular contestant whose 12 children filled the first row in the TV studio theater for seven consecutive shows. The series finished at #30 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1956–57 season. On October 18, 1959, CBS cancelled &quot;Tune&quot; in the wake of the quiz show scandals; its final episode aired on October 19, 1959.

In 1974, the best-remembered syndicated &quot;Name That Tune&quot; premiered, hosted by Tom Kennedy, and produced by Ralph Edwards in association with Sandy Frank Productions; it would become &quot;The $100,000 Name That Tune&quot; in 1976 and continue until 1981.

Also in 1974, NBC picked up a weekday version of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; for its daytime lineup, which ran from July 29, 1974 to January 3, 1975, and was hosted by Dennis James. A second iteration of the daytime version, this time hosted by Kennedy, ran on NBC from January 3 to June 10, 1977 (replacing the Kennedy-hosted &quot;50 Grand Slam&quot; in its timeslot). Both were lower-paying versions of the concurrent syndicated version.

&quot;The New $100,000 Name That Tune&quot; returned to syndication as a weekday series in 1984, hosted by Jim Lange and produced by Sandy Frank. It lasted one season.

=== Episode status ===
The 1984 syndicated series is fully intact and was rerun on American television on a fairly heavy basis for almost a decade. Christian Broadcasting Network (now Freeform) was the first to air reruns of the series, from September 2, 1985, to August 29, 1986. USA Network picked it up on January 2, 1989, and ran it until September 13, 1991. It then returned to the renamed The Family Channel (again, now Freeform), which aired it from June 7, 1993, to March 29, 1996. Prestige Entertainment Group, the format&#x27;s current distributor, holds the rights to the syndicated Kennedy and Lange versions.

20 episodes of the 1984-85 version were added to the streaming service Tubi in June 2021; they were removed in 2024.

==Revivals==
During the 1996-1997 season, an attempt to revived the show was made by Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainmentafter their normal producing partner Warner Bros. passed up on the project, they later went to Columbia TriStar Television in an attempt to possible pair up with a revival of 50s/70s/80s game show &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; but both were scrapped later on in their respective lifespans.

An attempt to revive the show in 2001 with producer Phil Gurin fell through. This would have been &quot;a game-variety hybrid,&quot; such as incorporating live performances.

In October 2006, CBS ordered a pilot for a revival with Donny Osmond as host, but it was not picked up for a series order. This attempt would have included a new bonus round where contestants guessed 15 songs in 60 seconds for a shot at $1 million.

In October 2007, it was reported that MTV Networks had bought the rights to the series and planned to create concurrent versions of the show to air on MTV, VH1 and CMT in 2008. Their musical content was to be tailored to the networks&#x27; respective formats and audiences (for example, the CMT version would have focused on country music), and the show was to be &quot;[reinterpreted] for the digital age&quot; with new online elements. None of these efforts ultimately made it to air.

In March 2012, it was reported that FremantleMedia had bought the rights and planned to revive the series. However, that plan never came to fruition.

In October 2017, CBS ordered another pilot for a revival, this time with Elizabeth Banks as host. However, it was not ordered to series.

=== 2021 revival ===
In October 2020, it was reported that Eureka Productions and current rightsholder Prestige Entertainment were preparing to begin production of a new version of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; in Sydney, Australia for an unspecified network, with American Australians as contestants. It was filmed with a studio audience under local COVID-19 protocols. Filming began on November 17 at ICC Sydney.

On November 18, 2020, Fox officially announced the series, with actress Jane Krakowski as host and former &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Randy Jackson as bandleader. Premiering on January 6, 2021 to accompany the &quot;Masked Singer&quot; spin-off &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot; on its Wednesday-night lineup, the series co-exists on Fox&#x27;s programming slate with its similar series &quot;Beat Shazam&quot;. It was co-produced by Eureka, Prestige, and Fox Alternative Entertainment.

A second season premiered on March 29, 2022, which primarily features celebrity episodes. Production was moved to Dublin, Ireland at the RDS and Font Hill Studios, with BiggerStage (which had previously collaborated with Fox Alternative Entertainment on its new talent show format &quot;The Big Deal&quot;) replacing Eureka as co-production partner.

A third season titled &quot;Celebrity Name That Tune&quot; premiered on January 11, 2023.

A fourth season premiered on June 3, 2024, and a fifth season was ordered for the 2024-2025 season as well.

==International versions==

===UK===
===Germany===
&quot;Hast du Töne?&quot; (Do you have sound?), hosted by Matthias Opdenhövel, aired daily on VOX from 1999 to 2001. Gameplay was somewhat different from the U.S. version, but the final round was the same as the Golden Medley. There has been a new edition of the show since 2024. 6 new episodes were produced. Both the band and the presenter are the same as before. The contestants are all celebrities.

===Russia===
&quot;Ugaday Melodiyu&quot; (Guess the Tune), hosted by Valdis Pelšs, aired daily on Channel One Russia from 1995 to 1999. It was produced by the VIDigital. The version was presented like the German version. Later, the series was presented as &quot;Ugadai i kompaniya&quot; (Guess and company) called &quot;Ugadaika&quot; (Guessing), by Pelsh also, but it was not as successful as the first version. In 2003, the program was revived and aired for two years on Channel One Russia. Gameplay remained the same and the only difference was the size of prizes.

On 2 January 2013, the program was once again revived, and since 2017, it has been aired during winter holidays. Starting from January 2023, the show continues to air without Fremantle&#x27;s involvement in the production due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

===Brazil===
&quot;Qual é a Música?&quot; (&quot;What Song Is It?&quot; or &quot;Which Song Is It?&quot;), hosted by Silvio Santos, has been a hit on Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão for the past two decades. On June 4, 2023, a revival version of the show was broadcast as a segment of Programa Silvio Santos, which currently hosted by Patricia Abravanel.

===Italy===
&quot;Il Musichiere&quot; (The Musician) aired on Saturdays from 1957 to 1960 on the then-called National Program, but it ended after the conductor Mario Riva accidentally fell from the stadium and subsequently died. &quot;Sarabanda&quot; (Sarabanda), aired from 1997 to 2004 and 2005 on Italia 1 and presented by Enrico Papi, in 2009 on Canale 5 by Teo Mammucari with participation of Belen Rodriguez and in 2017 again on Italia 1 with the return of Enrico Papi, in some games he was inspired by the 70s and 80s versions of &quot;Name That Tune&quot;. &quot;Name That Tune – Indovina la canzone&quot; is on air from September 2020 on TV8 in the first two editions with Papi, replaced in the third by Ciro Priello with the participation of Fabio Balsamo (both members of the comedy group of &quot;The Jackal&quot;), focuses on the challenge between two teams of famous people in Italy. This formula mixes the variety and the quiz.

===Poland===

&quot;Jaka to melodia?&quot; (What Melody Is It?) was first broadcast on September 4, 1997 on TVP1 and currently airs seven days a week. From 1997 to 2018 the show was hosted by Robert Janowski, an actor and singer. During the 2018/2019 season Norbi served as a host, but on September 7, 2019, that role was taken over by Rafał Brzozowski.

The show combines a standard music quiz and musical performances performed by either the host, the in-house band and singers or guests (including artists who perform given song originally). Three players compete at the beginning of each episode which consists of four rounds (including the final round – Golden Medley). The grand prize for a finalist who successfully completes the Golden Medley is PLN 10,000 in a regular episode and PLN 80,000 in the finale of the month or the finale of the year (although formerly the grand prize of the finale was PLN 10,000 and a car). Typically, episodes aired on Saturdays and Sundays feature celebrities (unless the finale of the month is played), whose appearance on the show, and the style of episodes of that kind, is criticised by the program&#x27;s fans.

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese version was called &quot;Nốt nhạc vui&quot; (Happy Notes). 272 episodes of the show aired from January 14, 2004, to March 25, 2009. It became popular and was among the most-watched TV series of Ho Chi Minh City Television. Thanh Bạch is the host of that version.

===Lebanon===
&quot;شو إسم اللحن؟&quot; (Name that Tune), is hosted by Maya Diab, airs weekly on Saturdays on LBCI starting on January 6, 2024. It is produced by the LBCI.

== &quot;Name That Video&quot; ==
&quot;Name That Video&quot; was a variation of the series that aired in 2001 on VH1. The show was hosted by Karyn Bryant and featured contestants competing to name song titles by viewing the music video. The show&#x27;s credits note the use of &quot;Name That Tune (Video)&quot; by permission.

== Merchandise ==
=== Arcade game ===
In 1986, a coin-operated arcade game based on the 1984 version of the show was released by Bally/Sente Technologies, created by Owen Rubin. The show&#x27;s bandleader, Tommy Oliver, was hired as the game&#x27;s music consultant. The player&#x27;s task was to guess the tune being played from among four choices. It also featured a two-player mode.

While playable, critics and players considered the machine&#x27;s difficulty to be high due to the technical limits of the very basic synthesized music the machine was capable of generating, and songs being too difficult to name mostly because the wrong audience was targeted as teenage players of the arcade era simply weren&#x27;t interested in trying to name songs from the 1940s through the 1970s. Critics also believed the game would have served better as a tabletop unit for bars and other adult-oriented entertainment establishments instead of as an arcade game.

The game only utilized three of the six games shown in the 1984 version of the show, Tune Topics, Bid-a-Note, and The Golden Medley. The game required the player to score 18,000 points, playing five tunes apiece in the Tune Topics and Bid-a-Note rounds. In Tune Topics, the player scored up to 990 points per tune based on how quickly they named it. In Bid-a-Note, the value of each tune was determined by how many notes the player requested, starting at 100 for nine and increasing by 100 for each note below that threshold (to a maximum of 900 for one). For both rounds, the player had to correctly name at least three out of five tunes in order to score a bonus that started at 9,900 points and counted down throughout the round.

If the player failed to score at least 18,000 points after both rounds, the game ended immediately. Reaching this minimum allowed the player to enter the Golden Medley, with the goal of naming five tunes in 15 seconds. Each tune had three choices instead of four; the fourth button could be used to pass. Tunes were scored as in Tune Topics, and successfully completing the round awarded a bonus as in the other two rounds. If time ran out or the player made an incorrect guess, the game ended and the bonus was forfeited.

Sente had developed several different upgrade chips for the game containing different musical selections and game modes, but it is unknown if they were shelved or destroyed as the game was a flop.

=== Video game ===
A game based on the show was released for the short-lived CD-i home console. This version was hosted by Bob Goen and was based on the unsold 1990 Peter Allen version of the show.

=== Mobile phone game ===
In 2003, a mobile phone version of the game appeared on major U.S. cellular providers. The game follows the traditional format, with MIDI interpretations of popular and classic music played in short clips. The player then has several seconds to correctly identify the tune. Prizes such as free ringtones were available, a first in the mobile industry. The game is often mentioned as a pioneer in the emerging wireless entertainment industry.

=== DVD games ===
In 2005, Imagination Games released a DVD game called &quot;Name That Tune: 80s Edition&quot;. The DVD game featured elements from the TV show, as well as &quot;Name That Video&quot;, like the Bid-A-Vid round.

In 2007, Imagination Games re-released &quot;Name That Tune: 80s Edition&quot;, under the new name &quot;Name That Tune Eighties&quot;.

<text>Erysimum franciscanum, commonly known as the Franciscan wallflower or San Francisco wallflower, is a plant endemic to the northern California coast, from Sonoma to Santa Cruz Counties. It is a member of the genus &quot;Erysimum&quot; in the mustard family, the Brassicaceae.

The plant is a biennial or short-lived perennial. The flowers are cream-colored to yellow, with four sepals and four petals arranged in a cross shape, as is characteristic of the Brassicaceae. It flowers from late winter to late spring. The plant prefers open scrubby areas with a fair amount of sunlight, but can flourish on a range of soils including disintegrating serpentine, gravelly and sandy soils. It is fairly easily cultivated in gardens.

Although not formally recognized as endangered, the Franciscan wallflower has a limited, discontinuous distribution. It is monitored at the Presidio of San Francisco, which was also its type locality. The plant is propagated in a nursery there and then planted in its native habitat.

<text>David William Davis (April 23, 1873 – August 5, 1959) was an American politician who served as the 12th governor of Idaho from 1919 to 1923. He later served briefly as commissioner of the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 1923 and 1925. He later became a special assistant to the United States Secretary of the Interior.

==Early life==
Davis was born in Cardiff, Wales. His family immigrated to the United States in 1875 and settled near Rippey, Iowa. Rippey, located 35 miles northwest of Des Moines, was then a major coal-mining community. This was before strict child labor laws, and Davis began working in the coal mines in 1885 when he was twelve years old.

== Career ==
After a few years in the mines, Davis landed a job in the mining company store in Dawson, Iowa, about five miles south of Rippey. Personable and hard-working, Davis showed a talent for the retail business. That led to a position as the manager of a local Farmer&#x27;s Cooperative Association. Almost immediately thereafter, he became cashier at a bank in Rippey. At that time, the Cashier in a small bank could be more than what is known simply as a Teller in the United States. A chief cashier was a very high-level position, able to issue cashier&#x27;s checks against the bank&#x27;s reserves. In view of his later career in banking, it seems likely that Davis attained that level of responsibility. It is known that, lacking much formal schooling, he also followed a program of diligent self-education.

He reportedly spent a brief stint in the United States Navy, attaining the rank of Petty Officer, First Class after distinguished service in the Philippines. According to later accounts, Davis continued to suffer the ill effects of his time in the mines. Coupled with his intense efforts on and off the job, deteriorating health finally forced him to take a year or so off for a rest cure.

In 1907, Davis helped organize the First National Bank of American Falls. Over the next several years, he aggressively promoted the town and its farm interests. At some point, Davis&#x27; parents followed him to American Falls, where his father lived until his death in 1913.

Davis also became very active in the Republican Party in Idaho. In 1912, he served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. He also served as a member of the Idaho Senate from 1913 to 1915.

===Governor of Idaho===
Davis won the Republican nomination for governor in 1916, but was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent, Moses Alexander. Davis was nominated again in 1918 and defeated Democrat H. F. Samuels. ex-governor James H. Hawley said that, for various reasons, &quot;A great many of the old time Democrats in the state refused to support Mr. Samuels.&quot; Davis won by a margin of 57,626 to 38,499 votes. He was reelected in 1920. Although the election was a three-way race, Davis received 53 percent of the votes, out-polling his nearest rival by 75,748 to 38,509.

During his tenure, funding was sanctioned for the establishment of the bureau of budget and taxation, plus a veteran&#x27;s welfare program and a teacher&#x27;s pension system. A road-building program was initiated, the state&#x27;s statutes were reorganized, the state&#x27;s administrative agencies were unified, and three constitutional amendments were sanctioned.

Davis left office on January 1, 1923.

===Later life===
Along with his political career, Davis stayed heavily involved with banking, even after he moved to Boise when he was first elected as governor. That interest led to his election as president of the Idaho State Bankers Association in 1918.

Davis also took an active interest in irrigation projects, especially those promoted by the Carey Act along the Snake River. During his term as governor, Davis organized a meeting in Salt Lake City for fifteen of the arid western states to discuss water issues. Out of that meeting grew the Western States Reclamation Association, to provide a united voice for advice to the U. S. government on federally funded irrigation projects.

Two months after Davis left the governor&#x27;s office, he was appointed as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Interior, to supervise the United States Reclamation Service and served until 1924. He then served from 1924 to 1932 as director of finance for the Interior Department, and for a short time in 1931 as a special advisor to President Herbert Hoover.

After his service with the federal government, Davis returned to his Idaho banking interests and also expanded his investments in mining ventures in the Northwest. Governor David W. Davis died on August 5, 1959, and was buried at the Cloverdale Cemetery in Boise, Idaho.

== Personal life ==
In 1903, Davis&#x27;s first wife, the former Florence O. Gilliland, died. Two years later, he married Nellie Johnson, whose father owned a bank that merged with the one where Davis worked. The following year, the couple moved to American Falls, Idaho, which he had apparently observed during his rest cure.

<text>Generative grammar is a research tradition in linguistics that aims to explain the cognitive basis of language by formulating and testing explicit models of humans&#x27; subconscious grammatical knowledge. Generative linguists, or generativists (), tend to share certain working assumptions such as the competence–performance distinction and the notion that some domain-specific aspects of grammar are partly innate in humans. These assumptions are rejected in non-generative approaches such as usage-based models of language. Generative linguistics includes work in core areas such as syntax, semantics, phonology, psycholinguistics, and language acquisition, with additional extensions to topics including biolinguistics and music cognition.

Generative grammar began in the late 1950s with the work of Noam Chomsky, having roots in earlier approaches such as structural linguistics. The earliest version of Chomsky&#x27;s model was called Transformational grammar, with subsequent iterations known as Government and binding theory and the Minimalist program. Other present-day generative models include Optimality theory, Categorial grammar, and Tree-adjoining grammar.

== Principles ==

Generative grammar is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to linguistics. What unites these approaches is the goal of uncovering the cognitive basis of language by formulating and testing explicit models of humans&#x27; subconscious grammatical knowledge.

=== Cognitive science ===

Generative grammar studies language as part of cognitive science. Thus, research in the generative tradition involves formulating and testing hypotheses about the mental processes that allow humans to use language.

Like other approaches in linguistics, generative grammar engages in linguistic description rather than linguistic prescription.

=== Explicitness and generality ===

Generative grammar proposes models of language consisting of explicit rule systems, which make testable falsifiable predictions. This is different from traditional grammar where grammatical patterns are often described more loosely. These models are intended to be parsimonious, capturing generalizations in the data with as few rules as possible. For example, because English imperative tag questions obey the same restrictions that second person future declarative tags do, Paul Postal proposed that the two constructions are derived from the same underlying structure. By adopting this hypothesis, he was able to capture the restrictions on tags with a single rule. This kind of reasoning is commonplace in generative research.

Particular theories within generative grammar have been expressed using a variety of formal systems, many of which are modifications or extensions of context free grammars.

=== Competence versus performance ===

Generative grammar generally distinguishes linguistic competence and linguistic performance. Competence is the collection of subconscious rules that one knows when one knows a language; performance is the system which puts these rules to use. This distinction is related to the broader notion of Marr&#x27;s levels used in other cognitive sciences, with competence corresponding to Marr&#x27;s computational level.

For example, generative theories generally provide competence-based explanations for why English speakers would judge the sentence in (1) as odd. In these explanations, the sentence would be ungrammatical because the rules of English only generate sentences where demonstratives agree with the grammatical number of their associated noun.

:(1) *That cats is eating the mouse.

By contrast, generative theories generally provide performance-based explanations for the oddness of center embedding sentences like one in (2). According to such explanations, the grammar of English could in principle generate such sentences, but doing so in practice is so taxing on working memory that the sentence ends up being unparsable.

:(2) *The cat that the dog that the man fed chased meowed.

In general, performance-based explanations deliver a simpler theory of grammar at the cost of additional assumptions about memory and parsing. As a result, the choice between a competence-based explanation and a performance-based explanation for a given phenomenon is not always obvious and can require investigating whether the additional assumptions are supported by independent evidence. For example, while many generative models of syntax explain island effects by positing constraints within the grammar, it has also been argued that some or all of these constraints are in fact the result of limitations on performance.

Non-generative approaches often do not posit any distinction between competence and performance. For instance, usage-based models of language assume that grammatical patterns arise as the result of usage.

=== Innateness and universality ===

A major goal of generative research is to figure out which aspects of linguistic competence are innate and which are not. Within generative grammar, it is generally accepted that at least some domain-specific aspects are innate, and the term &quot;universal grammar&quot; is often used as a placeholder for whichever those turn out to be.

The idea that at least some aspects are innate is motivated by poverty of the stimulus arguments. For example, one famous poverty of the stimulus argument concerns the acquisition of yes-no questions in English. This argument starts from the observation that children only make mistakes compatible with rules targeting hierarchical structure even though the examples which they encounter could have been generated by a simpler rule that targets linear order. In other words, children seem to ignore the possibility that the question rule is as simple as &quot;switch the order of the first two words&quot; and immediately jump to alternatives that rearrange constituents in tree structures. This is taken as evidence that children are born knowing that grammatical rules involve hierarchical structure, even though they have to figure out what those rules are. The empirical basis of poverty of the stimulus arguments has been challenged by Geoffrey Pullum and others, leading to back-and-forth debate in the language acquisition literature. Recent work has also suggested that some recurrent neural network architectures are able to learn hierarchical structure without an explicit constraint.

Within generative grammar, there are a variety of theories about what universal grammar consists of. One notable hypothesis proposed by Hagit Borer holds that the fundamental syntactic operations are universal and that all variation arises from different feature-specifications in the lexicon. On the other hand, a strong hypothesis adopted in some variants of Optimality Theory holds that humans are born with a universal set of constraints, and that all variation arises from differences in how these constraints are ranked. In a 2002 paper, Noam Chomsky, Marc Hauser and W. Tecumseh Fitch proposed that universal grammar consists solely of the capacity for hierarchical phrase structure.

In day-to-day research, the notion that universal grammar exists motivates analyses in terms of general principles. As much as possible, facts about particular languages are derived from these general principles rather than from language-specific stipulations.

== Subfields ==

Research in generative grammar spans a number of subfields. These subfields are also studied in non-generative approaches.

=== Syntax ===

Syntax studies the rule systems which combine smaller units such as morphemes into larger units such as phrases and sentences. Within generative syntax, prominent approaches include Minimalism, Government and binding theory, Lexical-functional grammar (LFG), and Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG).

=== Phonology ===

Phonology studies the rule systems which organize linguistic sounds. For example, research in phonology includes work on phonotactic rules which govern which phonemes can be combined, as well as those that determine the placement of stress, tone, and other suprasegmental elements. Within generative grammar, a prominent approach to phonology is Optimality Theory.

=== Semantics ===

Semantics studies the rule systems that determine expressions&#x27; meanings. Within generative grammar, semantics is a species of formal semantics, providing compositional models of how the denotations of sentences are computed on the basis of the meanings of the individual morphemes and their syntactic structure.

== Extensions ==

=== Music ===

Generative grammar has been applied to music theory and analysis since the 1980s. One notable approach is Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff&#x27;s Generative theory of tonal music, which formalized and extended ideas from Schenkerian analysis. 

=== Biolinguistics ===

Recent work in generative-inspired biolinguistics has proposed that universal grammar consists solely of syntactic recursion, and that it arose recently in humans as the result of a random genetic mutation. Generative-inspired biolinguistics has not uncovered any particular genes responsible for language. While some prospects were raised at the discovery of the &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene, there is not enough support for the idea that it is &#x27;the grammar gene&#x27; or that it had much to do with the relatively recent emergence of syntactical speech.

== History ==

As a distinct research tradition, generative grammar began in the late 1950s with the work of Noam Chomsky. However, its roots include earlier structuralist approaches such as glossematics which themselves had older roots, for instance in the work of the ancient Indian grammarian Pāṇini. Military funding to generative research was an important factor in its early spread in the 1960s.

The initial version of generative syntax was called transformational grammar. In transformational grammar, rules called transformations mapped a level of representation called deep structures to another level of representation called surface structure. The semantic interpretation of a sentence was represented by its deep structure, while the surface structure provided its pronunciation. For example, an active sentence such as &quot;The doctor examined the patient&quot; and &quot;The patient was examined by the doctor&quot;, had the same deep structure. The difference in surface structures arises from the application of the passivization transformation, which was assumed to not affect meaning. This assumption was challenged in the 1960s by the discovery of examples such as &quot;Everyone in the room knows two languages&quot; and &quot;Two languages are known by everyone in the room&quot;.

After the Linguistics wars of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chomsky developed a revised model of syntax called Government and binding theory, which eventually grew into Minimalism. In the aftermath of those disputes, a variety of other generative models of syntax were proposed including relational grammar, Lexical-functional grammar (LFG), and Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG). 

Generative phonology originally focused on rewrite rules, in a system commonly known as &quot;SPE Phonology&quot; after the 1968 book The Sound Pattern of English by Chomsky and Morris Halle. In the 1990s, this approach was largely replaced by Optimality theory, which was able to capture generalizations called conspiracies which needed to be stipulated in SPE phonology.

Semantics emerged as a subfield of generative linguistics during the late 1970s, with the pioneering work of Richard Montague. Montague proposed a system called Montague grammar which consisted of interpretation rules mapping expressions from a bespoke model of syntax to formulas of intensional logic. Subsequent work by Barbara Partee, Irene Heim, Tanya Reinhart, and others showed that the key insights of Montague Grammar could be incorporated into more syntactically plausible systems.

<text>David J. Davis (November 22, 1870 – November 19, 1942) was an American politician and military officer who served as the 13th lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania from 1923 to 1927. Davis was a member of the Republican Party. 

== Life and career ==
Davis was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1894, gained a commission as first lieutenant during the Spanish–American War, and deployed to the US-Mexico border in 1916.

<text>A spoken game is a game which uses words instead of cards, boards, game pieces, or other paraphernalia.

Spoken games can often also be categorized as guessing games, word games, or because of their freedom from equipment or visual engagement, car games.

Well-known spoken games include Twenty Questions, I spy, and Password. Because of their nature, spoken games are usually non-commercial.

<doc id="444523" wikidata="Q3784980" url="?curid=444523" title="Henry More Smith">
<text>Henry More Smith (fl. 19th century.) (also known as Henry Frederick Moon, Henry J. Moon, Henry Hopkins, Henry Frederick More Smith and William Newman) was a Canadian conman, puppeteer, hypnotist, and escape artist who lived for a while in New Brunswick, Canada. 

==Biography==
Although he is believed to have been an Englishman born in Brighton, England, his origins are clouded by what he told people at the time. On one occasion he was asked where he had come from, he laughed and pointed outside to the full Moon.

He arrived in Windsor in 1812 as Frederic Henry More. After staying with a family in the village of Rawdon, Nova Scotia, he eloped with and married their daughter, a girl named Elizabeth P. Bond, on March 12, 1813, in Windsor. He fathered three children with her. Winkworth, Elenor, and Josiah. He worked as a pedlar-tailor. He took orders for coats and made them up by stealing a similar coat. He was caught after a victim recognized his coat on another man.

In July 1814 he arrived in Saint John, New Brunswick, this time as Henry More Smith. He was caught on July 24 and imprisoned in the Kings Co. Jail as a horse thief. Visitors to the jail can see the cell where he was kept. He faked an illness so well that housewives sent special foods to his bedside, one even sent him a feather bed to die on. While the jailer and a clergymen were heating a brick for his chilled back, Smith vanished into the night.

Allegedly, on more than one occasion when a posse was combing the countryside for him, searchers discovered afterwards that he had been a member of the posse the day before. Recaptured again and awaiting trial for horse stealing, Smith pretended to be insane. In his cell they found Smith had fashioned an elaborate marionette show out of his bed straw and shreds of his clothing. There were ten characters in all and Smith would whistle a tune while a puppet clanged a tambourine and all the characters danced to the tune.

Smith&#x27;s act so deeply impressed the authorities that he received a pardon on condition he would leave New Brunswick and never return.

According to Walter Bates, his jailer and later biographer, the last sighting of Smith was in Newgate, Simsbury, Connecticut in 1816.

==Cultural references==
The Lunar Rogue Pub, located in the city of Fredericton, New Brunswick has a supposed portrait of him on their signage.

In 2010, the life of Henry More Smith was dramatized by the Next Folding Theatre Company in a play titled &quot;Henry Moon: Conducts and Mischiefs of the Lunar Rogue&quot; This production will be staged again in early 2023 by Youth Theatre Station, with performances in Hampton, New Brunswick.

<text>MySQL AB was a Swedish software company founded in 1995. It was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008, Sun was in turn acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010. MySQL AB is the creator of MySQL, a relational database management system, as well as related products such as MySQL Cluster. The company was dually headquartered in Uppsala, Sweden, and Cupertino, California, with offices in other countries (France (Paris), Germany (Munich), Ireland (Dublin), Italy (Milan), and Japan (Tokyo)).

MySQL AB had 400 employees in 25 countries, and Open-source model companies. Around 70% of the employees were remote workers.

Together with Linux, Apache, and PHP, the MySQL Server forms one of the building blocks of the LAMP technology stack. The company claimed over 5 million MySQL installations and over 10 million product downloads in 2004.

== Revenue ==
MySQL AB representatives are commonly cited as champions of what they claim to be a &quot;second generation&quot; of open source companies. The revenues of both first and second generation open source companies usually derive from selling support, consulting services, and training for their products. What generally distinguishes this &quot;second generation&quot; of companies, such as MySQL AB and Trolltech, from earlier &quot;open source&quot; business models is dual licensing — the software is supplied under an open source license, but traditional software licences are also sold by the company that owns the software. As an example, MySQL AB makes MySQL available under the GPL at no charge, but sells it under other more traditional licenses to clients who do not find the GPL to be ideal for their purposes, such as inclusion of MySQL AB technology in a closed source product.

Other sources of revenue for MySQL AB were providing support and consulting, as well as training and certification for MySQL Server. Together with some additional services, MySQL also provided a subscription-based product called MySQL Enterprise, which is also resold by other companies such as Dell, HP, and Novell.

==History==

<text>Matthias Weckmann (&quot;Weckman&quot;) (&quot;c&quot;.1616 24 February 1674) was a German musician and composer of the Baroque period. He was born in Niederdorla (Thuringia) and died in Hamburg.

==Life==
His musical training took place in Dresden (as a chorister at the Saxon Court, under the direction of Heinrich Schütz), then in Hamburg where he worked with the famous organist Jacob Praetorius at the Saint Peter&#x27;s church (Petrikirche).

He was introduced to the Italian concertato, polychoral and monodic styles — because Schütz had journeyed in Italy when a young man and he had met Giovanni Gabrieli and Monteverdi — as well as the style of Sweelinck&#x27;s pupils, some of whom had settled in Hamburg. Weckmann travelled to Denmark in 1637 with Schütz, became organist in Dresden at the Electoral Court of Saxony from 1638 to 1642, and returned to Denmark until 1647 (during the Thirty Years&#x27; War).

During a new (and his last) stay in Dresden from 1649 to 1655, he met Johann Jakob Froberger during a musical competition which had been organized by the Elector. They remained friends and in correspondence with each other. In 1655, after a competition, he was named titular organist at Saint James church (Jakobkirche) in Hamburg, and spent his remaining life there. He founded a renowned orchestral ensemble, the so-called &quot;Collegium Musicum&quot; in Hamburg. This was the most productive period of his life: his compositions of this time include a collection of 1663, which set sacred texts mentioning the terrible plague which killed his first wife and many of his colleagues in Hamburg that year, including Heinrich Scheidemann.

He died in Hamburg and was buried in a family grave in St. James&#x27;s Church beneath the organ.

==Works==
Weckmann composed chorale preludes and music for the organ and harpsichord that mixes Italian and French influences, various sonatas for three or four instruments, and orchestral and vocal sacred music. Stylistically, he mostly followed the progressive tendencies of Schütz, including the concertato idiom and the trend to increasing chromaticism and contrapuntal and motivic complexity. In this regard, he went against the prevailing trends of the time towards simplification, much of which can be seen in Schütz&#x27;s later music. Weckmann is a good example of a composer whose works would have been completely lost to history, had it not been for the 19th century interest in researching the predecessors of J.S. Bach.

<doc id="444541" wikidata="Q271710" url="?curid=444541" title="Dilophosaurus">
<text>Dilophosaurus ( ) is a genus of theropod dinosaurs that lived in what is now North America during the Early Jurassic, about 186 million years ago. Three skeletons were discovered in northern Arizona in 1940, and the two best preserved were collected in 1942. The most complete specimen became the holotype of a new species in the genus &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, named &quot;M. wetherilli&quot; by Samuel P. Welles in 1954. Welles found a larger skeleton belonging to the same species in 1964. Realizing it bore crests on its skull, he assigned the species to the new genus &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; in 1970, as Dilophosaurus wetherilli. The genus name means &quot;two-crested lizard&quot;, and the species name honors John Wetherill, a Navajo councilor. Further specimens have since been found, including an infant. Fossil footprints have also been attributed to the animal, including resting traces. Another species, &quot;Dilophosaurus sinensis&quot; from China, was named in 1993, but was later found to belong to the genus &quot;Sinosaurus&quot;.

At about in length, with a weight of about , &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was one of the earliest large predatory dinosaurs and the largest known land-animal in North America at the time. It was slender and lightly built, and the skull was proportionally large, but delicate. The snout was narrow, and the upper jaw had a gap or kink below the nostril. It had a pair of longitudinal, arched crests on its skull; their complete shape is unknown, but they were probably enlarged by keratin. The mandible was slender and delicate at the front, but deep at the back. The teeth were long, curved, thin, and compressed sideways. Those in the lower jaw were much smaller than those of the upper jaw. Most of the teeth had serrations at their front and back edges. The neck was long, and its vertebrae were hollow, and very light. The arms were powerful, with a long and slender upper arm bone. The hands had four fingers; the first was short but strong and bore a large claw, the two following fingers were longer and slenderer with smaller claws; the fourth was vestigial. The thigh bone was massive, the feet were stout, and the toes bore large claws.

&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; has been considered a member of the family Dilophosauridae along with &quot;Dracovenator&quot;, a group placed between the Coelophysidae and later theropods, but some researchers have not found support for this grouping. &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; would have been active and bipedal, and may have hunted large animals; it could also have fed on smaller animals and fish. Due to the limited range of movement and shortness of the forelimbs, the mouth may instead have made first contact with prey. The function of the crests is unknown; they were too weak for battle, but may have been used in visual display, such as species recognition and sexual selection. It may have grown rapidly, attaining a growth rate of per year early in life. The holotype specimen had multiple paleopathologies, including healed injuries and signs of a developmental anomaly. &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; is known from the Kayenta Formation, and lived alongside dinosaurs such as &quot;Scutellosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sarahsaurus&quot;. It was designated as the state dinosaur of Connecticut based on tracks found there. &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was featured in the novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and its movie adaptation, where it was given the fictional abilities to spit venom and expand a neck frill, and was depicted as smaller than the real animal.
==History of discovery==
In the summer of 1942, the paleontologist Charles L. Camp led a field party from the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) in search of fossil vertebrates in Navajo County in northern Arizona. Word of this was spread among the Native Americans there, and the Navajo Jesse Williams brought three members of the expedition to some fossil bones he had discovered in 1940. The area was part of the Kayenta Formation, about north of Cameron near Tuba City in the Navajo Indian Reservation. Three dinosaur skeletons were found in purplish shale, arranged in a triangle, about long at one side. The first was nearly complete, lacking only the front of the skull, parts of the pelvis, and some vertebrae. The second was very eroded, included the front of the skull, lower jaws, some vertebrae, limb bones, and an articulated hand. The third was so eroded that it consisted only of vertebral fragments. The first good skeleton was encased in a block of plaster after 10 days of work and loaded onto a truck, the second skeleton was easily collected, as it was almost entirely weathered out of the ground, but the third skeleton was almost gone.

The nearly complete first specimen was cleaned and mounted at the UCMP under supervision of the paleontologist Wann Langston, a process that took three men two years. The skeleton was wall-mounted in bas relief, with the tail curved upwards, the neck straightened, and the left leg moved up for visibility, but the rest of the skeleton was kept in its burial position. As the skull was crushed, it was reconstructed based on the back of the skull of the first specimen and the front of the second. The pelvis was reconstructed after that of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and the feet were also reconstructed. At the time, it was one of the best-preserved skeletons of a theropod dinosaur, though incomplete. In 1954, the paleontologist Samuel P. Welles, who was part of the group who excavated the skeletons, preliminarily described and named this dinosaur as a new species in the existing genus &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, &quot;M. wetherilli&quot;. The nearly complete specimen (catalogued as UCMP 37302) was made the holotype of the species, and the second specimen (UCMP 37303) was made the paratype. The specific name honored John Wetherill, a Navajo councilor whom Welles described as an &quot;explorer, friend of scientists, and trusted trader&quot;. Wetherill&#x27;s nephew, Milton, had first informed the expedition of the fossils. Welles placed the new species in &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; due to the similar limb proportions of it and &quot;M. bucklandii&quot;, and because he did not find great differences between them. At the time, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was used as a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;, wherein many species of theropods were placed, regardless of their age or locality.

Welles returned to Tuba City in 1964 to determine the age of the Kayenta Formation (it had been suggested to be Late Triassic in age, whereas Welles thought it was Early to Middle Jurassic), and discovered another skeleton about south of where the 1942 specimens had been found. The nearly complete specimen (catalogued as UCMP 77270) was collected with the help of William J. Breed of the Museum of Northern Arizona and others. During preparation of this specimen, it became clear that it was a larger individual of &quot;M. wetherilli&quot;, and that it would have had two crests on the top of its skull. Being a thin plate of bone, one crest was originally thought to be part of the missing left side of the skull, which may had been pulled out of its position by a scavenger. When it became apparent that it was a crest, it was also realized that a corresponding crest would have been on the left side, since the right crest was right of the midline, and was concave along its middle length. This discovery led to re-examination of the holotype specimen, which was found to have bases of two thin, upwards-extended bones, which were crushed together. These also represented crests, but they had formerly been assumed to be part of a misplaced cheek bone. The two 1942 specimens were also found to be juveniles, while the 1964 specimen was an adult, about one-third larger than the others. Welles later recalled that he thought the crests were as unexpected as finding &quot;wings on a worm&quot;.

===New genus and subsequent discoveries===

Welles and an assistant subsequently corrected the wall mount of the holotype specimen based on the new skeleton, by restoring the crests, redoing the pelvis, making the neck ribs longer, and placing them closer together. After studying the skeletons of North American and European theropods, Welles realized that the dinosaur did not belong to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, and needed a new genus name. At that time, no other theropods with large longitudinal crests on their heads were known, and the dinosaur had therefore gained the interest of paleontologists. A mold of the holotype specimen was made, and fiberglass casts of it were distributed to various exhibits; to make labeling these casts easier, Welles decided to name the new genus in a brief note, rather than wait until the publication of a detailed description. In 1970, Welles coined the new genus name &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, from the Greek words &quot;di&quot; (&quot;δι&quot;) meaning &quot;two&quot;, &quot;lophos&quot; (&quot;λόφος&quot;) meaning &quot;crest&quot;, and &quot;sauros&quot; () meaning &quot;lizard&quot;: &quot;two-crested lizard&quot;. Welles published a detailed osteological description of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; in 1984, but did not include the 1964 specimen, since he thought it belonged to a different genus. &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was the first well-known theropod from the Early Jurassic, and remains one of the best-preserved examples of that age.

In 2001, the paleontologist Robert J. Gay identified the remains of at least three new &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimens (this number is based on the presence of three pubic bone fragments and two differentially sized femora) in the collections of the Museum of Northern Arizona. The specimens were found in 1978 in the Rock Head Quadrangle, away from where the original specimens were found, and had been labeled as a &quot;large theropod&quot;. Though most of the material is damaged, it is significant in including elements not preserved in the earlier specimens, including part of the pelvis and several ribs. Some elements in the collection belonged to an infant specimen (MNA P1.3181), the youngest known example of this genus, and one of the earliest known infant theropods from North America, only preceded by some &quot;Coelophysis&quot; specimens. The juvenile specimen includes a partial humerus, a partial fibula, and a tooth fragment. In 2005, paleontologist Ronald S. Tykoski assigned a specimen (TMM 43646-140) from Gold Spring, Arizona, to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, but in 2012, paleontologist Matthew T. Carrano and colleagues found it to differ in some details.

In 2020, the paleontologists Adam D. Marsh and Timothy B. Rowe comprehensively redescribed &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; based on the by then known specimens, including specimen UCMP 77270 which had remained undescribed since 1964. They also removed some previously assigned specimens, finding them too fragmentary to identify, and relocated the type quarry with the help of a relative of Jesse Williams. In an interview, Marsh called &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; the &quot;best worst-known dinosaur&quot;, since the animal was poorly understood despite having been discovered 80 years earlier. A major problem was that previous studies of the specimens did not make clear which parts were original fossils and which were reconstructed in plaster, yet subsequent researchers only had Welles&#x27; 1984 monograph to rely on for subsequent studies, muddling understanding of the dinosaur&#x27;s anatomy. Marsh spent seven years studying the specimens to clarify the issues surrounding the dinosaur, including two specimens found two decades earlier by Rowe, his Ph.D. advisor.

===Formerly assigned species===

In 1984, Welles suggested that the 1964 specimen (UCMP 77270) did not belong to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, but to a new genus, based on differences in the skull, vertebrae, and femora. He maintained that both genera bore crests, but that the exact shape of these was unknown in &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. Welles died in 1997, before he could name this supposed new dinosaur, and the idea that the two were separate genera has generally been ignored or forgotten since. In 1999, amateur paleontologist Stephan Pickering privately published the new name &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; &quot;breedorum&quot; based on the 1964 specimen, named in honor of Breed, who had assisted in collecting it. This name is considered a&quot; nomen nudum&quot;, an invalidly published name, and Gay pointed out in 2005 that no significant differences exist between &quot;D&quot;. &quot;breedorum&quot; and other &quot;D. wetherilli&quot; specimens. In 2012, Carrano and colleagues found differences between the 1964 specimen and the holotype specimen, but attributed them to variation between individuals rather than species. Paleontologists Christophe Hendrickx and Octávio Mateus suggested in 2014 that the known specimens might represent two species of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; based on different skull features and stratigraphic separation, pending thorough description of assigned specimens. Marsh and Rowe concluded in 2020 that there was only one taxon among known &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimens, and that differences between them were due to their different degree of maturity and preservation. They did not find considerable stratigraphic separation between the specimens either.

A nearly complete theropod skeleton (KMV 8701) was discovered in the Lufeng Formation, in Yunnan Province, China, in 1987. It is similar to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, with a pair of crests and a gap separating the premaxilla from the maxilla, but differs in some details. The paleontologist Shaojin Hu named it as a new species of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; in 1993, &quot;D. sinensis&quot; (from Greek &quot;Sinai&quot;, referring to China). In 1998, the paleontologist Matthew C. Lamanna and colleagues found &quot;D. sinensis&quot; to be identical to &quot;Sinosaurus triassicus&quot;, a theropod from the same formation, named in 1940. This conclusion was confirmed by paleontologist Lida Xing and colleagues in 2013, and though paleontologist Guo-Fu Wang and colleagues agreed the species belonged in &quot;Sinosaurus&quot; in 2017, they suggested it may be a separate species, &quot;S. sinensis&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was one of the earliest large predatory dinosaurs, a medium-sized theropod, though small compared to some of the later theropods. It was also the largest known land-animal of North America during the Early Jurassic. Slender and lightly built, its size was comparable to that of a brown bear. The largest known specimen weighed about , measured about in length, and its skull was long. The smaller holotype specimen weighed about , was long, with a hip height of about , and its skull was long. A resting trace of a theropod similar to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Liliensternus&quot; has been interpreted by some researchers as showing impressions of feathers around the belly and feet, similar to down. Other researchers instead interpret these impressions as sedimentological artifacts created as the dinosaur moved, though this interpretation does not rule out that the track-maker could have borne feathers.

===Skull===

The skull of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was large in proportion to the overall skeleton, yet delicate. The snout was narrow in front view, becoming narrower towards the rounded top. The premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was long and low when seen from the side, bulbous at the front, and its outer surface became less convex from snout to naris (bony nostril). The nostrils were placed further back than in most other theropods. The premaxillae were in close articulation with each other, and while the premaxilla only connected to the maxilla (the following bone of the upper jaw) at the middle of the palate, with no connection at the side, they formed a strong joint through the robust, interlocking articulation between the hindwards and forwards directed processes of these bones. Hindwards and below, the premaxilla formed a wall for a gap between itself and the maxilla called the subnarial gap (also termed a &quot;kink&quot;). Such a gap is also present in coelophysoids, as well as other dinosaurs. The subnarial gap resulted in a diastema, a gap in the tooth row (which has also been called a &quot;notch&quot;). Within the subnarial gap was a deep excavation behind the toothrow of the premaxilla, called the subnarial pit, which was walled by a downwards keel of the premaxilla.

The outer surface of the premaxilla was covered in foramina (openings) of varying sizes. The upper of the two backward-extending processes of the premaxilla was long and low, and formed most of the upper border of the elongated naris. It had a dip towards the font, which made the area by its base concave in profile. The underside of the premaxilla containing the alveoli (tooth sockets) was oval. The maxilla was shallow, and was depressed around the antorbital fenestra (a large opening in front of the eye), forming a recess that was rounded towards the front, and smoother than the rest of the maxilla. A foramen called the preanteorbital fenestra opened into this recess at the front bend. Large foramina ran on the side of the maxilla, above the alveoli. A deep nutrient groove ran backward from the subnarial pit along the base of the interdental plates (or rugosae) of the maxilla.
&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; bore a pair of high, thin, and arched (or plate-shaped) crests longitudinally on the skull roof. The crests (termed the nasolacrimal crests) began as low ridges on the premaxillae and were mainly formed by the upwards expanded and . These bones were coossified together (fusion during bone tissue formation), so the sutures between them cannot be determined. The lacrimal bone expanded into a thick, rugose boss, forming an arc at the upper front border of the orbit (eye socket), and supported the bottom of the back of the crest. Uniquely for this genus, the rim above the orbit continued hindwards and ended in a small, almost triangular process behind the orbit, which curved slightly outwards. Since only a short part of the upper surface of this process is unbroken, the rest of the crest may have risen above the skull over a distance of ~. The preserved part of the crest in UCMP 77270 is tallest around the midpoint of the antorbital fenestra&#x27;s length. UCMP 77270 preserves the concave shelf between the bases of the crests, and when seen from the front, they are projected upwards and to the sides at an ~80° angle. Welles found the crests reminiscent of a double-crested cassowary, while Marsh and Rowe stated they were probably covered in keratin or keratinized skin. They pointed out that by comparison with helmeted guineafowl, the keratin on the crests of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; could have enlarged them much more than what is indicated by the bone. As only one specimen preserves much of the crests, whether they differed between individuals is unknown. CT scans show that air sacs (pockets of air that provide strength for and lighten bones) were present in the bones that surrounded the brain, and were continuous with the sinus cavities in the front of the skull. The antorbital fenestra was continuous with the side of the crests, which indicates the crests also had air sacs (a ridge of bone forms a roof over the antorbital fenestrae in most other theropods).
The orbit was oval, and narrow towards the bottom. The jugal bone had two upwards-pointing processes, the first of which formed part of the lower margin of the antorbital fenestra, and part of the lower margin of the orbit. A projection from the quadrate bone into the lateral temporal fenestra (opening behind the eye) gave this a reniform (kidney-shaped) outline. The foramen magnum (the large opening at the back of the braincase) was about half the breadth of the occipital condyle, which was itself (heart-shaped), and had a short neck and a groove on the side. The mandible was slender and delicate at the front, but the articular region (where it connected with the skull) was massive, and the mandible was deep around the mandibular fenestra (an opening on its side). The mandibular fenestra was small in &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, compared to that of coelophysoids, and reduced from front to back, uniquely for this genus. The dentary bone (the front part of the mandible where most of the teeth there were attached) had an up-curved rather than pointed chin. The chin had a large foramen at the tip, and a row of small foramina ran in rough parallel with the upper edge of the dentary. On the inner side, the mandibular symphysis (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) was flat and smooth, and showed no sign of being fused with its opposite half. A Meckelian foramen ran along the outer side of the dentary. The side surface of the had a unique pyramidal process in front of the articulation with the quadrate, and this horizontal ridge formed a shelf. The process of the mandible (a backwards projection) was long.

&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; had four teeth in each premaxilla, 12 in each maxilla, and 17 in each dentary. The teeth were generally long, thin, and recurved, with relatively small bases. They were compressed sideways, oval in cross-section at the base, lenticular (lens-shaped) above, and slightly concave on their outer and inner sides. The largest tooth of the maxilla was either in or near the fourth alveolus, and the height of the tooth crowns decreased hindwards. The first tooth of the maxilla pointed slightly forwards from its alveolus because the lower border of the premaxilla process (which projected backward towards the maxilla) was upturned. The teeth of the dentary were much smaller than those of the maxilla. The third or fourth tooth in the dentary of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and some coelophysoids was the largest there, and seems to have fit into the subnarial gap of the upper jaw. Most of the teeth had serrations on the front and back edges, which were offset by vertical grooves, and were smaller at the front. About 31 to 41  serrations were on the front edges, and 29 to 33 were on the back. At least the second and third teeth of the premaxilla had serrations, but the fourth tooth did not. The teeth were covered in a thin layer of enamel, thick, which extended far towards their bases. The alveoli were elliptical to almost circular, and all were larger than the bases of the teeth they contained, which may therefore have been loosely held in the jaws. Though the number of alveoli in the dentary would seem to indicate that the teeth were very crowded, they were rather far apart, due to the larger size of their alveoli. The jaws contained replacement teeth at various stages of eruption. The interdental plates between the teeth were very low.

===Postcranial skeleton===

&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; had 10 cervical (neck), 14 dorsal (back), and 45 caudal (tail) vertebrae, and air sacs grew into the vertebrae. It had a long neck, which was probably flexed nearly 90° by the skull and by the shoulder, holding the skull in a horizontal posture. The cervical vertebrae were unusually light; their centra (the &quot;bodies&quot; of the vertebrae) were hollowed out by (depressions on the sides) and centrocoels (cavities on the inside). The arches of the cervical vertebrae also had pneumatic fossae (or chonoses), conical recesses so large that the bones separating them were sometimes paper-thin. The centra were plano-concave, flat to weakly convex at the front and deeply cupped (or concave) at the back, similar to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. This indicates that the neck was flexible, though it had long, overlapping cervical ribs, which were fused to the centra. The cervical ribs were slender and may have bent easily.

The atlas bone (the first cervical vertebra which attaches to the skull) had a small, cubic centrum, and had a concavity at the front where it formed a cup for the occipital condyle (protuberance that connects with the atlas vertebra) at the back of the skull. The axis bone (the second cervical vertebra) had a heavy spine, and its postzygapophyses (the processes of the vertebrae that articulated with the prezygapophyses of a following vertebrae) were met by long prezygapophyses that curved upwards from the third cervical vertebra. The centra and neural spines of the cervical vertebrae were long and low, and the spines were stepped in side view, forming &quot;shoulders&quot; at the front and back, as well as taller, central &quot;caps&quot; that gave the appearance of a Maltese cross (cruciform) when seen from above, distinctive features of this dinosaur. The posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina of the cervicals showed serial variation, bifurcating and reuniting down the neck, a unique feature. The neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae were also low and expanded front and back, which formed strong attachments for ligaments. Uniquely for this genus, additional laminae emanated from the middle trunk vertebrae&#x27;s anterior centrodiapophyseal laminae and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae. The sacral vertebrae which occupied the length of the ilium blade did not appear to be fused. The rib of the first sacral vertebra articulated with the preacetabular process of the ilium, a distinct feature. The centra of the caudal vertebrae were very consistent in length, but their diameter became smaller towards the back, and they went from elliptical to circular in cross-section.

The scapulae (shoulder blades) were moderate in length and concave on their inner sides to follow the body&#x27;s curvature. The scapulae were wide, particularly the upper part, which was rectangular (or squared off), a unique feature. The coracoids were elliptical, and not fused to the scapulae. The lower hind portions of the coracoids had a &quot;horizontal buttress&quot; next to the biceps tuber, unique for this genus. The arms were powerful, and had deep pits and stout processes for attachment of muscles and ligaments. The humerus (upper arm bone) was large and slender, and the ulna (lower arm bone) was stout and straight, with a stout olecranon. The hands had four fingers: the first was shorter but stronger than the following two fingers, with a large claw, and the two following fingers were longer and slenderer, with smaller claws. The claws were curved and sharp. The third finger was reduced, and the fourth was vestigial (retained, but without function).

The crest of the ilium was highest over the ilial peduncle (the downwards process of the ilium), and its outer side was concave. The foot of the pubic bone was only slightly expanded, whereas the lower end was much more expanded on the ischium, which also had a very thin shaft. The hind legs were large, with a slighter longer femur (thigh bone) than tibia (lower leg bone), the opposite of, for example, &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. The femur was massive; its shaft was sigmoid-shaped (curved like an &#x27;S&#x27;), and its greater trochanter was centered on the shaft. The tibia had a developed tuberosity and was expanded at the lower end. The astragalus bone (ankle bone) was separated from the tibia and the calcaneum, and formed half of the socket for the fibula. It had long, stout feet with three well-developed toes that bore large claws, which were much less curved than those of the hand. The third toe was the stoutest, and the smaller first toe (the hallux) was kept off the ground.

==Classification==

Welles thought &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; a megalosaur in 1954, but revised his opinion in 1970 after discovering that it had crests. By 1974, Welles and the paleontologist Robert A. Long found &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; to be a ceratosauroid. In 1984 Welles found that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; exhibited features of both Coelurosauria and Carnosauria, the two main groups into which theropods had hitherto been divided, based on body size, and he suggested this division was inaccurate. He found &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; to be closest to those theropods that were usually placed in the family Halticosauridae, particularly &quot;Liliensternus&quot;.

In 1988, paleontologist Gregory S. Paul classified the halticosaurs as a subfamily of the family Coelophysidae, and suggested that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; could have been a direct descendant of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. Paul also considered the possibility that spinosaurs were late-surviving dilophosaurs, based on similarity of the kinked snout, nostril position, and slender teeth of &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. In 1994, paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz placed &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; in the group Coelophysoidea, along with but separate from the Coelophysidae. He placed the Coelophysoidea in the group Ceratosauria. In 2000, paleontologist James H. Madsen and Welles divided Ceratosauria into the families Ceratosauridae and Dilophosauridae, with &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; as the sole member of the latter family.

Lamanna and colleagues pointed out in 1998 that since &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was discovered to have had crests on its skull, other similarly crested theropods have been discovered (including &quot;Sinosaurus&quot;), and that this feature is, therefore, not unique to the genus, and of limited use for determining interrelationships within their group. Paleontologist Adam M. Yates described the genus &quot;Dracovenator&quot; from South Africa in 2005, and found it closely related to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Zupaysaurus&quot;. His cladistic analysis suggested they did not belong in the Coelophysoidea, but rather in the Neotheropoda, a more derived (or &quot;advanced&quot;) group. He proposed that if &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was more derived than the Coelophysoidea, the features it shared with this group may have been inherited from basal (or &quot;primitive&quot;) theropods, indicating that theropods may have passed through a &quot;coelophysoid stage&quot; in their early evolution.

In 2007, paleontologist Nathan D. Smith and colleagues found the crested theropod &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; to be the sister species of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, and grouped them with &quot;Dracovenator&quot; and &quot;Sinosaurus&quot;. This clade was more derived than the Coelophysoidea, but more basal than the Ceratosauria, thereby placing basal theropods in a ladder-like arrangement. In 2012, Carrano and colleagues found that the group of crested theropods proposed by Smith and colleagues was based on features that relate to the presence of such crests, but that the features of the rest of the skeleton were less consistent. They instead found that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was a coelophysoid, with &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sinosaurus&quot; being more derived, as basal members of the group Tetanurae.

Paleontologist Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues defined the Dilophosauridae to include &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dracovenator&quot; in 2015, and noted that while general uncertainty exists about the placement of this group, it appears to be slightly more derived than the Coelophysoidea, and the sister group to the Averostra. The Dilophosauridae share features with the Coelophysoidea such as the subnarial gap and the front teeth of the maxilla pointing forwards, while features shared with Averostra include a fenestra at the front of the maxilla and a reduced number of teeth in the maxilla. They suggested that the cranial crests of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sinosaurus&quot; had either evolved convergently, or were a feature inherited from a common ancestor. The following cladogram is based on that published by Hendrickx and colleagues, itself based on earlier studies:


In 2019, paleontologists Marion Zahner and Winand Brinkmann found the members of the Dilophosauridae to be successive basal sister taxa of the Averostra rather than a monophyletic clade (a natural group), but noted that some of their analyses did find the group valid, containing &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dracovenator&quot;, &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;, and possibly &quot;Notatesseraeraptor&quot; as the basal-most member. They therefore provided a diagnosis for the Dilophosauridae, based on features in the lower jaw. In the phylogenetic analysis accompanying their 2020 redescription, Marsh and Rowe found all specimens of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; to form a monophyletic group, sister to Averostra, and more derived than &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;. Their analysis did not find support for Dilophosauridae, and they suggested cranial crests were a plesiomorphic (ancestral) trait of Ceratosauria and Tetanurae.

==Ichnology==

Various ichnotaxa (taxa based on trace fossils) have been attributed to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; or similar theropods. In 1971, Welles reported dinosaur footprints from the Kayenta Formation of northern Arizona, on two levels and below where the original &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimens were found. The lower footprints were tridactyl (three-toed), and could have been made by &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;; Welles created the new ichnogenus and species &quot;Dilophosauripus williamsi&quot; based on them, in honor of Williams, the discoverer of the first &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; skeletons. The type specimen is a cast of a large footprint catalogued as UCMP 79690-4, with casts of three other prints included in the hypodigm. In 1984, Welles conceded that no way had been found to prove or disprove that the footprints belonged to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. In 1996, the paleontologists Michael Morales and Scott Bulkey reported a trackway of the ichnogenus &quot;Eubrontes&quot; from the Kayenta Formation made by a very large theropod. They noted it could have been made by a very large &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; individual, but found that unlikely, as they estimated the trackmaker would have been tall at the hips, compared to the of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;.

The paleontologist Gerard Gierliński examined tridactyl footprints from the Holy Cross Mountains in Poland and concluded in 1991 that they belonged to a theropod like &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. He named the new ichnospecies &quot;Grallator&quot; (&quot;Eubrontes&quot;) &quot;soltykovensis&quot; based on them, with a cast of footprint MGIW 1560.11.12 as the holotype. In 1994 Gierliński also assigned footprints from the Höganäs Formation in Sweden discovered in 1974 to &quot;G. (E.) soltykovensis&quot;. In 1996, Gierliński attributed track AC 1/7 from the Turners Falls Formation of Massachusetts, a resting trace he believed to show feather impressions, to a theropod similar to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Liliensternus&quot;, and assigned it to the ichnotaxon &quot;Grallator minisculus&quot;. The paleontologist Martin Kundrát agreed that the track showed feather impressions in 2004, but this interpretation was disputed by the paleontologist Martin Lockley and colleagues in 2003 and the paleontologist Anthony J. Martin and colleagues in 2004, who considered them as sedimentological artifacts. Martin and colleagues also reassigned the track to the ichnotaxon &quot;Fulicopus lyellii&quot;. Gierliński and Karol Sabath responded at a conference talk in 2005, pointing out that the algae mat imprint would not only have been present on the stomach, but also the footprints. Based on detailed photos and experiments, they found the traces similar to those left by the fibrous feathers (semiplumes) of modern birds, and different from those left by a scaly body.
The paleontologist Robert E. Weems proposed in 2003 that &quot;Eubrontes&quot; tracks were not produced by a theropod, but by a sauropodomorph similar to &quot;Plateosaurus&quot;, excluding &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; as a possible trackmaker. Instead, Weems proposed &quot;Kayentapus hopii&quot;, another ichnotaxon named by Welles in 1971, as the best match for &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. The attribution to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was primarily based on the wide angle between digit impressions three and four shown by these tracks, and the observation that the foot of the holotype specimen shows a similarly splayed-out fourth digit. Also in 2003, paleontologist Emma Rainforth argued that the splay in the holotype foot was merely the result of distortion, and that &quot;Eubrontes&quot; would indeed be a good match for &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;.
The paleontologist Spencer G. Lucas and colleagues stated in 2006 that virtually universal agreement existed that &quot;Eubrontes&quot; tracks were made by a theropod like &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, and that they and other researchers dismissed Weems&#x27; claims.

In 2006, Weems defended his 2003 assessment of &quot;Eubrontes&quot;, and proposed an animal like &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; as the possible trackmaker of numerous &quot;Kayentapus&quot; trackways of the Culpeper Quarry in Virginia. Weems suggested rounded impressions associated with some of these trackways to represent hand impressions lacking digit traces, which he interpreted as a trace of quadrupedal movement. Milner and colleagues used the new combination &quot;Kayentapus soltykovensis&quot; in 2009, and suggested that &quot;Dilophosauripus&quot; may not be distinct from &quot;Eubrontes&quot; and &quot;Kayentapus&quot;. They suggested that the long claw marks that were used to distinguish &quot;Dilophosauripus&quot; may be an artifact of dragging. They found that &quot;Gigandipus&quot; and &quot;Anchisauripus&quot; tracks may likewise also just represent variations of &quot;Eubrontes&quot;. They pointed out that differences between ichnotaxa may reflect how the trackmaker interacted with the substrate rather than taxonomy. They also found &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; to be a suitable match for a &quot;Eubrontes&quot; trackway and resting trace (SGDS 18.T1) from the St. George dinosaur discovery site in the Moenave Formation of Utah, though the dinosaur itself is not known from the formation, which is slightly older than the Kayenta Formation. 

Weems stated in 2019 that &quot;Eubrontes&quot; tracks do not reflect the gracile feet of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, and argued they were instead made by the bipedal sauropodomorph &quot;Anchisaurus&quot;. In a 2024 review of Jurassic tracks, the paleontologist John R. Foster and colleagues stated that few other ichnologists had accepted Weems&#x27; sauropodomorph interpretation of &quot;Eubrontes&quot;, partially because such tracks are abundant in places where no sauropodomorph fossils have been found.
==Paleobiology==

===Feeding and diet===
Welles found that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; did not have a powerful bite, due to weakness caused by the subnarial gap. He thought that it used its front premaxillary teeth for plucking and tearing rather than biting, and the maxillary teeth further back for piercing and slicing. He thought that it was probably a scavenger rather than a predator, and that if it did kill large animals, it would have done so with its hands and feet rather than its jaws. Welles did not find evidence of cranial kinesis in the skull of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, a feature that allows individual bones of the skull to move in relation to each other. In 1986, the paleontologist Robert T. Bakker instead found &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, with its massive neck and skull and large upper teeth, to have been adapted for killing large prey, and strong enough to attack any Early Jurassic herbivores. In 1988, Paul dismissed the idea that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was a scavenger, and claimed that strictly scavenging terrestrial animals are a myth. He stated that the snout of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was better braced than had been thought previously, and that the very large, slender maxillary teeth were more lethal than the claws. Paul suggested that it hunted large animals such as prosauropods, and that it was more capable of snapping small animals than other theropods of a similar size.

A 2005 beam-theory study by the palaeontologist François Therrien and colleagues found that the bite force in the mandible of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; decreased rapidly hindwards in the tooth-throw. This indicates that the front of the mandible, with its upturned chin, &quot;rosette&quot; of teeth, and strengthened symphyseal region (similar to spinosaurids), was used to capture and manipulate prey, probably of relatively smaller size. The properties of its mandibular symphysis were similar to those of felids and crocodilians that use the front of their jaws to deliver a powerful bite when subduing prey. The loads exerted on the mandibles were consistent with struggle of small prey, which may have been hunted by delivering slashing bites to wound it, and then captured with the front of the jaws after being too weakened to resist. The prey may then have been moved further back into the jaws, where the largest teeth were located, and killed by slicing bites (similar to some crocodilians) with the sideways-compressed teeth. The authors suggested that if &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; indeed fed on small prey, possible hunting packs would have been of limited size.

Milner and paleontologist James I. Kirkland suggested in 2007 that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; had features that indicate it may have eaten fish. They pointed out that the ends of the jaws were expanded to the sides, forming a &quot;rosette&quot; of interlocking teeth, similar to those of spinosaurids, known to have eaten fish, and gharials, which is the modern crocodile that eats the most fish. The nasal openings were also retracted back on the jaws, similar to spinosaurids, which have even more retracted nasal openings, and this may have limited water splashing into the nostrils during fishing. Both groups also had long arms with well-developed claws, which could help when catching fish. Lake Dixie, a large lake that extended from Utah to Arizona and Nevada, would have provided abundant fish in the &quot;post-cataclysmic&quot;, biologically more impoverished world that followed the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event (wherein about three quarters of life on Earth vanished), 5 to 15 million years before &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; appeared.
In 2018, Marsh and Rowe reported that the holotype specimen of the sauropodomorph &quot;Sarahsaurus&quot; bore possible tooth marks scattered across the skeleton that may have been left by &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; (&quot;Syntarsus&quot; was too small to have produced them) scavenging the specimen after it died (the positions of the bones may also have been disturbed by scavenging). An example of such marks can be seen on the left scapula, which has an oval depression on the surface of its upper side, and a large hole on the lower front end of the right tibia. The quarry where the holotype and paratype specimens of &quot;Sarahsaurus&quot; were excavated also contained a partial immature &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimen. Marsh and Rowe suggested in 2020 that many of the features that distinguished &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; from earlier theropods were associated with increased body size and macropredation (preying on large animals). While Marsh and Rowe agreed that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; could have fed on fish and small prey in the fluvial system in its environment, they pointed out that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla of the upper jaw was immobile and much more robust than previously thought, and that large-bodied prey could have been grasped and manipulated with the forelimbs during predation and scavenging. They considered the large bite marks on &quot;Sarahsaurus&quot; specimens alongside shed teeth and the presence of a &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimen within the same quarry as support for this idea.

In a 2021 article, paleontologist Matthew A. Brown and Rowe stated that these remains showed that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; had jaws strong enough to puncture bone. The fleshy air sacs from its respiratory system that grew into the vertebrae both strengthened and lightened the skeleton, and allowed unidirectional airflow through its lungs, similar to birds and crocodiles, and thereby more oxygen than a bidirectional respiratory system of mammals (wherein the air flows in and out of the lungs). Unidirectional breathing indicates relatively high metabolic rates and therefore high levels of activity, indicating that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was likely a fast, agile hunter. Brown and Rowe considered &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; to have been an apex predator in its ecosystem, and not a scavenger.

===Motion===

Welles envisioned &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; as an active, clearly bipedal animal, similar to an enlarged ostrich. He found the forelimbs to have been powerful weapons, strong and flexible, and not used for locomotion. He noted that the hands were capable of grasping and slashing, of meeting each other, and reaching two-thirds up the neck. He proposed that in a sitting posture, the animal would rest on the large &quot;foot&quot; of its ischium, as well as its tail and feet. In 1990, paleontologists Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas suggested that the weak pelvis of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; could have been an adaptation for an aquatic lifestyle, where the water would help support its weight, and that it could have been an efficient swimmer. They found it doubtful that it would have been restricted to a watery environment, though, due to the strength and proportions of its hind limbs, which would have made it fleet-footed and agile during bipedal locomotion. Paul depicted &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; bouncing on its tail while lashing out at an enemy, similar to a kangaroo.

In 2005, paleontologists Phil Senter and James H. Robins examined the range of motion in the forelimbs of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and other theropods. They found that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; would have been able to draw its humerus backward until it was almost parallel with the scapula, but could not move it forwards to a more than vertical orientation. The elbow could approach full extension and flexion at a right angle, but not achieve it completely. The fingers do not appear to have been voluntarily hyperextensible (able to extend backwards, beyond their normal range), but they may have been passively hyperextensible, to resist dislocation during violent movements by captured prey. A 2015 article by Senter and Robins gave recommendations for how to reconstruct the fore limb posture in bipedal dinosaurs, based on examination of various taxa, including &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. The scapulae were held very horizontally, the resting orientation of the elbow would have been close to a right angle, and the orientation of the hand would not have deviated much from that of the lower arm.
In 2018, Senter and Corwin Sullivan examined the range of motion in the fore limb joints of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; by manipulating the bones, to test hypothesized functions of the fore limbs. They also took into account that experiments with alligator carcasses show that the range of motion is greater in elbows covered in soft tissue (such as cartilage, ligaments, and muscles) than what would be indicated by manipulation of bare bones. They found that the humerus of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; could be retracted into a position that was almost parallel with the scapula, protracted to an almost vertical level, and elevated 65°. The elbow could not be flexed past a right angle to the humerus. Pronation and supination of the wrists (crossing the radius and ulna bones of the lower arm to turn the hand) was prevented by the radius and ulna joints not being able to roll, and the palms, therefore, faced medially, towards each other. The inability to pronate the wrists was an ancestral feature shared by theropods and other dinosaur groups. The wrist had limited mobility, and the fingers diverged during flexion, and were very hyperextensible.

Senter and Sullivan concluded that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was able to grip and hold objects between two hands, to grip and hold small objects in one hand, to seize objects close beneath the chest, to bring an object to the mouth, to perform a display by swinging the arms in an arc along the sides of the ribcage, to scratch the chest, belly, or the half of the other forelimb farthest from the body, to seize prey beneath the chest or the base of the neck, and to clutch objects to the chest. &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was unable to perform scratch-digging, hook-pulling, to hold objects between two fingertips of one hand, to maintain balance by extending the arms outwards to the sides, or to probe small crevices like the modern aye aye does. The hyperextensibility of the fingers may have prevented the prey&#x27;s violent struggle from dislocating them, since it would have allowed greater motion of the fingers (with no importance to locomotion). The limited mobility of the shoulder and shortness of the forelimbs indicates that the mouth made first contact with the prey rather than the hands. Capture of prey with the forelimbs would only be possible for seizing animals small enough to fit beneath the chest of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, or larger prey that had been forced down with its mouth. The great length of the head and neck would have enabled the snout to extend much further than the hands.

The &quot;Dilophosauripus&quot; footprints reported by Welles in 1971 were all on the same level, and were described as a &quot;chicken yard hodge-podge&quot; of footprints, with few forming a trackway. The footprints had been imprinted in mud, which allowed the feet to sink down . The prints were sloppy, and the varying breadth of the toe prints indicates that mud had clung to the feet. The impressions varied according to differences in the substrate and the manner in which they were made; sometimes, the foot was planted directly, but often a backward or forward slip occurred as the foot came down. The positions and angles of the toes also varied considerably, which indicate they must have been quite flexible. The &quot;Dilophosauripus&quot; footprints had an offset second toe with a thick base, and very long, straight claws that were in line with the axes of the toe pads. One of the footprints was missing the claw of the second toe, perhaps due to injury. In 1984, Welles interpreted the fact that three individuals were found close together, and the presence of criss-crossed trackways nearby, as indications that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; traveled in groups. Gay agreed that they may have traveled in small groups, but noted that no direct evidence supported this, and that flash floods could have picked up scattered bones from different individuals and deposited them together.

Milner and colleagues examined the possible &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; trackway SGDS 18.T1 in 2009, which consists of typical footprints with tail drags and a more unusual resting trace, deposited in lacustrine beach sandstone. The trackway began with the animal first oriented approximately in parallel with the shoreline, and then stopping by a berm with both feet in parallel, whereafter it lowered its body, and brought its metatarsals and the callosity around its ischium to the ground; this created impressions of symmetrical &quot;heels&quot; and circular impressions of the ischium. The part of the tail closest to the body was kept off the ground, whereas the end further away from the body made contact with the ground. The fact that the animal rested on a slope is what enabled it to bring both hands to the ground close to the feet. After resting, the dinosaur shuffled forwards, and left new impressions with its feet, metatarsals, and ischium, but not the hands. The right foot now stepped on the print of the right hand, and the second claw of the left foot made a drag mark from the first resting position to the next. After some time, the animal stood up and moved forwards, with the left foot first, and once fully erect, it walked across the rest of the exposed surface, while leaving thin drag marks with the end of the tail.

Crouching is a rarely captured behavior of theropods, and SGDS 18.T1 is the only such track with unambiguous impressions of theropod hands, which provides valuable information about how they used their forelimbs. The crouching posture was found to be very similar to that of modern birds, and shows that early theropods held the palms of their hands facing medially, towards each other. As such a posture therefore evolved early in the lineage, it may have characterized all theropods.
Theropods are often depicted with their palms facing downwards, but studies of their functional anatomy have shown that they, like birds, were unable to pronate or supinate their arms. The track showed that the legs were held symmetrically with the body weight distributed between the feet and the metatarsals, which is also a feature seen in birds such as ratites. Milner and colleagues also dismissed the idea that the &quot;Kayentapus minor&quot; track reported by Weems showed a palm imprint made by a quadrupedally walking theropod. Weems had proposed the trackmaker would have been able to move quadrupedally when walking slowly, while the digits would have been habitually hyperextended so only the palms touched the ground. Milner and colleagues found the inferred pose unnecessary, and suggested the track was instead made in a similar way as SGDS 18.T1, but without leaving traces of the digits.

===Crest function===
Welles conceded that suggestions as to the function of the crests of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; were conjectural, but thought that, though the crests had no grooves to indicate vascularization, they could have been used for thermoregulation. He also suggested they could have been used for species recognition or ornamentation. Bakker considered the crests sexual adornments in 1986, noting they were so thin that they could only have been for visual effect, unlike the heavier crests of allosaurs, which could have been used for head-butting. The Czerkas pointed out in 1990 that the crests could not have been used during battle, as their delicate structure would have been easily damaged. They suggested that they were a visual display for attracting a mate, and even thermoregulation. In 1990, paleontologist Walter P. Coombs stated that the crests may have been enhanced by colors for use in display.

In 2011 the paleontologists Kevin Padian and John R. Horner proposed that &quot;bizarre structures&quot; in dinosaurs in general (including crests, frills, horns, and domes) were primarily used for species recognition, and dismissed other explanations as unsupported by evidence. They noted that too few specimens of cranially ornamented theropods, including &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, were known to test their evolutionary function statistically, and whether they represented sexual dimorphism or sexual maturity. In a response to Padian and Horner the same year, the paleontologists Rob J. Knell and Scott D. Sampson argued that species recognition was not unlikely as a secondary function for &quot;bizarre structures&quot; in dinosaurs, but that sexual selection (used in display or combat to compete for mates) was a more likely explanation, due to the high cost of developing them, and because such structures appear to be highly variable within species.

In 2013, paleontologists David E. Hone and Darren Naish criticized the &quot;species recognition hypothesis&quot;, and argued that no extant animals use such structures primarily for species recognition, and that Padian and Horner had ignored the possibility of mutual sexual selection (where both sexes are ornamented). Marsh and Rowe agreed in 2020 that the crests of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; likely had a role in species identification or intersexual/intrasexual selection, as in some modern birds. It is unknown if the air sacs in the crests supported such functions.

===Development===
Welles originally interpreted the smaller &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimens as juveniles, and the larger specimen as an adult, later interpreting them as different species. Paul suggested that the differences between the specimens was perhaps due to sexual dimorphism, as was seemingly also apparent in &quot;Coelophysis&quot;, which had &quot;robust&quot; and &quot;gracile&quot; forms of the same size, that might otherwise have been regarded as separate species. Following this scheme, the smaller &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimen would represent a &quot;gracile&quot; example.

In 2005 Tykoski found that most &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimens known were juvenile individuals, with only the largest an adult, based on the level of co-ossification of the bones. In 2005 Gay found no evidence of the sexual dimorphism suggested by Paul (but supposedly present in &quot;Coelophysis&quot;), and attributed the variation seen between &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; specimens to individual variation and ontogeny (changes during growth). There was no dimorphism in the skeletons, but he did not rule out that there could have been in the crests; more data was needed to determine this. Based on the tiny nasal crests on a juvenile specimen, Yates had tentatively assigned to the related genus &quot;Dracovenator&quot;, he suggested that these would have grown larger as the animal became adult.

The paleontologist J.S. Tkach reported a histological study (microscopical study of internal features) of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; in 1996, conducted by taking thin-sections of long bones and ribs of specimen UCMP 37303 (the lesser preserved of the two original skeletons). The bone tissues were well vascularized and had a fibro-lamellar structure similar to that found in other theropods and the sauropodomorph &quot;Massospondylus&quot;. The plexiform (woven) structure of the bones suggested rapid growth, and &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; may have attained a growth rate of per year early in life.

Welles found that the replacement teeth of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and other theropods originated deep inside the bone, decreasing in size the farther they were from the alveolar border. There were usually two or three replacement teeth in the alveoli, with the youngest being a small, hollow crown. The replacement teeth erupted on the outer side of the old teeth. When a tooth neared the gum line, the inner wall between the interdental plates was resorbed and formed a nutrient notch. As the new tooth erupted, it moved outwards to center itself in the alveolus, and the nutrient notch closed over.

===Paleopathology===

Welles noted various paleopathologies (ancient signs of disease, such as injuries and malformations) in &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. The holotype had a sulcus (groove or furrow) on the neural arch of a cervical vertebra that may have been due to an injury or crushing, and two pits on the right humerus that may have been abscesses (collections of pus) or artifacts. Welles also noted that it had a smaller and more delicate left humerus than the right, but with the reverse condition in its forearms. In 2001, paleontologist Ralph Molnar suggested that this was caused by a developmental anomaly called fluctuating asymmetry. This anomaly can be caused by stress in animal populations, for example due to disturbances in their environment, and may indicate more intense selective pressure. Asymmetry can also result from traumatic events in early development of an animal, which would be more randomly distributed in time. A 2001 study conducted by paleontologist Bruce Rothschild and colleagues examined 60 &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; foot bones for signs of stress fractures (which are caused by strenuous, repetitive actions), but none were found. Such injuries can be the result of very active, predatory lifestyles.

In 2016 Senter and Sara L. Juengst examined the paleopathologies of the holotype specimen and found that it bore the greatest and most varied number of such maladies on the pectoral girdle and forelimb of any theropod dinosaur so far described, some of which are not known from any other dinosaur. Only six other theropods are known with more than one paleopathology on the pectoral girdle and forelimbs. The holotype specimen had eight afflicted bones, whereas no other theropod specimen is known with more than four. On its left side, it had a fractured scapula and radius, and fibriscesses (like abscesses) in the ulna and the outer phalanx bone of the thumb. On the right side it had torsion of its humeral shaft, three bony tumors on its radius, a truncated articular surface of its third metacarpal bone, and deformities on the first phalanx bone of the third finger. This finger was permanently deformed and unable to flex. The deformities of the humerus and the third finger may have been due to osteodysplasia, which had not been reported from non-avian dinosaurs before, but is known in birds. Affecting juvenile birds that have experienced malnutrition, this disease can cause pain in one limb, which makes the birds prefer to use the other limb instead, which thereby develops torsion.
The number of traumatic events that led to these features is not certain, and it is possible that they were all caused by a single encounter, for example by crashing into a tree or rock during a fight with another animal, which may have caused puncture wounds with its claws. Since all the injuries had healed, it is certain that the &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; survived for a long time after these events, for months, perhaps years. The use of the forelimbs for prey capture must have been compromised during the healing process. The dinosaur may therefore have endured a long period of fasting or subsisted on prey that was small enough for it to dispatch with the mouth and feet, or with one forelimb.

According to Senter and Juengst, the high degree of pain the dinosaur might have experienced in multiple locations for long durations also shows that it was a hardy animal. They noted that paleopathologies in dinosaurs are underreported, and that even though Welles had thoroughly described the holotype, he had mentioned only one of the pathologies found by them. They suggested that such features may sometimes be omitted because descriptions of species are concerned with their characteristics rather than abnormalities, or because such features are difficult to recognize. Senter and Sullivan found that the pathologies significantly altered the range of motion in the right shoulder and right third finger of the holotype, and that estimates for range of motion may therefore not match those made for a healthy forelimb.

==Paleoenvironment==
&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; is known from the Kayenta Formation, which dates to the Sinemurian-Toarcian stages of the Early Jurassic, approximately 196–186 million years ago (187–190 mya has also been suggested, and the age of the Kayenta is considered complex). As &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; is known from the base to the middle of the formation, which is Pliensbachian in age, the taxon had a chronostratigraphic range of 15 million years. The Kayenta Formation is part of the Glen Canyon Group that includes formations in northern Arizona, parts of southeastern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. It is composed mostly of two facies, one dominated by siltstone deposition and the other by sandstone. The siltstone facies is found in much of Arizona, while the sandstone facies is present in areas of northern Arizona, southern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. The formation was primarily deposited by rivers, with the siltstone facies as the slower, more sluggish part of the river system. Kayenta Formation deposition was ended by the encroaching dune field that would become the Navajo Sandstone. The environment was seasonally dry, with sand dunes migrating in and out of the wet environments where animals lived, and has been likened to a river oasis; a waterway lined with conifers and surrounded by sand. 

The Kayenta Formation has yielded a small but growing assemblage of organisms. Most fossils are from the siltstone facies. Most organisms known so far are vertebrates. Non-vertebrates include microbial or &quot;algal&quot; limestone, petrified wood, plant impressions, freshwater bivalves and snails, ostracods, and invertebrate trace fossils. Vertebrates are known from both body fossils and trace fossils. Vertebrates known from body fossils include hybodont sharks, indeterminate bony fish, lungfish, salamanders, the frog &quot;Prosalirus&quot;, the caecilian &quot;Eocaecilia&quot;, the turtle &quot;Kayentachelys&quot;, a sphenodontian reptile, lizards, and several early crocodylomorphs including &quot;Calsoyasuchus&quot;, &quot;Eopneumatosuchus&quot;, &quot;Kayentasuchus&quot;, and &quot;Protosuchus&quot;, and the pterosaur &quot;Rhamphinion&quot;. Apart from &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, several dinosaurs are known, including the theropods &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Kayentavenator&quot;, the sauropodomorph &quot;Sarahsaurus&quot;, a heterodontosaurid, and the thyreophoran &quot;Scutellosaurus&quot;. Synapsids include the tritylodontids &quot;Dinnebitodon&quot;, &quot;Kayentatherium&quot;, and &quot;Oligokyphus&quot;, morganucodontids, the possible early true mammal &quot;Dinnetherium&quot;, and a haramiyid mammal. The majority of these finds come from the vicinity of Gold Spring, Arizona. Vertebrate trace fossils include coprolites and the tracks of therapsids, lizard-like animals, and several types of dinosaur.

===Taphonomy===
Welles outlined the taphonomy of the original specimens, changes that happened during their decay and fossilization. The holotype skeleton was found lying on its right side, and its head and neck were recurvedcurved backwardsin the &quot;death pose&quot; in which dinosaur skeletons are often found. This pose was thought to be opisthotonus (due to death-spasms) at the time, but may instead have been the result of how a carcass was embedded in sediments. The back was straight, and the hindmost dorsal vertebrae were turned on their left sides. The caudal vertebrae extended irregularly from the pelvis, and the legs were articulated, with little displacement. Welles concluded that the specimens were buried at the place of their deaths, without having been transported much, but that the holotype specimen appears to have been disturbed by scavengers, indicated by the rotated dorsal vertebrae and crushed skull. Gay noted that the specimens he described in 2001 showed evidence of having been transported by a stream. As none of the specimens were complete, they may have been transported over some distance, or have lain on the surface and weathered for some time before transport. They may have been transported by a flood, as indicated by the variety of animals found as fragments and bone breakage.

==Cultural significance==

According to Navajo myth, the carcasses of slain monsters were &quot;beaten into the earth&quot;, but were impossible to obliterate, and fossils have traditionally been interpreted as their remains. While Navajo people have helped paleontologists locate fossils since the 19th century, traditional beliefs suggest that the ghosts of the monsters remain in their partially buried corpses, and have to be kept there through potent rituals. Likewise, some worry that the bones of their relatives would be dug up along with dinosaur remains, and that removing fossils shows disrespect to the past lives of these beings. In 2005, the historian Adrienne Mayor stated Welles had noted that during the original excavation of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, the Navajo Williams disappeared from the excavation after some days, and speculated this was because Williams found the detailed work with fine brushes &quot;beneath his dignity&quot;. Mayor instead pointed out that Navajo men do occupy themselves with detailed work, such as jewellery and painting, and that the explanation for Williams&#x27; departure may instead have been traditional anxiety as the skeletons emerged and were disturbed. Mayor also pointed to an incident in the 1940s when a Navajo man helped excavate a &quot;Pentaceratops&quot; skeleton as long as he did not have to touch the bones, but left the site when only a few inches of dirt were left covering them. In a 1994 book, Welles said Williams had come back some days later with two Navajo women saying &quot;that&#x27;s no man&#x27;s work, that&#x27;s squaw&#x27;s work&quot;.

The cliffs in Arizona that contained the bones of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; also have petroglyphs by ancestral Puebloans carved onto them, and the criss-crossing tracks of the area are called &quot;Naasho&#x27;illbahitsho Biikee&quot; by the Navajo, meaning &quot;big lizard tracks&quot;. According to Mayor, Navajos used to hold ceremonies and make offerings to these monster tracks. Tridactyl tracks were also featured as decorations on the costumes and rock art of the Hopi and Zuni, probably influenced by such dinosaur tracks. In 2017 &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was designated as the state dinosaur of the US state of Connecticut, to become official with the new state budget in 2019. &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was chosen because tracks thought to have been made by similar dinosaurs were discovered in Rocky Hill in 1966, during excavation for the Interstate Highway 91. The six tracks were assigned to the ichnospecies &quot;Eubrontes giganteus&quot;, which was made the state fossil of Connecticut in 1991. The area they were found in had been a Triassic lake, and when the significance of the area was confirmed, the highway was rerouted, and the area made a state park named Dinosaur State Park. In 1981 a sculpture of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, the first life-sized reconstruction of this dinosaur, was donated to the park.

&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was proposed as the state dinosaur of Arizona by a nine-year-old boy in 1998, but lawmakers suggested &quot;Sonorasaurus&quot; instead, arguing that &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was not unique to Arizona. A compromise was suggested that would recognize both dinosaurs, but the bill died when it was revealed that the &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; fossils had been taken without permission from the Navajo Reservation, and because they did not reside in Arizona anymore (an 11-year-old boy again suggested &quot;Sonorasaurus&quot; as Arizona&#x27;s state dinosaur in 2018). Navajo Nation officials subsequently discussed how to get the fossils returned. According to Mayor, one Navajo stated that they do not ask to get the fossils back anymore, but wondered why casts had not been made so the bones could be left, as it would be better to keep them in the ground, and a museum built so people could come to see them there. Further field work related to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; in the Navajo Nation was conducted with permission from the Navajo Nation Minerals Department.

===&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;===
&quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was featured in the 1990 novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, by the writer Michael Crichton, and its 1993 movie adaptation by the director Steven Spielberg. The &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was acknowledged as the &quot;only serious departure from scientific veracity&quot; in the movie&#x27;s making-of book, and as the &quot;most fictionalized&quot; of the movie&#x27;s dinosaurs in a book about Stan Winston Studios, which created the animatronics effects. For the novel, Crichton invented the dinosaur&#x27;s ability to spit venom (explaining how it was able to kill prey, in spite of its seemingly weak jaws). The art department added another feature, a neck frill or cowl folded against its neck that expanded and vibrated as the animal prepared to attack, similar to that of the frill-necked lizard. To avoid confusion with the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; as featured in the movie, &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was presented as only tall, instead of its assumed true height of about . Nicknamed &quot;the spitter&quot;, the &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; of the movie was realized through puppeteering, and required a full body with three interchangeable heads to produce the actions required by the script. Separate legs were also constructed for a shot where the dinosaur hops by. Unlike most of the other dinosaurs in the movie, no computer-generated imagery was employed when showing the &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;.

The geologist J. Bret Bennington noted in 1996 that though &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; probably did not have a frill and could not spit venom like in the movie, its bite could have been venomous, as has been claimed for the Komodo dragon. He found that adding venom to the dinosaur was no less allowable than giving a color to its skin, which is also unknown. If the dinosaur had a frill, there would have been evidence for this in the bones, in the shape of a rigid structure to hold up the frill, or markings at the places where the muscles used to move it were attached. He also added that if it did have a frill, it would not have used it to intimidate its meal, but rather a competitor (he speculated it may have responded to a character in the movie pulling a hood over his head). In a 1997 review of a book about the science of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, the paleontologist Peter Dodson likewise pointed out the wrong scale of the film&#x27;s &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, as well as the improbability of its venom and frill. Bakker pointed out in 2014 that the movie&#x27;s &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; lacked the prominent notch in the upper jaw, and concluded that the movie-makers had done a good job at creating a frightening chimaera of different animals, but warned it could not be used to teach about the real animal. Brown and Marsh stated that while these traits were fictitious, they were made believable by being based on the biology of real animals. Welles himself was &quot;thrilled&quot; to see &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;: he noted the inaccuracies, but found them minor points, enjoyed the movie, and was happy to find the dinosaur &quot;an internationally known actor&quot;.

<doc id="444550" wikidata="Q917579" url="?curid=444550" title="Flyball">
<text>Flyball is a dog sport in which teams of dogs race against each other from the start to the finish line, over a line of hurdles, to a box that releases a tennis ball to be caught when the dog presses the spring-loaded pad, then back to their handlers while carrying the ball.

Flyball is run in teams of four dogs, as a relay. The course consists of four hurdles placed apart from each other, with the starting line from the first hurdle, and the flyball box after the last one, making for a length. The hurdle height is determined by the ulna&#x27;s length or the smallest dog&#x27;s shoulder height on the team (depending on the association). For example, under current North American Flyball Association (NAFA) rules, this should be below the withers height of the smallest dog, to a height of no less than and no greater than .

United Kingdom Flyball League (UKFL) uses a patented ulna measuring device, measuring the distance between the &#x27;elbow&#x27; and bone of the stopper pad with a minimum height of and a maximum of . Current EFC (European Flyball Championship) rules limit the height to no less than 17.5 cm and no greater than 35 cm. Each dog must return its ball all the way across the start line before the next dog crosses. Ideal running is nose-to-nose at the start line. The first team to have all four dogs cross the finish line error free wins the heat. Penalties are applied to teams if the ball is dropped or if the next relay dog is released early.

== History ==

Flyball started as a dog sport in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Southern California. Some dog trainers combined scent hurdle racing with the dogs bringing back a tennis ball to the finish line. Then a tennis ball-launching apparatus was added, and the first flyball box was born. Herbert Wagner is credited with making the first real flyball box, and he also demonstrated flyball on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

The first flyball tournament was held in 1983 in the United States.

Flyball has now expanded into many countries, including Australia, Canada and South Africa, and in European countries such as Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Hungary, France and the United Kingdom have national flyball tournaments and also hold joint annual European championships.

The European championships, which are the largest international Flyball championships, were held in the United Kingdom in 2007 and 2012, the Czech Republic in 2008; Poland in 2018; Belgium in 2009, 2010 and 2013; Germany in 2011, 2015 and 2019; and France in 2014.

== Nature of the sport ==

Flyball provides an entertaining and active way to interact with one&#x27;s dog and other dog enthusiasts in an enjoyable environment while allowing the dogs exercise and enjoyment. It is an especially effective way to burn off dogs&#x27; energy with a high drive to work, such as Border Collies and Staffordshire Bull Terriers.

A large part of flyball&#x27;s popularity stems from the fact that it is one of the competition activities available to mixed-breed dogs, allowing rescued mutts and non-pedigree dogs to shine alongside their purebred canine counterparts. Though herding dogs currently dominate the courses, many champion teams have mutts on them. Dogs earn titles and awards based on points earned by their team in racing.

As the sport has developed, better dog training regimes have been introduced as knowledge has increased within the sport. Specific training has been developed to promote the dogs using the &#x27;swimmers&#x27; type turns on the Flyball box when catching the ball and turning.

Flyball is not limited to the breed&#x27;s size, as smaller dogs such as Patterdale Terriers, Jack Russell Terriers, Whippets and even miniature poodles, often compete with great success in mixed-breed teams (teams consisting of dogs of various sizes and breeds). Smaller dogs are often prized as the hurdle height is based on the height of the smallest dog in the team, commonly known as a &quot;height dog&quot;. Their only limitation is whether they can trigger the release pad, and small dogs often have to fully jump on it to do so.

Flyball is one of the non-hunting dog sports in which dogs and people work as a team. Many casual pet owners use their flyball time more as a way to relax and socialize with other dog owners than as a competition, and many champion flyball dogs are essentially pet dogs with a hobby, rather than dedicated sporting or working dogs. On the other hand, modern flyball has become the fastest-growing team sport, a sport for dogs, handlers and coaches. First division teams have well-trained dogs and handlers and are trained and coached to perform. Some teams use dedicated specially bred sport dogs.
==Competitions==

Competitions are usually hosted by a specific local flyball club but under the sanction of a national governing body. The host club may be devoted solely to flyball or to many other types of dog sports. The host flyball club uses Head judges who are licensed by the national sanctioning organization and the club will apply to the national sanctioning organization for permission to hold a competition on a specific date or weekend; most competitions are two-day weekend events.

Although competitions may vary, teams are normally seeded into divisions against other teams of similar speed. This allows the races to be closer and much more exciting. Each team in the division will usually race against all the other teams in a round robin format. The overall winner is the team with the most wins in a race.

In competitions all teams will also be trying to improve their own individual team&#x27;s best race time. Teams that underestimate their speed may &quot;break out&quot; of their division in competition. The break-out time for a division is typically set at 1 second faster than the top seeded team in each division. The break-out rule is intended to encourage teams to seed themselves accurately, as any heats where a team breaks out do not count and are recorded as losses.

The largest single regularly held flyball competition is the North American Flyball Championships which is called the CanAm Classic. In the 2009 Championships there were about 300 teams competing held over a three-day event.

U-Fli hosts their Tournament of Champions at Purina Farms. A slightly smaller scale to NAFA&#x27;s CanAm Classic, it hosts over 100 teams and runs 3 to 4 rings of races over the course of three days.

== Technology ==
While flyball tournaments can be run manually utilizing stopwatches and line judges, electronic systems to facilitate accurate judging are the norm. NAFA refers to their system as the Electronic Judging System. U-FLI refers to their system as the Digital Scoring System.

These systems are similar in nature, with the following primary components: A light tree to indicate the countdown to race start, optical gates positioned at the start/finish line to detect line faults, and a high-precision digital clock to time the race.

=== Pass Calling ===
Flyball teams with fast dogs and tight passes run into the limits of human perception when it comes to accurate estimation of the distance between the dogs when the returning dog passes through the plane of the start/finish line.

Some teams use digital video cameras to record the pass, and then review frame-by-frame to develop an estimate of distance, but the traditional frame rate of 30 frames per second (FPS) can present a problem in that it is unlikely to capture a frame of the exact moment the returning dog breaches the plane of the start/finish line. More recently, high-speed consumer cameras such as the Casio Exilim EX-FH100 have been used to record video at much higher frame rates.

Some teams have started using software designed for other sports, such as the cSwing Golf Analysis tool, to aid in the capture and review of high speed camera footage of flyball passes.

=== Fastest recorded singles time ===

Wire (owned and trained by Jayne McQuillen) from Skidmarkz flyball team from Iowa City, Iowa, US, recorded a time of 3.386 seconds at Jefferson, Wisconsin on 2 September 2023.

Fume (owned and trained by Barbara Bunday) from Paws on the Run flyball team from Leicestershire, UK, recorded a time of 3.40 seconds, recorded at Horseley Fen 31 December 2021.

<text>The Dears are a Canadian indie rock band from Montreal, Quebec. The band is led by the husband-and-wife duo of singer-guitarist Murray Lightburn and keyboardist Natalia Yanchak.

==History==
The band formed in 1995 and released their first album, &quot;End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story&quot;, in 2000. Their orchestral, dark pop sound and dramatic live shows established The Dears as part of the then-emerging Canadian indie renaissance.

The Dears performed in Toronto in October 2001 with Sloan. In 2001 and 2002, they released the EPs &quot;Orchestral Pop Noir Romantique&quot; and &quot;Protest,&quot; respectively, as well as a collection of unreleased songs, &quot;Nor the Dahlias&quot;. In 2003 they released their second full-length album &quot;No Cities Left&quot;, and a string of shows at SXSW &#x27;04 launched their international career.

The Dears toured extensively across Canada, U.S., UK, Europe, Japan and Australia supporting the international release of &quot;No Cities Left&quot; and returned to the studio to record in 2005. &quot;Gang of Losers&quot; was released in 2006, and was well received by the press.

The Dears have had high-profile gigs as opening act for Sloan, The Tragically Hip, Keane, The Secret Machines and Morrissey, to whom Lightburn is often compared. Their music has been described as a cross between The Smiths and Serge Gainsbourg with Lightburn&#x27;s singing voice being likened to Morrissey as well as Blur&#x27;s Damon Albarn. The complexity of the music and arrangements has also been compared to Radiohead, Jethro Tull and early Genesis.

On July 10, 2007, The Dears&#x27; album &quot;Gang of Losers&quot; was named to the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. The follow-up &quot;Missiles&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on October 20 and in North America on October 21, 2008.

On February 15, 2011, The Dears released their fifth studio album, &quot;Degeneration Street&quot;. The album was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.

<doc id="444557" wikidata="Q6942074" url="?curid=444557" title="Music of Extremadura">
<text>Extremadura is a region in Spain near Portugal. Its folk music can be characterized by a melancholy sound, and Portuguese influences, as well as the predominance of the zambomba drum (similar to Brazilian cuica), which is played by pulling on a rope which is inside the drum. There is also a rich repertoire of gaita (local name for a tabor pipe) music. Popular songs include: de ronda; de bodas; de quintos; de Nochebuena. Jota is also common, here played with triangles, castanets, guitars, tambourines, accordions and zambombas.

There are few ethnomusicological recordings of Extremaduran music, with the most influential and well-known being by American researcher Alan Lomax. Lomax went to Spain in 1952-3 to avoid persecution as a Communist and found some hostility from Spanish researchers, then in a period of great political upheaval. Lomax and his assistant, Jeanette Bell, did much of their recording in secret. A research centre for Spanish folk music existed in Extremadura before the Civil War, but details of its collection appear to have been lost.

Extremadura has long been one of the poorest regions in the country. As a result, many of its people left to Latin America during the colonial era (1492-1820s), leaving a mark on Latin music.

Traditional Extremaduran dances include:
*El baile de la pata
*El perantón
*El pindongo
*El son brincao
*El son llano
*La Zajarrona

<text>Artificial Reality is a book series by Myron W. Krueger about interactive immersive environments (or virtual realities), based on video recognition techniques, that put a user in full, unencumbered contact with the digital world. He started this work in the late 1960s and is considered to be a key figure in the early innovation of virtual reality. For 16 years Krueger was creating a computer system that connected the actions of a user to the real-time response of visual and auditory displays. &quot;Artificial Reality&quot; was published in 1983 and updated in &quot;Artificial Reality II&quot; in 1991 (both published by Addison-Wesley). &quot;Artificial Reality II&quot; was to explore the concept of &#x27;Videoplace&#x27;, which is when a users body is implemented into a computer created world full of color, sound, and visuals. Whilst the first iteration of the series &quot;Artificial Reality&quot; has laid the ground work for different branches of computer-generated worlds like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Visualization is key for all artificial realities to efficiently use data; resulting in being able to utilize human sensory systems that create these artificial realities.

<doc id="444564" wikidata="Q643537" url="?curid=444564" title="Jean Titelouze">
<text>Jean (&quot;Jehan&quot;) Titelouze (c. 1562/63 – 24 October 1633) was a French Catholic priest, composer, poet and organist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. He was a canon and organist at Rouen Cathedral. His style was firmly rooted in the Renaissance vocal tradition and as such, was far removed from the distinctly French style of organ music that developed during the mid-17th century. However, his hymns and Magnificat settings are the earliest known published French organ collections, and he is regarded as the first composer of the French organ school.

==Life==
In a 1930 study, Amédée Gastoué suggested that the surname Titelouze may be of English or Irish origin (more specifically, derived from &quot;Title-House&quot;), but recently this supposition has been disproven, and &quot;Titelouze&quot; is now linked to &quot;de Toulouse&quot;. Titelouze was born in Saint-Omer in 1562/3 (his exact date of birth is unknown) and educated there; by 1585, he entered the priesthood and served as organist of the Saint-Omer Cathedral. He moved to Rouen later that year and in 1588, succeeded François Josseline as organist of the Rouen Cathedral. His work was not limited to Rouen: he also acted as organ consultant and helped with the installation and repair of important instruments in various cities.

In 1600, Titelouze invited the famous Franco-Flemish organ builder Crespin Carlier to Rouen to work on the cathedral organ. The result of this collaboration was referred to by contemporary critics as the best organ in France. This instrument and Carlier&#x27;s later work in France defined the French classical organ. Titelouze occasionally collaborated with Carlier on various instruments. In 1604, Titelouze was naturalized French (at the time, Saint-Omer, where Titelouze was born, was part of the Spanish Netherlands). In 1610, he was appointed one of the Rouen Cathedral&#x27;s canons. In 1613, he won his first award from Rouen&#x27;s literary society, the Académie des Palinods, for his poems.

The year 1623 saw publication of Titelouze&#x27;s &quot;Hymnes de l&#x27;Eglise&quot;, a collection of organ settings of various plainchant hymns to be used during the liturgy. The same year, due to health problems, Titelouze partially retired from his organist position (although he kept the post until his death). In 1626, he published a second organ collection, &quot;Le Magnificat&quot;, that contained eight Magnificat settings. In 1630, he received another award from the Académie des Palinods and was made &quot;Prince des Palinods&quot;. He died three years later.

Titelouze was a friend of Marin Mersenne, an important French music theorist, mathematician, philosopher and theologian. Seven letters survive from their correspondence, dated from 1622 to 1633. Titelouze gave Mersenne advice on &quot;L&#x27;Harmonie Universelle&quot;, published from 1634 to 1637. Although the strict polyphonic style of Titelouze&#x27;s music soon disappeared from French organ music, his influence was still felt for some time after his death. As an example, the Parisian composer and organist Nicolas Gigault included a fugue &quot;à la maniere de Titelouze&quot; (literally &quot;in Titelouze&#x27;s style&quot;) in his 1685 &quot;Livre de musique pour l&#x27;orgue&quot;. Some three hundred years later, the composer inspired one of Marcel Dupré&#x27;s organ works, &quot;Le Tombeau de Titelouze&quot;, op. 38 (1942).

==Works==
Titelouze&#x27;s surviving output comprises two collections of organ pieces. These are the first published collections of organ music in 17th century France. The first, &quot;Hymnes de l&#x27;Église pour toucher sur l&#x27;orgue, avec les fugues et recherches sur leur plain-chant&quot; (1623, 2nd edition in 1624), contains 12 hymns:
# Ad coenam (4 versets)
# Veni Creator (4 versets)
# Pange lingua (3 versets)
# Ut queant laxis (3 versets)
# Ave maris stella (4 versets)
# Conditor alme siderum (3 versets)
# A solis ortus (3 versets)
# Exsultet coelum (3 versets)
# Annue Christe (3 versets)
# Sanctorum meritis (3 versets)
# Iste confessor (3 versets)
# Urbs Jerusalem (3 versets)

Every hymn begins with a verset with a continuous &quot;cantus firmus&quot;: the hymn melody is stated in long note values in one of the voices, usually the bass, while the other voices provide contrapuntal accompaniment. Other versets are only occasionally cast in this form. More frequently the 16th century motet practice is used: the hymn melody either migrates from one voice to another, with or without imitative inserts between verses, or is treated imitatively throughout the piece. In three versets (&quot;Veni Creator&quot; 3, &quot;Ave maris stella&quot; 3, and &quot;Conditor&quot; 2) the melody in one voice is accompanied by two voices that form a canon, in two (&quot;Ave maris stella&quot; 4 and &quot;Annue Christe&quot; 3) one of the voices provides a pedal point. In most versets, counterpoints to the hymn melody engage in imitation or fore-imitation, and more often than not they are derived from the hymn melody. All of the pieces are in four voices, except the canonic versets, which use only three.

The second collection, &quot;Le Magnificat ou Cantique de la Vierge pour toucher sur l&#x27;orgue suivant les huit tons de l&#x27;Église&quot;, published in 1626, contains eight Magnificat settings in all eight church modes. There are seven versets in each setting, presenting the odd-numbered versets of the canticle, with two settings of &quot;Deposuit potentes&quot;:
#Magnificat
#Quia respexit
#Et misericordia
#Deposuit potentes, first setting
#Deposuit potentes, second setting
#Suscepit Israel
#Gloria Patri et Filio

In the preface, Titelouze explains that this structure makes these Magnificat settings usable for the &quot;Benedictus.&quot; Save for the introductory ones, all of the versets are fugal. Most feature two main points of imitation: the first concludes on the mediant cadence of the mode, and so, Titelouze writes, the organist can shorten any verset during the service by substituting this cadence with one on the final. Most fugue subjects are derived from the chant; there are many double fugues and inversion fugues in the collection. Four-voice polyphony is employed throughout the collection. The music is much more forward-looking than in the &quot;Hymnes&quot; (see &quot;Example 2&quot; for an excerpt from one of the inversion fugues).

Although French organs already had colorful solo stops at the time, Titelouze did not use them. According to the prefaces of both collections, he was concerned with making his pieces easier to play and playable by hands alone. Titelouze goes as far as suggesting, in the preface to &quot;Hymnes&quot;, to alter the music if it is too difficult to play.

<doc id="444566" wikidata="Q1544451" url="?curid=444566" title="Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program">
<text>The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) was initiated by the United States Navy after World War II to improve the submerged speed, maneuverability, and endurance of its submarines. (The &quot;Y&quot; in the acronym was added for pronounceability.)

The navy began the program by testing and reverse engineering two German Type XXI U-boats— and —obtained as war reparation. That analysis led to four goals—increasing the submarines&#x27; battery capacity, streamlining the boats&#x27; structures, adding snorkels, and improving fire control systems. The navy immediately focused on designing a new class of submarine, but the Bureau of Ships believed the fleet of existing , , and submarines could be modified to incorporate the desired improvements. In June 1946, the Chief of Naval Operations approved the GUPPY project. The initial two-boat test program, implemented by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, eventually grew into several successive conversion programs. Those upgrades proceeded in seven variants, in the following order: GUPPY I, GUPPY II, GUPPY IA, Fleet Snorkel, GUPPY IIA, GUPPY IB, and GUPPY III. Some boats that went through an early phase were then upgraded further in a later phase. Most GUPPY phases were assigned a corresponding Ship Characteristics Board / SCB project number.

A similar program for the Royal Navy involved modifications to 24 wartime and post-war British T- and A-class submarines, which were provided with streamlined hulls, fin-type conning towers, and increased underwater performance during 1948–60.

== GUPPY I program ==

The prototype GUPPYs, and (both Portsmouth-built &quot;Tench&quot; boats), appeared in 1947. Externally, they featured improved streamlining of the bridge and shears structures, and periscope and radar mast supports. To reduce hydrodynamic drag, one of the periscopes was deleted. No snorkel was fitted, due to difficulties in adapting the snorkel to the fleet boat. Deck guns and their associated containers were removed. An SV radar aerial was added to the top of the sail, creating a distinctive side bulge. All capstans, cleats, and rail stanchion supports were redesigned so they could be retracted or removed when rigged for dive. Most notably, the sharp -shaped &quot;fleet boat bow&quot; was replaced with a distinctive rounded &quot;Guppy bow&quot; that improved submerged performance.

These modifications changed not only the boats&#x27; appearance, but also their terminology: After a GUPPY conversion, the faired structure around the boat&#x27;s conning tower and mast supports was called the &quot;sail&quot;.

Internally, the boats underwent considerable rearrangement to accommodate larger battery wells and batteries of greatly increased electrical power. The batteries were of a new design. Compared with the original battery, the Guppy battery used a greater number of thinner plates that would generate higher current for a longer time. However, these batteries had a shorter life, 18 months versus the five years of the &quot;Sargo&quot; battery, and took longer to charge. They also required ventilation to remove hydrogen gas, and required cooling water to the battery terminals and termination bars. Four 126-cell batteries were installed in enlarged battery wells that replaced former storage, ammunition, and refrigeration spaces. These four batteries could be connected in series or parallel, providing a wide range of voltages and currents, and thus a wide range of speeds.

In the maneuvering room, two or four of the earlier high-speed motors and reduction gears were replaced by slow-speed motors. All open-front switchboards were replaced with enclosed splash-proof cabinets. Lighting and other &quot;hotel&quot; electrical loads were converted to use 120 volt 60 hertz alternating current, and ship electronics to use 120 volt 400 hertz AC. A new air conditioning system of greatly increased capacity was also installed.

In service, these boats offered greatly improved underwater performance. &quot;Pomodon&quot; reached surfaced and submerged as compared to the previous performance of surfaced and submerged, &quot;Odax&quot; slightly less.

== GUPPY II program ==

The GUPPY II conversion (SCB 47), implemented from 1947 to 1951, was generally similar to the GUPPY I, except for retention of both periscopes and introduction of the recently perfected snorkel. The addition of three new masts—snorkel induction, snorkel exhaust, and ESM mast—required more room in the upper portion of the sail. BuShips approved two different sail designs:

* The &quot;Electric Boat Sail&quot; had a straight trailing edge, round windows, a wider top and a more rounded forward edge.
* The &quot;Portsmouth Sail&quot; had a thinner top, curved trailing edge, square windows and a sharper lower forward edge. It was put on all boats that used the government plans for the conversion.

Some boats with a Portsmouth Sail had an SV radar and needed extra room to house the aerial, thus had a bulge at the sail top. Later modifications put the SS or SS2 radars on these and other boats that had a smaller aerial and had an indicator with interlocks, allowing the mast to be housed only with the aerial in certain angular positions. Also, some GUPPY II and GUPPY III boats had their sails extended higher above the waterline, the &quot;Northern Sail&quot;, to raise the bridge, allowing it to be manned in more severe weather.

All boats converted during the GUPPY II program that originally had high-speed drive motors with reduction gears had these replaced with low-speed direct-drive motors, producing 2500 horsepower (1.9 MW) per shaft.

The two GUPPY I boats, &quot;Odax&quot; and &quot;Pomodon&quot;, were modified to GUPPY II standard.

== GUPPY IA program ==
BuShips devised the GUPPY IA (SCB 47A) program of 1951 as a cheaper alternative to the GUPPY II conversion. While the GUPPY IA conversion included most features of the GUPPY II, it omitted the four-well battery configuration and extensive internal rearrangement associated with it. Instead, the GUPPY IA retained the original battery wells, fitted with four more powerful Sargo II batteries. The Sargo II was developed to be lower cost than the Guppy battery while providing most of the performance. It was intermediate in size between the Guppy and &quot;Sargo&quot; batteries. These batteries featured electrolyte agitation, battery cooling, and open tank ventilation. They also had a longer life than the Guppy batteries, though shorter than the original &quot;Sargo&quot; battery. The sonar room was relocated from the forward torpedo room to a space under the galley. Compared to the GUPPY II, the GUPPY IA offered lower cost, better habitability, and easier maintenance at the expense of underwater performance.

== Fleet Snorkel Program ==
When the navy realized that it would not be able to fund all the GUPPY conversions it desired, it devised the Fleet Snorkel Program (SCB 47B) as a means of adding the minimum necessary modifications to fleet boats. This modernization added a snorkel, a streamlined sail, a higher capacity air-conditioning system, and a more powerful electrical system. The deck guns and auxiliary diesel were removed. Unlike the GUPPY conversions, these boats retained their original deck structure, bow, and storage batteries. Submerged performance of the Fleet Snorkel boats was therefore significantly inferior to any GUPPY conversion. Despite their limited features, the Fleet Snorkel boats served almost as long as the more modern GUPPY boats. Three boats, &quot;Piper&quot;, &quot;Sea Owl&quot;, and &quot;Sterlet&quot;, received a large BQR-4A bow sonar. The ex-USS &quot;Chub&quot;) and ex-USS &quot;Brill&quot;, both transferred to Turkey in 1948 as TCG &quot;Gür&quot; and TCG 1. &quot;İnönü&quot;, were converted to a Fleet Snorkel Submarine in 1953, the work being done first in Turkey&#x27;s Gölcük Navy Yard and completed in the United States.

== GUPPY IIA program ==
The GUPPY IA program was succeeded by the nearly identical GUPPY IIA program (SCB 47C), implemented from 1952 to 1954. The GUPPY IIA, however, further alleviated the cramped internal conditions of earlier conversions by removing one forward engine and replacing it with pumps and air conditioning machinery. Some boats had the high-pressure air compressors relocated to the lower level of the forward engine room. The freezer and refrigerator units were moved to the space under the galley, and the sonar room was relocated to the forward end of the pump room. Sargo II batteries were installed in the existing battery wells.

Externally, the GUPPY IIA differed from the GUPPY II and IA by having only three diesel exhaust outlets, whereas the earlier conversions had four.

== GUPPY IB program ==
GUPPY IB was an informal designation for a limited upgrade and modernization given to four boats for transfer to foreign navies. These boats had snorkels and were generally similar to the GUPPY IA, except that they were not equipped with the modern sonar, fire control systems, or ESM. The two Italian boats were of the thin-skinned &quot;Gato&quot; class. The two Dutch boats formed together the &quot;Walrus&quot; class.

== GUPPY III program ==
The GUPPY II conversions suffered from very cramped internal conditions due to the four-battery configuration. The GUPPY III program (SCB 223) was devised to address this problem. In 1959, &quot;Tiru&quot; became the prototype conversion. It was cut in half and lengthened with a section forward of the control room to create space for a new sonar room, berthing, electronics, and storerooms. The removal of the sonar room from the forward torpedo spaces allowed an increase in the number of reloads. Crew spaces were also refurbished. As in the GUPPY IIA conversion, one diesel engine was removed. The tall sail (or &quot;North Atlantic Sail&quot;, as they were sometimes called) was a singular characteristic of the GUPPY III boats, distinct from the so-called &quot;step sail&quot; of all of the other GUPPY submarine classes.

From 1961 to 1963, eight more GUPPY II boats were upgraded to GUPPY III standard. These boats differed from &quot;Tiru&quot; by adding a section forward of the control room. They also retained all four diesel engines. This increased the boat&#x27;s length to and raised surfaced displacement to approximately 1,975 tons.

All boats received the BQG-4 PUFFS passive ranging sonar, identifiable by the three shark fin-like sonar domes added to the topside superstructure. The conning tower in the sail gained an additional section to accommodate the Mk 101 fire control system and Mk 37 director. All GUPPY III boats received a plastic sail.

The fire control upgrades allowed GUPPY III submarines to fire the Mark 45 nuclear torpedo.

The GUPPY III conversion was part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. All 24 GUPPY II boats were originally slated to receive the GUPPY III upgrade, but budgetary constraints limited the program to a total of nine boats. Despite their extensive modifications and upgrades, the GUPPY III boats served only slightly longer than the rest of the GUPPY fleet.

<doc id="444575" wikidata="Q6942354" url="?curid=444575" title="Music of the Canary Islands">
<text>The music of the [[Canary Islands]] reflects its cultural heritage. The islands used to be inhabited by the Guanches which are related to Berbers; they mixed with Spaniards, who live on the islands now. A variant of Jota is popular, as is Latin music, which has left its mark in the form of the timple guitar.
There has been a strong connection with Cuban music, Venezuelan, Puerto Rican, and other Caribbean countries both through commerce and migration.

Popular dances from the Canary Islands include:
* Isas
* Tajaraste
** It probably inspired the Canary dance which became popular all over Europe in the late 16th and early 17th century.
* Baile del Candil
* Baile de Cintas
* Danza de Enanos
* El Santo Domingo
* Tanganillo
* Folias
* Malagueña

Of these, the Isas, a local variation of Jota, are the best-known and most characteristic of the Canary Islands. They are graceful music, with much variation between islands. In some places, a &quot;captain&quot; leads the dance and organizes others in a chain as the dance grows more and more complex.

Rondalla arrangements are very common. Instruments include charangas, timples (similar to a cavaquinho / ukulele), castanets, panderetas, lauds and guitars. A peculiar ensemble in El Hierro island is made of pito herreño players (a wooden transverse flute) and drums. Some ritual dances in Tenerife island are led by a tabor pipe player. Joyful music for carnival lies to a big extent on brass bands and Latin American patterns.

The chácaras are a type of castanets used in the Canary Islands of La Gomera and El Hierro.

==Canary musicians==
* Pedro Guerra
* Rosana

<doc id="444581" wikidata="Q7406328" url="?curid=444581" title="Salute Your Shorts">
<text>Salute Your Shorts is an American television sitcom created by Steve Slavkin and produced by Propaganda Films, which aired on Nickelodeon from July 4, 1991, to September 12, 1992.

Focused around the life of young campers at the fictional Camp Anawanna, the show was based on Slavkin&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;Salute Your Shorts: Life at Summer Camp&quot; that he co-wrote with Thomas Hill.

Despite its short run and limited availability on home media, the show was consistently one of the highest-rated cable programs.

==Premise==

The series is set at the fictional summer camp, Camp Anawanna (a play on the exclamation &quot;I don&#x27;t want to&quot;). It focuses on teenage campers, their strict and bossy counselor, and the various capers and jocularities they engage in.

The first season focused on the power struggle between upstanding newcomer Michael Stein (Erik MacArthur) and camp bully Bobby Budnick (Danny Cooksey). Ronnie Pinsky (Blake Soper) replaced Michael in the second season, countering Budnick as a suave, preppie ladies-man. Other campers included Budnick&#x27;s accomplice Eddie &quot;Donkey Lips&quot; Gelfand (Michael Bower), nerdy Sponge Harris (Tim Eyster), stuck-up rich girl Dina Alexander (Heidi Lucas), tomboy Telly Radford (Venus DeMilo Thomas), and nature-loving Z.Z. Ziff (Megan Berwick).

Kevin &quot;Ug&quot; Lee (Kirk Baily), the dim-witted camp counselor, served as antagonist to all the children. Dr. Kahn (Steve Slavkin), the unseen camp director, was heard providing announcements over the public address system. Mona Tibbs (Christine Cavanaugh) made recurring appearances as Ug&#x27;s love interest.

The title of the show comes from a common prank campers play on each other: a group of children steal a boy&#x27;s boxer shorts and raise them up a flagpole. Hence, when people see them waving like a flag, other children salute them as part of the prank. In the first episode of the series, Michael falls victim to this prank.

==Episodes==

==Production==
Steve Slavkin was commissioned by Nickelodeon to write a television pilot based on his 1986 book &quot;Salute Your Shorts: Life at Summer Camp&quot; that he co-wrote with Thomas Hill. 

Nickelodeon was under pressure in 1990 to create original programming that could compete with The Disney Afternoon, while also shedding its image as &quot;the game show network&quot;. &quot;Double Dare&quot; had been a major success for the network since its premiere in 1986, but the channel lacked in-house narrative programming and in-house animation. &quot;Camp Candy&quot; launched on NBC in 1989 and showed there was an audience for children&#x27;s programming about summer camp.

Randall Miller directed the pilot episode of the series, which was filmed at Griffith Park Boys Camp in March 1990. It starred Ian Giatti as Michael, Danny Cooksey as Budnick, Kirk Baily as Ug, Michael Bower as Donkey Lips, David Tom as Sponge, Teri Johnston as Dina, Alexandra Kurhan as Telly, and Kelley Parker as Z.Z. Miller had previously directed Bower, Johnston and Parker in his short-film &quot;Marilyn Hotchkiss&#x27; Ballroom Dancing and Charm School&quot;. The pilot aired Saturday, October 6, 1990, at 5:30pm EST on Nickelodeon as the television special &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot;.

The show was re-cast after being picked up to series in February 1991, as many of the young actors had outgrown their roles since the pilot was filmed. The only cast members retained from the pilot were Cooksey, Baily and Bower. Bower&#x27;s character of Donkey Lips was the antagonist of the pilot, with Cooksey playing his sidekick Budnick. Their roles were reversed for the series after Cooksey had grown taller than Bower.

Filming of the first season&#x27;s initial order of 6 episodes took place in April and May 1991. The series was allotted $180,000 per episode, which was considered low-budget. Interiors for the show were filmed inside a soundstage on Lankershim Boulevard in Sun Valley. Exteriors were filmed at Franklin Canyon Park and the Griffith Park Boys Camp. Some exterior shots of the bunks were done using three-foot high miniatures.

The show&#x27;s music was composed by Ed Alton, who had previously composed the music for &quot;Head of the Class&quot;. The opening theme song was a mock Camp Anawanna alma mater composed by Alton, with lyrics by Slavkin. The cast sang the opening theme live over a pre-recorded track of Alton playing the piano.

The first season premiered with a special primetime broadcast on Thursday, July 4, 1991 (Independence Day), with new episodes airing Saturdays at 5:30pm EST thereafter. Filming for the remaining 7 episodes of the first season took place in August and September 1991. The series was renewed for a 13-episode second season in October 1991.

Cast members were flown to Orlando for promotional appearances at Nickelodeon Studios in December 1991. Cooksey and Bower defeated Heidi Lucas and Megan Berwick on an episode of &quot;Nick Arcade&quot;. Baily also joined Berwick, Bower, Cooksey and Lucas for an outdoor autograph signing. Cooksey has said this trip is when he realized how popular the series had become, with fans singing the show&#x27;s theme song upon seeing the cast.

Erik MacArthur left the show just before second season filming began in April 1992, so his character of Michael was written out and replaced with Blake Soper as Pinsky. Soper was scheduled to play Scotty Rex in the episode &quot;Telly and the Tennis Match&quot; before producers asked him to join the series full-time.

Slavkin walked out of filming to protest Nickelodeon denying the cast raises for potential third and fourth seasons. Nickelodeon was infamous for underpaying its child actors, with Ryan Reynolds admitting the network only paid him $150 per episode while starring in &quot;Fifteen&quot;. Slavkin never returned, and the final two weeks of second season filming were completed without him.

The second season premiered with a special primetime broadcast on Friday, June 26, 1992, with new episodes airing Saturdays at 6:00pm EST thereafter.

The series was not renewed for a third season after the network wanted production moved to Nickelodeon Studios, but most of the cast was unwilling to relocate from Los Angeles to Orlando. Nickelodeon was under pressure by parent company Viacom to reduce its budget so that MTV could fund production of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical===

&quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; holds a 75% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating among critics on Rotten Tomatoes.

Craig Tomashoff of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the series premiere a rating of B+, comparing it favorably to &quot;Meatballs&quot;.

Lynn Heffley of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the series premiere as, &quot;...a general celebration of crudity, stupidity and irrelevance.&quot;

The Twizard ranked the first season episode &quot;The Clinic&quot; as the best of the series, further explaining that the episode, &quot;...breaks down the psychology of Budnick&#x27;s aggression and shows him at his most vulnerable&quot;.

Randall Colburn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised the second season addition of Blake Soper as Pinsky, arguing that while he was not a clear protagonist like Michael was during the first season, his neutrality strengthened the ensemble.

===Awards===

The show was nominated for Outstanding Young Ensemble Cast in a Television Series at the 13th Youth in Film Awards on December 1, 1991.

At the 14th Youth in Film Awards on January 16, 1993, seveal cast members were honoured: Heidi Lucas won Best Young Actress Co-Starring in a Cable Series, beating fellow cast members Megan Berwick and Venus DeMilo, who were also nominated; Michael Bower won Best Young Actor Co-Starring in a Cable Series, beating castmate Trevor Eyster, who was also nominated; and Danny Cooksey was nominated for Best Young Actor Starring in a Cable Series.

===Ratings===

The show was the second highest-rated cable television series with children aged 6–11 at the start of its second season in 1992.

Despite being in reruns for four years, the show finished as one of the 15 highest-rated basic cable series of 1996.

The show last aired on Nickelodeon on June 7, 2004, after winning a fan vote as part of the network&#x27;s 25th-anniversary U-Pick Live programming.

==Cultural impact==
Paley Center for Media has preserved the first season episode &quot;Sponge Saga&quot; in its New York archive. The museum curates select television programming for its, &quot;artistic achievement, social impact, or historic significance&quot;.

Danny Cooksey recorded the album &quot;Refugee&quot; with his band Bad4Good during filming of the second season in 1992. The song &quot;Devil in the Angel&quot; was written by Cooksey and Steve Vai for the two-part episode &quot;Budnick and Dina in Love&quot;, but was left out of the show due to time constraints. Blake Soper and Michael Bower sang backing vocals on the album.

Following the show&#x27;s cancellation, NBC offered Steve Slavkin the opportunity to write and produce &quot;Running the Halls&quot;, which aired as part of their Saturday Morning TNBC block in 1993. Ed Alton composed the show&#x27;s music, Randall Miller served as director, and Michael Bower guest starred in &quot;The Big Kiss&quot;.

Blake Soper wrote and performed the song &quot;Spectacular Views (Salute My Shorts!)&quot; with his band Rilo Kiley, which was featured as a hidden track on the vinyl release of &quot;Take Offs and Landings&quot; in 2001. Cooksey sang backing vocals on the album.

Awful Waffle is a ska punk band that was formed in Brick Township, New Jersey, in 2006. That same year, professional wrestler Chuck Taylor innovated a piledriver called the Awful Waffle as his finishing move. Both are references to a prank of the same name from the first season episode &quot;First Day&quot;.

Cooksey reprised his role of Budnick in 2007 for the &quot;All My Friends&quot; music video, which was the first single from &quot;A Few More Published Studies&quot; by The XYZ Affair. Jason Zimbler (&quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;), Marc Summers (&quot;Double Dare&quot;) and Michael Maronna (&quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;) co-starred in the video.

The show&#x27;s theme song was sampled in the track &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; on the 2009 album &quot;Snick @ Nite&quot; by Curtiss King.

&quot;Anawanna Blues&quot; is a song referencing the show and its characters from the 2012 album &quot;This American Way of Life&quot; by The Downrights.

Cooksey, Bower, Slavkin and Venus DeMilo were featured in the 2018 documentary &quot;The Orange Years&quot;, sharing their experiences on the show and exploring its place in Nickelodeon history.

&quot;American Dad!&quot; referenced the series in the title of their 2020 episode &quot;Salute Your Sllort&quot;.

A retrospective documentary about the series titled &quot;Forever Anawanna&quot; is in production, and will feature new interviews with the original cast and crew.

==Reunions==
Members of the cast and crew reunited on September 15, 2012, for a Comikaze Expo panel at Los Angeles Convention Center. In attendance were Andrea Sherman (script supervisor), Danny Cooksey, Ed Alton (composer), Erik MacArthur, Kirk Baily, Larry Shapiro (associate producer), Michael Bower, Steve Slavkin, Tim Eyster and Venus DeMilo. Megan Berwick did not attend but sent a video message.

A 25th-anniversary reunion occurred on May 28, 2015, during Everything Is Festival at Hollywood Theatre. In attendance were MacArthur, Heidi Lucas, Baily, Berwick, Bower, Slavkin, Eyster and DeMilo. Cooksey did not attend as he was recording an album with the band Shelter Dogs.

Cooksey and Slavkin appeared on June 9, 2017, as part of the NickSplat panel at ATX Television Festival.

Members of the cast reunited on August 20, 2019, for a &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; trivia night at Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Good Burger&quot; pop-up restaurant in Los Angeles. In attendance were Cooksey, Baily, Berwick, Bower, Slavkin and DeMilo.

Bower and DeMilo appeared on October 12, 2019, as part of the L.A. Comic Con after party at Globe Theatre. They performed the &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; theme song onstage with The Flux Capacitors.

==Distribution==

Reruns of the show continued airing regularly on Nickelodeon from 1993 to 1999.

The series was never released into syndication, but has aired on other Nickelodeon branded channels.

Nickelodeon in the United Kingdom aired reruns of the show from 1993 to 1994. Nickelodeon GAS aired reruns of the show in 2003 as part of Camp GAS. TeenNick aired reruns of the show from 2011 to 2015 as part of The &#x27;90s Are All That.

The original pilot was considered lost media until it was uploaded to YouTube by Ian Giatti in January 2023.

==Home media==

The complete series has never been released on any form of home media.

When TVShowsOnDVD.com shut down their website in May 2018, &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; was the #1 user-voted television show that had yet to see a physical release on DVD or Blu-ray. Tim Eyster attempted to work with the rightsholder on a DVD release, but it was determined the cost of music licensing and royalty payments to the cast would make such a release unprofitable.

As of 2022, Amazon has twelve episodes of the show available for online purchase. iTunes and Paramount+ offer ten of those same episodes.

<doc id="444584" wikidata="Q1092400" url="?curid=444584" title="Clause IV">
<text>Clause IV is part of the Labour Party Rule Book which sets out the aims and values of the British Labour Party. The original clause, adopted in 1918, called for common ownership of industry, and proved controversial in later years; Hugh Gaitskell attempted to remove the clause following Labour&#x27;s loss in the 1959 general election.

In 1995, under the leadership of Tony Blair, a new Clause IV was adopted. This was seen as a significant moment in Blair&#x27;s redefinition of the party as New Labour, but has in the years since survived beyond the New Labour branding.

==Text==

The original version of Clause IV was drafted by Sidney and Beatrice Webb in November 1917, and adopted by the party in 1918. It read, in part 4:

This section was widely seen as the Labour Party&#x27;s commitment to socialism, even though the word &quot;socialism&quot; is not explicitly mentioned. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; heralded it as showing &quot;the Birth of a Socialist Party&quot;, stating that:
In 1918, nationalisation was seen by many voters as akin to modernisation – the nationalisation of the railways was a widely supported policy, for instance, as it would reduce the plethora of uncoordinated and competing companies. This text is usually assumed to involve nationalisation of the whole economy, but close reading of the text shows that there are many other possible interpretations. Common ownership, though later given a technical definition in the Industrial Common Ownership Act 1976, could mean municipal ownership, worker cooperatives or consumer cooperatives.

In December 1944, the Labour Party adopted a policy of &quot;public ownership&quot; and won a clear endorsement for its policies – the destruction of the &quot;evil giants&quot; of want, ignorance, squalour, disease and idleness (identified by William Beveridge in the Beveridge Report)– in the post-war election victory of 1945 which brought Clement Attlee to power. However, the party had no clear plan as to how public ownership would shape their reforms, and much debate ensued.

The nationalization was led by Herbert Morrison, who had had the experience of uniting London&#x27;s buses and underground train system into a centralized system in the 1930s. He started with the Bank of England in April 1946, whereby stockholders received compensation and the governor and deputy governor were both re-appointed. Further industries swiftly followed: civil aviation in 1946, and railways and telecommunications in 1947, along with the creation of the National Coal Board, which was responsible for supplying 90% of the UK&#x27;s energy needs. 1946 also saw the establishment of the National Health Service, which came into force in July 1948; railways, canals, road haulage and electricity were all also nationalised in 1948. By 1951, the iron, steel and gas industries had also been brought into public ownership.

==Hugh Gaitskell&#x27;s fight==
After losing the 1959 general election, Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell came to believe that public opposition to nationalisation had led to the party&#x27;s poor performance and proposed to amend Clause IV. The left wing of the party fought back and managed to defeat any change: symbolically, it was then agreed to include Clause IV, part 4, on Labour Party membership cards.

The economic crisis of the 1970s, and the defeats suffered by the trade union movement, as well as the decline in influence of the Communist Party of Great Britain, led to a strengthening of the position of Labour Party members who were opposed to Marxism.
==Tony Blair&#x27;s alteration==
Tony Blair had in 1993, before becoming Leader of the Labour Party, written a pamphlet for the Fabian Society which criticised the wording of Clause IV for not clearly stating the means and ends of the party. Blair put forward a case for re-defining socialism in terms of a set of values which were constant, while the policies needed to achieve them would have to account for a changing society. At the conclusion of the 1994 conference, after becoming Leader, Blair proposed that the Labour Party needed a new statement of aims and values and stated that he would draw one up and present it to the party. This astonished many people, as the last time such a move had been taken in the late 1950s, it had been a failure. The new version was adopted at a Special Conference at Easter 1995 following a debate, and reads, in part:

This version of Clause IV on the back of individual Labour Party membership cards today.

Presentationally, the abandonment of the socialist principles of the original Clause IV represented a break with Labour&#x27;s past and, specifically, a break with its 1983 Manifesto (dubbed &quot;the longest suicide note in history&quot;, by Gerald Kaufman, one of the party&#x27;s MPs), in which greater state ownership was proposed.

== Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership ==
The , Jeremy Corbyn, was a consistent supporter of renationalising public utilities, such as British Rail and energy companies, to bring them back into public ownership.

Corbyn ignited controversy within his party in an interview with &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;: 

Although this has been seen by some as an endorsement for the reinstatement of the original Clause IV, Corbyn denied this and said that more discussion within the party was needed.

==Other uses==

Clause Four was also the name of a campaigning group within the Labour Party&#x27;s student wing (now Labour Students), which succeeded in ending its control by the Militant group in 1975. However, the attempt of the Clause Four group to oppose Militant in the Labour Party Young Socialists (LPYS) was a failure, and LPYS was eventually dissolved.

===Clause Four moment===
The changing of Clause IV was seen by political commentators as the defining moment at which Old Labour became New Labour. The phrase &quot;Clause Four moment&quot; has subsequently become a metaphor for any need or perceived need for a fundamental recasting of a political party&#x27;s principles or attitudes.

<text>Arun Jaitley (28 December 1952 – 24 August 2019) was an Indian politician and attorney. A member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Jaitley served as the Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs of the Government of India from 2014 to 2019. Jaitley previously held the cabinet portfolios of Finance, Defence, Corporate Affairs, Commerce and Industry, and Law and Justice in the Vajpayee government and Narendra Modi government.

From 2009 to 2014, he served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. He was a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of India. He oversaw the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax which brought the country under one GST regime, demonetisation, merger of Railway budget with general budget and introduction of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Jaitley decided not to join the second Modi Cabinet in 2019, due to health issues.

He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, posthumously in 2020 in the field of Public Affairs.

==Early life==
Arun Jaitley was born on 28 December 1952 in Delhi into a Punjabi Brahmin family which migrated from Lahore during Partition of India. His father Maharaj Kishen Jaitley was a lawyer and mother Ratan Prabha Jaitley a housewife. He studied at St. Xavier&#x27;s Senior Secondary School, Delhi from 1957 to 1969. He graduated with the honours degree in commerce, B.Com from Shri Ram College of Commerce of Delhi University in 1973. He passed his LL.B. degree from Faculty of Law, University of Delhi in 1977.

Jaitley was the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) student leader at the Delhi University Campus in the seventies and rose to be the President of the Students Union of Delhi University in 1974. During the period of proclamation of Internal Emergency (1975–77) when fundamental rights were suspended, he was under preventive detention for a period of 19 months. He was a prominent leader of a movement against corruption launched in the year 1973 by Raj Narain and Jayaprakash Narayan. He was the convener of the National Committee for Students and Youth organisation appointed by Jai Prakash Narayan. He was also active in civil rights movement and helped found PUCL Bulletin along with Satish Jha and Smitu Kothari. After being released from jail, he joined the Jan Sangh.

In 1977, being the convener of the Loktantrik Yuva Morcha at a time when the Congress suffered defeat, Jaitley was appointed the president of the Delhi ABVP and All India Secretary of the ABVP. He was then made the president of the youth wing of the BJP and the secretary of the Delhi Unit in 1980, a short time after joining the party.

==Legal career==

Since 1977, Jaitley had been practising law in the Supreme Court of India and several High Courts in India. In January 1990, he was designated as a Senior Advocate by the Delhi High Court.

He was appointed Additional Solicitor General of India by the V. P. Singh government in 1989 and did the paperwork for the investigations into the Bofors scandal. His clients cover the political spectrum from Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal to Madhavrao Scindia of the Indian National Congress to L. K. Advani of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Several publications on legal and current affairs were written by him. A paper on law about corruption and crime in India was presented by him, before the Indo-British Legal Forum. He was appointed the Government of India&#x27;s delegate to the United Nations General Assembly Session in June 1998 which approved the Declaration on Laws Relating to Drugs and Money Laundering.

Jaitley had also appeared on behalf of giant multinational corporations such as PepsiCo against Coca-Cola and in various other cases in India. After having been the Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, Jaitley represented Pepsi in 2002 in a case where the Supreme Court of India admonished and imposed stiff fines on 8 companies for painting advertisements on ecologically fragile rocks along the Manali-Rohtang road in the Himalayas. &quot;The companies were also issued show-cause notices as to why exemplary damages should not be imposed on them for indulging in environmental vandalism.&quot; In 2004, Jaitley appeared on behalf of Coca-Cola in a Rajasthan High Court case.

Given his political duties as Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Jaitley stopped practising law in June 2009.

==Political career==
Jaitley had been a member of the national executive of Bharatiya Janata Party since 1991. He became the spokesperson of the BJP during the period preceding the 1999 general election.

=== Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting (1999–2000) ===
On 13 October 1999, after the Vajpayee Government of the BJP led National Democratic Alliance came to power, he was appointed Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting (Independent Charge). In addition he was appointed Minister of State for Disinvestment (Independent Charge). The disinvestment ministry was created for the first time in accordance with the policy of disinvestment under the World Trade Organization regime. On 23 July 2000 following the resignation of Ram Jethmalani as the Union Cabinet Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, he took over his ministry as an additional charge.

=== Union Minister of Law and Justice (2000–04) ===
In November 2000 Jaitley was made a Cabinet Minister for the Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs and Shipping. The Ministry of Surface Transport was bifurcated and he was appointed as the first Minister of Shipping. He demitted the office of the Minister for Shipping with effect from 1 September 2001 and as Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs on 1 July 2002. He then served as the General Secretary of the BJP and its national spokesman. He worked in this capacity until January 2003. He rejoined the Union Cabinet as the Minister of Commerce &amp; Industry and Law &amp; Justice on 29 January 2003. With the defeat of the National Democratic Alliance in May 2004, Jaitley returned to his legal career and worked in the Supreme Court.

=== Leader of the Opposition, Rajya Sabha (2009–14) ===
He was chosen as the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha on 3 June 2009 by L.K. Advani. On 16 June 2009, he resigned from the post of General Secretary of the BJP, as per his party&#x27;s One Man One Post principle. He was also a member of the Central Election Committee of the party. As the leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, he participated in the debates on the Women&#x27;s Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha and also supported Anna Hazare in his 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement for the Jan Lokpal Bill. He successfully introduced the 84th amendment to the Constitution of India in 2002, freezing parliamentary seats until 2026, and the ninety-first amendment to the Constitution of India in 2004, penalising defections. However, being in the party since 1980, he never contested any direct election until 2014. He was the BJP candidate for the Amritsar seat in the Lok Sabha (replacing Navjot Singh Sidhu) for the 2014 general election, but lost to the Indian National Congress candidate Amarinder Singh. He was elected as a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat. He was re-elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh in March 2018.

On 26 August 2012, he said (outside Parliament) &quot;There are occasions when an obstruction in Parliament brings greater benefits to the country.&quot; This statement was considered to have given legitimacy to obstruction by the parliament in contemporary Indian politics. After forming a government in 2014, the BJP government has faced disruption and obstruction in parliament multiple times, and the opposition have referred to this statement as a legitimising that floor strategy.

=== Union Finance Minister (2014–19) ===

On 26 May 2014, Jaitley was selected by newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Corporate Affairs and the Minister of Defence, in his cabinet. Analysts cited Jaitley&#x27;s &quot;part-time&quot; focus on defence as a simple continuation of the policies of the previous government. According to a WikiLeaks cable by Robert Blake, the Charge at the US Embassy, to his government, When raised on the question of Hindutva, Jaitley had argued that Hindu nationalism &quot;will always be a talking point&quot; for the BJP and characterised this as an opportunistic issue. Jaitley later clarified that &quot;the use of the word opportunistic in reference to nationalism or Hindu nationalism is neither my view nor my language. It could be the diplomat&#x27;s own usage.&quot;

During the 2015 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, Arun Jaitley agreed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s assertions that the idea of reservations on the basis of religion is fraught with danger and was against giving reservations to Muslim Dalits and Christian Dalits as it might impact demography. He also served as a member to the Board of Governors of Asian Development Bank. In November 2015, Jaitley said that personal laws governing marriages and divorces should be subject to fundamental rights, as constitutionally-guaranteed rights are supreme. He announced the Income declaration scheme, 2016 in September 2016.

During his tenure as the Finance Minister of India, the government demonetised the ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, fake currency, and terrorism from 9 November 2016. He oversaw the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) which brought the country under one GST regime. On 20 June 2017, he reaffirmed that the roll-out of GST overseen by him as the finance minister was on track.

Out Leadership recommended Arun Jaitley as one of the experts and leaders who openly speak on LGBT+ issues.

On 29 May 2019, in a letter to Prime Minister Modi, Arun Jaitley cited his health as a reason for not taking an active role in the formation of the new government, effectively declining a role as a minister in the second term of Prime Minister Modi.

In January 2019 Jaitley generated controversy when he accused the Central Bureau of Investigation of &quot;investigative adventurism&quot; in the ICICI Bank – Videocon fraud case. The Central Bureau of Investigation had named Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar as beneficiaries in the financial fraud, in which Venugopal Dhoot, the promoter of Videocon had fraudulently transferred part of the loan received from ICICI Bank to the Kochhar&#x27;s business entreprise. Jaitley stated that naming the corrupt bank officials will not help in the investigation. Previously in September 2012, Jaitley had warned CBI on corruption cases involving political leaders from Gujarat.

==Personal life==
Arun Jaitley married Sangeeta, daughter of former Jammu and Kashmir finance minister Girdhari Lal Dogra, on 24 May 1982. They have two children, Rohan Jaitley and Sonali Jaitley; the latter married Jaiyesh Bakhshi. Both his children are lawyers. He had two siblings.

==Illness and death==
Jaitley had a series of health-related issues and underwent multiple surgeries leading into his deteriorating health and subsequent death in 2019. In 2005, he underwent a coronary artery bypass surgery after he was hospitalised with high blood pressure. In 2014, when he weighed , a gastric bypass surgery was performed on him aimed at reducing his weight. Doctors confirmed that Jaitley had been &quot;suffering from diabetes for nearly two decades&quot; then, and that the said procedure was the best option for patients with &quot;uncontrolled diabetes&quot;. In May 2018, he underwent a kidney transplant surgery.

In February 2019, the media reported that Jaitley had been diagnosed with a rare form of soft-tissue sarcoma and was undergoing treatment in the US, although it was termed a &quot;regular medical check-up&quot;. On 9 August, he was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (AIIMS) after he complained of &quot;breathlessness&quot;. On 17 August, it was reported that he was on life-support.

By 23 August, his health had deteriorated. Jaitley died at 12:07 p.m. (IST) the following day, aged 66. He was cremated at Nigam Bodh Ghat on 25 August. The Indian Cricket team wore black armbands for a day during the test match with the West Indies, to condole Jaitley&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
On 12 September 2019, Delhi&#x27;s Feroz Shah Kotla stadium was renamed as Arun Jaitley Stadium at a function held at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in memory of Jaitley. The decision to name the stadium after him came as he was once the president of DDCA and also the vice-president of the BCCI.

On 28 December 2020, Home Minister Amit Shah unveiled a statue of Arun Jaitley at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.

<text>John Charles Herries PC (November 1778 – 24 April 1855), known as J. C. Herries, was a British politician and financier and a frequent member of Tory and Conservative cabinets in the early to mid-19th century.

==Background and education==
Herries was the eldest son of Charles Herries, a London merchant, by his wife Mary Ann Johnson, and was educated at Cheam and the University of Leipzig.

==Political career==
Herries worked his way up in the Treasury and eventually became Secretary to the First Lord of the Treasury, Commissary-General to the Army, Paymaster of the Civil List, Secretary to the Treasury (1823–1827), Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord Goderich&#x27;s government (1827–1828), Master of the Mint under the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), briefly President of the Board of Trade (1830), Secretary at War under Sir Robert Peel (1834–1835), and finally President of the Board of Control in Lord Derby&#x27;s first government (1852). During his tenure as Commissary-General, he used the help of Nathan Mayer Rothschild to transfer money to British and allied army troops on the continent, which was not an easy task during the Continental Blockade. Rothschild&#x27;s successful conclusion of these transfers was one of the foundations of the house&#x27;s English banking empire.

Herries was one of few men of ministerial experience to side with the protectionist Tories after the repeal of the Corn Laws. Following the death of Lord George Bentinck in 1848, Herries was suggested by Lord Stanley as an alternative to Benjamin Disraeli as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. In the end Herries declined, and Disraeli gradually came into his own as leader. Staunchly protectionist, Herries was in repeated conflict with Disraeli who, despite championing protectionism barely six years before, was hurriedly disassociating himself and the party from that doctrine. The two never got along, and Herries&#x27; refusal to assist in the framing of the 1852 Budget (which he regarded as &quot;wild work&quot;), cannot have helped matters. By the time of Derby&#x27;s second government in 1858, Herries had died. His son, Charles Herries, was appointed Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue by Disraeli during the latter&#x27;s second premiership in 1877.

==Family==
Herries married Sarah, daughter of John Dorington, in 1814. They had three sons, one of whom, Sir Charles Herries, was a well-known financier. Sarah died in February 1821. Herries survived her by over thirty years and died at St Julians, near Sevenoaks, Kent, in April 1855, aged 76.

<doc id="444599" wikidata="Q3054135" url="?curid=444599" title="Tigana">
<text>Tigana is a 1990 fantasy novel by Canadian writer Guy Gavriel Kay. The novel is set in a region called the Peninsula of the Palm, which somewhat resembles Renaissance Italy as well as the Peloponnese in shape.

==Setting==
The world where &quot;Tigana&quot; takes place is a planet orbited by two moons. Kay notes that some of his readers tried to connect &quot;Tigana&quot; with &quot;A Song for Arbonne&quot; by speculating the stories take place on the same fictional world; Kay explained that he only repeated the same idea rather than attempting to expand his canon.

Action is centered on the Peninsula of the Palm, which shares a common culture and language, but, like medieval Italy, is not a unified nation, comprising instead nine provinces with a long history of internecine struggle. The provinces are: Asoli, Astibar, Certando, Chiara, Corte, Ferraut, Senzio, Tigana, and Tregea. With great subtlety, Kay conveys the fact that all this takes place in the Southern Hemisphere of the unnamed world.

This internal conflict facilitates the conquest of the region by two powerful sorcerers: Brandin, the King of Ygrath, and Alberico, an independent warlord from the empire of Barbadior. The two sorcerers conquered simultaneously but independently the peninsula, and have divided it in an uneasy balance of power.

Kay says that the province of Tigana, and thus the book, was inadvertently named after the football player Jean Tigana. Because of this, the Italian edition of the novel uses the name &quot;Tigane&quot; instead.

===Mythology===
The religion of the Palm is centered on a triad of deities, a God and two Goddesses; the one being his sister-wife and the other being their daughter. An annual feast celebrates the torment and deicide of the God by his sister-wife and daughter, their eating of his flesh, and his rebirth.

===Riselka===
The riselka is the only supernatural creature of the book. Based on the rusalka of Slavic folklore and mythology, its appearance in Kay&#x27;s world is a token of some portent. A portion of it reads as follows:

:One man sees a riselka: his life forks there.
:Two men see a riselka: one of them shall die.
:Three men see a riselka: one is blessed, one forks, one shall die.
:One woman sees a riselka: her path comes clear to her.
:Two women see a riselka: one of them shall bear a child.
:Three women see a riselka: one is blessed, one is clear, one shall bear a child.

==Plot==
A group of rebels attempting to overthrow both tyrants and win back their homeland. Many of the rebels are natives of the province of Tigana, which was the province that most ably resisted Brandin; in a crucial battle, Brandin&#x27;s son was killed. In retaliation for this, Brandin attacked Tigana and crushed it more savagely than any other part of the Palm; then he used his magic to remove the name and history of Tigana from the minds of the population. Brandin named it Lower Corte, making Corte, their traditional enemies to their north, seem superior to a land that was all but forgotten.

Only those born in Tigana before the invasion can hear or speak its name, or remember it as it was; as far as everyone else is concerned, that area of the country has always been an insignificant part of a neighbouring province, hence the rebels are battling for the very soul of their country.

In the end the rebels engineer a battle between their two enemies hoping they will defeat each other. After victory, the magic preventing others from remembering the province of Tigana is removed.

==Awards==
&quot;Tigana&quot; was nominated for the 1991 World Fantasy Award—Novel and Aurora Award for Best Novel, winning the latter.

<text>The flag of Oman () consists of a horizontal tricolor of white, red and green with a vertical red stripe on the left that contains the national emblem of Oman (Khanjar and two swords).

== History ==
Until 1970, Oman used the plain red banner of the indigenous people. In 1970, the Sultan introduced a new national flag and set of ensigns. The simple red flag of Muscat and Oman was modified by addition of the white and green bands to the fly, and the national emblem, the badge of the al-Busaidi dynasty, was placed in the canton. This depicts crossed swords over a &quot;khanjar&quot;, a traditional curved dagger. White has been associated historically with the Imam, the religious leader of Oman, and at times the political rival to the ruling Sultan. It also symbolizes peace. Green is traditionally associated with the Jabal al-Akdar, or &quot;Green Mountains,&quot; which lie toward the north of the country. Red is a common color in Gulf state flags. The national emblem is said to date back to the 18th century. A curved dagger is fastened over a pair of crossed swords. An ornate horsebit links the weapons and culture. 

Between 1970 and 1995, the size of the middle band of the triband was slimmer than the other two, making up approximately one fifth of its height, the other bands two-fifths.

== Other flags ==
The naval ensign shows an &quot;azure&quot; (blue) field, with the flag of Oman in the canton and the naval service emblem in the fly.

The standard of the Sultan of Oman is red with a green border whose width is about one-sixth of the height of the flag, surrounded by a red border of about the same width. It bears the country&#x27;s emblem as a charge in the center, colored gold.

<text>The national emblem of Oman () is Khanjar Wa Sayfain (Khanjar (dagger) and two swords), an insignia consisting of a &quot;Khanjar&quot; inside its sheath that is superimposed upon two crossed swords. Adopted in the 18th century as the badge of the Omani royal family, it subsequently became the national emblem of the Sultanate of Oman. The emblem is featured at the canton on the Flag of Oman.

==History==
The national emblem was first designed in the mid-18th century, when it was adopted as the royal crest of the Al Said dynasty. Its usage was expanded when it subsequently became the national emblem of the sultanate. This occurred during the reign of either Faisal bin Turki (1888–1913) or Taimur bin Feisal (1913–1932). The emblem was later incorporated onto the canton of the country&#x27;s national flag in 1970. Moreover, in order to distinguish &quot;directly royal entities&quot; and create a distinct symbol for these organizations, a crown was added to the top of the national emblem. This modified insignia is utilized on the badges of all branches of Sultan&#x27;s Armed Forces, including the Royal Army, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, Royal Guard, and Royal Oman Police – among many others.

==Design==

===Symbolism===
According to the Omani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the &quot;Khanjar&quot; – along with the two crossed swords – symbolize the historic weapons utilized by the people of Oman. They are attached together by an embellished [waist belt with its Khanjar at the centre.] The &quot;Khanjar&quot; itself is a national symbol of the sultanate, and is still worn by Omani men as a &quot;ceremonial dagger&quot; for formal occasions.

===Legal protection===
Under a Royal Decree issued in 2004, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is required to give authorization before any merchandise – both domestic and foreign imports – is allowed to depict the national emblem. Failure to do so may result in the seizure of those products, along with a fine and prosecution. Furthermore, the decree also forbids the desecration and/or destruction of the emblem. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of OMR1,000 and imprisonment of up to three years.

<doc id="444605" wikidata="Q132291970" url="?curid=444605" title="Whitebeam">
<text>The whitebeams are members of the family Rosaceae, tribe Malinae, comprising a number of deciduous simple or lobe-leaved species formerly lumped together within &quot;Sorbus&quot; s.l. Many whitebeams are the result of extensive intergeneric hybridisation involving the genera &quot;Sorbus&quot; (&quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot; in particular), &quot;Aria&quot;, &quot;Torminalis&quot; and &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot;. As an effect, they are commonly apomicts (reproducing solely asexually) and many have very restricted ranges. The best known species is the common whitebeam (&quot;Aria edulis&quot;), a columnar tree which grows to tall by broad, with clusters of white flowers in spring followed by speckled red berries in autumn (fall).

==Appearance==
In many species, the surface of the leaves is an unremarkable mid-green, but the underside is pale to almost white (hence the name) with pale grey or white hairs, transforming the appearance of the tree in strong winds, as noted by the poet Meredith: &quot;flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted whitebeam&quot;. It is also described as the &quot;wind-beat whitebeam&quot; in Gerard Manley Hopkins&#x27; poem &quot;The Starlight Night&quot;.

==Ecology==
The berries are a favourite of fruit-eating birds like thrushes and waxwings, though are less palatable (drier, less juicy) than rowan berries. Whitebeams are sometimes used as larval food plants by species of Lepidoptera, including the short-cloaked moth.

==Uses==

These trees are often grown in parks and large gardens. The cultivars &quot;A. edulis&quot; &#x27;Lutescens&#x27; and &quot;A. edulis&quot; &#x27;Majestica&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The tough, hard wood is a deep orange when wet, and pale yellow after drying.

The fruit is edible, but only when nearly rotten.

==Taxonomy==
Whitebeams are not a natural monophyletic taxonomic grouping; they are representatives of several genera of the Malinae subtribe, all of which were traditionally treated within a broadly circumscribed genus &quot;Sorbus&quot; s.l. This treatment of &quot;Sorbus&quot; was however was found to be polyphyletic, comprising two monophyletic clades that were not particularly closely related to each other. Now, &quot;Sorbus&quot; is more often defined in a narrow sense to include only the rowans or mountain-ashes, with all the other former members being elevated into genera in their own right. Species which are commonly referred to as whitebeams can be found in several genera, five of which are the result of intergeneric hybridisation.

=== Non-hybridogenous whitebeam genera ===

==== In western Eurasia ====
* &quot;Aria&quot;
* &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot;

<doc id="444606" wikidata="Q1598166" url="?curid=444606" title="Pro Electron">
<text>Pro Electron or EECA is the European type designation and registration system for active devices (such as semiconductors, liquid crystal displays, sensor devices, electronic tubes and cathode-ray tubes).

Pro Electron was set up in 1966 in Brussels, Belgium. In 1983 it was merged with the European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA) and since then operates as an agency of the EECA.

The goal of Pro Electron is to allow unambiguous identification of electronic parts, even when made by several different manufacturers. To this end, manufacturers register new devices with the agency and receive new type designators for them.

== Designation system ==
Examples of Pro Electron type designators are:
* AD162 – Germanium power transistor for audio frequency use
* BY133 – Silicon rectifier
* BZY88C5V1 – Silicon 5.1 volt Zener diode
* CQY97 – light emitting diode
* ECC83 – 6.3 volt heater noval dual triode
* A63EAA00XX01 – Color TV picture tube
* SAA1300 – Digital integrated circuit

Pro Electron took the popular European coding system in use from around 1934 for valves (tubes), i.e. the Mullard–Philips tube designation, and essentially re-allocated several of the rarely used heater designations (first letter of the part number) for semiconductors. The second letter was used in a similar way to the valves naming convention: &quot;A&quot; for signal diode, &quot;C&quot; for low-power bipolar transistor or triode, &quot;D&quot; for high-power transistor (or triode), and &quot;Y&quot; for rectifier, but other letter designations did not follow the vacuum tube mode so closely.

The three digits (or letter followed by two digits) after the first two letters were essentially a sequence number, with (at first) a vestige of the valve-era convention that the first one or two digits would indicate the base (package) type in examples such as in this family of general-purpose transistors:

... where x may be:
* 7 for high voltage
* 8 for general purpose
* 9 for low noise/high gain

Pro Electron naming for transistors and Zener diodes has been widely taken up by semiconductor manufactures around the world. Pro Electron naming of integrated circuits, other than some special (e.g. television signal-processing) chips, did not greatly take hold (even in Europe). Other popular designation systems were used for many integrated circuits.

===Differences between Pro Electron and earlier valve-naming conventions ===

* Unlike the tube naming convention, if there are two transistors in a single envelope, the type letter was never repeated - so a dual NPN RF transistor might get a type &quot;BFM505&quot; rather than something like &quot;BFF505&quot; for instance. 
* Although some of the most popular devices conform to a pattern of serial numbers that identified package type and polarity, many do not.
* The letters assigned for the second character of transistor and diode type numbers differ in several ways, e.g.
** &quot;B&quot; tends to be used for dual &quot;varicap&quot; diodes
** &quot;L&quot; in the context of transistors designates RF power (transmitting) transistors; for valves it meant a high-power pentode tube (the usual choice for power RF)
** &quot;Z&quot; is used for semiconductor Zener diodes instead of (full-wave) rectifier valves (tubes).

=== Frequently used first letters in European active devices ===

**A Germanium (or any semiconductor with junctions in a material with a band gap of 0.6 to 1.0eV)
**B Silicon (or band gap of 1.0 to 1.3eV)
**C III-V semiconductors with a band gap of 1.3eV or more, like gallium arsenide in LEDs
**D may be...
***Semiconductors with a band gap less than 0.6eV, such as indium antimonide in infrared detectors (rarely used), or
***(Mullard–Philips) 1.4V (or less) filament tubes
**E (Mullard–Philips) tubes with a 6.3V heater
**F Digital integrated circuits
**P (Mullard–Philips) tubes for a 300mA series heater supply
**R Devices without junctions, e.g. cadmium sulfide in a photoresistor
**S Solitary digital integrated circuits
**T Linear integrated circuits
**U may be...
*** (Mullard–Philips) tubes for a 100mA series heater supply, or
*** Mixed digital/analogue integrated circuits

==Electron tubes ==

* See Mullard–Philips tube designation for details. A brief summary of &quot;just the more common&quot; letters is:
 ECC81
 / \ \\__ last digit(s)=serial number
 / \ \__ first digit(s)=base (3=8pin 8,18,80=Noval (B9A), 9=Mini 7-pin (B7G)
 / \___ one letter per valve unit in the tube:
 D=1.4v or less A=single-diode (low power)
 E=6.3v* B=double-diode (&quot;usually&quot; shared cathode, &quot;but not always&quot;)
 P=300mA C=triode
 U=100mA F=pentode (low power)
 L=pentode (high power)
 Y=Single-phase rectifier
 Z=Full-wave rectifier
 * Note: some 6.3 volt heater types have a split heater allowing series (12.6 volt; the
 default for Noval pins 4 to 5) or parallel (6.3 volt) operation.

==Semiconductor diodes and transistors==

===The first letter gives the semiconductor type===
(see above)

===The second letter denotes the intended use===

===The serial number===
Following these two letters is a 3- or 4-digit serial number (or another letter then digits), assigned by Pro Electron. It is not always merely a sequence number; there is sometimes information conveyed in the number:
* In early devices only, the serial number often indicated the case/package type (e.g. AF114-7 for TO-5 case, while AF124-7 were TO-72 versions of the same transistors); modern surface-mount devices often begin with &quot;8&quot;,
* early silicon transistors followed the convention of using a middle digit of 0-5 for NPN and 6-9 for PNP. 
* the last digit often indicated a particular specification or application grouping, e.g. the AF117 and AF127 were similar IF amplifier devices in different cases; the BC109, BC149, BC169 and BC549 are similar low-noise transistors).
* some modern devices use letters, such as &quot;B&quot; to indicate HBT bipolar transistors.&lt;ref name=&quot;D15/2010-07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suffixes and version specifiers===
Suffixes may be used, letters or perhaps blocks of digits delimited by &quot;/&quot; or &quot;-&quot; from the serial number, often without fixed meanings but some of the more common conventions are:
* for small-signal transistors &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot; often means low to high hFE, such as in: BC549C),
* numeric suffixes may be used as an alternative way to show hFE (e.g. BC327-25), or voltage rating (e.g. BUK854-800A).
* for voltage reference diodes letters show the tolerance (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot; indicate 1%/2%/5%/10*/20%) and may be followed by the Vz value, e.g. 6V8 for 6.8 Volts or 18V for 18 volts.
* &quot;R&quot; can mean &quot;reverse polarity&quot;.

Examples of suffixes and manufacturers&#x27; extensions to the basic sequence number include:

Note: A BC546 might only be marked &quot;C546&quot; by some manufacturers, thus possibly creating confusion with JIS abbreviated markings, because a transistor marked &quot;C546&quot; might also be a 2SC546.

Short summary of the most common semiconductor diode and transistor designations:
 BC549C
 / |--- \___ variant (A,B,C for transistors implies low, medium or high gain)
 / | \____ serial number (at least 3 digits or letter and 2 digits)
 / device type:
 A=Ge A=Signal diode
 B=Si C=LF low-power transistor
 D=LF Power transistor
 F=RF transistor (or FET) 
 P=Photosensitive transistor etc.
 T=Triac or thyristor
 Y=Rectifier diode
 Z=Zener diode

===Usage in the Eastern Bloc===
Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Cuba mostly used Pro Electron designations for discrete semiconductors just like Western Europe. Starting in 1971, in Poland the letter &quot;P&quot; was inserted, e.g. BUY54 became BUYP54. Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt (KME) in East Germany and Tesla (Czechoslovak company) used designations derived from the Pro Electron scheme. In particular, the first letter specifying the material differed while the second letter followed the table above (with the few exceptions for KME noted below).


Examples: - Germanium power transistor from KME; - optoisolator from KME; KD503 - Silicon power transistor from Tesla; - LED from Tesla.

==Integrated circuits==
The integrated circuit designation consists of three letters, followed by a serial number of three to five digits. Initially, only three-digit serial numbers were allowed. For designations with a three-digit serial number the third initial letter had a defined meaning for digital integrated circuits (see below) and the operating temperature range was encoded in the last digit of the serial number. The specification was changed in 1973 to allow longer serial numbers. For designations with a serial number of more than three digits the third initial letter encodes the temperature range. Optionally, a version letter (A, B, ...) and / or a package designation can follow after the serial number.



=== Digital logic families ===
The combination of first letter and second letter is assigned to a specific manufacturer.

 FCH171
 // \ \__ serial number (including temperature range)
 // \___ H=gate (&quot;Combinatorial circuit&quot;), J=flip-flop, K=monostable, L=level shifter, Q=RAM, R=ROM, Y=miscellaneous etc.
 FC=DTL by Philips / Mullard
 FD=dynamic PMOS by Philips / Mullard
 FE=PMOS by Philips / Mullard
 FH=TTL by Philips (SUHL II series)
 FJ=TTL by Philips / Mullard (7400 series)
 FK=E2CL by Philips
 FL=TTL by Siemens (7400 series)
 FN=ECL by Telefunken
 FP=HTL by Telefunken
 FQ=DTL by SGS-ATES
 FS=SECL by Telefunken
 FY=ECL by Siemens
 FZ=HTL by Siemens
 GD=PMOS by Siemens (MEM1000 series)
 GH=ECL by Philips
 GJ=TTL by Mullard (74H00 series)
 GR=interface devices by Mullard (7500 series)
 GT=TTL by Mullard (74S00 series)

Unfortunately the serial number does not specify the same type of gate in each family, e.g. while an FJH131 is a quadruple 2-input NAND gate (like the 7400), an FCH131 is a dual 4-input NAND gate, and an FLH131 is an 8-input NAND gate (equivalent to 7430). To lessen the confusion at least for the 7400 series, at some point manufacturers included the well-known 7400 series designation both in their literature and on the integrated circuits themselves.

<doc id="444608" wikidata="Q582474" url="?curid=444608" title="Music of Murcia">
<text>Murcia is a region in the South East of Spain with many external influences varying from the ancient Moors that occupied the area for centuries to the adjacent Communities (Andalusia, Castilla–La Mancha, etc.). Its music is determined by the heavy use of string instruments as the bandurria or the Spanish guitar and percussion instruments like the castanets (&quot;castañuelas&quot; or &quot;postizas&quot;) and the tambourine.

Murcian music is most notably represented by the religious songs performed by the Auroros, which are derived from La Mancha and Andalusian folk music. They include a cappella chants, sometimes accompanied by church bells. They are often performed in small paths in orchards at night.

The &quot;cuadrilla&quot; is the typical folk ensemble of Murcia, which is traditionally organized by occupation or guild such as harvesters (&quot;segaores&quot;) or builders (&quot;albañiles&quot;), but now they are performed at celebrations and holidays, especially on Christmas by reduced bands with occasional dancing. The fandango murciano is a well-known variation of the Andalusian fandango characterized by long extensions of the voice. José Verdú&#x27;s &quot;Cantos populares de Murcia&quot; is a well-known collection of Murcian songs.

<text>Auto Union AG was an amalgamation of four German automobile manufacturers, founded in 1932 and established in 1936 in Chemnitz, Saxony. It is the immediate predecessor of Audi as it is known today.

As well as acting as an umbrella firm for its four constituent brands (Audi, Horch, DKW, Wanderer), Auto Union is widely known for its racing team (Auto Union Rennabteilung, based at Horch works in Zwickau/Saxony). The Silver Arrows of the two German teams (Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union) dominated not only GP car racing from 1934 onwards but set records that would take decades to beat, such as the fastest speed ever attained on a public road (at 432.7 km/h (268.9 mph), a record lasting until 2017. After being reduced to near ruin in the aftermath of World War II, Auto Union was re-founded in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, in 1949, ultimately evolving into the modern day Audi company following its takeover by Volkswagen in 1964 and later merger with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969.

The current corporate entity which bears the Auto Union name, Auto Union GmbH, was founded in 1985 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Audi AG; its purpose is to act as owner of Auto Union&#x27;s historical trademarks and intellectual property, as well as managing Audi&#x27;s heritage operations. The company&#x27;s distinctive logo of four interlocking rings to represent the original four members of the Auto Union survives as the logo of Audi.

==Formation==
Auto Union was formed in Germany in 1932 merging:
*Zschopauer Motorenwerke J. S. Rasmussen (brand DKW – steam-driven car) founded by Danish engineer Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen in 1916, it branched out into motorcycles, and then front-drive two-stroke cars built at Audi works in Zwickau since 1931.
*Horch – founded 1904 by August Horch in Zwickau. It built cars starting from straight-twin engines to luxury models with V8- and V12 engines.
*Audi – because of disputes with the CFO, August Horch in 1909 left his namesake enterprise and founded Audi across town, building inline-four-, six- and eight-cylinder-engined cars. In 1928 Audi became a subsidiary of Zschopauer Motorenwerke.
*Wanderer (car division only) – founded in 1911, with small four-cylinder cars and later a more luxurious straight-6 built in Siegmar (now Chemnitz)

In August 1928, Rasmussen, the owner of DKW, acquired a majority ownership of Audiwerke AG. In the same year, Rasmussen bought the remains of the US automobile manufacturer Rickenbacker, including the manufacturing equipment for eight- and six-cylinder engines. These engines were used in &quot;Audi Zwickau&quot;, &quot;Audi Imperator&quot; and &quot;Audi Dresden&quot; models. At the same time, six-cylinder and four-cylinder (licensed from Peugeot) models were manufactured.

In 1930 the Saxony Regional Bank, which had financed Rasmussen&#x27;s business expansion in the 1920s, installed Richard Bruhn on the board of Audiwerke AG, and there followed a brutal pruning and rationalization of the various auto-businesses that Rasmussen had accumulated. The outcome was the founding in Summer 1932 of Auto Union AG with just four component businesses, being Zschopauer Motorenwerke with its brand DKW, Audi, Horch and the car producing piece of Wanderer, brought together under the umbrella of single shareholder company Auto Union. Although all four brands continued to sell cars under their own names and brands, the technological development became more centralized, with some Audi models employing engines by Horch or Wanderer.

==The Auto Union racing cars==
===Background===
Auto Union chairman, Klaus, Baron von Oertzen, wanted a showpiece project to announce the new brand. At the 1933 Berlin Motor Show, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler announced two new programs:
*The people&#x27;s car (&quot;Volks wagen&quot;): a project that became the &quot;KdF&quot; car – the &quot;Strength through Joy&quot; car 
*A state-sponsored motor racing programme: to develop a &quot;high speed German automotive industry,&quot; the foundation of which would be an annual sum of 

At fellow director&#x27;s Adolf Rosenberger insistence, von Oertzen met with Dr. Ferdinand Porsche, who had done work for him before, and developed his own P-Wagen project racing car based on the new formula.

German racing driver Hans Stuck Sr. had met Hitler before he became Chancellor, and not being able to gain a seat at Mercedes, accepted the invitation of Rosenberger to join him, von Oertzen, and Porsche in approaching the Chancellor. In a meeting in the Reich Chancellory, Hitler agreed with Porsche that for the glory of Germany, it would be better for two companies to develop the project, resulting in Hitler agreeing to pay £40,000 for the country&#x27;s best racing car of 1934, as well as an annual stipend of (£20,000) each for Mercedes and Auto Union. (In time, this would climb to £250,000.) This highly annoyed Mercedes, who had already developed their Mercedes-Benz W25; nevertheless, Mercedes was gratified, its racing program having financial difficulties since 1931. It resulted in a heated exchange both on and off the racing track between the two companies until World War II.

Having garnered state funds, Auto Union bought Porsche&#x27;s &quot;Hochleistungsfahrzeugbau GmbH (HFB)&quot; (High Performance Car Ltd.) and hence the P-Wagen Project for , relocating the company to Auto Union&#x27;s Horch plant at Zwickau.

===Design===

The Auto Union racing cars types A to D were built as &quot;Grand Prix&quot; racing cars from 1934 to 1939. They resembled the earlier Benz &quot;Tropfenwagen&quot;, also built in part by Rumpler engineers, The only &quot;Grand Prix&quot; racers to wear Auto Union&#x27;s four-ringed logo, they were particularly dominant in 1936. From 1935 to 1937, Auto Union cars car won 25 races, driven by Ernst von Delius, Bernd Rosemeyer, Hans Stuck Sr., and Achille Varzi. Much has been written about the difficult handling characteristics of this car, but its tremendous power and acceleration were undeniable – a driver could induce wheelspin at over .

The cars used supercharged piston engines; eventually producing almost , designed to provide optimum torque at low engine speeds. Rosemeyer would later drive one around the Nürburgring in a single gear, to prove the engine was flexible enough to do it. Unlike its rivals, it had a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The fuel tank was located in the centre of the car, directly behind the driver (who would be placed well towards the front), so the car&#x27;s front-rear weight distribution would remain unchanged as fuel was used – exactly the same location used in modern open-wheel racing cars, and for the same reason. The chassis tubes were initially used as water carriers from the radiator to the engine, but this was eventually abandoned after they often sprung small leaks.

===Racing results===

The list of drivers for the initial 1934 season was headed by Stuck; he won the German, Swiss, and Czechoslovakian events, along with wins in a number of hill climbs, becoming European Mountain Champion.

In 1935, the engine had been enlarged to displacement, producing . Achille Varzi joined the team and won the Tunis Grand Prix and the Coppa Acerbo. Stuck won the Italian Grand Prix, plus his usual collection of hill-climb wins, again taking the European Mountain Championship. The new sensation, Rosemeyer, won the Czech Grand Prix.
Stuck also managed to break speed records, reaching on an Italian &quot;autostrada&quot; in a closed-cockpit streamliner. Lessons learned from this streamlining were later applied to the T80 land speed record car.
For 1936, the engine had grown to a full , and was now producing ; in the hands of Rosemeyer and his teammates, the Auto Union Type C dominated the racing world. Rosemeyer won the Eifelrennen, German, Swiss, and Italian Grands Prix, as well as the &quot;Coppa Acerbo&quot;. He was crowned European Champion (Auto Union&#x27;s only win of the driver&#x27;s championship), and also took the European Mountain Championship. Varzi won the Tripoli Grand Prix, while Stuck placed second in the Tripoli and German Grands Prix, and Ernst von Delius took second in the &quot;Coppa Acerbo&quot;.

In 1937, the car was basically unchanged and did surprisingly well against the new Mercedes-Benz W125, winning five races to the seven of Mercedes-Benz. Rosemeyer took the Eifel and Donington Grands Prix, the Coppa Acerbo, and the Vanderbilt Cup. Rudolf Hasse won the Belgian Grand Prix.

In addition to the new formula, 1938 brought other challenges, principally the death of Rosemeyer early in the year, in an attempt on the land speed record on a German &quot;autobahn&quot;. Tazio Nuvolari joined the team, and won the Italian and Donington Grands Prix, in what was otherwise a thin year for the team, other than yet another European Mountain Championship for Stuck.

In 1939, as war clouds gathered over Europe, Nuvolari won the Yugoslavia Grand Prix in Belgrade, while Hermann P. Müller won the 1939 French Grand Prix.

==Second World War==
The buildup and onset of World War II encouraged the development and production of special vehicles for military purposes in the 1930s. Auto Union became an important supplier of vehicles to Germany&#x27;s armed forces. Following the outbreak of war, civilian production was interrupted in May 1940. After this, the company produced exclusively for military purposes.

For the production of Junkers aircraft engine under license, Auto Union founded in 1935 the subsidiary &quot;Mitteldeutsche Motorenwerke&quot; (Central German Motor Works) at Taucha, northeast of Leipzig.

During World War II, Auto Union/Horch supplied the chassis for the Sd.Kfz. 222 armored car. Powered by an Horch V8 engine, it reached a top speed of on the road. The all-wheel drive &quot;Kfz. 11&quot;, or Horch/Wanderer Type 901, was used as a medium transport vehicle to shuttle German military officials. Horch works also produced the AWD heavy transport vehicle Type 801 (both named Einheits-PKW der Wehrmacht).

From the beginning of 1944, Auto Union plants (Horch and Audi plant at Zwickau, Mitteldeutsche Motorenwerke and Siegmar/Wanderer plant at Siegmar-Schönau) were heavily bombed and severely damaged. The U.S. Army occupied Zwickau on 17 April 1945 near the end of WWII. After withdrawal of the U.S. Army on 30 June from Zwickau, all Saxon plants of Auto Union were occupied by the Red Army.

The company exploited slave labor at Leitmeritz concentration camp. According to a 2014 report commissioned by the company, Auto Union bore &quot;moral responsibility&quot; for the 4,500 deaths that occurred at Leitmeritz.

==East Germany==
Postwar, the Saxon plants of Auto Union were located in the Soviet-occupied zone of communist East Germany.

In 1945, on the orders of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, the factories were dismantled as war reparations, while the racing cars found stored in a colliery were returned to Moscow for reverse engineering. Following this, Auto Union AG assets were liquidated without compensation. On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register. The remains of Horch and Audi plants of Zwickau became the VEB (for &quot;People Owned Enterprise&quot;) Automobilwerk Zwickau, or AWZ; (Automobile Factory Zwickau).

The former Audi factory in Zwickau, now under East German control, restarted assembly of the pre-war models in 1949. Those models were renamed IFA F8 and IFA F9 and were similar to the new West German DKW versions. In time, a lawsuit compelled the East Germans to cease using the DKW brand. The site became the home of VEB Sachsenring in the 1950s, which manufactured the infamous Trabant. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, Volkswagen took a controlling interest in the old VEB Sachsenring organization, creating the new subsidiary &quot;Volkswagen Sashsen GmbH&quot;, operating initially out of what were the historic Auto Union sites in Zwickau and Chemnitz, which were both eventually rebuilt – in 1993 a new factory was constructed in Zwickau in nearby Mosel, which in 2021 became the centre of production for the Volkswagen Group MEB platform vehicles – notably the Audi Q4 e-tron – making it the first Audi to be manufactured at Zwickau since the pre-war era.

Audi also established the August Horch Museum in 2004 within the surviving factory buildings in Zwickau which dated back to the historic Horch and Audi companies of the 1900s. The museum charts the early histories of Audi, Horch and Auto Union leading up to the company&#x27;s reestablishment in Ingolstadt after WW2.

==New Auto Union==
With the Red Army quickly advancing on Zwickau immediately after the war, and faced with the prospect of trying to salvage what was left of the company, Auto Union&#x27;s executives had no option but to flee and re-establish the company on the Western side of a now partitioned Germany. Thus a new Auto Union company was launched in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, with loans from the Bavarian state government and Marshall Plan aid.

The reformed company Auto Union GmbH was launched on 3 September 1949. The Ingolstadt facility had been run purely as a spare parts operation since 1945, but eventually the directors found the funding to restart production – initially in a converted granary building in the town. With West Germany still in the early stages of rebuilding its economy after the war, the demand for cheap transport meant that only the DKW brand would survive into the postwar era. The luxury focused Audi and Horch brands were placed into dormancy, while Wanderer had been the property of its original parent firm. Auto Union therefore continued DKW&#x27;s tradition of producing affordable front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines. This included production of the small but sturdy DKW RT 125 W motorcycle and a delivery van known as DKW Schnellaster. Many employees of the Saxony factories in Zwickau (Audi and Horch factories), Chemnitz (Siegmar plant, former Wanderer) and Zschopau (DKW Motorcycle factory) came to Ingolstadt and restarted the production.

In 1950, after a former Rheinmetall-Borsig factory in Düsseldorf-Derendorf was established as a second assembly facility, the company&#x27;s first postwar car went into production: the DKW Meisterklasse F 89 P, available as a sedan/saloon, a station wagon and the four-seater convertible built by Karmann. The F 89 were based on the DKW F8 (motor) and the DKW F9 (coachwork) pre-war constructions.

In March 1953, the DKW 3=6 &#x27;Sonderklasse was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show. This car proved exceptionally successful in motorsport and was built in Düsseldorf. The F91 version was soon superseded by the F93 in 1955, and soon joined by the four door F94 and station wagon Universal F94U in 1956 and 1957 respectively.

From 1956 to 1968, about 46,750 DKW Munga light four-wheel drive military vehicles could be produced, mostly for the German and other militaries.

In response to pressure from Friedrich Flick, then its largest single shareholder, Daimler-Benz acquired 87% of Auto Union in April 1958, taking complete control in the following year. In 1958 it saw the return of the Auto Union brand, represented by the Auto Union 1000, a small saloon which enjoyed sporting success. At the same time the 1000 Sp, a coupé, was produced for Auto Union by the coachbuilder Baur at Stuttgart. Under Daimler-Benz ownership the company invested heavily in the Ingolstadt plant. Car production at Düsseldorf was ended, and the plant became the centre of production for Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz L 319 – a role which it continues to the present day. The DKW and Mercedes brands were able to establish a greater presence in the North American market by an agreement with the Studebaker-Packard Corporation in 1956 which through 1964 was the only distributor in the United States. Because of SPC&#x27;s large network of dealers, the Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz brands were able to expand much faster in the US markets. Many dealers today can trace their origin back to being Studebaker-Packard dealerships.

However, as prosperity began to return to West Germany, and as West German products gained valuable currency through export to the rest of Europe and North America, Daimler became increasingly worried that Auto Union&#x27;s only market for its two-stroke products, without massive investment, would be impoverished East Germany. Two-stroke engines became less popular towards the middle of the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the more refined four-stroke engines. They began selling shares, which with the agreed help of the West German Government, were acquired by Volkswagenwerk AG.

In 1964, Volkswagen acquired the factory in Ingolstadt and the trademark rights of Auto Union, with the exception of the dormant Horch brand which Daimler-Benz retained. A programme that Daimler had initiated at Auto Union created a range of cars that would subsequently provide the basis for Volkswagen&#x27;s line of front-wheel-drive models, such as the Audi 80 and Volkswagen Passat. At the time a new model, internally designated F103, was under development. This was based on the last DKW model, the DKW F102, with a four-stroke engine implanted and some front and rear styling changes. Volkswagen abandoned the DKW brand because of association with two-stroke engines, effectively leaving Volkswagen with the Audi brand. The new model was launched in September 1965 as simply the &quot;Audi.&quot; The name was a model designation rather than the manufacturer, which was still officially Auto Union. As more models were later added to the Audi range, this model was renamed Audi 72.
In 1969, Auto Union merged with NSU Motorenwerke AG, based in Neckarsulm, near Stuttgart. In the 1950s, NSU had been the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of motorcycles, but had moved on to produce small cars like the NSU Prinz, the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of Felix Wankel. In 1967, the new NSU Ro 80 was a space-age car, well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety but teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. The mid-sized car NSU had been working on, the K70, was intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic NSU Ro 80. However, Volkswagen took the K70 for its own range, spelling the end of NSU as a separate brand.

After being merged with Neckarsulm car maker NSU, the official name became Audi NSU Auto Union AG, which was simply shortened to Audi AG in 1985, ending both the Auto Union and NSU brands. The company&#x27;s headquarters returned to Ingolstadt; at the same time Audi formed the new companies Auto Union GmbH, and NSU GmbH as wholly owned subsidiaries whose function was to own and protect the historical trademarks and intellectual property of both Auto Union and NSU.

In May 2009, Porsche gained majority control of Volkswagen Group and proposed a merger of the two companies. In August 2009, Volkswagen AG&#x27;s supervisory board signed the agreement to create an integrated Auto group with Porsche led by Volkswagen. Volkswagen will initially take a 42% stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009, and see the family shareholders selling the automotive trading business of Porsche Holding Salsburg to Volkswagen. Rumors began to appear in the press the name Auto Union would be revived for the new group holding company.

===Logo===
The trademark symbol of Auto Union (and present-day Audi), the four overlapping rings, symbolized the four marques forming Auto Union: Audi, DKW, Horch, and Wanderer.

There is also a version of the logo that uses both overlapping and interlocking rings.

==Tribute==
Auto Union was tributed at the 1999 Monterey Historic Automobile Races.

<doc id="444620" wikidata="Q4563884" url="?curid=444620" title="1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak">
<text>On April 5–6, 1936, an outbreak of at least 14 tornadoes struck the Southeastern United States, killing at least 454 people (with 419 of those deaths caused by just two tornadoes) and injuring at least 2,500 others. Over 200 people died in Georgia alone, making it the deadliest disaster ever recorded in the state.

Although the outbreak is often centered on the violent tornadoes in Tupelo, Mississippi (with an estimated F5 rating), and Gainesville, Georgia (estimated F4 rating), there were other destructive tornadoes in the cities of Columbia, Tennessee; Acworth, Georgia; and Anderson, South Carolina. One long-track F4 tornado killed six people in rural parts of Tennessee, and two other long-track tornadoes (rated F3) killed an additional 13 people in southern Tennessee and northern Alabama. Another pair of F3 tornadoes touched down in Mississippi, claiming an additional eight lives. 

This is the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history (after that of the Tri-state tornado in 1925) and the only one in which two separate tornadoes killed more than 200 people each.

==Confirmed tornadoes==

===April 5 event===
===April 6 event===

===Tupelo, Mississippi===
Making its way toward Tupelo, the massive tornado killed a family of 13 as their house was swept away, and injured many more before reaching Tupelo&#x27;s west side. Retroactively rated F5 on the modern Fujita scale, it caused total destruction along its path through the Willis Heights neighborhood. Dozens of large and well built mansions were swept completely away in this area. Although missing the business district, the tornado moved through the residential areas of north Tupelo, destroying many homes, and killing whole families. The Gum Pond area of Tupelo was the worst hit. Homes along the pond were swept into the water with their victims. The majority of the bodies were found in Gum Pond, the area which is now Gumtree Park. Reportedly, many bodies were never recovered from the pond. Reports were that the winds were so strong, pine needles were embedded into trunks of trees. As the tornado exited the city&#x27;s east side, the large concrete Battle of Tupelo monument was toppled to the ground and destroyed. Two nearby brick gate posts were broken off at the base and blown over as well. East of town, granulated structural debris from the city was strewn and wind-rowed for miles through open fields. According to records, the Tupelo tornado leveled 48 city blocks and between 200–900 homes, killing at least 216 people and injuring at least 700 others. The tornado destroyed the water tower and produced numerous fires in its wake, though overnight rains which left knee-deep water in some streets contained the flames. Though 216 remained the final death toll, 100 persons were still hospitalized at the time it was set. Subsequently, the Mississippi State Geologist estimated a final, unofficial death toll of 233. Notably, among the survivors were one-year-old Elvis Presley and his parents.
===Gainesville, Georgia===

After producing the Tupelo tornado, the storm system moved through Alabama overnight and reached Gainesville, Georgia, at around 8:30 a.m local standard time. According to Ted Fujita, this early morning tornado was a double tornado event: one tornado moved in from the Atlanta highway, while the other moved in from the Dawsonville highway. The two merged on Grove Street and destroyed everything throughout the downtown area, causing wreckage to pile high in some places. The worst tornado-caused death toll in a single building in U.S. history was at the Cooper Pants Factory.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke from a train platform in Gainesville on April 9, after the devastating tornado struck the town a few days earlier.
