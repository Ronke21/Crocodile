<text>The Douglas A-4 Skyhawk is a single-seat subsonic carrier-capable light attack aircraft designed and produced by the American aerospace manufacturer Douglas Aircraft Company, and later, McDonnell Douglas. It was originally designated A4D under the United States Navy&#x27;s pre-1962 designation system.

The Skyhawk was developed during the early 1950s on behalf of the U.S. Navy and United States Marine Corps as a replacement for the propeller-driven Douglas A-1 (AD) Skyraider. By comparison, the A-4 is a compact, straightforward, and lightweight aircraft for the era; its maximum takeoff weight of was roughly half of the Navy&#x27;s weight specification. The Skyhawk has a short-span delta wing configuration, a tricycle undercarriage, and is powered by a single turbojet engine. The U.S. Navy issued a contract for the aircraft on 12 June 1952. On 22 June 1954, the XA4D-1 prototype performed its maiden flight; it went on to set a world speed record of 695.163 mph on 15 October 1955. On 1 October 1956, the Skyhawk was introduced to operational service.

The Skyhawk&#x27;s five hardpoints support a variety of missiles, bombs, and other munitions. It is capable of carrying a bomb load equivalent to that of the World War II-era Boeing B-17 bomber, and can deliver nuclear weapons using a low-altitude bombing system and a &quot;loft&quot; delivery technique. Furthermore, it pioneered the concept of &quot;buddy&quot; air-to-air refueling, enabling an aircraft to supply others and reduce the need for dedicated aerial tankers. The Skyhawk was originally powered by the Wright J65 turbojet engine; from the A-4E onwards, the Pratt &amp; Whitney J52 engine was used instead. The Skyhawk was in production through to February 1979, by which point 2,960 aircraft had been delivered to a variety of operators. 555 aircraft alone were built as dedicated two-seat trainers.

The Skyhawk saw active combat on several occasions. The U.S. Navy operated the type as its principal light attack aircraft during the Vietnam War, carrying out some of the first air strikes by the U.S. during the conflict. The Skyhawk was the Israeli Air Force&#x27;s main ground attack aircraft during both the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. In the Falklands War, Argentine Air Force Skyhawks bombed Royal Navy vessels, sinking the Type 42 destroyer and the Type 21 frigate . Kuwaiti Air Force Skyhawks saw action during Operation Desert Storm. In 2022, nearly seven decades after the aircraft&#x27;s first flight in 1954, a number of Skyhawks remain in service with the Argentine Air Force and the Brazilian Naval Aviation.

==Design and development==
The Skyhawk was designed by Douglas Aircraft&#x27;s Ed Heinemann in response to a United States Navy call for a jet-powered attack aircraft to replace the piston-powered Douglas AD Skyraider (later redesignated A-1 Skyraider). Heinemann opted for a design that would minimize its size, weight, and complexity. The result was an aircraft that weighed only half of the Navy&#x27;s weight specification. It had a wing so compact that it did not need to be folded for carrier stowage. The first 500 production examples cost an average of each, less than the Navy&#x27;s one million dollar maximum. The diminutive Skyhawk soon received the nicknames &quot;Scooter&quot;, &quot;Kiddiecar&quot;, &quot;Bantam Bomber&quot;, &quot;Tinker Toy Bomber&quot;, and, on account of its speed and nimble performance, &quot;Heinemann&#x27;s Hot-Rod&quot;. The XA4D-1 prototype set a world speed record of 695.163 mph on 15 October 1955.
The aircraft is of conventional post-World War II design, with a low-mounted delta wing, tricycle undercarriage, and a single turbojet engine in the rear fuselage, with two air intakes on the fuselage sides. The tail is of cruciform design, with the horizontal stabilizer mounted above the fuselage. Armament consisted of two 20 mm (.79 in caliber) Colt Mark 12 cannons, one in each wing root, with 100 rounds per gun (the A-4M Skyhawk II and types based on the A-4M have 200 rounds per gun), plus a large variety of bombs, rockets, and missiles carried on a hardpoint under the fuselage centerline and hardpoints under each wing (originally one per wing, later two).
The short-span delta wing did not require the complexity of wingtip folding, saving an estimated . Its spars were machined from a single forging that spanned across both wingtips. The leading edge slats were designed to drop automatically at the appropriate speed by gravity and air pressure, saving weight and space by omitting actuation motors and switches. Similarly the main undercarriage did not penetrate the main wing spar, designed so that when retracted only the wheel itself was inside the wing and the undercarriage struts were housed in a fairing below the wing. Thus the wing structure was lighter with the same overall strength. The rudder was constructed of a single panel reinforced with external ribs.
The aircraft&#x27;s turbojet engine was accessed for service or replacement by removing the aft section of the fuselage and sliding out the engine. This obviated the need for access doors with their hinges and latches further reducing weight and complexity. This is the opposite of what can often happen in aircraft design where a small weight increase in one area leads to a compounding increase in weight in other areas to compensate, creating a demand for more powerful, heavier engines, larger wing and empennage area, and so on in a vicious circle.

The A-4 pioneered the concept of &quot;buddy&quot; air-to-air refueling. This allows the aircraft to supply others of the same type, reducing the need for dedicated tanker aircraft—a particular advantage for small air arms or when operating in remote locations. This allows for greatly improved operational flexibility and reassurance against the loss or malfunction of tanker aircraft, though this procedure reduces the effective combat force on board the carrier.
A designated supply A-4 would mount a center-mounted &quot;buddy store&quot;, a large external fuel tank with a hose reel in the aft section and an extensible drogue refueling bucket. This aircraft was fueled up without armament and launched first. Attack aircraft were armed to the maximum and were given as much fuel as was allowable by maximum takeoff weight limits, which was far less than a full tank. It was SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) to launch one Skyhawk as a tanker per launch-recovery cycle. In combat, 2-3 Skyhawk tankers were launched, especially if several groups of aircraft were attacking a heavily defended target.

Once airborne, they topped off their fuel tanks from the tanker using the A-4&#x27;s fixed refueling probe on the starboard side of the aircraft nose. They could then sortie with both full armament and fuel loads. The A-4 was rarely used for refueling in U.S. service after the KA-3 Skywarrior tanker became available aboard the larger carriers.

The A-4 was also designed to be able to make an emergency landing, in the event of a hydraulic failure, on the two drop tanks nearly always carried by these aircraft. Such landings resulted in only minor damage to the nose of the aircraft which could be repaired in less than an hour.
The Navy issued a contract for the type on 12 June 1952, and the first prototype first flew from Edwards Air Force Base, California on 22 June 1954. Deliveries to Navy (VA-72) and Marine Corps (VMA-224) squadrons commenced in late 1956.

The Skyhawk remained in production until 1979, with 2,960 aircraft built, including 555 two-seat trainers. The last production A-4, an A-4M of Marine squadron VMA-331 had the flags of all nations that operated the A-4 painted on its fuselage sides.

==Operational history==

===United States===
The Skyhawk proved to be a relatively common United States Navy aircraft export. Due to its small size, it could be operated from older, smaller World War II-era aircraft carriers still used by smaller navies during the 1960s. These older ships were often unable to accommodate newer Navy fighters such as the F-4 Phantom II and F-8 Crusader, which were faster and more capable than the A-4, but significantly larger and heavier.
The Navy operated the A-4 in both Regular Navy and Naval Reserve light attack squadrons (VA). Although the A-4&#x27;s use as a training and adversary aircraft would continue well into the 1990s, the Navy began removing the aircraft from its frontline attack squadrons in 1967, with the last ones (Super Foxes of VA-55/212/164) being retired in 1976.

The Marine Corps would not take the U.S. Navy&#x27;s replacement, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, instead keeping Skyhawks in service with both Regular Marine Corps and Marine Corps Reserve attack squadrons (VMA), and ordering the new A-4M model. The last USMC Skyhawk was delivered in 1979, and they were used until the mid-1980s before they were replaced by the equally small, but more versatile STOVL AV-8 Harrier II.

VMA-131, Marine Aircraft Group 49 (the Diamondbacks) retired its last four OA-4Ms on 22 June 1994. Trainer versions of the Skyhawk remained in Navy service, however, finding a new lease on life with the advent of &quot;adversary training&quot;, where the nimble A-4 was used as a stand-in for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 in dissimilar air combat training (DACT). It served in that role at &quot;TOPGUN&quot; until 1999.
The A-4&#x27;s nimble performance also made it suitable to replace the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II when the Navy downsized its aircraft for the Blue Angels demonstration team, until McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets were available in the 1980s. The last U.S. Navy Skyhawks, TA-4J models belonging to the composite squadron VC-8, remained in military use for target towing, and as adversary aircraft, for combat training at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads. These aircraft were officially retired on 3 May 2003.

Skyhawks were well loved by their crews for being tough and agile. These attributes, along with their low purchase and operating cost as well as easy maintenance, have contributed to the popularity of the A-4 with American and international armed forces. Besides the U.S., at least four other nations have used Skyhawks in combat (Argentina, Indonesia, Israel, and Kuwait).

====Vietnam War era====

Skyhawks were the U.S. Navy&#x27;s primary light attack aircraft used over North Vietnam during the early years of the Vietnam War; later supplanted by the A-7 Corsair II in the U.S. Navy light attack role. Skyhawks carried out some of the first air strikes by the U.S. during the conflict, and a Marine Skyhawk is believed to have dropped the last American bombs on the country. Notable naval aviators who flew the Skyhawk included Lieutenant Commanders Everett Alvarez, Jr. and John McCain, and Commander James Stockdale. On 1 May 1967, an A-4C Skyhawk piloted by Lieutenant Commander Theodore R. Swartz of VA-76 aboard the carrier , shot down a North Vietnamese Air Force MiG-17 with an unguided Zuni rocket, serving as the Skyhawk&#x27;s only air-to-air victory of the Vietnam War.

From 1956 onwards, Navy Skyhawks were the first aircraft to be deployed outside of the U.S. armed with the AIM-9 Sidewinder. On strike missions, the Skyhawk&#x27;s normal role, air-to-air armaments were used for self-defense. In the early to mid-1960s, standard U.S. Navy A-4B Skyhawk squadrons were assigned to provide fighter protection for anti-submarine warfare aircraft operating from some &quot;Essex&quot;-class anti-submarine warfare carriers; these aircraft retained their ground- and sea-attack capabilities. The A-4B lacked an air-to-air radar, and it required visual identification of targets and guidance from either ships or an airborne Grumman E-1 Tracer AEW aircraft.

Lightweight and safer to land on smaller decks, Skyhawks would later also play a similar role flying from Australian, Argentinean, and Brazilian upgraded World War II surplus light ASW carriers, which were unable to operate most large modern fighters. Primary air-to-air armament consisted of the internal 20 mm (.79 in) Colt cannons and ability to carry an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile on both underwing hardpoints, later additions of two more underwing hardpoints on some aircraft made for a total capacity of four AAMs.
The first combat loss of an A-4 occurred on 5 August 1964, when Lieutenant junior grade Everett Alvarez, of VA-144 aboard , was shot down while attacking enemy torpedo boats in North Vietnam. Alvarez safely ejected after being hit by anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) fire, and became the first U.S. Naval POW of the war. He was released as a POW on 12 February 1973. The last A-4 loss in the Vietnam War occurred on 26 September 1972, when USMC pilot Captain James P. Walsh, USMC of VMA-211, flying close air support from Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, was hit by ground fire during the Battle of An Lộc. Captain Walsh ejected safely and was the last U.S. Marine to be taken prisoner during the war. He was released as a POW on 12 February 1973.

Although the first A-4Es were flown in Vietnam in early 1965, the A-4Cs continued to be used until late 1970. On 1 June 1965, the Chu Lai Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) was officially opened with the arrival of eight Skyhawks from Cubi Point, Philippine Islands. The group landed with the aid of arresting cables, refueled and took off with the aid of JATO, with fuel and bombs to support Marine combat units. The Skyhawks were from Marine Attack Squadron VMA-225 and VMA-311.

Lieutenant commander Michael J. Estocin of Attack Squadron 192 was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while flying surface-to-air missile (SAM) suppression during coordinated strikes against targets in Haiphong, North Vietnam, on 20 April and 26 April 1967.
On 29 July 1967, the aircraft carrier was conducting combat operations in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. A Zuni rocket misfired, striking an external tank on an A-4. Fuel from the leaking tank caught fire, creating a massive conflagration that burned for hours, killing 134 sailors, and injuring 161.

During the conflict, 362 A-4/TA-4F Skyhawks were lost due to all causes. The U.S. Navy lost 271 A-4s, the U.S. Marine Corps lost 81 A-4s and 10 TA-4Fs. A total of 32 A-4s were lost to surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and one A-4 was lost in aerial combat to a MiG-17 on 25 April 1967.

====Training and adversary role====
The Skyhawk, in the two-seat TA-4J configuration, was introduced to a training role replacing the TF-9J Cougar. The TA-4J served as the advanced jet trainer in white and orange markings for decades until being replaced by the T-45 Goshawk. Additional TA-4Js were assigned to Instrument Training RAGs at all the Navy master jet bases under RCVW-12 and RCVW-4. The Instrument RAGs initially provided jet transition training for Naval Aviators during the time period when Naval Aviation still had a great number of propeller-driven aircraft and also provided annual instrument training and check rides for Naval Aviators. The assigned TA-4J models were installed with collapsible hoods so the aviator under training had to demonstrate instrument flying skills without any outside reference. These units were VF-126 at NAS Miramar, California; VA-127 (later VFA-127; NAS FALLON, NV) at NAS Lemoore, California; VF-43 at NAS Oceana, Virginia; and VA-45 (later VF-45) at NAS Cecil Field, Florida until its later move to NAS Key West, Florida.
Additional single-seat Skyhawks were also assigned to composite squadrons (VC) worldwide to provide training and other services to deployed units. These included VC-1 at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii; VC-7 at NAS Miramar, California; VC-5 at NAS Cubi Point, Philippines; VC-8 at NS Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; VC-10 at NAVBASE Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Naval Reserve squadrons VC-12 (later VFC-12) at NAS Oceana, Virginia and VC-13 (later VFC-13) at NAS Miramar, California until its later move to NAS Fallon, Nevada.

With renewed emphasis on Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) training brought on with the establishment of the Navy Fighter Weapons School (&quot;TOPGUN&quot;) in 1969, the availability of Skyhawks in both the Instrument RAGs and Composite Squadrons at the master jet bases presented a ready resource of the nimble Skyhawks that had become the TOPGUN preferred surrogate for the MiG-17. At the time, the F-4 Phantom was just beginning to be exploited to its full potential as a fighter and had not performed as well as expected against the smaller North Vietnamese MiG-17 and MiG-21 opponents. TOPGUN introduced the notion of dissimilar air combat training (DACT) using modified A-4E/Fs. Modified aircraft, called &quot;Mongoose&quot;, lost the dorsal hump, the 20 mm cannon with their ammo systems, and the external stores, although sometimes the centerline station was kept. The slats were fixed.

The small size of the Skyhawk and superb low speed handling in the hands of a well trained aviator made it ideal to teach fleet aviators the finer points of DACT. The squadrons eventually began to display vivid threat type paint schemes signifying their transition into the primary role of Adversary training. To better perform the Adversary role, single-seat A-4E and F models were introduced to the role, but the ultimate adversary Skyhawk was the Super Fox, which was equipped with the uprated J52-P-408 engine. This variant had entered service in 1974 with VA-55/VA-164/VA-212 on the final USS &quot;Hancock&quot; cruise and had been the variant that the Blue Angels had selected in 1973.

The surplus of former USMC Skyhawks resulted in A-4M versions being used by both VF-126 and TOPGUN. Even though the A-4 was augmented by the F-5E, F-21 (Kfir), F-16, and F/A-18 in the adversary role, the A-4 remained a viable threat surrogate until it was retired by VF-43 in 1993 and shortly thereafter by VFC-12. The last A-4 fleet operators were VC-8, which retired its Skyhawks in 2003.

The A-4M was also operated by the Operations Maintenance Detachment (OMD) in an adversary role based at NAS Dallas, Texas for the Naval Air Reserve. Many of the aviators that flew the four jets were attached to NAS Dallas, including the Commanding Officer of the air station. The aircraft were instrumental in training and development of ACM for Naval Air Reserve fighter squadrons VF-201 and VF-202 flying the F-4 Phantom II and later the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. The unit also completed several missions involving target towing to NAS Key West, Florida; NAS Kingsville, Texas, and deployments to NAS Miramar, California and NAS Fallon, Nevada for adversary support. The detachment was under the operational command of the Commander Fleet Logistics Support Wing (CFLSW), also based at NAS Dallas.

===Israel===
Israel was the largest export customer for the Skyhawk. The first Israeli request for the type was issued in 1964; it would not be until February 1966 that the U.S. agreed to supply Skyhawks under certain conditions. The U.S. gradually provided numerous conventional munitions to arm the aircraft with, but was initially limited, refusing to supply cluster bombs or napalm. The Skyhawk became the first U.S. warplane to be offered to the Israeli Air Force (IAF), marking the point where the U.S took over France as Israel&#x27;s chief military supplier. Deliveries began after the Six-Day War, and A-4s soon formed the backbone of the IAF&#x27;s ground-attack force. In IAF service, the Skyhawk was named as the &quot;Ayit&quot; ( for Eagle).
The aircraft had a relatively low cost, a quarter of what a Phantom II cost, while carrying half of its payload. Israel purchased 217 A-4s, plus another 46 that were transferred from U.S. units in Operation Nickel Grass to compensate for large losses during the Yom Kippur War. The first deliveries took place in December 1967. Skyhawks promptly began to replace Dassault Ouragan and Dassault Mystère IV in IAF service, providing greater speed, range, and lift capacity in comparison to these older types. The first combat mission took place on 15 February 1968, attacking artillery and military bases along the border with Jordan.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, IAF Skyhawks were the primary ground attack aircraft in the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. During July 1969, in response to Egyptian shelling of Israeli positions in the Sinai Peninsula, air strikes were conducted against Egyptian missile sites. On 6 February 1970, Skyhawks attacked the Egyptian port of Gardaka, sinking a minelayer as a result. Furthermore, skirmishes between IAF Skyhawks and Arab aircraft of various sorts frequently occurred. In May 1970, an Israeli Skyhawk piloted by Col. Ezra Dotan shot down two MiG-17s over south Lebanon (one with unguided rockets, the other with 30 mm cannon fire) even though the Skyhawk&#x27;s head-up display had no &quot;air-to-air mode&quot;. However, up to three Skyhawks were downed by Egyptian MiG-21s, plus two were downed by Soviet-piloted MiG-21s during the War of Attrition.
During the Yom Kippur War, IAF Skyhawks carried out numerous bombing missions, flying a considerable proportion of the tactical sorties made throughout the conflict. The vast majority of losses incurred were from surface to air missiles (SAMs); as many of 30 IAF aircraft were lost in a single day while resisting Egyptian and Syrian advances. To counter the radar-guided SAM threat, the Skyhawk&#x27;s air brakes were used as improvised chaff dispensers. Improvements in tactics, such as the adoption of toss-bombing attacks, were also adopted in the latter part of the conflict. ACIG.org claims that at least nine Skyhawks were downed by MiG-21 and MiG-17 fighters during the Yom Kippur War. Formal Israeli sources claim only five IAF aircraft of any type were shot down in air-to-air duels.

A special version of the A-4 was developed for the IAF, the A-4H. This was an A-4E which featured improved avionics and the improved thrust J52-P-8A engine. Armament consisted of twin DEFA 30 mm cannon in place of the Colt Mk.12 20 mm cannons. Later modifications included the avionics hump and an extended tailpipe. The extended tailpipe gave greater protection against heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles. A total of 90 A-4Hs were delivered. In early 1973, the improved A-4N Skyhawk for Israel entered service, based on the A-4M models used by the U.S. Marine Corps. The different model Skyhawks carried out bombing missions in the Yom Kippur War, and a considerable proportion of the tactical sorties. They also attacked in Operation Peace for the Galilee, and one of them shot down a Syrian MiG-17.
The IAF also operated two-seat models, for operations as well as advanced training and retraining. The first training models arrived in 1967, with the first batch of Skyhawks. During the Yom Kippur War, the Skyhawk order of battle was reinforced with TA-4F and TA-4J models. In January 2003, the IAF selected RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. to upgrade its A-4 trainer fleet with weapon delivery, navigation and training systems. Integration of a multifunction and Head-up Display produced an advanced Lead in fighter trainer for the IAF&#x27;s future fighter pilots.

According to acig.org, Syria claimed that two Israeli Skyhawks were downed by Syrian MiG-23s over northern Lebanon on 26 April 1981. However, official IAF statistics do not list any downing of Israeli warplanes since the Yom Kippur War, and no loss of aircraft was reported on that date.

During the 1982 Lebanon War, an Israeli A-4 piloted by Aharon Achiaz was shot down over Lebanon by a SA-7 on 6 June 1982. Israel reported this was one of its only two fixed-wing aircraft shot down over the Beqaa Valley during air battles spanning from 6 June 1982 to 11 June 1982 where 150 aircraft took part, including the battle on 9 June 1982 known as Operation Mole Cricket 19.

In October 2008, it was decided that, due to maintenance issues, the Skyhawk fleet would be withdrawn and replaced by more modern aircraft, able to perform equally well in the training role and, if required, close support and interdiction missions on the battlefield. Some of Israel&#x27;s A-4s were later exported to Indonesia. The Skyhawks have been replaced by F-16s in combat roles but are still used for pilot training. All the remaining A-4s were to be fully phased out beginning by 2014 as the IAF accepts delivery of Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master jets. Skyhawks were last used in combat operations in the Israeli air force in 2012, when they dropped leaflets over Gaza.

In July 2013, Israel began a program called &quot;Teuza&quot; (boldness) for the purpose of turning some military bases into sales lots for obsolete IDF equipment. Older models that are not suited for Israel&#x27;s modern high-tech forces will be sold off, or sold for scrap if there are no buyers. Skyhawks are among those being offered.

On 13 December 2015, all remaining IAF Skyhawks were retired from service. The retirement ceremony took place at Hatzerim IDF base.

===Argentina===
Argentina was the first foreign user of the Skyhawk and had nearly 130 A-4s delivered since 1965. The Argentine Air Force received 25 A-4Bs in 1966 and another 25 in 1970, all refurbished in the United States by Lockheed Service Co. prior to their delivery as &quot;A-4P&quot;, although they were still locally known as &quot;A-4B&quot;. They had three weapon pylons and served in the 5th Air Brigade (). During 1976, 25 A-4Cs were ordered to replace the North American F-86 Sabres still in service in the 4th Air Brigade (). They were received &quot;as is&quot; and refurbished to flight status by Air Force technicians at Río Cuarto, Córdoba. The C model had five weapon pylons and could use AIM-9B Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.
The Argentine Naval Aviation also bought the Skyhawk known as &quot;A-4Q&quot; in the form of 16 A-4Bs in 1972, which unlike the Air Force&#x27;s A-4Ps, were powered by J-65-W-20 engines and fitted to use Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. They were received in 1972 to be used mainly from the aircraft carrier ARA &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; by the 3rd Fighter/Attack Squadron (). The first combat use of Argentina&#x27;s Skyhawks took place amid a military revolt during December 1975, performing a single strike against rebels in Buenos Aires.

The U.S. placed an embargo of spare parts in 1977 due to the Dirty War, backing the Humphrey-Kennedy amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1976, the Carter administration placed an embargo on the sale of arms and spare parts to Argentina and on the training of its military personnel (which was lifted in the 1990s under Carlos Menem&#x27;s presidency when Argentina became a major non-NATO ally). Ejection seats did not work and there were many other mechanical faults. In spite of this, A-4s were still active during the 1982 Falklands War.

====Falklands War====

During the 1982 Falklands War, Argentina deployed 48 Skyhawks (26 A-4B, 12 A-4C and 10 A-4Q aircraft). Armed with unguided bombs and lacking any electronic or missile self-defense, the Skyhawk could not effectively dogfight with Fleet Air Arm (FAA) British Aerospace Sea Harriers. Despite this, Argentine Air Force Skyhawks conducted numerous bombing missions against Royal Navy vessels, sinking the Type 42 destroyer and inflicted a variety of damage on several others: Type 21 frigate (subsequently sunk during attempted disposal of unexploded bombs), RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; (subsequently scuttled as a war grave), Type 42 , , Type 22 frigate , and RFA &quot;Sir Tristram&quot;.

Argentine Navy A-4Qs, flying from Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego naval air station, also played a role in the bombing attacks against British ships, destroying the Type 21 .

In all, 22 Skyhawks (10 A-4Bs, nine A-4Cs, and three A-4Qs) were lost to all causes in the six-week-long war. These losses included eight to FAA Sea Harriers, seven to ship-launched surface-to-air missiles, four to ground-launched surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft fire (including one to &quot;friendly fire&quot;), and three to crashes. According to aviation author Jim Winchester, the Skyhawk was the most effective Argentine aircraft of the conflict.

==== Postwar ====
After the war, Argentine Air Force A-4Ps and A-4Cs survivors were upgraded under the &quot;Halcón&quot; (Spanish for &quot;falcon&quot;) program with DEFA cannons, air-to-air missiles, and other minor details, and merged into the 5th Air Brigade. All of these were withdrawn from service in 1999, and they were replaced with 36 of the much-improved Lockheed Martin OA/A-4AR Fightinghawk (rebuilt and modernised ex USMC A-4M). Several TA-4J and A-4E airframes were also delivered under the A-4AR program, mainly for spare parts use. The A-4AR was in service between the late 1990s and 2016 when the majority of the fleet was grounded for serviceability and age. A small number of airframes remained in service for limited roles. Three aircraft were lost to accidents.

In 1983, the United States vetoed the delivery by Israel of 24 A-4Hs for the Argentine Navy as the A-4Q replacement. The A-4Qs were finally retired in 1988.

===Kuwait===
During November 1974, the Kuwaiti government announced its intention to purchase 36 new-build Skyhawks, along with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, support apparatus, and spares in exchange for $250 million. The majority of aircraft were supplied as single-seat A-4KUs while a handful of twin-seat TA-4KUs were also procured. By the end of 1978, all aircraft had been delivered and entered service with the Kuwaiti Air Force. During 1984, Kuwait reportedly put its Skyhawk fleet up for sale, but none were actually sold around this time.
In 1991, Kuwaiti Skyhawks participated in Operation Desert Storm. When Iraq invaded Kuwait, all available Skyhawks conducted attack missions against the advancing Iraqi forces, being operated from deserted roads after their bases were overrun; numerous Iraqi assault helicopters were destroyed by the Skyhawks prior to their withdrawal. As many as five aircraft were captured on the ground by Iraqi forces. Twenty-four of the 29 A-4KUs that remained in service with Kuwait escaped to Saudi Arabia. These Skyhawks (along with escaped Dassault Mirage F1s) operated as the &quot;Free Kuwait Air Force&quot;, flying 1,361 sorties during the liberation of Kuwait. Twenty-three A-4s survived the conflict and the Iraqi invasion, with only one A-4KU (KAF-828, BuNo. 160207) shot down by Iraqi radar-guided SAM on 17 January 1991. The pilot, Mohammed Mubarak, ejected and was taken prisoner.

During the early 1990s, as Kuwait awaited delivery of more capable McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, protracted efforts were made to sell its remaining Skyhawks. Assisted by the U.S. State Department, fruitless negotiations took place with both Bosnia and the Philippines; in 1998, the fleet was sold to Brazil, where they served aboard the aircraft carrier NAe &quot;São Paulo&quot; prior to its decommissioning in February 2017.

===Australia===
Twenty A-4G Skyhawks were purchased by the Royal Australian Navy for operation from . The aircraft were acquired in two batches of 10, in 1967 and 1971, and were primarily used to provide air defence for the fleet. Ten of the A-4Gs were destroyed in accidents, and all the survivors were sold to the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1984.

===New Zealand===
During the 1960s, New Zealand considered various aircraft types, such as the Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter and the F-4 Phantom II, before choosing to order 14 Skyhawks for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) under a $23 million deal for the aircraft themselves, spare parts, support, and initial training. In 1970, 10 single-seat A-4Ks and 4 TA-4Ks were delivered to the RNZAF, joining No. 75 Squadron. Various early modifications were made, including the adoption of a cranked aerial refueling probe in place of the straight counterpart initially used. Various overseas deployments, often to conduct ANZUS exercises, were conducted by the Skyhawk fleet throughout the 1970s and 1980s, often being escorted by up to three C-130 Hercules transport planes (carrying spares, support equipment, and ground crew) and a P-3 Orion to assist in navigation and communication.

In 1983, additional Skyhawks were acquired in the form of 8 A-4Gs and 2 TA-4Gs from the Royal Australian Navy in 1984, which allowed a second Skyhawk-equipped squadron, No. 2 Squadron, to be formed. During 1986, Project Kahu was launched to upgrade the RNZAF&#x27;s Skyhawks with new avionics, including an AN/APG-66 NZ radar based on that used by the F-16, and weapons, as a lower-cost alternative to buying new replacements. All 10 ex-RAN and the 12 surviving original RNZAF aircraft were converted to the A-4K Kahu standard. In addition to its primary duties, the type became heavily involved in training not just for the RNZAF but also RAN, the latter financially contributing to their operating costs through the 1990s as a result.

During 2001, the three Air Combat Force squadrons (Nos. 2, 14, and 75) were disbanded and the Skyhawks put into storage awaiting sale. They were maintained, with occasional servicing flights, and then moved to RNZAF Base Woodbourne, where they were preserved in protective latex. Draken International signed an agreement with the New Zealand government in 2012 to purchase eight A-4Ks and associated equipment for its adversary training services. Six were former RAN A-4G airframes which as carrier aircraft had logged significantly fewer flying hours. These were subsequently relocated to the U.S. at Draken&#x27;s Lakeland Linder International Airport facility in Lakeland, Florida. The other A-4K aircraft were given to museums in New Zealand and Australia.

===Indonesia===
Due to the declining relationship between Indonesia and the Soviet Union after the events of G30S, there was a lack of spare parts for military hardware supplied by the Communist Bloc. As a consequence, many of the Indonesian Air Force&#x27;s modern combat aircraft, such as its MiGs and bomber fleet consisting of Il-28 Beagles and Tu-16 Badgers, were effectively inoperable by the early 1970s, and were subsequently grounded. During May 1978, U.S. vice-president Walter Mondale offered 16 Skyhawks to Indonesia; during the following year, Indonesian proceeded to acquire Skyhawks via a covert, joint operation with Israel. The operation was done confidentially because the two countries had no official diplomatic relations. These A-4s were chosen because the IDF were planning to retire its A-4 squadrons. Some of the Israeli-built avionics were stripped from the aircraft prior to being transferred. 

During 1982, an additional 15 Skyhawks were purchased directly from U.S. stocks, undergoing refurbishment prior to delivery under a $27 million deal. Several more twin-seat Skyhawks were procured during the 1990s. Two squadrons operated the A-4 Skyhawks, the 11th Air Squadron at Iswahjudi Air Force Base in East Java and 12th Air Squadron at Roesmin Nurjadin Air Force Base in Riau.

A flight of four A-4 Skyhawks were deployed to East Timor for counter-insurgency operations in a six months combat tour between 1985–1986. During the deployment, they were based at Baucau Airport. The Skyhawks were mostly armed with 500 lbs (230 kg) Mark 82 bombs. On 2 November 1987, the Indonesian Air Force launched a long-range strike mission against targets in East Timor using the Skyhawks. A flight of five A-4s, each armed with six 500 lbs Mark 82 bombs, two LAU-68 rocket pods, and two external fuel tanks, departed Iswahjudi Air Force Base in East Java for two and a half hour flight to East Timor. The flight was supported by a KC-130B Hercules for aerial refueling. The five A-4s attacked 30 designated targets in the Eastern Sector near Baucau, and then landed at Baucau Airport.

By 1999, there were only 19 aircraft left operational, partially due to a lack of spare parts. The arrival of Sukhoi Su-27s during 2003 quickly led to the withdrawal of the Indonesian Air Force&#x27;s remaining Skyhawks. On 5 August 2004, three A-4 Skyhawks with tail numbers TT-0431, TT-0440, and TL-0416 from 11th Air Squadron, based at Sultan Hasanuddin Air Force Base in Makassar, flew in the skies of Indonesia for the last time with the destination of Adisutjipto Air Force Base, Yogyakarta. Today, a sizeable number of the A-4s are preserved as museum pieces, monuments, or gate guardians; for example one is displayed in Satria Mandala Military Museum, and the other in the Dirgantara Mandala Air Force Museum.

===Malaysia===
In 1982, Malaysia purchased 80 refurbished A-4C and A-4L under a modernization program called PERISTA. Forty of the airframes were upgraded with the Hughes AN/ASB-19 Angle Rate Bombing System, air refueling capability, and increased payload, while the rest were kept in the U.S. as a reserve and as a source of spare parts. This modified version was redesignated as A-4PTM and were unique to Malaysia. Deliveries took place between 1984 and 1985.

The Skyhawks were operated by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), serving in the No.6 and No.9 RMAF Squadrons, based at Kuantan air base. During the late 1980s, Argentina attempted to barter for Skyhawks from Malaysia in exchange for FMA IA-63 Pampa aircraft and ground vehicles, but no such transaction took place. While in RMAF service, the type suffered from frequent maintenance issues and a high accident rate; it is believed that this contributed to the type&#x27;s relatively short service life. In 1995, the Skyhawk fleet was retired and remaining examples were stored outside, while the RMAF replaced the type with the BAE Systems Hawk. Malaysia reportedly expressed interest in acquiring Skyhawks from New Zealand during the 2000s.

===Brazil===
As of 2014, Brazil is the latest Skyhawk customer. In 1997, Brazil negotiated a $70 million (~$ in ) contract for purchase of 20 A-4KU and three TA-4KU Skyhawks from Kuwait. Kuwait&#x27;s Skyhawks, modified A-4Ms and TA-4Js delivered in 1977, were among the last of those models built by Douglas. The aircraft were selected by Brazil because of their low flight time, excellent physical condition, and a favorable price. The Brazilian Navy re-designated AF-1 and AF-1A Falcões (Hawks), the Kuwaiti Skyhawks arrived in Arraial do Cabo on 5 September 1998.

On 18 January 2001, an AF-1 trapped aboard the Brazilian aircraft carrier was later successfully catapulted, making Brazil&#x27;s fixed-wing carrier force operational again after nearly two decades. To replace the aging &quot;Minas Gerais&quot;, Brazil purchased the surplus on 15 November 2001. Renamed , the &quot;new&quot; carrier received extensive refitting before becoming operational during 2003. &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was decommissioned that same year and later put up for sale.

On 14 April 2009, Embraer signed a contract to modernize 12 Brazilian Navy aircraft, nine AF-1s (single-seat) and three AF-1As (two-seat), with the aim of restoring the operating capacity of the Navy 1st Intercept and Attack Plane Squadron. The program includes restoring the aircraft and their current systems, as well as implementing new avionics, radar, power production, and autonomous oxygen generating systems. The first of the 12 modified Skyhawks was delivered on 27 May 2015. Embraer stated the modifications will allow the aircraft to remain operational until 2025.

In 2017, the Brazilian Navy indicated that it was reconsidering the total number of aircraft to be modernized to AF-1B/C standard due to budget constraints and the decommissioning of the &quot;São Paulo&quot;. Two AF-1Bs were delivered in 2015 and a further two of undisclosed type are to be delivered in 2017. It is believed that despite the loss of its only carrier, the Navy wants to retain the experience of carrier-based operations, and thus will not rescind the contract outright. As of 2022, there are 3 A-4s in service, with 3 used for training and the other aircraft on display.

===Others===
Top Aces, formerly Discovery Air Defense Services, a private Canadian company contracted by the Canadian Armed Forces, Australian Defence Force, and Bundeswehr to provide air combat and fighter training, imported and registered ten A-4N and TA-4J aircraft. Discovery upgraded and modified the jets to be capable of Electronic Warfare training. Top Aces also operates A-4Ns under contract for training of the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr). Another major civil user of A-4s for training support to military forces is US-based Draken International, which operates ex-New Zealand A-4Ks as part of a diverse fleet of jets. A-4s have previously been operated in the target support role in Germany by Tracor Flight Systems.

<doc id="439931" wikidata="Q203722" url="?curid=439931" title="Jordanian dinar">
<text>The Jordanian dinar (; code: JOD; unofficially abbreviated as JD) has been the currency of Jordan since 1950. The dinar is divided into 100 qirsh (also called piastres) or 1000 fulus. Fils are effectively obsolete; however, monetary amounts are still written to three decimal places representing fils. It is pegged to the US dollar.

The Central Bank of Jordan commenced operations in 1964 and became the sole issuer of Jordanian currency, in place of the Jordan Currency Board.

The Jordanian dinar is also widely used in the West Bank alongside the Israeli shekel.

==History==
In 1927, the British administration of the Palestinian Mandate established the Palestine Currency Board which issued the Palestine pound which was the official currency in both Mandatory Palestine and the Emirate of Transjordan. Though Jordan became an independent kingdom on 25 May 1946, it continued to use the Palestinian pound for a while. In 1949, it passed the Provisional Act No. 35 of 1949, which established the Jordan Currency Board as the sole authority in the kingdom entitled to issue Jordanian currency, called the Jordanian dinar. The Board was based in London and consisted of a president and four members, and began issuing Jordanian dinars in 1949 and was exchangeable for Palestinian pounds at parity.

After Jordanian occupation of the West Bank in April 1950, the dinar replaced the Palestinian pound. On 1 July 1950, the Jordanian dinar became the kingdom&#x27;s official currency and legal tender. The use of the Palestine pound ceased in the country on 30 September 1950. The Central Bank of Jordan was established in 1959 and took over note production in 1964. In 1967, Jordan lost control of the West Bank, but the Jordanian dinar continued to be used there. It continues to be widely used in the West Bank alongside the Israeli shekel.

In 1988 and 1989, the dinar depreciated substantially due to mounting foreign debts in the kingdom. During that time, there were protests across the country.

==Coins==
Coins were introduced in 1949 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 fils. The first issue of 1 fils were mistakenly minted with the denomination given as &quot;1 fil&quot;. 20 fils coins were minted until 1965, with 25 fils introduced in 1968 and dinar coins in 1970. The 1 fils coin was last minted in 1985. In 1996, smaller dinar coins were introduced alongside and 1 dinar coins.

Until 1992, coins were denominated in Arabic using fils, qirsh, dirham and dinar but in English only in fils and dinar. Since 1992, the fils and dirham are no longer used in the Arabic and the English denominations are given in dinar and either qirsh or piastres.

# &quot;rub&#x27;a&quot; is Arabic for &quot;piece of four&quot; or &quot;quarter&quot;.
# &quot;nusf&quot; is Arabic for &quot;piece of two&quot; or &quot;half&quot;.

==Banknotes==
The Central Bank of Jordan is the sole authority to issue Jordanian banknotes since its establishment in 1964. It released into circulation its first series of Jordanian notes on August 4, 1965. From 1949 to 1965, currency issue was entrusted in the Jordan Currency Board. Before 1949, the Palestinian pound was used.

In 1949, banknotes were issued by the Jordan Currency Board in denominations of , 1, 5, 10 and 50 dinars. They bore the country&#x27;s official name, &quot;The Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan&quot;. 20 dinar notes were introduced in 1977. The 50 dinar note was redesigned and the dinar notes were replaced by coins in 1999.

==Fixed exchange rate==
Since October 23, 1995, the dinar has officially been pegged to the IMF&#x27;s special drawing rights (SDRs), while in practice it was fixed at 1 U.S. dollar = 0.709 dinar most of the time, which is approximately 1 dinar = 1.41044 dollars. The Central Bank buys U.S. dollars at 0.708 dinar per dollar, and sells U.S. dollars at 0.710 dinar per dollar.

<doc id="439958" wikidata="Q2615692" url="?curid=439958" title="Securities and Exchange Board of India">
<text>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the regulatory body for securities and commodity market in India under the administrative domain of Ministry of Finance within the Government of India. It was established on 12 April 1988 as an executive body and was given statutory powers on 30 January 1992 through the SEBI Act, 1992.

== History ==
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was first established in 1988 as a non-statutory body for regulating the securities market. Before it came into existence, the Controller of Capital Issues was the market&#x27;s regulatory authority, and derived power from the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947. SEBI became an autonomous body on 30 January 1992 and was accorded statutory powers with the passing of the SEBI Act, 1992 by the Parliament of India. It has its headquarters at the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai and has Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Regional Offices in New Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, and Ahmedabad, respectively. Up until June 2023, it also had 17 local offices spread all over India to promote investor education; however, 16 of them were closed as part of a restructuring exercise.

SEBI is managed by its board of members, which consist of the following people:
* The chairman, who is nominated by the Union Government of India.
* Two members from the Union Finance Ministry.
* One member from the Reserve Bank of India.
* The remaining five members are nominated by the Union Government of India, and out of them at least three should be whole-time members.

After the amendment of 1999, collective investment schemes were brought under SEBI except nidhis, chit funds and cooperatives.

== Organisation structure ==

Tuhin Kanta Pandey took charge as Chairman on 1 March 2025, replacing Madhabi Puri Buch , whose term ended on 28 February 2025. 

===Current Board members===
The board comprises:
===List of Chairpersons===
List of Chairperson:
==National Apex Bodies==

*National Institute of Securities Markets of India

== Functions and responsibilities ==
The Preamble of the Securities and Exchange Board of India describes the basic functions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India as &quot;...to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market and for matters connected there with or incidental there to&quot;.

SEBI has to be responsive to the needs of three groups, which constitute the market:
* issuers of securities
* investors
* market intermediaries

SEBI has three powers rolled into one body: quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial and quasi-executive. It drafts regulations in its legislative capacity, it conducts investigation and enforcement action in its executive function and it passes rulings and orders in its judicial capacity. Though this makes it very powerful, there is an appeal process to create accountability. There is a Securities Appellate Tribunal which is a three-member tribunal and is currently headed by Justice Tarun Agarwala, former Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court. A second appeal lies directly to the Supreme Court. SEBI has taken a very proactive role in streamlining disclosure requirements to international standards. 

=== Powers ===
For the discharge of its functions efficiently, SEBI has been vested with the following powers:
* to approve by−laws of Securities exchanges.
* to require the Securities exchange to amend their by−laws.
* inspect the books of accounts and call for periodical returns from recognised Securities exchanges.
* inspect the books of accounts of financial intermediaries.
* compel certain companies to list their shares in one or more Securities exchanges.
* registration of Brokers and sub-brokers.
* eliminate malpractices in security market. 

SEBI committees

* Technical Advisory Committee
* Committee for review of structure of infrastructure institutions
* Advisory Committee for the SEBI Investor Protection and Education Fund
* Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee
* Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC)
* Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC)
* Mutual Fund Advisory Committee
* Corporate Bonds &amp; Securitisation Advisory Committee

There are two types of brokers:
*Discount brokers
*Merchant brokers

== Major achievements ==

SEBI has enjoyed success as a regulator by pushing systematic reforms aggressively and successively. It is credited for quick movement towards making the markets electronic and paperless by introducing the T+5 rolling cycle in July 2001, the T+3 in April 2002, and the T+2 in April 2003. The rolling cycle of T+2 means that settlement is done in 2 days after trade date. SEBI has also been active in setting up the regulations as required under law. It did away with physical certificates that were prone to postal delays, theft and forgery, apart from making the settlement process slow and cumbersome, by passing the Depositories Act, 1996.

SEBI has also been instrumental in taking quick and effective steps in light of the global meltdown and the Satyam fiasco. In October 2011, it increased the extent and quantity of disclosures to be made by Indian corporate promoters. In light of the global meltdown, it liberalized the takeover code to facilitate investments by removing regulatory structures. In one such move, SEBI has increased the application limit for retail investors to from at present.

On the occasion of World Investor Week 2022, SEBI Executive Director Shri G. P. Garg launched a book on Financial Literacy. This book is a joint effort between Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India Limited and CASI New York.

== Criticism and controversies == 

Supreme Court of India heard a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by India Rejuvenation Initiative that had challenged the procedure for key appointments adopted by Govt of India. The petition alleged that, &quot;The constitution of the search-cum-selection committee for recommending the name of chairman and every whole-time members of SEBI for appointment has been altered, which directly impacted its balance and could compromise the role of the SEBI as a watchdog.&quot; On 21 November 2011, the court allowed petitioners to withdraw the petition and file a fresh petition pointing out constitutional issues regarding appointments of regulators and their independence. The Chief Justice of India refused the finance ministry&#x27;s request to dismiss the PIL and said that the court was well aware of what was going on in SEBI. Hearing a similar petition filed by Bengaluru-based advocate Anil Kumar Agarwal, a two judge Supreme Court bench of Justice Surinder Singh Nijjar and Justice HL Gokhale issued a notice to the Govt of India, SEBI chief UK Sinha and Omita Paul, Secretary to the President of India.

Further, it came into light that Dr. K. M. Abraham(the then whole time member of SEBI Board) had written to the Prime Minister about malaise in SEBI. He said, &quot;The regulatory institution is under duress and under severe attack from powerful corporate interests operating concertedly to undermine SEBI&quot;. He specifically said that Finance Minister&#x27;s office, and especially his advisor Omita Paul, were trying to influence many cases before SEBI, including those relating to Sahara Group, Reliance, Bank of Rajasthan and MCX.

===Regulatory failure, inaction, and incompetence=== 
Several major financial scams have shaken the Indian market, like the Satyam scam, IL&amp;FS crisis, Punjab National Bank Scam, and NSE co-location scam Critics argue that SEBI failed to properly monitor these companies or take timely action when irregularities were noticed. There have been instances where market intermediaries engaged in fraudulent activities, which resulted in significant losses for investors. SEBI’s monitoring of these intermediaries has been called into question. SEBI has been criticized for its inability to effectively regulate and prevent insider trading, despite having regulations in place. There have been numerous cases where insider trading went undetected for long periods. Some believe SEBI hasn&#x27;t done enough to prevent companies from issuing IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) at inflated prices, which hurts regular investors.

Market manipulation is an ongoing concern in the Indian stock market, particularly with small-cap and mid-cap stocks, which are more susceptible due to lower trading volumes, less liquidity, and limited market analyst coverage. Pump and dump schemes are a prevalent form of manipulation, where false or misleading statements are used to inflate a stock’s price before the manipulators sell off their shares at a profit, leading to significant losses for unsuspecting investors.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been criticized for not being able to prevent such manipulations effectively. Reasons include limited resources, reliance on stock exchanges for market data, a lack of a comprehensive legal framework with stringent penalties, slow response times, and a lack of coordination with other regulatory bodies.

=== Hindenburg allegations ===
In August 2024, Hindenburg Research, a short-selling activist firm, accused SEBI Chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband of having a stake in offshore entities which invested money into India. They alleged that these same funds, managed by IIFL Wealth, were used by Vinod Adani to artificially inflate shares of companies owned by the Adani Group. This put Buch into the spotlight, since SEBI had previously faced difficulties in finding out the beneficial owners of similar off-shore funds that had invested in Adani companies. Adani Group calls the claims &quot;malicious, mischievous&quot;. India&#x27;s Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, asked Buch to resign.

Commentators say that while Hindenburg Research did not have compelling evidence of malfeasance, Puri Buch didn&#x27;t do enough to avoid entirely foreseeable conflict of interest allegations.

== Regional Securities exchanges ==
SEBI in its circular dated 30 May 2012 gave exit – guidelines for Securities exchanges. This was mainly due to illiquid nature of trade on many of 20+ regional Securities exchanges. It had asked many of these exchanges to either meet the required criteria or take a graceful exit. SEBI&#x27;s new norms for Securities exchanges mandates that it should have minimum net-worth of 1 billion and an annual trading of 10 billion. The Indian Securities market regulator SEBI had given the recognized Securities exchanges two years to comply or exit the business.

SEBI is cracking down on virtual stock gaming apps popular among retail investors for creating virtual portfolios and competing on real-time stock prices.

In May, 2024 Sebi started to allow Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) established in GIFT City to accept unlimited investments from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs). After this initiative, NRIs could own100% of a global fund set up at GIFT city which is a special economic zone in Gujrat. 

=== Process of de-recognition and exit ===
Following is an excerpt from the circular:

# Exchanges may seek exit through voluntary surrender of recognition.
# Securities where the annual trading turnover on its own platform is less than 10 billion can apply to SEBI for voluntary surrender of recognition and exit, at any time before the expiry of two years from the date of issuance of this Circular.
# If the Securities exchange is not able to achieve the prescribed turnover of 10 billion on continuous basis or does not apply for voluntary surrender of recognition and exit before the expiry of two years from the date of this Circular, SEBI shall proceed with compulsory de-recognition and exit of such Securities exchanges, in terms of the conditions as may be specified by SEBI.
# Securities Exchanges which are already de-recognised as on date, shall make an application for exit within two months from the date of this circular. Upon failure to do so, the de-recognised exchange shall be subject to compulsory exit process.

<doc id="439959" wikidata="Q344822" url="?curid=439959" title="Herb Alpert">
<text>Herb Alpert (born March 31, 1935) is an American trumpeter, pianist, songwriter, record producer, arranger, conductor, painter, sculptor and theatre producer, who led the band Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass (sometimes called &quot;Herb Alpert and the TJB&quot;) in the 1960s. During the same decade, he co-founded A&amp;M Records with Jerry Moss.

Alpert has recorded 28 albums that have appeared on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, five of which reached No. 1; he has been awarded 14 platinum albums and 15 gold albums. Alpert is the only musician to have reached No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as both a vocalist (&quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love with You&quot;, 1968) and as an instrumentalist (&quot;Rise&quot;, 1979).

Alpert has sold an estimated 72 million records worldwide. He has received many accolades, including a Tony Award and eight Grammy Awards, as well as the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2006, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Alpert was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Barack Obama in 2013.

==Early life and career==
Herb Alpert was born on March 31, 1935 and raised in the Boyle Heights section of Eastside Los Angeles, California. He was the youngest of three children (a daughter and two sons) born to Tillie (née Goldberg) and Louis Leib (or 
Louis Bentsion-Leib) Alpert. His parents were Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Radomyshl (in present-day Ukraine) and Romania.

Alpert was born into a family of musicians. His father, although a tailor by trade, was also a mandolin player. His mother taught violin at a young age, and his older brother, David, was a drummer. His sister Mimi, who was the oldest, played the piano. Alpert began to play trumpet at eight years old.

Alpert started attending Fairfax High School in Los Angeles beginning in 10th grade. In 11th grade (1952) he was a member of their gym team. One of his specialties was performing on the rings, but an appendectomy a week before a League Meet sidelined him. In his senior year (1953), he began focusing on his trumpet.

While attending the University of Southern California in the 1950s, he was a member of the USC Trojan Marching Band for two years. Alpert served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, and played in the 6th Army Band. In 1956, he appeared in an uncredited role as &quot;Drummer on Mt. Sinai&quot; in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.

In 1957, Alpert teamed up with Rob Weerts, another burgeoning lyricist, as a songwriter for Keen Records. A number of songs written or co-written by Alpert during the following two years became Top 20 hits, including &quot;Baby Talk&quot; by Jan and Dean and &quot;Wonderful World&quot; by Sam Cooke. In 1960, he began his recording career as a vocalist at RCA Records under the name of Dore Alpert. In 1962, Alpert and his new business partner Jerry Moss formed Carnival Records with &quot;Tell It to the Birds&quot; as its first release, distribution outside of Los Angeles being done by Dot Records. After Carnival released its second single &quot;Love Is Back In Style&quot; by Charlie Robinson, Alpert and Moss found that there was prior usage of the Carnival name and renamed their label A&amp;M Records.

==The Tijuana Brass years==
The song that jump-started Alpert&#x27;s performing career was originally titled &quot;Twinkle Star&quot;, written by Sol Lake (who would write many Tijuana Brass songs over the next decade). Alpert was dissatisfied with his first efforts to record the song, then took a break to visit a bullfight in Tijuana, Mexico. As Alpert later recounted, &quot;That&#x27;s when it hit me! Something in the excitement of the crowd, the traditional mariachi music, the trumpet call heralding the start of the fight, the yelling, the snorting of the bulls, it all clicked.&quot; Alpert adapted the tune to the trumpet style, mixed in crowd cheers and other noises for ambience, and renamed the song &quot;The Lonely Bull&quot;.

He personally funded the production of the record as a single, and it spread through radio DJs until it caught on and became a Top 10 hit in the fall of 1962. He followed up quickly with his debut album, &quot;The Lonely Bull&quot; by &quot;Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass&quot;. Originally the Tijuana Brass was just Alpert overdubbing his own trumpet, slightly out of sync.

It was A&amp;M&#x27;s first album (with the original release number being #101), although it was recorded for Conway Records. The title cut reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. For this album and subsequent releases, Alpert recorded with the group of Los Angeles session musicians known as the Wrecking Crew, whom he holds in high regard.
Alpert&#x27;s 1965 album &quot;Whipped Cream &amp; Other Delights&quot; proved so popular — it was the number one album of 1966, outselling The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, and The Rolling Stones — that Alpert had to turn the Tijuana Brass into an actual touring ensemble rather than a studio band. Some of that popularity might be attributable to the album&#x27;s notoriously racy cover, which featured model Dolores Erickson seemingly clothed only in whipped cream. However, as writer Bruce Handy pointed out in a &quot;Billboard&quot; article, two other Brass albums, &quot;Going Places&quot; (1965) and &quot;What Now My Love&quot; (1966), &quot;held the third and fifth spots on the 1966 year-end chart despite pleasant yet far more anodyne covers.&quot; Another measure of the band&#x27;s popularity is that a number of Tijuana Brass songs were used as theme music for years by the ABC TV game show &quot;The Dating Game&quot;.

In 1966, a short animated film by John and Faith Hubley called &quot;A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature&quot; was released; it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1967. The film featured two songs by the band, &quot;Tijuana Taxi&quot; and &quot;Spanish Flea&quot;. Also in 1967, the Tijuana Brass performed Burt Bacharach&#x27;s title cut to the first movie version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

Alpert&#x27;s only No. 1 single during this period, and the first No. 1 hit for his A&amp;M label, was a solo effort: &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love with You&quot;, written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, featuring a rare vocal. Alpert sang it to his first wife in a 1968 CBS Television special titled &quot;Beat of the Brass&quot;. The sequence was filmed on the beach in Malibu. The song was not intended to be released, but after it was used in the television special, allegedly thousands of telephone calls to CBS asking about it convinced Alpert to release it as a single, two days after the show aired. Although Alpert&#x27;s vocal skills and range were limited, the song&#x27;s technical demands suited him.

After years of success, Alpert had a personal crisis in 1969, declaring &quot;the trumpet is my enemy.&quot; He disbanded the Tijuana Brass, and stopped performing in public. Eventually he sought out teacher Carmine Caruso, &quot;who never played trumpet a day in his life, (but) he was a great trumpet teacher.&quot; &quot;What I found,&quot; Alpert told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;is that the thing in my hands is just a piece of plumbing. The real instrument is me, the emotions, not my lip, not my technique, but feelings I learned to stuff away—as a kid who came from a very unvocal household. Since then, I&#x27;ve been continually working it out, practicing religiously and now, playing better than ever.&quot; The results were noticeable; as Richard S. Ginell wrote in an AllMusic review of Alpert&#x27;s comeback album, &quot;You Smile - The Song Begins&quot;, &quot;His four-year sabbatical over, Herb Alpert returned to the studio creatively refreshed, his trumpet sounding more soulful and thoughtful, his ears attuned more than ever to jazz.&quot;

==Post-Brass musical career==

In 1979, five years after his last chart hit with the Tijuana Brass, Alpert tried to record a disco album of rearranged Brass hits. &quot;It just sounded awful to me,&quot; Alpert was quoted later. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want any part of it.&quot; But because the musicians were already booked, Alpert recorded other material, including the instrumental &quot;Rise&quot; (with initial version created by Alpert&#x27;s nephew, Randy &quot;Badazz&quot; Alpert and his close friend, musician Andy Armer). The song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after it was used repeatedly on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. The song also became a hit in the UK, but in a speeded-up version, due to British DJs not realizing that the American 12&quot; single was recorded at 33 rpm instead of 45 rpm.

In 2013, Alpert released &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;, which won a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Since that time, he has released several other albums, most recently &quot;50&quot; (claimed to be his 50th studio album) and has said he has plans for his next two LPs, one of which will be another Christmas album—his third.

In late 2024, Alpert announced that he was forming a new Tijuana Brass group and would do a tour in 2025, to celebrate the landmark &quot;Whipped Cream and Other Delights&quot; album. The tour is titled &quot;Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass &amp; Other Delights.&quot;

==A&amp;M Records==

On October 11, 1989, Philips subsidiary PolyGram announced its acquisition of A&amp;M Records for $500 million. Alpert and Moss later received an extra $200 million payment for PolyGram&#x27;s breach of the terms of the deal.

==Visual arts==
Alpert has a second career as an abstract expressionist painter and sculptor with group and solo exhibitions around the United States and Europe. The 2010 sculpture exhibition &quot;Herb Alpert: Black Totems&quot; in Beverly Hills brought media attention to his visual work. His 2013 exhibition in Santa Monica included both abstract paintings and large totemlike sculptures.

==Awards and honors==
In May 2000, Alpert was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music.

In 1977, for his contribution to the recording industry, Alpert was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6929 Hollywood Boulevard. 

At the 1997 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards Alpert received the El Premio &quot;Billboard&quot; award for his contributions to Latin music.

Alpert and Moss were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006, as non-performer lifetime achievers for their work at A&amp;M. 

Alpert was awarded the Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award by Society of Singers in 2009.

Alpert was awarded a 2012 National Medal of Arts award by Barack and Michelle Obama on Wednesday, July 10, 2013, in the White House&#x27;s East Room.

==Philanthropy==

In the 1980s Alpert created the Herb Alpert Foundation and the Alpert Awards in the Arts with the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts).

The foundation supports youth and arts education as well as environmental issues, and helps fund the PBS series &quot;Bill Moyers on Faith and Reason&quot; and later &quot;Moyers &amp; Company&quot;. 

Alpert and his wife donated $30 million to University of California, Los Angeles in 2007 to form and endow the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music as part of the restructured UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture. He donated $24 million, including $15 million from April 2008, to CalArts for its music curricula, and provided funding for the culture-jamming activists the Yes Men.

In 2012, the foundation granted more than $5 million to the Harlem School of the Arts, which allowed the school to retire its debt, restore its endowment and create a scholarship program for needy students. In 2013, the school&#x27;s building was renamed the Herb Alpert Center. In 2016, Alpert&#x27;s foundation also bestowed a $10.1 million donation to Los Angeles City College to provide music majors with a tuition-free education, the largest gift to an individual community college in the history of Southern California, and the second-largest gift in the history of the state. In 2020, Alpert bestowed an additional $9.7 million on the Harlem School of the Arts to upgrade its facility.

Alpert founded the Louis and Tillie Alpert Music Center in Jerusalem, which brings together both Arab and Jewish students.

==Business ventures==
In the late 1980s, Alpert started H. Alpert and Co., a short-lived perfume company, which sold products in high-end department stores such as Nordstrom. The company launched with two scents, Listen and Listen for Men. Alpert compared perfume to music, with high and low notes.

In partnership with his daughter Eden, in 2004 Alpert opened Vibrato, a jazz club and restaurant located in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.

== Documentaries ==
On September 17, 2010, the TV documentary &quot;Legends: Herb Alpert – Tijuana Brass and Other Delights&quot; premiered on BBC4.

In 2020, &quot;Herb Alpert Is...&quot;, a documentary written and directed by John Scheinfeld, was released.

==Personal life==
Alpert married Sharon Mae Lubin at Presidio of San Francisco in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspapers/77172652&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Dore (born 1960) and Eden (born 1966). The couple divorced in 1971. In 1973, Alpert married Lani Hall, once the lead singer of A&amp;M group Brasil &#x27;66. Alpert and Hall have a daughter, actress Aria Alpert, born in 1976. 

Hall and Alpert recorded a live album, &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, in 2009; a studio album, &quot;I Feel You&quot;, in 2011; and another studio album, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;, in 2013. An AllMusic review concluded: &quot;Ultimately, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; represents not just the third album in a trilogy, but a loving creative partnership that, for Alpert and Hall, spans a lifetime.&quot; As of 2025 the couple still performs together.

<text>Kociewie is an ethnocultural region in the eastern part of Tuchola Forest, in northern Poland, Pomerania, that is inhabited by the Kociewians. Its cultural capital is Starogard Gdański, the biggest town is Tczew, while other major towns include Świecie, and Pelplin. The region has about 250,000 inhabitants. It has well-developed industry and agriculture. Administratively, it is divided between the Pomeranian and Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeships.

Kociewie is bordered by the Chełmno Land in the south, Powiśle in the east, Kashubia and Żuławy Wiślane in the north, and other parts of historic Pomerania in the west.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===
The earliest inhabitants of what is now Kociewie are believed to have been from the Upper Paleolithic period. Evidence of the Linear Pottery culture has been unearthed in the region, and a neolithic settlement discovered at Barłożno. Archeological evidence from Tczew County indicates that the Kociewian lands were inhabited by people from the prehistoric Funnelbeaker culture. Later Iron Age settlements and cemeteries have also been uncovered in the same area.

=== Early history ===

The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century during the rule of Mieszko I. Within the Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth it formed part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship with the capital located in Skarszewy in Kociewie, and county seats located in Nowe, Skarszewy, Starogard, Świecie and Tczew. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there were instances of Scottish immigrants living in Gniew, Starogard Gdański and Tczew. In 1762–1765, Józef Wybicki, the author of the lyrics of the Polish national anthem, studied law at the court in Skarszewy. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the region was annexed by Prussia.

=== 19th century ===
The first known mention of the region in the historical record dates to 10 February 1807 when the name &quot;Gociewie&quot; was used in correspondence between Jan Henryk Dąbrowski and one of his Lieutenant colonels’ during the Greater Poland Uprising. Although, it is likely that the name Kociewie had been in use since the late Middle Ages.
In the mid-19 century the linguist Florian Ceynowa described the inhabitants of Kociewie; he named the people around Gniew and Pelplin as the &quot;Fetrów&quot; and &quot;Kociewiem&quot; respectively, distinguished by their melodic accents, who farmed pigs and horses. To their north were the &quot;Pola&quot; of the fields around Starogard Gdański.

In 1906–1907, Polish children in Kociewie joined the children school strikes against Germanisation that spread throughout the Prussian Partition of Poland. Following World War I, Poland regained independence and control of Kociewie.

=== World War II ===

Following the Nazi German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Kociewie was declared part of the &quot;Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia&quot; on 8 October 1939, with its judicial institutions being incorporated into the German system of regional, national, and Higher National courts the following year. Under German occupation, the Polish population was subjected to various crimes, such as mass arrests, imprisonment, slave labor, expulsions, kidnapping of children, deportations to concentration camps and genocide, including the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. Major sites of massacres of Poles in the region included Szpęgawsk, Mniszek, Skarszewy and Grupa. The occupiers also murdered the patients of the psychiatric hospitals in Kocborowo (district of Starogard) and Świecie.
== Geography ==
=== Cities and towns ===
== Genetics ==
In a 2013 study, Y-DNA haplogroups among the Polish population indigenous to Kociewie (n=158) were reported as follows:

56.3% R1a, 17.7% R1b, 8.2% I1, 7.6% I2, 3.8% E1b1b, 1.9% N1, 1.9% J and 2% of other haplogroups.

==Culture==

The region is rich in historic architecture of various styles, including Gothic, Baroque and Art Nouveau. Most notable Gothic landmarks are the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in Pelplin and Gniew Castle. John III Sobieski often resided in Gniew as a local starost before he became King of Poland.

Main museums of the region include:
*Vistula River Museum in Tczew, located in a pre-war agricultural machine factory where during World War II, a transit camp for Poles expelled from the region was established and operated by Nazi Germany.
*The Shipwreck Conservation Centre, a branch of the National Maritime Museum in Gdańsk, is located in Tczew.
*Diocesan Museum in Pelplin, which contains one of the finest collections of medieval art in Poland, and the country&#x27;s sole copy of the Gutenberg Bible.
*Museum of Kociewie Land in Starogard Gdański with archaeological, ethnographic and historical collections, located in two medieval defensive towers.

<text>The Allied Armies in Italy (AAI) was the title of the highest Allied field headquarters in Italy, during the middle part of the Italian campaign of World War II. In the early and later stages of the campaign the headquarters was known as the 15th Army Group; it reported to the Joint Allied command Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ), the theatre command for the Mediterranean theatre.

The 15th Army Group was renamed the Allied forces in Italy on 11 January 1944, then Allied Central Mediterranean Force on 18 January 1944 and finally the Allied Armies in Italy on 9 March 1944. The 15th Army Group was commanded by General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander until 11 December 1944. Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, formerly the commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, then took command and the headquarters title was changed back to the 15th Army Group.

The AAI thus controlled the Allied land forces for some of the hardest fighting of the entire war. Operations carried out included: the long stalemate on the Gustav Line with the hard-fought battles of Monte Cassino; the Anzio landings; the liberation of Rome; the assault on the Gothic Line, Operation OLIVE; and ending with Operation GRAPESHOT, in which the 15th Army Group struck again just south of the Po valley.

For all of its life the command consisted of the American Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Clark and, from December 1944, Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott, and the British Eighth Army, under Lieutenant General Sir Oliver W. H. Leese and, from October 1944, Lieutenant General Sir Richard L. McCreery.

<text>In Christianity, angels are the messengers of God. 

 affirms that &quot;all [of them are] ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation&quot;.

==In the Bible==
 attributes the guardianship of men to the angels.
In Jesus warns not to despise children because &quot;their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.&quot; affirms that, like the angels, &quot;those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die.&quot;

== General views ==

=== Antiquity ===

In chapter V of Ignatius of Antioch&#x27;s &quot;Letter to the Trallians&quot;, the bishop gives a listing of angels not unlike that later proposed by Pseudo-Dionysius. In his First Epistle of Clement, Clement of Rome exhorts his listeners to join the angels in praising God. Clement of Alexandria wrote that angels “breathe” in men&#x27;s thoughts and reasonings, and “puts in” their hearts “strength” and a keener perception.
Evagrius Ponticus spoke of the concept of angelic companions and angels as models for behavior.

Augustine of Hippo remarks, the angels were experiencing something new as the creation of God unfolded. Augustine also considers that the &#x27;good&#x27; angels seek at all times, to direct us towards the true source of happiness, God; that they encourage us in worship of God.

=== Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy ===
 
According to Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite&#x27;s &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot; (&quot;On the Celestial Hierarchy&quot;), there are three levels (&quot;sphere&quot;) of angels, inside each of which there are three orders. 

Various works of Christian theology have devised hierarchies of angelic beings. The most influential Christian angelic hierarchy was put forward around the turn of the 6th century CE by Pseudo-Dionysius in his work &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot;. He claimed to be an important figure who was converted by Paul the Apostle, and the Pseudo-Dionysius enjoyed greater influence than he would have if he had used his actual name, until Erasmus publicised doubts about the age of the work in the early 16th century.

=== Catholic Church ===
According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; (CCC) paragraph 328, &quot;the existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that Sacred Scripture usually calls &#x27;angels&#x27; is a truth of faith. The witness of Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition.&quot; The same catechism states: &quot;The whole life of the church benefits from the mysterious and powerful help of the angels [...] From its beginning until death, human life is surrounded by their watchful care and intercession.&quot; It also states, &quot;Christ is the center of the angelic world. They are &quot;His&quot; angels [...] They belong to Him because they were created through and for Him&quot;.

=== The New Church (Swedenborgianism) ===
The New Church denominations that arose from the writings of theologian Emanuel Swedenborg have distinct ideas about angels and the spiritual world in which they dwell. Adherents believe that all angels are in human form with a spiritual body, and are not just minds without form. There are different orders of angels according to the three heavens, and each angel dwells in one of innumerable societies of angels. Such a society of angels can appear as one angel as a whole.

All angels originate from the human race, and there is not one angel in heaven who first did not live in a material body. Moreover, all children who die not only enter heaven but eventually become angels. The life of angels is that of usefulness, and their functions are so many that they cannot be enumerated. However each angel will enter a service according to the use that they had performed in their earthly life. Names of angels, such as Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, signify a particular angelic function rather than an individual being.

While living in one&#x27;s body an individual has conjunction with heaven through the angels, and with each person, there are at least two evil spirits and two angels. Temptation or pains of conscience originates from a conflict between evil spirits and angels. Due to man&#x27;s sinful nature it is dangerous to have open direct communication with angels and they can only be seen when one&#x27;s spiritual sight has been opened. Thus from moment to moment angels attempt to lead each person to what is good tacitly using the person&#x27;s own thoughts.

=== Latter Day Saint movement ===

The Latter Day Saint movement views angels as the messengers of God. They are sent to mankind to deliver messages, minister to humanity, teach doctrines of salvation, call mankind to repentance, give priesthood keys, save individuals in perilous times, and guide humankind.

Latter Day Saints believe that angels either are the spirits of humans who are deceased or who have yet to be born, or are humans who have been resurrected or translated and have physical bodies of flesh and bones. Joseph Smith taught that &quot;there are no angels who minister to this earth but those that do belong or have belonged to it.&quot; As such, Latter Day Saints also believe that Adam, the first man, was and is now the archangel Michael, and that Gabriel lived on the earth as Noah. Likewise the Angel Moroni first lived in a pre-Columbian American civilization as the 5th-century prophet-warrior named Moroni.

Smith described his first angelic encounter in the following manner:
Most angelic visitations in the early Latter Day Saint movement were witnessed by Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who both said (prior to the establishment of the church in 1830) they had been visited by the prophet Moroni, John the Baptist, and the apostles Peter, James, and John. Later, after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Smith and Cowdery said they had been visited by Jesus, and subsequently by Moses, Elias, and Elijah.

Others who said they received a visit by an angel include the other two of the Three Witnesses: David Whitmer and Martin Harris. Many other Latter Day Saints, both in the early and modern church, have said they had seen angels, although Smith posited that, except in extenuating circumstances such as the restoration, mortals teach mortals, spirits teach spirits, and resurrected beings teach other resurrected beings.

==Catholic angel hierarchy==
===First Order===
==== Seraphim ====

Tradition places seraphim in a rank in Christian angelology, based on Isaiah&#x27;s use of the word. Seraphim angels are the closest to God and lead worship in heaven by singing endless praises to him.

==== Cherubim ====
In the Book of Ezekiel, and in some Christian icons, the cherub is depicted as having two pairs of wings, and four faces: that of a lion (representative of all wild animals), an ox (domestic animals), a human (humanity), and an eagle (birds). Their legs were straight, the soles of their feet like the hooves of a bull, gleaming like polished brass. Later tradition ascribes to them a variety of physical appearances. In Western Christian tradition, cherubim have become associated with the putto (derived from classical Cupid/Eros), resulting in depictions of cherubim as small, plump, winged boys.

==== Thrones or Ophanim ====
The &quot;ophanim&quot; refer to the wheels seen in Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of the chariot (Hebrew ) in . One of the Dead Sea scrolls (4Q405) construes them as angels.

===Second Order===
==== Dominions or Lordships ====
The Dominions (lat. &quot;dominatio&quot;, plural &quot;dominationes&quot;, also translated from the Greek term &quot;kyriotētes&quot;, pl. of &quot;kyriotēs&quot;, as &quot;Lordships&quot;) are traditionally held to govern the movement of stars, planets, and other celestial objects.

==== Virtues ====
According to &quot;The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville&quot;, the Virtues are known for their control of the elements. In addition to being the spirits of motion, they also assist in governing elements of nature, such as storms. They also assist with miracles, as well as encourage humans to strengthen their faith in God.

==== Powers or Authorities ====
In &quot;The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville&quot;, the Powers (lat. &quot;potestas&quot; (f), pl. &quot;potestates&quot;) (Greek: ἐξουσίαι) are given their name because they are angels who have power over evil forces, which the angels are able to restrain to keep them from doing harm. Powers also oversee the power which human beings—such as kings—have been given in the world.

===Third Order===
==== Principalities or Rulers ====
According to &quot;The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville&quot;, the Principalities (), also translated as &quot;Princedoms&quot; and &quot;Rulers&quot;, from the Greek &quot;archai&quot;, pl. of &quot;archē&quot; (see Greek root in Eph 3:10), are the angels that guide and protect nations, or groups of peoples, and institutions such as the Church. The Principalities preside over the bands of angels and charge them with fulfilling the divine ministry. There are some who administer and some who assist.

An example of a Principality angel with a specific &quot;cultus&quot; is the Angel of Portugal.

==== Archangels ====

The word &quot;archangel&quot; is only used twice in the New Testament: in and .

In most Christian traditions, Gabriel is also considered an archangel, but there is no direct literary support for this assumption. The term &quot;archangel&quot; appears only in the singular, never plural, and only in specific reference to Michael.

The name of the archangel Raphael appears only in the Book of Tobit (Tobias).

The Holy See&#x27;s 2001 &quot;Directory on popular piety&quot; states: &quot;The practice of assigning names to the Holy Angels should be discouraged, except in the cases of Gabriel, Raphael and Michael whose names are contained in Holy Scripture&quot;.

==== Guardian angels ====

A guardian angel is a type of angel that is assigned to protect and guide a particular person, group or nation. Belief in tutelary beings can be traced throughout all antiquity. The idea of angels that guard over people played a major role in Ancient Judaism. In Christianity, the hierarchy of angels was extensively developed in the 5th century by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. The theology of angels and tutelary spirits has undergone many changes since the 5th century. The belief is that guardian angels serve to protect whichever person God assigns them to. The Watchers were of this class of angels.

<text>Country Grammar is the debut studio album by American rapper and singer Nelly. It was released on June 27, 2000, by Universal Records. The production on the album was handled by Jason &quot;Jay E&quot; Epperson, with additional production by C-Love, Kevin Law, City Spud, Steve &quot;Blast&quot; Wills and Basement Beats. Nelly contributed to all lyrics on the album, with Epperson and City Spud also contributing. With the album&#x27;s release, Nelly and his &quot;St. Lunatics&quot; crew cemented the St. Louis sound firmly amongst other southern hip hop artists in the year 2000, such as Juvenile, Trina, Ludacris, OutKast, Three 6 Mafia and UGK. &quot;Country Grammar&quot; also introduced the world to Nelly&#x27;s unique musical style of pop-rap and radio &quot;singalongs&quot; with a Missouri twang. It was supported by four successful singles: &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot;, &quot;E.I.&quot;, &quot;Ride wit Me&quot; and &quot;Batter Up&quot;. Its lead single, &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot;, peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. Its second single &quot;E.I.&quot; peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100, number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and number 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart. &quot;Ride wit Me&quot; peaked within the top five on the Hot 100, ARIA Singles Chart, Irish Singles Chart and UK Singles Chart. The album&#x27;s fourth and final single, &quot;Batter Up&quot; featuring St. Lunatics members Murphy Lee and Ali, achieved moderate chart success.

&quot;Country Grammar&quot; received positive reviews, with critics praising Nelly&#x27;s vocal style and the album&#x27;s production. It topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for five consecutive weeks, and the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for six consecutive weeks. It peaked in the top five on the New Zealand Albums Chart and Australian Albums Chart, as well as the top ten on the Canadian Albums Chart and Dutch Albums Chart. The album was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) and Music Canada (MC). The former denoted shipments of 45,000 copies while the latter denoted 300,000 copies.

In 2016, &quot;Country Grammar&quot; became the ninth hip hop album to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of 10 million copies in the US. Its commercial success secured Nelly&#x27;s status as one of the most successful hip hop acts of the 2000s decade. On &quot;Billboard&quot; decade-end chart, Nelly ranked as the third most successful act of the 2000s decade, due largely to the success of &quot;Country Grammar&quot; and his follow-up album &quot;Nellyville&quot; (2002).

==Background and production==
In his early years, Nelly frequently moved locations around the United States, before residing in the city of St. Louis, Missouri. It was there where he discovered rap artists synonymous inside the city. In his teenage years, Nelly moved to University City, a suburb of St. Louis, where he shifted his aspirations from becoming a baseball player to producing stories and rhymes. Along with some friends from high school: Ali Jones, Torhi &quot;Murphy Lee&quot; Harper, Kyjuan and Lavell &quot;City Spud&quot; Webb, Nelly formed the group St. Lunatics in 1993. Frustrated by the lack of attention from record companies, the group formed the consensus to allow Nelly to pursue a solo career, while Ali and Murphy Lee released their own solo albums. Nelly produced demos, which were sent to national labels, eventually gaining attention from Universal Records who signed a record deal with Nelly and the St. Lunatics in 1999, with Universal releasing the former&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Country Grammar&quot;, in 2000. All songs on &quot;Country Grammar&quot; were recorded by Steve Eigner, and mixed by Rich Travali. Kenny Dykstra provided recording assistance and Jason Standard assisted in mixing. Mastering was performed by Herb Powers, with A&amp;R directed by Kevin Law and Coordinated by Craig Yoskowitz. Management was provided by Tony Davis and Courtney Benson, with legality handled by Todd Rubenstein. Creative direction was handled by Sandra Brummels, with design done by BENTO Design and photography done by Jonathen Mannion.

==Composition==
Much of Nelly&#x27;s rap style draws from his origins, as it contains Southern drawl with Midwestern, Missouri twang, that incorporates both country and urban styles. In conjunction, Nelly approaches a pop-rap singalong vocal style, which AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier notes present within &quot;Country Grammar&quot; tracks including &quot;Ride wit Me&quot; and &quot;E.I.&quot;. Peter Shapiro described Nelly&#x27;s singing and rapping as using &quot;unforgettable hooks based on schoolyard songs, double-dutch chants, and nonsense rhymes&quot;. Much of &quot;Country Grammar&quot; tracks are bass-heavy, that are primarily Southern hip-hop based and minimalistic. In the album&#x27;s self-titled track, Nelly&#x27;s vocals are slurred and slow, and are a &quot;smooth, slippery-fast instrument&quot; with &quot;reggae inflections&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Kris Ex found the song&#x27;s lyrics to depict Nelly &quot;riding around town in an expensive SUV with an assault weapon&quot;. &quot;Ride wit Me&quot; is a rap and pop crossover that samples DeBarge&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;I Like It&quot;, and its lyrics feature Nelly introspecting. Ex found the chorus of &quot;E.I.&quot; to contain the vocal style of rapper The Notorious B.I.G. &quot;Luven Me&quot; samples &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop (Ever Loving Me)&quot; by One Way and &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; by Tony! Toni! Toné!. Steve Sutherland of &quot;NME&quot; interpreted &quot;Luven Me&quot; as a &quot;virtual rewrite&quot; of rapper Tupac Shakur&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Dear Mama&quot;.

==Singles==
&quot;Country Grammar&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single on February 29, 2000, in the US. The song was written by Nelly and Jason &quot;Jay E&quot; Epperson, and produced by the latter. Its lyrics are based on the children clapping game Down Down Baby. &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot; peaked at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number ten on the Canadian Hot 100 and twenty on ARIA Singles Chart. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The second single, &quot;E.I.&quot;, was written by Nelly and Epperson and produced by the latter. It reached number sixteen on the Hot 100, number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and number twelve on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was certified gold by the ARIA.

Written by Nelly and Epperson and produced by the latter, &quot;Ride wit Me&quot; was released as &quot;Country Grammar&quot; third single. The track features City Spud, and reached number three on the Hot 100, the highest-charting song from &quot;Country Grammar&quot; in the US. It also peaked at number three on the UK Singles chart, number four on the ARIA Singles Chart, Irish Singles Chart, number five on the Dutch Singles Chart and number seven on the Norwegian Singles Chart. It was certified gold by the RIAA and platinum by the ARIA. &quot;Batter Up&quot; was released as the fourth and final single from the album. It features Murphy Lee and Ali, and was written by Nelly, Epperson and Steve &quot;Blast&quot; Wills, while being produced by Wills. &quot;Batter Up&quot; peaked at number eight on the Belgian Singles Chart (Flanders) and number nineteen on the ARIA Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Country Grammar&quot; received acclaim by music critics. Steve Sutherland lauded the album in his review for &quot;NME&quot;, praising Nelly&#x27;s utilization of vocal characteristics from other rap artists, including Tupac Shakur and Cypress Hill. Sutherland described the album as a &quot;rarity&quot;, noting stand-out tracks such as the &quot;seductive rap/pop crossover&quot; &quot;Ride wit Me&quot;, while likening &quot;Batter Up&quot; to &quot;DMX with a humour infusion&quot;. He closed his review declaring &quot;Country Grammar&quot; as &quot;album of the year&quot;. While writing that &quot;Country Grammar&quot; demonstrates that &quot;tiresome rap topics&quot; are not restricted to &quot;the coasts&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; David Browne highlighted Nelly&#x27;s &quot;smooth, slippery-fast&quot; voice, as well as the album&#x27;s &quot;appealingly minimalist tracks&quot; and &quot;introspective moments&quot; such as &quot;Ride wit Me&quot;.

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that Nelly presents an &quot;easy mix of N.O. Bounce, Cleveland thug harmony, and L.A. tweedle-twaddle&quot;, finding that Nelly&#x27;s heavy accent makes his hedonism more accessible. &quot;People&quot; noted that Nelly implements his own &quot;laid-back charm&quot; to &quot;Country Grammar&quot; southern hip hop, and that while he shows &quot;limited thematic vocabulary&quot;, he articulates escapism to compensate for this. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier praised the album&#x27;s &quot;tongue-twisting&quot; self-titled track as &quot;infectious&quot;, noting other tracks to contain the same elements, including &quot;Ride wit Me&quot; and &quot;E.I.&quot;. Birchmeier wrote that the album transcends regional styles such as southern hip hop to appeal to rap-pop audiences, while praising producer Jason &quot;Jay E&quot; Epperson&#x27;s contribution to the album.

Reviewing &quot;Country Grammar&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kris Ex wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;liquid bass bumps&quot; interlope well with Nelly&#x27;s &quot;wordplay-heavy sing-song rhyme-flow&quot;, while declaring &quot;Country Grammar&quot; to be &quot;the best thing to come out of St. Louis&quot; since comedian Redd Foxx. At the 2001 Soul Train Music Awards, &quot;Country Grammar&quot; earned Nelly the award for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist. Nelly was nominated for four awards at the Online Hip-Hop Awards, for Favorite Music Video, Song of the Year (both for &quot;E.I.&quot;), Album of the Year (for &quot;Country Grammar&quot;) and Outstanding Graphic Design for his official website. He won the awards for Song of the Year and Artist of the Year.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Country Grammar&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on the week of July 15, 2000, at number 3, selling 235,000 copies. The album remained within the top 10 for several weeks before topping it on the week of August 17, 2000, selling 235,000 copies and passing 1.5 million in sales that week. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put the album&#x27;s sales down to its support by its lead single, &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot;, as well as the lack of releases from other music artists during that period. The album sold 235,000 copies again the following week, continuing to stay atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Country Grammar&quot; topped US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for six consecutive weeks.

It reached its peak at number 3, for twenty-eight weeks after its debut on the chart, where it remained there for two non-consecutive weeks. It stayed on the chart for forty-two weeks before dropping out. The album was certified Triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for shipments of 45,000 units.

It peaked on the Swiss Albums Chart and French Albums Chart at numbers 90 and 109 respectively. &quot;Country Grammar&quot; topped the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums year-end chart in 2000.

==Legacy==
According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2022, &quot;Country Grammar&quot; is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Country Grammar&quot; success cemented Nelly&#x27;s position as one of the most successful hip hop acts of the emerging decade. &quot;Vibe&quot; emphasized Nelly&#x27;s expeditious fame, writing that the rapper debuted without the benefit of &quot;guest spots or Pen and Pixel produced teasers on his CD cover&quot;. The magazine continued to note the rapper&#x27;s absence of being associated with a notable group, &quot;he just came out and sold two million records in less than a month&quot;. Nelly&#x27;s success helped in making St. Louis more notable for emerging hip hop acts, increasing the city&#x27;s general reputation. &quot;Country Grammar&quot; experienced commercial success, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for five weeks in 2000, eventually going on to sell over 9 million copies in the US, making it the ninth best-selling rap album of all time in the country. It is one of the highest certified albums in the US history, being certified ten times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nelly ranked third on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 2000–2009 decade-end chart, due to the success of &quot;Country Grammar&quot; as well as his follow-up album &quot;Nellyville&quot; (2002). The latter album went on to sell 6,488,000 copies in the US.

&quot;Country Grammar&quot; was ranked as the 85th best album of all time on the &quot;Billboard Top 200 Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>Herbal medicine (also called herbalism, phytomedicine or phytotherapy) is the study of pharmacognosy and the use of medicinal plants, which are a basis of traditional medicine. With worldwide research into pharmacology, some herbal medicines have been translated into modern remedies, such as the anti-malarial group of drugs called artemisinin isolated from &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;, a herb that was known in Chinese medicine to treat fever. There is limited scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of many plants used in 21st-century herbalism, which generally does not provide standards for purity or dosage. The scope of herbal medicine sometimes includes fungal and bee products, as well as minerals, shells and certain animal parts.

Paraherbalism describes alternative and pseudoscientific practices of using unrefined plant or animal extracts as unproven medicines or health-promoting agents. Paraherbalism relies on the belief that preserving various substances from a given source with less processing is safer or more effective than manufactured products, a concept for which there is no evidence.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that the use of medicinal plants dates back to the Paleolithic age, approximately 60,000 years ago. Written evidence of herbal remedies dates back over 5,000 years to the Sumerians, who compiled lists of plants. Some ancient cultures wrote about plants and their medical uses in books called &quot;herbals&quot;. In ancient Egypt, herbs were mentioned in Egyptian medical papyri, depicted in tomb illustrations, or on rare occasions found in medical jars containing trace amounts of herbs. In ancient Egypt, the Ebers papyrus dates from about 1550 BCE, and covers more than 700 compounds, mainly of plant origin. The earliest known Greek herbals came from Theophrastus of Eresos who, in the 4th century BCE, wrote in Greek &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;, from Diocles of Carystus who wrote during the 3rd century BCE, and from Krateuas who wrote in the 1st century BCE. Only a few fragments of these works have survived intact, but from what remains, scholars have noted overlap with the Egyptian herbals. 

Seeds likely used for herbalism were found in archaeological sites of Bronze Age China dating from the Shang dynasty (). Over a hundred of the 224 compounds mentioned in the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;, an early Chinese medical text, are herbs. Herbs were also commonly used in the traditional medicine of ancient India, where the principal treatment for diseases was diet. &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;, originally written in Greek by Pedanius Dioscorides () of Anazarbus, Cilicia, a physician and botanist, is one example of herbal writing used over centuries until the 1600s.

==Modern herbal medicine==
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80 percent of the population of some Asian and African countries presently uses herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care.

Some prescription drugs have a basis as herbal remedies, including artemisinin, digitalis, quinine and taxanes.

===Regulatory review===

In 2015, the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; herbalism was one of 17 topics evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Establishing guidelines to assess the safety and efficacy of herbal products, the European Medicines Agency provided criteria in 2017 for evaluating and grading the quality of clinical research in preparing monographs about herbal products. In the United States, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the National Institutes of Health funds clinical trials on herbal compounds, provides fact sheets evaluating the safety, potential effectiveness and side effects of many plant sources, and maintains a registry of clinical research conducted on herbal products.

According to Cancer Research UK as of 2015, &quot;there is currently no strong evidence from studies in people that herbal remedies can treat, prevent or cure cancer&quot;.

===Prevalence of use===
The use of herbal remedies is more prevalent in people with chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, asthma, and end-stage kidney disease. Multiple factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, education and social class are also shown to have associations with the prevalence of herbal remedy use.

===Herbal preparations===

There are many forms in which herbs can be administered, the most common of which is a liquid consumed as a herbal tea or a (possibly diluted) plant extract.

Herbal teas, or tisanes, are the resultant liquid of extracting herbs into water, though they are made in a few different ways. Infusions are hot water extracts of herbs, such as chamomile or mint, through steeping. Decoctions are the long-term boiled extracts, usually of harder substances like roots or bark. Maceration is the cold infusion of plants with high mucilage-content, such as sage or thyme. To make macerates, plants are chopped and added to cold water. They are then left to stand for 7 to 12 hours (depending on the herb used). For most macerates, 10 hours is used.

Tinctures are alcoholic extracts of herbs, which are generally stronger than herbal teas. Tinctures are usually obtained by combining pure ethanol (or a mixture of pure ethanol with water) with the herb. A completed tincture has an ethanol percentage of at least 25% (sometimes up to 90%). Non-alcoholic tinctures can be made with glycerin but it is believed to be less absorbed by the body than alcohol based tinctures and has a shorter shelf life. Herbal wine and elixirs are alcoholic extracts of herbs, usually with an ethanol percentage of 12–38%. Extracts include liquid extracts, dry extracts, and nebulisates. Liquid extracts are liquids with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures. They are usually made by vacuum distilling tinctures. Dry extracts are extracts of plant material that are evaporated into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet.

The exact composition of a herbal product is influenced by the method of extraction. A tea will be rich in polar components because water is a polar solvent. Oil on the other hand is a non-polar solvent and it will absorb non-polar compounds. Alcohol lies somewhere in between.
Many herbs are applied topically to the skin in a variety of forms. Essential oil extracts can be applied to the skin, usually diluted in a carrier oil. Many essential oils can burn the skin or are simply too high dose used straight; diluting them in olive oil or another food grade oil such as almond oil can allow these to be used safely as a topical. Salves, oils, balms, creams, and lotions are other forms of topical delivery mechanisms. Most topical applications are oil extractions of herbs. Taking a food grade oil and soaking herbs in it for anywhere from weeks to months allows certain phytochemicals to be extracted into the oil. This oil can then be made into salves, creams, lotions, or simply used as an oil for topical application. Many massage oils, antibacterial salves, and wound healing compounds are made this way.

Inhalation, as in aromatherapy, can be used as a treatment.
===Safety===


It is a popular misconception that herbal medicines are safe and side-effect free. Consumption of herbs may cause adverse effects. Furthermore, &quot;adulteration, inappropriate formulation, or lack of understanding of plant and drug interactions have led to adverse reactions that are sometimes life threatening or lethal.&quot; Proper double-blind clinical trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of each plant before medical use.

Although many consumers believe that herbal medicines are safe because they are natural, herbal medicines and synthetic drugs may interact, causing toxicity to the consumer. Herbal remedies can also be dangerously contaminated, and herbal medicines without established efficacy, may unknowingly be used to replace prescription medicines.

Standardization of purity and dosage is not mandated in the United States, but even products made to the same specification may differ as a result of biochemical variations within a species of plant. Plants have chemical defense mechanisms against predators that can have adverse or lethal effects on humans. Examples of highly toxic herbs include poison hemlock and nightshade. They are not marketed to the public as herbs, because the risks are well known, partly due to a long and colorful history in Europe, associated with &quot;sorcery&quot;, &quot;magic&quot; and intrigue. 

Although not frequent, adverse reactions have been reported for herbs in widespread use. On occasion serious untoward outcomes have been linked to herb consumption. A case of major potassium depletion has been attributed to chronic licorice ingestion, and consequently professional herbalists avoid the use of licorice where they recognize that this may be a risk. Black cohosh has been implicated in a case of liver failure.
Few studies are available on the safety of herbs for pregnant women, and one study found that use of complementary and alternative medicines is associated with a 30% lower ongoing pregnancy and live birth rate during fertility treatment.

Examples of herbal treatments with likely cause-effect relationships with adverse events include aconite (which is often a legally restricted herb), Ayurvedic remedies, broom, chaparral, Chinese herb mixtures, comfrey, herbs containing certain flavonoids, germander, guar gum, liquorice root, and pennyroyal. Examples of herbs that may have long-term adverse effects include ginseng, the endangered herb goldenseal, milk thistle, senna, aloe vera juice, buckthorn bark and berry, cascara sagrada bark, saw palmetto, valerian, kava (which is banned in the European Union), St. John&#x27;s wort, khat, betel nut, the restricted herb ephedra, and guarana.

There is also concern with respect to the numerous well-established interactions of herbs and drugs. In consultation with a physician, usage of herbal remedies should be clarified, as some herbal remedies have the potential to cause adverse drug interactions when used in combination with various prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, just as a customer should inform a herbalist of their consumption of actual prescription and other medication.

For example, dangerously low blood pressure may result from the combination of a herbal remedy that lowers blood pressure together with prescription medicine that has the same effect. Some herbs may amplify the effects of anticoagulants.
Certain herbs as well as common fruit interfere with cytochrome P450, an enzyme critical to much drug metabolism.

In a 2018 study, the FDA identified active pharmaceutical additives in over 700 analyzed dietary supplements sold as &quot;herbal&quot;, &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot;. The undisclosed additives included &quot;unapproved antidepressants and designer steroids&quot;, as well as prescription drugs, such as sildenafil or sibutramine.

===Labeling accuracy===
Researchers at the University of Adelaide found in 2014 that almost 20 percent of herbal remedies surveyed were not registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, despite this being a condition for their sale. They also found that nearly 60 percent of products surveyed had ingredients that did not match what was on the label. Out of 121 products, only 15 had ingredients that matched their TGA listing and packaging.

In 2015, the New York Attorney General issued cease and desist letters to four major U.S. retailers (GNC, Target, Walgreens, and Walmart) who were accused of selling herbal supplements that were mislabeled and potentially dangerous. Twenty-four products were tested by DNA barcoding as part of the investigation, with all but five containing DNA that did not match the product labels.

===Practitioners of herbalism===
In some countries, formalized training and minimum education standards exist for herbalists, although these are not necessarily uniform within or between countries. In Australia, for example, the self-regulated status of the profession (as of 2009) resulted in variable standards of training, and numerous loosely formed associations setting different educational standards. One 2009 review concluded that regulation of herbalists in Australia was needed to reduce the risk of interaction of herbal medicines with prescription drugs, to implement clinical guidelines and prescription of herbal products, and to assure self-regulation for protection of public health and safety. In the United Kingdom, the training of herbalists is done by state-funded universities offering Bachelor of Science degrees in herbal medicine. In the United States, according to the American Herbalist Guild, &quot;there is currently no licensing or certification for herbalists in any state that precludes the rights of anyone to use, dispense, or recommend herbs.&quot; However, there are U.S. federal restrictions for marketing herbs as cures for medical conditions, or essentially practicing as an unlicensed physician.

===United States herbalism fraud===
Over the years 2017–2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warning letters to numerous herbalism companies for illegally marketing products under &quot;conditions that cause them to be drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)], because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body&quot; when no such evidence existed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA and U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued warnings to several hundred American companies for promoting false claims that herbal products could prevent or treat COVID-19 disease.

===Government regulations===
The World Health Organization (WHO), the specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health, published &quot;Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials&quot; in 1998 to support WHO Member States in establishing quality standards and specifications for herbal materials, within the overall context of quality assurance and control of herbal medicines.

In the European Union (EU), herbal medicines are regulated under the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products.

In the United States, herbal remedies are regulated dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) policy for dietary supplements. Manufacturers of products falling into this category are not required to prove the safety or efficacy of their product so long as they do not make &#x27;medical&#x27; claims or imply uses other than as a &#x27;dietary supplement&#x27;, though the FDA may withdraw a product from sale should it prove harmful.

Canadian regulations are described by the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate which requires an eight-digit Natural Product Number or Homeopathic Medicine Number on the label of licensed herbal medicines or dietary supplements.

Some herbs, such as cannabis and coca, are outright banned in most countries though coca is legal in most of the South American countries where it is grown. The &quot;Cannabis&quot; plant is used as a herbal medicine, and as such is legal in some parts of the world. Since 2004, the sales of ephedra as a dietary supplement is prohibited in the United States by the FDA, and subject to Schedule III restrictions in the United Kingdom.

===Scientific criticism===
Herbalism has been criticized as a potential &quot;minefield&quot; of unreliable product quality, safety hazards, and the potential for misleading health advice. Globally, there are no standards across various herbal products to authenticate their contents, safety or efficacy, and there is generally an absence of high-quality scientific research on product composition or effectiveness for anti-disease activity. Presumed claims of therapeutic benefit from herbal products, without rigorous evidence of efficacy and safety, receive skeptical views by scientists.

Unethical practices by some herbalists and manufacturers, which may include false advertising about health benefits on product labels or literature, and contamination or use of fillers during product preparation, may erode consumer confidence about services and products.

==Paraherbalism==
Paraherbalism is the pseudoscientific use of extracts of plant or animal origin as supposed medicines or health-promoting agents. Phytotherapy differs from plant-derived medicines in standard pharmacology because it does not isolate and standardize the compounds from a given plant believed to be biologically active. It relies on the false belief that preserving the complexity of substances from a given plant with less processing is safer and potentially more effective, for which there is no evidence either condition applies.

Phytochemical researcher Varro Eugene Tyler described paraherbalism as &quot;faulty or inferior herbalism based on pseudoscience&quot;, using scientific terminology but lacking scientific evidence for safety and efficacy. Tyler listed ten fallacies that distinguished herbalism from paraherbalism, including claims that there is a conspiracy to suppress safe and effective herbs, herbs cannot cause harm, whole herbs are more effective than molecules isolated from the plants, herbs are superior to drugs, the doctrine of signatures (the belief that the shape of the plant indicates its function) is valid, dilution of substances increases their potency (a doctrine of the pseudoscience of homeopathy), astrological alignments are significant, animal testing is not appropriate to indicate human effects, anecdotal evidence is an effective means of proving a substance works and herbs were created by God to cure disease. Tyler suggests that none of these beliefs have any basis in fact.

==Traditional systems==

===Africa===

Up to 80% of the population in Africa uses traditional medicine as primary health care.

===Americas===
Native Americans used about 2,500 of the approximately 20,000 plant species that are native to North America.

In Andean healing practices, the use of entheogens, in particular the San Pedro cactus (&quot;Echinopsis pachanoi&quot;) is still a vital component, and has been around for millennia.

===China===
Some researchers trained in both Western and traditional Chinese medicine have attempted to deconstruct ancient medical texts in the light of modern science. In 1972, Tu Youyou, a pharmaceutical chemist and Nobel Prize winner, extracted the anti-malarial drug artemisinin from sweet wormwood, a traditional Chinese treatment for intermittent fevers.

===India===

In India, Ayurvedic medicine has quite complex formulas with 30 or more ingredients, including a sizable number of ingredients that have undergone &quot;alchemical processing&quot;, chosen to balance dosha. In Ladakh, Lahul-Spiti, and Tibet, the Tibetan Medical System is prevalent, also called the &quot;Amichi Medical System&quot;. Over 337 species of medicinal plants have been documented by C.P. Kala. Those are used by Amchis, the practitioners of this medical system. The Indian book, Vedas, mentions treatment of diseases with plants.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, especially among the Javanese, the jamu traditional herbal medicine may have originated in the Mataram Kingdom era, some 1300 years ago. The bas-reliefs on Borobudur depict the image of people grinding herbs with stone mortar and pestle, a drink seller, a herbalist, and masseuse treating people. The Madhawapura inscription from Majapahit period mentioned a specific profession of herb mixer and combiner (herbalist), called &quot;Acaraki&quot;. The book from Mataram dated from circa 1700 contains 3,000 entries of jamu herbal recipes, while Javanese classical literature Serat Centhini (1814) describes some jamu herbal concoction recipes.

Though possibly influenced by Indian Ayurveda systems, the Indonesia archipelago holds numerous indigenous plants not found in India, including plants similar to those in Australia beyond the Wallace Line. Jamu practices may vary from region to region, and are often not recorded, especially in remote areas of the country. Although primarily herbal, some Jamu materials are acquired from animals, such as honey, royal jelly, milk, and &quot;Ayam Kampung&quot; eggs.

==Beliefs==

Herbalists tend to use extracts from parts of plants, such as the roots or leaves, believing that plants are subject to environmental pressures and therefore develop resistance to threats such as radiation, reactive oxygen species and microbial attack to survive, providing defensive phytochemicals of use in herbalism.

==Use of plants by animals==
Indigenous healers often claim to have learned by observing that sick animals change their food preferences to nibble at bitter herbs they would normally reject. Field biologists have provided corroborating evidence based on observation of diverse species, such as chickens, sheep, butterflies, and chimpanzees. The habit of changing diet has been shown to be a physical means of purging intestinal parasites. Sick animals tend to forage plants rich in secondary metabolites, such as tannins and alkaloids.

<text>Three Bridges is one of 14 neighbourhoods within the town of Crawley, in the county of West Sussex in England.

==History==
Three Bridges, at first a tiny hamlet, began to grow with the coming of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841. Despite beliefs to the contrary, the village was named, not after rail bridges, but after three much older crossings over streams in the area (River Mole tributaries).

The hamlet became the site of an important railway junction in 1848 with the opening of the branch line to Horsham and thence to Portsmouth. The railway established a motive power depot and marshalling yards to the south of the village. A further branch line to East Grinstead was opened in 1855. The village changed radically with the coming of the New town development in the Crawley area in the late 1940s. Three Bridges was one of the first group of neighbourhoods to be built, by 2020 there were 14 neighbourhoods.

== Railway transport==
Three Bridges railway station is an important junction station where the Arun Valley Line to Portsmouth branches off from the Brighton Main Line that runs between London and Brighton. A third line to East Grinstead closed on 1 January 1967.

A rolling stock depot, Three Bridges depot, was constructed in the early 2010s for the Thameslink rolling stock programme

Three Bridges ROC, the main operating centre for the south east, is also located close to Three Bridges station.

==Education==
Hazelwick School is a comprehensive school located in Three Bridges. It was opened as a Secondary Modern School in 1953, which became a Comprehensive school in the mid 1960s. It is also (since 1998) designated as a Technology and Humanities College. Hazelwick has over 110 teachers and more than 2100 pupils. Many former school pupils later became famous including Gareth Southgate and Chico Slimani. It also educated two of the controversial Fertilizer Bomb plotters, Omar Khyam and Jawad Akbar who were arrested, charged and imprisoned for life sentences due to Government Home Security surveillance during Operation Crevice.

Primary schools in Three Bridges include Three Bridges Primary School.

==Sport==

<text>The Greater Mumbai Police (Marathi: बृहन्मुंबई पोलीस, IAST: &quot;Brihanmumbaī Pulīs&quot;, formerly &quot;Bombay City Police&quot;) is the police department of the city of Mumbai, Maharashtra. It is a city police commissionerate under the Maharashtra Police and has the primary responsibilities of law enforcement in the city of Mumbai and its surrounding areas. The force&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot; (, English: &quot;To protect Good and to destroy Evil&quot;).

It is headed by a Commissioner of Police (CP), an officer of the Indian Police Service. The force is divided into 12 police districts, called zones, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), further subdivided into 94 police stations.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

From 1534 until 1661, Mumbai (then known as Bombay) was under Portuguese colonial rule. The Portuguese authorities in Mumbai established a police station in 1661, the same year it was transferred to the English colonial empire. Now being governed by the East India Company, the new city administration established a militia known as the Bhandari Militia (which consisted of approximately 600 Bandareen men supplied by 100 local landowners) in 1669 to combat street gangs that targeted sailors. This new force, which was organised by governor of Bombay Gerald Aungier, was headquartered at Mahim, Sevree and Sion (with a subedar stationed in each headquarter) and used primarily for law enforcement purposes. In 1672, the city administration implemented a policy of having all law enforcement decisions to be subject to judicial review by the judiciary, though the East India Company suffered from a lack of trained judges during the first decades of their control over Mumbai. The situation remained unchanged for decades. By 1682, law enforcement in Mumbai remained stagnant, and there was only one ensign, two corporals and three sergeants in the Bhandari Militia.

=== Creation and early days ===
On 29 March 1780, the office of the Lieutenant of Police was dissolved and the office of Deputy of Police was created. James Tod, the then Lieutenant of Police was appointed as the first Deputy of Police on 5 April 1780. He was tried and dismissed for corruption in 1790. Subsequently, the designation was changed to &quot;Deputy of Police and High Constable&quot;.

In 1793, Act XXXIII, Geo. III was promulgated. The post of Deputy of Police was abolished and a post of Superintendent of Police was created in its place, with a &quot;Deputy of Superintendent of Police&quot; assisting him. Mr. Simon Halliday was the first Superintendent of Police, and governed till 1808. During this time, a thorough revision and re-arrangement of policing in the area outside the Fort was carried out. The troublesome area known as &quot;Dungree and the Woods&quot; was split up into 14 Police divisions, each division being staffed by two English constables and a varying number of Peons (not exceeding 130 for the whole area), who were to be stationary in their respective charges and responsible for dealing with all illegal acts committed within their limits.

=== Post-1857 ===

Following the establishment of Crown rule in India after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in 1864 Commissioners of Police were assigned to the three presidency towns of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. On 14 December 1864, Sir Frank Souter was appointed as the first Police Commissioner of Bombay; in the same year, Khan Bahadur Sheikh Ibrahim Sheikh Imam became the first Indian to be appointed to a senior rank in the Bombay Police, while Souter remained in office for 24 years until 3 July 1888. In 1896, the Police Commissioner of Bombay&#x27;s office was moved to an Indo-Saracenic building, which it still occupies to this day. The building has been designated as a protected heritage site by the Indian government.

=== After 1947 ===
After independence, many changes to the Bombay Police were instituted. On 15 August 1947, J.S. Bharucha became the first Indian head of the Bombay Police, taking over from the last British Commissioner, Mr. A.E. Caffin. A dog squad was set up in 1965. Computers were first used by the Bombay police in 1976. A Narcotics Cell and an anti-terrorist special operations squad were created in 1989.

The service was renamed to Mumbai Police in 1995, following the renaming of Bombay to Mumbai. In 1995, the control room was computerised, and finally, in 1997, the Mumbai Police went online.

In 2002, the airport police section handed over security to the CISF.

A massive modernization of the Mumbai Police took place in 2005. New vehicles, guns and electronic equipment were procured for police use. The Tourist Squad was also created to patrol the beaches of Mumbai. On 30 May 2009 the Maharashtra government in Mumbai set up a police station dedicated to tackling cyber crime. It is the third such facility in India after Bangalore and Hyderabad. The dedicated police station will now register first information reports (FIRs) on its own and investigate offences pertaining to cyberspace. It is not clear how people abroad may report to Mumbai Cybercell. The police station will take care of all cyber cases in the city including that of terror e-mails.
The existing Cyber Crime Investigation Cell of the city police probes cyber offences, but the FIRs are registered in local police stations depending on the site of the offence.
A specially trained team of over 25 policemen, headed by an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), were selected for the new job.
The facility will function under the supervision of Deputy Commissioner of Police (Preventive) and Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime).

Following the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, a SWAT like unit was created to combat terrorism. Named as Force One, the unit has been trained in the use of sophisticated arms and explosives, and the personnel are known for their rapid shooting skills. While the National Security Guard has a regional hub in Mumbai, Force One is expected to be part of the initial response to a terror strike in Mumbai.

==Headquarters==
The Mumbai Police Headquarters are in a Grade II-A listed heritage building that was built in 1894 and designed by John Adams, who also designed the Royal Bombay Yacht Club. It is located opposite Crawford Market in South Mumbai, a mile away from the Victoria Terminus. The construction work started on 17 November 1894 and finished two years later on 24 December 1896. The building was formally opened on 1 January 1897.

The architectural style of the building is Gothic Revival. In contrast to the Maharashtra Police Headquarters in Fort, which uses blue basalt and was built some two decades earlier, this building uses yellow basalt. The building underwent a major restoration in 2017 for the first time in its 120-year history. In 2018, it was announced that a police museum funded by Tata Trusts would open in the building. Since then, there have been no further developments.

== Organisation ==
The Mumbai Police Department is headed by a Police Commissioner, who is an IPS officer. The Mumbai Police comes under the state home department through Maharashtra Police. The city is divided into Twelve police zones and Twenty Five traffic police zones, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police. The Traffic Police is a semi-autonomous body under the Mumbai Police.

The department holds several programs for the welfare of its officials including Retirement Planning Workshop.

=== Geographical division ===
Mumbai police is broadly divided into five regions namely Central, North, South, East and West. For administrative purposes, each region is subdivided into 3 to 4 zones. Each zone contains 3 to 4 police stations. Each zone is commanded by a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP). Apart from the 12 zones, there is also an additional Port zone. Police stations under the Port zone keep vigil on the Mumbai Port and container terminals in Mumbai. There are a total of 91 police stations in the jurisdiction of Mumbai Police.

== High-profile cases ==

=== 2008 Mumbai attacks ===
Anti-Terrorism Squad Chief Hemant Karkare, Additional Commissioner of Police Ashok Kamte and Encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar were among the policemen who fell to the bullets of the terrorists. Then Joint Commissioner of Mumbai Crime Branch Mr. Rakesh Maria under the leadership of Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor tackled the abrupt attack by his superb skills. Mr. Ramesh Mahale, then an officer with crime branch investigated the case and brought the lone arrested militant Ajmal Kasab to justice. Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor was shunted out of his office. Mahale resigned recently over a murder case investigation which he was leading.
In the following year, as a response to these attacks, a specialised counter-terrorism unit, Force One was formed and commissioned on 24 November 2009, two days before the anniversary of the 26/11 terror attacks. A Committee was appointed to look into the failures of cops pertaining to the terror attack. The Ram Pradhan Committee, as it came to be known, furnished a report recommending a series of improvements &amp; reforms. The State Government of Maharashtra however never had this report tabled in the legislature fearing a fallout over strictures passed in the report. A Public Interest Litigation has been filed by social activist Ketan Tirodkar to demand equal justice for all the police who were killed in the terror attack; especially for the members of the Bomb Disposal Squad of Mumbai Police. During the hearing of the petition, the Government informed the High Court that the Federal Government of India has rejected the proposal to award the Bomb Disposal Squad of the city police for their contribution in defusing granades in the terror attack.

===Sheena Bora murder case===

Sheena Bora, an executive working for Metro One based in Mumbai, went missing on 24 April 2012. In August 2015, the Mumbai Police had received a tip-off from an unknown man claiming that Sheena Bora had been murdered. After they got in touch with their Counterparts in Pune, they arrested her mother, Indrani Mukerjea, her stepfather Sanjeev Khanna, and her mother&#x27;s chauffeur, Shyamvar Pinturam Rai, for allegedly abducting and killing her and subsequently burning her corpse. They also arrested Indrani&#x27;s husband, Peter Mukerjea in connection with the case. Rai has now been allowed to turn approver in the case after he was pardoned by the Bandra Magistrate Court in Mumbai. As of May 2017, Indrani, Peter, and Sanjeev have been lodged in Byculla Women&#x27;s Prison and Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, respectively.

===Shakti Mills Gang Rape===

In August 2013, several men, including juveniles, were arrested by the Mumbai Police for the gang-rape of a photo journalist and a call center telephone operator. While they were praised for the swift action in catching the culprits, the department faced scrutiny for making the telephone operator go through the two-finger test. The culprits were charged under sections 376(d) for gang rape, 377 for unnatural offence, 120(b) for criminal conspiracy, sections 342 and 343 for wrongful restraint, section 506(2) for criminal intimidation and 34 for common intention and 201 for destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code. While the juveniles were sentenced to 3 years in a reform home by the Juvenile Justice Board, 3 of the adult culprits were given a death sentence for repeat offence. The death penalty was eventually commuted to life imprisonment without parole or remission in November 2021.

Junior officers Hemant Desai, Ashok Khot, Sachin Waze, Daya Nayak, Uttam Bhosale etc. assisted them.

Singh, which aired on Sony Channel, has been based on the Criminal Investigation Department of Mumbai Police. The show was aired from 21 January 1998(pilot episode aired on 29 April 1997), until it concluded on 27 October 2018, and the show has consistently had top ratings. CID also had been featured in the Guinness World Records for having an episode of 111 minutes shot in October 2004 without a single cut. The second season of the show featuring the same cast(except Phadnis), returned to be telecasted starting from 21 December 2024.

== Honours ==
The Ashok Chakra, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour during peace time, was conferred posthumously upon two Mumbai Police officers – Hemant Karkare and Ashok Kamte who were killed in the line of duty during the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

During the monsoon periods, several officers of Mumbai Police have been involved in filling potholes that were not filled by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, in order to facilitate a smooth traffic flow and to prevent road accidents/wrecks. The officers who fill the potholes have received praise, who themselves have criticized the BMC for inaction.

=== Other Initiatives ===
The Mumbai Police features a star studded show called Umang, which is organized to raise funds for welfare of their personnel, mostly lower-ranked ones. Several celebrities appear on the show every year to support the cause.

Every year on the World Environment Day, the Mumbai Police organizes a mass cycling event on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link for awareness of clean environment and reducing pollution. However, due to safety reasons and for smoother traffic flow, bicycles are prohibited on the rest of the days of the year, and can be seized or impounded if riders disobey the norms or fail to pay the traffic penalties.

On 10 October 2024, at the funeral of Ratan Tata, Mumbai Police delivered a ceremonial guard of honour and his body was wrapped in the Indian flag.

== Controversies ==
The Mumbai Police has a history of corruption, police brutality, refusal to file reports, aligning with political entities, professional incompetence, as well as moral policing. The department has also been criticized for overworking and underworking of personnel, especially the constable and Sub-Inspector rank officials. However, in recent times, situations have been changing, but have not been effective enough and still fall well below international standards. 

On 13 January 1982, dreaded gangster Manya Surve was killed in a shootout with Inspector Raja Tambat and ACP Isaque Bagwan, who fired five bullets into his chest and shoulder. Surve&#x27;s death became known as Mumbai&#x27;s first recorded encounter killing. The rate of encounter killings increased in the late 1980s and further rose after the 1993 Mumbai bombings; a total of 622 alleged criminals were killed in police encounters from 1982 to 2004.

On 16 November 1991, the Anti-Terrorism Squad, led by Additional Commissioner of Police Aftab Ahmed Khan, laid siege on Lokhandwala Complex to capture gangster Maya Dolas, and 6 others. Khan and his squad were criticized for firing 450 bullets which killed the gangsters, who refused to surrender. However, the ATS officers were exonerated following an inquiry.

Right before the 1993 Bombay bombings, Gul Mohammad, a small-time criminal, confessed to his role in the 1992 riots, his training in Pakistan, and a conspiracy underway to bomb major locations around the city, including the Bombay Stock Exchange, Sahar International Airport and the Shiv Sena Bhavan. However, his conspiracy claim was dismissed by the police as a &quot;mere bluff&quot;.

The 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai have been ascribed to a large scale intelligence failure by Mumbai Police.The attack also exposed several other weaknesses, such as using antiquated weaponry from World War II, poor marksmanship training, lack of a commando style force like the SWAT in the United States, as well as bureaucratic inefficiency when coordinating with the National Security Guard. Despite not having sophisticated weapons and body armor, the Mumbai Police was able to capture the lone gunman Ajmal Kasab at a roadblock near Girgaum Chowpatty. Another gunman, Ismail Khan was killed the shootout.

In 2003-04 Telgi scam also known as fake-stamp scam broke out in which Mumbai&#x27;s police commissioner R.S. Sharma came to be arrested along with many other senior officers. 
Another former police commissioner of Mumbai police Sanjay Pande came to be arrested in stock-exchange scam involving tapping of telephone lines of investors. 
Encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma came to be arrested in Antilia bomb scare case involving murder of Mansukh Hiren. 

Another encounter specialist Daya Nayak absconded while anti-corruption bureau of Mumbai was seeking his custody. Nayak is now facing a criminal accusation of planting drugs upon some youngsters during his tenure with the Anti-terrorist Squad of Maharashtra Police.

A reply filed by Director General of Police Housing Corporation (former Police Commissioner of Mumbai) Arup Patnaik has exposed land-grabbing offence by IASs, IPSs &amp; Bombay High Court Judges wherein six prime plots
of land reserved for service quarters of constabulary were usurped by private housing societies of the land-grabbing bureaucrats and judges of Bombay High Court. Three plots of land are located at Worli Sea Face while three are Western-Mumbai suburb Andheri west. This disclosure exposing the biggest organised land-grab operation by bureaucrats &amp; judges was made by Director General of Police Housing Corporation Shri Arupji Patnaiksaheb in his reply to a Public Interest Litigation filed by former journalist Ketan Tirodkar. 

In October 2019, it was reported that the non-gazette police officials, mostly the constable rank personnel, who are the lowest ranked and least paid, did not have decent housing, and many of them who were allotted an official accommodation were not satisfied with it due to poor quality and insufficient maintenance. Following complaints and dissatisfaction by the constables and their families, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority began to redevelop police colonies to improve living conditions in 2023.

On 13 March 2021, Senior Inspector Sachin Vaze, an encounter specialist, was arrested for his involvement in the Antilia bomb scare. Through an investigation, Vaze revealed that he was acting at the behest of Anil Deshmukh, who was then minister of Home Affairs. Vaze was also involved in collecting extortion money in December 2020 from members of the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR). He would call from his office in the Commissioner of Police compound for monthly amounts and, if paid, would ensure that the Social Service Branch would not conduct raids. &quot;Mid-Day&quot; reported that a source said, &quot;SSB carried out raids at hotels and bars and filed cases against them. The last SSB raid was in early February. After that, no raid was conducted as everybody agreed to pay the money to be able to operate.&quot; Vaze was previously involved in the custodial torture and death of Khwaja Yunus in 2004, a suspect in the 2002 Ghatkopar bombing case.

The traffic branch of Mumbai Police has faced ire and disparagement for harassing bicyclists and slapping hefty fines on them for riding on Bandra–Worli Sea Link, as well as for obstructing traffic due to slow speeds of riders. The fines for bicyclists riding on the bridge, as well as on the Trans Harbour Link, Eastern Freeway, the BKC-Chunabhatti flyover, and the Coastal Road is Rs 1200(US$15), which has been steeply set and does not conform to the standards of Motor Vehicles Act due to non requirement of licenses; furthermore, refusal to pay and non-compliance has led to seizure of bicycles, detaining of riders, deflating the tires, or towing away bicycles parked at no parking areas, which constitutes a misconduct by police personnel and violation of rights of those owning non-motorized/self-propelled vehicles. The penalties charged against bicyclists for riding on the prohibited areas as well as various other offenses under sections of the Motor Vehicles Act is unconstitutional and not authorized, as the Act is neither applicable to bicyclists, nor does it mandate any penalties against bicyclists. While penalties against motor vehicles such as two-wheelers, cars and heavy vehicles are mentioned for various offenses on Mumbai Police website as per the Motor Vehicles Act, they explicitly do not state any penalties against bicyclists for certain offenses. Despite not being mandated in the Motor Vehicles Act and not having the constitutional authority, the Mumbai Police traffic department has been involved in impounding bicycles caught in traffic violations, including riding on prohibited roads, drunken pedaling/riding, obstructing traffic by stunt performing, and hit-and-run of law enforcement officials when trying to pull over bicyclists.

The Mumbai Police has also slammed for incidents of moral policing, which have resulted in serious protests, as well as intervention of judiciary and senior officers -

* In September 2000, the officials banned kissing in the Marine Drive area. They cited the Section 110 of Mumbai Police Act, 1951 which allows the police to interfere in &quot;disorderly behaviour.&quot; The decree was later withdrawn after protests.
* In 2012, Assistant Commissioner of Police Vasant Dhoble carried out a series of raids on bars and clubs in and around Mumbai, claiming to rescue prostitutes. In one instance, he labelled four German women wrongly as sex workers in front of cameras when he arrested them on 30 March 2014 from the Voodoo pub. On 5 June 2012, Dhoble raided Masala Curry restaurant after he felt suspicious of women being allowed free entry. Two cousins who were picked up in the raid later filed a defamation case against Dhoble. Due to intense criticism from several civilians, lawyers and activists, and following pressure on the department with lawsuits, Dhoble was fired from the Social Service Branch and transferred.
* On 6 August 2015, Malwani police in Mumbai, raided hotels and guest houses near Aksa Beach and Madh Island, and detained about 40 couples. Most of them were consenting couples in private rooms, but they were charged under Section 110 (Indecent behaviour in public) of the Bombay Police Act and fined . Only three cases were filed under Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act. Due to protests and criticism, then Commissioner Rakesh Maria order an investigation into the raids. Following a thorough investigation, Maria sent an order department wide not to use the Section 110 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 as well as sections 292 to 294 of the Indian Penal Code, which is an offense of Public Indecency to harass citizens and moral police them.
* On 27 December 2015, a senior police inspector along with constable were caught moral policing and thrashing a youth, besides verbally abusing his female friend in Ulhasnagar. The act of moral policing was heavily criticized after a video of the thrashing went viral.
* On 11 February 2024, 3 days before Valentines Day, several personnel from Mumbai police were accused of heckling and extorting money from the couples kissing or hugging in the gardens. Police personnel were keeping an eye on couples and harassed them if the couples were caught kissing or holding hands.

The Mumbai Police has also faced condemnation from the judiciary, National Human Rights Commission, leaders of opposition, besides the general public for taking actions on the orders of political leaders. Additionally, the department has faced criticism for inaction against political leaders for offensive statements and those who have serious criminal charges against them. -

* On 18 November 2012, following the death of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, Mumbai Police, under the pressure of Shiv Sena workers and activists, arrested a 21-year-old woman who posted a Facebook comment against him, as well as her friend who &quot;liked&quot; the comment. The charges were subsequently dropped in January 2013, and in July 2014, the Government of Maharashtra was ordered to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to each victim after the National Human Rights Commission noted that the detention was illegal and violated rights to freedom of speech and expression.
* On 14 May 2022, Marathi television actress Ketaki Chitale was arrested by Mumbai Police for allegedly sharing an objectionable post about Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar. Chitale, who was molested, and her modesty was outraged by the NCP workers, and was later granted bail, was booked under IPC sections 500 (defamation), 501 (printing or engraving defamatory matter) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code.
* On 10 February 2025, the Mumbai Police issued summons and paid a visit to YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia, popularly known as BeerBiceps, for offensive and vulgar remarks on an episode of India&#x27;s Got Latent, along with the host and comedian Samay Raina, and social media influencers Ashish Chanchlani, Apoorva Mukhija and Jaspreet Singh. While Allahbadia faced severe public criticism and issued a public apology, the department faced backlash for swift action against the show hosts and judges, as several critics and public figures stated that such quick action is not taken against political leaders who make such offensive, vulgar, and insensitive comments, and that law enforcement and judiciary acts quickly against such events, but not against crimes as serious as rape.

<doc id="439984" wikidata="Q1091176" url="?curid=439984" title="Smarandache–Wellin number">
<text>In mathematics, a Smarandache–Wellin number is an integer that in a given base is the concatenation of the first &quot;n&quot; prime numbers written in that base. Smarandache–Wellin numbers are named after Florentin Smarandache and Paul R. Wellin.

The first decimal Smarandache–Wellin numbers are:

:2, 23, 235, 2357, 235711, 23571113, 2357111317, 235711131719, 23571113171923, 2357111317192329, ... .

== Smarandache–Wellin prime ==
A Smarandache–Wellin number that is also prime is called a Smarandache–Wellin prime. The first three are 2, 23 and 2357 . The fourth is 355 digits long: it is the result of concatenating the first 128 prime numbers, through 719.

The primes at the end of the concatenation in the Smarandache–Wellin primes are
:2, 3, 7, 719, 1033, 2297, 3037, 11927, ... .

The indices of the Smarandache–Wellin primes in the sequence of Smarandache–Wellin numbers are:
:1, 2, 4, 128, 174, 342, 435, 1429, ... .

The 1429th Smarandache–Wellin number is a probable prime with 5719 digits ending in 11927, discovered by Eric W. Weisstein in 1998. If it is proven prime, it will be the eighth Smarandache–Wellin prime. In March 2009, Weisstein&#x27;s search showed the index of the next Smarandache–Wellin prime (if one exists) is at least 22077.

<text>Pueblo ( ) is a town, and surrounding municipality of the same name, in the Mexican state of Yucatán.

At the census of 2010, the town had a population of 4,080 people.

Chicxulub is most famous for being near the geographic center of the Chicxulub crater, an impact crater discovered by geologists on the Yucatán Peninsula and extending into the ocean. It was created by the impact some 66 million years ago of the Chicxulub impactor, an asteroid or comet which caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which led to the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs and other animals that dominated the Mesozoic. The coastal village (or &quot;puerto&quot;) of Chicxulub, in the neighboring municipality of Progreso, lies almost exactly on the geographic center of the crater.

The name is from the Yucatec Maya language meaning &#x27;the devil&#x27;s flea&#x27;.

<text>Sciadopitys verticillata, the  or Japanese umbrella-pine, is a unique conifer endemic to Japan, Sakhalin, and Kuril Islands. It is the sole living member of the family Sciadopityaceae and genus &quot;Sciadopitys&quot;, a living fossil with no close relatives. The oldest fossils of &quot;Sciadopitys&quot; are from the Late Cretaceous of Japan, and the genus was widespread in Laurasia during most of the Cenozoic, especially in Europe until the Pliocene. An extinct European relative of this species may have been the primary producer of Baltic amber.

Molecular evidence indicates that Sciadopityaceae is the sister group to a clade comprising Taxaceae and Cupressaceae, and has an extremely ancient divergence, having diverged from the rest of the conifers during the early mid-Permian.

There is inconsistent evidence regarding the plant family which produced Baltic amber. Both macrofossil and microfossil evidence suggest a &quot;Pinus&quot; relative, whereas chemical and infrared microspectroscopy evidence suggest relatives of either &quot;Agathis&quot; or &quot;Sciadopitys&quot;.
==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Sciadopitys&quot; comes from Greek () meaning &#x27;umbrella&#x27; and () meaning &#x27;pine&#x27;. The species name &quot;verticillata&quot; is a descriptive epithet meaning &#x27;whorled&#x27;.

==Description==
It is an evergreen tree that can grow 15–27 m tall, with brown main shoots bearing whorls of 7–12 cm long flexible green that look like, and perform the function of, leaves, but are actually composed of stem tissues. The cones are 6–11 cm long, mature in about 18 months, with flattish scales that open to release the seeds.

==History==
The plant was first introduced to the UK by John Gould Veitch in September 1860. Considered attractive, this tree is popular in gardens, despite its slow growth rate. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

A stylized representation of the tree (known in Japanese as ) was chosen as the Japanese Imperial crest for the Akishino branch of the Imperial Family.

<text>Nike Air Force is a range of athletic shoes made by Nike. It was created by designer Bruce Kilgore and was the first basketball shoe to use Nike&#x27;s &quot;Air&quot; technology. The shoe is offered in low-, mid- and high-top styles.

==Description==
The shoes are sold in 3 different styles: low, mid, and high. The mid comes with a connected strap. The high-top Air Force 1s come with a velcro strap; the mid-top strap is secured to the shoe while the high-top&#x27;s strap is movable and removable on some versions. Although the shoe comes in different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1s sold are solid white (also referred to as &quot;white on white&quot;), the second most common being solid black (&quot;black on black&quot;). Another identifying characteristic of an Air Force 1 shoe is a small medallion secured to the bottom of the laces but with holes on both sides so it can be removed by sliding it off the shoe lace. The medallion is engraved with the inscription &quot;AF-1&quot;, with the year &quot;&#x27;82&quot; inscribed beside it, which has historically been colored silver.

==Models==
===Air Force 1===
The Nike Air Force 1 was designed by Bruce Kilgore in 1982. The name is a reference to Air Force One, the plane that carries the President of the United States. Nike Air Force 1s were ubiquitous in Harlem, New York, giving rise to the nickname &quot;Uptowns&quot;.

The Air Force 1 began production in 1982 but was discontinued in 1984. It was re-introduced in 1986 with the modern italic Nike logo with a &quot;Swoosh&quot; revenue on the bottom of the back of the shoe. Little has changed to the Air Force One since its creation in 1982, although the stitching on the side panels of earlier versions is no longer present. Since its creation over 1,700 color variations have been produced, bringing in an estimated annual revenue of by 2007.

===Air Force 2===
The Air Force 2 shoe introduced in 1987 is a newer variation of the original. The shoe is a typical flat-soled, casual-wear sneaker that can be made in many different variations of colors. Also, Air Force 2s were re-released internationally in the early 2000s. They can be made in either the low-cut or high-top style.

The shoe can be custom made in any color, but typically it has either a white or black based background with almost any color used to fill in the Nike Swoosh and back heel.

===Air Force 3===
The Air Force 3 introduced in 1988 was the most popular version of the Air Force series. It was worn by many basketball players at the time. The Air Force III was more rugged looking and more durable than the previous two versions. The original colorway was white/medium grey/black, however several other colors were introduced shortly after. An actual &quot;Air FORCE&quot; logo was introduced on this model as well, with an image of half of a basketball on the tongue. This logo would be used on the rest of the Air Force series. The Air Force III was re-issued in 2006 in a very limited edition of colorways for the high top, and several colorways for the low top version.

===Air Force STS===
The Air Force STS (also known as Air Force 4 or Air Force IV) was introduced in 1989. It may be a reference to the Space Transportation System, the official name for the Space Shuttle. It was regularly worn by David Robinson in his rookie year. The Air Force STS features Nike&#x27;s elephant print and is also slightly higher than the first three versions of the Air Force series.

===Air Force 5===
The Air Force 5 was introduced in 1990. The Air Force V was the first model to make the airbag visible on the side heels of the shoe. The most popular colorway was white/medium grey/black/orange. Just like the previous version it was slightly higher than the first three versions.

===Air Force 180===
The Air Force 180 was introduced in 1991. The new shoe followed the same design as the previous model with a visible air unit and featured a synthetic upper. This model also came in three versions. One with a velcro strap across the laces and another with a special pump unit to inflate the shoe with air.

===Retro versions===
In 2007, for the 25th anniversary of Air Force 1, Nike created the Air Force XXV, which took inspiration from the original model. This version featured a mismatched set of medallions to commemorate its twenty fifth anniversary; one being from the original Air Force 1s with the other from the Air Force 25s. 

To further commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Air Force 1, two high-end makes of the shoe were introduced. They were made in Italy, one from crocodile leather and the other from anaconda leather, and were adorned with gold aglets. They were sold in limited quantities and had a list price of $2000, making them some of the most expensive Nike sneakers sold at retail.

In 2009, Nike created Air Force 09, an update of the original shoe. The shoe comes in solid black or white.

In 2010, Nike commissioned DJ Clark Kent to design a Nike Air Force 1 Low pack of special limited edition Air Force 1 shoes.

In 2017, Nike partnered with Don C, Kareem &quot;Biggs&quot; Burke, Errolson Hugh, Travis Scott and Virgil Abloh for the 35th anniversary of the shoe.

==Performance use==

As a performance shoe, the AF1 is still used for street play as well as for professional play. NBA players Jerry Stackhouse (who now wears Adidas) and Rasheed Wallace have worn AF1s on the court. The shoe is also used for fashion and casual wear.

==Aftermarket sales==
The selling of the Air Force Ones online by some retailers used to be prohibited by Nike, which restricted supply; the shoe may now be sold online. The Air Force One has become a favorite of sneaker collectors, often referred to as sneakerheads. Despite certain prohibition of sales in the early-production stage, Air Force (specifically Air Force 1) still stands as the top seller for NIKE and resellers since its release. Certain rare styles can cost several times their retail value.

==Lawsuit==
Nike has vigorously defended the Air Force 1 in U.S. courts. In one case, it sued an alleged infringer of its trademark in the Air Force 1, who responded by filing a counterclaim to invalidate the Air Force 1 trademark. Several months later, fearful that the defendant&#x27;s counterclaim could succeed, Nike suddenly gave the defendant an extremely broad &quot;Covenant Not To Sue&quot;, then moved to dismiss all its own claims with prejudice and to also dismiss the defendant&#x27;s counterclaim. The issue that went up on appeal was whether these tactics had thereby rendered the entire dispute moot (meaning there was no longer an active case or controversy), so that the U.S. federal courts had been deprived of jurisdiction to hear the defendant&#x27;s counterclaim. On January 9, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Nike&#x27;s favor.

==In popular culture==
St. Louis rapper Nelly and his group, St. Lunatics, released a 2002 single titled &quot;Air Force Ones&quot; about the shoes. The shoe is also a focus of 2007 single &quot;Classic (Better Than I&#x27;ve Ever Been)&quot;, a collaboration between Kanye West, Nas, Rakim and KRS-One. &quot;Black Air Force 2s&quot; are mentioned in the second line of the lyrics of the 2008 single &quot;Dope Boys&quot;, released from The Game&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;LAX&quot;.

From 2008 to 2014, Jax Teller (played by Charlie Hunnam) wears his trademark white-on-white retro low-top Air Force 1s throughout &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, until they are discarded in the final episode of the series.

In 2016, Quicksilver (played by actor Evan Peters) uses a custom silver-colored Air Force 1 in the movie &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;.

In the late 2010s and 2020s, the slang term &quot;black Air Force energy&quot; – in reference to the black-on-black styling of the shoe – described someone or something that was wild, aggressive, and had flagrant disregard and contempt for others and established rules.

<text>A dietitian, medical dietitian, or dietician is an expert in identifying and treating disease-related malnutrition and in conducting medical nutrition therapy, for example designing an enteral tube feeding regimen or mitigating the effects of cancer cachexia. Many dietitians work in hospitals and usually see specific patients where a nutritional assessment and intervention has been requested by a doctor or nurse, for example if a patient has lost their ability to swallow or requires artificial nutrition due to intestinal failure. Dietitians are regulated healthcare professionals licensed to assess, diagnose, and treat such problems. In the United Kingdom, dietitian is a &#x27;protected title&#x27;, meaning identifying yourself as a dietitian without appropriate education and registration is prohibited by law.

A registered dietitian (RD) (UK/USA) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) (USA) meets all of a set of special academic and professional requirements, including the completion of a bachelor&#x27;s and/or master&#x27;s degree in nutrition and dietetics (or equivalent). One or more internships (USA) or clinical placements (UK) must also be completed. These may be allocated and monitored by the university as part of the structured degree programme (UK) or may be applied for separately (USA).

Roughly half of all RD(N)s hold graduate degrees and many have certifications in specialized fields such as nutrition support, sports, paediatrics, renal, oncological, food-allergy, or gerontological nutrition. Although assessment priorities differ depending on the specialist area, a patient&#x27;s medical and surgical history, biochemistry, diet history, eating and exercise habits usually form the basis of assessment. The RD(N) negotiates a treatment plan with the patient which may include prescriptions, and follow-up visits often focus on maintenance and monitoring progress.

Most RDs work in the treatment and prevention of disease (administering medical nutrition therapy, as part of medical teams), often in hospitals, health-maintenance organizations, private practices, or other health-care facilities. In addition, many registered dietitians work in community and public-health settings, and/or in academia and research. A growing number of dietitians work in the food industry, journalism, sports nutrition, corporate wellness programs, and other non-traditional dietetics settings.

==The spellings &quot;dietitian&quot; and &quot;dietician&quot;==
As explained by the American Heritage and Merriam-Webster&#x27;s dictionaries, the cause of the confusion is that the spelling with &quot;-tian&quot; is an irregular alteration of the ending &quot;-cian&quot;, which is otherwise exclusively used to refer to specialists and practitioners of other professions. These and other American dictionaries also list the spelling with &quot;c&quot; but list the spelling with &quot;t&quot; first because this spelling is more common in the United States. Nevertheless, the American publisher McGraw-Hill exclusively uses the spelling with &quot;c&quot; in the 2003 edition of the &quot;McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms&quot; and the 2002 edition of the McGraw-Hill &quot;Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine&quot;.

The spelling with &quot;t&quot; is the one preferred by the profession itself internationally, but the spelling with &quot;c&quot; is used often enough in texts not written by members of the profession to be considered a valid variant by both American and British dictionaries. In fact, British dictionaries list the spelling with &quot;c&quot; first and list the spelling with &quot;t&quot; as a variant. American dictionaries list the spelling with &quot;t&quot; first and the spelling with &quot;c&quot; as a variant.

As explained in a 2010 newsletter of the International Confederation of Dietetic Associations:

ILO has however also issued new documents using the spelling &quot;dietician&quot;.

==World Health Organization classification==
Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, develop modified diets, participate in research, and educate individuals and groups on good nutritional habits. The goals of dietitians are to provide medical nutritional intervention, and to obtain, safely prepare, serve and advise on flavorsome, attractive, and nutritious food for patients, groups and communities. Dietary modification to address medical issues involving dietary intake is a major part of dietetics (the study of nutrition as it relates to health). For example, working in consultation with physicians and other health care providers, a dietitian may provide specific artificial nutritional needs to patients unable to consume food normally. Professional dietitians may also provide specialist services such as in diabetes, obesity, oncology, osteoporosis, pediatrics, renal disease, and micronutrient research.

Different professional terms are used in different countries and employment settings, for example, clinical dietitian, community dietitian, dietetic educator, food-service dietitian, registered dietitian, public health dietitian, therapeutic dietitian, or research dietitian. In many countries, only people who have specified educational credentials and other professional requirements can call themselves &quot;dietitians&quot;—the title is legally protected. The term &quot;nutritionist&quot; is also widely used; however, the terms &quot;dietitian&quot; and &quot;nutritionist&quot; should not be considered interchangeable—the training, regulation and scope of practice of the two professional titles can be very different across individuals and jurisdictions.

In many countries, the majority of dietitians are &quot;clinical&quot; or &quot;therapeutic&quot; dietitians, such as the case of the United States, the United Kingdom, and much of Africa. In other countries they are mostly foodservice dietitians, such as in Japan and many European countries.

==Dietitians in practice==

===Clinical dietitians===
Clinical dietitians work in hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing care facilities and other health care facilities to provide nutrition therapy to patients with a variety of health conditions, and provide dietary consultations to patients and their families. They confer with other health care professionals to review patients&#x27; medical charts and develop individual plans to meet nutritional requirements. Some clinical dietitians will also create or deliver outpatient or public education programs in health and nutrition. Clinical dietitians may provide specialized services in areas of nourishment and diets, tube feedings (called enteral nutrition), and intravenous feedings (called parenteral nutrition) such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN). They work as a team with the physicians, physician assistants, physical therapists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, pharmacists, speech therapists, social workers, nurses, dietetic technicians, psychologists and other specialists to provide care to patients. Some clinical dietitians have dual responsibilities with patient nutrition therapy and in food service or research (described below).

===Community dietitians===
Community dietitians work with wellness programs, public health agencies, home care agencies, and health maintenance organizations. These dietitians apply and distribute knowledge about food and nutrition to individuals and groups of specific categories, life-styles and geographic areas in order to promote health. They often focus on the needs of the elderly, children, or other individuals with special needs or limited access to healthy food. Some community dietitians conduct home visits for patients who are too physically ill to attend consultations in health facilities in order to provide care and instruction on grocery shopping and food preparation.

===Foodservice dietitians===
Foodservice dietitians or managers are responsible for large-scale food planning and service. They coordinate, assess and plan foodservice processes in health care facilities, school food-service programs, prisons, restaurants, and company cafeterias. These dietitians may perform audits of their departments to ensure quality control and food safety standards, and launch new menus and various programs within their institution to meet health and nutritional requirements. They train and supervise other food service workers such as kitchen staff, delivery staff, and dietary assistants or aides.

===Gerontological dietitians===
Gerontological dietitians are specialists in nutrition and aging. They work in nursing homes, community-based aged care agencies, government agencies in aging policy, and in higher education in the field of gerontology (the study of aging).

===Neonatal dietitians===
Neonatal dietitians provide individualized medical nutrition therapy for critically ill premature newborns. They are considered a part of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit&#x27;s medical team. The neonatal dietitian performs clinical assessment of patients, designs nutrition protocols and quality improvement initiatives with the medical team, develops enteral and parenteral regimens, helps establish and promote lactation/breastfeeding guidelines and often oversees the management of infection prevention in the handling, storage, and delivery of nutritional products.

===Pediatric dietitians===
Pediatric dietitians provide nutrition and health advice for infants, children, and adolescents. They focus on early nutritional needs, and often work closely with doctors, school health services, clinics, hospitals and government agencies, in developing and implementing treatment plans for children with eating disorders, food allergies, or any condition where a child&#x27;s diet factors into the equation, such as childhood obesity.

===Research dietitians===
Research dietitians may focus on social sciences or health services research, for example, investigate the impact of health policies or behaviour change, or evaluate program effectiveness. They may survey food-service systems management in order to guide quality improvement. Some research dietitians study the biochemical aspects of nutrient interaction within the body. In universities, they also may have teaching responsibilities. Some clinical dietitians&#x27; roles involve research in addition to their patients care workload.

===Administrative dietitians===
Administrative or management dietitians oversee and direct all aspects of clinical dietetics service, food policy and/or large-scale meal service operations in hospitals, government agencies, company cafeterias, prisons, and schools. They recruit, train and supervise employees of dietetics departments including dietitians and other personnel. They set department goals, policies and procedures; procurement, equipment and supplies; ensure safety and sanitation standards in foodservice; and administer budget management.

===Business dietitians===
Business dietitians serve as resource people in food and nutrition through business, marketing and communications. Dietitians&#x27; expertise in nutrition is often solicited in the media—for example for expert guest opinions on television and radio news or cooking shows, columns for a newspaper or magazine, or resources for restaurants on recipe development and critique. Business dietitians may author books or corporate newsletters on nutrition and wellness. They also work as sales representatives for food manufacturing companies that provide nutritional supplements and tube feeding supplies.

===Consultant dietitians===
Consultant dietitians are those who are in private practice or practice on a contractual basis with health care facilities or corporations, such as used in Australia, Canada and the United States. Consultant dietitians contract independently to provide nutrition or health related consultation and educational programs to individuals and health care facilities as well as sports teams, fitness clubs, and other health related businesses and corporations.

==Required qualifications and professional associations==
In most countries, competent performance as a dietitian requires formal training at a higher educational institution in dietetics involving food and nutritional science, nutrition education and medical nutrition therapy. Their education in health science involves scientific based knowledge in anatomy, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and physiology.

While the specific academic and professional requirements to becoming a fully qualified dietitian differ across countries and jurisdictions, as these are adapted to the needs of the individual countries and the opportunities available, common academic routes include:

*A bachelor degree in dietetics which requires four years of special studies such as anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, biochemistry/metabolism, biology, microbiology, organic chemistry, nutritional sciences, food science, medical nutrition therapy; &quot;or&quot;
*A Bachelor of Science degree and a postgraduate diploma or master&#x27;s degree in dietetics.

In addition, clinical/medical dietitians are required to undergo an internship in a hospital to learn counseling skills with patients and aspects of psychology. The internship process differs across countries and jurisdictions.

Associations for dietetics professionals exist in many countries on every continent.

===Australia===
Accredited Practising Dietitians (APDs) in Australia gain their qualifications through university courses accredited by Dietitians Australia (DA). In order for patients to receive a rebate from the national Medicare system or private health insurance, APD status is required. APDs are dietitians engaged in the Continuing Professional Development program offered by the DA and commit to upholding the DA Code of Professional Conduct and Code of Ethics.

Dietitians who are not members of DA may participate in the DA&#x27;s Continuing Professional Development Program and in this way can still hold APD status. However, health care providers must, as of 2009, either have statutory registration or be members of their national professional association to obtain a provider number. This means all private health funds will require private practitioners applying for provider numbers to be Dietitians Australia members (not just &quot;eligible&quot; for membership).

===Canada===
In Canada, &#x27;dietitian&#x27; is a protected professional title. Additionally, &#x27;registered dietitian&#x27; and &#x27;professional dietitian&#x27; are protected in some provinces. Each province has an independent professional college (for example, The College of Dietitians of Ontario) which is responsible for protecting the public and regulating the profession. The colleges are entirely funded from licensing fees collected from dietitians. Each college must have both public and professional members, and is empowered to investigate and censure (when malpractice/negligence is found) members of the profession who breach either their scope of practice or harm/endanger the health of a patient/client, and receive a complaint against them from a member of the public or another health care professional. To practice as a registered dietitian within a province, a dietitian must register with the college and obtain a license. The activities of the college are governed by legislation passed by the provincial government. It is the presence of this regulatory body which distinguishes registered dietitians from nutritionists in Canada, the regulations for which vary by province (Exceptions: Alberta where &quot;registered nutritionist&quot; is a protected title that can only be used by dietitians. Similarly in Nova Scotia and Québec &quot;nutritionist&quot; is protected and can only be used by dietitians)

The colleges also set the minimum entry requirements for admission into practice as a registered dietitian. Requirements to entry into practice as a dietitian include a four-year undergraduate degree from an accredited university (which includes courses in science, foods, nutrition, management, communication and psychology/sociology, among others), a 10–12 month supervised practice period (called an internship), and successfully passing a board exam in nutrition and dietetics.

The national professional association in Canada is Dietitians of Canada.

===Malaysia===
====History of Dietitians in Malaysia====
Hospital dietetic services began in Malaysia in 1953 under the Ministry of Health. In 1965 dietetics services began in university hospitals and in private hospitals in 1982. In 1988, University Kebangsaan Malaysia started the first dietetics program to train dietitians. There are currently eight universities in Malaysia offering programs in dietetics at at least a bachelor&#x27;s level. In 2005 the Ministry of Health recognized Dietitians under clinical and health services as an allied healthcare professional.

====Regulation of Dietitians and Nutritionists in Malaysia====
Dietitians and nutritionists are regulated under the Allied Health Professional Act in Malaysia. Using the term &quot;registered&quot; is regulated and falsely presenting oneself as a registered dietitian/nutritionist in Malaysia is illegal. Practicing certificates are valid for two years. Practitioners must register with the Malaysian Allied Health Professionals Council.

====Pathways to Becoming a Dietitian in Malaysia====
There are three pathways to becoming a Registered Dietitian in Malaysia:

# Obtain a 4-year integrated undergraduate degree in Dietetics (with proof of having done Dietetics Internship Training) as the following: Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Dietetics or Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Nutrition &amp; Dietetics
# Obtain integrated postgraduate degree or master&#x27;s degree in Dietetics with proof of having done Dietetics Internship Training
# Postgraduate Diploma with proof of having done Dietetics Internship Training

===South Africa===
In South Africa, dietitians must be registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa. The council regulates the following professional titles: dietitians, supplementary dietitians, and student dietitians, as well as nutritionists, supplementary nutritionists, and student nutritionists. Requirements for eligibility for registration include a recognised bachelor&#x27;s degree in dietetics or nutrition from an accredited educational institution. The undergraduate training should include the three practice areas of therapeutic nutrition, community nutrition, and food service management.

Against the backdrop of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa, there remains high demand for greater numbers of practicing dietitians, along with other health care staff, in order to expand public sector health care services.

Academic programs, professional associations, and credentialing requirements do not exist for dietitians in most other African countries, where the number of professionals in dietetics is very low.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, dietitians must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC, formerly the Health Professions Council, HPC) in order to be able to work for the National Health Service. The education requirements include obtaining either a BSc in dietetics or a postgraduate qualification approved by the HCPC.

===United States===
In the United States, nutrition professionals include the dietitian or registered dietitian (RD), as well as &quot;dietetic technician&quot; or &quot;dietetic technician, registered&quot; (DTR) (see below). These terms are legally protected, regulated by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics which registers and confers professional credentials. The academy also recognizes and certifies certain specialty areas, such as in gerontological nutrition.

Dietitians are registered with the Commission on Dietetic Registration (the certifying agency of the academy) and are only able to use the label &quot;Registered Dietitian&quot; when they have met specific educational and professional prerequisites and passed a national registration examination. Besides academic education, dietitians must complete at least 1200 hours of practical, supervised experience through an accredited program before they can sit for the registration examination. In a coordinated program, students acquire internship hours concurrently with their coursework. In a didactic program, these hours are obtained through a dietetic internship that is completed after obtaining a degree. In both programs the student is required to complete several areas of competency including rotations in clinical, community, long-term care nutrition as well as food service, public health and a variety of other worksites.

Once the degree is earned, the internship completed, and registration examination passed, the individual can use the nationally recognized legal title, &quot;registered dietitian&quot;, and is able to work in a variety of professional settings. To maintain the RD credential, professionals must participate in and earn continuing education units (often 75 hours every five years).

In addition, many states require specific licensure to work in most settings. For instance, the California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8, states that:

In addition: 

As recent studies have shown the importance of diet in both disease prevention and management, many US states have moved towards covering medical nutrition therapy under the Medicaid/Medicare social insurance programs, making dietetics a much more lucrative profession due to insurance reimbursement.

In the United States the governing body of dietetics practice is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the ADA). This group is made up of approximately 72,000 members nationwide.

===International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (ICDA)===
The International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (ICDA) is a membership organization of over 40 national associations of dietitians and nutritionists. Dietetics associations are professional societies whose members have education qualifications in food, nutrition and dietetics recognized by a national authority.

The ICDA supports national dietetics associations and their members, beyond national and regional boundaries, by providing:
* An integrated communications system
* An enhanced image for the profession
* Increased awareness of standards of education, training and practice in dietetics.

==Other nutrition personnel==
These titles are general designations of nutrition personnel. Specific titles may vary across countries, jurisdictions and employment settings. In particular the title nutritionist is, in some countries, unregulated so anyone may claim to be a nutritionist.

===Dietetic technicians===
Dietetic technicians are involved in planning, implementing and monitoring nutritional programs and services in facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. They assist in education and assessment of clients&#x27; dietary needs, and may specialize in nutritional care or foodservice management. Dietetic technicians usually work with, and under the supervision of, a registered dietitian.

The training requirements and professional regulation of dietetic technicians vary across countries, but usually include some formal (postsecondary) training in dietetics and nutrition care. In jurisdictions where the profession is regulated, such as in the United States, the title &quot;Dietetic Technician, Registered&quot; (DTR) may be used.

====Canada====
In Canada, there are national standards for academic training and qualifications for dietetic technicians, according to CSNM (the Canadian Society for Nutrition Management). In Ontario, Conestoga College offers a diploma program with a clinical focus for dietetic technicians.

====United States====
In the United States, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics confers the &quot;Dietetic Technician, Registered&quot; (DTR) credentials. Qualified DTRs possess a specialized associate degree from community college programs which are accredited by the academy&#x27;s Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND). They must complete a dietetic internship with a minimum of 450 supervised practice hours in the areas of foodservice theory and management, community dietetics, and clinical dietetics. They must also pass a national registration examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) of the academy. The DTR is an academy-credentialed nutrition practitioner who works independently in many nutrition settings; however, when performing clinical dietetics, they must work under the supervision of a Registered Dietitian. Some states have legislation specifying the scope of practice for the DTR in medical nutrition therapy settings.

Effective June 1, 2009, a new pathway to becoming a Registered Dietetic Technician became available from the Commission on Dietetic Registration. Students may take the DTR examination without attending an internship after completion of a Baccalaureate degree granted by a US regionally accredited college/university, or foreign equivalent, and completion of an ACEND Didactic Program in dietetics or Coordinated Program in dietetics. Applicants must take and pass the CDR Dietetic Technician Registration Exam to qualify for the DTR credential.

As for Registered Dietitians, in many cases the title &quot;Dietetic Technician&quot; is regulated by individual states. For instance, according to the California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8:

===Dietary assistants===
Dietary assistants, also known as &quot;nutrition assistants&quot; or &quot;dietary aides&quot;, assist dietitians and other nutrition professionals to maintain nutritional care for patients and groups with special dietary needs. They assist in preparing food in hospitals, childcare centres, and aged care facilities.

Dietary aides in some countries might also carry out a simple initial health screening for newly admitted patients in medical facilities, and inform the dietitian if any screened patients requires a dietitian&#x27;s expertise for further assessments or interventions.

===Dietary clerks===
&quot;Dietary clerks&quot;, also sometimes known as &quot;medical diet clerks&quot; or &quot;dietary workers&quot;, prepare dietary information for use by kitchen personnel in preparation of foods for hospital patients following standards established by a dietitian. They examine diet orders, prepare meal trays, maintain the storage area for food supplies, and ensure practice of sanitary procedures. They may operate computers to enter and retrieve data on patients&#x27; caloric requirements and intake, or to track financial information. Dietary workers are typically trained on the job.

===Dietary managers===

Dietary managers supervise the production and distribution of meals, as well as the budgeting and purchasing of food and the hiring, training and scheduling of support staff in various types of workplaces offering larger scale foodservices, such as hospitals, nursing homes, school and college cafeterias, restaurants, correction facilities and catering services. They assure their department is compliant with food safety regulations, and that the food served meets dietary requirements established by a dietitian.

Training requirements vary across jurisdictions and employment settings. Dietary management is not usually subject to professional regulation, although voluntary certification is preferred by many employers.
* In Canada, dietary managers with recognized training in areas such as diet therapy, menu planning, food safety and food production may become members of the Canadian Society of Nutrition Management (CSNM).
* In the United States, &quot;Certified Dietary Managers&quot; are certified by the credentialing agency known as the Association of Nutrition &amp; Foodservice Professionals (ANFP). This agency also certifies a professional known as a &quot;Certified Food Protection Professional&quot;. The ANFP certifies specific programs to meet its educational requirements, including courses in culinary management, clinical nutrition, and food safety. In addition, there are supervised practice requirements and a certification exam that must be passed.

===Dietary hosts===
Dietary hosts/hostesses, also known as &quot;food service aides&quot;, assist in patient tray services in hospitals and other health care settings, usually under the supervision of the dietary manager. They distribute menus, and prepare, deliver and bring back meal trays. Usually no specific training is required for workers in this category.

<text>Christopher John Grace ( ; born July 12, 1978) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as Eric Forman in the teen sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (1998–2005) and Eddie Brock / Venom in Sam Raimi&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007). He has also starred in the crime drama &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000), the drama &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003), the romantic comedies &quot;Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!&quot; (2004), &quot;In Good Company&quot; (2004) and &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), and the action film &quot;Predators&quot; (2010). He has since had supporting roles in the science fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014) and crime drama &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; (2018). From 2021 to 2023, he played the lead role in the ABC comedy series &quot;Home Economics&quot;.

==Early life==
Grace was born on July 12, 1978, in New York City, the son of Pat, an assistant to the schoolmaster of the New Canaan Country School, and John Grace, a Madison Avenue executive. He has a sister, Jenny. His paternal grandmother was from a German-Jewish family, whereas his mother is of Irish descent.

Grace grew up in Darien, Connecticut, where actress Kate Bosworth was a middle-school friend, and actress Chloë Sevigny—who later appeared with him in high school stage plays—was sometimes his babysitter.

==Career==
Grace was cast as Eric Forman on Fox&#x27;s &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, which debuted in 1998. He played the role regularly until the show&#x27;s 7th season, when his character was written out and replaced with a new character named Randy Pearson (Josh Meyers). Grace made a brief guest appearance in the final episode.

Grace played a prep school student who introduces his girlfriend to freebasing in director Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Traffic&quot;, as well as having uncredited cameos as himself in Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; and its 2004 sequel, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;. &quot;The joke is that you&#x27;re supposed to play the worst version of yourself and I don&#x27;t think too many people are comfortable with that. I never thought for a second that people were really going to think that&#x27;s what I was like. I think that people will know that I was faking it in those movies&quot;, he told &quot;Flaunt&quot; magazine in 2007.

He planned to cameo in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;. However, due to his role in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, he had to abandon these plans. As Grace said, &quot;I was doing reshoots on &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. I was bummed. I actually talked to Steven Soderbergh about that and we had a thing and then I couldn&#x27;t do it.&quot; He appeared in director Mike Newell&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;.
In 2004, Grace played the leading roles in &quot;Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!&quot; and &quot;In Good Company&quot;. That same year, he starred in &quot;P.S.&quot;, which received only a limited theatrical release. Grace won the National Board of Review&#x27;s 2004 award for Breakthrough Performance Actor for his work in &quot;In Good Company&quot; and &quot;P.S.&quot;

On January 15, 2005, Grace hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In 2007, Grace portrayed Eddie Brock/Venom in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, directed by Sam Raimi. Grace himself was a fan of the comics and read the Venom stories as a child. In 2009, Grace became the subject of a recurring column on the entertainment/pop culture site &quot;Videogum&quot;, entitled &quot;What&#x27;s Up With Topher Grace?&quot;

In 2010, Grace appeared in the ensemble comedy &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; and played the character of Edwin in &quot;Predators&quot;.

In 2011, Grace appeared in the 1980s retro comedy &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;. He co-wrote the script and co-produced the film. Grace also starred opposite Richard Gere in the spy thriller &quot;The Double&quot;.

In 2012, Grace starred alongside Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Matthew Gray Gubler in the social film &quot;The Beauty Inside&quot;, which won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding New Approach to an Original Daytime Program or Series in 2013. The film was directed by Drake Doremus and written by Richard Greenberg.

In 2014, Grace starred in the indie thriller &quot;The Calling&quot;, alongside Susan Sarandon, and appeared in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s sci-fi adventure &quot;Interstellar&quot;, in a supporting role.

In October 2013, Grace joined HBO comedy pilot &quot;People in New Jersey&quot; with Sarah Silverman, but in January 2014, the pilot was passed on.

Grace co-starred in the comedy film &quot;American Ultra&quot; (2015), alongside Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, playing a CIA agent. That same year, he co-starred in &quot;Truth&quot;, with Robert Redford and Cate Blanchett, based on the story of CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report that George W. Bush had received preferential treatment to keep him out of the Vietnam War. Grace played Mike Smith, a researcher on the story.

In January 2018, Grace joined the supernatural-thriller &quot;Delirium&quot;, which centers on a man recently released from a mental institute who inherits a mansion after his parents die. After a series of disturbing events, he comes to believe it is haunted. In August 2018, Grace portrayed David Duke in the biographical crime film &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;, directed by Spike Lee, alongside John David Washington and Adam Driver. In 2019, he played Billy Bauer in the 2nd episode of &quot;Black Mirror&quot;’s 5th season, titled &quot;Smithereens&quot;. 
In 2020, Grace was cast in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Home Economics&quot; pilot. On April 30, 2022, it was announced that Grace would have a guest appearance in the follow-up sitcom, &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot;.

=== Editing and &quot;Lou&#x27;s Cafe&quot; ===
Grace has long held an interest in making fan edits of popular films, particularly those involving &quot;Star Wars.&quot; He has stated that this has become a source of relaxation for him. His edits were shared on his now-defunct pop-culture website Cereal Prize.

In 2012, he edited the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy into one 85-minute film, titled &quot;Star Wars: Episode III.5: The Editor Strikes Back&quot; and showed it to select audiences. The edit utilized original footage, music from the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; series, and a portion from Anthony Daniels&#x27; audiobook recordings.

In 2014, he created a cut of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; that served as a reconstruction of the character Brock Landers&#x27; fake movie &quot;Angels Live in My Town&quot;.

In 2018, he created his own edit of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, stating that &quot;I think that maybe &quot;The Hobbit&quot; should&#x27;ve been one movie, and many people would agree. Money drives a lot of those franchises. It&#x27;s better when the art leads.&quot; He specifically edited this as a way to relax while portraying David Duke in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;.

In 2019, Grace and editor Jeff Yorkes started a Twitter account for &quot;Lou&#x27;s Cafe&quot;, the pseudonym by which the two credit their work. The name comes from the diner featured in the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Later that year, he and Yorkes were commissioned by Pixar to edit a retrospective for &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, which was titled &quot;Toy Story 4 Ever&quot; and released on Pixar&#x27;s YouTube account.

==Personal life==
Grace started dating actress Ashley Hinshaw in January 2014, and the two became engaged in January 2015. On May 29, 2016, Grace and Hinshaw married near Santa Barbara, California. They have two children and were expecting a third as of September 2022.

Grace is a supporter of FINCA International, a microfinance organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.finca.org/&quot;&gt;Topher Grace about FINCA on Jimmy Fallon , finca.org, March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Adam Matthew Vinatieri (born December 28, 1972) is an American former professional football placekicker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 24 seasons with the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts. Vinatieri is the NFL&#x27;s all-time leading scorer at 2,673 points, in addition to holding the NFL records for field goals made (599), postseason points (238), and overtime field goals made (12). He is considered one of the greatest placekickers of all time.

Vinatieri joined the Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 1996, where he played for 10 seasons, and was a member of the Colts for 14 seasons. A four-time Super Bowl winner – three with the Patriots and one with the Colts – he has the most Super Bowl wins for a kicker. He is also the only player to score 1,000 points for two different franchises. Retiring in 2021 after a year in free agency, Vinatieri was the last active player whose career began in the 1990s.

Celebrated for his kicking accuracy and success under pressure, Vinatieri completed several of the most crucial field goals in NFL history. During the 2001–02 NFL playoffs, he converted the game-tying and winning kicks of New England&#x27;s AFC Divisional Playoff game in blizzard conditions and the game-winning kick in the final seconds of Super Bowl XXXVI, earning the Patriots their first championship. He would again convert a final-second kick to win Super Bowl XXXVIII, establishing himself as a key contributor of the Patriots&#x27; dynasty. In the 2007 postseason, Vinatieri converted 14 of 15 field goal attempts (which included three field goals in Super Bowl XLI) to set a new record for most field goals in one postseason (Evan McPherson tied the record in 2022). In 2019, Vinatieri was named to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==Early life==
Vinatieri was born in Yankton, South Dakota, on December 28, 1972, the second child of four children to Paul Vinatieri and Judy M. (Goeken). His father is of Italian descent and his other ancestry includes German and English. His younger brother Beau was a kicker at Black Hills State University before graduating in 2003.

When Vinatieri was five years old, his family moved to Rapid City, South Dakota. As a child, he struggled to read and enrolled in classes for children with learning disabilities. Vinatieri attended Central High School in Rapid City and was a letterman in football, wrestling, basketball, soccer, and track. In football, he earned first-team All-State honors as a senior. He graduated from Central High School in 1991. Before starting as a kicker, Vinatieri was a quarterback and middle linebacker. When asked in 2005, several years into his NFL career, why he no longer played one of those positions once he reached college, he replied, &quot;I&#x27;m 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, and unfortunately the linebackers aren&#x27;t that small, and neither are the quarterbacks.&quot;

==College career==
Vinatieri received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was only there for two weeks before deciding to return home, where he then enrolled at South Dakota State University. He was a four-year letterman there as a kicker and punter and he finished his collegiate career as the school&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 185 career points as well as being awarded first-team all-conference honors in each of his seasons.

==Professional career==
===Amsterdam Admirals===
Vinatieri spent the summer of 1996 training to compete professionally. He received a tryout for the World League of American Football (later rebranded as NFL Europe), and earned a roster position with the Amsterdam Admirals as a kicker and punter.

===New England Patriots (1996–2005)===
Vinatieri played in New England for the first 10 years of his NFL career, during which he played in four Super Bowls, winning three titles.

====1996 season====
In 1996, Vinatieri was signed by the Patriots as an undrafted free agent to be a kicker. In order to become their starter, he had to compete with 17-year veteran Matt Bahr. Bahr at first seemed to be the favorite. He had a long history with Patriots coach Bill Parcells, including a Super Bowl win under Parcells in the 1990 season. However, Parcells ultimately made the decision to cut Bahr during the preseason and go with Vinatieri, mainly because Bahr was no longer capable of efficiently performing kickoffs.

In his rookie season, he chased down and tackled Dallas Cowboys returner Herschel Walker on a kickoff, leading Parcells to tell his rookie kicker &quot;You&#x27;re not a kicker—you&#x27;re a football player.&quot; In Week 4, Vinatieri converted five of six field goal attempts against the Jacksonville Jaguars, to earn AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. He converted the 40-yard game-winning field goal in overtime of the 28–25 victory. He finished his rookie season converting 39 of 42 extra point tries and 27 of 35 field goal attempts. His first Super Bowl appearance was in his rookie season of 1996 when he played with the Patriots in their 35–21 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI. All-Pro and game MVP Desmond Howard&#x27;s Super Bowl-record 99-yard touchdown return ended the Patriots&#x27; bid for a comeback. The game would mark the only Super Bowl defeat of Vinatieri&#x27;s career (he didn&#x27;t play in the Colts&#x27; loss in Super Bowl XLIV). Vinatieri was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.

====1997 season====
In Week 7 of the 1997 season, Vinatieri won AFC Special Teams Player of the Week after converting all three extra point tries and all four field goal attempts in the 33–6 victory over the Buffalo Bills. In the 1997 season, Vinatieri converted all 40 extra point attempts and 25 of 29 field goal attempts as the Patriots went 10–6 and earned a playoff berth. He was responsible for scoring all of the Patriots&#x27; points with two field goals in their game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Round.

====1998 season====
In Week 5 of the 1998 season, Vinatieri converted three extra point and three field goals tries in the 30–27 victory over the New Orleans Saints. His last field goal attempt was a 27-yarder with six seconds remaining to put the Patriots in position to win the game. He earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his game against New Orleans. The Saints game was the beginning of a month for Vinatieri where he won AFC Special Teams Player of the Month. He finished the 1998 season converting all 32 extra point attempts and 31 of 39 field goal attempts.

====1999 season====
In the 1999 season, Vinatieri won AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for September. He converted 29 of 30 extra point attempts and 26 of 33 field goal attempts as the Patriots went 8–8.

====2000 season====
In the 2000 season, Vinatieri converted all 25 extra point attempts and 27 of 33 field goal attempts in the Patriots&#x27; 5–11 season.

====2001 season====
In Week 14, Vinatieri converted all four field goal attempts in a 12–9 victory over the Buffalo Bills. The last of the four was the game-winner in overtime. He won AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his game against Buffalo. In the 2001 regular season, Vinatieri converted 41 of 42 extra point attempts and 24 of 30 field goal attempts. In the 2001 playoffs, during a blizzard against the Oakland Raiders in the final game at Foxboro Stadium, Vinatieri kicked a 45-yard field goal into a swirling winter wind to tie the game 13–13 and send it to overtime. The Patriots won the game on another field goal of 23 yards by Vinatieri. In Super Bowl XXXVI that season, Vinatieri kicked a 48-yard field goal on the final play to give the New England Patriots their first Super Bowl victory, a 20–17 upset win over the St. Louis Rams, who were 14-point favorites coming into the game.

====2002 season====
In Week 17, against the Miami Dolphins, Vinatieri converted all four field goal attempts in the 27–24 victory. The last of the four was the game-winner in overtime. He won AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his game against Miami. In the 2002 season, Vinatieri converted all 36 extra point tries and 27 of 30 field goal tries as the Patriots went 9–7 and missed the playoffs. He earned Pro Bowl and First Team All-Pro honors.

====2003 season====
In the 2003 regular season, Vinatieri converted 37 of 38 extra point tries and 25 of 34 field goal attempts. In an almost identical situation to the Super Bowl two seasons prior, he kicked a 41-yard field goal with four seconds left in Super Bowl XXXVIII to boost the Patriots to another championship (after missing one field goal and having another attempt blocked in the first half). This time, the Patriots defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29, making Vinatieri the first player ever to be the deciding factor in two Super Bowl games (Vinatieri kept the footballs used on both of these kicks).

====2004 season====

Vinatieri was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for November. In 2004, Vinatieri led the NFL in scoring with 141 points (31-for-33 on field goals, and a perfect 48-for-48 on extra point attempts). In a Week 9 game against the St. Louis Rams, Vinatieri scored 16 points (four field goals and four extra points), and threw a four-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Troy Brown on a fake field goal attempt (that pass gives him a career passer rating of 122.9). For his game against the Rams, he earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In Week 10, against the Buffalo Bills, he scored a career-high 17 points on five field goals and two extra points. He was named to the Pro Bowl and earned First Team All-Pro honors.

Vinatieri scored a field goal and three extra points in the Patriots 24–21 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX.

====2005 season====
In Week 3, Vinatieri earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He hit the game-winning field goal with one second remaining. In the 2005 season, Vinatieri converted 40 of 41 extra point attempts and 20 of 25 field goal attempts.

====Legacy====
By the time Vinatieri finished his final season with the Patriots in 2005, he had kicked 18 game-winning field goals with less than one minute remaining, including the postseason. At the conclusion of the 2005 season, he had a career field goal percentage of 81.9 percent (263/321), fifth-highest in NFL history. In his time in New England, his community involvement included helping Christian athletes, D.A.R.E., and the Governor&#x27;s Highway Safety Bureau. He was a spokesperson for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island&#x27;s teen anti-smoking contest, and also appeared in commercials for Boston-based pizza Papa Gino&#x27;s. Vinatieri finished his 10 seasons with the Patriots as the team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 1,156 points (that record was surpassed by Vinatieri&#x27;s replacement, Stephen Gostkowski, in 2014). His jersey number 4 was not reissued for the next 14 seasons until quarterback Jarrett Stidham wore it in 2019.

===Indianapolis Colts (2006–2019)===
====2006 season====

After the 2005 season, the Patriots chose not to place their franchise tag on Vinatieri as they had the year before, allowing him to become a free agent. He had met with the Green Bay Packers, but was set on signing in either a warm-weather climate or a team that played home games in a dome. On March 22, 2006, Vinatieri signed with the Indianapolis Colts, replacing Mike Vanderjagt, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys. Vinatieri was signed to a five-year contract and received a $3.5 million signing bonus.

&quot;When the Colts called, I told my agent, &#x27;Let&#x27;s not screw around,&#x27;&quot; said Vinatieri, in his first extensive comments regarding his departure from New England. &quot;I told him, &#x27;If Indy is interested, let&#x27;s get this done.&#x27;&quot; Vinatieri said he has no regrets about not giving the Patriots a chance to counter the offer.

With the Colts, Vinatieri had been a perfect 10-of-10 in kicks in the RCA Dome. He finished the 2006 season converting all 38 extra point attempts and 25 of 28 field goal attempts. He won AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performances in Week 1 against the New York Giants and Week 8 against the Denver Broncos. In the Divisional Round, Vinatieri kicked five field goals in the Colts&#x27; 15–6 upset of the favored Baltimore Ravens.

The Colts reached Super Bowl XLI after defeating the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. It was Vinatieri&#x27;s fifth Super Bowl appearance, and his first with the Colts. The Colts defeated the Chicago Bears 29–17. Vinatieri converted three of four field goal attempts and one of two extra point attempts, the miss when punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the extra-point attempt after the Colts&#x27; first offensive touchdown. He missed a 36-yard kick wide left at the end of the first half—the third time he had missed a kick in the Super Bowl. Super Bowl XLI was Vinatieri&#x27;s fourth Super Bowl victory. Vinatieri finished the 2006–07 postseason with 49 total points and 14 field goals, both NFL records. He is the only player to have three or more field goals in four consecutive postseason games.

====2007 season====
During the 2007 season, Vinatieri appeared in all 16 games and was 23 of 29 on field goal attempts and 49 of 51 on extra point attempts for 118 points (both missed PATs were blocked). This season marked his 12th consecutive 100+ point season. He kicked his 20th career game-winning FG in the final minute of a fourth quarter or overtime, this time with three seconds remaining against the Kansas City Chiefs on November 18, 2007. In the postseason that year, Vinatieri extended his NFL career postseason records in field goals (41), attempts (50), points (172) and consecutive games scoring (22).

====2008 season====
Vinatieri made a 47-yard game-winner with three seconds remaining against Minnesota in Week 2. He made a 52-yard FG against New England in Week 9 with 8:05 remaining for the deciding points in 18–15 victory and was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Later that month, in Week 12, Vinatieri hit a game-winner with no time remaining at San Diego. In the 2008 season, Vinatieri appeared in 16 games and converted all 43 extra point attempts and 20 of 25 field goal attempts for 103 points.

====2009 season====
In July 2009, Vinatieri had surgery on his right hip to alleviate a nagging injury, but the Colts expected that he would be ready for the season. Also, Vinatieri was placed on the injured reserve list for the rest of the season. However, Vinatieri struggled early in the season and complained of soreness in his knee. Doctors found loose cartilage in an MRI, and Vinatieri underwent arthroscopic surgery during the Colts&#x27; bye week. Vinatieri was expected to miss four to eight weeks while recovering. During the season, punter Pat McAfee assumed Vinatieri&#x27;s kickoff duties, something he would continue to do until his retirement after the 2016 season. The Colts signed former Baltimore Ravens kicker Matt Stover to replace him. There was speculation over whether the Colts could cut Vinatieri, but Colts president Bill Polian stated that Vinatieri would return when he was 100% healthy. Due to the injury, Vinatieri appeared in only six games for the Colts in 2009. He returned to the lineup and kicked a field goal but missed an extra point attempt in a Week 15 loss to the New York Jets, but then was inactive for the final game of the regular season as well as throughout the Colts&#x27; postseason run. Vinatieri did not play in Super Bowl XLIV, which the Colts lost to the New Orleans Saints. He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame First Team All-2000s Team.

====2010 season====

The 2010 season showed a return to form after Vinatieri&#x27;s injury-plagued 2009 season. Vinatieri appeared in 15 games that season. He converted all 51 extra point attempts and 26 of 28 field goal attempts. In the final game of the regular season, in which the Colts claimed the AFC South title, Vinatieri recorded his 23rd career game-winning kick in the final minute of regulation or in overtime. He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for the second time after the game. He led the league in extra points attempted and made. He finished third in total scoring.

Some other noteworthy accomplishments for Vinatieri during 2010 include:
* He became the 12th kicker in NFL history to score 1,600 points in his career.
* He became the seventh kicker in NFL history to score 500-plus points with two teams (850 with Colts; 1,156 with Patriots)
* He connected on 26 of 28 field goals (92.9 percent) this season, the best percentage among NFL kickers that season with at least 20 attempts
* On November 14 against Cincinnati, he surpassed Eddie Murray (who had 352 career FGs) for 11th-most FGs made in NFL history
* His 129 points marked the second-most of his career. It marked the 14th time he surpassed 100 points in a season
* He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week two times during 2010 (Weeks 10 and 17). It marked twelve times during his career (including 8 times with the New England Patriots)

With 53 seconds left in the Colts&#x27; Wild Card playoff game against the New York Jets, Vinatieri kicked a 50-yard field goal, his third field goal of the game, to put the Colts ahead 16–14. However, the Jets later won the game on a 32-yard field goal by Nick Folk as time expired.

====2011 season====
With Colts&#x27; quarterback Peyton Manning being out for the season due to injury, the Colts offense sputtered and had a noticeable effect on Vinatieri&#x27;s production. In the 2011 season, Vinatieri converted all 24 extra point attempts and 23 of 27 field goal attempts.

====2012 season====
In the 2012 season, Vinatieri converted all 37 extra point attempts and 26 of 33 field goal attempts.

====2013 season====
In Week 11, against the Tennessee Titans, he converted all three extra point tries and all three field goal tries in the 30–27 victory to earn AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In Week 13, against the Titans, he converted all five field goal attempts in the 22–14 victory. In Week 17, Vinatieri converted all three extra point attempts and all three field goal attempts in the 30–10 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars to earn AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In the 2013 season, Vinatieri converted 34 extra point attempts and 35 of 40 field goal attempts. In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, Vinatieri converted all six extra point attempts and two field goal attempts in the 45–44 comeback victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. Against the Patriots in the Divisional Round, Vinatieri became the first player in NFL history to convert 50 field goals in the postseason. On March 11, 2014, Vinatieri signed a two-year extension with the Colts.

====2014 season====
In Week 13 of the 2014 season, against the Washington Redskins, Vinatieri converted a career-high seven extra-point attempts in the 49–27 win. Through Week 16, Vinatieri was 28-of-28 in field goals, and was selected to his third career Pro Bowl in December. In the regular season finale against the Tennessee Titans, Vinatieri converted his first field goal but missed on his second attempt, ending his run at a perfect season. He finished the season 30-of-31 in field goal attempts, and did not miss an extra point try in 50 attempts. He was named to his third career Pro Bowl. On January 2, 2015, Vinatieri was selected by the Associated Press as the First-team All-Pro kicker, his third such selection.

On May 6, Vinatieri was ranked on the NFL Network&#x27;s NFL Top 100 Players of 2015 list as the 98th best player heading into the 2015 season, becoming the first specialist (kicker or punter) ever to be ranked in the Top 100 Players List, as well as the oldest player to be ranked at the time.

====2015 season====
In Week 4 of the 2015 season, Vinatieri became the Colts&#x27; all-time leading scorer and the first player in NFL history to score 1,000 points with two teams. In Week 8, against the Carolina Panthers, he set the NFL&#x27;s all-time record for overtime field goals made in a career with 10. In Week 11, Vinatieri converted three extra points and a game-winning field goal to give the Colts a come-from-behind win in Vinatieri&#x27;s 300th NFL game. He was named AFC Special Teams player of the Month for November. In the 2015 season, Vinatieri converted 32 of 35 extra point attempts and 25 of 27 field goal tries.

====2016 season====
On March 8, 2016, Vinatieri signed a two-year, $6 million extension with the Colts. On October 12, Vinatieri was awarded the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week Award for the 16th time in his career, establishing a new NFL record. In Week 5, against the Chicago Bears, he tied his career-high with 17 points (five field goals and two extra points) scored in the 29–23 victory. In a game against the Tennessee Titans on October 23, Vinatieri kicked his 43rd successful field goal in a row to break the NFL record set by Mike Vanderjagt. Vinatieri was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for October. His streak of consecutive successful field goals ended at 44, when he missed a 42-yard kick in the Colts&#x27; Week 11 game against the Tennessee Titans. On January 1, 2017, a missed field goal in the season&#x27;s final game against the Jacksonville Jaguars cost Vinatieri a $500,000 bonus. The bonus depended on Vinatieri finishing the 2016 campaign with a 90% or higher field goal rate. In the 2016 season, Vinatieri converted all 44 extra point attempts and 27 of 31 field goal attempts.

====2017 season====
On September 10, 2017, Vinatieri started his 22nd season in the NFL in a game against the Los Angeles Rams. In Week 5, Vinatieri went 4-for-4, hitting field goals of 23, 38, and 52 yards, followed by a 51-yard game-winner, in a 26–23 overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers, earning him AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors. He finished the 2017 season converting 22 of 24 extra point attempts and 29 of 34 field goal attempts as the Colts finished 4–12.

====2018 season: Record-setting season====
The 2018 season was one that featured several major milestones and NFL records for Vinatieri. On February 22, Vinatieri signed a one-year contract extension with the Colts through the 2018 season. In the Colts&#x27; 2018 regular season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals, Vinatieri hit a 51-yard field goal and became the oldest player to hit a field goal of 50 yards or more. In Week 2, against Washington, Vinatieri hit three extra-point attempts to score 2,501 points in his career and became only the second player in NFL history to score over 2,500 points; he also moved into fourth place all-time in extra-point attempts with 828. In Week 3, against the Philadelphia Eagles, Vinatieri connected on an extra point and 3-of-3 field goals, allowing him to tie the NFL record of 565 field goals made by Morten Andersen. In Week 4, Vinatieri hit 4-of-4 extra points and 2-of-2 field goals in a losing effort to the Houston Texans to make him the all-time leader in field goals made. He also surpassed George Blanda, moving him into fourth place all-time in career games played with 341. On October 4, 2018, Vinatieri kicked a 54-yard field goal to break his own record of the oldest player to hit a 50+ yard field goal. He also surpassed Gary Anderson, moving him into second place all-time in field goal attempts with 674. In Week 6, against the New York Jets, Vinatieri scored 10 points, hitting 2-for-2 in field goals and 4-for-4 in extra points, surpassing Anderson and moving into third place all-time in extra-point attempts. In Week 8, against the Oakland Raiders, Vinatieri scored 10 points and became the all-time NFL leader in points scored with 2,550. He earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his game against the Raiders. In Week 14, in a win over the Texans, Vinatieri made 3-for-3 extra points to move into second place all-time with 860 and he also connected on a 54-yard field goal to break his own record of oldest player to connect on a 50+ yard field goal. He also became the fourth player in NFL history to play in 350 games. In a Week 17 game against the Tennessee Titans, two days after his 46th birthday, Vinatieri broke his own record with a 53-yard field goal to become the oldest player to kick a 50+ yard field goal and moved into second place for most extra point attempts with 852. He also became the fourth oldest player to play in a game. He finished the 2018 season converting 44 of 47 extra point attempts and 23 of 27 field goal attempts.

====2019 season====

On September 8, 2019, Vinatieri started his 24th season in the NFL in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers. He had one of the worst games of his career, as he went 1–3 on field-goal attempts and 1–2 on extra points. In that game he became the third-oldest player in NFL history to play in a game and surpassed Gary Anderson for the second-most games played in NFL history. In the following game against the Tennessee Titans, he missed two more extra points. In Week 3 against the Atlanta Falcons, Vinatieri rebounded and went a perfect 3 for 3 on extra points and a perfect 2 for 2 on field goals, including a 49 yarder which hit the lower crossbar and barely went over. The 49-yarder also marked the longest field goal ever made by someone his age in an NFL game. In Week 5, Vinatieri made all four field-goal attempts and an extra point in a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. With his 701st field goal attempt, he became only the second player to attempt 700 or more field goals, joining Morten Andersen. In Week 8 against the Denver Broncos, Vinatieri made three field goals, two of which were from 50+ yards away, one of which was 55 yards, thus making him the oldest player to make two or more from that distance in a single game, as well as making him the oldest player to kick a field goal of 55 yards or more, in the 15–13 win. He was named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance despite having missed a field goal and an extra point within the game. In the following week&#x27;s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Vinatieri missed a potential game-winning field goal late in the fourth quarter in the 26–24 loss; this unsuccessful field goal attempt tied him with Andersen for the most field goal attempts in a career. In the next game, Vinatieri became the all-time leader in field goal attempts in a career. On December 9, 2019, the Colts placed Vinatieri on injured reserve after he underwent season-ending knee surgery. Vinatieri finished the year with career-lows in field goal and extra point completion percentage at 68% and 78.6%, respectively. He finished 17 of 25 on field goal attempts and 22 of 28 on extra point attempts.

===Retirement===
On May 26, 2021, Vinatieri announced his retirement from the NFL after 24 seasons on the daily radio show of former Colts teammate and punter Pat McAfee. He retired as the NFL&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, as well as the last active player to have played in the 1990s, and the last to play before Tom Brady. His 365 games were the second most by an NFL player all-time, behind Morten Andersen&#x27;s 382.

==Personal life==
Vinatieri grew up in the Black Hills of western South Dakota. His great-great-grandfather was Felix Vinatieri, an Italian immigrant who served as Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s bandmaster. Vinatieri stated that Custer told Felix Vinatieri to head back to camp instead of going ahead with the regiment to the Battle of the Little Bighorn, a direction that saved his life. Vinatieri is also a third cousin to daredevil Evel Knievel and second cousin to scientist and author Tim Foecke (their mothers are first cousins).

Vinatieri&#x27;s sister is South Dakota politician Christine Erickson. Vinatieri&#x27;s nephew, Chase, followed in his footsteps as a kicker at South Dakota State.

Vinatieri has an interest in motor racing and co-owns Miller Vinatieri Motorsports with former racing driver Jack Miller, which competes in multiple series in the Road to Indy.

Vinatieri has three kids with his wife, Valarie. One of his son&#x27;s, A. J., is a kicker and punter at University of Louisville.

Vinatieri once starred in a television commercial for the Snickers candy bar with the tagline, &quot;Split the Uprights with Adam Nougatieri.&quot;

Vinatieri starred in a FanDuel commercial alongside tight end Rob Gronkowski, in which he coached Gronkowski on how to effectively kick a field goal.

<doc id="440004" wikidata="Q6504469" url="?curid=440004" title="Lawrence Pazder">
<text>Lawrence Pazder (April 30, 1936 – March 5, 2004) was a Canadian psychiatrist and author. Pazder wrote the discredited biography, &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, published in 1980, with his patient (and eventual wife) Michelle Smith, which claimed to detail satanic ritual abuse.

==Background==
Pazder was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on April 30, 1936, and completed his undergraduate medical training at the University of Alberta in 1961. He received a diploma in tropical medicine from the University of Liverpool in 1962, practicing medicine in Nigeria from 1962 to 1964. Pazder returned to Canada in 1964 and completed his psychiatric training at McGill University in 1968. During his professional career, Pazder worked at two Victoria, British Columbia hospitals in addition to his private psychiatric practice. Pazder saw patients at his private psychiatric practice in Victoria until his sudden and unexpected death of heart failure in March 2004.

Pazder considered himself to be a devout Catholic. As part of his church activities Pazder founded the Anawim Companions Society in Victoria to provide a day home for people in need as a result of poverty. Pazder also had an interest in African religions and religious ceremonies.

Pazder and his first wife Marylyn had four children together and were married for many years, until he developed a relationship with his patient Michelle Smith. Court documents filed in the divorce proceedings indicated that between March 1977 and June 1979 Pazder disappeared with Smith (co-author of &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;) for lengthy periods of time. In 1979 after a rejected attempt at annulment, Pazder divorced his first wife and later married his former patient and co-author, Smith.

Pazder died in his home of heart failure on March 4, 2004.

==&quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; and satanic ritual abuse==

In 1973 Pazder first started treating a woman named Michelle Smith in his private psychiatric practice in Victoria. In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided she felt that she had something important to tell him, but could not remember what it was. Soon thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith allegedly screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old. The book claims that Pazder used hypnosis on Smith to recover memories of alleged satanic ritual abuse, that would have occurred during 1954 and 1955 when Smith was five years old, at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, whom Smith alleges were members of a Satanic cult in Victoria. As Pazder believed he was on the verge of uncovering a vast satanic conspiracy, he eventually would spend many hours at a time treating Smith during a 14-month period. So convinced of the problem of satanic ritual abuse, Pazder and Smith travelled to the Vatican in 1978 to alert the Catholic church about the previously unknown dangers to children posed by Satanic cults worldwide. Pazder and Smith co-authored &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; about the chronicles of the therapy sessions and purported recovered memories, using scientifically discredited methods. &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; was the first published survivor account of alleged satanic ritual abuse and was a publishing success, earning Pazder and Smith a $100,000 hard-cover advance and $242,000 for paperback rights.

After the publication of &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, Pazder was considered to be an expert for the topic of satanic ritual abuse. With the sudden development of satanic ritual abuse cases during the 1980s (likely due to the publication of &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;), Pazder&#x27;s supposed expertise was requested. In 1984, Pazder acted as a consultant in the McMartin preschool trial. Pazder also appeared on the first major news report on Satanism (broadcast on May 16, 1985), by ABC&#x27;s television series &quot;20/20&quot;. In the report titled &quot;The Devil Worshippers&quot;, Pazder discussed the clues that he felt indicated satanic practices. Pazder also participated in the first national seminar at which law enforcement were introduced to the satanic ritual abuse of children (in Fort Collins, Colorado, on September 9–12, 1986). Subsequently, Pazder was part of the CCIN (Cult Crime Impact Network) and lectured to police agencies about satanic ritual abuse during the late 1980s along with other speakers such as Mike Warnke. By 1987 Pazder reported that he was spending a third of his time consulting on satanic ritual abuse cases.

Pazder is credited with coining the term &#x27;ritual abuse&#x27; to describe the type abuse that Smith alleged. At a professional conference in Richmond, Virginia in 1987, Pazder defined ritual abuse of children as &quot;repeated physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual assaults combined with a systematic use of symbols and secret ceremonies designed to turn a child against itself, family, society and God.&quot; Pazder alleged that &quot;the sexual assault has ritualistic meaning and is not for sexual gratification.&quot; Pazder claimed that &quot;The pure group of &#x27;orthodox satanists&#x27; is never seen or identified in public, yet it is this group of invisible satanists who plant the seeds and encourage all the more visible satanic groups&quot;.

Further investigations into the allegations made in &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; found no evidence to support them and satanic ritual abuse is considered to be a moral panic.

<doc id="440006" wikidata="Q706501" url="?curid=440006" title="Führerprinzip">
<text>The  (, &quot;Leader Principle&quot;) was the basis of executive authority in the government of Nazi Germany. It placed the Führer&#x27;s word above all written law, and meant that government policies, decisions, and officials all served to realize his will. In practice, the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; gave Adolf Hitler supreme power over the ideology and policies of his political party; this form of personal dictatorship was a basic characteristic of Nazism. The state itself received &quot;political authority&quot; from Hitler, and the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; stipulated that only what the Führer &quot;commands, allows, or does not allow is our conscience,&quot; with party leaders pledging &quot;eternal allegiance to Adolf Hitler.&quot;

According to Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, the Nazi German political system meant &quot;unconditional authority downwards, and responsibility upwards.&quot; At each level of the pyramidal power structure the sub-leader, or &quot;Unterführer&quot;, was subordinate to the superior leader, and responsible to him for all successes and failures. &quot;As early as July 1921,&quot; Hitler proclaimed the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; as the &quot;law of the Nazi Party,&quot; and in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; he said the principle would govern the new Reich. At the Bamberg Conference on 14 February 1926, Hitler invoked the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; to assert his power, and affirmed his total authority over Nazi administrators at the party membership meeting in Munich on 2 August 1928.

The Nazi government implemented the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; throughout German civil society. Business organizations and civil institutions were thus led by an appointed leader, rather than managed by an elected committee of professional experts. This included the schools, both public and private, the sports associations, and the factories. Beginning in 1934, the German armed forces swore a &quot;Führer Oath&quot; to Hitler personally, not the German constitution. As a common theme of Nazi propaganda, the &quot;Leader Principle&quot; compelled obedience to the supreme leader who—by personal command—could override the rule of law as exercised by elected parliaments, appointed committees, and bureaucracies. The German cultural reverence for national leaders such as King Frederick the Great (r. 1740–1786) and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (r. 1871–1890), and the historic example of the Nordic saga, were also appropriated to support the idea. The ultranationalist &quot;Leader Principle&quot; vested &quot;complete and all-embracing&quot; authority in the &quot;myth person&quot; of Hitler who, as Rudolf Hess declared in 1934, &quot;was always right and will always be right.&quot;

==Ideology==
The political science term &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; was coined by Hermann von Keyserling, an Estonian philosopher of German descent. Ideologically, the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; considers organizations to be a hierarchy of leaders, wherein each leader (&quot;Führer&quot;) has absolute responsibility in, and for, his own area of authority, is owed absolute obedience from subordinates, and answers to his superior officers; the subordinate&#x27;s obedience also includes personal loyalty to the leader. In both theory and practice, the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; made Adolf Hitler supreme leader of the German nation.
===The total state===
By presenting Hitler as the incarnation of authority—a saviour-politician who personally dictates the law—the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; functioned as a color of law legalism that conferred executive, judicial, and legislative powers of government on the person of Hitler as &quot;Führer und Reichskanzler&quot;, the combined leader and chancellor of Germany. For example, following the 1934 Night of the Long Knives, Hitler justified his violent political purge of Ernst Röhm and the Strasserite faction of the Nazi Party as a matter of German national security, and stated: “In this hour, I was responsible for the fate of the German nation and was therefore the supreme judge of the German people!”

As a proponent of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;, the German legal theorist Carl Schmitt defended the political purges and the felony crimes of the Nazis individually, and the Nazi Party collectively, because the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; stipulated that the Führer&#x27;s word supersedes any contradictory law. In the book &quot;The Legal Basis of the Total State&quot; (1933), Schmitt said the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; was the ideological and political foundation of the Nazi German total state, writing: 

The strength of the National Socialist State lies in the fact that it is [ruled] from top to bottom and in every atom of its existence ruled and permeated with the concept of leadership [&quot;Führertum&quot;]. This principle [of leadership], which made the movement strong, must be carried through systematically, both in the administration of the State and in the various spheres of self-government, naturally taking into account the [ideologic] modifications required by the particular area in question. But it would not be permissible for any important area of public life to operate independently from the &quot;Führer&quot; concept.

===Political cohesion===
For the Nazi Party, the &quot;Leader Principle&quot; was considered integral to political cohesion. In July 1921, to affirm personal control of the Nazi Party, Hitler confronted Anton Drexler—the original founder of the Nazi Party—to thwart Drexler&#x27;s proposal to unite the Nazi Party with the larger German Socialist Party. Fervently opposed to this idea, Hitler angrily left the Nazi Party on 11 July 1921. However, understanding that the absence of Hitler would destroy the party&#x27;s credibility, party committee members accepted Hitler&#x27;s demand to replace Drexler as party chairman, and Hitler rejoined.

The increased number of party members split into two ideological factions; the northern faction of the Nazi Party championed the Third position politics of Strasserism (revolutionary nationalism and economic antisemitism), and was led by Otto Strasser and Gregor Strasser; the southern faction of the party followed Hitler&#x27;s brand of Nazism, and was led by Hitler himself. The two factions greatly disagreed about the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;, and whether or not it was an essential principle for the party. On 14 February 1926, at the Bamberg Conference, Hitler defeated all factional opposition and established the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; as the managing principle of the Nazi Party.

===Leader Principle in action===

In 1934, Hitler imposed the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; on the government and civil society of Weimar Germany in order to create the Nazi state. While the fascist government did not require the German business community to adopt Nazi techniques of administration, it did mandate that businesses rename their management hierarchies using the politically correct language of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; ideology.

Hermann Göring said to British ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson that, “When a decision has to be taken, none of us counts more than the stones on which we are standing. It is the Führer, alone, who decides”. Following the adoption of the &quot;Führer Oath&quot; by the German armed forces in 1934, Hitler wrote a public letter to Defense Minister Werner von Blomberg, saying, &quot;Just as the officers and soldiers of the Wehrmacht bind themselves to the new state in my person, so shall I always regard it as my highest duty to defend the existence and inviolability of the Wehrmacht in fulfillment of the testament of the late field marshal and, faithful to my own will, to anchor the army in the nation as the sole bearer of arms.&quot;

==Propaganda==
Nazi propaganda films promoted the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; as a basis for the organization of the civil society of Germany. In the 1933 film , the hero rescues refugee Volga Germans from Communist persecution by a leader who requires unquestioning obedience. altered the source material to depict the hero, Clausen, as the stalwart leader of his munitions company, who, when faced with the machinations of his children, decides to disown them and bestows the company to the state, confident that there will arise a factory worker who is a true leader of men capable of continuing Clausen&#x27;s work. In the 1941 film &quot;Carl Peters&quot; the protagonist is a decisive man of action who fights and defeats the African natives to establish German colonies in Africa, but Peters is thwarted by a parliament who does not understand that German society needs the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;.

At school, adolescent boys were taught Nordic sagas as the literary illustration of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; possessed by the German heroes Frederick the Great and Otto von Bismarck.

This was combined with the glorification of the one, central , Adolf Hitler. During the Night of the Long Knives, it was claimed that his decisive action saved Germany, though it meant (in Goebbels&#x27;s description) suffering &quot;tragic loneliness&quot; from being a Siegfried forced to shed blood to preserve Germany. In one speech Robert Ley explicitly proclaimed &quot;The is always right.&quot; Booklets given out for the Winter Relief donations included &quot;The Führer Makes History&quot;, a collection of Hitler photographs, and &quot;The Führer’s Battle in the East&quot; Films such as and &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; glorified him.

==War crime defense==
In the aftermath of the Second World War (1937–1945), at the Allied war-crime Nuremberg Trials (1945–1946) of captured Nazi leaders in Germany, and at the Eichmann Trial (1961) in Israel, the criminal defence arguments presented the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; as a concept of jurisprudence that voided the military command responsibility of the accused war criminals, because they were military officers following superior orders.

In the book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; (1963), Hannah Arendt said that, aside from a personal desire to improve his career as an administrator, Eichmann did not manifest antisemitism or any psychological abnormality. That Eichmann personified &quot;the banality of evil&quot; given the commonplace personality Eichmann displayed at trial, which communicated neither feelings of guilt nor feelings of hatred whilst he denied personal responsibility for his war crimes. In his defense, Eichmann said he was &quot;doing his job&quot;, and that he always tried to act in accordance with the categorical imperative proposed in the deontological moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant.

<doc id="440014" wikidata="Q3634161" url="?curid=440014" title="Organ culture">
<text>Organ culture is the cultivation of either whole organs or parts of organs in vitro. It is a development from tissue culture methods of research, as the use of the actual &quot;in vitro&quot; organ itself allows for more accurate modelling of the functions of an organ in various states and conditions. 

A key objective of organ culture is to maintain the architecture of the tissue and direct it towards normal development. In this technique, it is essential that the tissue is never disrupted or damaged. It thus requires careful handling. The media used for a growing organ culture are generally the same as those used for tissue culture. The techniques for organ culture can be classified into (i) those employing a solid medium and (ii) those employing liquid medium.

Organ culture technology has contributed to advances in embryology, inflammation, cancer, and stem cell biology research.

==Current progress==
In April 2006, scientists reported a successful trial of seven bladders grown in-vitro and given to humans. A bladder has been cultured by Anthony Atala of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. A jawbone has been cultured at Columbia University, a lung has been cultured at Yale. A beating rat heart has been cultured by Doris Taylor at the University of Minnesota. An artificial kidney has been cultured by H. David Humes at the University of Michigan.

Silk cut from silkworm cocoons has been successfully used as growth scaffolding for heart tissue production. Heart tissue does not regenerate if damaged, so producing replacement patches is of great interest. The experiment used rat heart cells and produced functional heart tissue. In order to further test applications to humans as a cure, a way to transform human stem cells into heart tissue would have to be found.

In 2015, Harald Ott was able to grow a rat forelimb. He now works at Ott Lab which focuses on the creation of bioartificial hearts, lungs, tracheas and kidneys.

In 2016, another test was done in which human cells were used to assemble intricately structured hearts. The hearts ultimately proved immature but proved we were yet one step further to making a heart from stem cells.

In January 2017, scientists from Salk Institute for Biological Studies managed to create a pig embryo that had part of its DNA, critical for the growth of organs, edited out. They then introduced human stem cells inside the pig embryo to have the human DNA fill in the gaps.

In March 2022, research was published that demonstrated the tentative success of a corneal implant called BPCDX that was shown to have significant tissue attachment and host cell migration once implanted. 

==Methodology==
=== In vitro culture===
Embryonic organ culture is an easier alternative to normal organ culture derived from adult animals. The following are four techniques employed for embryonic organ culture.

====Plasma clot method====
The following are general steps in organ culture on plasma clots.

#Prepare a plasma clot by mixing 15 drops of plasma with five drops of embryo extract in a watch glass.
#Place a watch glass on a pad of cotton wool in a petri dish; cotton wool is kept moist to prevent excessive evaporation from the dish.
#Place a small, carefully dissected piece of tissue on top of the plasma clots in watch glass.

The technique has now been modified, and a raft of lens paper or rayon net is used on which the tissue is placed. Transfer of the tissue can then be achieved by raft easily. Excessive fluid is removed and the net with the tissue placed again on the fresh pool of medium.

====Agar gel method====
Media solidified with agar are also used for organ culture and these media consist of 7 parts 1% agar in BSS, 3 parts chick embryo extract and 3 parts of horse serum. Defined media with or without serum are also used with agar. The medium with agar provides the mechanical support for organ culture. It does not liquefy. Embryonic organs generally grow well on agar, but adult organ culture will not survive on this medium.

The culture of adult organs or parts from adult animals is more difficult due to their greater requirement of oxygen. A variety of adult organs (e.g. the liver) have been cultured using special media with special apparatus (Towell&#x27;s II culture chamber). Since serum was found to be toxic, serum-free media were used, and the special apparatus permitted the use of 95% oxygen.

====Raft Methods====
In this approach the explant is placed onto a raft of lens paper or rayon acetate, which is floated on serum in a watch glass. Rayon acetate rafts are made to float on the serum by treating their 4 corners with silicone.

Similarly, floatability of lens paper is enhanced by treating it with silicone. On each raft, 4 or more explants are usually placed.

In a combination of raft and clot techniques, the explants are first placed on a suitable raft, which is then kept on a plasma clot. This modification makes media changes easy, and prevents the sinking of explants into liquefied plasma.

====Grid Method====
Initially devised by Trowell in 1954, the grid method utilizes 25 mm x 25 mm pieces of a suitable wire mesh or perforated stainless steel sheet whose edges are bent to form 4 legs of about 4 mm height.

Skeletal tissues are generally placed directly on the grid but softer tissues like glands or skin are first placed on rafts, which are then kept on the grids.

The grids themselves are placed in a culture chamber filled with fluid medium up to the grid; the chamber is supplied with a mixture of O2 and CO2 to meet the high O2 requirements of adult mammalian organs. A modification of the original grid method is widely used to study the growth and differentiation of adult and embryonic tissues.

==Uses==
Cultured organs can be an alternative for organs from other (living or deceased) people.
This is useful as the availability of transplantable organs (derived from other people) is declining in developed countries.
Another advantage is that cultured organs, created using the patients own stem cell, allows for organ transplants where the patient would no longer require immunosuppressive drugs.

==Limitations==
* Results from in vitro organ cultures are often not comparable to those from in vivo studies (e.g. studies on drug action) since the drugs are metabolized in vivo but not in vitro.

<text>Aisha Tyler (born September 18, 1970) is an American actress and talk show host. She is known for playing Andrea Marino in the first season of &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, Dr. Tara Lewis in &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; since 2015, Mother Nature in the final two &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; films, and voicing Lana Kane in &quot;Archer&quot;. She also had recurring roles on &quot;&quot;, &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, and &quot;Friends&quot;.

She co-hosted seasons two through seven of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Talk&quot;, for which she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host. Since 2013, she has hosted &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;. She also hosted Ubisoft&#x27;s E3 press conferences and has lent her voice to the video games &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gears of War 3&quot;, and &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;.

==Early life==
Tyler, who is of African American heritage, was born on September 18, 1970, in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Robin Gregory, a teacher, and James Tyler, a photographer. The family spent one year in Ethiopia and later spent time living in an ashram in Oakland, California. Her parents separated when she was ten years old, after which her father raised her. Her maternal great-grandfather was Thomas Montgomery Gregory, a dramatist and educator, and her great-great-grandfather was Howard University professor James Monroe Gregory.

She pursued an early interest in comedy at McAteer High School in San Francisco, which had a special program called School of the Arts, now named Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts. Tyler attended high school with Sam Rockwell and Margaret Cho. She had a crush on Rockwell and followed him into acting class one day, leading to her interest in improv and sketch.

Tyler graduated from Dartmouth College in 1992. She was a member of The Tabard, a co-ed fraternity. At Dartmouth, she co-founded and sang in the Dartmouth Rockapellas, an all-female a cappella group devoted to spreading social awareness through song.

After briefly working for a San Francisco advertising firm, she toured the country pursuing a comedy career then moved to Los Angeles in 1996.

==Career==
Tyler&#x27;s career in television took off in 2001 with jobs as the host of &quot;Talk Soup&quot; and the reality-dating series &quot;The 5th Wheel&quot;, although &quot;Talk Soup&quot; was canceled the following year and Tyler left &quot;The 5th Wheel&quot; in 2002 to pursue other interests. Tyler has devoted a significant amount of her time to independent projects, including a role in the play &quot;Moose Mating&quot;, for which she received an NAACP Image Award. She also wrote, directed, and starred in the independent short film &quot;The Whipper&quot;. Moving into acting, Tyler featured in &quot;Friends&quot; as Dr. Charlie Wheeler where she was Joey&#x27;s and then Ross&#x27;s girlfriend in the ninth and tenth seasons. She followed this up with guest spots on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, as well as balancing season-long recurring roles on both &quot;&quot; and &quot;24&quot; during the 2004–2005 television season. She also filmed her own talk show pilot for ABC and a sitcom pilot for CBS, neither of which was picked up. She has guest-starred on &quot;MADtv&quot;.

Following her regular role on the CBS series &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; during its first season, Tyler appeared in several films, including &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot;, &quot;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause&quot;, &quot;.45&quot;, the comedy &quot;Balls of Fury&quot; and the Lifetime drama film &quot;For One Night&quot; alongside Raven-Symoné. In 2007, she filmed the thriller &quot;Death Sentence&quot; and the crime drama &quot;Black Water Transit&quot;. She also continues to appear on television, with appearances on &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, and as a guest film critic on several episodes of &quot;At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, filling in for the absent Roger Ebert while he recuperated from surgery.
Tyler has moved into print media as a regular contributor to &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazines. Her first book, &quot;Swerve: A Guide to the Sweet Life for Postmodern Girls&quot;, was released in January 2004. Tyler plays on the &quot;World Poker Tour&quot; in the Hollywood Home games for the Futures Without Violence charity. She also made a guest appearance on Kanye West&#x27;s single &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, which featured Twista and Jamie Foxx. Philanthropy and charity work are very important to Tyler, and she regularly does volunteer work for the American Red Cross, The Trust for Public Land, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the International Rescue Committee.

Tyler appeared in a nude pictorial, along with other celebrities, in the May 2006 issue of &quot;Allure&quot;. The annual Nude Issue raises money to combat skin cancer.

In May 2009, it was announced that ABC had given Tyler her own talk show pilot, &quot;The Aisha Tyler Show&quot;. In early May 2010, she presented the &quot;Welcome to the Beta&quot; video for &quot;&quot;. She also voiced a minor character in the game.

In 2009, she began her starring role voicing Lana Kane in the FX series &quot;Archer&quot;, which premiered on January 14, 2010 and ran for a total of 14 seasons, ending in 2023. In August 2010, Tyler began appearing in a recurring guest spot on &quot;The Stephanie Miller Show&quot;. The segment is named &quot;Tuesdays With Tyler&quot;. Tyler appears either in-studio or via phone when she is not otherwise committed to one of her acting roles. While Hal Sparks was out of the country, Tyler filled in as the third member of the Stephanie Miller Sexy Liberal Comedy Tour on three shows in August 2011.

Also in 2009, Tyler performed her stand-up comedy routine live at the Fillmore Theatre.

On July 26, 2011, Tyler premiered her own weekly podcast, &quot;Girl on Guy&quot;, where she interviews her favorite celebrity friends and discusses topics guys love. The show launched as the No. 4 comedy podcast on iTunes. The first weekly installment of &quot;Girl on Guy&quot; featured guest H. Jon Benjamin (her costar on &quot;Archer&quot;); the second featured the host of Current TV&#x27;s former show &quot;InfoMania&quot;, Brett Erlich, on August 1, 2011; and the third featured &quot;Archer&quot; creator Adam Reed on August 9, 2011. She hosted the show until 2017.

In October 2011, it was announced that Tyler would join the cast of &quot;The Talk&quot; as a permanent co-host, replacing Holly Robinson Peete. Her first full week as a co-host was from October 24 through October 28, 2011. Tyler is known for being expressive and outspoken on The Talk, especially about African American culture and stereotypes, LGBT rights, and women&#x27;s rights. Tyler presented Ubisoft&#x27;s press conference at E3 2012 in June, which received some backlash from fans who didn&#x27;t believe Tyler was a gamer. This caused Tyler to respond with a poem about how she has been playing video games &quot;since you were a twinge in the left side of your daddy&#x27;s underoos.&quot; She returned to host the publisher&#x27;s press conference the following year. Tyler&#x27;s second book, &quot;Self-Inflicted Wounds: Heartwarming Tales of Epic Humiliation&quot;, debuted in July 2013, later becoming a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller; it was inspired by questions asked of guests on &quot;Girl on Guy&quot;.

In March 2013, Tyler was confirmed to be the new host of the American version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;. She also appears briefly as herself in the video game &quot;Watch Dogs&quot; and is featured in the music video for the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic song &quot;Tacky&quot;. Tyler was also the original voice for the character Daisy Fitzroy in the 2013 video game &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, but her recordings were not used and the role went to Kimberly Brooks. She was nominated for Personality of 2014 in Golden Joystick Award 2014.

In June 2015, it was announced that Tyler landed a recurring role on the eleventh season of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; as Dr. Tara Lewis. Although she served as a temporary replacement for Jennifer Love Hewitt, who was on maternity leave, her status was elevated to a main cast member in season 12.

In 2016, Tyler started a Kickstarter campaign to fund her directorial feature film debut, &quot;Axis&quot;. The film was shot over seven days in May 2016. &quot;Axis&quot; premiered at the 2017 Sarasota Film Festival and was an official selection at seven other major US festivals, winning Outstanding Achievement at the Newport Beach Film Festival. &quot;Axis&quot; was released via video-on-demand on April 10, 2018.

On the June 15, 2017, episode of &quot;The Talk&quot;, Tyler announced that she would be leaving the show at the end of the seventh season due to her busy schedule with three other television shows and directing films. She said she would return as a guest host and promote her various projects.

In 2023, she co-starred in the hit Apple TV+ limited series &quot;The Last Thing He Told Me,&quot; opposite Jennifer Garner.

== Personal life ==
Tyler married attorney Jeff Tietjens in 1992 or 1994 (sources differ). The pair separated in January 2015 and Tietjens filed for divorce in April 2016. The divorce was finalized in May 2017.

<doc id="440018" wikidata="Q374282" url="?curid=440018" title="Duck typing">
<text>In computer programming, duck typing is an application of the duck test—&quot;If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck&quot;—to determine whether an object can be used for a particular purpose. With nominative typing, an object is of a given type if it is declared as such (or if a type&#x27;s association with the object is inferred through mechanisms such as object inheritance). With duck typing, an object is of a given type if it has all methods and properties required by that type. Duck typing may be viewed as a usage-based structural equivalence between a given object and the requirements of a type.

==Examples==
This simple example in Python 3 demonstrates how any object may be used in any context until it is used in a way that it does not support.
class Duck:
 def swim(self):
 print(&quot;Duck swimming&quot;)

 def fly(self):
 print(&quot;Duck flying&quot;)

class Whale:
 def swim(self):
 print(&quot;Whale swimming&quot;)

for animal in [Duck(), Whale()]:
 animal.swim()
 animal.fly()
Output:

Duck swimming
Duck flying
Whale swimming
AttributeError: &#x27;Whale&#x27; object has no attribute &#x27;fly&#x27;

If it can be assumed that anything that can swim is a duck because ducks can swim, a whale could be considered a duck; however, if it is also assumed that a duck must be capable of flying, the whale will not be considered a duck.

==In statically typed languages==
In some statically typed languages such as Boo and D, class type checking can be specified to occur at runtime rather than at compile time.

==Comparison with other type systems==

===Structural type systems===

Duck typing is similar to, but distinct from, structural typing. Structural typing is a static typing system that determines type compatibility and equivalence by a type&#x27;s structure, whereas duck typing is dynamic and determines type compatibility by only that part of a type&#x27;s structure that is accessed during runtime.

The TypeScript, Elm and Python languages support structural typing to varying degrees.

===Protocols and interfaces===

Protocols and interfaces provide a way to explicitly declare that some methods, operators or behaviors must be defined. If a third-party library implements a class that cannot be modified, a client cannot use an instance of it with an interface unknown to that library even if the class satisfies the interface requirements. A common solution to this problem is the adapter pattern. In contrast, with duck typing, the object would be accepted directly without the need for an adapter.

===Templates or generic types===

Template (also called generic) functions or methods apply the duck test in a static typing context; this brings all of the advantages and disadvantages of static versus dynamic type checking. Duck typing can also be more flexible in that only the methods actually called at runtime must be implemented, while templates require implementations of all methods that cannot be proven unreachable at compile time.

In languages such as Java, Scala and Objective-C, reflection may be employed to inspect whether objects implement methods or add necessary methods at runtime. For example, Java&#x27;s MethodHandle API can be used in this manner.

<text>Joseph Eric Thornton (born July 2, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He played for the Boston Bruins, San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs and Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected first overall by the Bruins in the 1997 NHL entry draft and went on to play seven seasons with the club, three as its captain. During the 2005–06 season, he was traded to the Sharks. Splitting the campaign between the two teams, he received the Art Ross and Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading point-scorer and most valuable player, respectively, becoming the only player in NHL history to win either award in a season played for multiple teams. Thornton went on to play another 14 seasons with the Sharks, including four seasons as team captain and a run to the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals. Thornton was the last active NHL player and the last big 4 North American sports player to have played in the 1990s.

Thornton&#x27;s on-ice vision, strength on the puck, deft passing ability and power forward style of play led to him becoming one of the league&#x27;s premier centres and . He is widely regarded as one of the best passers of all time, and he is one of only 14 players with 1,000 NHL assists. His nickname &quot;Jumbo Joe&quot; is a nod to his large stature and to Jumbo the elephant, who died in St. Thomas, Ontario, where Thornton was raised.

==Playing career==

===Amateur career===
Thornton grew up playing minor hockey in his hometown of St. Thomas, Ontario, for the St. Thomas Travellers. He played &quot;AA&quot; hockey for the Travelers minors and in peewee won an Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA) championship in 1992–93. His Bantam year was the first for the newly created &quot;AAA&quot; Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs organization, and Thornton joined the &quot;AAA&quot; Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs of the Minor Hockey Alliance of Ontario for the 1993–94 season. The creation of this organization led to the St. Thomas Minor Hockey Association to compete at the &quot;A&quot; level. During his bantam year, he appeared in six games for the Junior B St. Thomas Stars of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), scoring eight points in six games as a 14-year-old. The following season, Thornton joined the Stars full-time and reeled off 104 points over 50 games as a 15-year-old, and was subsequently drafted second overall in the 1995 OHL draft to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds behind Daniel Tkaczuk, who was selected by the Barrie Colts.

Beginning in 1995–96, Thornton began a two-year career in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Greyhounds. He posted a 76-point season in his first year, earning both OHL and CHL Rookie of the Year honours. The following season, Thornton improved to 41 goals and 122 points, second overall in League scoring behind Marc Savard of the Oshawa Generals, and was named to the OHL second All-Star team.

===Boston Bruins (1997–2005)===
After his second OHL season, Thornton was selected first overall in the 1997 NHL entry draft by the Boston Bruins. Thornton suffered a fractured arm in the Bruins&#x27; pre-season but made their roster for the 1997–98 campaign. He scored his first career NHL goal on December 3, 1997, in a 3–0 win against the Philadelphia Flyers. Bruins head coach Pat Burns was measured in his deployment of Thornton, using him almost exclusively on the fourth line and making him a regular healthy scratch. Averaging eight minutes and five seconds of ice time per game over the course of the season, he registered three goals and seven points in 55 games as a rookie. In the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs, Thornton went scoreless in six games.

In 1998–99, Thornton saw significantly more ice time, averaging 15 minutes and 20 seconds per game, and improved to 41 points in 81 games, as well as a 9-point effort in 11 playoff games.

Thornton continued to build into a key player in the Bruins&#x27; line-up, increasing his points total in each of the following two campaigns. Prior to the 2002–03 season, he was named team captain, succeeding Jason Allison, who was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 2001; the captaincy position was vacant for a full season after Allison&#x27;s departure. In his first season as team captain, Thornton recorded 68 points over 66 games. The following year, he notched his first career 100-point season with 36 goals, a career-high, and 65 assists. He ranked third in NHL point-scoring, behind Peter Forsberg of the Colorado Avalanche and Markus Näslund from the Vancouver Canucks.

Thornton&#x27;s production declined to 73 points in 77 games in the 2003–04 campaign. He suffered a fractured right cheekbone in a fight with New York Rangers centre Eric Lindros during a game on January 19, 2004. The two power forwards fought after Lindros cross-checked Thornton in the head. The injury required surgery, keeping him out of the line-up for three games. The 2003–04 campaign also saw a drop in Thornton&#x27;s goal-scoring production that has never since rebounded; his last 30-goal season came during the 2002–03 season.

During the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, Thornton went abroad to play for HC Davos of the Swiss National League A (NLA). He played on a line with fellow NHL players Rick Nash and Niklas Hagman, helping HC Davos to win the League championship and the Spengler Cup. Nash and Thornton have subsequently kept in contact with HC Davos and their longtime coach Arno del Curto; Thornton returned to train with the club for up to a month each summer.

Ahead of the NHL resumption in 2005–06, Thornton became a restricted free agent in summer 2005. Negotiations on a new contract were strained: Thornton was reportedly unhappy with the direction of the Bruins franchise, and upset with criticism of his play in the Bruins&#x27; early playoff exit in 2004. Boston&#x27;s front office was apparently unhappy with Thornton&#x27;s leadership style and for not raising his level of play during the playoffs. Nevertheless, Thornton re-signed with Boston on August 11, 2005, to a three-year, $20 million contract.

Thornton began the 2005–06 season strongly (33 points in 24 games), making him the team&#x27;s leading scorer by a substantial margin, but the Bruins were struggling in the standings. 

===San Jose Sharks (2005–2020)===
On November 30, 2005, Thornton was traded to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forwards Marco Sturm, Wayne Primeau and defenceman Brad Stuart. Mike O&#x27;Connell, the Bruins general manager who traded Thornton, stated in June 2011 that he &quot;would still make the trade&quot;, and that it was &quot;satisfying&quot; that Boston had won a Stanley Cup before Thornton&#x27;s new team had. Despite O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s stance, the trade is widely considered to be a lopsided deal in favor of the Sharks. Upon arriving in San Jose, Thornton improved the Sharks&#x27; fortunes and found instant chemistry with winger Jonathan Cheechoo. During the absence of usual alternate captain Alyn McCauley from the San Jose line-up, Thornton donned the &quot;A&quot; for the first time as a Shark in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on March 30, 2006, and wore the &quot;A&quot; whenever McCauley was out of the line-up for the remainder of the season. Tallying 92 points in 58 games with the Sharks after the trade, Thornton finished the season with 29 goals, a league-leading 96 assists and 125 points total to earn the Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s top scorer. He became the first player to win the award while splitting the season between two teams. Due to Thornton&#x27;s success, Cheechoo also enjoyed a career-season, winning the Rocket Richard Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top goal-scorer with 56 goals. However, in the 2006 playoffs, Thornton was once again criticized for his play, as his production decreased to two goals and seven assists for nine points in 11 games as the Sharks were ousted in the second round by the eighth seeded Edmonton Oilers. In the off-season, Thornton was honoured for his regular season play and was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27; regular season MVP to go with his Art Ross Trophy. He is the only player in NHL history to win the Hart Trophy while playing for two different teams in the same season.
Thornton began the 2006–07 season being awarded a permanent alternate captaincy, but struggled in the first half of the season while suffering from a toe injury that did not heal until January 2007. After recovering, Thornton enjoyed a productive second half, battling Pittsburgh Penguins centre Sidney Crosby for a second-consecutive scoring title late in the year, eventually finishing six points behind Crosby with 114. With a league-leading 92 assists, Thornton became only the third player in NHL history to record back-to-back 90-assist seasons, joining Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.

Thornton began the 2007 playoffs by recording six assists in the Sharks&#x27; first-round series against the Nashville Predators. Advancing to the second round against the Detroit Red Wings, he recorded a goal and three assists in the first three games of the series. However, Thornton was effectively neutralized by Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström, for the remainder of the series as the Sharks were eliminated in six games.

In the off-season, Thornton signed a three-year contract extension worth US$21.6 million. In the 2007–08 season, Thornton finished with 96 points (29 goals and 67 assists) all 82 games to finish fifth in NHL scoring. 

In 2008–09, Thornton was named captain of the Western Conference for the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal. He completed the season with 86 points to help the Sharks win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions. In the subsequent playoffs, he recorded a goal and four assists in six games as the Sharks were upset in the first round by the eighth seeded Anaheim Ducks.
In September 2009, before the start of the 2009–10 season, the Sharks acquired Dany Heatley in a three-player trade that sent Thornton&#x27;s struggling former linemate Jonathan Cheechoo, left-winger Milan Michálek and a second-round draft pick to the Ottawa Senators. Thornton, Heatley, and Patrick Marleau were joined on the Sharks&#x27; top line and enjoyed immediate offensive success together. The trio helped the Sharks to one of their best-ever regular seasons in franchise history. Although the line&#x27;s production slowed down in the second half of the season, all three Sharks players finished in the League&#x27;s top 15 in point-scoring. Thornton&#x27;s 89 points ranked eighth, while Marleau and Heatley finished 14th and 15th in League scoring with 83 and 82 points, respectively. The Sharks entered the 2010 playoffs as the top seed in the Western Conference for the second-consecutive year and the Presidents&#x27; Trophy runner-up behind the Washington Capitals. After advancing past the eighth seeded Colorado Avalanche and fifth seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first two rounds, the Sharks were eliminated by the second seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in the Western Conference Finals in a four game sweep. Thornton finished the playoffs with a career-high 12 points (three goals, nine assists) in all 15 games.

After the elimination, team management vacated all the Sharks&#x27; captaincy positions, including Thornton&#x27;s role as one of the alternate captains. Prior to the 2010–11 season, he was chosen to replace the retiring Rob Blake as the eighth captain in team history on October 7, 2010. Nine days later, he signed a three-year, US$21 million contract extension with the Sharks. Near the start of the 2010–11 season, Thornton scored the fourth hat-trick of his NHL career against Martin Brodeur in a 5–2 win over the New Jersey Devils. On November 6, 2010, Thornton was suspended two games for a controversial hit to the head against St. Louis Blues forward David Perron. Perron missed the remaining 72 games of the 2010–11 season due to post-concussion syndrome. He returned after missing 97 games over 13 months (394 days) on December 3, 2011. Later in the campaign, Thornton eclipsed Marleau as the Sharks&#x27; all-time leader in assists. Thornton scored his 1,000th career point with a goal in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on April 8, 2011. In the first round of the 2011 playoffs, Thornton scored the series-winning goal in overtime of Game 6 against the seventh seeded Los Angeles Kings to advance the Sharks to the second round where they would meet the third seeded Detroit Red Wings for the second consecutive season and defeat them in seven to clinch a second consecutive appearance in the Western Conference Finals where the Sharks would fall to the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Vancouver Canucks in five games.

On January 24, 2014, Thornton signed a three-year contract extension with the Sharks through to the 2016–17 season.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, Thornton ranked 46th on the all-time points leaders (1,194) and 24th on the all-time assist leaders (852) for the NHL. He also became the San Jose Sharks&#x27; all-time leader in assists with 567. Thornton finished the 2013–14 season with 11 goals and 65 assists as the Sharks amassed 111 points, just six short of their franchise&#x27;s all-time-high mark, and were among the favourites to win the Stanley Cup. Facing their in-state rival Los Angeles Kings in the first round of the 2014 playoffs, the Sharks won the first three games in the series. However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Kings won the next four games and became just the fourth team in NHL history to win a playoff series in seven games after initially trailing three games to none. Thornton finished the playoffs with just two goals and an assist for three points in all seven games.

On August 20, 2014, Sharks head coach Todd McLellan announced that Thornton had been stripped of his captaincy and that the Sharks would start the 2014–15 season without a captain. Joe Pavelski was eventually named Sharks&#x27; captain at the start of the 2015–16 season.

On January 26, 2015, Thornton recorded his 1,300th career point during a game against the Colorado Avalanche with his assist on a Joe Pavelski goal, Thornton&#x27;s second assist of the game. Thornton is the 33rd player in NHL history to reach 1,300 points. Thornton recorded 16 goals and 49 assists during the 2014–15 season as the Sharks failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 2003.

Thornton finished the 2015–16 season with 19 goals and 63 assists for 82 points in 78 contests as the Sharks returned to the playoffs after a one-year slump. In the 2016 playoffs, the Sharks beat the Los Angeles Kings in the first round in five games, avenging a previous loss to them two years earlier. In the second round, they defeated the Nashville Predators in seven games and advanced to the Conference Finals for the first time since 2011, where the Sharks defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. This was also Thornton&#x27;s first time playing in the Finals in his career. However, the Sharks lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games in the Finals. Thornton finished fifth in playoff points with 21 and second in playoff assists with 18. At the end of the season, Thornton was named a Second-Team All-Star for the 2015–16 season.
On March 6, 2017, in a game against the Winnipeg Jets, Thornton recorded his 1,000th NHL assist on a Joe Pavelski goal, becoming the 13th player in NHL history to reach the milestone.

On July 1, 2017, Thornton signed a one-year contract to return to the Sharks for the 2017–18 season. In January 2018, Thornton injured his ACL and MCL and missed the remainder of the season recovering from surgery.

On July 2, 2018, his 39th birthday, Thornton signed a one-year contract to return to the Sharks for the 2018–19 season. On November 13, he scored his 400th career goal against the Nashville Predators to go along with 1,500 games played and 1,000 assists. , this feat has only been achieved by six other players in NHL history. On February 11, 2019, in a 7–2 win over the Vancouver Canucks, Thornton passed Gordie Howe for ninth place on the NHL all-time assists list. Thornton and the Sharks reached the Western Conference Finals, though they were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues in six games. Thornton put up four goals and six assists for 10 points in all 19 games during the playoffs.

Thornton signed a one-year, $2 million contract extension on September 6, 2019, to remain with the Sharks. He recorded his 1,500th career point on February 4, 2020, in a 3–1 win over the Calgary Flames. Thornton expressed dissatisfaction with not being traded to a playoff contending team after the February 24 trade deadline to give him the opportunity to chase a Stanley Cup, as had happened with longtime teammate Patrick Marleau. The Sharks posted a disappointing record this season and did not make the playoffs for the first time since 2015 even with the playoff format being expanded and the regular season ending three weeks early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in North America.

===Toronto Maple Leafs (2020–2021)===
With the 2020–21 season delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Thornton returned to HC Davos of the National League on October 15, 2020, for a third stint. Having held Swiss citizenship since 2019, he did not count against the import limit.

On October 16, 2020, Thornton signed a one-year, $700,000 contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. On December 14, 2020, Thornton left Davos to return to Toronto for the start of training camp. On January 16, 2021, Thornton scored his first goal as a Maple Leaf. On January 22, 2021, Thornton suffered a fractured rib after getting hit by Edmonton Oilers forward Josh Archibald. Thornton returned to the lineup on February 27, recording 20 points (5 goals, 15 assists) in 44 games. Thornton scored one goal in the Maple Leafs&#x27; seven-game series loss to the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the 2021 playoffs.

===Florida Panthers (2021–2022)===
On August 13, 2021, Thornton returned for his 24th NHL season, signing a one-year, $750,000 contract with the Florida Panthers. Thornton played 34 games and scored a career-low 10-points as the Panthers won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions.

=== Retirement ===
Thornton went unsigned for the entirety of the 2022–23 season and start of the 2023–24 season, however there was speculation he could return to the ice. On October 28, 2023, Thornton officially announced his retirement via social media. 

At the time of his retirement, Thornton was 12th in league history in total points scored, seventh in assists, and sixth in games played. During his career he won the Hart Trophy (2005), the Art Ross (2005), a gold medal for Team Canada (2010), appeared in six NHL All Star games, and appeared in the NHL Playoffs 19 times.

On January 17, 2024, the Sharks announced their plans to retire Thornton&#x27;s no. 19 jersey during the 2024–25 season. The Sharks held a weekend-long celebration for Thornton&#x27;s retirement. The festivities included a proclamation at San Jose City Hall declaring November 23 &quot;Joe Thorn Day&quot; in both San Jose, and his hometown of St. Thomas Ontario, a Sharks legends game at Tech CU Arena with Thornton&#x27;s former teammates, and a ceremony to officially retire his no. 19 Jersey prior to the start of a game against the Buffalo Sabres on November 23, 2024.

==International play==




Thornton was named to Canada&#x27;s national under-20 team for the 1997 World Junior Championships in Switzerland. At 17 years old, he recorded four points in seven games, helping Canada to a gold medal. Two years later, he made his debut with the Canadian men&#x27;s team at the 2001 World Championships in Germany. Thornton collected a goal and an assist over six games, as Canada was eliminated in the quarter-finals by the United States.

Thornton&#x27;s next international appearance occurred at the 2004 World Cup. Established by then as a premier player in the NHL, Thornton tied for third in tournament scoring with six points (a goal and five assists) over six games. He notched two assists in the championship game against Finland, helping Canada to a 3–2 win. At the 2005 IIHF World Championship in Austria, Thornton led all scorers with 16 points (six goals and ten assists) in nine games and was named tournament MVP. Canada advanced to the gold medal game, where they were shut-out 3–0 by goaltender Tomáš Vokoun of the Czech Republic.

Thornton made his first appearance in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He recorded three points as Canada was shut out in three of six games, losing to Russia in the quarterfinals. Four years later, he was again chosen to Canada&#x27;s Olympic team for the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Thornton was joined by his Sharks linemates Dany Heatley and Patrick Marleau, as well as Sharks defenceman Dan Boyle, on the squad. The offensive trio of Sharks played on the same line in the Olympics, as well. Thornton registered a goal and an assist over seven games, helping Canada to a gold medal finish.

Thornton was later invited to the Canada&#x27;s hockey camp for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but did not attend due to his son being hospitalized with an illness. He was named to the Canadian roster for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey held in Toronto.

Thornton was named Team Canada&#x27;s co-general manager for the 2023 Spengler Cup.

==Personal life==
Thornton is married to Tabea Pfendsack, whom he met while playing in Switzerland during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. The couple has a daughter and a son. Born in St. Thomas, Ontario, Thornton became a naturalized American citizen in July 2009 at a ceremony in Campbell, California, a suburb of San Jose; he later also received a Swiss passport. Joe and former Sharks teammate Scott Thornton are first cousins.

==In popular culture==
The Tragically Hip lead vocalist Gord Downie&#x27;s song &quot;You Me and the B&#x27;s&quot; (from his 2017 solo album &quot;Introduce Yerself&quot;) includes a lament about Thornton&#x27;s poorly-received trade from the Bruins to the Sharks in 2005.

<doc id="440021" wikidata="Q434859" url="?curid=440021" title="Ilya Kovalchuk">
<text>Ilya Valeryevich Kovalchuk (; born 15 April 1983) is a Russian former professional ice hockey winger. He played for the Atlanta Thrashers, New Jersey Devils, Los Angeles Kings, Montreal Canadiens, and Washington Capitals in the National Hockey League (NHL), as well as Ak Bars Kazan, Khimik Moscow Oblast, SKA Saint Petersburg, Avangard Omsk, and Spartak Moscow in the Russian Superleague (RSL) and Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

Kovalchuk developed in the youth system of Spartak Moscow, joining their senior team in the Vysshaya Liga in 1999. After two seasons with Spartak, he joined the Atlanta Thrashers of the NHL, who selected him first overall in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. After eight seasons with the Thrashers, he was traded to the New Jersey Devils in 2010, with which he signed a 15-year, $100 million contract, after a 17-year, $102 million deal was rejected by the NHL. In 2013, he left the NHL to return to Russia, joining SKA Saint Petersburg, where he played for five seasons before returning to the NHL in 2018. Kovalchuk returned to the KHL for the 2020–21 season, before taking two years off from hockey and ultimately returning to Spartak.

Kovalchuk is tied for fourth all time in the NHL for regular-season overtime goals scored (15) and 18th in goals-per-game average (.511), and is the seventh-highest scoring Russian in NHL history. In the NHL, Kovalchuk has twice been named to the All-Star team, and in 2004 finished in a three-way tie for the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading goal-scorer, sharing it with Jarome Iginla and Rick Nash.

Internationally, Kovalchuk has played for the Russian national junior team in the World U18 Championship and World Junior Championship, and for the Russian national senior team in the World Championship, World Cup and Winter Olympics, winning the 2008 and 2009 World Championships. At his fifth Olympics in 2018, Kovalchuk was named the most valuable player while helping Olympic Athletes from Russia win the gold medal.

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Kovalchuk was born in Kalinin (now Tver), a city roughly 180 kilometres northwest of Moscow, the second child and first son of Valeri and Lyubov. Born big, he was named in honour of Ilya Muromets, a legendary figure from Kievan Rus&#x27;. Kovalchuk&#x27;s father, Valeri, played basketball in Tver; after his career ended, he turned to coaching and was the head of the sport&#x27;s school at the Spartak Olympic reserve in the city from 1980 until 1998, while Lyubov was the head of the #2 polyclinic of the #7 Tver city hospital. Valeri would later write a book detailing Kovalchuk&#x27;s development as a hockey player, titled &quot;From Tver to Atlanta&quot; (Russian: «От Твери до Атланты») and published in 2004; he died in 2005 due to heart disease. Kovalchuk&#x27;s sister, Arina, is seven years older than him. At age seven, Kovalchuk was invited to join the Spartak Moscow youth school, which he went to every weekend, taking the train with his father.

===Marriage and children===
Kovalchuk met his future wife, Nicole Andrazajtis, in 2002 after being introduced by mutual friends. Nicole was a well known singer in Russia at the time and was part of the group Mirage. They married in 2008 at Church of Dormition in Russia. Together they have four children: daughters Karolina and Eva, born in 2005 and 2015; and sons Philipp and Artem, born in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

===Politics===
Kovalchuk is a member of Alexander Ovechkin&#x27;s PutinTeam which was founded in 2017 to promote Vladimir Putin&#x27;s 2018 presidential campaign.

==Playing career==
===Spartak Moscow===
As a youth, Kovalchuk played in the 1997 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with Spartak Moscow. He later played for Vysshaya Liga club Spartak Moscow for two seasons before entering the NHL. Drafted by the Thrashers first overall in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, he became the first Russian to be drafted first overall in the NHL&#x27;s history. In club-level competition, Kovalchuk wore the number 17 as a tribute to Valeri Kharlamov, a Soviet superstar in the 1970s.

===Atlanta Thrashers (2001–2010)===
Entering his NHL rookie season in 2001–02, Kovalchuk scored 29 goals and 51 points despite missing 17 games with a season-ending shoulder injury. He finished second in voting to teammate Dany Heatley for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year. Both were named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. After improving to 38 goals and 67 points in his second season, Kovalchuk scored 41 goals in 2003–04, making him a co-winner of the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy after tying for the NHL lead in goals with Jarome Iginla of the Calgary Flames and Rick Nash of the Columbus Blue Jackets. He also added 46 assists for 87 points, tying him with Joe Sakic of the Colorado Avalanche for second in the NHL that season, behind Martin St. Louis. Kovalchuk also participated in his first NHL All-Star Game in 2004.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Kovalchuk returned to Russia, playing for both Ak Bars Kazan and Khimik Moscow Oblast of the Russian Superleague (RSL). After the lockout, Kovalchuk and the Thrashers could not initially agree to a new contract, so he stayed in Russia, rejoining Khimik Moscow Oblast. He played 11 games for the team, recording 8 goals and 13 points before returning to the Thrashers and NHL after signing a five-year, $32 million contract. During the 2005–06 season, he scored 52 goals, tying him with rookie Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals for third in the NHL in scoring, behind Jonathan Cheechoo of the San Jose Sharks (56) and Jaromír Jágr of the New York Rangers (54). He also tied his career-high of 46 assists for a career-high 98 points, leading the Thrashers in team scoring for the second consecutive season, while finishing eighth overall in NHL scoring. He also became the first Thrashers player to score 50 goals in a season.

In the 2006–07 season, Kovalchuk&#x27;s point production dropped for the first time in his career. He finished with 42 goals and 34 assists for 76 points. During a game against the Nashville Predators on 11 January 2006, Predators head coach Barry Trotz accused Kovalchuk with &quot;always plays with an illegal stick&quot;. Trotz had asked the referees to check Kovalchuk&#x27;s stick following a Thrashers goal, but claimed Kovalchuk was able to switch his stick before the referees could check. Despite his drop in production on the season, Kovalchuk and the Thrashers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Kovalchuk scored one goal and one assist in his NHL playoffs debut as the team lost in the opening round to the New York Rangers in four games.

In 2007–08, Kovalchuk scored two consecutive hat-tricks in a loss to the Ottawa Senators and a win against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 1 and 3 November 2007, respectively. Later that season, on 23 January 2008, Kovalchuk was suspended for one game by the NHL for a hit from behind on New York Rangers defenceman Michal Rozsíval in a game a day prior. He finished with his second 52-goal season in three years, along with 35 assists for 87 points.

With the departure of Bobby Holík to the New Jersey Devils in the 2008 off-season, the Thrashers&#x27; captaincy remained vacant for the first half of the 2008–09 season. Kovalchuk served as one of five alternate captains to start the season until the alternates collectively requested to general manager Don Waddell and head coach John Anderson for Kovalchuk to take over the captaincy. Soon thereafter, on 11 January 2009, Kovalchuk was named Holík&#x27;s successor and the sixth team captain in Thrashers&#x27; history during the team&#x27;s Casino Night charity event. The announcement came amidst speculation that the Thrashers were looking to trade Kovalchuk, as his contract was set to expire at the end of the following season. Kovalchuk completed his first season as team captain with 43 goals for his fifth consecutive 40-goal season and 91 points.

Near the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Kovalchuk scored the 300th and 301st goal of his NHL career in a 4–2 win during the St. Louis Blues&#x27; home opener on 8 October 2009. He was leading the NHL in goals several weeks into the season when he suffered a broken foot after blocking shot in a game against the San Jose Sharks on 24 October.

===New Jersey Devils (2010–2013)===

In the final year of his contract, Kovalchuk and the Thrashers could not come to an agreement on an extension. Thrashers general manager Don Waddell reportedly offered 12-year, $101 million and seven-year, $70 million contracts, both of which Kovalchuk turned down. A few days after Kovalchuk rejected the second contract offer, Waddell told him that he was going to be traded, rather than risk losing him to unrestricted free agency for nothing in the off-season, despite the fact that the Thrashers were still in the playoff race. On 4 February 2010, Kovalchuk was traded to the New Jersey Devils. Atlanta received defenceman Johnny Oduya, rookie forward Niclas Bergfors, junior prospect Patrice Cormier and a first-round selection in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Kovalchuk and defenceman Anssi Salmela; the teams also traded second-round selections in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Kovalchuk left the Thrashers as their all-time leader in several categories, including games played, goals, assists and points. He recorded two assists the following day in his Devils&#x27; debut, a 4–3 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs on 5 February. Kovalchuk eventually ended the season with 41 goals along with 44 assists, for 85 points split between Atlanta and New Jersey. On 10 February 2011, Kovalchuk scored the game-winning goal in a game over the Maple Leafs to give Jacques Lemaire the 600th win of his coaching career.

Kovalchuk recorded a Gordie Howe hat trick – a goal, an assist, and a fight – on 4 February 2012, the second anniversary of his trade to the Devils, against the Philadelphia Flyers. This was the first such hat trick ever recorded by Kovalchuk and second in the Devils&#x27; franchise, following Adam Henrique the month before. Kovalchuk assisted on two goals by teammate Kurtis Foster, scored a short-handed goal, then fought Brayden Schenn after a scrum formed when Flyers forward Zac Rinaldo performed a slew-foot on Devils captain Zach Parise.

Kovalchuk recorded his first scoring hat-trick as a member of the Devils on 14 February 2012, during a 4–1 victory in Buffalo against the Sabres.

On 8 March, Kovalchuk&#x27;s 13th career hat trick and second hat-trick as a New Jersey Devil was recorded. The Devils won 5–1 against the New York Islanders, with Kovalchuk being the first star of the night. On 20 March, Kovalchuk became the 87th player in NHL history to score 400 goals. It was the lone goal of a 1–0 victory over the Ottawa Senators. He was given third star of the night.

Kovalchuk ended the 2011–12 season with seven game-deciding shootout goals and 11 shootout goals in total, setting a new record in both categories. The NHL first introduced shootouts in 2005. Kovalchuk and the Devils won the 2011–12 Eastern Conference finals against the New York Rangers in six games, setting a Stanley Cup meeting with the Los Angeles Kings. Despite leading the 2012 playoffs in scoring through the first three rounds, Kovalchuk was playing with a herniated disc and was largely ineffective against the Kings, scoring just one point in the series, an empty-net goal in game 4, as the Devils fell to the Kings in six games.

====Contract controversy====
Kovalchuk became an unrestricted free agent on 1 July 2010. On 19 July, after receiving offers from other teams, Kovalchuk agreed to a 17-year, $102 million deal to remain with the Devils. The length of the deal broke the record for the longest contract in NHL history. However, the contract was blocked by the NHL the next day on the ground it circumvented the NHL salary cap. Arbitrator Richard Bloch heard the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA)&#x27;s appeal and ultimately nullified the deal.

Another contract was subsequently submitted to the NHL. During the early morning hours of 4 September 2010, the NHL approved the contract along with a new agreement with the NHLPA. The contract was for 15-years and worth $100 million.

Consequently, the NHL penalized the Devils for trying to circumvent the NHL salary cap with Kovalchuk&#x27;s original contract. As a result, the Devils surrendered $3 million, a third-round draft choice in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft and one future first-round draft pick within the next four seasons. The Devils decided to use their first-round draft pick in the 2011 and 2012 NHL Entry Drafts and were to surrender their first-round pick in 2014. However, on 6 March 2014, the NHL announced it would forgive part of the $3 million fine and grant the Devils the 30th pick in the first round of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.

===SKA Saint Petersburg (2013–2018)===
As a result of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Kovalchuk elected to sign a temporary contract with SKA Saint Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on 18 September 2012. Kovalchuk played in Russia until a labor agreement was reached between the NHLPA and the NHL in January, allowing the 2012–13 NHL season to start. Kovalchuk was named captain of SKA Saint Petersburg at his contract signing. In addition, Kovalchuk was the subject of criticism for not returning to the United States immediately after the lockout ended, instead electing to be one of two participating NHL players in the KHL All-Star Game (the other being Pavel Datsyuk). Kovalchuk served as the captain of the Western Conference and returned to the United States to the Devils&#x27; training camp immediately after. He finished the season with 31 points in 37 games for the Devils, and 42 points in 36 games for SKA.
On 11 July 2013, Kovalchuk chose to retire from the NHL. Although Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello knew Kovalchuk had been considering retirement since before the 2012–13 shortened season, Kovalchuk&#x27;s departure came as a surprise to the public. Upon leaving, Kovalchuk had $77 million and 12 years remaining on his contract. Kovalchuk claimed he desired to return home to Russia along with his family, though it was speculated that money had quite an influence as well, due to the higher total salary Kovalchuk would receive in Russia via the far lower Russian tax rate compared to the U.S. Kovalchuk tallied 417 goals and 816 points in 816 games in his first stint in the NHL.

Kovalchuk signed a four-year contract with SKA Saint Petersburg on 15 July 2013. The contract, signed less than a week after Kovalchuk&#x27;s retirement from the NHL, was alleged to be comparable to his former contract with the Devils. He helped the team win the 2014–15 Gagarin Cup for the first time. He was chosen as the MVP of 2015 Gagarin Cup playoffs, but passed the award to Evgenii Dadonov. He won a second Gagarin Cup, again with SKA Saint Petersburg, in 2016–17.

===Los Angeles Kings (2018–2019)===
Kovalchuk announced after the 2017–18 season that he would attempt a return to the NHL. Several teams expressed interest, including the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, San Jose Sharks and Boston Bruins. On 23 June 2018, it was announced Kovalchuk and the Kings had agreed to a three-year contract, effective 1 July, with an average yearly value of $6.25 million. He scored his first goal on 9 October 2018, against the Winnipeg Jets, the franchise he had spent most of his first NHL stint with when they were the Thrashers.

On 5 February 2019, the Kings faced the Devils at Prudential Center. Each time Kovalchuk touched the puck or the PA announcer, Kevin Clark, mentioned his name, Kovalchuk was roundly booed by Devils fans. Kovalchuk scored once as the Kings defeated the Devils 5–1.

With 14 points in his first 14 games, the 2018–19 season had started well for Kovalchuk, but badly for the team. Head coach John Stevens was fired and replaced by Willie Desjardins, who reduced Kovalchuk&#x27;s ice time significantly. As a disappointing season came to a close, Kovalchuk expressed his frustration, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t have a chance&quot; under Desjardins. The day after their season ended, having finished second from the bottom overall, the Kings announced that Desjardins would not be back the following year.

In the 2019–20 season, after Kovalchuk had played his seventeenth game for the Kings, the team announced that he would be scratched for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;. On 17 December the Kings terminated Kovalchuk&#x27;s contract and he became an unrestricted free agent.

===Montreal Canadiens and Washington Capitals (2020)===
On 3 January 2020, Kovalchuk signed a one-year, two-way league minimum contract with the Montreal Canadiens. On 6 January, Kovalchuk played his first game with the Canadiens, against the Winnipeg Jets, and collected one assist in a 3–2 loss. On January 11, Kovalchuk scored his first goal with the Canadiens, the game-winner against the Ottawa Senators in overtime. He quickly became a solid contributor for the Canadiens posting a two goal game three games later and put up eight points in his first eight games for the team.

Despite his contributions, the team was out of the playoff picture and after 22-game and 13-point tenure, Kovalchuk was traded on 23 February 2020 to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft. Kovalchuk recorded four points in seven regular season games and one point in eight playoff games as the Capitals were eliminated in the first round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs by the New York Islanders.

===Avangard Omsk (2020–2021)===
Kovalchuk returned to the KHL for the 2020–21 season, as he signed a two-year contract with Avangard Omsk on 26 December. Kovalchuk won the Gagarin Cup with Avangard on 28 April 2021, and on 30 April 2021, he and Avangard mutually agreed to terminate his contract.

===Return to Spartak (2023–2024)===
After two years away from professional hockey, Kovalchuk opted to return to his youth club of Spartak Moscow, signing a one-year contract on 6 December 2023. On April 9 2024, he announced his retirement.

==International play==






Kovalchuk won his first medals with Russia in a major international event at the IIHF World U18 Championships, earning silver and gold medals in 2000 and 2001, respectively. He also competed for Russia at the World Junior Championships in 2001, but finished seventh.

The following year, Kovalchuk made his senior international debut with Russia at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, during his rookie NHL season with the Atlanta Thrashers. He recorded three points in six games to help Russia to a bronze medal finish. He then made his World Championships debut in 2003, but failed to medal.

Kovalchuk made his second straight Winter Olympics appearance in 2006 in Turin. He had a four-goal game on February 19 in a 9–2 win over Latvia, but returned to Atlanta without a medal, losing in the bronze medal game.

In 2008, Kovalchuk played in the IIHF World Championship, held in Quebec City and Halifax. He scored his only two goals of the tournament in the gold medal game against Team Canada – one to force the game into overtime, then the game-winner to give Russia the championship. The following year, he led Russia to a second straight gold medal over Canada in the 2009 IIHF World Championship and was named the tournament MVP.

In May 2010, Kovalchuk played for Russia at IIHF World Championship in Germany, finishing second.

At the 2015 IIHF World Championship, Kovalchuk served as captain of Russia. After losing the gold medal game to Canada, Kovalchuk and many of the Russian players left the ice after receiving their silver medals, but prior to the playing of the Canadian national anthem. The Russian Hockey Federation was fined for the act, and while the IIHF determined Kovalchuk gave an &quot;unmistakable head gesture&quot; for his team to leave, he was not independently punished.

<doc id="440022" wikidata="Q1549306" url="?curid=440022" title="Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)">
<text>The Highlands and Islands is one of the eight electoral regions of the Scottish Parliament, created in 1999. Eight of the parliament&#x27;s first past the post constituencies are sub-divisions of the region and it elects seven of the 56 additional-member Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs).

The name &quot;Highlands and Islands&quot; is much older than the electoral region. The Highlands and Islands area has a large area of overlap with the Scottish Highlands, and the two names are often regarded as representing the same area.

The Highlands and Islands region is the largest of the eight electoral regions in terms of area, but the smallest in terms of population and electorate. It has boundaries with the North East Scotland, Mid Scotland and Fife and the West Scotland electoral regions.

== Constituencies and council areas ==

=== 2011– ===

As a result of the First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries the boundaries of the region and constituencies were redrawn for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.
=== 1999–2011 ===
The constituencies were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of Westminster constituencies, as existing at that time. They covered all of four council areas, the Highland council area, Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles council area),
the Orkney Isles council area and the Shetland Isles council area, and most of two others, the Argyll and Bute council area and the Moray council area:
A south-eastern portion of the Argyll and Bute area is covered by the Dumbarton constituency, which is in the West of Scotland region. An eastern portion of the Moray area is covered by the Gordon constituency, in the North East Scotland region.

===Boundary changes===

The Boundary Commission also recommended changes to the electoral regions used to elect &quot;list&quot; members of the Scottish Parliament. Highlands and Islands was amended so as to contain the newly redrawn constituencies of Argyll and Bute; Caithness, Sutherland and Ross; Inverness and Nairn; Moray; Na h-Eileanan an Iar; Orkney Islands; Shetland Islands; and Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

<text>Cosmetology (from Greek , &quot;kosmētikos&quot;, &quot;beautifying&quot;; and , &quot;&quot;) is the study and application of beauty treatment. Branches of specialty include hairstyling, skin care, cosmetics, manicures/pedicures, non-permanent hair removal such as waxing and sugaring, and permanent hair removal processes such as electrology and intense pulsed light (IPL).

In the United States as of 2008, an occupational license is required in all states to be a cosmetologist, with the average cost of a certificate from a for-profit school being $17,000 and 1,500 required hours (ten times the hours required for an EMT) with cosmetologists making a median wage of $25,000.

== Cosmetology specialties ==
===Cosmetologist===

Cosmetologists are trained and licensed to perform cosmetic treatments to the hair, skin, and nails. This can be expanded into multiple parts including cutting and chemically treating hair, chemical hair removal, fashion trends, wigs, nails and skin care, skin and hair analysis; relaxation techniques including head, neck, scalp, hand and feet basic massage and aroma therapies; plus ability to expertly apply makeup applications to cover up dark spots or promote and can expand into further specialties such as reflexology; theatrical applications; cosmetics and others as listed below.

=== Hair color specialist ===
A hair color specialist, or hair colorist, specializes in the modification of natural hair color utilizing various application methods while using a colorant product from a professional company. In the US, some colorists are qualified through the American Board of Certified Hair Colorists. This designation is used to recognize colorists that have a greater level of competency in the industry through a written exam and a practical exam. A hair color specialist&#x27;s duties might include, but are not limited to, basic color applications, like covering grey, and lightening or darkening natural hair color. A color specialist is also able to perform corrective color applications and create special effects using foiling techniques or any other advanced color application methods.

=== Shampoo technician ===
A shampoo technician shampoos and conditions a client&#x27;s hair in preparation for the hair stylist. This is generally an apprentice position and a first step for many just out of cosmetology school.

===Esthetician===
Estheticians are licensed professionals who are experts in maintaining and improving skin. An esthetician&#x27;s general scope of practice is limited to the epidermis (the outer layer of skin). Estheticians work in many different environments such as salons, medi-spas, day spas, skin care clinics, and private practices. Estheticians may also specialize in treatments such as microdermabrasion, microcurrent (also known as non-surgical &quot;face lifts&quot;), cosmetic electrotherapy treatments (galvanic current, high frequency), LED (light-emitting diode) treatments, ultrasound/ultrasonic (low level), and mechanical massage (vacuum and G8 muscle vibrating).

An esthetician may undergo special training for treatments such as laser hair removal, permanent makeup application, light chemical peels, eyelash extensions, microblading, and electrology. In the US, estheticians must be licensed in the state in which they are working and are governed by the cosmetology board requirements of that state. Estheticians must complete a minimum 260–1500 hours of training and pass both a written and hands-on exam in order to be licensed in a given state. Utah, Virginia and Washington are the only states at this time to adopt the Master Esthetician License. Additional post graduate training is sometimes required when specializing in areas such as medical esthetics (working in a doctor&#x27;s office). Estheticians work under a dermatologist&#x27;s supervision only when employed by the dermatologist&#x27;s practice. Estheticians treat a wide variety of skin issues that are cosmetic in nature, such as mild acne, hyperpigmentation, and aging skin; therefore, clients with skin disease and disorders are referred to a dermatologist or other medical professional. Estheticians are also referred to as beauticians within North America.

==Occupational hazards==
Many chemicals in salon products pose potential health risks. Examples of hazardous chemicals found in common treatments (e.g. hair coloring, straightening, perms, relaxers, keratin treatments, Brazilian Blowouts, and nail treatments) include dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde, lye (sodium hydroxide), ammonia, and coal tar. Allergies and dermatitis have forced approximately 20% of hairdressers to stop practicing their profession.

In the beauty and cosmetology industries, some of the products used in hair dyes and nail applications contain chemicals that have been shown to have adverse health effects for cosmetologists. A chemical combination known as the toxic trio is often part of the ingredient list in nail polish, hair dyes, and nail polish removers. The toxic trio consists of formaldehyde, toluene and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). DBP is commonly found in nail polish and is used as a binder to increase the amount of time that the polish stays on the nail. Toluene is an industrial solvent and is usually in nail polish removers. Formaldehyde can be found in a variety of beauty products but is generally found in hair straightening products and hair dyes as well as in some nail polishes. Each chemical member of the toxic trio has independently been found to have adverse reproductive effects in humans, so there concern that the presence of all three chemicals in cosmetologist supplies could pose a detrimental health risk for cosmetologists.

===Demographics of the cosmetology industry===
As a profession, cosmetology is predominantly female, most of whom are of reproductive age. There are more than one million women registered and licensed as cosmetologists in the United States and roughly several million more work as hair stylists. Among cosmetologists, hairdressers and nail technicians make up a large part of the working population. Many cosmetologists begin their careers before reproductive age and before family planning, which may put them at higher risk for reproductive health effects from exposure to workplace cosmetology chemicals.

In the United States the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for public safety regarding cosmetic products and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates these products. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) utilizes an &quot;Expert Panel&quot; to review available data on cosmetic ingredients and determine whether or not chemical ingredients in cosmetic products are safe to use considering how they are currently utilized. However, this protocol is only helpful if applied to all cosmetology workplaces in the United States.

An investigation carried out by the Environmental Working Group revealed only 11% of more than 10,000 cosmetic ingredients documented by the FDA were evaluated in a CIR review. Research studies have shown that although &quot;toxicological considerations play an increasingly significant role in product formulation; reproductive risks are not typically taken into account. It is also known that, &quot;more than 9,000 chemicals are found in cosmetic products&quot;. Hairdressers use a wide range of products containing chemicals. &quot;Hair dyes represent the largest segment of chemical products in the hair market today. As such, they are the main source of chemical exposure among hairdressers&quot;.

===Chemical exposures===
===Toluene===
Toluene is a clear, water insoluble liquid with a distinct and pungent smell, similar to paint thinners. Toluene is found in cosmetic products such as nail polish, nail glue, and hair dyes and is widely used as an industrial solvent and is used to make fingernail polishes, lacquers, adhesives, rubber, and paint thinners. It is used in the production of benzene, gasoline, nylon, plastics, and polyurethane. Toluene can be found on cosmetic labels under the names, benzene, toluol, phenylmethane, and methylbenzene.

Toluene enters the environment when materials like fingernail polish, paints, paint thinners, and adhesives are used. It rapidly mixes with the air and individuals who work with paint, lacquer, or dyes have greater exposures to toluene via dermal and respiratory routes. Toluene inhalation during pregnancy has led to neonatal effects, including intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery, congenital malformations, and postnatal developmental retardation.

====Dibutyl phthalate====
Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a manufactured chemical used as a plasticizer. It is used to make plastics more flexible and can be found in paints, glue, insect repellents, hair spray, nail polish, and rocket fuel. Due to its flexibility and film forming properties, it is an ideal ingredient in cosmetics and cosmetology products. DBP is mainly used in nail products as a solvent for dyes and as a plasticizer that prevents nail polishes from becoming brittle, but is also used in hair sprays, to help avoid stiffness by allowing them to form a flexible film on the hair.

Dibutyl phthalate has been linked to reproductive issues in humans if the mother is exposed while pregnant and has been banned for use by the European Union and certain phthalate esters have been shown to cause reproductive toxicity in animal models.

====Formaldehyde====
Formaldehyde is a colorless, strong smelling liquid that is highly volatile, making exposure to both workers and clients potentially unhealthy. Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classify formaldehyde as a human carcinogen. Formaldehyde has been linked to nasal and lung cancer, with possible links to brain cancer and leukemia.

Growing evidence reveals that various popular hair-smoothing treatments contain formaldehyde and release formaldehyde as a gas. Formaldehyde is a common ingredient in Brazilian blowouts, Cadiveu, and Keratin Complete Smoothing Therapies. Four laboratories in California, Oregon, and Canada, confirmed a popular hair straightening treatment, the Brazilian Blowout, contained between 4% and 12% formaldehyde. Oregon OSHA demonstrated that other keratin-based hair smoothing products also contain formaldehyde, with concentrations from 1% to 7%.

Formaldehyde may be present in hair smoothing solutions or as a vapor in the air. Stylists and clients may inhale formaldehyde as a gas or a vapor into the lungs and respiratory tract. Formaldehyde vapor can also make contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or throat. Formaldehyde solutions may be absorbed through the skin during the application process of liquid hair straighteners. Solutions of formaldehyde can release formaldehyde gas at room temperature and heating such solutions can speed up this process. Exposure often occurs when heat is applied to the treatment, via blow drying and flat ironing.

Stylists and clients have reported acute health problems while using or after using certain hair smoothing treatments containing formaldehyde. Reported problems include nose-bleeds, burning eyes and throat, skin irritation and asthma attacks. Other symptoms related to formaldehyde exposure include watery eyes; runny nose; burning sensation or irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat; dry and sore throat; respiratory tract irritation; coughing; chest pain; shortness of breath; wheezing; loss of sense of smell; headaches; and fatigue.

===Reproductive health and birth defects of the toxic trio===
The presence of Formaldehyde, phthalates, and toluene (the toxic trio) in the work environment play a role in the risk of reproductive health effects for cosmetologists. Studies shows that there is a significant increase in premature birth and an increased risk of pregnancy disorders when hairdressers were compared to a referent group of teachers and salesclerks where the only occupational difference were exposure to the toxic trio. Hairdressers and cosmetologists have a slightly increased risk of having an infant with small gestational age. Reproductive disorders in relation to low birth weight were examined and found an increased risk of having infant with low birth weight; three of these studies showed a significant increase.

Case studies on toluene exposures have found increased incidences of urogenital, gastrointestinal, and cardiac anomalies among children of mothers who were exposed to organic solvents, such as toluene. Associations were found between pregnant women who inhaled Formaldehyd, phthalates, and toluene and adverse reproductive outcomes such as intrauterine growth retardation and premature delivery. Hairdressers report premature ovarian failure five times more frequently than women in non-cosmetologist occupations.

==Regulation of cosmetics in the U.S.==
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) defines cosmetics as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body…for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering appearance”. Products such as nail polish, hair coloring, straightening formulas, and shampoos fall under this definition of cosmetics. In the U.S., the FDA does not mandate premarket approval for cosmetic ingredients or products, with the exception of color. Additionally, the FDA is not legally responsible for cosmetic product or ingredient safety and does not have the authority to require manufactures to submit their safety data to the FDA. Instead, the cosmetic manufacturer is legally responsible for correctly labeling and producing their products with safe ingredients. U.S. cosmetic companies are also not required to register their product or ingredients with the FDA as registration is purely voluntary. The FDA cannot legally order a recall of cosmetic products in the U.S. even if they have been shown to have poor health outcomes. A product recall relies on the cosmetic manufacturer and is therefore completely voluntary.

In contrast, the European Union requires cosmetic products to undergo premarket safety testing and requires mandatory cosmetology product and ingredient registration. In general, the European Union approaches cosmetics and their production under the precautionary principle. The EU has banned 1,328 chemicals from use in cosmetics and does not permit animal testing for cosmetics.

===OSHA requirements regarding formaldehyde===
OSHA requires manufacturers, importers, and distributors to identify formaldehyde on any product that contains more than 0.1% formaldehyde (as a gas or in a solution), or if the product can release formaldehyde at concentrations greater than 0.1 parts per million (ppm). Safety data sheets (SDS) must also accompany the product and kept on premises with the product at all times. The SDS must explain why a chemical in the product is hazardous, how it is harmful, how workers can protect themselves, and what they should do in an emergency.

Salon owners and stylists are advised to look closely at the hair smoothing products they use (read product labels and SDS sheets) to see if they contain methylene glycol, formalin, methylene oxide, paraform, formic aldehyde, methanal, oxomethane, oxymethylene, or CAS Number 50-00-0. According to OSHA&#x27;s Formaldehyde standard, a product containing any of these names should be treated as a product containing formaldehyde. OSHA&#x27;s Hazard Communication standard (Right to Know) states that salon owners and other employers&#x27; must have a SDS for products containing hazardous chemicals. If salon owners or other employers decide to use products that contain or release formaldehyde they are required to follow the guidelines in OSHA&#x27;s Formaldehyde standard.

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), is responsible for inspections of worker health and safety. It is estimated 375,000 nail technicians work in nail salons in the United States. Yet in 2005, OSHA inspected only 18 nail salons because businesses are exempt from inspection if they have 10 employees or less. According to the Asian American Resource Workshop, Vietnamese nail salon workers hold 40% of nail technician licenses in the United States. &quot;It&#x27;s long hours, low hourly pay, and fierce competition from every corner of the block&quot; and with such fierce competition between businesses, salaries are reduced even further. As a result, a majority of these immigrants are subject to low socioeconomic status; which subsequently reduces opportunity to be educated about the occupational chemicals they are exposed to in the workplace and reduces opportunity to seek health care if adverse health effects are experienced from chemical exposure.

==Cosmetology careers==

In the United States, whether planning to study cosmetology or specialize in a specific area, each state has different requirements that must be fulfilled before obtaining a license.

For example, the State of Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations requires each candidate to complete their hours through a licensed cosmetology school program where new skills are taught and learned such as hair coloring, styling, hair cutting and the usage of hazardous chemicals. After completing the minimum hours to obtain a state license, an online examination is required and is submitted via mail with other supported documentation. Bureau of Labor Statistics states that the median salary for a licensed cosmetologist is $28,770 as of May 2015. Illinois Metropolitan Division Areas, Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights has one of the highest employment rates with an annual rate of $27,750. Being a licensed cosmetologist opens the door to becoming self-employed and working at high-end salons. As a licensed cosmetologist, each has the option to choose which salon fits best to work in but a self-employed salon will bring more income as long as having the right business plan for it to succeed. Each candidate registering for a salon has to obtain a certificate of registration and present all required paperwork with the FEIN, Federal employer identification number to Illinois Department of Labor.

However, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, cosmetology schools are expensive and train students for low-paid jobs that do not allow students to pay back the debt. Iowa has the strictest requirements for a cosmetology degree: 2,100 hours of instruction. &quot;The Times&quot; interviewed over twenty former students. One typical student paid $21,000 for tuition and supplies at the Iowa School of Beauty. After getting her license in 2005, she was hired at a local Great Clips, at $9 an hour. Thirteen years after graduating, she owes more than $8,000 on her loans. In contrast, an Iowa emergency medical technician certification at a community college requires only 132 hours, according to the Times. Iowa is particularly expensive, but for-profit beauty schools across the U.S. charge an average of $17,000 for a cosmetology certificate.

Community colleges would be cheaper, but when Iowa Central Community College applied to the state cosmetology board in 2004 to start a program, the Iowa Cosmetology School Association and La’ James International College sued, arguing that the state code prohibits public entities from competing with private entities. The community college agreed not to give certificate programs. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the cosmetology schools have prevented efforts to lower the number of hours required for a certificate.

In the United Kingdom, Typically there are two routes to training in cosmetology. An NVQ (National Vocational Qualification) is a backbone qualification designed for those starting out in the industry. Short courses are bolt-on courses that specialise into further fields of cosmetology. Both of these options allow a qualified beautician to gain public liability insurance cover.

Similarly, in India, there are many beauty and wellness training academies that provide a foundation and advanced courses in cosmetology. On graduating, students in India can work as professional cosmetologists in cosmetology schools, spas and wellness centres, beauty parlours, skin clinics, cosmetic companies, film and fashion industry, or as independent cosmetologists.

<doc id="440025" wikidata="Q3084294" url="?curid=440025" title="1923 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1923 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 6 December 1923. The Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, won the most seats, but Labour, led by Ramsay MacDonald, and H. H. Asquith&#x27;s reunited Liberal Party gained enough seats to produce a hung parliament. It is the most recent UK general election in which a third party won over 100 seats (158 for the Liberals) and the most narrow gap (100 seats) between the first and third parties since. The Liberals&#x27; percentage of the vote, 29.7%, trailed Labour&#x27;s by only one percentage point and has not been exceeded by a third party at any general election since.

MacDonald formed the first Labour government with tacit support from the Liberals. Rather than trying to bring the Liberals back into government, Asquith&#x27;s motivation for permitting Labour to enter power was that he hoped they would prove to be incompetent and quickly lose support. Being a minority, MacDonald&#x27;s government only lasted ten months and another general election was held in October 1924.
==Overview==
In May 1923, Prime Minister Bonar Law fell ill and resigned on 22 May, after just 209 days in office. He was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stanley Baldwin. The Labour Party had also changed leaders since the previous election, after J. R. Clynes was defeated in a leadership challenge by former leader Ramsay MacDonald.

Having won an election just the year before, Baldwin&#x27;s Conservative Party had a comfortable majority in the House of Commons and could have waited another four years, but the government was concerned and the Conservatives were divided. Baldwin felt the need to receive a mandate from the people, which, if successful, would strengthen his grip on the Conservative Party leadership and allow him to introduce tariff reform and imperial preference as protectionist trade policies over the objections of the free trade elements of his party.

Oxford historian and Conservative MP John Marriott depicts the gloomy national mood:

Parliament was dissolved on 16 November and the result backfired on Baldwin, who lost a host of seats to Labour and the Liberals, resulting in a hung parliament. A reformation of the Conservative-Liberal coalition which had governed the country from 1918 to 1922 was not practical, as Baldwin had alienated both of the two most prominent Liberals, Asquith and David Lloyd George.

=== Aftermath ===
Faced with the decision of whether to support a minority Conservative or Labour government on an issue-by-issue basis, Asquith ultimately chose to support the Labour government. This decision was influenced by Lloyd George&#x27;s faction, which was strongly opposed to collaborating with Baldwin, and the belief amongst the Liberals as a whole that Labour&#x27;s electoral success was largely due to the previous split within the Liberal Party. Asquith anticipated that a Labour government would reveal Labour&#x27;s policies as impractical, thereby enabling the Liberals to surpass them in the subsequent election. Consequently, the Liberals joined forces with Labour to defeat Baldwin&#x27;s King&#x27;s Speech, leading to the fall of his government and allowing Labour to form its first government.

<text>Glasgow is one of the eight electoral regions of the Scottish Parliament. Nine of the parliament&#x27;s 73 first past the post constituencies are sub-divisions of the region and it elects seven of the 56 additional-member Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Thus it elects a total of 16 MSPs.

== Constituencies and council areas ==

===2011– ===

As a result of the First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries the boundaries of the region and constituencies were redrawn for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.

Eight of the constituencies are entirely within the Glasgow City council area. The Rutherglen constituency comprises the extreme north-western part of the South Lanarkshire council area which is part of the Greater Glasgow urban area. The South Lanarkshire area is otherwise divided between the Central Scotland and South of Scotland regions.

=== 1999–2011 ===

In terms of first past the post constituencies the region included:
The constituencies were created with the names and boundaries of Westminster constituencies, as existing in 1999. Scottish Westminster constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies in 2005. Holyrood constituencies were unaltered.

<doc id="440027" wikidata="Q3084303" url="?curid=440027" title="1922 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1922 United Kingdom general election was held on Wednesday 15 November 1922. It was won by the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law, which gained an overall majority over the Labour Party, led by J. R. Clynes, and a divided Liberal Party.

This election is considered one of political realignment, with the Liberal Party falling to third-party status. The Conservative Party went on to spend all but eight of the next forty-two years as the largest party in Parliament, and Labour emerged as the main competition to the Conservatives.

The election was the first not to be held in Southern Ireland, due to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921, under which Southern Ireland was to secede from the United Kingdom as a Dominion – the Irish Free State – on 6 December 1922. This reduced the size of the House of Commons by nearly one hundred seats when compared to the previous election.

==Background==
The Liberal Party had divided into two factions following the ousting of H. H. Asquith as Prime Minister in December 1916. From then until October 1922 the Conservatives had been in coalition with a Liberal faction (which later became the &quot;National Liberals&quot;) led by David Lloyd George. Following the Carlton Club meeting, Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister and Bonar Law formed a Conservative majority government.

Although still leader of the Liberal Party and a frequent public speaker, former Prime Minister Asquith was no longer a particularly influential figure in the national political debate, and he had played no part in the downfall of the Lloyd George coalition. Most attention was focused on Law and Lloyd George. Asquith&#x27;s daughter Violet Bonham-Carter, a prominent Liberal Party campaigner, likened the election to a contest between a man with sleeping sickness (Bonar Law) and a man with St Vitus Dance (Lloyd George).

Some of Lloyd George&#x27;s National Liberals were not opposed by Conservative candidates (e.g. Winston Churchill, who was defeated at Dundee nonetheless), while many leading Conservatives (e.g. former parliamentary leaders Arthur Balfour and Sir Austen Chamberlain, and former Lord Chancellor Lord Birkenhead) were not members of Bonar Law&#x27;s government, and hoped to hold the balance of power after the election (comparisons were made with the Peelite group—the ousted Conservative front bench of the late 1840s and 1850s); this was not to be, as Bonar Law won an overall majority.

It was the first election at which Labour surpassed the combined strength of both Liberal parties in votes and seats. The election was also notable for Labour in that it saw future Prime Minister Clement Attlee elected as MP for Limehouse.

Some Liberal candidates stood calling for a reunited Liberal Party, while others appear to have backed both Asquith and Lloyd George. Few sources are able to agree on exact numbers, and even in contemporary records held by the two groups, some MPs were claimed for both sides. By one estimate, there were 29 seats where Liberals stood against one another. This is thought to have cost them at least 14 seats, 10 of them to Labour, so in theory a reunited Liberal Party would have been much closer to, and perhaps even ahead of, Labour in terms of seats. However, in reality the two factions were on poor terms, and Lloyd George was still hoping for a renewed coalition with the Conservatives.

Neither of the leaders of the two main parties succeeded in enjoying their achievement in the election for very long; within less than a month of the election, Clynes was defeated in a leadership challenge by former Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald, while Bonar Law would only last a little over seven months as Prime Minister before being forced to step down due to a terminal illness, resulting in Stanley Baldwin succeeding him as both party leader and Prime Minister. As a result, Bonar Law was the shortest-serving UK Prime Minister of the twentieth century. Parliament was dissolved on 26 October; Bonar Law died four days later.

==Party platforms==
The Conservative Party offered continuity to the electorate. Bonar Law&#x27;s election address stated:

The Labour Party proposed to nationalise the mines and railways, to impose a levy on financial capital, and to revise the peace treaties. It promised a higher standard of living for workers, higher wages, and better housing.

<text>Martin St. Louis (French spelling Martin St-Louis, ; born June 18, 1975) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player who is the head coach for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). An undrafted player, St. Louis played a total of 1,134 games, scoring 391 goals and 1,033 points in an NHL career that began with the Calgary Flames in 1998 and ended with the New York Rangers in 2015. He is best remembered for having played with the Tampa Bay Lightning and was a member of the Lightning&#x27;s 2004 Stanley Cup championship team. St. Louis also briefly played with HC Lausanne of the Swiss National League A. He was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018; his first year of eligibility. St. Louis is widely considered one of the best undrafted players of all time. On January 17, 2017, St. Louis&#x27; number 26 jersey became the first to be retired in Lightning history.

A standout player in college for the Vermont Catamounts, St. Louis earned East Coast Athletic Conference (ECAC) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) all-American honors for three consecutive seasons between 1995 and 1997 and was named the ECAC Player of the Year in 1995. As a professional, St. Louis played in six All-Star Games. He was voted the recipient of the Lester B. Pearson Award and Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player as chosen by the players and league respectively in 2003–04, also winning his first Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading scorer with 94 points. St. Louis has on three occasions won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player. In 2013, at age 37, he won his second Art Ross Trophy, becoming the oldest player to ever lead the NHL in scoring. He has also led the NHL in assists in two different seasons (2003–04 and 2012–13).

Internationally, St. Louis has played for Canada on several occasions. He was a member of the team that won the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and is a two-time silver medalist at the World Championships; he was named a tournament all-star after leading the 2009 event in scoring with 15 points. A two-time Olympian, St. Louis was a member of Canada&#x27;s gold medal-winning team at the 2014 Winter Games.

==Early life==
St. Louis was born in Laval, Quebec, to Normand and France St. Louis. He has a sister, Isabelle.

As a youth, St. Louis played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Laval, Quebec. He was passed over for a provincial team at a midget age tournament despite leading his league in scoring. He played one season of junior ice hockey with the Hawkesbury Hawks of the Central Junior Hockey League (CJHL) in 1992–93 where he scored 37 goals and 87 points in just 31 games.

==Playing career==

===College===
St. Louis was listed at tall in college. He often struggled to gain recognition for his ability, while teams showed little interest in him. He was heavily recruited by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools to play for their programs, however. The University of Vermont Catamounts convinced St. Louis to join their hockey program. He had 51 points in 33 games in his freshman season of 1993–94 and was named to the East Coast Athletic Conference&#x27;s All-Rookie Team.

In his sophomore season (1994–95), St. Louis was among the top scorers in the NCAA. He had 71 points in 35 games and was named both an ECAC First Team All-Star and NCAA All-American for the first of three consecutive seasons. Additionally, he was named the ECAC Player of the Year. Named team captain for his junior season, St. Louis scored 85 points in 35 games. He tied friend and teammate Éric Perrin for the NCAA scoring lead and the pair, along with goaltender Tim Thomas, led the Catamounts to the first ECAC hockey championship in school history. Named an all-star at the 1996 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament, St. Louis scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Lake Superior State to reach the Frozen Four. The Catamounts lost the national semi-final to Colorado College, 4–3, in double overtime.

A finalist for the Hobey Baker Award for the first of two consecutive seasons, St. Louis earned interest from National Hockey League (NHL) teams in the summer of 1996. Teams offered signing bonuses of up to $150,000 hoping to convince him to leave Vermont and turn professional. Believing he could attract similar offers the following year, he chose to complete his final year of college eligibility. His offensive numbers slipped in 1996–97 as he scored 59 points in 36 games. St. Louis finished as Vermont&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 267 points, a record he continues to hold as of 2023, as well as his school mark of 176 assists. He won the J. Edward Donnelly Award as the top male senior athlete at the University of Vermont in 1997 and was named to the ECAC&#x27;s all-decade team of the 1990s. The University of Vermont inducted him into its athletics Hall of Fame in 2007, and in 2012 he was presented with the school&#x27;s Alumni Achievement Award. On January 8, 2016, the University of Vermont retired his jersey number 8 at Gutterson Fieldhouse in front of a sold-out crowd.

===Calgary Flames (1998–2000)===
The NHL offers St. Louis anticipated never materialized as teams lost interest in him. Only the Ottawa Senators offered him a tryout prior to the 1997–98 NHL season. When they released him, St. Louis signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Lumberjacks that included a clause allowing him to leave the team if offered an NHL contract. He had 50 points in 56 games for Cleveland, catching the attention of the Calgary Flames, who signed him to a contract on February 18, 1998. He was assigned to their then-American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Saint John Flames, where he scored 26 points in 25 regular season games. He then added 20 points in 20 playoff games as Saint John reached the Calder Cup finals, losing in six games to the Philadelphia Phantoms.

St. Louis earned a spot on the Calgary roster to begin the 1998–99 season and made his NHL debut on October 9, 1998, against the San Jose Sharks. He scored his first goal on October 20 against Dallas Stars&#x27; goaltender Roman Turek. He began the season playing with Calgary&#x27;s top forward, Theoren Fleury, but was quickly demoted to the fourth line, and often sat out of the lineup. He appeared in only 13 games in Calgary, spending the majority of the season in Saint John where he led the AHL squad with 28 goals and 62 points. He began the 1999–2000 season with Saint John, but earned a recall to Calgary after scoring 26 points in 17 games. St. Louis completed his first full NHL season with 3 goals and 18 points in 56 games. Pleased with his progress, general manager Al Coates picked up St. Louis&#x27; contract option for the 2000–01 season. However, the organization fired Coates and his staff that summer and the new management team was not interested in retaining St. Louis. The Flames exposed him in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft, but after he went unselected, the team bought out his contract and made him an unrestricted free agent.

===Tampa Bay Lightning (2000–2014)===

A few teams expressed interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed they were the most likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in on November 22, 2000, and finished the season playing in 78 games with 18 goals, 22 assists and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.

While leading the team with 16 goals midway through the 2001–02 season, St. Louis suffered a broken leg following an awkward check by Josef Melichar of the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 23, 2002. Consequently, he appeared in only 53 of Tampa Bay&#x27;s 82 games, finishing with 35 points. 

He had a breakout season in 2002–03, finishing fourth in team scoring with 70 points and tying Vincent Lecavalier for the team lead with 33 goals along with 37 assists. He led the team in plus-minus at +10 and appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game. St. Louis won the puck control relay event and finished second in the fastest skater events of the 2003 All-Star Game&#x27;s skills competition. He scored his first career hat-trick on January 30, 2003, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes. In the 2003 playoffs, Tampa Bay won its first playoff series in franchise history when they eliminated the Washington Capitals. Three of St. Louis&#x27; seven goals were game-winners, including the overtime goal in the sixth game that won the series against the sixth-seeded Capitals before falling in five games in the second round to the second-seeded New Jersey Devils. He led the team with 12 points (seven goals, five assists) in all 11 playoff games.

St. Louis exceeded his previous season in 2003–04, capturing the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading scorer with 94 points (38 goals, 56 assists). His plus-minus of +38 led the league. He scored his 100th career goal on February 17, 2004, against the Philadelphia Flyers. He led the 2004 playoffs with 15 assists and finished with 24 playoff points in 23 games. He led the Lightning to the Stanley Cup Finals against St. Louis&#x27; former team, the Calgary Flames, against whom he scored the overtime winning goal on Miikka Kiprusoff in game six to force a deciding seventh game of the series. The Lightning won the game 2–1 to secure the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup. St. Louis won several postseason awards: He was named a first team All-Star and voted recipient of the Lester B. Pearson Award as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player as selected by the players. He also won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player. St. Louis was only the eighth player in NHL history to win the Art Ross and Hart Trophies and the Stanley Cup in the same season, and the first to do so since Wayne Gretzky in 1986–87.

While the 2004–05 NHL season was ultimately cancelled by a labour dispute, St. Louis spent it playing in Europe. He signed a contract with HC Lausanne of Switzerland&#x27;s National League A. He scored 25 points in 23 games. When the NHL resumed in 2005–06, St. Louis signed a six-year contract extension with the Lightning worth US$31.5 million. He finished with his third 30-goal season, but scored only 61 points on the campaign.

The 2006–07 season was St. Louis&#x27; greatest offensive year as he topped the 100-point plateau for the first time. He finished with career highs in goals, (43), and points, (102). He played in his 500th career game on February 9, 2007, against the New York Rangers and after becoming the first Lightning player to appear in three All-Star Games, became the first to score a goal in the mid-season event. He was named to the second All-Star team following the season. An injury to Tim Taylor resulted in St. Louis being named an alternate captain in 2007–08. St. Louis made his fourth All-Star Game appearance in 2007–08 amidst an 83-point campaign. He scored his 500th career point with a goal against the Buffalo Sabres on March 19, 2008. Leading the Lightning with 30 goals, 50 assists and 80 points in 2008–09, St. Louis earned his fifth All-Star appearance.

St. Louis finished fifth in the league with 94 points in 2009–10. He had two 11-game point streaks during the season, the longest in franchise history, and was named to the second All-Star team. Finishing with only 12 penalty minutes on the season, he was voted the recipient of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player. It was the fifth time he had been named a finalist for the award. 

He won the Lady Byng Trophy for a second time in 2010–11, the culmination of a season in which St. Louis made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, was named to the second All-Star team for the third time and finished second in league scoring with 99 points (31 goals, 68 assists) only behind Daniel Sedin of the Vancouver Canucks, who finished with 104 points. He was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy for the second time, losing out to Anaheim Ducks forward Corey Perry.

The 2011–12 season was the first under a four-year contract extension signed during the previous campaign. Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman praised St. Louis&#x27; importance to the organization when announcing the signing: &quot;Marty means so much to this franchise, both on and off the ice. His hard work and dedication are unsurpassed and we are thrilled that he will finish his career here in Tampa Bay.&quot; A durable player, St. Louis held the NHL&#x27;s third longest &quot;ironman&quot; streak among active players, having played every game since 2005. The streak came to an end at 499 consecutive games played in early December 2011 when he was struck in the face by a shot from teammate Dominic Moore during practice. Despite suffering facial and sinus fractures, he missed only five games due to the injury. The 36-year-old St. Louis finished the season with 74 points (25 goals, 49 assists) in 77 games.

In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, St. Louis led the NHL with 43 assists, and his 60 points were enough to capture his second Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading scorer. After the season, he was named a second team All-Star. With only 14 penalty minutes on the season, St. Louis also won his third Lady Byng Trophy.

The Lightning named St. Louis the ninth captain in franchise history prior to the 2013–14 season. He replaced Vincent Lecavalier, who departed Tampa in the off-season. St. Louis played his 1,000th NHL game on November 19, 2013, against the Los Angeles Kings. He is the 286th player in NHL history to reach the milestone, but only the 16th undrafted player to do so since the creation of the universal NHL Entry Draft in 1969. In his 1,000th game, he recorded an assist on a goal scored by Valtteri Filppula. St. Louis set a career high and tied a Lightning franchise record by scoring four goals in a January 18, 2014, game against the San Jose Sharks. His 600th career assist came two weeks later on a goal scored by Victor Hedman in a 5–3 loss to the Ottawa Senators on January 30.

===New York Rangers (2014–2015)===

In January 2014, then-Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman, who also served as the general manager for Canada&#x27;s team at the 2014 Winter Olympics, elected not to include St. Louis on Canada&#x27;s roster. St. Louis was ultimately named to the team as an injury replacement after Steven Stamkos was not medically cleared to play. At the same time, St. Louis requested a trade from Tampa Bay. The no movement clause in his contract gave St. Louis control over where he could be moved and he reportedly consented to only being traded to the New York Rangers, a request he first made in 2009. The Lightning honoured his request, and St. Louis was sent to New York along with a conditional 2015 second-round pick on March 5, 2014, in exchange for Ryan Callahan, a 2015 first-round draft pick, a conditional 2014 second-round pick (which became a first-round pick) and a conditional 2015 seventh-round pick. Both of the first-round draft picks acquired by the Lightning in this trade were eventually traded to the New York Islanders. Though reluctant to speak of his reasons for requesting the trade, he eventually admitted the initial Olympic snub was the primary cause. He felt a lack of respect when Yzerman initially left him off the Canadian team. St. Louis also expressed his regret over the damage the events caused to his relationship with the fans in Tampa.

St. Louis struggled offensively in his first games with the Rangers as he went 14 games without scoring a goal. He scored only one in 19 regular season games – finishing the season with 30 combined between Tampa Bay and New York – and added seven assists to finish with 69 points on the season. The death of his mother, France, of a heart attack on May 8 left St. Louis&#x27; participation in Games 5 and 6 of New York&#x27;s second-round playoff series against the Pittsburgh Penguins in doubt. He chose to play after speaking with his father. The Rangers players rallied around St. Louis as he became the team&#x27;s focus. He led the Rangers as they overcame a 3–1 series deficit against Pittsburgh to win the series in seven games &quot;en route&quot; to reaching the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals. St. Louis led the team with 8 goals in the playoffs and finished second with 15 points, but the Rangers lost the final to the Los Angeles Kings in five games.

St. Louis returned to the Rangers for what would be his last NHL season in 2014–15, and was named an alternate captain underneath newly appointed captain Ryan McDonagh.

St. Louis made his first return to Tampa Bay on November 26, and was welcomed with a video tribute and standing ovation from the fans prior to the start of the game, which Tampa won 5–4. Two days later, St. Louis recorded a goal and an assist against the Philadelphia Flyers to reach 1,000 points in his career, becoming the sixth undrafted player in NHL history to do so. St. Louis would face the Lightning again in the 2015 Eastern Conference Final, in a series Tampa Bay won in seven games. St. Louis finished the 2015 playoff campaign with 1 goal and 6 assists in 19 playoff games.

The Rangers did not offer St. Louis a new contract during the off-season, despite his desire to return to the team. Despite receiving other offers in free agency, St. Louis formally announced his retirement from professional hockey on July 2, 2015.

==International play==



Following his MVP season in the NHL, St. Louis joined Team Canada for the first time, appearing at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. With a goal and an assist, he led Canada to an opening game, 2–1 victory over the United States. Overall, he scored four points in six games as Canada won the World Cup. The majority of that team returned for the 2006 Winter Olympic tournament, and St. Louis played in his first Olympic Games. The team struggled offensively throughout the tournament, finishing in seventh place. St. Louis scored two goals and added an assist in six games.

St. Louis has twice played in the World Championships. He first played in the 2008 tournament, held in Canada. He appeared in all nine games for Team Canada, scoring ten points. Canada reached the final, but were forced to settle for the silver medal after a 5–4 overtime loss to Russia. Returning for the 2009 World Championship in Switzerland, St. Louis led the tournament in scoring with 15 points. Canada met Russia in a rematch of the 2008 final, however St. Louis and his teammates were again relegated to the silver medal, dropping a 2–1 decision. St. Louis was named to the tournament&#x27;s all-star team at forward. He was selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics. On February 6, 2014, he was selected to replace injured former Lightning teammate Steven Stamkos for representation at the 2014 Winter Olympics and played in five of Canada&#x27;s six games. St. Louis won an Olympic gold medal with Canada in a 3–0 victory over Sweden in the gold medal game.

==Coaching career==
In 2017, St. Louis was offered the position of head coach of the Hartford Wolf Pack, the AHL affiliate of the New York Rangers, by Rangers general manager Jeff Gorton. He declined, citing a desire to focus on his sons&#x27; youth hockey teams.

Interest in St. Louis&#x27; services on a professional level persisted. On January 21, 2019, he became the special teams consultant for the Columbus Blue Jackets, working alongside his former Tampa Bay Lightning head coach, John Tortorella.

===Montreal Canadiens (2022–present)===
On February 9, 2022, St. Louis was named as interim head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, following the firing of Dominique Ducharme. The Canadiens&#x27; new general manager, Kent Hughes, had first become acquainted with St. Louis while the latter was playing for the University of Vermont, while Gorton, who had previously offered St. Louis a coaching role in the AHL, was now the Canadiens&#x27; executive vice president. They recruited him to assist the team in the midst of a historically poor 8–30–7 start to the 2021–22 season. St. Louis&#x27; lack of professional coaching experience attracted media comment, to which he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not coming in as a substitute teacher. I&#x27;m coming here to show my work and we&#x27;ll see what happens this summer, but my intention is to stay here for a long time. But I&#x27;ll need to show and prove it.&quot; Arriving when team morale was low, St. Louis was credited with boosting competitiveness through narrow losses in his first three games before recording his first NHL win as a coach on February 17 in a 3–2 victory over the St. Louis Blues. In his first visit to Tampa Bay as a coach, the Canadiens won their first game at Amalie Arena since 2017. He finished his first half-season as a coach with a 14–19–4 record. St. Louis was widely credited with huge improvement in the performance of Cole Caufield, a rookie often compared to St. Louis himself as a shorter than average forward.

St. Louis was then named permanent head coach of the Canadiens on June 1, 2022, signing a three-year extension with the team. On April 17, 2024, the Canadiens exercised a two-year option on St. Louis&#x27; contract, effectively making his tenure as head coach until at least the conclusion of the 2026–27 season.

During the course of the 2024–25 season, St. Louis would register his 100th career coaching win on February 4, 2025.

==Playing style==

Listed at five-foot-eight inches tall during his playing days, St. Louis found himself to be one of the smallest players in the NHL. Hockey Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman credited St. Louis&#x27; desire to succeed as being his primary attribute: &quot;His long suit is his passion. Small players have to have some special attribute that makes them stand out. He&#x27;s got great acceleration and hockey sense.&quot; St. Louis was also a durable player throughout his career, missing only seven games between 2002 and 2012.

An offensive minded player throughout his amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis was forced into a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames. He credits the experience for rounding out his game: &quot;I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team&#x27;s top lines. For me, it was like a five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. My whole life, I had been an offensive player, and suddenly I was in the role of trying to be smart without the puck. I think those fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player.&quot;

==Personal life==
St. Louis met his wife Heather Anne Caragol at the University of Vermont, where he graduated in 1997 with a degree in small business management. They have three sons. The family maintains an off-season home in Heather&#x27;s native Greenwich, Connecticut.

St. Louis runs an annual summer hockey camp in the nearby community of Stamford for young players in the region.

On January 8, 2016, the Vermont Catamounts held Martin St. Louis Night, which resulted in a 1–0 victory over visiting Dartmouth. During the night, St. Louis&#x27; number 8 was retired by the program during a pre-game ceremony. This was the first time in program history that the team retired the jersey of a former player. Additionally, senior Jonathan Turk handed St. Louis his number 8 jersey prior to the game. Turk wore the number 88 for the rest of the season.

On October 6, 2016, the Lightning announced that they would retire St. Louis&#x27; number 26. St. Louis became the first player in the history of the Lightning organization to have his jersey retired. The ceremony occurred on January 13, 2017, when the Lightning hosted the Columbus Blue Jackets at Amalie Arena.

On March 17, 2023, St. Louis was inducted into the Tampa Bay Lightning Hall of Fame, as a member of its inaugural class.

<text>Renée Marcelle &quot;Zizi&quot; Jeanmaire (29 April 1924 – 17 July 2020) was a French ballet dancer, actress and singer. She became famous in the 1950s after playing the title role in the ballet &quot;Carmen&quot;, produced in London in 1949, and went on to appear in several Hollywood films and Paris revues. She was the wife of dancer and choreographer Roland Petit, who created ballets and revues for her.

==Career==
Jeanmaire was born in Paris to Olga Renée (&quot;née&quot; Brunus) and Marcel Jeanmaire. She later wrote in her autobiography: &quot;When I was little my mother called me &#x27;mon Jésus&#x27; which transformed into &#x27;mon Zizi&#x27;.&quot;

She met her future husband and long-time collaborator Roland Petit at the Paris Opera Ballet when they were both aged nine. She danced in 1944 in the &quot;Soirées de la danse&quot; at the Theater Sarah Bernhardt. She became a ballerina of the Nouveau Ballet de Monte Carlo in 1946, and danced during the last season of Colonel de Basil&#x27;s Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in London in 1947. In 1949, she became the star of the &quot;Ballets de Paris&quot; directed by Petit, where she was known for her energy and passion. She created her most famous role, Carmen, to a musical arrangement of Bizet&#x27;s opera. For the role, she had her hair cut to boyish shortness, which was copied by many women. The ballet was premiered in London at the Prince&#x27;s Theatre on 21 February 1949, and the obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted: &quot;Nothing as sensual as the duets that Petit created for the lovers had been seen on the London stage before.&quot; The performance was taken to an extended tour on Broadway, repeated the following season.

Jeanmaire first appeared as a chanson singer in Petit&#x27;s &quot;Croqueuse de Diamants&quot; in 1950. A chanson, composed by Raymond Cheneau, won a Grand Prix du disque. In Hollywood, she appeared in the musical film &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; in 1952, with Danny Kaye and Farley Granger. In 1954, she starred on Broadway again, in the musical &quot;The Girl in Pink Tights&quot;. She returned to Paris and married Petit that year. Their daughter Valentine was born the following year, and would become a dancer and actress.

Jeanmaire appeared in film again in 1956, in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Anything Goes&quot; with Bing Crosby, but otherwise focused on dance, including Petit&#x27;s &quot;La Rose des vents&quot; in 1958 and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; in 1959. Beginning in 1961, she made a career in revues at the Alhambra Theatre, with hits such as &quot;Mon truc en plumes&quot;. She performed the song in a dress by Yves Saint Laurent, who became her chief designer for stage and private clothes, and a friend. The number, with twelve young men carrying pink feather fans, became a signature tune and was repeated in other revues by Petit, who produced more than 60 shows with her.

Her fame garnered her press attention, and she preferred seating at fashion shows, for example in a Yves Saint Laurent show in 1967, next to Elsa Martinelli, Françoise Hardy and Catherine Deneuve. Almost 50 years later, &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine viewed Jeanmaire and her peers as representing a guidepost of fashion week celebrity culture.

Jeanmaire died in Switzerland on 17 July 2020.

<text>The 1918 United Kingdom general election was called immediately after the Armistice with Germany which ended the First World War, and was held on Saturday, 14 December 1918. The governing coalition, under Prime Minister David Lloyd George, sent letters of endorsement to candidates who supported the coalition government. These were nicknamed &quot;Coalition Coupons&quot;, and led to the election being known as the &quot;coupon election&quot;. The result was a massive landslide in favour of the coalition, comprising primarily the Conservatives and Coalition Liberals, with massive losses for Liberals who were not endorsed. Nearly all the Liberal MPs without coupons were defeated, including party leader H. H. Asquith.

It was the first general election to include on a single day all eligible voters of the United Kingdom, although the vote count was delayed until 28 December so that the ballots cast by soldiers serving overseas could be included in the tallies.

It resulted in a landslide victory for the coalition government of David Lloyd George, who had replaced H. H. Asquith as Prime Minister in December 1916. They were both Liberals, and continued to battle for control of the party, which was rapidly losing popular support, and never regained power.

It was the first general election to be held after enactment of the Representation of the People Act 1918. It was thus the first election in which women over the age of 30 (with some property qualifications), and all men over the age of 21, could vote. Previously, all women and many poor men had been excluded from voting. Women generally supported the coalition candidates.

It was the first parliamentary election in which women were able to stand as candidates, following the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918, believed to be one of the shortest Acts of Parliament ever given Royal Assent. The Act was passed shortly before Parliament was dissolved. It followed a report by Law Officers that the Great Reform Act 1832 had specified parliamentary candidates had to be male, and that the Representation of the People Act passed earlier in the year did not change that. One woman, Nina Boyle, had already presented herself for a by-election earlier in the year in Keighley, but had been turned down by the returning officer on technical grounds.

Prior to this election the university constituency seats were re-allocated. Several seats were filled in multi-seat constituencies using STV.

The election was also noted for the dramatic result in Ireland, which showed clear disapproval of government policy. The Irish Parliamentary Party were almost completely wiped out by the Irish republican party Sinn Féin, who vowed in their manifesto to establish an independent Irish Republic. They refused to take their seats in Westminster, instead forming a breakaway government and declaring Irish independence. The Irish War of Independence began soon after the election. Because of the resulting partition of Ireland, this was the last United Kingdom general election to include the entire island of Ireland.

==Background==
Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government was supported by a minority (majority after the election) of the Liberals and Bonar Law&#x27;s Conservatives. However, the election saw a split in the Liberal Party between those who were aligned with Lloyd George and the government and those who were aligned with Asquith, the party&#x27;s official leader.

On 14 November it was announced that Parliament, which had been sitting since 1910 and had been extended by emergency wartime action, would dissolve on 25 November, with elections on 14 December.

Following confidential negotiations over the summer of 1918, it was agreed that certain candidates were to be offered the support of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservative Party at the next general election. To these candidates a letter, known as the Coalition Coupon, was sent, indicating the government&#x27;s endorsement of their candidacy. 159 Liberal, 364 Conservative, 20 National Democratic and Labour, and 2 Coalition Labour candidates received the coupon. For this reason, the election is often called the Coupon Election.

80 Conservative candidates stood without a coupon. Of these, 35 candidates were Irish Unionists. Of the other non-couponed Conservative candidates, only 23 stood against a Coalition candidate; the remaining 22 candidates stood in areas where there were no coupons, or refused the offer of a coupon.

The Labour Party, led by William Adamson, fought the election independently, as did those Liberals who did not receive a coupon.

The election was not chiefly fought over what peace to make with Germany, although those issues played a role. More important was the voters&#x27; evaluation of Lloyd George in terms of what he had accomplished so far and what he promised for the future. His supporters emphasised that he had won the Great War. Against his strong record in social legislation, he called for making &quot;a country fit for heroes to live in&quot;.

This election was also known as a khaki election, due to the immediate postwar setting and the role of the demobilised soldiers.

==Coalition victory==
The coalition won the election easily, with the Conservatives the big winners. They were the largest party in the governing majority. Lloyd George remained Prime Minister, despite the Conservatives outnumbering his pro-coalition Liberals and having a majority in their own right. The Conservatives welcomed his leadership on foreign policy as the Paris Peace talks began a few weeks after the election.

An additional 47 Conservatives, 23 of whom were Irish Unionists, won without the coupon but did not act as a separate block or oppose the government except on the issue of Irish independence.

While most of the pro-coalition Liberals were re-elected, the Independent Liberal faction was reduced to a handful of MPs, not all of whom were opponents of the coalition. Asquith and the other leaders lost their seats, and only three with junior ministerial experience were elected. According to Trevor Wilson&#x27;s book, &quot;The Downfall of the Liberal Party&quot;, 136 couponed Liberals were elected, whereas only 29 who did not receive the coupon were returned to Parliament, but as 8 Independent Liberals received the coupon and 10 Lloyd George Liberals did not, the actual number of the Asquith faction was 27. Another historian puts the Asquith faction at 36 seats, of whom nine of these MPs subsequently joined the Coalition Liberal group. The remainder became bitter enemies of Lloyd George. Asquith&#x27;s biographer Stephen Koss accepts that, although accounts differ as to the exact numbers, around 29 uncouponed Liberals had been elected. On 3 February 1919, 23 non-coalition Liberals formed themselves into a &quot;Free Liberal&quot; group (soon known as the &quot;Wee Frees&quot; after a Scottish religious sect of that name); they accepted Asquith&#x27;s appointment of Sir Donald Maclean as chairman in his absence. After a brief attempt to set up a joint committee with the Coalition Liberal MPs, the &quot;Wee Frees&quot; resigned the government whip on 4 April, although some Liberal MPs still remained of uncertain allegiance. Maclean served as Leader of the Opposition until Asquith returned at a by-election in February 1920.

The Labour Party greatly increased its vote share and surpassed the total votes of either faction of the Liberal party, but they lacked an official leader. Labour could only slightly increase their number of seats, however, from 42 to 57 and some of their earlier leaders including Ramsay MacDonald and Arthur Henderson lost their seats. Labour won the most seats in Wales (which had previously been dominated by the Liberals) for the first time, a feat it has continued to the present day.

The Conservative MPs included record numbers of corporate directors, bankers and businessmen, while Labour MPs were mostly from the working class. Bonar Law himself symbolised the change in the type of a Conservative MP as he was a Presbyterian Canadian-born Scottish businessman who became, in the words of his biographer Robert Blake, the leader of &quot;the Party of Old England, the Party of the Anglican Church and the country squire, the party of broad acres and hereditary titles&quot;. Bonar Law&#x27;s ascent as leader of the Conservatives marked a shift in Conservative leaders from the aristocrats who generally led the party in the 19th century to a more middle class leadership who usually led the party in the 20th century. 

Many young veterans reacted against the harsh tone of the campaign and became disillusioned with politics.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, the Irish Parliamentary Party, which favoured Home Rule within the United Kingdom, lost almost all their seats, most of which were won by Sinn Féin under Éamon de Valera, which called for independence. The executions of many of the leaders of the Easter uprising of 1916, the force-feeding of those imprisoned in connection with the uprising who had gone on a hunger strike in 1917, and the Conscription Crisis of 1918 all served to alienate Irish Catholic opinion from the United Kingdom. The Sinn Féin candidates had promised on the campaign trail to win an Irish republic &quot;by any means necessary&quot;, which was a code-word for violence, though it is not entirely clear if all Irish voters understood what the phrase meant. The 73 Sinn Féin elected members declined to take their seats in the British House of Commons, sitting instead in the Irish revolutionary assembly, the Dáil Éireann. On 17 May 1918 almost the entire leadership of Sinn Féin, including de Valera and Arthur Griffith, had been arrested. In total 47 of the Sinn Féin MPs were elected from jail. The Dáil first convened on 21 January 1919, which marks the beginning of the Irish War of Independence.

In the six Ulster counties that became Northern Ireland, Unionists consolidated their position by winning 23 out of the 30 seats. Cardinal Michael Logue brokered a pact in eight seats (one, East Donegal, not in the six counties), after nominations closed, where Catholic voters were instructed to vote for one particular nationalist party. Split evenly, the Irish Parliamentary Party won four of those seats and Sinn Féin three. (The pact failed in East Down). Joseph Devlin, memorably, also won Belfast (Falls) for the Irish Parliamentary Party in a straight fight with Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin.

Constance Markievicz became the first woman elected to Parliament and also to the Dáil Éireann. She was a Sinn Féin member elected for Dublin St Patrick&#x27;s, and like the other Sinn Féin MPs, did not take her seat at Westminster.

Over the course of his career, he made five NHL All-Star Game appearances and played in three consecutive Stanley Cup Finals with three different teams, finally winning the Stanley Cup in 2009–10 with Chicago. He won two additional Stanley Cup championships with Chicago during the 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons. Hossa&#x27;s playing career ended prematurely in 2017, when he announced he was suffering from a progressive skin disorder. His contract was traded to the Arizona Coyotes in 2018 and he formally retired in 2022. Hossa accumulated 525 goals and 609 assists for 1,134 points in 1,309 regular-season games over his 19-year NHL career. He was the 44th player in NHL history to score 500 goals, and the 80th player to score 1,000 points. He was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Hossa played in the 1993 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Bratislava.

===Ottawa Senators (1998–2004)===
Hossa was drafted in the first round, 12th overall, by the Ottawa Senators in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft from Dukla Trenčín of the Slovak Extraliga. Shortly thereafter, he was selected fifth overall in the 1997 Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Import Draft by the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL), acquiring his major junior rights in the event that he did not immediately stick with the Senators in the NHL.

After seven games in the NHL, the Senators assigned Hossa to junior, where he tallied 45 goals and 40 assists for 85 points in 53 games with the Winterhawks in 1997–98, earning him the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as WHL rookie of the year, as well as CHL and WHL West First Team All-Star honors. He led the Winterhawks to a President&#x27;s Cup as WHL champions en route to the 1998 Memorial Cup championship. Late in the third period of a tied championship game against the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)&#x27;s Guelph Storm, Hossa collided with Guelph forward Ryan Davis and suffered a serious knee injury, forcing him out of the game. The Winterhawks went on to clinch the championship in overtime and Hossa returned to the ice on a chair as his teammates pushed him around with the Memorial Cup to celebrate the victory. With seven points in four tournament games, Hossa was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star team, along with teammate Andrej Podkonický.

The injury kept Hossa from joining the Senators for his rookie season in 1998–99 until December. Despite missing two months, Hossa managed 15 goals and 15 assists for 30 points in 60 games to earn NHL All-Rookie honours and finish second to the Colorado Avalanche&#x27;s Chris Drury in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for rookie of the year.

The following year, in 1999–2000, Hossa improved to 29 goals and 56 points. However, late in the season, on 11 March 2000, he was responsible for an on-ice accident in which he high-sticked Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Bryan Berard on the follow-through of an attempted shot. The resulting one-inch laceration nearly forced doctors to remove the eye and nearly ended Berard&#x27;s playing career. Deeply regretful and concerned, Hossa went to visit Berard in hospital the next day to offer an apology to which Berard absolved him of any responsibility.

Hossa recorded 32 goals and 75 points in 2000–01, finishing second in team scoring behind Alexei Yashin and earning his first NHL All-Star Game appearance in Denver.

In the subsequent off-season, his rookie contract expired and Hossa became a restricted free agent. Unable to come to terms before training camp for the 2001–02 season, Hossa sat out the first two weeks before signing a three-year, $8.5 million contract on 26 September 2001. Despite Hossa&#x27;s lucrative new contract, his production would dip to 66 points in the first year of the deal.

Hossa would regain form in 2002–03 with a career-high 45 goals, 35 assists and a team-leading 80 points, while competing in the 2003 NHL All-Star Game in Sunrise, Florida. He then led the Senators to a long playoff run where they were ultimately eliminated in seven games by the eventual Stanley Cup-champion New Jersey Devils in the Eastern Conference Finals. Hossa led the Senators with 16 points in 18 post-season games.

The following season, he led the Senators in scoring for the second consecutive season with a personal best 82 points, then added four points in seven games in the playoffs as the Senators were eliminated by the Maple Leafs in the first round.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Hossa spent the 2004–05 season playing in Europe. Beginning the season in Slovakia, he joined Mora IK of the Swedish Elitserien to play with his younger brother Marcel after 19 games with former club Dukla Trenčín. After 32 points in 24 games with Mora IK, Hossa returned to Dukla Trenčín, where he completed the season for a total of 42 points in 22 games with the team.

===Atlanta Thrashers (2005–2008)===

With NHL play set to resume the following season in 2005–06 and Hossa&#x27;s previous contract expired, he signed a three-year, $18-million deal with the Senators. However, the contract only precipitated a deal that sent him that same day to the Atlanta Thrashers along with defenseman Greg de Vries for all star forward Dany Heatley, who had requested a trade following the death of teammate Dan Snyder in a car crash for which Heatley was ruled responsible. Hossa joined star winger Ilya Kovalchuk and scored 39 goals and 53 assists for 92 points, surpassing his previous personal best by ten points, in his first season with the Thrashers.

In the 2006–07 season, Hossa made franchise history as the first Thrasher to score 100 points in one season, finishing with 43 goals and 57 assists; along with a plus/minus rating of +18. He was named to his third All-Star Game in Dallas where he notched four assists. In the final game of the regular season, Hossa recorded two assists against the Tampa Bay Lightning to achieve the 100-point mark, which still stands as the franchise&#x27;s single-season points record. The season also marked the first division title and post-season appearance for the Thrashers, clinching the Southeast Division title for the third playoff seed. Hossa, however, only managed one point in four games as the Thrashers were eliminated in the first round by the New York Rangers.

===Pittsburgh Penguins (2008)===

In the last year of his contract with the Thrashers in 2007–08, the team and Hossa could not agree on an extension, Hossa was acquired by the Pittsburgh Penguins at the trade deadline on 26 February 2008, along with Pascal Dupuis, in exchange for Colby Armstrong, Erik Christensen, prospect Angelo Esposito and the Penguins&#x27; first-round pick in 2008 (Daultan Leveille). In his Penguins debut two days later, Hossa injured his medial collateral ligament (MCL) in a knee-on-knee collision with Glen Murray of the Boston Bruins. Hossa missed the next six contests before rejoining the team for the conclusion of the regular season, playing on a line with Dupuis and captain Sidney Crosby. Hossa completed the regular season with 66 points in 72 games split between the Thrashers and Penguins. He had also appeared in his fourth All-Star Game while still with the Thrashers as the host-city.

Complementing an already high-powered offence led by Evgeni Malkin and Crosby, Hossa proved to be a vital cog in the Penguins&#x27; run to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals. He scored his first playoff overtime goal in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, his second of the contest, against Henrik Lundqvist to clinch the series, putting the Penguins into the Conference Finals against the Philadelphia Flyers. Eliminating the Flyers in five games, Hossa and the Penguins met the Detroit Red Wings in the Final. After scoring the opening goal in game five to help stave off elimination in a triple-overtime victory, Hossa scored his team-leading 12th and final post-season goal in the sixth and deciding game to pull the Penguins within one goal. However, the Penguins were ultimately defeated by the Red Wings 3–2. Hossa nearly forced overtime with the tying goal, but was stopped by goaltender Chris Osgood in the final seconds of the game. He finished third in playoff scoring with 26 points, behind Conn Smythe Trophy-winner Henrik Zetterberg of the Red Wings and linemate Sidney Crosby. Hossa&#x27;s performance helped shed a reputation for post-season underachievement, as indicated by previous playoff dry spells with the Senators and Thrashers.

===Detroit Red Wings (2008–2009)===

Despite a reported five-year contract offer worth $7 million annually from the Penguins in attempts to retain his services, on 1 July 2008, Hossa signed a one-year deal with the Detroit Red Wings worth $7.45 million. Hossa had also reportedly turned down a multi-year offer from the Edmonton Oilers worth at least $9 million per season. Hossa explained that he opted for the shorter-term contract in hopes of a better opportunity to win a Stanley Cup with the Red Wings. With Red Wings&#x27; veteran forward Kirk Maltby already wearing Hossa&#x27;s number 18, Hossa switched to 81 with Detroit. Hossa notched his first goal as a Red Wing on 18 October, an overtime winner against the New York Rangers, which also marked the 300th goal of his career. Hossa scored a goal in his return to Pittsburgh with the Red Wings on 8 February, where he was heavily booed by the Pittsburgh fans.

After missing two games due to a neck injury late in the season, Hossa was taken off the ice in a stretcher after falling head first into the boards following a check from St. Louis Blues defenceman Roman Polák on 3 March 2009. Escaping serious injury after having laid motionless on the ice for several minutes, it was revealed that in addition to minor neck complications, Hossa also suffered a bruised knee and was listed as day-to-day. Despite the injury, Hossa returned to finish the season with a team-leading 40 goals for his third career 40-goal season.

Late in the season, on 23 March 2009, Hossa was quoted as saying he would like to sign a long-term contract with the Red Wings for the upcoming season. He also stated he is willing to take less money to continue to play for Detroit, saying, &quot;I know if I go somewhere else, I could have more, but I&#x27;m willing to take less to stay here. Hopefully things work out.&quot; Hossa&#x27;s comments came just several months after the Red Wings signed forward Henrik Zetterberg to a 12-year contract extension.

As the Red Wings attempted to defend their 2008 Stanley Cup championship, Hossa met his former team, the Pittsburgh Penguins, as the two clubs met for the second straight year in the Final. The prospect of Hossa losing to the team he left in order to secure a Stanley Cup championship received considerable media attention. Prior to eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in the Western Conference Finals, Hossa admitted meeting the Penguins in the finals &quot;would definitely be very interesting.&quot; Ultimately, Hossa did, in fact, lose to his former team, falling by a 2–1 score in the seventh game. Immediately following the game, Hossa was asked whether he regretted his decision to leave the Penguins, to which he replied, &quot;Regret? I don&#x27;t regret it. It could be different circumstances if I sign in Pittsburgh, they probably couldn&#x27;t sign some other players and they&#x27;d be a different team.&quot; Hossa finished the 2009 playoffs with six goals and nine assists for a total of 15 points over 23 games.

===Chicago Blackhawks (2009–2017)===

On 1 July 2009, Hossa signed a 12-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks worth $62.8 million. The contract was front-loaded with $59.3 million due in the first eight years for an average cap hit of $5.2 million per season. It was also the most lucrative deal in team history until defenceman Duncan Keith signed a 13-year, $72 million contract several months later in December 2009. The signing of Hossa by the Blackhawks coincided with the departure of the team&#x27;s leading scorer and MVP from the previous season and former Ottawa Senators teammate, Martin Havlát, to the Minnesota Wild that same day. Shortly after signing Hossa, the team disclosed that the veteran forward was still rehabilitating a shoulder injury he sustained during the previous post-season. The injury required Hossa to undergo surgery, and caused him to miss the first eight weeks of the season. Hossa wore the no. 81 uniform for the Blackhawks, becoming the first and only player in the franchise&#x27;s history to do so.

Hossa&#x27;s contract negotiations became the subject of controversy in early August. On 31 July, the &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot; originally reported that the NHL launched an investigation on Hossa&#x27;s long-term deal. Because the contract is front-loaded and expires by the time Hossa is 42, it was speculated whether retirement before expiry of the contract was part of the Blackhawks&#x27; negotiations. Such an agreement would be considered by the NHL to be a circumvention of the salary cap and the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which would be subject to fines or the loss of draft picks. Even though the NHL did not fine or punish the Blackhawks, they later introduced a new rule preventing teams from front-loading contracts as lucratively as the Blackhawks did with Hossa.

After missing the first 22 games of the 2009–10 season, Hossa made his debut for the Blackhawks on 25 November 2009, against the San Jose Sharks, scoring twice, including a short-handed goal in the second period of the game.

During the Blackhawks&#x27; first playoff series in 2010, Hossa received a five-minute major penalty for boarding Nashville Predators defenceman Dan Hamhuis. With 13.6 seconds left in regulation, Hossa&#x27;s teammate Patrick Kane tied the game. In the ensuing overtime, Hossa scored the game-winning goal on Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne seconds after exiting the penalty box. Since Hamhuis was not injured, the NHL did not fine or suspend Hossa. On 23 May 2010, the Chicago Blackhawks swept the top seeded San Jose Sharks to earn a trip to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, sending Hossa to the Final for the third-straight year with his third different team, a first in the NHL. Fans and the media had dubbed Hossa&#x27;s inability to win the Stanley Cup while going to the finals the &quot;Hossa Curse&quot; or the &quot;Hossa Hex.&quot; According to Hossa&#x27;s agent, Ritch Winter, Hossa&#x27;s third consecutive year in the Stanley Cup Finals was no coincidence, with Winter stating that they had used a mathematical model to determine the teams most likely to get at least 100 points in the 2009–10 regular season. On 9 June 2010, Hossa finally lifted his first Stanley Cup after the Blackhawks defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in six games. Chicago captain Jonathan Toews handed the Cup to Hossa first during the team pass-around. Hossa was the first player in NHL history to go to the Finals in three consecutive seasons with three different teams, a feat that would subsequently be repeated by Corey Perry in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

In 2011–12, Hossa was picked eighth overall by Team Chara in the second annual All-Star Fantasy Draft for the 2012 All-Star Game. In the game, Hossa scored one goal and two assists in a 12–9 win against Team Alfredsson. On 20 March 2012, Hossa scored his 900th NHL career point (417 goals and 483 assists) in his 970th game played via a goal scored against the Columbus Blue Jackets. In the first period of Game 3 of the opening round of the 2012 Western Conference Quarterfinals, he was taken off the ice on a stretcher and briefly hospitalized after being hit by the Phoenix Coyotes&#x27;s Raffi Torres. Torres was suspended 25 games by the NHL for the hit, though it was later reduced to 21 games after an NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) appeal.

Hossa recovered in time for the start of the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season. He played 40 games and recorded 17 goals and 14 assists in the 48-game season, finishing third on the team with 31 points and helping the Blackhawks win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions. During the season, he also played in his 1,000th career game on 3 March 2013, en route to a 2–1 win over his former team, the Detroit Red Wings. Hossa then scored seven goals and nine assists for 16 points in 22 games in the 2013 playoffs as the Blackhawks eventually defeated the Boston Bruins to win the Stanley Cup in the Finals. Hossa&#x27;s trip to the Finals marked his fourth appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals in the past six seasons.
On 30 October 2014, shortly into the 2014–15 season, Hossa scored his 1,000th career point with a goal against the Ottawa Senators, becoming the 80th player in NHL history to reach the milestone. On 15 June 2015, Hossa and the Blackhawks won the Cup for the third time in six seasons after Chicago&#x27;s victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Finals.

Hossa approached off-season training differently prior to the 2016–17 season. He performed more cardio-intensive workouts to improve his stamina and conditioning. On 18 October 2016, Hossa scored his 500th career NHL goal, which came in a 7–4 Blackhawks win over the visiting Philadelphia Flyers. Hossa became the second NHL player born in Slovakia to score that many (Stan Mikita), and the fifth player to score his 500th with the Blackhawks; Bobby Hull; Michel Goulet; Peter Bondra. Hossa rebounded in 2016–17 by scoring 26 goals and 19 assists for 45 points in 73 contests played.

===Retirement=== 
Before the start of 2017–18 season, the Blackhawks revealed that Hossa was suffering from a progressive skin disorder called eczema and would miss the entire 2017–18 season while undergoing treatment. The Blackhawks officially placed Hossa on long-term injured reserve on 4 October 2017. In May 2018, Hossa announced he could no longer play professional hockey due to complications from his skin disorder. Hossa stated that if it was not for his condition, he felt that he could have still played a few more years.

The Chicago Blackhawks traded Hossa&#x27;s contract, along with forward Vinnie Hinostroza, defenseman Jordan Oesterle, and third-round draft pick in the 2019 NHL Draft to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for Marcus Kruger, MacKenzie Entwistle, Jordan Maletta, Andrew Campbell, and fifth-round draft pick in the 2019 NHL Draft.

On 24 June 2020, Hossa was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is the third Slovak-born player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame following Stan Mikita and Peter Šťastný. Hossa was only the second player to go to the Hall of Fame while still under contract, joining Chris Pronger, who was injured and under contract by Arizona when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2015.

Hossa expressed interest in returning to the Blackhawks organization after his contract expires. When asked about the reunion during an October 2019 interview, he commented, &quot;I would love to, so we’ll see what happen after my contract is done, but definitely there’s lots of love for me for Chicago and great people I got a chance to work with. So definitely that would be something I would look forward to and we&#x27;re gonna have a good talk and we&#x27;ll see what&#x27;s gonna happen.&quot;

Hossa signed a ceremonial one-day contract on 7 April 2022 to officially retire as a Blackhawk. The Blackhawks retired Hossa&#x27;s no. 81 on 20 November 2022.

Hossa played in one final fundraiser game with many of his former teammates and friends including, Daniel Alfredsson, Duncan Keith, Zdeno Chára, Jonathan Toews, Marcus Krüger, Tomáš Kopecký, Viktor Stålberg, Niklas Hjalmarsson and Nicklas Lidström, on 18 August 2023 in Hossa&#x27;s hometown, Trenčín.

== International play ==
Early in his career, Hossa represented Slovakia in two World Junior Championships, in 1997 and 1998. Also appearing in his first World Championships in 1997, tallying two points as an 18-year-old, Hossa has made seven appearances in the tournament throughout his career. Despite personal World Championship best seven-point performances in 1999, 2004, 2005 and 2006, Hossa has remained medal-less with the Slovak men&#x27;s team.

Hossa made his Olympics debut at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, tallying six points in only two games for Slovakia. In the subsequent 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Hossa accumulated ten points in six games, but Slovakia was kept from the podium. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Hossa scored the game-tying goal in the third period against Russia during the preliminary round. In the bronze medal game, Hossa scored a goal and an assist while versing Finland. Slovakia lost to Finland 3–5, and ended up placing 4th overall in the Olympics.

Hossa also competed for Slovakia at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, held prior to the NHL lockout, but managed just one goal in four games. During the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Hossa played for Mora IK, a professional ice hockey team in Sweden.

Hossa also played for Slovakia in the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi. Though Slovakia lost all four games, Hossa ended up scoring two goals and an assist.

In 2016 it was announced that Hossa would play for Team Europe at the World Cup of Hockey.

==Personal life==
Hossa was born in Stará Ľubovňa, Czechoslovakia, to František Hossa, who was a professional hockey player, and Mária Hossová, a clothing designer. Hossa&#x27;s brother who is two years younger than him, Marcel Hossa, was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens 16th overall in the first round in the 2000 NHL draft. Following in his footsteps playing for both of Marián&#x27;s previous junior teams, Dukla Trenčín and the Portland Winter Hawks. Both of the Hossas have played together for Mora IK of the Elitserien during the 2004–05 NHL lockout and on the Slovak national team in the World Championships and Winter Olympics. Coincidentally, they were both dealt by their NHL teams on the day of the 2007–08 trade deadline — Marián from Atlanta to Pittsburgh and Marcel from the New York Rangers to the Phoenix Coyotes. The younger Hossa is no longer playing professional hockey. His last season was in 2017–18, where he played with HK Dukla Trencin. Hossa also grew up with Marián Gáborík and Zdeno Chára in Trenčín, and remained close friends with them through his NHL career. Trenčín honored the trio by naming three streets after each skater in 2015. Marián&#x27;s father was head coach of the Slovak national team and coached his sons in several tournaments.

In July 2010, Hossa married his long-time girlfriend in his hometown Trenčín, Slovakia. They have three daughters.

Hossa also owns his own company called Hoss Corp located in Trenčín, Slovakia. His company includes a non-profit organization, a sports complex, and apartment complexes that are coming soon. Hoss Heros, which is the non-profit organization, assembles charities and aims to improve the community especially in young athletes. The Hoss Sports Center offers a wide variety of activities where families could come to enjoy their day. This complex includes a 9-hole golf course, tennis courts, and a beach area where beach volleyball and team building events are held. The apartments that are currently being planned out are going to draw more people into the city. It will have its own area code as well.

Hossa&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Marián Hossa: My Journey from Trencín to the Hall of Fame&quot;, was released in November 2022.
