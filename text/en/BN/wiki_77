<text>The Westland WS-61 Sea King is a British licence-built version of the American Sikorsky S-61 helicopter of the same name, built by Westland Helicopters. The aircraft differs considerably from the American version, with Rolls-Royce Gnome engines (derived from the US General Electric T58), British-made anti-submarine warfare systems and a fully computerised flight control system. The Sea King was primarily designed for performing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. A Sea King variant known as the Commando was developed by Westland to serve as a troop transport.

In British service, the Westland Sea King provided a wide range of services in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. As well as wartime roles in the Falklands War, the Gulf War, the Bosnian War, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War, it was used as a Royal Navy Search and Rescue (red and grey livery) and RAF Search and Rescue Force (yellow livery) helicopter. The Sea King was also adapted to meet the Royal Navy&#x27;s requirement for a ship-based airborne early warning platform.

On 26 September 2018, the last remaining Sea King variant in Royal Navy service was retired. Many operators have replaced, or are planning to replace, the Sea King with new helicopters, such as the NHIndustries NH90, SH-60 Seahawk, and the AgustaWestland AW101. Germany retired the type in March 2024; however, it is still in widespread service around the globe, including India and several Middle Eastern countries.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
Westland Helicopters, which had a long-standing licence agreement with Sikorsky Aircraft to allow it to build Sikorsky&#x27;s helicopters, extended the agreement to cover the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King soon after the Sea King&#x27;s first flight in 1959. Westland proceeded to independently develop the Sea King, integrating a significant proportion of components from British suppliers; key changes include the use of a pair of Rolls-Royce Gnome turboshaft engines and the implementation of an automatic flight control system. On this matter, authors Jim Thorn and Gerald Frawley stated that: &quot;Despite appearances, Westland&#x27;s Sea King [is a] very different aircraft from Sikorsky&#x27;s&quot;. Many of the differences between the Westland-built Sea King and the original helicopter were as a result of differing operational doctrine. While the U.S. Navy Sea Kings were intended to be under tactical control of the carrier from which they operated, the Royal Navy intended its helicopters to be much more autonomous, capable of operating alone, or co-ordinating with other aircraft or surface vessels. This resulted in a different crew arrangement, with operations being controlled by an observer rather than the pilot, as well as fitting a search radar.

The Royal Navy selected the Sea King to meet a requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex, placing an order with Westland for 60 SH-3D Sea Kings in June 1966. The prototype and three pre-production aircraft were built by Sikorsky at Stratford, Connecticut and shipped to the United Kingdom to act as trials and pattern aircraft. The first of the SH-3Ds was initially fitted with General Electric T58s and, after being shipped from the United States, was flown in October 1966 from the dockside at Avonmouth to Yeovil airfield. The other three were delivered from the docks, by road to Yeovil, for completion with British systems and Rolls-Royce Gnome engines. The first Westland-built helicopter, designated Sea King HAS1, flew on 7 May 1969 at Yeovil. The first two helicopters were used for trials and evaluation by Westland and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment; subsequent production Sea Kings were delivered to the Royal Navy&#x27;s 700 Naval Air Squadron from August 1969 onwards.

By 1979, the Royal Navy had ordered 56 HAS1s and 21 HAS2s to meet the anti-submarine requirements, these were also configured for the secondary anti-ship role. The Westland Sea King was updated and adapted for numerous roles, subsequent variants include the &quot;HAS2&quot;, &quot;HAS5&quot; and &quot;HAS6&quot;. Changes from initial production aircraft included an expansion of the cabin and upgraded engines.

===Commando and further developments===
One of the most extensively modified variants was the Westland Commando, operated by the Royal Navy as the HC4. The Commando had capacity for up to 28 fully equipped troops and had originally been developed to meet an Egyptian Air Force requirement. Due to the deletion of the amphibious capability, not required in the Egyptian desert, the most noticeable change from the Sea King was the deletion of the side floats, the main undercarriage being carried on stub sponsons. An improved variant of the Egyptian Commando, with changes including the fitting of folding blades common to the ASW variants, was designated as the Sea King HC4 by the Royal Navy and all the aircraft were new build. First flying on 26 September 1979, due to its operational range of up to 600 nautical miles without refuelling, the HC4 &#x27;Commando&#x27; became an important asset for amphibious warfare and troop transport duties, in particular. Several Royal Naval Air Squadrons have operated the Commando variant, such as 845 Naval Air Squadron, 846 Naval Air Squadron and 848 Naval Air Squadron. In British service, the Sea King HC4 was deployed on operations in the Falklands, the Balkans, both Gulf Wars, Sierra Leone, Lebanon and Afghanistan. Towards the end of the Sea King&#x27;s operational life, several HAS6s were repurposed by the removal of the ASW equipment, as troop transports. In 2010, the last of the UK&#x27;s converted ASW Sea Kings to troop transports were retired.

In the 1970s, Westland&#x27;s experience with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor. Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well.

Westland has produced a total of 330 Sea Kings; export customers include the Indian Naval Air Arm, the German Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The last of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Kings in the ASW role was retired in 2003, being replaced by the AgustaWestland Merlin HM1. The Sea King Airborne Surveillance and Control (ASaC) variant is expected to be replaced around the introduction of the two aircraft carriers. The UK has also planned to retire the HC4 and search and rescue variants in March 2016.

===Search and rescue===

A dedicated search and rescue (SAR) version, the HAR3, was developed for the RAF Search and Rescue Force. The type entered service in 1978 to replace the Westland Whirlwind HAR.10. A 16th helicopter was ordered shortly after, and following the Falklands War of 1982, three more were purchased to enable operation of a SAR flight in the islands, initially from Navy Point on the north side of Stanley harbour, and later from RAF Mount Pleasant. In 1992, six further helicopters were ordered to replace the last remaining Westland Wessex helicopters in the SAR role, entering service in 1996. However, teething problems resulted in the actual operational use of the HAR3A&#x27;s being delayed until mid 1997. The six Sea King HAR3As featured updated systems, including a digital navigation system and more modern avionics.
Westland also manufactured SAR versions of the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force. On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft&#x27;s sponsons. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.

, up to 12 HAR3/3As were dispersed across the UK, a further two HAR3s were attached to the Falkland Islands, providing 24-hour rescue coverage. Some Royal Navy HAS5 ASW variants were adapted for the SAR role and served with 771 Naval Air Squadron, Culdrose and HMS Gannet SAR Flight at Prestwick Airport in Scotland. They were expected to remain in service until 2016, being replaced with civilian operated SAR rotorcraft. Both Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge have flown SAR Sea Kings in front-line roles.

===Airborne early warning===
The Royal Navy&#x27;s airborne early warning (AEW) capability had been lost when the Fairey Gannet aeroplane was withdrawn after the last of the RN&#x27;s fleet carriers was decommissioned in 1978. During the Falklands War, a number of warships were lost and casualties suffered due to the lack of an AEW platform. The proposed fleet cover by the RAF Shackleton AEW.2 was too unresponsive and at too great a distance to be practical. Consequently, two Sea King HAS2s were modified in 1982 with the addition of the Thorn-EMI ARI 5980/3 Searchwater LAST radar attached to the fuselage on a swivel arm and protected by an inflatable dome. This allowed the radar to be lowered below the fuselage during flight and for it to be raised for landing. These prototypes, designated HAS2(AEW), were both flying within 11 weeks and deployed with 824 &quot;D&quot; Flight on HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, serving in the Falklands after the cessation of hostilities. A further eight HAS2s were modified to a production standard, known as the AEW2. Two remained &quot;fitted for but not with&quot;. These entered operational service in 1985, being deployed by 849 Naval Air Squadron. Three Sea King HAS5/6s were later converted as part of the ASaC Mk7 programme, bringing the Mk7 fleet to 13; still 3 below the requirement.

The upgrade programme resulted in the Sea King AEW fleet being upgraded with a new mission system, Comms, NavAids, JTIDS, Active Noise Reduction and Videographic recording. The Mission System Upgrade (MSU) component (Radar and partial JTIDS integration) was based around the improved Searchwater 2000AEW radar, with an all-new Man-Machine Interface. This MSU component was later termed &quot;Project Cerberus&quot; by Thales, after successful integration was conducted by Westland and GEC-Marconi. This variant was initially referred to as the &quot;Sea King AEW7&quot;, but renamed &quot;ASaC7&quot; (Airborne Surveillance and Control Mk.7) just before In Service Date. The main role of the Sea King ASaC7 is detection of low-flying attack aircraft; it also provides interception/attack control and over-the-horizon targeting for surface-launched weapon systems. In comparison to older versions, the new radar enables the ASaC7 to simultaneously track up to 400 targets, instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets. The effectiveness of the AEW7 was greatly increased via the addition of a Link 16 data link, allowing gathered radar information to be analysed and rapidly put to use by multiple allied platforms in range.

The ASaC7s remained in service until they were replaced under the &quot;Crowsnest&quot; programme; intended as a podded capability onboard Merlins. Previous proposed replacement programmes - Future Organic Airborne Early Warning (FOAEW) and MASC (Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control) - were initiated and then cancelled, due largely to the erroneous assumption that the entire ASaC Mk7 system could simply be lifted and plugged into another aircraft type. However, as a result of the time gap between the planned out of service date of the Sea King in 2016, and the introduction of &quot;Crowsnest&quot;, seven Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters remained in service with the RN through to the second half of 2018.

The last Sea Kings were retired in September 2018, marking almost half a century of service, with the last three taking a ceremonial flight before retirement.

==Operational history==

===United Kingdom===

====Falklands Conflict====
A number of Sea Kings were deployed during the Falklands Conflict. They were transported to the combat zone and operated from the decks of various ships of the Royal Navy, such as the landing platform dock . In the theatre, they performed a wide range of missions, from anti-submarine patrols and reconnaissance flights to replenishment operations and the insertion of special forces. Support provided by the Sea Kings in the form of transport for men and supplies has been viewed as vital to the success of the British operation. Sea Kings also protected the fleet by acting as decoys against incoming Exocet missiles, with some missions being flown by Prince Andrew, Duke of York.

Anti-Submarine Sea Kings of 820 Naval Air Squadron were embarked in . With 11 HAS.5s, the squadron operated anti-submarine and search and rescue sorties with one helicopter always airborne on surface search duties. On 14 June, an 820 NAS Sea King HAS.5 was used to transport Major General Jeremy Moore to Port Stanley to accept the surrender of Argentine troops on the island. The squadron flew 1,650 sorties during the war. &quot;A&quot; Flight of 824 Naval Air Squadron embarked two Sea King HAS.2As aboard and were used to move supplies to other ships on the way south and later anti-submarine patrols. &quot;C&quot; Flight had three Sea King HAS.2As on board which were used for replenishment duties, supplying over 2,000 tons of stores.

825 Naval Air Squadron was formed for the war with 10 Sea King HAS.2s modified as utility variants to support ground forces. The anti-submarine equipment was removed and the helicopters fitted with troop seats. Two aircraft embarked in &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and were later used for moving troops from &quot;QE2&quot; to other ships, the remainder embarked in &quot;Atlantic Causeway&quot; and were used for troop movements around the islands. Embarked in was 826 Naval Air Squadron with nine HAS.5s, which carried out continuous anti-submarine sorties. From the departure of &quot;Hermes&quot; from Ascension in April until the Argentine surrender, the squadron operated at least three helicopters airborne continuously for fleet protection.

On 23 April 1982, a Sea King HC4 was ditched while performing a risky transfer of supplies to a ship at night, operating from the flagship HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;. On 12 May, a Sea King operating from &quot;Hermes&quot; crashed into the sea due to an altimeter problem; all crew were rescued. On 19 May 1982 a Sea King, in the process of transporting SAS troops to from &quot;Hermes&quot;, crashed into the sea while attempting to land on &quot;Intrepid&quot;. Twenty-two men were killed and nine survived. Bird feathers were found in the debris, suggesting a bird strike, although investigations of the cause of the accident proved to be inconclusive. The SAS lost 18 men in the crash, their highest number of casualties on one day since the Second World War. The Royal Signals lost one man and the RAF one man.

====Gulf War====
During the 1991 Gulf War Sea Kings from several nations, including Canada, Britain, and the U.S., were present in the coalition forces against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq regime. Due to the threat of potential use of any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, it was standard practice for Sea King crews to wear fully enclosed NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protective suits. Britain&#x27;s Sea Kings primarily engaged in inter-ship transport duties, including ferrying troops between the fleet and land. Six Sea King Mk4 helicopters from 845 Naval Air Squadron and six of 848 Squadron, which had been reformed to meet this operational demand, worked in support of the ground advance. There was thorough radar coverage by U.S. airborne early warning and control (AWACS) aircraft; British AEW Sea Kings were not deployed.

Following the end of hostilities, the available Sea Kings remained on deployment in the region to conduct transport missions to relocate people displaced by the conflict to refugee camps and repatriate citizens to their home countries.

====Balkans====
The Sea King participated in the UN and NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 845 Naval Air Squadron and their Sea Kings had been dispatched to the region in late 1992 in response to escalating tensions in the region. They performed various logistical and transport missions, such as the repositioning of Royal Artillery L118 Light Guns in the region and in the evacuation of casualties. In one incident on 24 March 1993, during an attempt to establish an air evacuation route to a UN-declared safe zone, a flight of French Aérospatiale Pumas and Sea King HC4 helicopters were shelled while taking off from an improvised landing zone. Two further Sea Kings arrived to evacuate several UN casualties, managing to fly the wounded to the Bosnian city of Tuzla, where they came under further enemy fire while unloading.

During NATO&#x27;s intervention in Kosovo, Sea Kings of 814 Naval Air Squadron, operating from numerous Royal Navy vessels in the Adriatic, including the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, maintained a patrol of the Balkans&#x27; coast. The Sea Kings were also heavily used in the transport role during the preparations for a ground invasion of Kosovo.

====2000s====

In 2000, Sea King HC.4s of 846 NAS participated in Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone.
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, multiple Sea King ASaC7 from 849 NAS were operated from HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. On 22 March 2003, two AEW Sea Kings from 849 NAS operating from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; collided over the Persian Gulf, resulting in the death of seven personnel. A report into the collision called for Sea Kings to be outfitted with night vision goggles, as well as better onboard safety equipment, and recommended changes to procedure regarding the use of radar at night. However, it later transpired that the Board of Inquiry had not been told that the three main contributory factors it reported coincided with the three main areas of degradation between the Mk2 and Mk7. (NVG, Anti-Collision lighting and Interoperability with ships). These had been identified and two contracts let to mitigate the risks had been cancelled by an administrative official. Moreover, in 1994 the RN had rejected the recommendation of the programme manager to retain NVG.

In July 2006, Sea King HC.4 helicopters based at RNAS Yeovilton were temporarily deployed to Cyprus to assist in Operation Highbrow, the evacuation of British citizens from Lebanon.

In October 2011, following several years of service in Afghanistan as troop transports for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) forces stationed there, the Sea King HC.4s returned to the UK; their replacement is the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin. Between April 2009 and July 2011, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Kings stationed at Camp Bastion conducted over 1000 operational missions.

The last Sea King flight in service was in September 2018, marking an end to half a century of service with the Royal Navy.

===Australia===
In 1974, Australia purchased 12 Westland Sea King Mk 50s as the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s new ASW helicopter; the Sea Kings replaced the aircraft carrier &#x27;s complement of Westland Wessex HAS31 in the following year. Early operations were troubled by a series of accidents. Between October 1975 to May 1979, four aircraft were lost in accidents, the primary causes were the loss of oil from the main gearbox.

The Australian Sea Kings had similar avionics to that of the Sea King HAS.1, with the same ARI 5995 search radar in a dorsal radome, but had American Bendix AN/AQS-13A dipping sonar instead of the Plessey sonar of the Royal Navy Sea Kings. They also had more powerful engines giving improved high temperature hover performance. Australia&#x27;s Sea Kings were flown by 817 Squadron RAN from HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; until the carrier was retired from service, without replacement. As the Sea King was too large to operate from the s, 817 Squadron was then forced to operate from land bases, in both ASW and utility roles, with the Sea King relinquishing the anti-submarine mission in 1990.
During the 2003 Iraq War, Sea Kings were heavily used in logistical roles, such as the first delivery of humanitarian aid to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Australian Sea Kings played a major role in disaster relief efforts in Indonesia&#x27;s Aceh province, delivering medical teams and supplies from Royal Australian Navy ships. Prior to retirement, the last major missions were flown during the 2010–11 Queensland floods, in which Sea Kings provided SAR coverage of the region and delivered aid relief to citizens in the flooded areas.

The replacement of the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s Sea King fleet commenced faster than initially planned following the loss of a Sea King during a humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia in April 2005, resulting in nine deaths. Investigators uncovered serious faults in the condition of the Sea King&#x27;s mechanical flight control system, resulting from maintenance deficiencies. In May 2007, the six remaining Sea Kings were grounded for two months following the discovery of a number of missing parts.

On 1 September 2011, the Australian Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, announced that the Sea Kings would be withdrawn from service in December 2011; having flown in excess of 60,000 hours in operations in Australia and overseas in that time. The farewell flight was conducted on 15 December 2011, three Sea Kings flew over Sydney Harbour and across to Canberra, passing Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial before landing at Nowra. On 16 December 2011, the Chief of Navy presided over the ceremonial decommissioning of 817 Squadron RAN at NAS Nowra. Five of the withdrawn helicopters have been made available for sale. The replacement for the Sea King was intended to be the MRH 90. However, in the 2010s issues with that design lead to only six being acquired and the SH-60 Seahawk ended up being the main successor.

===India===

Following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Pakistan invested heavily in modern submarines and long-range torpedoes. In response, India opted to procure six Westland Sea Kings from Britain in 1969, for ASW duties, designated as Mk42. The purchase also included the provision of air-droppable homing torpedoes for use against submarines. The delivery of the aircraft began a few months before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Due to training shortfalls on the new helicopters, Sea King operations were considerably restricted during the 1971 war; by November 1971, increased aircrew experience had enabled offensive anti-submarine operations to be conducted. The &quot;Majestic&quot;-class aircraft carrier was also refitted in 1972–1974 to enable extensive Sea King operations, becoming the carrier&#x27;s primary anti-submarine aircraft.

During the early 1960s, India and Britain agreed upon the domestic production of the . The initial helicopter deployed aboard India&#x27;s &quot;Leander&quot;s, known as the , was the Aérospatiale Alouette III, however, this offered much less capability in the anti-submarine role compared with the Sea King and the need for design changes was realised to allow the Sea King to be deployed upon the flight deck of the &quot;Nilgiri&quot; class, a practice pioneered by the Royal Canadian Navy using their Sikorsky CH-124 Sea Kings on similar-sized frigates. It proved unfeasible to operate the Sea King from the unmodified &quot;Nilgiri&quot; class, with the last two ships of the class being fitted with an enlarged flight deck and hangar. This required removal of the ship&#x27;s Limbo anti-submarine mortar. Beyond the original 1971 procurement, India chose to acquire a further six Mk42s in 1974, and three more in 1980; these three had been specifically modified to operate from the flight deck of the last two &quot;Nilgiri&quot;s and designated as Mk42A.
As a follow-on to the &quot;Nilgiri&quot;s, India commenced development of a new frigate, based on the &quot;Leander&quot;/&quot;Nilgiri&quot;, but larger. The resultant , also known as Project 16, could operate two Sea Kings simultaneously.

In 1982, India signed a contract to purchase several Mk42B Sea Kings, an upgraded variant to perform dual-purpose: anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions, following a competition for the order against the Aérospatiale Super Puma. These helicopters would operate from the &quot;Godavari&quot;-class frigates as well as replace the existing Sea Kings. A team of Indian engineers was sent to Britain to help develop the Mk42B&#x27;s avionics, especially the onboard software. Changes from the older Sea Kings included a brand new avionics suite, the use of composite materials throughout the fuselage and in the rotor blades, as well as the integration of the Sea Eagle missile, which had been procured from Britain in 1983. Between 1988 and 1992, a total of 20 Mk42B Sea Kings were delivered to the Indian Navy.

Six Sea Kings with troop-carrying capacity, designated Mk42C, were also procured in 1987. Although the Indian Navy considered the AEW Sea King, expected to be designated as Mk42D, it was judged to be too expensive, consequently, in 2003, the Russian Kamov Ka-31 was procured instead. The indigenous HAL Dhruv was the intended replacement for the Sea King in the ASW role, however, in 2000, it was deemed unsuited, as the Indian Navy were dissatisfied with the design&#x27;s folding blade mechanism and by the Dhruv&#x27;s maintenance record.

In May 1998, the United States enacted sanctions upon India as a part of the international response to a series of nuclear weapons tests by India. , these sanctions effectively grounded India&#x27;s Sea Kings because India could not purchase any US-supplied spare parts for the fleet. Westland also complied with the sanctions by refusing to maintain any US-made components. A limited number of Sea Kings were kept operational by cannibalising other aircraft and the manufacture of some components by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). In December 2000, President Bill Clinton permitted a relaxation of the sanctions. In the late 2000s, HAL and AgustaWestland signed an agreement to jointly maintain and perform upgrades to India&#x27;s fleet of Sea Kings.

===Norway===

The Norwegian Ministry of Justice owns 12 Mk43B Sea Kings which are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Forces&#x27;s 330 Squadron. The aircraft are used for SAR and air ambulance missions and are under the command of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway and Northern Norway. Introduced in May 1973, they were originally stationed at Bodø Main Air Station, Ørland Main Air Station, Sola Air Station and Station Group Banak. In 1997, the squadron conducted 237 SAR and 747 air ambulance missions. From 1995 to 1998, one helicopter was stationed at Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and since 1999, one has been stationed at Rygge Air Station. Florø Airport became a station for one helicopter from 2009.

The helicopters are to be replaced by AgustaWestland AW101 under the Norwegian All-Weather Search and Rescue Helicopter (NAWSARH) programme gradually from September 2020. The candidates for the NAWSARH contract of 10–12 helicopters was the AgustaWestland AW101, NHIndustries NH90, Eurocopter EC225 and Sikorsky S-92.
July 2013, AgustaWestland AW101 and Eurocopter (EC225) was short-listed to conduct further discussions for the NAWSARH programme for up to 16 helicopters.

===Germany===

The German Navy placed an order for 22 Sea King Mk.41s on 20 June 1969 as a replacement for the Grumman Albatross flying boat in the Search and Rescue Role. This was the first export sale for the Westland Sea King, and was the first dedicated Search and Rescue Sea King variant, with an enlarged cabin and more fuel. The German Sea Kings had similar radar and navigation equipment to the HAS.1, but was not fitted with sonar. The 22 Sea Kings were delivered between April 1973 and September 1974, equipping &quot;Marinefliegergeschwader&quot; 5 (MFG 5) (Naval Air Wing 5). An additional Sea King was delivered in April 1975 to replace one destroyed in a gale. The surviving Sea Kings were upgraded between 1986 and 1988, adding the capability to carry Sea Skua anti-ship missiles, which required the addition of a Ferranti Seaspray radar in a nose radome.

The 21 remaining Sea Kings are tasked to a variety of roles including SAR, transport, disaster relief, tactical land–sea transport, evacuation, surveillance, reconnaissance and naval support. The main base is Nordholz, although units are always stationed at Heligoland Airfield and Warnemünde, and sometimes at Borkum Airfield. The helicopters are scheduled to be replaced by the NH-90.

HeliOperations continue to operate three Mk 5 Sea Kings, based at RNAS Portland, training German Navy pilots as of 2017. The last German Navy Sea Kings were retired in March 2024, making their last operational flight that month.

===Ukraine===

In November 2022, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the United Kingdom announced they were donating three former Royal Navy Sea Kings to Ukraine. In January 2023, the first Sea King was videoed being used by the Ukrainian Naval Aviation.

In April 2023, the BBC did an interview with one of the co-pilots of a UK donated Sea King to Ukraine. These helicopters served in the Falklands War so they are at least some 40 years old. The co-pilot has said that the Sea King is used for rescuing pilots who have ejected, delivering soldiers, and conducting reconnaissance, among other tasks. One engineer also told the BBC: &quot;They are old...but they have gone through modernisation, and we need them very much. I believe this is just the start of our work together.&quot; The BBC also reports that a third Sea King is being prepared to be sent to Ukraine in the &quot;coming weeks&quot;. The third Sea King HU.5 was delivered to Ukraine in May 2023.

In January 2024, Germany agreed to send 6 further Sea Kings to Ukraine.

===Egypt===

Egypt is a prolific operator of the Sea King, using many different variants for a wide variety of purposes. In addition to operating ASW Sea Kings for coastal patrols, Egypt procured a land-based transport adapted from the basic Sea King, marketed by Westland as the Commando, including a VIP subvariant. An electronic warfare version was also deployed by the Egyptian Air Force, featuring sophisticated onboard jamming systems. As of 2011, 23 Sea Kings/Commandos remain in service with Egypt.

===Qatar===
The Qatar Emiri Air Force also operates Westland&#x27;s Commando variant, as a standard utility transport for ground forces, a single one was also equipped specially to perform VIP transport duties. A few Qatari Sea Kings serve in an anti-shipping capacity and have been outfitted to carry, and deploy if required, two Exocet anti-ship missiles.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan&#x27;s Navy took delivery of six &quot;Mk.45&quot; Sea Kings, a variant based on the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea King HAS.1 from 1975. It served in a combined anti-submarine and anti-ship role, carrying the Exocet missile as an alternative to the normal anti-submarine weapon load of four Mark 44 or Mark 46 torpedoes. One of Pakistan&#x27;s Sea Kings was lost in an accident in February 1986, and was replaced by an ex-Royal Navy HAS.5, redesignated Mk.45C, in January 1989.

===Belgium===
The Belgian Air Force ordered five Sea King Mk.48s to perform Search and Rescue missions in 1974, which entered service in 1976. They were upgraded with new rotor blades in 1987–1988, and with revised avionics, including new radar and provision of a FLIR turret under the nose from 1995. In 2007 Belgium ordered eight NH90 helicopters, of which four were navalised NFH helicopters intended to replace the Sea Kings in the SAR role. Delays in delivery of Belgium&#x27;s NH90s, together with an increased demand for the NH90s to operate from the Belgian Navy&#x27;s frigates, resulted in the retirement date for the Sea Kings being pushed back to 2018. Three Sea Kings remained operational in 2017. 

Belgian Sea Kings had been carried out over 3300 SAR sorties by the end of 2016, with over 1750 lives saved. Belgium retired its last Sea King on 21 March 2019, with a farewell flypass over the Belgian coast. Their SAR role was taken on by four NHIndustries NH90 NATO Frigate Helicopters (NFHs) flying out of Koksijde Air Base near the coast of Flanders. RS05 was donated to &quot;Het Vlaams Luchtvaartopleidingscentrum&quot; (VLOC) and performed its ferry flight on 26/03/2019. Two of the three Belgian Sea Kings were bought by Historic Helicopters of Chard Equestrian, Somerset, which already owned five Westland helicopters that had seen service with the Royal Navy or the RAF. Both Sea Kings left Koksijde Air Base on 20/10/2021 as OO-SEE (RS02) &amp; OO-KNG (RS04) to the UK.

<text>Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a 2000 fantasy adventure film directed by Courtney Solomon (in his feature directorial debut), and written by Carroll Cartwright and Topper Lilien. Based on the role-playing game of the same name, the plot follows an empress who wishes to get hold of a mythical rod that will help her fight an evil wizard, and enlists two thieves for help. The film stars Justin Whalin, Marlon Wayans, Thora Birch, Zoe McLellan, Kristen Wilson, Lee Arenberg, Bruce Payne and Jeremy Irons.

Filming took place on location at Sedlec Ossuary. Despite being a box office bomb, and a critical failure, a made-for-TV sequel, &quot;Wrath of the Dragon God&quot;, was released in 2005. It was not a direct continuation of the storyline of the previous film, though Bruce Payne&#x27;s character, Damodar, makes a return. A third film, &quot;The Book of Vile Darkness&quot;, was shot in 2011 and released direct-to-DVD in the United Kingdom on August 9, 2012.

==Plot==
Izmir&#x27;s young Empress, Savina, rules with the power of a scepter that allows her to control gold dragons. When she wants to give rights to the common people, she&#x27;s opposed by the Council of Mages, led by the evil Profion. They demand that she hand over the scepter. She refuses and, anticipating a conflict, both sides try to get their hands on the legendary Rod of Savrille, which would let them control red dragons.

Teenage thieves Ridley and Snails try to rob the Sumdall magic school. They&#x27;re caught by a young apprentice named Marina, just as Profion&#x27;s assistant Damodar attacks the library wizard to get his map to the Rod of Savrille. Marina, Ridley, and Snails manage to escape with the map, and join with a dwarf named Elwood.

They discover that to enter the tomb containing the Rod, they need a ruby key called the &quot;Eye of the Dragon.&quot; Ridley finds it in a deadly maze in the thieves&#x27; guild in Antius, but Damodar arrives and captures Marina and the map before they can flee. The rest of the group escape, only to be captured by the elf Norda, a paladin who is working for the Empress. Realizing they are fighting for the same cause, they free Marina and get the map back, although Snails dies in the attempt.

They get the Rod of Savrille, although Damodar takes it from them and gives it to Profion. He and the other mages fight against the Empress, with dragons on both sides, until Ridley kills Damodar, and gets the Rod of Savrille back from Profion. Marina encourages Ridley to use the Rod to bring Profion down, but Ridley, realizing the Rod&#x27;s power will corrupt him, refuses and destroys it. Then the Empress has a gold dragon kill Profion.

Ridley later visits the grave of Snails with Marina, Elwood, and Norda. When he places the Eye of the Dragon on the grave, the ruby starts to glow and Snails&#x27; name disappears. Norda tells Ridley to not question his gift and that &quot;his friend awaits him&quot;, and the ruby transports the group away to a mysterious place.

== Development ==
=== Background ===
The earliest attempt at a feature-length adaptation of a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; property by the major film industry date to the early 1980s, as there was a strong interest in producing a film based on &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;; Gary Gygax had several discussions with producers and agents about the idea, and a screenplay by James Goldman received eyeballs from major studios. However, nothing came about this due to conflicts between TSR and the studios. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; player Courtney Solomon, who had personal experience with the entertainment industry as a child because his mother was a production coordinator on television series filmed in Toronto, wanted to produce a film based on the game since 1990.

=== Negotiations and funding ===
==== 1990–1997: TSR and studio deals ====

In 1990, Solomon contacted staff from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;″s publisher, TSR, Inc., under the guise of working on a school economics project; they informed him about studios in the past failing to produce a film based on the game, due to having too little of an understanding of the RPG&#x27;s X-factor. It took him 18 months to convince TSR to set up negotiations, but TSR finally agreed to it, because of his upfront royalty, being better than other studios the company worked with, according to vice president Ryan Dancey. Solomon obtained an option from TSR after writing a 30-page proposal showing how he would adapt the game and going through three months of &quot;intense&quot; broker dealing with the game publisher.

Solomon went on an 18-month-long trip across the world funding the film once a draft of the screenplay was completed, and most of the financing depended on foreign distribution rights. During the trip, he met a leading businessman in Asia named Allan Zeman, who viewed the 24-year-old as a &quot;young, ambitious, artistic person&quot; as well as a &quot;convincing salesman&quot; of a project based on an enterprise with a huge fanbase. In early 1992, Zeman and Solomon formed Sweetpea Entertainment to fund &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and sell it to other investors.

Originally, Solomon planned to have &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; be a $100 million studio project with a big name in the director&#x27;s chair; during development, Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, Renny Harlin, and Stan Winston were attached for directing the film at one point but dropped out. In addition to the script receiving positive coverage from the magazine &quot;Movieline&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot; also announced the project in a 1995 issue when Winston was still signed on, revealing plot details such as a rogue lead, a magical dragon-controlling device, 14 creatures from the original game, and an effects-heavy final battle.

A majority of studios and directors loved the screenplay, but turned away due to a lack of recent successes in the big-budget fantasy genre and Justin Whalin&#x27;s lack of star power. Solomon and the studios he encountered constantly conflicted with TSR, which wanted a direct-to-video release instead of the big-budget theatrical film the Canadian dreamed of. Cameron considered the project just before he did &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), but the deal did not suffice due to TSR&#x27;s failure to come up with a merchandising deal that appealed to 20th Century Fox, where Cameron worked. Potential deals with Paramount Pictures and Lightstorm Entertainment were also destroyed due to strong disagreements on how to finance the film. Solomon&#x27;s amount of focus on getting the film green-lit caused the relationship with his girlfriend to break apart.

==== 1997–1998: Joel Silver and Wizards of the Coast ====

Joel Silver, an executive producer most notable for action films such as the &quot;Die Hard&quot; movies, joined the &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; project in April 1997, and the screenplay was finalized in June 1997. Silver came in with the vision to make it a television series instead of a film. Solomon thus tried to incorporate that plan in his project; however, TSR sold the rights of the original game property to Wizards of the Coast, and despite TSR leader Lorraine Williams telling Solomon Wizards would allow a TV series, that ultimately was not the case.

The plan changed to a $3.5 million direct-to-video film, as the $100 million budget appeared too risky and TSR&#x27;s set filming deadline was nearing; what allowed for the change was technological advancements decreasing required effects money, and the availability of Prague as a shooting location, which had several medieval-era-looking places and thus lessened the need of costly studio sets. Solomon became director and started test shooting a three-minute scene battle in Los Angeles in August 1997. Silver was so roused by it that he stayed on the project as executive producer and thus increased the project&#x27;s credibility to the point where investors raised up to $30 million. This now made the production a theatrical one and also saved the producers from legal action by Wizards of the Coast, who argued it was not a &quot;real&quot; film. Zeman put the money up for the project, in addition to Solomon and his grandfather Joe Smuckler co-signing a $25,000 bank loan, to begin pre-production on February 9, 1998.

Due to filming in a Czech Republic location, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;″ props and sets cost five times less than if shot in the United States. Although the final budget totaled to $35 million, the film was made with $21 million in cash during production, as there were several deferments in effects crew and actors&#x27; pay to meet its intended large scale. To maximize the quality of the film&#x27;s effects with a limited budget, Solomon made equity deals between the effects houses involved so that less money was paid. At the time of its release, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was the biggest-budget independent film ever produced.

=== Writing ===
Solomon began writing the script in 1991 based on the rules of the second edition of the basic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game; he planned &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; to be a film trilogy, his goal being to create &quot;the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of the fantasy genres&quot; using the original trilogy as a template for the story arcs. Two Miramax script doctors, Carroll Cartwright and Topper Lilien, were interviewed to be additional writers in April 1992, thanks to an executive&#x27;s connection with Solomon.

To give the writers an idea of the quality expected in the screenplay, Solomon first required them to view 1980s fantasy films he felt showed the bad state of the genre at the time, and then adventure productions like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). The first draft of the film took eighteen months to complete. Solomon claimed the final product is a collection of different scenes from 16 drafts.

Although the class of characters and rules of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; are brought over to the film, Solomon decided to create a generic setting only loosely based on one of the lesser-known game settings, Mystara; he felt using specific campaign settings heavily dependent on player interpretation would confuse viewers. He also had to risk the combat actions not reflecting how players would use them; for example, &quot;somebody could be casting one of those spells and standing there for ten minutes until the spell is ready to go,&quot; explained Solomon. Spells were occasionally altered if their original descriptions were not &quot;visual&quot; enough to be present on screen; for instance, a Mind Flayer in the film controls another character by going inside him rather than controlling him from a distance. Another small creative liberty was the red dragons being more powerful than the gold dragons.

=== Casting ===

The cast of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was a mixture of established film actors and up-and-comers in Hollywood. Most of the casting took place in London starting April 21, 1999, due to the Prague shooting location; this resulted in the inclusion of actors like the Fourth Doctor actor Tom Baker and Richard O&#x27;Brien, whom Solomon cast with knowledge of his performance as Riff Raff in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), a film released the same year as the first &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. A-list actors were mostly avoided for leads in order for the characters to look like &quot;normal&quot; players of a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; match.

For the part of Ridley, in particular, Solomon looked for &quot;someone who wasn&#x27;t a movie star but who could be.&quot; Whalin, a &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; star who had disinterest in most fantasy films, became a part of the project due to a strong friendship between him and Solomon; he was the only one to join the project before the start of pre-production, entering in December 1997, and had to reject several other acting offers to make himself available. Thora Birch was cast for the project shortly after she finished filming &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999) and before she became a breakthrough actress once it was released; she chose to play the positive-minded empress Savina to get herself out of the somber psyche she put herself in for her role in &quot;American Beauty&quot;. Birch, Whalin, and Kristen Wilson were cast before the start of principal photography.

Mark Leahy, a producer who was involved in the writing for a year and a half working on revisions of Solomon, Cartwright and Lilien&#x27;s original script that were mostly rejected, was the one who conceived the cast being as ethnically diverse as possible; as he explained, &quot;I thought this film had (and has) a chance to really be something special, and knowing that I hated the thought of a bunch of kids watching a great story in another world-where there are only white people.&quot; Leahy originally wrote the elf Liana (later named Norda) to be a black elf, but after contention from his peers, he changed her race to Asian; she was a black elf in the final cut. Leahy wrote what would become Snails as an African-American half-orc in his versions, although this was considered poor taste by his colleagues. He also wrote all members of the mage empire to be Asians.

Wilson, after reading the script, wanted to play Norda specifically due to the character&#x27;s enigma; as she elaborated, &quot;her position within the royal court world...the power that she has, certainly psychologically ..and she&#x27;s a mystic...and then she&#x27;s this incredible warrior. And she doesn&#x27;t really let on too much.. but you can look in her eyes.. and you can see that she&#x27;s not somebody to be trifled with.&quot; In fact, she was so committed to being cast as the elf that when calling the casting director, Wilson demanded to meet Solomon in person and tell him, &quot;I&#x27;m Norda.&quot; The meeting happened, with Solomon and the other producers agreeing with Wilson. The director claimed to have cast Wilson as Norda for the same reasons she liked the character: &quot;She&#x27;s serious and mysterious and very, very cool [...] But when you look at her she doesn&#x27;t look like some sort of prosthetic elf, she looks like she&#x27;s another race. When you see her in the film, she&#x27;s got these wild eyes, this wild exotic look, and she looks like a Dark Elf, which is great, because it&#x27;s what she&#x27;s supposed to be.&quot;

Lee Arenberg and Irons joined during filming, with Irons the last actor to get on board; he did so through the connection of Silver, who previously worked with him on &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; (1995). He initially rejected the opportunity as he was overseeing the renovation of a Ballydehob castle he purchased named Kilcoe. However, Silver then sent a package to Irons made for him by Solomon, which included the script and sketches of the look of the film; this plus his desire to try out a commercial fantasy production and Solomon&#x27;s decade-long tenacity to get the screenplay produced made Irons get on board during filming on July 14, 1999.

The trickiest characters to cast were Elwood and Savina. As Solomon explained the dwarf, &quot;The way I saw the D&amp;D; dwarf was not like a hobbit, they&#x27;re sort of in-between a human and a hobbit. They&#x27;re smaller than an elf, too, so it was hard finding somebody with the height requirements, but also somebody who&#x27;s going to be bulky like a dwarf as well.&quot; Arenberg was chosen to portray Elwood, although before he was cast &quot;American Job&quot; (1996) star Charlie Smith was a contender for the role. The producers originally look for an actor under five feet, but Arenberg went in the audition room and told them, &quot;I have a few more inches but a foot more talent than the other short people.&quot; When looking for the empress Savina, according to Solomon, &quot;that was one of the toughest characters to cast because I was looking to find somebody that young to play the role, because that&#x27;s what that character called for, but I also needed somebody with a depth to her and understanding that&#x27;s beyond her years.&quot;

== Production ==
=== Filming location ===
Shooting of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; took place from May 28 to the middle of August 1999 in Prague, with a two-week rehearsal period that included eight days of a cast read-through at Solomon&#x27;s apartment just before. 2,000 extras were provided by Prague&#x27;s casting agency Sagitarius, with each battle consisting of around 35 stuntmen and five of the leads at most. While working on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Snails actor Marlon Wayans was also filming &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000), meaning he had to go back and forth from Prague to New York and deadlines for fight scenes involving the character became very strict.

While real places were leased for sets, work of the film was also done at Barrandov Studios. &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; was the first feature-length film to use the Sedlec Ossuary, which serves as the interior for Profion&#x27;s lair, as a location; the church was decorated by František Rint with 40,000 skeletons of people who died as the result of the Black Death. The Magic Council meetings were filmed at the city&#x27;s State Opera house, and Irons described them as the most difficult to shoot due to the amount of blue screen work and dialogue involved. Other sites used for sets included Kacina Castle, Rabi Castle, Svaty Mikulas church, Lipnice Castle, the Alkazar Quarry, St. Nicholas&#x27; Cathedral, the Doksany Crypt, the Strahov Library and the Dejvice Sewers.

=== Directing ===
Solomon tried to make &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; unlike other big-budget films that focused the most on effects and not on plot, and was especially careful to make the battle scenes with the dragons not too &quot;cheesy.&quot; Producer Kia Jam described Solomon&#x27;s method of directing and producing as different from how other major studios would create fantasy productions: &quot;they never seem to get it right because I think they replace a true fantasy feel with exorbitant amounts of money in order to achieve it superficially. The feeling has to come from a central source and here that&#x27;s Corey.&quot; One major deviation from other fantasy films was the otherworldliness of the setting, whereas similar products would take place or be heavily inspired by the Middle Ages.

At the same time, the director still went for a strong &quot;wow factor&quot; with the film, where &quot;you have to be able to say &#x27;wow&#x27; at least ten times in the first 30 minutes.&quot; The two toughest scenes for the cast and crew to film were the maze scene and the concluding battle. The battle is eleven minutes long, required more than 280 shots, and was filmed on a 360-degree panoramic blue screen stage due to it involving more than 150 computer-generated dragons; it was tough for the actors as they had to fight while imagining dragons were around them, and it was tough for the director because the actors could not interact with the dragons that would be imposed in post-production later.

Despite playing a dwarf, Arenberg was a 5&#x27;8&quot; actor, which meant he had to stoop his head, squat while still, move with his legs apart, and have extensive costuming in order to look short. He described his role as the hardest he&#x27;d ever done, primarily due to having to perform actions scenes while wearing a red beard that &quot;itched like crazy&quot; and &quot;about 50 pounds of clothing complete with padding.&quot; When directing Wayans&#x27; improvisational method of acting, Solomon offered him the ability to perform three ad-libs in exchange for properly saying three lines in the script. O&#x27;Brien also improvised lines, such as &quot;oh, what a romantic notion&quot; in a scene after Ridley goes through the Thieve&#x27;s Maze; the line was scripted as &quot;honor is for fools, my friend,&quot; but the actor dismissed it as &quot;cliched swords-and-sworcery kind of dialog.&quot;

=== Fight choreography ===

Apart from Wayans, who played the game during his high school years, and Arenberg who was a casual player, none of the leads were familiar with the original game; Jeremy Irons learned a bit about it from his sons who were fans, and Whalin prepared for his role by watching &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games in person, but then &quot;realized that it seemed to be mostly about arguing&quot; and &quot;just put my trust in the script.&quot; While not a player, Wilson&#x27;s knowledge of the game came from groups of her high school peers playing it: &quot;I remembered stories that I heard about kids committing suicide, and all this other nutty stuff. But I didn&#x27;t really know anything about it. I knew that it was a fantasy game ..a roleplaying game and THAT interested me.&quot; When working on the battle sequences, Solomon and the actors had a strong emphasis on making sure they followed the rules of the original game.

Solomon and the producers intended &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; to be a &quot;fun&quot; film that would appeal to younger audiences and fans of the game, which explains the over-the-top performances by actors such as Irons; however, the director also tried to push the PG-13 rating with the violence in the battle sequences. In trying to make the fight scenes have as much realism as possible, Solomon and the choreographers not only used blood and gore, but also had the actors use real swords. Due to the long amount of time a fight scene would be choreographed and filmed, several &quot;repeat blades&quot; of swords were built and used; a total of six repeat blades were made for Damodar&#x27;s sword, two of them broken during shooting.

Most of the principal actors did the stunts themselves, with choreographer Graeme Crowther recalling only &quot;two or three&quot; times a double was required; in fact, when shooting the Thief&#x27;s Maze sequence on the film&#x27;s last day of principal photography, Whalin intentionally wanted the first 300-pound steel axe as close as possible to him in the frame, which Solomon agreed. Instances where Whalin was doubled by Theo Kypri consist mostly of acrobatic shots. The actors&#x27; fighting styles varied from Ridley&#x27;s &quot;quick and dirty&quot; yet &quot;smooth&quot; movements to Elwood&#x27;s hardcore methods to Norda&#x27;s artsy &quot;fluid,&quot; art-like maneuvering, which Wilson attributed to her background in dancing. Whalin&#x27;s experience in taekwondo also aided in his fighting skills.

=== Practical effects ===
Given that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was filmed in Prague, some of the special effects work also took place there, with computer-generated work done in Britain and Germany. The special effects team consisted of George Gibbs, Martin Astles, and Matthew O&#x27;Toole of Bob Keen&#x27;s company Image Effects. Given that the city&#x27;s local sites were extremely cheap, with Solomon hyperbolizing that &quot;sometimes our daily budget was like 15 US dollars,&quot; that made room for a high effects budget of $13 million. However, the effects team had some difficulties. Most of the conception process involved members coming up with various concepts but never agreeing to final designs, meaning compromises had to be determined under deadlines during filming; Astles suggested more time could&#x27;ve been saved if the crew simply borrowed from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; books instead of trying to &quot;cleverly expand&quot; the game&#x27;s universe.

According to Gibbs, the workflow was made even more burdensome by the &quot;communist&quot; nature of the Czech Republic&#x27;s film industry, especially for a big-scale fantasy film. The country&#x27;s recently passed importing laws prevented the makeup people from using the glue specifically designed for the elf ears, meaning the elf actors had to wear more incompatible adhesives. There were also scheduling delays due to properties such as weapons and castle walls made by the Czech crew being poorly manufactured and having to be redone.

Human-crafted special effects included the steel axes in the maze scene, the Corridor of Eyes made all out of stones, and the poly-glass crystals on the balustrade walls of the Magic school, the most challenging one being to reproduce the crystals into breakaway glass. For creating the quicksand carpet, a water tank that made up two meters of the floor was used; it was filled with 6,000 liters of Quaker Oats (the only thickening substance available that did not sink to the ground) on a platform lifted up and down by a scissor lift. There were issues the effects crew did not foresee with the use of the porridge, such as it bubbling away into the air as a reaction to a preservative used to keep it from being moldy. With the carpet scene requiring three takes, Wayans described it as &quot;probably the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever had to do in a movie. I grew up in the projects eating oatmeal, and I didn&#x27;t want to ever eat it again, anyway. Now I really want to stay away from it.&quot;

== Post-production ==
=== Digital effects ===
The computer effects were done by Station X and Blankety Blank. Station X&#x27;s founder, Grant Boucher, had experience in writing for &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; and offered free advice to the crew despite not officially considered part of the production. When filming began, Boucher predicted a total of around 200 shots with digital effects and 75 dragons in the film&#x27;s climax. After filming finished, Solomon claimed the number of shots with digital effects to be 550 and computer-generated settings and characters to be 15, with more than 150 dragons in the climatic showdown. Allen Crawford, a Station X animator, declared four months of computer effects work was spent on the movie&#x27;s first minute. There were also concepts originally planned to be practical effects but were computer-generated in the final edit; this included the gyroscope that holds the scepter, which was initially a machine-controlled device where all attempts for the motors to control it properly failed, and Dexter the pocket dragon which was planned to be an animatronic dragon.

For the dragons, the animators focused the most on their flying and diving cycles, using hawks and eagles as references, as well as their skin, where reptiles such as crocodiles were observed in producing the textures. While the dragons were computer-generated, the fire they blew was done using practical effects, and to be digitally incorporated, the flame throwers were filmed outside during the night time and blown into a steel set hanging on its side.

=== Music ===
Justin Burnett was hired as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dungeons&quot;″ composer, beginning with scoring the test sequence Solomon filmed to convince Silver to become executive producer; the director ordered Burnett to create a John Williams-esque score, specifically in the style of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, which was a change of the rock orchestral rock style he used when composing for German television series. It was the composer&#x27;s third full-length film and his first to use live symphonic orchestra arrangements, with samples for percussion and a few ethnically-tinged instruments; with a &quot;mock-up&quot; score written in a digital sequencer, it was then performed by the Perth Symphony Orchestra in seven recording sessions engineered by Mal Luker. Themes in the score include those for Savina, Profion, Damodar, Ridley and Marina&#x27;s relationship, Ridley and Snails&#x27; friendship, and a &quot;payoff&quot; theme for Ridley inspired by Williams&#x27; one for Indiana Jones.

== Promotion and release ==
Production, release and plot information about the film, as well as original game creator Dave Arneson&#x27;s time on set, were all discussed at the August 1999 Gen Con seminar &quot;History of Roleplaying Games,&quot; hosted by Boucher and Arneson. Role-playing supplements of the film were also announced in development at the same convention. The film&#x27;s official website went online in September 1999. Another unofficial website of information about the project, Dndmovie.com, run by Donald C. Whetsell, went online in November 1999, garnering more than 1.5 million hits by August 2000 and &quot;unusual levels of press and consumer interest,&quot; claimed a New Line Cinema press release. On February 10, 2000, DnDmovie posted two photographs: a screenshot of the meeting between the mages, and a behind-the-scenes photo of Robert Miano waiting on a chair to act in a scene. On May 19, 2000, it revealed a teaser poster.

When principal photography finished, the release date was planned at the earliest to be August 2000, which would coincide with the publication of the third edition of the game, or Halloween 2000 at the latest if post-production went on longer than expected.

The trailer was presented at the 2000 Dragon Con event, where Whalin and Solomon was also at the event to discuss the film.

On August 14, 2000, New Line Cinema, a distributor with prior success in genre films and game adaptations like &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), bought the American distribution rights of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, as well as option rights for a prequel and sequel and television syndication rights, for $5 million. New Line set the domestic release date sometime near the end of the year; the producers originally wanted the release to be in the spring or summer of 2001 to open up more time for setting up licensing and tie-in deals, but none of Warner Bros&#x27; divisions agreed to it. &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; writer Harry suggests New Line made the deal to excite the fantasy film fanbase into a much larger production of the genre, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001). International sales rights were held by J&amp;M Entertainment.

Neal Barrett Jr. wrote the novel &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Movie&quot;, based on the film.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film opened at #5 at the North American box office making US$7,237,422 in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $15,220,685 in the domestic box office, short of the film&#x27;s $45 million budget, and with an international gross of $18,586,724, coming up with a worldwide total of $33,807,409.

===Critical response===
The film was panned by critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 9% of 93 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.2/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Critics say this movie has a cheap look and is badly directed. Despite the presence of talented actors, the performances are really bad, and, additionally, some people are offended at Marlon Wayans&#x27; character, calling it a racist throwback to black stereotypes.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;C+&quot; on a scale of A to F.

Geoff Pevere of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called the film &quot;A wheezy quest story steeped in hobbity gibberish and second-hand Star Wars costumery, featuring a cast so uniformly uncharismatic you may pine for the methody depths of Kerwin Mathews (apart, of course, from the reversely charismatic Irons), the movie has the cheap software look of something found on the Space channel at 4 a.m.&quot;. Steve Biodrowski of mania.com comments: &quot;Let&#x27;s just say that if it weren&#x27;t for &quot;Lost Souls&quot; (also a New Line release, coincidentally), this would be a strong contender for the Worst Film of the Year.&quot; In February 2010, the readers of &quot;Empire&quot; voted &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; the 39th worst film of all time.

A. O. Scott panned the fight choreography, computer-generated effects, and Birch&#x27;s acting, and compared the dialogue and pacing to that of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; films.

Solomon blamed the quality of the film on its investors and license-holders&#x27; interference, as well as his own inexperience in filmmaking. He states that he had only intended to produce the film, but was forced to direct by his investors after nearly a decade of complications dealing with TSR and Wizards of the Coast. He also claims that he was forced to use an older script despite having written an updated version that fit the Dungeons and Dragons license better.

===Awards and nominations===
==Roleplaying game==
Wizards of the Coast released a Fast-Play Game based on the movie called &quot;The Sewers of Sumdall&quot;. It is a DVD-ROM feature on the DVD as a printable PDF file.

==Reboot==

Starting in 2015, a new &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; film began development at Warner Bros. Pictures with the film reportedly starring Ansel Elgort and Rob Letterman directing. In December 2017, after varying degrees of progression the film was moved to Paramount Pictures, Sweetpea Entertainment, and Allspark Pictures, scheduled for release date of July 23, 2021. That same year, Joe Manganiello, an avid fan of the role-playing game, took it upon himself to revitalize the progression of a film adaptation. The actor revealed that he had been negotiating the rights to make the film, while Manganiello and John Cassel were hired to co-write the script for the project.

By February 2018, the project had reentered development as a co-production with Brian Goldner and Stephen Davis producing from Paramount Pictures, and Allspark Pictures. Negotiations began with Chris McKay to serve as director. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick had completed a draft of the script. In March 2019, it was revealed that Michael Gillio had completed a rewrite of Johnson-McGoldrick&#x27;s work with studio executives expressing excitement for the film. The studio began negotiations to casting for the roles.

In July 2019, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein entered early negotiations to direct the film. By January 2020, the filmmaking duo announced that they had co-written a new draft of the script.

The film, entitled &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot;, was released in March 2023. Starring Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Regé-Jean Page, Justice Smith, Sophia Lillis and Hugh Grant, it received largely positive reviews from critics and audiences, but was commercially unsuccessful.

<text>Felix Manz (also Mantz; c. 1498 – 5 January 1527) was an Anabaptist, a co-founder of the original Swiss Brethren congregation in Zürich, Switzerland, and an early martyr of the Radical Reformation.

==Birth and life==

Manz was born and died in Zürich, in the Old Swiss Confederacy, where his father was a canon of Grossmünster church. Though records of his education are scant, there is evidence that he had a liberal education, with a thorough knowledge of Hebrew, Greek and Latin. Manz became a follower of Huldrych Zwingli after he came to Zürich in 1519. When Conrad Grebel joined the group in 1521, he and Manz became friends. They questioned the mass, the nature of church and state connections, and infant baptism. After the Second Disputation of Zürich in 1523, they became dissatisfied, believing that Zwingli&#x27;s plans for reform had been compromised with the city council.

Grebel, Manz and others made several attempts to plead their position. Several parents refused to have their children baptized. A public disputation was held with Zwingli on 17 January 1525. The council declared Zwingli the victor.

After the final rebuff by the city council on 18 January, in which they were ordered to desist from arguing and submit to the decision of the council, and have their children baptized within eight days, the brethren gathered at the home of Felix Manz and his mother on 21 January. Conrad Grebel baptized George Blaurock, and Blaurock in turn baptized the others. This made complete the break with Zwingli and the council, and formed the first church of the Radical Reformation. The movement spread rapidly, and Manz was very active in it. He used his language skills to translate his texts into the language of the people, and worked enthusiastically as an evangelist. Manz was arrested on a number of occasions between 1525 and 1527. While he was preaching with George Blaurock in the Grüningen region, they were taken by surprise, arrested and imprisoned in Zürich at the Wellenburg prison.

==Execution==

On 7 March 1526, the Zürich council had passed an edict that made adult re-baptism punishable by drowning. On 5 January 1527, Felix Manz became the first casualty of the edict, and the first Swiss Anabaptist to be martyred at the hands of magisterial Protestants. While Manz stated that he wished &quot;to bring together those who were willing to accept Christ, obey the Word, and follow in His footsteps, to unite with these by baptism, and to purchase the rest in their present conviction&quot;, Zwingli and the council accused him of obstinately refusing &quot;to recede from his error and caprice&quot;. At 3:00 p.m., as he was led from the Wellenburg to a boat, he praised God and preached to the people. A Reformed minister went along, seeking to silence him, and hoping to give him an opportunity to recant. Manz&#x27;s brother and mother encouraged him to stand firm and suffer for Jesus&#x27; sake. He was taken by boat onto the River Limmat. His hands were bound and pulled behind his knees and a pole was placed between them. He was executed by drowning in Lake Zürich on the Limmat. His alleged last words were, &quot;Into thy hands, O God, I commend my spirit.&quot; His property was confiscated by government of Zürich, and he was buried in the St. Jakobs cemetery. Manz&#x27;s execution predates the Münster Rebellion which officially began in 1534.

Manz left written testimony of his faith, an eighteen-stanza hymn, and was apparently the author of &quot;Protestation und Schutzschrift&quot; (a defense of Anabaptism presented to the Zürich council).

== Legacy ==
The witness of Felix Manz&#x27; life and the other radical Anabaptists continues to be a source of inspiration to Christians today. The Amish, Baptist, Mennonite and Bruderhof churches all are influenced to varying degrees by Manz and the other Reformation-era Anabaptists.

==Hymn==
An 18-stanza hymn by Manz has been preserved and is found in the Ausbund, a 16th-century hymn book still used by the Amish. It is a hymn of praise to God for his great salvation. The seven lines of the first stanza are found below.

<text>This is a complete list of [[Zeppelin]]s constructed by the German Zeppelin companies from 1900 until 1938. Other rigid airships that are also sometimes referred to as zeppelins but not built by Zeppelin are not included.

The Zeppelin company based in Friedrichshafen, Germany, numbered their aircraft &quot;LZ 1/2/ ...&quot;, with &quot;LZ&quot; standing for &quot;Luftschiff [airship] Zeppelin&quot;. Additionally, craft used for civilian purposes were named, whereas military airships were usually given &quot;tactical numbers&quot;:

* The &quot;Deutsches Heer&quot; called its first Zeppelins &quot;Z I/II/ ... /XI/XII&quot;. During World War I they switched to using &quot;LZ&quot; numbers, later adding 30 to obscure the total production.
* The &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;&#x27;s Zeppelins were labelled &quot;L 1/2/ ...&quot;.

Since 1997, airships of the new type Zeppelin NT have been flying. They are not included here. They are not rigid airships and do not represent a continuity of design from the ones listed here.

<doc id="441300" wikidata="Q609768" url="?curid=441300" title="Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory">
<text>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a private, non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer, neuroscience, plant biology, genomics, and quantitative biology. It is located in Laurel Hollow on Long Island, New York.

It is one of 68 institutions supported by the Cancer Centers Program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1987. The Laboratory is one of a handful of institutions that played a central role in the development of molecular genetics and molecular biology.

It has been home to eight scientists who have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. CSHL is ranked among the leading basic research institutions in molecular biology and genetics, with Thomson Reuters ranking it first in the world. CSHL was also ranked first in research output worldwide by &quot;Nature&quot;. The Laboratory is led by Bruce Stillman, a biochemist and cancer researcher.

Since its inception in 1890, the institution&#x27;s campus on the North Shore of Long Island has also been a center of biology education. Current CSHL educational programs serve professional scientists, doctoral students in biology, teachers of biology in the K–12 system, and students from the elementary grades through high school. In the past 10 years, CSHL conferences &amp; courses have drawn over 81,000 scientists and students to the main campus. For this reason, many scientists consider CSHL a &quot;crossroads of biological science.&quot; Since 2009 CSHL has partnered with the Suzhou Industrial Park in Suzhou, China to create Cold Spring Harbor Asia which annually draws some 3,000 scientists to its meetings and courses. The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory School of Biological Sciences, formerly the Watson School of Biological Sciences, was founded in 1999.

In 2015, CSHL announced a strategic affiliation with the nearby Northwell Health to advance cancer therapeutics research, develop a new clinical cancer research unit at Northwell Health in Lake Success, NY, to support early-phase clinical studies of new cancer therapies, and recruit and train more clinician-scientists in oncology.

CSHL hosts bioRxiv, a preprint repository for publications in the life sciences.

==Research programs==
Research staff in CSHL&#x27;s 52 laboratories numbers over 600, including postdoctoral researchers; an additional 125 graduate students and 500 administrative and support personnel bring the total number of employees to over 1,200.

COVID-19

Scientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), Utah Health University, PEEL Therapeutics, and Weill Cornell Medicine worked to examine the possible function of NETs in COVID-19, gather blood samples from 33 hospitalized individuals, as well as autopsy tissue. Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) are a form of protection which is utilized by the immune system against certain pathogens.

==Educational programs==

In addition to its research mission, CSHL has a broad educational mission. The School of Biological Sciences (SBS), established in 1998, awards the Ph.D. degree and fully funds the research program of every student. Students are challenged to obtain their doctoral degree in 4–5 years. The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) for gifted college students (established in 1959), and the Partners for the Future Program for advanced high school students (established in 1990) are now hosted at the SBS.

The CSHL Meetings &amp; Courses Program brings over 8,500 scientists from around the world to Cold Spring Harbor annually to share research results – mostly unpublished—in 60 meetings, most held biannually; and to learn new technologies in 30 to 35 professional courses, most offered annually. The Cold Spring Harbor Symposium series, held every year since 1933 with the exception of three years during the Second World War, has been a forum for researchers in genetics, genomics, neuroscience and plant biology. At the Banbury Center, about 25-30 discussion-style meetings are held yearly for a limited number of invited participants. As of 2016, a two-week course at CSHL costs between $3,700 and $4,700 per student and three-day conferences cost about $1,000 per attendee.

The DNA Learning Center (DNALC), founded in 1988, was among the early pioneers in developing hands-on genetics lab experiences for middle and high school students. In 2013, 31,000 students on Long Island and New York City were taught genetics labs at the DNALC and satellite facilities in New York. Over 9,000 high school biology teachers have participated in DNALC teacher-training programs.

The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press has established a program consisting of seven journals, 190 books, laboratory manuals and protocols, and online services for research preprints.

==Funding==
In 2015, CSHL had an operating budget of $150 million, over $100 million of which was spent on research. Half of the research budget was devoted to cancer; 25% to neuroscience; 15% to genomics and quantitative biology; and 10% to plant sciences. The sources of research funding in 2015 were: 34% Federal (primarily National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation); 26% auxiliary activities; 22% private philanthropy; 10% endowment; 3% corporate.

==History==
The institution took root as The Biological Laboratory in 1890, a summer program for the education of college and high school teachers studying zoology, botany, comparative anatomy and nature. The program began as an initiative of Eugene G. Blackford and Franklin Hooper, director of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, the founding institution of The Brooklyn Museum. In 1904, the Carnegie Institution of Washington established the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor on an adjacent parcel. In 1921, the station was reorganized as the Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics.

Between 1910 and 1939, the laboratory was the base of the Eugenics Record Office of biologist Charles B. Davenport and his assistant Harry H. Laughlin, two prominent American eugenicists of the period. Davenport was director of the Carnegie Station from its inception until his retirement in 1934. In 1935 the Carnegie Institution sent a team to review the ERO&#x27;s work, and as a result the ERO was ordered to stop all work. In 1939 the Institution withdrew funding for the ERO entirely, leading to its closure. The ERO&#x27;s reports, articles, charts, and pedigrees were considered scientific facts in their day, but have since been discredited. Its closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act (Immigration Act of 1924), which severely reduced the number of immigrants to America from southern and eastern Europe who, Harry Laughlin testified, were racially inferior to the Nordic immigrants from England and Germany. Charles Davenport was also the founder and the first director of the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations in 1925. Today, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory maintains the full historical records, communications and artifacts of the ERO for historical, teaching and research purposes. The documents are housed in a campus archive and can be accessed online and in a series of multimedia websites.

Carnegie Institution scientists at Cold Spring Harbor made many contributions to genetics and medicine. In 1908 George H. Shull discovered hybrid corn and the genetic principle behind it called heterosis, or &quot;hybrid vigor.&quot; This would become the foundation of modern agricultural genetics. In 1916, Clarence C. Little was among the first scientists to demonstrate a genetic component of cancer. E. Carleton MacDowell in 1928 discovered a strain of mouse called C58 that developed spontaneous leukemia – an early mouse model of cancer. In 1933, Oscar Riddle isolated prolactin, the milk secretion hormone and Wilbur Swingle participated in the discovery of adrenocortical hormone, used to treat Addison&#x27;s disease.

Milislav Demerec was named director of the Laboratory in 1941. Demerec shifted the Laboratory&#x27;s research focus to the genetics of microbes, thus setting investigators on a course to study the biochemical function of the gene. During World War Two, Demerec directed efforts at Cold Spring Harbor that resulted in major increases in penicillin production.

Beginning in 1941, and annually from 1945, three of the seminal figures of molecular genetics convened summer meetings at Cold Spring Harbor of what they called the Phage Group. Salvador Luria, of Indiana University; Max Delbrück, then of Vanderbilt University; and Alfred Hershey, then of Washington University in St. Louis, sought to discover the nature of genes through study of viruses called bacteriophages that infect bacteria.

* In 1945, Delbrück&#x27;s famous Phage Course was taught for the first time, inspiring, among others, a young James D. Watson; it was repeated for many years after. CSH Symposia important in the cross-fertilization of ideas among molecular biology&#x27;s pioneers were held in 1951, 1953, 1956, 1961, 1963, and 1966. 
* At the CSH Symposium in summer 1953, Watson made the first public presentation of DNA&#x27;s double-helix structure.

==Leadership==
In 1962, the Department of Genetics, no longer supported by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, formally merged with the Biological Laboratory to form the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology. In 1970, the name was simplified to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

John F. Cairns was appointed as the Director of the merged Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1963 and found that in the absence of continued financial support from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the newly created institution was in desperate need of funds to support its programs and update facilities. Cairns stabilized the Laboratory and made essential improvements to the facilities. He decided in 1968 that he would step down as Director and he remained at CSHL until 1973, moving then to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (now Cancer Research UK) in Mill Hill near London, UK. While at CSHL, Cairns performed important experiments on DNA replication in the bacteria &quot;E. coli&quot;.

James D. Watson served as the Laboratory&#x27;s director and president for 35 years. Upon taking charge in 1968, he focused the Laboratory on cancer research, creating a tumor virus group and successfully obtaining federal funds for an expansion of cancer research capabilities. Watson placed CSHL on a firm financial footing. Inspired by his Nobel collaborator, Francis Crick, Watson initiated a major push to scale-up CSHL research on the brain and psychiatric disorders, beginning in the late 1980s. In 1990, work was completed on the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Laboratory, and the Marks Neuroscience Building was opened in 1999. In 1994, Watson ceased being director of the Laboratory and assumed the title of president. In 2004 he was named chancellor, a position he held until October 2007, when he retired at the age of 79 after views attributed to him on race and intelligence appeared in the British press. In January 2019, CSHL severed all ties with Watson—and revoked his honorary titles—after he unequivocally restated these views in an American Masters television profile.

Since 1994 biochemist and cancer biologist Bruce Stillman has led the Laboratory as director, and since 2003 as president. Stillman, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the Royal Society, also continues to run a basic research lab, devoted to the study of DNA replication and chromosome maintenance. Stillman is credited with the 1991 discovery and elucidation of the mechanism of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), a highly conserved protein complex that recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences, marking starting points for replication of the entire genome.

Stillman has presided over a major expansion of the Laboratory, its size growing threefold since he became director. With construction completed on six linked laboratory buildings on the Hillside Campus in 2009, CSHL added much-needed new laboratory space for cancer and neuroscience research, as well as space for a new program on quantitative biology to bring experts in mathematics, computer science, statistics, and physics to problems in biology.

In 2007 the CSHL suspended him for his support for scientific racism but after he issued a public apology he was allowed to retain honorary titles, though he was relieved his leadership and managerial roles. In 2019 CSHL rescinded his honorary titles after he made public remarks again suggesting IQ and race were related, comments which CSHL viewed as a reversal of the apology he gave in 2007. In 2020 the Watson School of Biological Sciences (WSBS) was renamed to delete any reference to him.

== Double Helix Medal ==
Each year, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory awards a Double Helix Medal to individuals who have positively impacted human health, either by raising awareness and funds for biomedical research, or contributing in a major way to biological and biomedical research.

<text>The Miami Orange Bowl was an outdoor athletic stadium in Miami, Florida from 1937 until 2008. The stadium was located in the Little Havana neighborhood west of downtown Miami. The venue was considered a landmark and served as the home stadium for the Miami Hurricanes college football team from 1937 through 2007 and for the Miami Dolphins for the Dolphins&#x27; first 21 seasons, until Joe Robbie Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) opened in nearby Miami Gardens in 1987. The stadium also was the temporary home for the FIU Golden Panthers for one year, in 2007, while its on-campus FIU Stadium underwent expansion.

Opened in 1937, it was originally known as Burdine Stadium. In 1949, it was renamed the Orange Bowl for the Orange Bowl college football bowl game, which was played annually at the venue following every season from 1938 to 1996. The event was moved to Pro Player Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) beginning on December 31, 1996. In January 1999, it returned to the Orange Bowl a final time due to a scheduling conflict. From 1956 to 1960, the Minor League Baseball Miami Marlins team occasionally played games in the Orange Bowl.

The stadium was located on a large city block bound by Northwest 3rd Street to its south, Northwest 16th Avenue to its west, Northwest 6th Street to its north, and Northwest 14th Avenue to its east, which was an open end of the stadium.

The Orange Bowl was demolished in 2008. LoanDepot Park, the home ballpark of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball, was built on the site. Construction began in July 2009, and the new stadium opened on March 5, 2012.

==History==
===Early 20th century===



The Miami Orange Bowl, initially called Burdine Stadium after Roddy Burdine, one of Miami&#x27;s pioneers and the owner of the Burdines department store chain, was built by the City of Miami Public Works Department. Construction began in 1936 and was completed in December 1937 and featured stadium lights. Prior to completion, the first game was a high school game on September 24, 1936, in which Miami Edison Senior High School shut out Ponce de Leon, 36–0. During this opening game, the stadium&#x27;s new lighting system went partially out, leaving the mid-field dark with five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.

The stadium opened for Miami Hurricanes football on December 10, 1937. From 1926 to 1937, the University of Miami played in a stadium near Tamiami Park and also at Moore Park until the Orange Bowl was built.

For a brief time in the late 1930s, the Orange Bowl was home to the headquarters of the International Baseball Federation.

The stadium originally seated 23,739 people along the sidelines, roughly corresponding to the lower level of the sideline seats in the stadium&#x27;s final configuration. Attendance for its first Orange Bowl in January 1938 was under 19,000, but the following year saw over 32,000 in attendance. Seating was added in the end zones in the 1940s, and by the end of the 1950s the stadium was double-decked on the sidelines. In 1966, the AFL expansion Miami Dolphins played their first-ever regular season game in the stadium on September 2. The west end zone upper deck section was then added in the 1960s, bringing the stadium to its peak capacity of 80,010. On January 1, 1965, the Orange Bowl was the first college bowl game to be televised in prime time.

===Late 20th century===
From 1966 to 1968, and again in the 1970s, a live dolphin was situated in a water tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl. He would jump in the tank to celebrate touchdowns and field goals. The tank that was set up in the 1970s was manufactured by Evan Bush and maintained during the games by Evan Bush and Dene Whitaker. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs and the 1970s due to stress. In the film &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, Snowflake, a live dolphin who does special behaviors after the Dolphins score a touchdown, was the basis of the film after he is kidnapped as part of a revenge plot against Dan Marino.

In 1977, the permanent seats in the east end zone were removed, and further upgrades brought the stadium to its final capacity and design. The city skyline was visible to the east through the open end, over the modern scoreboard and palm trees. The surface was natural grass, except for six seasons in the 1970s. Poly-Turf, an artificial turf similar to AstroTurf, was installed for the 1970 football season. It was removed and replaced with a type of natural grass known as &quot;Prescription Athletic Turf&quot; after Super Bowl X in January 1976.

In 1980, the stadium was used as a holding facility for Cuban refugees, who arrived in South Florida during the Mariel Boatlift.

Under the leadership of Hall of Fame head coach Don Shula, the Miami Dolphins enjoyed a winning record in the Orange Bowl against rival teams in the AFC Eastern Division. Under Shula, the Dolphins were an impressive 57–9–1 (60–10–1 including playoff contests) against the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (15–3), the Boston/New England Patriots (15–1), the Buffalo Bills (16–1) and the New York Jets (13–4–1). They have also beaten every visiting franchise at least once, enjoying perfect records against 11 of them. The playoff results against AFC East opponents are: AFC Championship games: (1971, Miami 21, Baltimore 0); (1982, Miami 14, New York Jets 0) and (1985, New England 31, Miami 14) and AFC First round game (1982 strike shortened season, Miami 28, New England 13).

Notable winning streaks during the Shula-era in the Orange Bowl include a 13–0 streak against the Buffalo Bills and a 15–0 streak against the New England Patriots, Also of note, the Miami Dolphins enjoyed a record 31-game home winning streak from 1971–75, which includes four playoff wins and the perfect season of 1972. The Dolphins have not enjoyed the same level of success at Hard Rock Stadium. While much of this lack of success at Hard Rock Stadium is obviously attributable to a diminished level of talent and organizational stability, it is also widely recognized that the homefield advantage that the Dolphins enjoyed in the Orange Bowl was exponentially greater than in their newer home. This was in great part due to the atmosphere of the Orange Bowl. The closeness of the seats to the field, along with the closed West End Zone, metal bleachers, and steel structure (and of course the team&#x27;s success and its status as Miami&#x27;s only professional sports team for so many years), made the Bowl one of the loudest and most electric stadiums in the NFL. Visiting team quarterbacks often complained to referees or were forced to call time out as their teammates could not hear them barking out the signals due to the unbearable noise, especially when the Dolphins were making a goal-line stand in the closed West End Zone. While Hard Rock Stadium is much newer and cleaner and is considered one of the top facilities in the NFL, with top-notch amenities, the seats are set further back from the field than comparable seats at the Orange Bowl. As a result, even at its loudest, Hard Rock Stadium is nowhere near as loud as the Orange Bowl.

The Orange Bowl was also the site of the NCAA&#x27;s longest college football home field winning streak. Between 1985 and 1994, the Miami Hurricanes won 58 straight home games at the Bowl, until ended by the Washington Huskies. The stadium&#x27;s home field advantage used to include a steel structure that fans would set to rumbling by stomping their feet. Concrete reinforcement had silenced the rumble in the stadium&#x27;s later years. There was still the advantage of the West End Zone, which had a relatively narrow radius that amplified fan noise. The West End Zone was a factor in the Wide Right curse, in which the Florida State Seminoles lost a series of close games due to missed field goals. This section was so raucous that some football announcers often confused it with the student section.

In addition to football, the stadium also hosted concerts and other public events. The stadium had a regular capacity of 74,476 orange seats, and could seat up to 82,000 for concerts and other events where additional seating would have been placed on the playing field.

===21st century===
The last professional football game to be played in the Orange Bowl took place on April 29, 2000, and matched the Miami Tropics against the San Antonio Matadors of the short-lived Spring Football League. The Matadors won 16–13.

===College football===
The City of Miami embarked on a plan to extensively renovate the stadium. However, those plans fell by the wayside as Miami focused on keeping the Florida Marlins in town, forcing the Hurricanes to threaten a move to Dolphin Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) in suburban Miami Gardens if a plan to renovate the stadium was not in place within 45 days. Some feared that Miami would permit the college to leave, only to tear down the Orange Bowl and replace it with the new stadium for the Marlins.

That fear became reality as Paul Dee, athletic director for the University of Miami, announced that the Hurricanes would be moving to Dolphin Stadium for the 2008 season. Dee and university president Donna Shalala made the announcement during a press conference at the Hecht Athletic Center on August 21, 2007. The university agreed to a 25-year contract to play at then Dolphin Stadium. According to Miami City Manager Pete Hernandez, this put the Orange Bowl back in the forefront as a possible site for a new Marlins stadium. The hope that talks would resume soon on that possibility vanished after only a short while.

Many Hurricane fans vocally opposed the decision to move stadium locations and preferred maintaining the Orange Bowl as the Hurricanes&#x27; home field, out of concern of Dolphin Stadium&#x27;s extra distance from campus, the severing of an icon of the Hurricanes&#x27; historical successes on the field, and potentially more expensive parking costs.

Many fans stated to various broadcast, print and internet-based media outlets that they would no longer attend the games of Hurricanes football once the team abandoned the Orange Bowl. Some speculated that the decision to leave the Orange Bowl might have cursed the Miami Hurricanes and would cite the Miami Dolphins as a precedent. Indeed, a common explanation for the Miami Hurricanes&#x27; poor performance during the 2007 season was that &quot;they&#x27;ve never been the same since they left the Orange Bowl.&quot; The University of Miami lost their final Orange Bowl game to Virginia, 48–0, in a nationally televised ESPN game. It was the most lopsided home shutout loss in the Miami program&#x27;s history until Clemson beat Miami 58–0 in 2015.

The last home game of college football in the Orange Bowl was a home win for the FIU Golden Panthers against North Texas. FIU had been using the Orange Bowl as home field for the season due to renovations to their home stadium. Miami and FIU had engaged in a bench clearing brawl at the Orange Bowl the previous year during the first of two scheduled games between the two schools.

===Motorcycle fatality===

On February 8, 1997, the Miami Orange Bowl was host to a U.S. Hot Rod Monster Jam. As part of the show, motorcycle stunt rider Corey Scott attempted a stunt that required him to drive up a ramp and land into a net hoisted into the air. Scott missed the net, bounced out, and fell to the ground below. He later died at Jackson Memorial Hospital. The event was witnessed by a crowd of around 30,000 spectators.

===Hurricane Wilma===
In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma caused structural damage to the stadium, which rekindled discussion of tearing down the aging facility. The damage was subsequently repaired after the 2005 college football season. The stadium served as a FEMA relief center in the hurricane&#x27;s aftermath.

===Final year and demolition===

The Orange Bowl was demolished in May 2008, and LoanDepot Park is now on the site. Despite some protests, the historic stadium had been earmarked for demolition when the University of Miami announced that they were moving out of the Orange Bowl after the 2007 season to begin play at Sun Life Stadium in 2008 in a 25-year deal. On November 10, 2007, the University of Miami Hurricanes lost their final game at the Orange Bowl when the Virginia Cavaliers defeated Miami 48–0 in the Hurricanes&#x27; second worst home shutout loss in school history.

The FIU Golden Panthers (now Panthers) won their last game at the Orange Bowl against the North Texas Mean Green on December 1, 2007, by a score of 38–19, snapping a 23-game losing streak that many attributed to the consequences of suspensions following the UM-FIU brawl the year before. Since the Golden Panthers had been using the Orange Bowl as their home field during the construction of FIU Stadium, this win allowed the FIU team to boast that it was they who officially closed the Orange Bowl&#x27;s college football career with a home win.

A high school all-star game, &quot;The Offense-Defense All-American Bowl&quot;, took place on January 4, 2008, and was the last game before the closing events.

On Saturday, January 26, 2008, a &quot;Farewell to the Orange Bowl Stadium&quot; flag football game was held. The game featured former Dolphin and Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino, plus Mark Duper, Mercury Morris, Dwight Stephenson, A. J. Duhe, Don Strock, Jim Kiick, John Offerdahl, Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar, Melvin Bratton, Brian Blades, Bennie Blades and Eddie Brown. The NFL&#x27;s winningest coach Don Shula coached the Dolphins while Florida Atlantic University and former Hurricanes coach and former Dolphins assistant Howard Schnellenberger coached the University of Miami.

The Orange Bowl was open to the public for the last time February 8–10, 2008 when a public auction of stadium artifacts and memorabilia was held. The stadium was stripped and pieces were sold by a company called Mounted Memories. Demolition of the Orange Bowl began on March 3, 2008, and was completed on May 14, 2008.

The Orange Bowl is one of eight stadiums that are no longer standing that have hosted a Super Bowl. The other seven are: Tulane Stadium (hosted three Super Bowls; demolished in 1980), Tampa Stadium (hosted two Super Bowls; demolished in 1999), Stanford Stadium (hosted one Super Bowl; demolished and redeveloped in 2006), the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (hosted one Super Bowl; demolished in 2014), the Georgia Dome (hosted two Super Bowls; demolished in 2017), the Pontiac Silverdome (hosted one Super Bowl; demolished in 2018), and San Diego Stadium (hosted three Super Bowls; demolished in 2021).

==Commemorative marker==
As part of the new Marlins Park, the home field of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball, Miami-Dade County Art in Public Places commissioned Daniel Arsham and Snarkitecture to design a public art work to commemorate the Miami Orange Bowl. Their project uses the letters from the original &quot;Miami Orange Bowl&quot; sign as the basis for the orange concrete letters rearranged across the east plaza of the new ballpark so that they form new words as visitors move around them.

===Baseball===
*Miami Marlins – An estimated 57,000 fans watched 50-year-old Satchel Paige pitch there for the Marlins on Aug. 7, 1956. On that occasion, the diamond was tucked into the southeast corner of the stadium, with a high temporary fence in front of the right field seating area. The minor league Marlins played occasional other games there between 1956 and 1960.
*1990 Caribbean Series – The 20th edition of the second stage of the Caribbean Series was held at the Orange Bowl, which had not hosted baseball in decades. Many considered the series a botched experiment, especially since the stadium, by 1990, was ill-suited for baseball. Only about 50,000 fans attended during the seven-day Series, which featured teams from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The Leones del Escogido of the Dominican League won the title, led by manager Felipe Rojas Alou and series MVP Gerónimo Berroa.

====Miami Field====

Tucked into the northeast corner of 16th Avenue and Third Street, a ball field called Tatum Park was built in time for spring training in 1916. The park was used for spring training games for six seasons, but with no new tenants booked, it was abandoned and demolished in December 1921.[Miami &quot;News&quot;, December 22, 1921, pp. 3, 14, 31]
In 1924, new seating was built on the site, and this facility was called Miami Field.[Miami &quot;Herald&quot;, May 22, 1924, p. 15] It resumed being a site for spring training and other local events, including a revived Florida East Coast League minor league club. It served as the home field for University of Miami baseball from 1940 through 1965. Both the old and the new fields had a small covered seating area at 16th and Third.

As the Orange Bowl was developed and then expanded over time, it encroached somewhat on that small ballpark to its southwest. The ballpark&#x27;s center field fence ran along the periphery of the stadium&#x27;s outer concourse, and the right field fence bordered a driveway that led up to the big stadium.

There was also a softball field to the east across the driveway. During football season, the baseball and softball fields were both used for parking. In December 1965, Miami Field&#x27;s seating area was demolished, and the land occupied by the two fields was reconfigured into full-time parking areas. The Hurricanes played elsewhere for a few years, and then opened Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field in 1973.

Miami Field can be seen in the 1940 aerial photo :File:Miami-Orange-Bowl-1940.jpg. It also appears often in old aerial view postcards of the big stadium.

<text>Francisco Alves Mendes Filho, better known as Chico Mendes (; 15 December 1944 – 22 December 1988), was a Brazilian rubber tapper, trade union leader, and environmentalist. He fought to preserve the Amazon rainforest, and advocated for the human rights of Brazilian peasants and Indigenous people. He was assassinated by a rancher on 22 December 1988. The Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation ( or ICMBio), a body under the jurisdiction of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, is named in his honor.

==Early life==

Francisco &quot;Chico&quot; Alves Mendes Filho was born on 15 December 1944, in a rubber reserve called Seringal Bom Futuro, outside of Xapuri, a small town in the state of Acre. He was the son of a second-generation rubber tapper, Francisco Mendes, and his wife, Iracê. Chico was one of 17 siblings—only six of whom survived childhood.

At age 9, Chico began work as a rubber tapper alongside his father. At the time, the rubber industry across the nation was in decline, and land was frequently sold and burned for cattle pastures.

Rubber tappers additionally faced a severe lack of education. Schools were frequently forbidden on and near plantations, as the owners did not want the workers to be able to read and do arithmetic. For this reason, Mendes did not learn to read until he was 18 years old, when he sought out help interpreting his bills.

Mendes was taught to read and write by a man named Euclides Fernando Távora, an activist turned rubber tapper. Most of his practice came from newspaper clippings on social and political issues within Brazil. These articles opened Chico&#x27;s eyes to the widespread injustices in society, adding to his dissatisfaction with the treatment of seringueiros.

After learning what he could from Távora, Mendes became a literacy teacher in hopes of educating his community. As his fellow workers became more aware of unjust treatment, they formed the Rural Workers’ Union, and the more localized Xapuri Rubber Tappers Union. Both of these organizations worked through peaceful protest to stop the logging and burning of the rainforest that acted as their livelihood.

By the mid-1980s, Chico was known as both a radical unionist and an activist, though he also ran for several local political positions such as state deputy and city councilor.

==Activism==
To save the rainforest, Chico Mendes and the rubber workers union asked the government to set up reserves as they wanted people to use the forest without damaging it. They also used a very effective technique they called the &#x27;empate&#x27; where rubber tappers blocked the way into rubber reserves, preventing their destruction.

The Rubber Tappers&#x27; Union was created in 1975 in the nearby town of Brasileia, with Wilson Pinheiro elected as the union&#x27;s president and Mendes as its secretary.

Mendes also played a central role in the creation of the National Council of Rubber Tappers in the mid-1980s. Mendes&#x27; group also had strong ties with the National Campaign for the Defence and Development of the Amazon, and helped organize local Workers&#x27; Party support.

When the first meeting of this new union was held in 1985 in the capital Brasília, rubber tappers from all over the country came. The discussion expanded from the threats to their own livelihoods to the larger issues of road paving, cattle ranching, and deforestation. The meeting also caught the attention of the international environmentalist movement, giving the rubber tappers a larger audience for their grievances. The group embraced a larger alliance with environmentalism, rather than strict Marxism, in spite of the bourgeois associations of the former. Another result of these discussions was the coining of the concept and the term &quot;extractive reserves&quot;. In November of that year, Adrian Cowell, an English filmmaker, filmed much of the proceedings of this meeting as part of a documentary he was making about Mendes, which aired in 1990.

Mendes believed that relying on rubber tapping alone was not sustainable, and that the &quot;seringueiros&quot; needed to develop more holistic, cooperative systems that used a variety of forest products, such as nuts, fruit, oil, and fibers; and that they needed to focus on building strong communities with quality education for their children.

In March 1987, the Environmental Defense Fund and National Wildlife Federation flew Mendes to Washington, D.C. in an attempt to convince the Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, and U.S. Congress to support the creation of extractive reserves.

Mendes won several awards for his work, including the United Nations Environmental Program Global 500 Roll of Honor Award in 1987, and the National Wildlife Federation&#x27;s National Conservation Achievement Award in 1988.

In 1988 a man named Darly Alves da Silva bought part of a rubber reserve called Cachoeira, where relatives of Mendes lived, and which was affiliated to the local Rural Workers Union in Xapuri. While the sale of the section was disputed by the family of the vendor, who claimed he had no legal right to sell it, Silva tried to drive them off their land and increase his ranch holdings. The rubber tappers of Cachoeira stood firm and set up road blocks to keep Silva out.

In 1988, Mendes launched a campaign to stop Silva from logging the area that its inhabitants wanted demarcated as an extractive reserve. Mendes not only managed to stop the planned deforestation and create the reserve, but also gained a warrant for Darly&#x27;s arrest for a murder committed in another state, Paraná. He delivered the warrant to the federal police, but it was never acted upon.

==Assassination==
Mendes had received death threats for years before his murder. However, in the months prior to his death, various pairs of gunmen hired by Silva observed Mendes from a square near his house and the town union hall.

On the evening of Thursday, 22 December 1988, Mendes was shot and killed in his Xapuri home by Darci, the son of Darly Alves da Silva. The shooting took place exactly one week after Mendes&#x27; 44th birthday when he had predicted he would &quot;not live until Christmas&quot;.

Around his birthday, the gunmen who had been observing him disappeared completely. Their absence gave the community a sense of impending doom, as they had been constantly present since May of the same year. The timing of their disappearance led many to believe they had unsuccessfully attempted to kill Mendes on his birthday but had failed because of numerous guests present at his house.

Mendes was the 90th rural activist murdered that year in Brazil. Many felt that although the trial was proceeding against Mendes&#x27; killers, the roles of the ranchers&#x27; union, the Rural Democratic Union, and the Brazilian Federal Police in his death were ignored.

In December 1990, Silva, his son Darci, and their employee Jerdeir Pereira were sentenced to 19 years in prison for their part in Mendes&#x27; assassination. In February 1992, they won a retrial, claiming that the prosecution&#x27;s primary witnessMendes&#x27; wife Ilsamarwas biased. The conviction was upheld, and they remained in prison. In 1993, they escaped from jail, along with seven other prisoners, by sawing through the bars of their prison window. All were recaptured, including Darly Jr., who served the remainder of his sentence with the other killers before returning to Xapuri.

On 28 February 2024, the son, Darci Alves Pereira, became the president of the Liberal Party in Medicilândia, a municipality in southwestern Pará. On the same day, the party reported that he was removed from office. Valdemar Costa Neto, national president of the party, said he had &quot;no knowledge&quot; it was Chico Mendes&#x27; murderer assuming Pará&#x27;s party chapter presidency.

Mendes&#x27; murder made international headlines and led to an outpouring of support for the rubber tappers&#x27; and environmental movements. In March 1989, a third meeting was held for the National Council of Rubber Tappers, and the Alliance of Forest Peoples was created to protect rubber tappers, rural workers, and Indigenous peoples from encroachment on traditional lands.

== Post-assassination impact ==
Chico Mendes’ death legitimized the struggle for conservation and unionization in the Amazon for a global audience, and support for the movements poured in immediately following his death. The strides forward made by activists in the wake of Mendes’ death are multifaceted, encompassing Indigenous sovereignty and alliance, the formation of extractive reserves, and government support for Mendes’ activism.

=== Grassroots organizing ===
The National Council of Rubber Tappers was founded in 1985 by Mendes and other union members; in March 1989, three months after Mendes’ murder, the council held their third meeting. The Council issued twenty-seven demands on environmental and human rights protection. They also issued the following statement, titled the Declaration of the Peoples of the Forest:

The traditional peoples who today trace on the Amazonian sky the rainbow of the Alliance of the Peoples of the Forest declare their wish to see their regions preserved. They know that the development of the potential of their people and of the regions they inhabit is to be found in the future economy of their communities, and must be preserved for the whole Brazilian nation as part of its identity and self-esteem. This Alliance of the Peoples of the Forest, bringing together Indians, rubber tappers, and riverbank communities, and founded here in Acre, embraces all efforts to protect and preserve this immense but fragile life-system that involves our forests, rivers, lakes and springs, the source of our wealth and the basis of our cultures and traditions.

This indicates an increase in perceived support and an ensuing increase in demands by the National Council, responding to the context of Mendes’ death. 1986 marks the creation of the Alliance of Forest Peoples, tasked with protecting rubber tappers, rural workers, and Indigenous peoples from encroachment on traditional lands, and this group also found new footholds in the wake of Mendes’ murder. This political leverage gave the people of the forest (largely rubber tappers and Indigenous people) access to important victories. One of the most important and tangible victories was the demarcation of Kayapo and Yanomami lands in November 1991, overseen by the Collor administration. However, despite the successes Indigenous peoples saw in land recognition during this time, the sovereign nations experienced intense violence within their borders by outsiders during the following years.

=== Changes within the Brazilian government ===
The years after Mendes’ murder also saw a focus on Mendes’ personal advocacy projects. One of Mendes’ main ideas, and a lasting impact of his life and activism, is Brazil&#x27;s extractive reserves - forest land set aside by the Brazilian government to be managed cooperatively by locals, who keep it healthy while gathering its rubber, nuts, and other products to sell. These extractive reserves are funded in part by the World Bank, which once financed roads to make the Amazon easier to cut down. Their change of heart can be attributed to Mendes’ in-person, extensive lobbying of the organization. Following the increased pressure by the international community in the wake of the violence, the Brazilian government agreed to create extractive reserves and to demarcate Indian lands. The increased local support for Mendes’ activism also saw several of Mendes’ co-campaigners were elected to important government offices over the next decade, which created a more receptive environment for legislation protecting the Amazon forests. Furthermore, The Brazilian government has declared him Patron of the Brazilian Environment. Institutions have been named after him, including the main state agency in charge of conservation – the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade.

== Honors ==
===Sierra Club Chico Mendes Award===
The U.S. environmental group, Sierra Club, created a special award in 1989 named after Mendes. It was established to recognize &quot;individuals or nongovernmental organizations outside the United States that have exhibited extraordinary courage and leadership in the universal struggle to protect the environment.&quot; The first award was presented that year jointly to Brazilian Kayapo Indians Paulinho Paiakan and Kuben-I Kayapo and to American anthropologist Darrell A. Posey, all of whom had worked together to protect the Kayapo homeland from logging and dam-building.

===Namesake species===
* A species of bird, Chico&#x27;s tyrannulet (&quot;Zimmerius chicomendesi&quot;), was named after Mendes in 2013.
* &quot;Chicomendes&quot;, a monotypic genus of flowering vines, was named after Mendes in 2021.

=== The Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve ===
Following his death, the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve was created on 12 March 1990 with the intention of maintaining sustainability of resources within the Amazon forests. The Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve is the largest extractive reserve within the Amazon, covering nearly one million hectares of land. Its creation marked a shift for reserves within the Amazon, after which many other extractive reserves were established. They now account for approximately 13% of the Amazon&#x27;s total area.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="441309" wikidata="Q6759424" url="?curid=441309" title="Margaret Frazer">
<text>Margaret Frazer, born Gail Lynn Brown (November 26, 1946 – February 4, 2013), was an American historical novelist, best known for more than twenty historical mystery novels and a variety of short stories. The pen name was originally shared by Frazer and Mary Monica Pulver Kuhfeld in their collaboration on &quot;The Novice&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the first of the &quot;Sister Frevisse&quot; books featuring the Benedictine nun Dame Frevisse. Their collaboration came to an end with &quot;The Murderer&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the sixth book in the series. Starting with the Edgar Award-nominated &quot;The Prioress&#x27; Tale&quot;, the Margaret Frazer pen name was used exclusively by Gail Brown. She also wrote the &quot;Player Joliffe&quot; mysteries, starring the medieval actor Joliffe.

Frazer was born and grew up in Kewanee, Illinois. An actress and member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, she lived and worked in Elk River, Minnesota. Frazer died on February 4, 2013, from breast cancer, aged 66.

==Overview==
The first six &quot;Dame Frevisse&quot; mysteries were written as a collaborative effort between Frazer and Mary Monica Pulver Kuhfeld. The rest of the series was written by Margaret Frazer alone. Frevisse is a nun at the small, fictional, 15th-century Oxfordshire convent of St. Frideswide&#x27;s, with its ten (more or less) nuns; the neighboring village of Prior Byfield belongs partly to the priory and partly to Lord Lovell (an historical figure). Six of the novels are set entirely at the priory and/or village; in others Frevisse leaves the convent, either to accompany another nun on some family or convent business or on business of her own. Many of the novels have the quality of &quot;English village&quot; murder mysteries, in which we see at close hand the everyday material life (and the intellectual and spiritual life) of various classes of people and observe the tensions within and between them; but here, the &quot;everyday&quot; is of the 15th century, carefully researched. Some of the later novels are primarily historical novels, in which Frevisse serves as an observer of the well-documented events and characters which brought on the Wars of the Roses, though there is always a murder for her to solve.

Dame Frevisse is related to Geoffrey Chaucer, author of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, by her aunt&#x27;s marriage to Geoffrey&#x27;s son, Thomas Chaucer. Titles of the Frevisse novels follow the format of Chaucer&#x27;s Canterbury Tales, e.g., &quot;The Novice&#x27;s Tale,&quot; &quot;The Prioress&#x27;s Tale.&quot; There is no relation between Frazer&#x27;s title characters and Chaucer&#x27;s, even when they have the same role in life (e.g. Chaucer&#x27;s Prioress is a dainty, sentimental woman while Frazer&#x27;s is an ambitious, domineering one). However, there is the same implication that we are offered a variety of points of view. Each book begins with a chapter or passage focusing on the title character; this is followed by a change to Frevisse&#x27;s perspective, which dominates the novel, though we return from time to time to the point of view of the title character. The role of the title character varies from book to book: murderer, victim, a person in power or a victim of others’ power. Seven of the title characters in the Dame Frevisse mysteries have been women.

The novels of the series are set from 1431 to 1452, during the reign of Henry VI of England; they overlap William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI, part 1&quot; and &quot;Henry VI, part 2&quot;. They proceed in chronological sequence, and the heroine ages from a thirtyish nun in 1431 through the next twenty years. In the early novels, Frevisse&#x27;s uncle (by marriage) Thomas Chaucer, son of the poet, provides a contact point with historical events as he brings news of the world to St. Frideswide&#x27;s; at his funeral (&quot;The Bishop’s Tale&quot;), Frevisse establishes a relationship with her cousin Alice Chaucer, who is, in her third marriage, united to William de la Pole, count/marquis/duke (as the novels progress) of Suffolk, one of the most ambitious men around the king. In the same novel, Frevisse also impresses Bishop Beaufort, one of the most powerful men in the country. Out of these relationships come various missions in which Frevisse must assist Alice, Beaufort, or both in protecting various interests at the royal court. A character who occasionally appears is Joliffe, a man with a mysterious past.

Frazer&#x27;s second set of mysteries, also set in 15th-century England, feature &quot;Joliffe the Player&quot;, a spin-off character from the Dame Frevisse series, appearing first in &quot;The Servant&#x27;s Tale&quot; and crossing paths with Frevisse again in &quot;The Prioress&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Bastard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Traitor&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The Joliffe series is set in the mid-1430s; thus these novels sometimes feel like &quot;prequels&quot; to his appearances in Dame Frevisse novels set in a later decade.

The first three Joliffe novels present the life of an acting troupe traveling through the English countryside, with Lord Lovell as their patron after the end of the first novel. In the fourth, &quot;A Play of Lords&quot;, Joliffe is recruited as a spy for Bishop Beaufort and becomes involved in the political intrigues leading up to the Wars of the Roses. The fifth book, &quot;A Play of Treachery,&quot; takes him away from the players to France on behalf of Bishop Beaufort. When Joliffe again crosses paths with Dame Frevisse in &quot;The Traitor&#x27;s Tale&quot;, he is employed as a spy for the Duke of York, after the death of Bishop Beaufort.

The sixth Joliffe mystery, &quot;A Play of Piety&quot;, is set in an English hospital where the actors&#x27; troupe has taken refuge. In this setting, strong personalities contend: women against the men who are supposedly in charge; a female &quot;medica&quot; or herbalist versus the male physician; and a toxic narcissist against everyone else. Playing the atypical role of a servant to the nursing sisters who run the hospital in open defiance of those who would dominate them, Joliffe solves the mystery.

Margaret Frazer was a Herodotus award winner, two-time Minnesota Book Awards nominee, and two-time Edgar award finalist.

<doc id="441311" wikidata="Q327758" url="?curid=441311" title="Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke">
<text>Prince Eugen of Sweden and Norway, Duke of Närke (Eugen Napoleon Nicolaus; 1 August 1865 – 17 August 1947) was a Swedish painter, art collector, and patron of artists.

== Background ==
Prince Eugen was born at Drottningholm Palace as the fourth and youngest son of Prince Oscar, Duke of Östergötland. His mother was Sophia of Nassau. The newborn prince was granted the title of Duke of Närke. Upon his father&#x27;s accession to the thrones of Sweden and Norway as King Oscar II, the Duke of Närke became fourth in line to the throne. Showing early artistic promise, he studied in Paris, and went on to become one of Sweden&#x27;s most prominent landscape painters. Throughout his life Prince Eugen was a supporter of fellow artists, and also involved in many cultural organisations and committees. A homosexual bachelor, he bequeathed his villa Waldemarsudde at Djurgården in Stockholm, and its collections, to the nation. It is now one of Sweden&#x27;s most popular museums.

== Norway ==
The Duke of Närke was a great admirer of Norwegian nature and frequently visited Christiania (later known as Oslo). His letters show that he preferred its artistic milieu to the more constrained Stockholm one. His most notable Norwegian friends were the painters Erik Werenskiold and Gerhard Munthe; he remained attached to them and to Norway until his death.

In 1905, the personal union between Norway and Sweden was broken by the Parliament of Norway. The writer Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson mentioned the possible candidature of Prince Eugen for the throne of Norway. Another writer, Knut Hamsun, had suggested the Prince as a suitable candidate already in 1893. His father, however, refused to allow any of his sons to ascend the Norwegian throne.

Prince Eugen was the only Swede represented at an exhibition in Oslo in 1904. The explanation was that he was a prince of Norway until 1905 and that his relations with the Norwegian artists caused him to be seen as Norwegian until the dissolution of the union.

== Art ==
After finishing high school, Prince Eugen studied art history at Uppsala University. Although supported by his parents, Prince Eugen did not make the decision to pursue a career in painting easily, not least because of his royal status. He was very open-minded and interested in the radical tendencies of the 1880s. He was first trained in painting by Hans Gude and Wilhelm von Gegerfelt.

Between 1887 and 1889, he studied in Paris under Léon Bonnat, Alfred Philippe Roll, Henri Gervex and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. When he arrived, the Finnish artist Albert Edelfelt became his cicerone in the studios and at the exhibitions in Paris - a close friendship between Eugene and Edelfelt arose. Puvis de Chavannes&#x27;s classical simplicity had the greatest influence on Prince Eugen&#x27;s work. The Duke devoted himself entirely to landscape painting, becoming one of the era&#x27;s most prominent landscape painters. He was mainly interested in the lake Mälaren, the countryside of Stockholm (such as Tyresö, where he spent his summers), Västergötland (most notably Örgården, another summer residence) and Skåne (especially Österlen).

===Prince Eugen&#x27;s works===
== Death and legacy ==
Prince Eugen bought Waldemarsudde, in Djurgården in Stockholm, in 1899 and had a residence built there within a few years. After his death at Drottningholm Palace on 17 August 1947, the residence became an art museum and, in accordance with his will, property of the state. Eugen never married, in an era when royal princes almost always found princesses to wed. His homosexual orientation was unknown to the general public.

<doc id="441315" wikidata="Q1127709" url="?curid=441315" title="True Romance">
<text>True Romance is a 1993 American romantic crime film directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino. It features an ensemble cast led by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, with Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, and Christopher Walken in supporting roles. Slater and Arquette portray newlyweds on the run from the Mafia after stealing a shipment of drugs.

&quot;True Romance&quot; began life as an early script by Tarantino; he sold the screenplay in order to finance his debut feature film, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992). It is regarded by proponents as a cross-section of writer Tarantino and director Scott&#x27;s respective trademarks, including a Southern California setting, pop cultural references, and stylized violence punctuated by slow motion.

Though initially a box-office failure, the film&#x27;s positive reviews, with critics praising the dialogue, characters, and offbeat style, helped it earn a cult following. It has come to be considered one of Scott&#x27;s best films and one of the best American films of the 1990s.

==Plot==
At a Detroit theater showing kung fu films, Alabama Whitman strikes up a conversation with Elvis Presley fanatic Clarence Worley. They later have sex at his downtown apartment. Alabama tearfully confesses that she is a call girl hired by Clarence&#x27;s boss as a birthday present but has fallen in love with him. The two get married the next day at City Hall. An apparition of Elvis visits Clarence and convinces him to kill Alabama&#x27;s abusive pimp, Drexl Spivey. Going to the brothel where Alabama worked, he shoots and kills Drexl and takes a bag he assumes contains Alabama&#x27;s belongings. Back at the apartment, he and Alabama discover it contains a large amount of cocaine that Drexl had stolen from two drug pushers.

The couple visits Clarence&#x27;s estranged father Clifford, a retired police officer, for help. He tells Clarence the police assume Drexl&#x27;s murder is a gang killing committed in revenge for the murdered dealers. After the couple leave for Los Angeles, Clifford is interrogated by Vincenzo Coccotti, &quot;consigliere&quot; to mobster &quot;Blue Lou Boyle&quot;, who had hired Drexl to steal and distribute the cocaine on his behalf. He reveals that the mob knows about Clarence&#x27;s theft since they found his driver&#x27;s license near Drexl&#x27;s body. Clifford, realizing he will die anyway, mockingly defies Coccotti, who shoots him dead. One of his men then finds a Los Angeles address taped to Clifford&#x27;s refrigerator.

In Los Angeles, Clarence and Alabama meet Clarence&#x27;s aspiring actor friend, Dick Ritchie, who introduces him to actor and production assistant Elliot Blitzer. He reluctantly agrees to broker the sale of the drugs to his boss, film producer Lee Donowitz. While Clarence is out buying lunch, Coccotti&#x27;s enforcer Virgil finds Alabama in her motel room and beats her for information. Alabama fights back, stabbing him with a corkscrew, putting nail polish remover in his eyes and using hairspray to set fire to Virgil&#x27;s face before grabbing his sawed-off shotgun and shooting him to death in a maniacal rage. Clarence tends to Alabama&#x27;s wounds, and they discuss their future together.

Elliot is pulled over for speeding and gets charged when his mistress hits him with a bag of cocaine and spills it on him. To stay out of jail, he agrees to wear a wire and record the drug deal between Clarence and Donowitz for police detectives Dimes and Nicholson. Coccotti&#x27;s men also learn about where the deal will take place from Dick&#x27;s stoner roommate Floyd. Clarence, Alabama, Dick, and Elliot go to Donowitz&#x27;s suite at the Ambassador Hotel with the drugs. In the elevator, a suspicious Clarence threatens Elliot at gunpoint but is persuaded by Elliot&#x27;s pleading for mercy.

Clarence fabricates a story for Donowitz that the drugs were given to him by a corrupt police officer, and he agrees to the sale. Excusing himself to the bathroom, the vision of Elvis reassures him that things are going well. Donowitz and his bodyguards are ambushed by the police and the mobsters. Elliot reveals himself to be an informant by asking the officers if he could leave, whereupon a shootout erupts. Dick throws the suitcase of drugs into the air, where it gets shredded by gunfire, and flees. Donowitz, his bodyguards, Elliot, the officers, and the mobsters are all killed, and Clarence is wounded as he exits the bathroom. He and Alabama escape with Donowitz&#x27;s money as more police arrive. They flee to Mexico, where Alabama gives birth to a son, whom they name Elvis.

==Cast==
Additionally, Arquette&#x27;s son Enzo Rossi plays Elvis in the final scene of the film.

==Production==
The title and plot are a play on the titles of romance comic books such as &quot;True Life Secrets&quot;, &quot;True Stories of Romance&quot;, &quot;Romance Tales&quot;, &quot;Untamed Love&quot; and &quot;Strange Love&quot;.

The film was a breakthrough for Quentin Tarantino. Released after &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, it was his first screenplay for a major motion picture, and Tarantino contends that it is his most autobiographical film to date. He had hoped to direct the film, but lost interest in directing and sold the script. According to Tarantino&#x27;s audio commentary on the DVD release, he was happy with the way it turned out. Apart from changing the nonlinear narrative he wrote to a more conventional linear structure, it was largely faithful to his original screenplay. He initially opposed director Tony Scott&#x27;s decision to change the ending (which Scott maintained was of his own volition, not the studio&#x27;s, saying &quot;I just fell in love with these two characters and didn&#x27;t want to see them die&quot;). When seeing the completed film, he realized Scott&#x27;s happy ending was more appropriate to the film as Scott directed it. The film&#x27;s first act, as well as some fragments of dialogue, were repurposed from Tarantino&#x27;s 1987 amateur film &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Birthday&quot;.

The film&#x27;s score by Hans Zimmer is a theme based on Gassenhauer from Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Schulwerk&quot;. This theme, combined with a voiceover spoken by Arquette, is an homage to Terrence Malick&#x27;s 1973 crime film &quot;Badlands&quot;, in which Sissy Spacek speaks the voiceover, and that also shares similar dramatic motifs.

The movie was cut by the United States MPAA for an R rating for its wide theatrical release. The majority of the confrontation between Alabama and Virgil was cut, as well as the ending shootout scene. There was also an alternative edit where Detective Nicky Dimes is shot not by Alabama, but by Toothpick Vic, one of the mafia hitmen. This edit was the official 1993 rental VHS release, but subsequently all DVD and most Blu-ray releases are of the original unrated director&#x27;s cut. The 2022 4K release from Arrow, however, has both cuts of the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Although a critical success, &quot;True Romance&quot; was a box office failure. The film earned $4 million during its opening weekend, ranking in third place behind &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Undercover Blues&quot;. It was given a domestic release and earned $12.3 million on a $12.5 million budget. Despite this, the film developed a cult following over the years.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Fueled by Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s savvy screenplay and a gallery of oddball performances, Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;True Romance&quot; is a funny and violent action jaunt in the best sense.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Phil Villarreal of the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; called it &quot;one of the most dynamic action films of the 1990s&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it three stars, saying &quot;it&#x27;s Tarantino&#x27;s gutter poetry that detonates &quot;True Romance&quot;. This movie is dynamite.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review remarking that &quot;the energy and style of the movie are exhilarating&quot;, and that &quot;the supporting cast is superb, a roll call of actors at home in these violent waters: Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, and Brad Pitt, for example&quot;. A negative review by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;s Richard Harrington claimed the film was &quot;stylistically visceral&quot; yet &quot;aesthetically corrupt&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;True Romance&quot;, a vibrant, grisly, gleefully amoral road movie directed by Tony Scott and dominated by the machismo of Quentin Tarantino (who wrote this screenplay before he directed &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;), is sure to offend a good-sized segment of the moviegoing population&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;True Romance&quot; the 83rd greatest film of all time in 2017, writing: &quot;Tony Scott&#x27;s handling of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s script came off like the cinematic equivalent of cocaine-flavoured bubble-gum: a bright, flavoursome confection that had an intoxicatingly violent kick. It also drew some tremendous big names to its supporting cast.&quot;

The Hopper/Walken scene, colloquially named &quot;The Sicilian scene&quot;, was praised by Oliver Lyttelton of &quot;IndieWire&quot;, who called it &quot;one of the most beautiful s in contemporary cinema, wonderfully written and made utterly iconic by the two virtuoso actors&quot;. Tarantino himself has named it as one of his proudest moments. &quot;I had heard that whole speech about the Sicilians a long time ago, from a black guy living in my house. One day I was talking with a friend who was Sicilian and I just started telling that speech. And I thought: &#x27;Wow, that is a great scene, I gotta remember that&#x27;.&quot;

Oldman&#x27;s villain also garnered acclaim. MSN Movies wrote: &quot;With just a few minutes of screen time, Gary Oldman crafts one of cinema&#x27;s most memorable villains: the brutal, dreadlocked pimp Drexl Spivey. Even in a movie jammed with memorable cameos from screen luminaries [...] Oldman&#x27;s scar-faced, dead-eyed, lethal gangster stood out.&quot; Jason Serafino of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine named Spivey as one of the top five coolest drug dealers in movie history, writing: &quot;He&#x27;s not in the film for a long time, but the few scant moments that Gary Oldman plays the psychopathic dealer Drexl Spivey make &quot;True Romance&quot; a classic ... Oldman gave us a glimpse at one of cinema&#x27;s most unfiltered sociopaths.&quot; &quot;Maxim&quot; journalist Thomas Freeman ranked Spivey as the greatest performance of Oldman&#x27;s career.

&quot;Robbers&quot;, a song by the English indie rock band the 1975 from their 2013 debut album, was inspired by the film. Vocalist Matthew Healy explained: &quot;I got really obsessed with the idea behind Patricia Arquette&#x27;s character in &quot;True Romance&quot; when I was about eighteen. That craving for the bad boy in that film [is] so sexualized.&quot;

&quot;True Romance&quot;, the 2013 debut album from English pop star Charli XCX, was named after the film.

Brad Pitt&#x27;s stoner character in &quot;True Romance&quot;, Floyd, was the inspiration for making the film &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;, according to producer Judd Apatow, who &quot;thought it would be funny to make a movie in which you follow that character out of his apartment and watch him get chased by bad guys&quot;.

James Gandolfini landed his role of Tony Soprano on &quot;The Sopranos&quot; when he was invited to audition for the role after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in &quot;True Romance&quot;. Gandolfini ultimately received the role ahead of several other actors, including Steven Van Zandt and Michael Rispoli.

In the trance song &quot;Solarcoaster&quot; by Solarstone, a sample is used from the film. The sample includes the line spoken by Alabama, &quot;That three words went through my mind endlessly. Repeating themselves like a broken record. You&#x27;re so cool. You&#x27;re so cool. You&#x27;re so cool.&quot;

<text>Frithuswith, commonly Frideswide (; c. 65019 October 727), was an English princess and abbess. She is credited as the foundress of a monastery later incorporated into Christ Church, Oxford. She was the daughter of a sub-king of a Mercia named Dida of Eynsham whose lands occupied western Oxfordshire and the upper reaches of the River Thames.

==Life==

The earliest narrative of the saint is the &quot;Life of Saint Frideswide the Virgin&quot; () preserved in a manuscript from the early twelfth century, copied in the hand of John of Worcester. A longer adaptation of this work is attributed to Robert of Cricklade, head of the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford.

The story recounts that Frideswide was born to King Didan and his wife Safrida. She founds a monastery with her father&#x27;s assistance while still young. Her parents die soon after. Algar, king of Leicester (Æthelbald of Mercia) seeks to marry her in spite of her vow of celibacy. When she refuses him, Algar attempts to abduct her, and Frideswide flees into the wilderness. On fleeing, she finds a ship sent by God which takes her to Bampton, Oxfordshire. Algar searches for her in Oxford, but the people refuse to tell him where she is, and he is struck blind.

Frideswide later seeks greater solitude and migrates to Binsey, Oxfordshire. To avoid having to fetch water from the distant River Thames, she prays to God and a well springs up. The well water has healing properties and many people come to seek it out. A nineteenth-century reconstruction of this well can be found at the Church of Saint Margaret in Binsey. She later returns to Oxford and remains abbess until her death.

Two Middle English adaptations of the Life of Frideswide are included in the &quot;South English legendaries&quot;. These include several minor variants on the narrative.

==The priory==

St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory, a medieval Augustinian house (some of the buildings of which were incorporated into Christ Church, Oxford following the dissolution of the monasteries) is claimed to be the site of her abbey and relics. From early times the abbey appears to have been an important landowner in the area; however, it was destroyed in 1002 during the events of the St. Brice&#x27;s Day massacre. A shrine was kept at the abbey in Frithuswith&#x27;s honour; later a monastery was built there for Augustinian canons.

In 1180, the Archbishop of Canterbury Richard of Dover translated Frithuswith&#x27;s remains to a new shrine in the monastery church, an event that was attended by King Henry II of England. The later history of the monastery was chequered, but it remained sufficiently prominent that Catherine of Aragon visited the shrine during her final pregnancy.

The priory seal, designed in the late 1180s, depicts Frideswide with a lily and a set of wax tablets.

Henry Chichele, the archbishop of Canterbury, officially declared Frideswide the patron saint of Oxford and the University of Oxford in 1440. Her feast day is 19 October, the traditional day of her death; the date of her translation is commemorated on 12 February; and the invention (discovery) of her relics on 15 May.

The shrine was repeatedly vandalized during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and beyond. In 1546 the monastery church became (and still remains) the cathedral church for the diocese of Oxford. Her shrine was reinstated by Queen Mary in 1558, but was later desecrated by James Calfhill, a Calvinist canon of the church, who was intent on suppressing her cult. As a result, Frithuswith&#x27;s remains were mixed with those of Catherine Dammartin, wife of Peter Martyr Vermigli, and they remain so to this day.

==In modern tradition==
Frideswide remains the patron saint of Oxford and its university, and there is a revived tradition of pilgrimages to Christ Church. In later art, she is depicted holding the pastoral staff of an abbess with a fountain springing up near her and an ox at her feet. She appears in medieval stained glass, and in Pre-Raphaelite stained glass by Edward Burne-Jones in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, in the chapel where her shrine is also located.

<text>Simon Walter Blackburn (born 12 July 1944) is an English academic philosopher known for his work in metaethics, where he defends quasi-realism, and in the philosophy of language. More recently, he has gained a large general audience from his efforts to popularise philosophy. He has appeared in multiple episodes of the documentary series &quot;Closer to Truth&quot;. During his long career, he has taught at Oxford University, Cambridge University, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

==Life and career==
Blackburn was born on 12 July 1944 in Chipping Sodbury, England. He attended Clifton College and went on to receive his bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 1965 from Trinity College, Cambridge. He obtained his doctorate in 1969 from Churchill College, Cambridge.

He retired as the professor of philosophy at the University of Cambridge in 2011, but remains a distinguished research professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, teaching every fall semester. He is also a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a member of the professoriate of New College of the Humanities. He was previously a Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford and has also taught full-time at the University of North Carolina as an Edna J. Koury Professor. He is a former president of the Aristotelian Society, having served the 2009–2010 term. In 2004, he delivered the Gifford Lectures on &quot;Reason&#x27;s Empire&quot; at the University of Glasgow. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2002 and a Foreign Honorary Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences in 2008.

He is a former editor of the journal &quot;Mind&quot;.

==Philosophical work==
In philosophy, he is best known as the proponent of quasi-realism in meta-ethics and as a defender of neo-Humean views on a variety of topics. &quot;The quasi-realist is someone who endorses an anti-realist metaphysical stance but who seeks, through philosophical maneuvering, to earn the right for moral discourse to enjoy all the trappings of realist talk.&quot;

In 2008 &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy&quot;, which was authored by Blackburn, was published.

In 2014 Blackburn published &quot;Mirror, Mirror: The Uses and Abuses of Self-Love&quot;, focusing on different philosophical aspects of self-love, discussing modern forms and manifestations of pride, amour-propre, integrity or self-esteem through various philosophical frameworks and ideas.

==Public philosophy==

He makes occasional appearances in the British media, such as on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Moral Maze&quot;.

He is a patron of Humanists UK (formerly the British Humanist Association), and when asked to define his atheism, he said he prefers the label &quot;infidel&quot; over &quot;atheist&quot;:
He was one of 55 public figures to sign an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in September 2010, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK, and has argued that &quot;religionists&quot; should have less influence in political affairs.

He was one of 240 academics to sign a letter to the Equality and Human Rights Commission opposing &#x27;radical gender orthodoxy&#x27;, published in The Sunday Times.

In a televised debate, Blackburn argued against the position of the author and podcaster Sam Harris that morality can be derived straightforwardly from science.

<text>Juan Bautista Quirós Segura (January 18, 1853 – November 7, 1934) was president of Costa Rica for two weeks, from August 12 to September 2, 1919, following the resignation of Federico Tinoco. His government was not recognized by the United States and he was forced to resign.

== Family and early life ==

Juan Bautista Quirós Segura was born in San Juan de Tibás, Costa Rica on January 18, 1853, to his parents General Pablo Quirós Jiménez and Mercedes Segura Masís. He first married Teresa Aguilar Guzmán (who died in 1899), granddaughter of then head of state Manuel Aguilar Chacón, and on November 4, 1900, he married Clementina Quirós Fonseca (1880–1953), daughter of José Quirós Montero and Florinda Fonseca Guzmán.

== Military and private activities ==

He pursued a military career and achieved the rank of General in the Costa Rican army. He was also a farmer and entrepreneur, and eventually earned a large capital.

== First public offices ==

During Rafael Yglesias Castro&#x27;s second administration he was designated second in line to the presidency and secretary of commerce, war, and navy as well as treasurer.

He later served as deputy, third in line to the presidency, president of the Constitutional Congress, and president of the International Bank of Costa Rica. On August 19, 1919, President Federico Tinoco&#x27;s fall seemed imminent, Congress named him first in line to the presidency. On August 12, President Tinoco asked him to temporarily hold the office. His first orders were to reestablish all public liberties and to free all political prisoners.

== President of the Republic ==

He officially took office on August 20, 1919, after Federico Tinoco&#x27;s resignation was accepted. His period was scheduled to end on May 8, 1923, but, even though his government took a very prudent approach, the United States government refused to recognize him as a legitimate head of state. Being faced with a possible armed intervention, Quirós decided to quit the office and on September 20 was replaced by Francisco Aguilar Barquero.

== Other public offices ==

He was briefly secretary of war under President Aguilar. During Julio Acosta García&#x27;s administration, and by Acosta&#x27;s own recommendation, Congress designated him as the first head of the Control Office, which was in charge of government internal control.

He died in San José on November 7, 1934.

<doc id="441346" wikidata="Q695239" url="?curid=441346" title="Ben Shahn">
<text>Ben Shahn (September 12, 1898 – March 14, 1969) was an American artist. He is best known for his works of social realism, his left-wing political views, and his series of lectures published as &quot;The Shape of Content&quot;.

==Biography==
Shahn was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire, to Jewish parents Joshua Hessel and Gittel (Lieberman) Shan. His father was exiled to Siberia for possible revolutionary activities in 1902, at which point Shahn, his mother, and two younger siblings moved to Vilkomir (Ukmergė). In 1906, the family immigrated to the United States where they rejoined Hessel, a carpenter, who had fled Siberia and emigrated to the US by way of South Africa. They settled in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, where two more siblings were born. His younger brother drowned at age 17. Shahn began his art career in New York, where he was first trained as a lithographer. Shahn&#x27;s early experiences with lithography and graphic design are apparent in his later prints and paintings which often include the combination of text and image. Shahn&#x27;s primary medium was egg tempera, popular among social realists.

Although Shahn attended New York University as a biology student in 1919, he went on to pursue art at City College in 1921 and then at the National Academy of Design. After his marriage to Tillie Goldstein in 1924, the two traveled through North Africa and then to Europe, where he made &quot;the traditional artist pilgrimage.&quot; There he studied great European artists such as Henri Matisse, Raoul Dufy, Georges Rouault, Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee. Contemporaries who would make a profound impact on Shahn&#x27;s work and career include artists Walker Evans, Diego Rivera and Jean Charlot.

Shahn was dissatisfied with the work inspired by his travels, claiming that the pieces were unoriginal. He eventually outgrew his pursuit of European modern art, and redirected his efforts toward a realist style which he used to contribute to social dialogue.

The 23 gouache paintings of the trials of Sacco and Vanzetti communicated the political concerns of his time, rejecting academic prescriptions for subject matter. &quot;The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti&quot; was exhibited in 1932 and received acclaim from both the public and critics. This series gave Shahn the confidence to cultivate his personal style, regardless of society’s art standards.

==Work during the Great Depression==

Shahn&#x27;s subsequent series of California labor leader Tom Mooney won him the recognition of Diego Rivera. In May and June 1933, he served as an assistant to Diego Rivera while Rivera executed the Rockefeller Center mural. Shahn had a role in fanning the controversy, by circulating a petition among the workers. Also during this period, Shahn met photojournalist Bernarda Bryson, who would later become his second wife. Although this marriage was successful, the mural, his 1934 project for the Public Works of Art Project and proposal for the Municipal Art Commission were all failures. Fortunately, in 1935, Shahn was recommended by Walker Evans, a friend and former roommate, to Roy Stryker to join the photographic group at the Resettlement Administration (RA). As a member of the group, Shahn roamed and documented the American south together with his colleagues Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange. Like his earlier photography of New York City, Shahn&#x27;s photography for the RA and its successor, the Farm Security Administration, can be viewed as social-documentary. Similarly, Shahn’s New Deal art for the RA and FSA exposed American living and working conditions. He also worked for these agencies as a graphic artist and painter. Shahn&#x27;s fresco mural for the school of Jersey Homesteads is among his most famous works, but the government also hired Shahn to execute the Bronx Central Annex Post Office (1939) and Social Security (1942) murals. For the 10 panels of &quot;The Meaning of Social Security&quot; mural at the Social Security Administration Building, Shahn was assisted by John Ormai; it is presently cared for by the GSA Fine Art Collection. In 1939, Shahn and his wife produced a set of 13 murals inspired by Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;I See America Working&quot; and installed at the Bronx Central Annex Post Office. Curator Susan Edwards recognizes the influence of this art on the public consciousness, writing, &quot;The Roosevelt administration believed [such] images were useful for persuading not only voters but members of Congress to support federal relief and recovery programs … The art he made for the federal government affirms both his own legacy and that of the New Deal.&quot;

==World War II and beyond==

During the war years of 1942–43, Shahn worked for the Office of War Information (OWI), but his pieces lacked the preferred patriotism of the day and only two of his posters were published. His art&#x27;s anti-war sentiment found other forms of expression in a series of paintings from 1944 to 1945, such as &quot;Death on the Beach&quot;, which depicts the desolation and loneliness of war. In 1945 he painted &quot;Liberation&quot; about the Liberation of Paris which depicts children playing in the rubble.
He also did a series, called &quot;Lucky Dragon&quot;, about the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; (literally, &quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5&quot;), the Japanese fishing boat caught in the Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb blast. As of 2012, an important part of this series is in the collections of Fukushima Prefectural Museum of Art.

In 1947 he directed a summer session of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

Edward Steichen selected Shahn&#x27;s work, including his October 1935 photograph &quot;The family of a Resettlement Administration client in the doorway of their home, Boone County, Arkansas&quot;, for MoMA&#x27;s world-touring The Family of Man which was seen by 9 million visitors. Only the huddled figure of the woman on the right hand half of Shahn&#x27;s 35mm frame was blown up for the display.

From 1961 to 1967, Shahn worked on the stained glass at Temple Beth Zion, a Buffalo, NY synagogue designed by Harrison &amp; Abramovitz.

Shahn also began to act as a commercial artist for CBS, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;. His portrait of Martin Luther King Jr. appeared on the 19 March 1965 cover of &quot;Time&quot;. Despite Shahn&#x27;s growing popularity, he only accepted commissions which he felt were of personal or social value. By the mid-1950s, Shahn&#x27;s accomplishments had reached such a height that he was sent, along with Willem de Kooning, to represent the United States at the 1954 Venice Biennale. He was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the Academia dell&#x27; Arte e del Disegno in Florence. The Art Directors Club Hall of Fame recognizes him as &quot;one of the greatest masters of the twentieth century. Honors, books, and gallery retrospectives continue to rekindle interest in his work...years after his death.&quot;

The artist was especially active as an academic in the last two decades of his life. He received honorary doctorates from Princeton University and Harvard University, and joined Harvard as a Charles Eliot Norton professor in 1956. His published writings, including &quot;The Biography of Painting&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Shape of Content&quot; (1957), became influential works in the art world.

After his death, William Schuman composed &quot;In Praise of Shahn&quot;, a modern canticle for orchestra, first performed January 29, 1970, by the New York Philharmonic, Leonard Bernstein conducting.

==Themes==

Ben Shahn’s social-realist vision informed his approach to art. Shahn’s examination of the status quo inspired his creative process. Although he often explored polemic themes of modern urban life, organized labor, immigration and injustice, he did so while maintaining a compassionate tone. Shahn identified himself as a communicative artist. He challenged the esoteric pretensions of art, which he believed disconnect artists and their work from the public. As an alternative, he proposed an intimate and mutually beneficial relationship between artist and audience.

Shahn defended his choice to employ pictorial realities, rather than abstract forms. According to Shahn, known forms allow the artist &quot;to discover new truths about man and to reaffirm that his life is significant.&quot; References to allegory, the Torah, humanistic content, childhood, science, music and the commonplace are other motifs Shahn draws upon to make the universal personal for his viewers. Wit, candor and sentimentality give his images poignancy. By evoking dynamism, Shahn intended to inspire social change. Shahn stressed that in art, as in life, the combination of opposing orders is vital for progress. His hope for a unity among the diverse peoples of the United States relates to his interest in fusing different visual vocabularies.

==Style==
Shahn mixed different genres of art. His body of art is distinctive for its lack of traditional landscapes, still lifes, and portraits. Shahn used both expressive and precise visual languages, which he united through the consistency of his authoritative line. His background in lithography contributed to his devotion to detail. Shahn is also noted for his use of unique symbolism, which is often compared to the imagery in Paul Klee&#x27;s drawings. While Shahn&#x27;s &quot;love for exactitude&quot; is apparent in his graphics, so too is his creativity. In fact, many of his paintings are inventive adaptations of his photography.

Evocative juxtapositions characterize his aesthetic. He intentionally paired contrasting scales, colors, and images together to create tension. One signature example is seen in his play between industrial coolness and warm human portrayals. &quot;Handball&quot; demonstrates his &quot;use of architectural settings as both psychological foil to human figures and as expressive abstract pattern,&quot; and is also an example of his use of photographs as source material. His c.1933 untitled Gelatin silver print held in the Fogg Art Museum (Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Gift of Mrs. Bernarda B. Shahn) of handball players was made around 1933 just after he took up photography and before his period as a FSA photographer. It has striking symmetry rarely achieved amongst the random events of the street. To make the painting of the scene six years later, Shahn transcribed the positions of the handball players including the photographic accident of a tensed arm and leg that appears to sprout from the bomber jacket of the man at left, but he spreads the men away from each other and expands the frame to break the symmetry and to include a brownstone building over the top of the wall, and to encompass also a billboard at left. Gestures and poses are exaggerated and a hand is added to the figure at right which is cropped in the photograph. The line markings on the wall are made to converge to further stretch the space. In a 1957 interview, Shahn described his painting as being about “social relationships”.

Shahn&#x27;s art is striking but also introspective. He often captured figures engrossed in their own worlds. Many of his photographs were taken spontaneously, without the subject&#x27;s notice. To achieve these candid shots Shahn often used a right-angle viewfinder on his 35mm Leica; he can be seen using it in a window reflection in an untitled picture from his 1938 series made in Circleville, Ohio. Although he used many mediums, his pieces are consistently thoughtful and playful.

==Jersey Homesteads mural==


The Resettlement Administration employed Shahn to paint a mural for the school of Jersey Homesteads (later renamed Roosevelt), a New Jersey town initially planned to be a community for Jewish garment workers. Shahn&#x27;s move to the settlement demonstrates his dedication to the project as does his mural&#x27;s compelling depiction of the town&#x27;s founding.

Three panels compose the mural. According to art historian Diana L. Linden, the panels&#x27; sequence relates to that of the Haggadah, the Jewish Passover Seder text which follows a narrative of slavery, deliverance and redemption. More specifically, Shahn’s mural depicts immigrants&#x27; struggle and advancement in the United States.

The first panel shows the antisemitic and xenophobic obstacles American immigrants faced. During the global Depression, citizens of the United States struggled for their livelihoods. Because foreigners represented competition for employment, they were especially unwelcome. National immigration quotas also reflected the strained foreign relations of the United States at a time when fascism, Nazism, and communism were on the rise. To illustrate the political and social adversary, Shahn incorporated loaded iconography: Nazi soldiers, anti-Jewish signs and the executed Italian anarchists, Sacco and Vanzetti. Below, Shahn&#x27;s mother and Albert Einstein lead immigrants on a gangplank situated by the Ellis Island registry center and the Statue of Liberty. This section demonstrates the immigrants&#x27; heroic emergence in the United States.

The middle panel describes the poor living conditions awaiting immigrants after their arrival. On the right, Shahn depicts the inhuman labor situation in the form of &quot;lightless sweatshops ... tedious and backbreaking work with outmoded tools.&quot; The crowd in the center of the composition represents labor unions and workers&#x27; reform efforts. Here, a figure resembling labor leader John L. Lewis protests in front of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, where a devastating fire occurred and the movement for the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) began. The lower right passageway marked ILGWU symbolizes a new and hopeful path, in the United States, paved by unionized labor.

In the last panel, the unions and the New Deal unite to create the blueprint for the town of the Jersey Homesteads. Various figures of social progress such as Sidney Hillman and Heywood Broun gather around the drafting table. Above them are images of the purposed cooperative farm and factory along with a campaign poster of Roosevelt, after whom the town was eventually named.

Shahn’s biographer Soby notes &quot;the composition of the mural at Roosevelt follows the undulant principle Shahn had learned from Diego Rivera: deep recession of space alternating with human and architectural details projected forward.&quot; Moreover, the montage effectively intimates the amalgamation of peoples and cultures populating the urban landscape in the early 20th century. Multiple layers and perspectives fuse together to portray a complex industrialized system. Still, the mural maintains a sense of humanity; Shahn gives his figures a monumental quality through volume and scale. The urban architecture does not dwarf the people; instead, they work with the surroundings to build their own structure. Shahn captured the urgency for activism and reform, by showing gestures and mid-steps and freezing all the subjects in motion. This pictorial incorporation of &quot;athletic pose and evocative asymmetry of architectural detail&quot; is a Shahn trademark. While exemplifying his visual and social concerns, the mural characterizes the general issues of Shahn&#x27;s milieu.

The arriccio, sinopia drawings of the fresco for Ben Shahn&#x27;s Jersey Homesteads mural were removed from its original community center location in Roosevelt and is now permanently installed in a custom-designed gallery on the second floor of the United States Post Office and Courthouse at in Camden. The gallery adjoins the adjacent annex, the Mitchell H. Cohen Building and U.S. Courthouse.

<text>The Forest Principles (also Rio Forest Principles, formally the Non-Legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests) is a 1992 document produced at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the &quot;Earth Summit&quot;). It is a non-legally binding document that makes several recommendations for conservation and sustainable development forestry.

At the Earth Summit, the negotiation of the document was complicated by demands by developing nations in the Group of 77 for increased foreign aid in order to pay for the setting aside of forest reserves. Developed nations resisted those demands, and the final document was a compromise.

The FOREST EUROPE process (Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, MCPFE) was started by Strasbourg Conference in 1990 and the Forest Principles were adopted and incorporated into the agenda by Helsinki Conference in 1993. The process covers Pan-European region consisting of 47 signatories (46 European countries and the European Union) that partially overlaps with Montréal Process region (Russia is a signatory of both processes).

As a result of lobbying by the developing country caucus (or Group of 77) in the United Nations, the non-legally binding Forest Principles were established in 1992. These linked the problem of deforestation to third world debt and inadequate technology transfer and stated that the &quot;agreed full incremental cost of achieving benefits associated with forest conservation...should be equitably shared by the international community&quot; (para1(b)). Subsequently, the Group of 77 argued in the 1995 &quot;Intergovernmental Panel on Forests&quot; (IPF) and then the 2001 &quot;Intergovernmental Forum on Forests&quot; (IFF), for affordable access to environmentally sound technologies without the stringency of intellectual property rights; while developed states there rejected demands for a forests fund. 

The expert group created under the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) reported in 2004, but in 2007 developed nations again vetoed language in the principles of the final text which might confirm their legal responsibility under international law to supply finance and environmentally sound technologies to the developing world.

The Montréal Process, also known as the &quot;Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests&quot;, was started in 1994 as a result of the Forest Principles.

<text>Ibero-America (, ) or Iberian America is generally considered to be the region in the Americas comprising countries or territories where Spanish or Portuguese are predominant languages (usually former territories of Spain or Portugal). Spain and Portugal are themselves sometimes included in some Ibero-American diplomatic circles, such as the Ibero-American Summit and the Organization of Ibero-American States. The Organization of Ibero-American States also includes Spanish-speaking Equatorial Guinea, in Central Africa, but not the Portuguese-speaking African countries. The Latin Recording Academy, the organization responsible for the Latin Grammy Awards, also includes Spain and Portugal as well as the Latino population of Canada and the United States in their definition of Ibero-America.

The prefix &quot;Ibero-&quot; and the adjective &quot;Iberian&quot; refer to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, which includes Portugal and Spain. Ibero-America includes all Hispanic American countries in North, Central, and South America plus the Hispanophone Caribbean, as well as Portuguese-speaking Brazil. Ibero-America makes up the overwhelming bulk of and is synonymous with the common definition of Latin America, but is differentiated from the expanded definition of Latin America by the exclusion of the French-speaking country of Haiti, the French overseas departments of French Guiana, Martinique and Guadeloupe, and the French collectivities of Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy, which are sometimes included in a few definitions of Latin America. Belize and Guyana, whose official language is English, and Dutch-speaking Suriname, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten are usually not considered to be either Ibero-American or Latin American.

Since 1991, the Iberoamerican Community of Nations organizes a yearly Ibero-American Summit meeting of the heads of state and governments of the Ibero-American countries, including Spain, Portugal and Andorra, this has since changed to biannually from 2014.

<doc id="441353" wikidata="Q1291269" url="?curid=441353" title="Education for Death">
<text>Education for Death: The Making of the Nazi is an American animated anti-Nazi propaganda short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released on January 15, 1943, by RKO Radio Pictures, shown in theaters with &quot;Fighting Frontier&quot;. The film is directed by Clyde Geronimi and principally animated by Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, Frank Thomas, and Bill Tytla. The short is based on the non-fiction book of the same name by American author Gregor Ziemer. The film features the story of Hans, a boy born and raised in Nazi Germany, his indoctrination in the Hitlerjugend, and his eventual march to war.

==Plot==
At the beginning of the film, a German couple proves to a Nazi German bureaucrat that they are of pure Aryan blood and agree to give their son, whom they name Hans at the judge&#x27;s approval, as it is not on a list of banned names, into the service of the Führer Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. They are given a copy of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; by the faceless civil servant as a reward for their service to Hitler; their passport contains spaces for 12 more children (a hint that the couple is expected to produce a large family for the Fatherland).

This is followed by the only extended comical section of the cartoon, the tone of which is very light compared to the rest of the film. The audience is told that as Hans grows up, he hears a distorted version of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; depicting Hitler as the knightly prince character rescuing an obese Valkyrie representing Germany, from a wicked witch representing democracy. The narrator sarcastically comments that &quot;the moral of this story seems to be that Hitler got Germany on her feet, climbed onto the saddle, and took her for a ride.&quot; Thanks to this kind of distorted children&#x27;s story, Hans becomes fascinated with Hitler as he and the rest of the younger members of the Hitler Youth give the Hitler salute to a portrait of Hitler dressed as a knight.

In the following segment, the audience sees Hans sick and bedridden. His mother prays for him, thinking that it will only be a matter of time before the authorities come and take him away to a death camp. A Nazi officer bangs on the door to take Hans away, but his mother says he is sick and needs care. The officer orders her to heal her son quickly and have him ready to leave, implying that if Hans does not get well, he will be euthanized. He orders her not to do anything more to him that will cause him to lose heart and be weak, explaining that a soldier must show no emotion, mercy, or feelings whatsoever.

Hans eventually recovers and resumes his &quot;education&quot; in a school classroom, where Hans and the rest of his classmates, all in Hitlerjugend uniforms, give the Hitler salute to portraits of Hitler, Hermann Göring, and Joseph Goebbels. They then watch as the teacher draws a cartoon on the blackboard of a rabbit being eaten by a fox, prompting Hans to feel sorry for the rabbit. The teacher, furious over the remark, orders Hans to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap, calling him &quot;Dummkopf&quot; (German for &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;feeble-minded&quot;) with his classmates laughing at him. As Hans sits in the corner, he hears the rest of the classmates &quot;correctly&quot; interpret the cartoon as &quot;weakness has no place in a soldier&quot; and &quot;the strong shall rule the weak&quot;, as the teacher asked what does Hans think about the rabbit now, causing him to recant his remark and agree that the weak must be destroyed, much to the teacher&#x27;s approval.

Hans then takes part in a book-burning crusade, burning any books with ideas opposed to Hitler&#x27;s (Albert Einstein, Baruch Spinoza, and Voltaire), replacing the Bible with &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and the crucifix with a Nazi sword. Hans then spends the next several years &quot;Marching and heiling, heiling and marching!&quot; He reaches his teens (wearing a uniform similar to that of the Sturmabteilung) still &quot;marching and heiling&quot; until he becomes an adult or &quot;Good Nazi&quot; (now in Wehrmacht and SS uniform) embroiled in hatred towards anyone else who opposes Hitler. With &quot;no seed of laughter, hope, tolerance, or mercy&quot; planted in him, he &quot;sees no more than the party wants him to [see], says nothing but what the party wants him to say, and he does nothing except what the party wants him to do.&quot;

In the end, Hans and the rest of the German soldiers march off to war only to fade into rows of identical graves, with nothing on them except a swastika and a helmet perched on top. Thus Hans&#x27;s education is complete – &quot;his education... for death&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Education for Death: The Making of the Nazi&quot; was released when Disney was under government contract to produce 32 animated shorts from 1941 to 1945. In 1940, Walt Disney spent four times his budget on the feature film &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940) which suffered from low box office turnout. Nearing bankruptcy and with half of his employees on strike, Walt Disney was forced to look for a solution to bring money into the studio. The studio&#x27;s close proximity to the military aircraft manufacturer, Lockheed, helped foster a U.S. government contract for 32 short propaganda films at $4,500 each. This saved the company from bankruptcy and allowed them to keep their employees on payroll.

The dialogue of the characters is in German, neither subtitled nor directly translated by Art Smith&#x27;s lone English language narration. A voice track of Adolf Hitler in full demagogic rant is used in a torchlight rally scene. A sequence follows in which Hans becomes a German soldier along with other Hitler Youth.

==Home media==
The short was released on May 18, 2004, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Walt Disney on the Front Lines&quot;.

==Relationship to the Ziemer book==
Gregor Ziemer, an American author and educator who lived in Germany from 1928 to 1939, wrote the book &quot;Education for Death&quot; after fleeing Germany on the eve of World War II. The book highlights what was going on in the Nazi schooling of the German youth.

The narrative story focuses around a group of youth that under the guidance of a Nazi storm trooper, Franzen, take a hiking trip into the woods. As night falls, Franzen &quot;lectures the troop on their duty to preserve the purity of the human race, and proposes they symbolize this task with a solemn ritual to &#x27;impress on us all that fire and destruction will be the end of those who do not think as we do&#x27;.&quot; Franzen then hands out six books: the Talmud, the Koran, the works of Shakespeare, the Treaty of Versailles, a biography of Joseph Stalin, and the Bible. The books are passed around the circle and each boy spits on the books, hands them back to Franzen who douses them with kerosene and lights them on fire. The troop then sings the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; (&quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über alles&quot;) and the Horst Wessel anthem around the fire.

The book inspired two different adaptations; &quot;Education for Death&quot; and &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Children&quot;. The former took Ziemer&#x27;s conclusions very seriously, as it showed the education of Hans from an innocent, kind youth into a chained and muzzled Nazi drone. The scene of the storm trooper and the hiking trip is transplanted to a classroom where the teacher instructs the students about nature&#x27;s laws about the strong fox having the right to kill the weak rabbit. When Hans does not agree with the teacher, he is punished until he falls in line. The scene involving the book burning is part of the ending compilation of Nazi transformation and destruction. It shows a torch-bearing crowd setting fire to a pile of books of John Milton, Baruch Spinoza, Albert Einstein, Voltaire, and Thomas Mann. It then shows a burning of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s wedding march, an allusion to the Nazi race laws, and the burning of a pile of art.

<text>Somali ( ; Latin script: ; Wadaad: ; Osmanya: 𐒖𐒍 𐒈𐒝𐒑𐒛𐒐𐒘 ) is an Afroasiatic language belonging to the Cushitic branch. It is spoken primarily in Greater Somalia, and by the Somali diaspora as a mother tongue. Somali is an official language in both Somalia and Ethiopia, and serves as a national language in Djibouti, it is also a recognised minority language in Kenya. The Somali language is officially written with the Latin alphabet although the Arabic script and several Somali scripts like Osmanya, Kaddare and the Borama script are informally used.

==Classification==

Somali is classified within the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family, specifically, Lowland East Cushitic in addition to Afar and Saho. Somali is the best-documented of the Cushitic languages, with academic studies of the language dating back to the late 19th century.

==Geographic distribution of Somali==

The Somali language is spoken in Somali inhabited areas of Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Yemen and by members of the Somali diaspora. It is also spoken as an adoptive language by a few ethnic minority groups and individuals in Somali majority regions.

Somali is the most widely spoken Cushitic language in the region followed by Oromo and Afar.

As of 2021, there are approximately 24 million speakers of Somali, spread in Greater Somalia of which around 17 million reside in Somalia. The language is spoken by an estimated 95% of the country&#x27;s inhabitants, and also by a majority of the population in Djibouti.

Following the start of the Somali Civil War in the early 1990s, the Somali-speaking diaspora increased in size, with newer Somali speech communities forming in parts of the Middle East, North America and Europe.

===Official status===

Constitutionally, Somali and Arabic are the two official languages of Somalia. Somali has been an official national language since January 1973, when the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) declared it the Somali Democratic Republic&#x27;s primary language of administration and education. Somali was thereafter established as the main language of academic instruction in forms 1 through 4, following preparatory work by the government-appointed Somali Language Committee. It later expanded to include all 12 forms in 1979. In 1972, the SRC adopted a Latin orthography as the official national alphabet over several other writing scripts that were then in use. Concurrently, the Italian-language daily newspaper &quot;Stella d&#x27;Ottobre&quot; (&quot;The October Star&quot;) was nationalized, renamed to &quot;Xiddigta Oktoobar&quot;, and began publishing in Somali. The state-run Radio Mogadishu has also broadcast in Somali since 1951. Additionally, other state-run public networks like Somaliland National TV, regional public networks such as Puntland TV and Radio and, as well as Eastern Television Network and Horn Cable Television, among other private broadcasters, air programs in Somali.

Somali is recognized as an official working language in the Somali Region of Ethiopia. Although it is not an official language of Djibouti, it constitutes a major national language there. Somali is used in television and radio broadcasts, with the government-operated Radio Djibouti transmitting programs in the language from 1943 onwards.

The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation also broadcasts in the Somali language in its Iftin FM Programmes. The language is spoken in the Somali territories within North Eastern Kenya, namely Wajir County, Garissa County and Mandera County.

The Somali language is regulated by the Regional Somali Language Academy, an intergovernmental institution established in June 2013 in Djibouti City by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia. It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language.

As of October 2022, Somali and Oromo are the only Cushitic languages available on Google Translate.

==Varieties==
The Somali languages are broadly divided into three main groups: Northern Somali, Benadir and Maay. Northern Somali forms the basis for Standard Somali. It is spoken by the majority of the Somali population with its speech area stretching from Djibouti, and the Somali Region of Ethiopia to the Northern Frontier District. This widespread modern distribution is a result of a long series of southward population movements over the past ten centuries from the Gulf of Aden littoral. Lamberti subdivides Northern Somali into three dialects: Northern Somali proper (spoken in the northwest; he describes this dialect as Northern Somali in the proper sense), the Darod group (spoken in the northeast and along the eastern Ethiopia frontier; greatest number of speakers overall), and the Lower Juba group (spoken by northern Somali settlers in the southern riverine areas).

Benadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the central Indian Ocean seaboard, including Mogadishu. It forms a relatively smaller group. The dialect is fairly mutually intelligible with Northern Somali.
==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===

The language has five basic vowels.

=== Consonants ===
Somali has 22 consonant phonemes.

The retroflex plosive may have an implosive quality for some Somali Bantu speakers, and intervocalically it can be realized as the flap . Some speakers produce with epiglottal trilling as // in retrospect. is often epiglottalized.

The letter is pronounced as a retroflex flap when it occurs intervocalically, as in &quot;qudhaanjo&quot;.

The letter , found in Arabic loanwords, is rarely pronounced as a velar fricative. It is more often conflated with , which is pronounced in syllabic coda position.

=== Tone ===
Pitch is phonemic in Somali, but it is debated whether Somali is a pitch accent, or it is a tonal language. Andrzejewski (1954) posits that Somali is a tonal language, whereas Banti (1988) suggests that it is a pitch system.

=== Phonotactics ===
The syllable structure of Somali is (C)V(C).

Root morphemes usually have a mono- or di-syllabic structure.

Clusters of two consonants do not occur word-initially or word-finally, i.e., they only occur at syllable boundaries. The following consonants can be geminate: /b/, /d/, /ɖ/, /ɡ/, /ɢ/, /m/, /n/, /r/ and /l/. The following cannot be geminate: /t/, /k/ and the fricatives.

Two vowels cannot occur together at syllable boundaries. Epenthetic consonants, e.g. [j] and [ʔ], are therefore inserted.

==Grammar==


===Morphology===
Somali is an agglutinative language, and also shows properties of inflection. Affixes mark many grammatical meanings, including aspect, tense and case.

Somali has an old prefixal verbal inflection restricted to four common verbs, with all other verbs undergoing inflection by more obvious suffixation. This general pattern is similar to the stem alternation that typifies Cairene Arabic.

Somali has two sets of pronouns: independent (substantive, emphatic) pronouns and clitic (verbal) pronouns. The independent pronouns behave grammatically as nouns, and normally occur with the suffixed article -ka/-ta (e.g. &quot;adiga&quot;, &quot;you&quot;). This article may be omitted after a conjunction or focus word. For example, &quot;adna&quot; meaning &quot;and you...&quot; (from &quot;adi&quot;-&quot;na&quot;). Clitic pronouns are attached to the verb and do not take nominal morphology. Somali marks clusivity in the first person plural pronouns; this is also found in a number of other East Cushitic languages, such as Rendille and Dhaasanac.

As in various other Afro-Asiatic languages, Somali is characterized by polarity of gender, whereby plural nouns usually take the opposite gender agreement of their singular forms. For example, the plural of the masculine noun &quot;dibi&quot; (&quot;bull&quot;) is formed by converting it into feminine &quot;dibi&quot;. Somali is unusual among the world&#x27;s languages in that the object is unmarked for case while the subject is marked, though this feature is found in other Cushitic languages such as Oromo.

===Syntax===
Somali is a subject–object–verb (SOV) language. It is largely head final, with postpositions and with obliques preceding verbs. These are common features of the Cushitic and Semitic Afroasiatic languages spoken in the Horn region (e.g. Amharic). However, Somali noun phrases are head-initial, whereby the noun precedes its modifying adjective. This pattern of general head-finality with head-initial noun phrases is also found in other Cushitic languages (e.g. Oromo), but not generally in Ethiopian Semitic languages.

Somali uses three focus markers: &quot;baa&quot;, &quot;ayaa&quot; and &quot;waxa(a)&quot;, which generally mark new information or contrastive emphasis. &quot;Baa&quot; and &quot;ayaa&quot; require the focused element to occur preverbally, while &quot;waxa(a)&quot; may be used following the verb.

==Vocabulary==

Somali loanwords can be divided into those derived from other Afroasiatic languages (mainly Arabic), and those of Indo-European extraction (mainly Italian).

Somali&#x27;s main lexical borrowings come from Arabic, and are estimated to constitute about 20% of the language&#x27;s vocabulary. This is a legacy of the Somali people&#x27;s extensive social, cultural, commercial and religious links and contacts with nearby populations in the Arabian peninsula. Arabic loanwords are most commonly used in religious, administrative and education-related speech (e.g. &quot;aamiin&quot; for &quot;faith in God&quot;), though they are also present in other areas (e.g. &quot;kubbad-da&quot;, &quot;ball&quot;). Soravia (1994) noted a total of 1,436 Arabic loanwords in Agostini a.o. 1985, a prominent 40,000-entry Somali dictionary. Most of the terms consisted of commonly used nouns. These lexical borrowings may have been more extensive in the past since a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini&#x27;s later work. In addition, the majority of personal names are derived from Arabic.

The Somali language also contains a few Indo-European loanwords that were retained from the colonial period. Most of these lexical borrowings come from English and Italian and are used to describe modern concepts (e.g. &quot;telefishen-ka&quot;, &quot;the television&quot;; &quot;raadia-ha&quot;, &quot;the radio&quot;). There are 300 loan words from Italian, such as &quot;garawati&quot; for &quot;tie&quot; (from Italian &#x27;), &quot;dimuqraadi&quot; from &#x27; (democratic), &quot;mikroskoob&quot; from &quot;&quot;, and so on.

Additionally, Somali contains lexical terms from Persian, Urdu and Hindi that were acquired through historical trade with communities in the Near East and South Asia (e.g. &quot;khiyaar&quot; &quot;cucumber&quot; from &quot;khiyār&quot; ). Other loan words have also displaced their native synonyms in some dialects (e.g. &quot;jabaati&quot; &quot;a type of flat bread&quot; from Hindi: चपाती &quot;chapāti&quot; displacing &quot;sabaayad).&quot; Some of these words were also borrowed indirectly via Arabic.

As part of a broader governmental effort of linguistic purism in the Somali language, the past few decades have seen a push in Somalia toward replacement of loanwords in general with their Somali equivalents or neologisms. To this end, the Supreme Revolutionary Council during its tenure officially prohibited the borrowing and use of English and Italian terms.

==Writing system==

Archaeological excavations and research in Somalia uncovered ancient inscriptions in a distinct writing system. In an 1878 report to the Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain, scientist Johann Maria Hildebrandt noted upon visiting the area that &quot;we know from ancient authors that these districts, at present so desert, were formerly populous and civilised[...] I also discovered ancient ruins and rock-inscriptions both in pictures and characters[...] These have hitherto not been deciphered.&quot; According to the 1974 report for Ministry of Information and National Guidance, this script represents the earliest written attestation of Somali.

Much more recently, Somali archaeologist Sada Mire has published ancient inscriptions found throughout Somaliland. As for much of Somali linguistic history the language was not widely used for literature, Dr. Mire&#x27;s publications however prove that writing as a technology was not foreign nor scarce in the region. These pieces of writing are from the Semitic Himyarite and Sabaean languages that were largely spoken in what is modern day Yemen —&quot;there is an extensive and ancient relationship between the people and cultures of both sides of the Red Sea coast&quot; Mire posits. Yet, while many more such ancient inscriptions are yet to be found or analyzed, many have been &quot;bulldozed by developers, as the Ministry of Tourism could not buy the land or stop the destruction&quot;.

Besides Ahmed&#x27;s Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing the Somali language include the long-established Arabic script and Wadaad&#x27;s writing. According to Bogumił Andrzejewski, this usage was limited to Somali clerics and their associates, as sheikhs preferred to write in the liturgical Arabic language. Various such historical manuscripts in Somali nonetheless exist, which mainly consist of Islamic poems (qasidas), recitations and chants. Among these texts are the Somali poems by Sheikh Uways and Sheikh Ismaaciil Faarah. The rest of the existing historical literature in Somali principally consists of translations of documents from Arabic.

Since then a number of writing systems have been used for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the Somali Latin alphabet, officially adopted in 1972, is the most widely used and recognised as official orthography of the state. The script was developed by a number of leading scholars of Somali, including Musa Haji Ismail Galal, B. W. Andrzejewski and Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for transcribing the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except &quot;p&quot;, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. There are no diacritics or other special characters except the use of the apostrophe for the glottal stop, which does not occur word-initially. There are three consonant digraphs: DH, KH and SH. Tone is not marked, and front and back vowels are not distinguished.

Writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the Osmanya, Borama and Kaddare alphabets, which were invented by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur and Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare, respectively.

==Resources==

Several digital collections of texts in the Somali language have been developed in recent decades. These corpora include Kaydka Af Soomaaliga (KAF), Bangiga Af Soomaaliga, the Somali Web Corpus (soWaC), a Somali read-speech corpus, Asaas (Beginning in Somali) and a Web-Based Somali Language Model and text Corpus called Wargeys (Newspaper in Somali).

== Numbers and calendrical terms ==
===Numbers===

For all numbers between 11 &quot;kow iyo toban&quot; and 99 &quot;sagaashal iyo sagaal&quot;, it is equally correct to switch the placement of the numbers, although larger numbers is some dialects prefer to place the 10s numeral first. For example 25 may both be written as &quot;labaatan iyo shan&quot; and &quot;shan iyo labaatan&quot; (lit. Twenty and Five &amp; Five and Twenty).

Although neither the Latin nor Osmanya scripts accommodate this numerical switching.

<text>Allan Vito Flores Caidic (born June 15, 1963) is a Filipino former professional basketball player, coach and executive who is currently serving as consultant for San Sebastian Stags. He is considered by many to be the greatest shooter the country has ever produced, thus, earning the moniker, &quot;The Triggerman&quot;.

He played college hoops at the University of the East before joining the PBA in 1987, where he broke several Philippine and PBA all-time records—including the most points scored in a single game (79 points), the most three-point field goals made in a single game (17 triples; breaking his previous record of 15 triples), the most consecutive freethrows made (76), and the most three-point field goals in a career (1,242 triples; later surpassed by Jimmy Alapag). He has played with several PBA teams and won numerous championships. He played for the Philippine national basketball team including the 1998 Philippine Centennial Team.

While in the league, he was considered one of the best three-point shooters in Asia. The vaunted Chinese national basketball team recognized his ability by always reminding their players to be on the lookout for &quot;Philippine No. 8&quot;, referring to Caidic&#x27;s regular jersey number while playing for the National Team.

==Playing career==

===High school, college and amateur career===
Caidic is from Paete, Laguna and started playing basketball when he was in his fifth grade at Roosevelt College and in the Inter Subdivision Leagues at Brookside in Cainta before trying out for college teams such as the Ateneo Blue Eagles and the Mapua Cardinals but was unsuccessful. He then tried out for the Letran Knights and was accepted. But after realizing that Letran does not have an engineering program, he left. Allan was then taking up Mechanical Engineering. He was later accepted in University of the East (UE) but had to sit out on the reserve list as UE&#x27;s lineup was already complete. Finally in 1981 under coach Roberto Flores, Caidic got his break and delivered well. In a deciding game between the UE Red Warriors and the FEU Tamaraws, Caidic missed two crucial free throws that handed the UAAP championship to the unbeaten Tamaraws. In 1982, he bounced back by leading the Red Warriors to a comeback win against the UP Fighting Maroons in the finals, scoring 30 points to capture the UAAP basketball championship and won the Most Valuable Player award.

In 1983, Caidic was seeded number one in the UAAP one-on-one championships. Unfortunately, he only placed second to UST&#x27;s rookie Silverio Palad. In his final two years, he, along with Jerry Codiñera, led the Red Warriors to back-to-back championships in 1984–1985, the last University of the East basketball team ever to win a championship in the 20th Century. At the same time, he played for several teams in the Philippine Amateur Basketball League while playing for the national team.

He played for several PABL teams such as CF Sharp, ESQ Marketing and the Magnolia Ice Cream/Lagerlite. He also played for commercial teams internationally, notably the Development Bank of Rizal (1983) that finished third in an invitational tournament in Malaysia and the Country Fair Hotdogs in the 1984 William Jones Cup tournament.

===Northern Consolidated National Team===
In 1984–1985, Caidic was part of Danding Cojuangco&#x27;s national basketball development program, which formed a team that represented the Philippines in international competitions, which aimed win the 1986 Asian Basketball Confederation crown (now known as the FIBA Asia Championship) which was last won by the Philippines in 1973.

In the 1985 William Jones Cup, Caidic played in the San Miguel Beer-Philippines&#x27; overtime victory against the US, coached by Gene Keady, in the finals. His shooting mentor, Arthur &quot;Chip&quot; Engelland, scored 43 points while Caidic scored 21, to lead the Filipinos in a 108–100 overtime victory to capture the Jones Cup title. Keady, later, told Ron Jacobs that he had the highest respect for two Filipino cagers whom he called &#x27;Heckle and Jeckle&#x27; (referring to Allan Caidic and Samboy Lim).

He led the Philippines in capturing the 1985 South East Asian Games Gold Medal and in 1986, he led the last all-amateur national team to capture the FIBA Asia Championship gold medal and scored 22 points in an 82–72 win over China in the finals. After winning the Asian Championship, the Philippines qualified for the 1986 FIBA World Championship at Madrid, Spain, but due to the political crisis in the country (that led to the 1986 Philippine People Power EDSA Revolution), the national team did not participate in the tournament.
He is a four-time Asian Games veteran as a player and shared this distinction with Alvin Patrimonio, as the only PBA players to play in four Asiads (1986, 1990, 1994, 1998). In 1986, he led an all-amateur national team to an Asian Games bronze medal, after a heart breaking controversial loss to South Korea in the semi-final. He is also the only Filipino player to win the William Jones Cup championships twice, once as an amateur in 1985 and once as a professional in 1998.

===PBA career===

====Great Taste/Presto Tivoli====

In 1984–1985, Caidic played in the PBA for the all-amateur guest NCC national team, preparing for international competitions, and went on to win the 1985 PBA Reinforced Conference. In 1986, he returned to the PBA playing for the all-amateur Magnolia-Philippines who were at that time preparing for the 1986 Asian Games.

In 1987, he was drafted first overall by the Great Taste Coffee Makers and played alongside Ricardo Brown to lead the team to the PBA Open Conference finals (In Game 3, he equalled Brown&#x27;s PBA all-time record for the most points scored by a Filipino in a single finals game – 48 points) and later captured his first PBA-All Filipino Cup championship. In his rookie season, he earned the 1987 PBA Rookie of the Year award and was named in the All-Star Mythical Five Selection, where he became the third first year-rookie player ever to be named in the Mythical Five Selection after Arnie Tuadles (1979) and Ricardo Brown (1983). He also finished the season as the first rookie player ever to lead the league in scoring.

On November 2, 1989, Caidic scored 68 points and 15 three-point field goals made in a single game to lead Presto Tivoli past the Alaska Air Force in a high-scoring overtime game 175–159. Both teams&#x27; combined points was one of the most in the PBA history.

In 1990, he set the PBA all-time record for the most three-point field goals made in a single season (160 triples) and led Presto Tivoli to a championship title. He was named the 1990 PBA Most Valuable Player and was selected to play for the first all-pro national team coached by Robert Jaworski, bound for the Asian Games. In one of his Asian Games appearances, he led the national team&#x27;s second half comeback win, 86–78, against Japan with 34 points despite playing with a broken hand and held scoreless in the first half. The Philippines went on to win the silver medal after losing to China in the finals with Caidic and Samboy Lim named in the mythical 5 selection.

On October 15, 1991, he broke the PBA all-time record for the most three-point field goals made in a career with 594 three-point conversions after scoring 9 triples in Tivoli&#x27;s 125–142 loss to Pepsi.

One month later, on November 21, 1991, Caidic sets the PBA all-time records of the most points in a single game by a homegrown Filipino player (79 points), the most points in a single half (53 points), the most points in a single quarter (37 points), the most three-point field goals made and attempts in a game (17/27 triples), the most three-point field goals made in a quarter (8 triples) and the most consecutive three-point field goals made in a single game (8 triples), to lead Presto Tivoli against Ginebra San Miguel. His performance remains as one of the greatest individual performances in the PBA history. What makes it more remarkable is that while he was playing in the court, his wife Millote was giving birth to their first daughter. He came off the bench late in the first quarter and left the game in the middle of the fourth, in a game where he could have possibly scored 100 points or more.

====San Miguel Beermen====

In 1993, Caidic was acquired by the San Miguel Beermen after his former team was sold to Sta. Lucia Realty &amp; Development, Inc. and renamed Sta. Lucia Realtors. During his time with San Miguel, he teamed up with Samboy Lim to form the league&#x27;s deadliest scoring duo in the 1990s and led the Beermen to the 1993 All-Filipino Cup finals. He ended the season winning the PBA Governor&#x27;s Cup championship with San Miguel and earned the 1993 PBA All-Star Most Valuable Player award after leading his team (North All-Star) to victory, scoring 40 points (second highest points scored in a single All-Star game) and 9 triples (the most three-point field goals made in a single All-Star game). He became the first PBA player ever to win the MVP awards in the regular season and in the All-Star Game.

In 1994, San Miguel won the right to represent the country in the Asian Games after winning the PBA All-Filipino Cup conference title. In the Asian Games, the Beermen formed the core of the national team with some loaned players from the other PBA ballclubs like Alvin Patrimonio and Johnny Abarrientos. The national team finished fourth but he finished as the Asian Games basketball tournament leading scorer and was named in the all-tournament Mythical Five Selection.

In 1995, he became the eighth player to score 10,000 career points in the PBA history and the league&#x27;s first player to score 1,000 career three-point field goals. He went on to win the PBA Governor&#x27;s Cup Best Player of the Conference after leading the San Miguel Beermen to the finals. He finished the season as the league&#x27;s leading point scorer with 20.9 points per game, the last guard ever to lead the league in season-best points scoring average in the 20th century.

On April 29, 1997, in a game between the Gordon&#x27;s Gin and the San Miguel Beermen, he suffered a serious career-threatening injury. The incident took place when he jumped for a rebound, he collided with teammate Nelson Asaytono, fell on the floor headfirst, vomited, and remained on the court motionless before he was removed from the arena and taken to the hospital.

He made a successful recovery from that injury and in 1998, he was selected by Tim Cone for the Philippine Centennial Team bound for the William Jones Cup (where he scored 25 points with six triples against South East Asian rival, Thailand) and the Asian Games. The team started their international campaign against China and a PBA All-Star Selection but had a dismal display in the PBA Centennial Cup. They went to a tough United States midwest tour and won the William Jones Cup in Taiwan. In the Asian Games, the nationals easily won their group stage but lost in the semi-final and settled for third after beating Kazakhstan in their final game.

==Post-playing career, retirement and coaching==

In 1999, Caidic became the playing coach of the Barangay Ginebra Kings after a sudden resignation of interim coach Rino Salazar.

In 2000, as a playing coach, he placed himself in the reserved unprotected player list for the Barangay Ginebra Kings to protect other important players in the team. The expansion team Red Bull picked unprotected players from the dispersal draft, which includes himself and got his rights. To avoid leaving Ginebra and playing for Red Bull, he announced his retirement and decided to hang up his jersey that year. His early retirement ended a long distinguished career that started in 1984 as an amateur guest player in the PBA. He also became the third PBA player after Ramon Fernandez and Bogs Adornado to be given the honor of retiring the jersey number by a PBA team and was the first by two PBA teams, the San Miguel Beermen and the Barangay Ginebra Kings. Both franchises retired his number 8 jersey in honor of his legacy in the PBA. In the same year, he was named in the PBA 25 greatest players ever to play in the league&#x27;s history after the PBA celebrated its 25th year as the first professional basketball league in Asia.

After his retirement, he remained with Ginebra as a full-time head coach and despite reaching the 2001 PBA All-Filipino Cup finals, he piloted Ginebra to one of its worst season runs in its franchise history. Due to fans&#x27; uproar, management blinked and promoted him as Team Manager in 2004. He also served as the national team&#x27;s assistant coach in 2002 and was an active participant of the San Miguel Corporation All-Stars, a group composed of several former professional basketball players.

In May 2005, he took part in the PBA&#x27;s 30th Anniversary, leading Virgilio Dalupan&#x27;s Legends Team to victory, 96–92, in the PBA&#x27;s Classic Greatest Game with an MVP performance, scoring 30 points (4 triples, 8 rebounds). He also led the PBA Legends Team to a two-game Australian Tour Series and earned himself the series Most Valuable Player award. He was then appointed Sports Ambassador to represent the Philippines in the 23rd South East Asian Games alongside some of the Philippines&#x27; greatest athletes (Efren Reyes, Rafael Nepomuceno) to promote the event throughout the country. Aside from being one of the country&#x27;s Sports Ambassador, he also served as San Miguel Corporation&#x27;s Philippine Baseball and Boxing Project Director/Liaison Officer for the South East Asian Games. His teams brought 10 gold medals (1 from baseball and 9 from boxing) for the country.

On June 15, 2006, on his 43rd birthday, he fittingly released his autobiographical book, &quot;My Life Allan Caidic, The Triggerman&quot;, one of the first sports biographies by a Filipino athlete. In November 2006, after a reshuffling between the then-four San Miguel Corporation teams, he became the team manager of the Coca-Cola Tigers. But he left in March 2007 to become assistant coach of the Barangay Ginebra Kings.

In January 2007, he joined with former national teammates Hector Calma and Samboy Lim, as well as former national team head coaches, current national team members and head coach Chot Reyes in expressing their support to Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) and for the lifting of suspension of the country from FIBA-sanctioned tournaments.

In 2008, he joined several PBA legends in a charity Tour of California but played a minor role due to personal commitments. Later that year, he led the PBA Legends to victory over the Manny Pacquiao-led Philippine Army Basketball Team to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the army.

In August 2009, he joined another PBA legends&#x27; tour in North America, and weeks later he led a PBA All-Star Selection (scoring five straight triples in the quarter) against Dominique Wilkins&#x27;-led NBA Generations.

On August 27, 2010, he scored 54 points during the 2010 NBA Asia Basketball Challenge held at Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. He also defeated Glen Rice, 7–5 in a three-point shooting contest. Their team won 177–167.

He was formally an assistant coach of the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel under coach Tim Cone in the PBA and the De La Salle Green Archers in the UAAP.

On December 11, 2018, he scored 146 points in an exhibition game in Ilocos Sur and having 46 three-pointers in a game. His team won 184–73.

On October 24, 2023, he was appointed as the commissioner for the Pilipinas Super League.

<text>Thomas Chittenden (January 6, 1730August 25, 1797) was an American politician from Vermont, who was a leader of the territory for nearly two decades. He was the state&#x27;s first and third governor, serving from 1778 to 1789—when it was a largely unrecognized independent state called the Vermont Republic—and again from 1790 until his death. Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791 as its 14th state.

==Early and personal life==
Thomas Chittenden was born in East Guilford in the Connecticut Colony on January 6, 1730. He lost one of his eyes and was referred to as &quot;one eye Tom&quot; by his opponents. He married Elizabeth Meigs on October 4, 1749, in Salisbury, Connecticut. They had four sons and six daughters while they were living in Connecticut, all of whom survived to adulthood. 

==Career==
Chittenden served as a justice of the peace and in the Connecticut Colonial Assembly from 1765 to 1769. He served in Connecticut&#x27;s 14th Regiment of Militia from 1767 to 1773, rising to the rank of colonel.

Chittenden was one of the residents of Salisbury, Connecticut, who purchased land from the Onion River Land Company run by Ethan Allen, Ira Allen, Heman Allen, and Remember Baker. Chittenden moved to the New Hampshire Grants, now Vermont, in 1774, where he was the first settler in the town of Williston. 

Chittenden was a delegate to the 1777 constitutional convention that established Vermont&#x27;s constitution and drafted its Declaration of Independence. Chittenden was selected as governor of the Vermont Republic on March 12, 1778, by the legislature and Joseph Marsh was selected as lieutenant governor.

During the American Revolution, Chittenden was a member of a committee empowered to negotiate with the Continental Congress to allow Vermont to join the Union. The Congress deferred the matter to avoid antagonizing the states of New York and New Hampshire, which had competing claims against Vermont. During the period of the Vermont Republic, Chittenden served as governor from 1778 to 1789 and 1790 to 1791, and was one of the participants in a series of delicate negotiations with British authorities in Quebec over the possibility of establishing Vermont as a British province.

After Vermont entered the federal Union in 1791 as its 14th state, Chittenden continued as governor until his death in 1797.

==Death==
Chittenden died in Williston on August 25, 1797, and is interred at Thomas Chittenden Cemetery, Williston, Chittenden County, Vermont. Citing Vermont&#x27;s tumultuous founding, his epitaph reads: &quot;Out of storm and manifold perils rose an enduring state, the home of freedom and unity.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==
In 1894, a monument to Chittenden was begun at the entrance to the cemetery in Williston which is named for him; it was dedicated in 1896. An engraved portrait of Chittenden can be found just outside the entrance to the Executive Chamber, the ceremonial office of the governor, at the Vermont State House at Montpelier. The portrait is based on a likeness of one of Chittenden&#x27;s grandsons, who was believed to resemble Chittenden. In the late 1990s, a bronze sculpture of Chittenden, which was created by Frank Gaylord, was placed on the grounds of the State House near the building&#x27;s west entrance. Another Chittenden statue, also created by Gaylord, was erected in front of the Williston Central School. Chittenden County is named for him, as is the town of Chittenden in Rutland County.

<doc id="441372" wikidata="Q553533" url="?curid=441372" title="John Bell Hood">
<text>John Bell Hood (June 1 or June 29, 1831 – August 30, 1879) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War. Hood&#x27;s impetuosity led to high losses among his troops as he moved up in rank. Bruce Catton wrote that &quot;the decision to replace Johnston with Hood was probably the single largest mistake that either government made during the war.&quot; Hood&#x27;s education at the United States Military Academy led to a career as a junior officer in the infantry and cavalry of the antebellum U.S. Army in California and Texas. At the start of the Civil War, he offered his services to his adopted state of Texas. He achieved his reputation for aggressive leadership as a brigade commander in the army of Robert E. Lee during the Seven Days Battles in 1862, after which he was promoted to division command. He led a division under James Longstreet in the campaigns of 1862–63. At the Battle of Gettysburg, he was severely wounded, rendering his left arm mostly useless for the rest of his life. Transferred with many of Longstreet&#x27;s troops to the Western Theater, Hood led a massive assault into a gap in the Union line at the Battle of Chickamauga but was wounded again, requiring the amputation of his right leg.

Hood returned to field service during the Atlanta Campaign of 1864 and, at the age of 33, was promoted to temporary full general and command of the Army of Tennessee at the outskirts of Atlanta, making him the youngest soldier on either side of the war to be given command of an army. There, he dissipated his army in a series of unsuccessful assaults and was forced to evacuate the besieged city. Leading his men through Alabama and into Tennessee, his army was severely damaged in a massive frontal assault at the Battle of Franklin. He was decisively defeated at the Battle of Nashville by his former West Point instructor, Major General George Henry Thomas, after which he was relieved of command.

After the war, Hood moved to Louisiana and worked as a cotton broker and in the insurance business. His business was ruined by a yellow fever epidemic in New Orleans during the winter of 1878–79. He succumbed to the disease, dying just days after his wife and oldest child, leaving ten destitute orphans.

==Early life==
John Bell Hood was born in Owingsville, Kentucky, the son of John Wills Hood (1798–1852), a doctor, and Theodosia French Hood (1801–1886). He was a cousin of future Confederate general G. W. Smith and the nephew of U.S. Representative Richard French. French obtained an appointment for Hood at the United States Military Academy, despite his father&#x27;s reluctance to support a military career for his son. Hood graduated in 1853, ranked 44th in a class of 52 that originally numbered 96, after a near-expulsion in his final year for excessive demerits (196 of a permissible 200). At West Point, as well as during his later Army years, he was known to friends as &quot;Sam.&quot; His classmates included James B. McPherson and John M. Schofield, while he received instruction in artillery from George Henry Thomas. These three men all became U.S. Army generals who would later oppose Hood in battle during the Civil War. The superintendent between 1852 and 1855 was Brevet Colonel Robert E. Lee, who would become Hood&#x27;s commanding general in the Eastern Theater. Notwithstanding his modest record at the academy, in 1860, Hood was appointed chief instructor of cavalry at West Point, a position he declined, citing his desire to remain with his active field regiment and to retain all of his options in light of the impending war.

Hood was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Infantry, served at Fort Jones, California, and later transferred to the 2nd U.S. Cavalry in Texas, where he was commanded by Col. Albert Sidney Johnston and Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee. While commanding a reconnaissance patrol from Fort Mason on July 20, 1857, Hood sustained the first of many wounds that marked his life in military service – an arrow through his left hand during action against the Comanches at Devil&#x27;s River, Texas. He was promoted to first lieutenant in August 1858.

==Civil War==

===Brigade and division command===
Hood resigned from the United States Army immediately after the Battle of Fort Sumter and, dissatisfied with the neutrality of his native Kentucky, decided to serve his adopted state of Texas. He joined the Confederate army as a cavalry captain, then was promoted to major and sent to command Brigadier General John B. Magruder&#x27;s cavalry in the lower Virginia Peninsula. Hood and his horsemen won a victory at the Skirmish at Cedar Lane on July 12 near Newport News, capturing 12 men of the 7th New York Regiment of Volunteers as well as two deserters from Fort Monroe. They received high praise from Generals Lee and Magruder. By September 30, the Texan was promoted to be colonel of the 4th Texas Infantry Regiment.

On February 20, 1862, Hood was assigned to command a new brigade of mainly Texas regiments, the Texas Brigade. The brigade was initially formed the previous fall, led by ex-US Senator Louis T. Wigfall, but he resigned his command to take a seat in the Confederate Congress. On March 26, Hood was promoted to brigadier general. Leading the Texas Brigade as part of the Army of Northern Virginia in the Peninsula Campaign, he established his reputation as an aggressive commander, eager to lead his troops personally into battle, and the Texans quickly gained a reputation as one of the army&#x27;s elite combat units. At the Battle of Eltham&#x27;s Landing, Hood&#x27;s men were instrumental in nullifying an amphibious landing by a U.S. division. When commanding general Joseph E. Johnston reflected upon the success Hood&#x27;s men enjoyed in executing his order &quot;to feel the enemy gently and fall back,&quot; he humorously asked, &quot;What would your Texans have done, sir, if I had ordered them to charge and drive back the enemy?&quot; Hood replied, &quot;I suppose, General, they would have driven them into the river, and tried to swim out and capture the gunboats.&quot; The Texas Brigade was held in reserve at Seven Pines.

At the Battle of Gaines&#x27;s Mill on June 27, Hood distinguished himself by leading his brigade in a charge that broke the U.S. line, which was the most successful Confederate performance in the Seven Days Battles. Hood survived unscathed, but over 400 men and most of the officers in the Texas Brigade were killed or wounded. He broke down and wept at the sight of the dead and dying men on the field. After inspecting the U.S. entrenchments, Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson remarked, &quot;The men who carried this position were truly soldiers indeed.&quot;

When Maj. Gen. William H.C. Whiting left the army on medical furlough on July 26, Hood became the permanent division commander, and his command was reassigned to Maj. Gen James Longstreet&#x27;s corps. While the division had numbered five brigades at Seven Pines, several reorganizations reduced it to just two—the Texas Brigade and a brigade of Mississippians commanded by Col. Evander M. Law. Also accompanying them during the Northern Virginia Campaign was the independent South Carolina brigade of Brig. Gen. Nathan &quot;Shanks&quot; Evans, who technically had authority over Hood, his junior in rank, for the campaign. At Second Bull Run, Hood spearheaded the assault on the U.S. left flank that forced them to retreat from the field. Hood&#x27;s two brigades lost over 1,000 men in the battle, and if Evans&#x27;s brigade is also counted in, the total would be nearly 1,500 casualties.

In pursuing U.S. forces, Hood was involved in a dispute with Evans over captured ambulances. Evans arrested Hood, but Gen. Lee intervened and retained him in service. During the Maryland Campaign, just before the Battle of South Mountain, Hood was in the rear, still in virtual arrest. His Texas troops shouted to General Lee, &quot;Give us Hood!&quot; Lee restored Hood to command, despite Hood&#x27;s refusal to apologize for his conduct. 
During the Battle of Antietam, Hood&#x27;s division came to the relief of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s corps on the Confederate left flank, fighting in the infamous cornfield and turning back an assault by the U.S. I Corps in the West Woods. Afterward, they became engaged with the U.S. XII Corps. In the evening after the battle, Gen. Lee asked Hood where his division was. He responded, &quot;They are lying on the field where you sent them. My division has been almost wiped out.&quot; Of his 2,000 men, almost 1,000 were casualties. Jackson was impressed with Hood&#x27;s performance and recommended his promotion to major general, which occurred effective October 10, 1862.

In the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, Hood&#x27;s division saw little action, placed in the center, between Longstreet&#x27;s lines on Marye&#x27;s Heights and Jackson&#x27;s lines. And in the spring of 1863, he missed the Battle of Chancellorsville because most of Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps was on detached duty in Suffolk, Virginia, involving Longstreet himself and Hood&#x27;s and George Pickett&#x27;s divisions. When he heard the news of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s death after Chancellorsville, he expressed grief for the man he most deeply admired, personally and militarily.

===Gettysburg===
It was to Hood that Lee wrote on May 21, 1863, before the Gettysburg Campaign on their growing confidence in the Army of Northern Virginia:

At the Battle of Gettysburg, Longstreet&#x27;s Corps arrived late on the first day, July 1, 1863. Lee planned an assault for the second day, featuring Longstreet&#x27;s Corps attacking northeast up the Emmitsburg Road into the U.S. left flank. Hood was dissatisfied with his assignment in the assault because it would face difficult terrain in the boulder-strewn area known as Devil&#x27;s Den. He requested permission from Longstreet to move around the left flank of the U.S. army, beyond the mountain known as [Big] Round Top, to strike the U.S. soldiers in their rear area. Longstreet refused permission, citing Lee&#x27;s orders, despite repeated protests from Hood. Yielding to the inevitable, Hood finally gave in, and his division stepped off around 4 p.m. on July 2. Still, various factors caused it to veer to the east, away from its intended direction, where it would eventually meet with U.S. forces at Little Round Top. As the attack started, Hood was the victim of an artillery shell exploding overhead, severely damaging his left arm, which incapacitated him (although the arm was not amputated). His ranking brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law, assumed command of the division. Still, confusion about orders and command status dissipated the direction and strength of the Confederate attack, significantly affecting the battle&#x27;s outcome.

Hood recuperated in Richmond, Virginia, where he made a social impression on the ladies of the Confederacy. In August 1863, famous diarist Mary Boykin Chesnut wrote of Hood:

As he recuperated, Hood began a campaign to win the heart of the young, prominent South Carolina socialite Sally Buchanan Preston, known as &quot;Buck&quot; to her friends, whom he had first met while traveling through Richmond in March 1863. Hood later confessed that the flirtatious southern belle had caused him to &quot;surrender at first sight.&quot; As he prepared to return to duty in September, Hood proposed marriage to Buck but received only a noncommittal response.

===Chickamauga===
Meanwhile, in the Western Theater, the Confederate army under General Braxton Bragg was faring poorly. Lee dispatched two divisions of Longstreet&#x27;s Corps to Tennessee, and Hood was able to rejoin his men at Chickamauga Creek on September 18. Bragg ordered him to form a &quot;mini-corps,&quot; merging one of the brigades he had on the field with Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division. It was then that Hood participated in the Battle of Chickamauga, driving Col. Robert Minty&#x27;s U.S. brigade from Reed&#x27;s Bridge and stopping only at Alexander&#x27;s Bridge, where John T. Wilder&#x27;s men fired their Spencer repeating rifles on the Confederates. As darkness set in, he chanced upon Gen. John C. Breckinridge, former vice president of the United States, presidential candidate and senator from Kentucky, who also happened to be a cousin of Buck Preston. The remaining two units of Hood&#x27;s division regrouped with their commander to prepare for the next day&#x27;s battle.

On the afternoon of the 19th, Hood repulsed an attack by Jefferson C. Davis&#x27;s U.S. division. He then advanced to assist Brig. Gen Henry D. Clayton&#x27;s outnumbered men near Lafayette Road. Around this time, Longstreet had arrived; Hood was to be in temporary command of the I Corps, which would serve as part of the Confederate left wing under Longstreet.

On the 20th, Hood led Longstreet&#x27;s assault that exploited a gap in the Federal line, leading to the defeat of Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans&#x27;s U.S. Army of the Cumberland. However, Hood was once again wounded severely; his right femur was fractured, and his leg was amputated four inches (100 mm) below the hip. Hood&#x27;s condition was so grave that the surgeon sent the severed leg with him in the ambulance, assuming they would be buried together. Hood was taken to the home of Col. Francis Little to recover for several weeks before going to Richmond to continue his recovery. Because of Hood&#x27;s bravery at Chickamauga, Longstreet recommended that he be promoted to lieutenant general as of that date, September 20, 1863; the confirmation by the Confederate Senate occurred on February 11, 1864, as Hood was preparing to return to duty.

During Hood&#x27;s second recuperation in Richmond that fall, he befriended Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who would subsequently promote him to a more important role. He also resumed his courtship of Buck Preston—a cousin of Breckinridge&#x27;s—who dashed his hopes on Christmas Eve despite giving him some ambiguously positive signals. Hood confided to Mary Chesnut that the courtship &quot;was the hardest battle he had ever fought in his life.&quot; In February, Hood again proposed to Buck, demanding a specific response and receiving a reluctant, embarrassed agreement. However, the Preston family disapproved of Hood, who left for the field unmarried.

===Atlanta Campaign and the Army of Tennessee===

In the spring of 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee, under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, was engaged in a campaign of maneuver against William T. Sherman, who was driving from Chattanooga toward Atlanta. Despite his two damaged limbs, Hood performed well in the field, riding as much as 20 miles a day without apparent difficulty, strapped to his horse with his artificial leg hanging stiffly, and an orderly following closely behind with crutches. The leg, made of cork, was donated (along with a couple of spares) by members of his Texas Brigade, who had collected $3,100 in a single day for that purpose; it had been imported from Europe through the U.S. blockade. On May 12, Hood was baptized by Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk, the former Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana. Col. Walter H. Rodgers, a witness to the baptism, stated that Hood &quot;looked happy and as though a great burden had been lifted.&quot;

During the Atlanta Campaign, Hood urged the normally cautious Johnston to act aggressively. Still, Johnston usually reacted to flanking maneuvers by Sherman with timely withdrawals, similar to his strategy in the Peninsula Campaign. One attempt by Johnston to act decisively in the offensive, during the Battle of Cassville, ironically was foiled by Hood, who had been ordered to attack the flank of one column of Sherman&#x27;s army, but instead pulled back and entrenched when confronted by the unexpected arrival of a small detachment of that column.

The Army of Tennessee continued withdrawing until it had crossed the last major water barrier before Atlanta, the Chattahoochee River. During this time, Hood had been sending the government in Richmond letters very critical of Johnston&#x27;s conduct, bypassing official communication channels. The issue came to a head when President Jefferson Davis ordered Gen. Braxton Bragg to travel to Atlanta to personally interview Johnston. After meeting with Johnston, he interviewed Hood and another subordinate, Joseph Wheeler, who told him they had repeatedly urged Johnston to attack. Hood presented a letter that branded Johnston as being both ineffective and weak-willed. He told Bragg, &quot;I have, General, so often urged that we should force the enemy to give us battle as to almost be regarded reckless by the officers high in rank in this army [meaning Johnston and senior corps commander William J. Hardee], since their views have been so directly opposite.&quot; Johnston&#x27;s biographer, Craig L. Symonds, judges that Hood&#x27;s letter &quot;stepped over the line from unprofessional to outright subversive.&quot; Civil War historian Steven E. Woodworth wrote that Hood was &quot;letting his ambition get the better of his honesty&quot; because &quot;the truth was that Hood, more often than Hardee, had counseled Johnston to retreat.&quot; However, Hood was not alone in his criticism of Johnston&#x27;s timidity. In William Hardee&#x27;s June 22, 1864, letter to General Bragg, he stated, &quot;If the present system continues we may find ourselves at Atlanta before a serious battle is fought.&quot; Other generals in the Army agreed with that assessment.

On July 17, 1864, Davis relieved Johnston. He considered replacing him with the more senior Hardee, but Bragg strongly recommended Hood. Bragg had not only been impressed by his interview with Hood but also retained lingering resentments against Hardee from bitter disagreements in previous campaigns. Hood was promoted to the temporary rank of full general on July 18 and given command of the army just outside the gates of Atlanta. (Hood&#x27;s temporary appointment as a full general was never confirmed by the Confederate Senate. His commission as a lieutenant general resumed on January 23, 1865.) At 33, Hood was the youngest man on either side to be given command of an army. Robert E. Lee gave an ambiguous reply to Davis&#x27;s request for his opinion about the promotion, calling Hood &quot;a bold fighter, very industrious on the battlefield, careless off&quot;. Lee also stated in the same letter to Davis that he had a high opinion of Hood&#x27;s &quot;gallantry, earnestness, and zeal&quot;; however, he remained &quot;doubtful&quot; as to whether Hood possessed all of the qualities necessary to command an army in the field.

The change of command in the Army of Tennessee did not go unnoticed by Sherman. His subordinates, Maj. Gen. James McPherson and Maj. Gen. John Schofield, shared their knowledge of Hood from their time together at West Point. Upon learning of his new adversary&#x27;s perceived reckless and gambling tendencies, Sherman planned to use that to his advantage.

Hood conducted the remainder of the Atlanta Campaign with the strong, aggressive actions for which he had become famous. He launched four major attacks that summer in an attempt to break Sherman&#x27;s siege of Atlanta, starting almost immediately with an attack along Peachtree Creek. After hearing that McPherson was mortally wounded in the Battle of Atlanta, Hood deeply regretted his loss. All of the offensives failed, particularly at the Battle of Ezra Church, with significant Confederate casualties. Finally, on the evening of September 1, 1864, Hood evacuated the city of Atlanta, burning as many military supplies and installations as possible.

===Franklin–Nashville Campaign===

As Sherman regrouped in Atlanta, preparing for his March to the Sea, Hood and Jefferson Davis met to devise a strategy to defeat him. They planned to attack Sherman&#x27;s lines of communications between Chattanooga and Atlanta and to move north through Alabama and into central Tennessee, assuming that Sherman would be threatened and follow. Hood&#x27;s ambitious hope was that he could maneuver Sherman into a decisive battle, defeat him, recruit additional forces in Tennessee and Kentucky, and pass through the Cumberland Gap to come to the aid of Robert E. Lee, who was besieged at Petersburg. However, the plan failed since Sherman felt this development furthered his current objective by removing opposing forces in his path, noting: &quot;If he [Hood] will go to the Ohio River, I&#x27;ll give him rations. ...my business is down south.&quot; Instead of pursuing Hood with his army, he sent Maj Gen. George Henry Thomas to take control of the U.S. forces in Tennessee and coordinate the defense against Hood, while the bulk of Sherman&#x27;s forces prepared to march toward Savannah.

During their conference, Davis expressed his disappointment in Hood&#x27;s performance in defending Atlanta, losing almost 20,000 men in ill-advised frontal assaults for no significant gains, and implied that he was considering replacing Hood in command of the army. After the president&#x27;s departure for Montgomery, Alabama, he telegraphed Hood that he had decided to retain him in command and, acceding to Hood&#x27;s request, transferred Hardee out of the Army of Tennessee. He also established a new theater commander to supervise Hood and the department of Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor, although the officer selected for the assignment, Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, was not expected to exert any real operational control of the armies in the field.

Hood&#x27;s Tennessee Campaign lasted from September to December 1864, comprising seven battles and hundreds of miles of marching. He attempted to trap a large part of the U.S. Army of the Ohio under Major General Schofield at Spring Hill, Tennessee, before it could link up with Thomas in Nashville, but command failures and misunderstandings allowed Schofield&#x27;s men to pass by Hood&#x27;s army in the night safely. The next day at the Battle of Franklin, Hood sent his men across nearly two miles of open ground without the support of artillery in a last-gasp effort to destroy Schofield&#x27;s forces before they could withdraw across the Harpeth River and reach the safety of Nashville, which was only a night&#x27;s march from Franklin. His troops were unsuccessful in their attempt to breach the U.S. breastworks, suffering severe casualties in an assault that is sometimes called the &quot;Pickett&#x27;s Charge of the West.&quot; Hood&#x27;s exhausted army failed to interfere as the U.S. forces withdrew into Nashville. He later wrote, &quot;[n]ever did troops fight more gallantly&quot; than at Franklin. Some popular histories assert that Hood acted rashly in a fit of rage, resentful that the U.S. Army had slipped past his troops the night before at Spring Hill, and that he wanted to discipline his army by ordering his men to assault against strong odds. Recent scholarship by Eric Jacobson and Stephen M. Hood discounts this as unlikely, as it was not only militarily foolish but Hood was observed to be determined, not angry, by the time he arrived in Franklin.

Unwilling to abandon his original plan, Hood stumbled toward the heavily fortified capital of Tennessee and laid siege with inferior forces, which endured the beginning of a severe winter. U.S. Maj. Gen. Thomas attacked and completely routed Hood two weeks later at the Battle of Nashville. During the battle and the subsequent relentless pursuit to the south, the Army of Tennessee ceased to be an effective fighting force, as the campaign cost the army about 23,500 of its initial strength of 38,000. Hood and the remnants of the army retreated as far as Tupelo, Mississippi. Some survivors eventually joined Joseph E. Johnston for the Carolinas Campaign against Sherman. P. G. T. Beauregard sought permission to replace Hood with Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor, and the change of command occurred on January 23, 1865. In a speech to his men, Hood hoped they would support Taylor and avenge their comrades &quot;whose bones lay bleaching upon the fields of Middle Tennessee.&quot; He returned to Richmond on February 8.

===Final days of the war===
In March 1865, Hood requested an assignment to the Trans-Mississippi Theater to report on the situation and assess the possibility of moving troops across the Mississippi River to reinforce the East. He met with Lt. Gen. Taylor in Mississippi in late April and agreed with Taylor&#x27;s proposal that his force should surrender. He departed to take this recommendation to the commanders remaining in the field. Still, before he arrived in Texas, General Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered his forces, and Hood surrendered himself in Natchez, Mississippi, where he was paroled on May 31, 1865.

=== Race and slavery ===
In a letter Hood wrote to Sherman on September 12, 1864, Hood described his conviction that &quot;negroes&quot; were an inferior race: &quot;You came into our country with your Army, avowedly for the purpose of subjugating free white men, women, and children, and not only intend to rule over them, but you make negroes your allies, and desire to place over us an inferior race, which we have raised from barbarism to its present position, which is the highest ever attained by that race, in any country in all time.&quot;

In the same letter, Hood responded to Sherman&#x27;s accusation that he did not care for the well-being of the women and children of Atlanta, writing: &quot;I believe, for all the true men, aye, and women and children, in my country, we will fight you to the death. Better die a thousand deaths than submit to live under you or your Government and your Negro allies.&quot; Within a year, Hood had surrendered.

==Postbellum career==

After the war, Hood moved to Louisiana and became a cotton broker and worked as president of the Life Association of America, an insurance business. In 1868, he married New Orleans native Anna Marie Hennen, with whom he had 11 children over ten years, including three pairs of twins. He also served the community in numerous philanthropic endeavors, assisting in fund-raising for orphans, widows, and wounded soldiers.

During the postwar period, he began a memoir, &quot;Advance and Retreat: Personal Experiences in the United States and Confederate States Armies&quot;. Though rough, incomplete, and unpublished until after his death, this work served to justify his actions, particularly in response to what he considered misleading or false accusations made by Joseph E. Johnston and to negative portrayals in William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s memoirs.

His insurance business collapsed during the Lower Mississippi Valley yellow fever epidemic of 1878. Soon after, in a single week, the epidemic killed Hood himself (he died on August 30), Hood&#x27;s wife, and his eldest daughter Lydia. His other ten children were left orphaned and destitute. The Texas Brigade Association supported the children for more than 20 years. Seven families in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, and New York eventually adopted all ten.

==Legacy==
John Bell Hood is interred in the Hennen family tomb at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. He is memorialized by Hood County in Texas, and formerly, the U.S. Army installation, Fort Cavazos which was named Fort Hood, in central Texas.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, passed by Congress overriding a previous veto by President Trump, includes a provision that all 10 Army bases named after prominent Confederate military leaders, including Fort Hood, be renamed.

There was a John B. Hood Junior High School at 7625 Hume Dr. in Dallas, Texas, but it was renamed in 2016.

There was a John B. Hood Junior High School at 601 E. 38th St. in Odessa, Texas, but it was renamed in 2015.

Hood Street in Hollywood, Florida, was renamed in 2018.

Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s poem &quot;Army of Northern Virginia&quot; included a passage about Hood:

: Yellow-haired Hood with his wounds and his empty sleeve,
: Leading his Texans, a Viking shape of a man,
: With the thrust and lack of craft of a berserk sword,
: All lion, none of the fox.
:              When he supersedes
: Joe Johnston, he is lost, and his army with him,
: But he could lead forlorn hopes with the ghost of Ney.
: His bigboned Texans follow him into the mist.
: Who follows them?

Private Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry &quot;Maury Greys&quot; wrote the following epitaph to Hood, published in various editions of his memoirs &quot;Company Aytch&quot;:
: But the half of brave Hood&#x27;s body molders here.
: The rest was lost in honor&#x27;s bold career.
: Though fame and limbs he scattered all around;
: Yet still though mangled was with glory crowned.
: For ever ready with his blood to part,
: War left him nothing whole, except his heart.

Watkins was also sympathetic with the Texas general and recounted the private Tennessean soldiers&#x27; honor of having to serve under him in several passages. While previously critical of Hood after Nashville, he later changed his opinion. In one of the &quot;Other Sketches&quot; of his aforementioned memoir, he offers the following appraisal of Hood:

In Bell I. Wiley&#x27;s 1943 book, &quot;The Life of Johnny Reb, the Common Soldier of the Confederacy&quot;, he recounts that after the defeats in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, Hood&#x27;s troops sang with wry humor a verse about him as part of the song &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot;.

: My feet are torn and bloody,
: My heart is full of woe,
: I&#x27;m going back to Georgia
: To find my uncle Joe [Johnston].
: You may talk about your Beauregard,
: You may sing of Bobby Lee,
: But the gallant Hood of Texas
: He played hell in Tennessee.

In the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (the adaptation of Michael Shaara&#x27;s novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;), and &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, adapted from the book by Jeff Shaara, Hood was portrayed by Patrick Gorman. At the time Gorman played Hood in Gods and Generals he would have been almost 40 years older than the age Hood would have been during the events portrayed. Gorman appeared as an older man with graying hair while the real Hood was known for having blonde hair and a youthful appearance.

<text>Viva La Bam is an American reality television series that stars Bam Margera and his friends and family. The show is a spin-off from MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot;, in which Margera and most of the main cast appeared. Each episode had a specific theme, mission, or challenge which was accomplished by performing pranks, skateboarding, and enlisting the help of friends, relatives, and/or experts. Although partly improvised, the show was supported by a greater degree of planning and organization.

== History ==

=== Production ===
The cast included Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Brandon DiCamillo, Raab Himself, and Rake Yohn. The show also starred Bam&#x27;s parents Phil and April and his uncle Don Vito. Tim Glomb and Brandon Novak later joined the main cast. The show was mostly filmed in and around West Chester, Pennsylvania and also visited Las Vegas, Atlantic City, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Mexico, Brazil, and Finland. The episode &quot;Iceland&quot;, originally shot for the second season, became known as the &quot;Lost Episode&quot; of the series, and can be found on &quot;Viva La Bands&quot;: a two-disc compilation album featuring several bands from the series.

The show debuted on October 26, 2003, and concluded on August 14, 2005, on the MTV network in the United States. It later became licensed around the world. Tony Hawk starred in the pilot and Mardi Gras episodes. Each of the five seasons consisted of eight half-hour episodes, comprising 40 episodes in total. In December 2005, Bam Margera addressed rumors of a sixth season on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. His comment was that there would be no sixth season, but there would be occasional MTV specials and he and Johnny Knoxville were planning things for possible &quot;Jackass&quot; stunts. On March 22, 2006, a 2 episode special of &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;, titled &quot;Viva La Spring Break&quot; aired. It featured Bam and his friends, his parents April and Phil, and his uncle Don Vito travelling from West Chester, Pennsylvania to Fort Lauderdale, Florida together to cause mayhem at a beach party, with them doing stunts and pulling pranks underway. Notably, Raab Himself did not appear in this special.

=== Featured music and guests ===
The show also featured music from some of Margera&#x27;s favorite bands, such as HIM, CKY, Bloodhound Gang, Cradle of Filth, Clutch, Turbonegro, Dimmu Borgir, Carnal Forge, Slayer, Gwar, Children of Bodom, The Bled, The 69 Eyes, and Free Beer. Many of Margera&#x27;s friends also appear on the show, including Johnny Knoxville, The Dudesons, and fellow skateboarders Tony Hawk, Terry Kennedy, Jason Ellis, and Bob Burnquist. Actor Sean Penn and his son Hopper made an appearance in the episode &quot;Fort Knoxville&quot;, and rock musician Billy Idol appeared on the &quot;special&quot; birthday episode &quot;Ape&#x27;s Surprise&quot;. In the episode &quot;Driveway Skatepark&quot; there are a number of celebrities such as Tommy Lee, Dave Grohl, Holly Madison, Pharrell Williams, Don &quot;Magic&quot; Juan and Charlie O&#x27;Connell.

<text>Wildboyz is an American television series which debuted in 2003 on MTV and moved to MTV2 in its third season. It is a spin-off and follow-up to &quot;Jackass&quot;. The show stars Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Jason &quot;Wee Man&quot; Acuña, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey and Dave England, who perform stunts and acts with animals, often putting themselves in situations for which they are not trained.

==Format==

&quot;Wildboyz&quot; follows the antics of mainly Chris Pontius and Steve-O along with Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey and Dave England as they travel around the globe. Over the course of 4 seasons, Pontius and Steve-O traveled to 19 different locations. At each location, the pair would interact with the wild and learn the culture of the natives. Some of their antics include dressing up and running with the animals they encounter, subjecting themselves to the defense mechanisms of the animals, and eating the food of the local people.

The dangerous nature of the stunts go beyond that of either &quot;Jackass&quot; or another similar spin-off, &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. In the course of the show, Steve-O purposely subjected himself to the relatively mild sting of the emperor scorpion on more than one occasion, and Pontius was nearly attacked by a jaguar and was bitten by a black bear. One of their most dangerous stunts showed the boys attracting a great white shark while disguised as seals, then jumping into the open water just 10m away. Another stunt included dangling meat attached to a hammock to attract lions. In yet another dangerous stunt, the pair dressed up as fake zebras to try to lure lions. The supposed sport of &quot;hyena football&quot; also made its debut, which in its earliest form was nothing more than a game of keep-away with a pack of spotted hyenas, using smoked ham as a ball. The &quot;sport&quot;, according to its founders, &quot;deserves Olympic status&quot;.

Some of the scenes were intentionally mislabeled for dramatization, as many of the animals used were from a company called Hollywood Animals.

Several members of the &quot;Jackass&quot; cast and crew contributed assistance to the show. The director of &quot;Jackass&quot;, Jeff Tremaine, served as director and executive producer of &quot;Wildboyz&quot;. Cameramen Dimitry Elyashkevich and Rick Kosick also continued to work alongside Tremaine on &quot;Wildboyz&quot;. Manny Puig, a wild animal expert who appeared on &quot;Jackass&quot; several times, occasionally joined the &quot;Wildboyz&quot; on their adventures. Fellow &quot;Jackass&quot; cast members Johnny Knoxville, Wee Man and Loomis Fall also made guest appearances on the show throughout all four seasons.

===End===
The show ended in 2006, after four seasons. Steve-O later wrote in his memoir that &quot;&quot;Wildboyz&quot; probably could&#x27;ve kept going after Season 4. It just didn&#x27;t seem like there was a point. Over time, it had essentially evolved back into &quot;Jackass&quot;. During our final trip to Russia there were no stunts that wouldn&#x27;t have fit in just as easily on &quot;Jackass&quot;. Johnny Knoxville came along on that trip too, which contributed even more to that vibe.&quot; Though no proper series finale was created, the concept of &quot;Wildboyz&quot; was somewhat revisited during &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, which was filmed after &quot;Wildboyz&quot; had ended. Director Jeff Tremaine says, &quot;We shot some of the most amazing stuff [for &quot;Wildboyz&quot;] we&#x27;ve ever made. And so one of the ideas with &quot;Number Two&quot; was to recreate some of the best things we ever shot for &quot;Wildboyz&quot;. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t always work out.&quot;
*&quot;The Fish Hook&quot; sketch in &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; featured &quot;Wildboyz&quot; stars Pontius, Steve-O and frequent collaborator Manny Puig, fishing for sharks in the Gulf of Mexico. The sketch involved Pontius fishing with Steve-O as his bait, and in order to attach himself to Pontius&#x27; fishing line, Steve-O put a fish hook through his cheek. The sketch ended after Steve-O kicked a mako shark in the head. During the commentary for &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, cameraman Dimitry Elyashkevich jokingly called the sketch &quot;Wildboyz: The Movie!&quot;.
*The &quot;How to Milk a Horse&quot; sketch was in fact filmed for &quot;Wildboyz&quot;, according to Jeff Tremaine in the director&#x27;s commentary for the DVD release, but due to its explicit content (Steve-O, Pontius, and Knoxville obtained a sperm sample from a studded horse, which Pontius proceeded to drink), Tremaine said that it would never have aired on MTV.

Additional footage captured during the filming of &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; also followed a &quot;Wildboyz&quot;-style format. These sketches can be seen in &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot;: 
*A balloon is placed between Steve-O&#x27;s butt and is popped by the bite of an eastern diamondback rattlesnake.
*Chris Pontius is bitten on the nose by a snapping turtle in a scene identical to one filmed for &quot;Wildboyz&quot;.
*Wee Man runs through the streets of India with dozens of other short men all dressed in blue with orange wigs, chasing Preston Lacy, and vice versa. 
*Steve-O drinks beer off the fingernails of Shridhar Chillal, an Indian man alleged to have the longest fingernails in the world. Steve-O throws up repeatedly, upsetting the many Indian actresses on set.
*One sketch was designed to display all Indian stereotypes in one scene. After much searching for a talent to perform this skit, Ehren McGhehey agrees reluctantly. He lies on a bed of nails wearing a turban with a cobra in a basket on his chest. He is surrounded by Indian snake charmers, a painted elephant, and &quot;Wildboyz&quot; stars Pontius and Steve-O.
*In a sketch dubbed by director Jeff Tremaine to be &quot;the ultimate failed bit,&quot; &quot;Jackass&quot; stars Chris Pontius, Steve-O, and Dave England visit the Aghori tribe of India. The tribe disturbs the actors and the sketch fails.
*A sketch where Johnny Knoxville gets a prostate exam in Russia was originally shot for &quot;Wildboyz&quot;, but it was never shown on TV and instead was put in &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot;.
Sketches similar to &quot;Wildboyz&quot; in &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; include:
* Dave England and Steve-O playing tetherball with a beehive.
* Chris Pontius&#x27; chin being dressed up as a barbarian while he&#x27;s &quot;battling&quot; scorpions.

Other sketches in &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot; similar to &quot;Wildboyz&quot; include:
* Steve-O getting bitten on the buttocks by an alligator snapping turtle. Steve-O claimed numerous times throughout &quot;Wildboyz&quot; his dislike for alligator snapping turtles. Once the turtle bit, it refused to let go as Steve-O screamed and writhed in pain.
* During the filming of &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, Jeff Tremaine discussed a scene he shot for &quot;Wildboyz&quot;, in which Steve-O and Chris Pontius wore a two-person llama costume, and an actual llama with an erection attempted to mate with the costume. Tremaine claimed that seeing Steve-O, the bottom half, being &quot;raped&quot; by the llama was &quot;the funniest thing he had ever filmed.&quot; The &quot;Jackass&quot; crew made an unsuccessful attempt to replicate this with a donkey and a costume of one with clearly defined orifices. Steve-O and Johnny Knoxville wore the costume. Even after coating the orifices with female donkey urine, the donkey failed to become aroused. The same donkey suit makes a cameo appearance during the end credits of the 2012 Girl &amp; Chocolate skateboard movie &quot;Pretty Sweet&quot;.
Sketches in &quot;Jackass Forever&quot; similar to &quot;Wildboyz&quot; include:
* At the end of the opening sequence of &quot;Jackass Forever&quot;, Chris Pontius gets bit on his penis by a snapping turtle. 
* Steve-O putting a queen bee around his penis. A lot of other bees then latch onto and sting his penis.
* New cast member Sean &quot;Poopies&quot; McInerney attempting to kiss a Texas rat snake.
* Ehren McGhehey getting his nipple bit by a tarantula.
* New cast member Rachel Wolfson getting a botox injection by a scorpion.
* A vulture eating pieces of meat off of Wee Man&#x27;s body as he is tied to the ground, while Chris Pontius and Steve-O are worshiping the vulture. This skit is similar to the &quot;sarcophilus satanicus&quot; skit from &quot;Wildboyz&quot;.
* Chris Pontius drinking pig semen and Dave England unsuspectingly getting it poured over him.
Sketches in &quot;Jackass 4.5&quot; similar to &quot;Wildboyz&quot; include:
* Ehren McGhehey and Wee Man standing in a see-through tub with an electric eel. Wee Man then puts a key in Ehren&#x27;s ass and touches the electric eel.
* Wee Man unsuspectingly getting horse semen poured over him.
* Steve-O putting fish in his ass and having a raptor attack and eat it.
* Steve-O getting his eyebrows waxed off by tying the thread to an eagle that flies away.
* New cast member Poopies unsuspectingly getting pig semen poured over him.

<doc id="441385" wikidata="Q334874" url="?curid=441385" title="Sighetu Marmației">
<text>Sighetu Marmației (, also spelled &quot;Sighetul Marmației&quot;; or &quot;Siget&quot;; , ; ; ), until 1960 Sighet, is a city in Maramureș County near the Iza River, in northwestern Romania.

==Geography==
Sighetu Marmației is situated along the Tisa river on the border with Ukraine, across from the Ukrainian town of Solotvyno.
Neighboring communities include: Sarasău, Săpânța, Câmpulung la Tisa, Ocna Șugatag, Giulești, Vadu Izei, Rona de Jos and Bocicoiu Mare communities in Romania, Bila Cerkva community and the Solotvyno township in Ukraine (Zakarpattia Oblast). The city administers five villages: Iapa (&quot;Kabolapatak&quot;), Lazu Baciului (&quot;Bácsiláz&quot;), Șugău (&quot;Sugó&quot;), Valea Cufundoasă (&quot;Mélypatak&quot;) and Valea Hotarului (&quot;Határvölgy&quot;).

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Sighetu Marmației had a population of 32,793. At the 2011 census, the city had 37,640 inhabitants; of those, 82.2% were Romanians, 13% Hungarians, 2.3% Ukrainians, and Roma.

According to the 1910 census, the city had 21,370 inhabitants; these consisted of 17,542 (82.1%) Hungarian speakers, 2,002 (9.4%) Romanian, 1,257 (5.9%) German, and 32 Ruthenian speakers. The number of Jews was 7,981; they were included in the Hungarian and German language groups. There were
5,850 Greek Catholics and 4,901 Roman Catholics. According to a 1920 estimate, the city had 23,691 inhabitants, 11,026 being Jews, 6,552 Hungarians, 4,964 Romanians, 149 Germans, and 1,000 of other ethnicities. The 1930 census numbered 27,270 inhabitants, 10,526 of them being Jews, 9,658 Romanians, 5,424 Hungarians, 1,221 Ukrainians, and 441 of other ethnicities.

== Etymology ==
The municipality&#x27;s name derives from Hungarian name which means &quot;island in Máramaros&quot;. According to the legend, the place name comes from the Hungarian expression &quot;mára már rossz&quot; (too bad by now), referring to that the local tribes moved to Moldavia.

Inhabitants simply call to the city Sighet and similar abbreviations in their mother tongue.

==History==
Inhabited since the Hallstatt period, the populated area lies in the Tisza Valley, an important route as being the only access to the otherwise mountainous, sparsely populated region. After 895 in the 10th century the area became part of Kingdom of Hungary. The first mention of a settlement dates back to the 11th century, and the city as such was first mentioned in 1326. In 1352, it was a free royal town and the capital of Máramaros &quot;comitatus&quot;, just outside Transylvania.

After the defeat at the Battle of Mohács and the death of Louis II of Hungary, in the ensuing struggle for the Hungarian throne, the kingdom was divided into Royal Hungary of Habsburg Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom of John Zápolya the Voivode of Transylvania. In 1570 the Principality of Transylvania was formed which included Máramaros County. Transylvania, including Maramureș, became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire from 1541. In 1711, King Charles III returned Máramaros County to his Hungarian domain.

During World War I, the city was briefly occupied by Russian forces between 3 - 7 October 1914. 1918 saw the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. On November 22, 1918, in an assembly of Romanians from Maramureș took place in the town&#x27;s central square, electing a national council and deciding to send a delegation to the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia, which voted the union of Transylvania with Romania. The Romanian Army took control of the area in the spring of 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The Allied Powers accepted the Romanian demands and Transylvania including Máramaros County was formally ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in the Treaty of Trianon in June 1920.

In 1919, six Romanian schools opened in Sighet: a boys&#x27; high school, a girls&#x27; high school, a boys&#x27; elementary school, a co-ed commercial gymnasium, and two commercial high schools (one for boys, the other for girls). The Maramureș ethnographic museum opened in the cultural palace in 1926. During the interwar period, over twenty newspapers appeared in the town, as well as a number of literary reviews. In August 1940, the Second Vienna Award, arbitrated by Germany and Italy, reassigned the territory of Northern Transylvania from Romania to Hungary. As a result, Sighetu Marmației came under Hungarian administration during World War II.

A first deportation of Jews from Sighet took place in 1941. The second occurred after Passover 1944, so that by April, the town&#x27;s ghetto contained close to 13,000 Jews from Sighet itself and the neighboring places of Dragomirești, Ocna Șugatag, and Vișeu de Sus. Between May 16 and 22, the ghetto was liquidated in four transports, its inhabitants sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. Among the deportees was Sighet native and future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel. In 1947, there were some 2,300 Jews in Sighet, including survivors and a considerable number of Jews from other parts of Romania. By 2002, the town had 20 remaining Jews.

Towards the end of World War II, the city was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944. The Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 voided the Vienna Awards, and reaffirmed the Trianon borders.

In 1948, the new Communist regime nationalized the city&#x27;s factories, three publishing houses and banks. In 1950, with the counties replaced by regions, Sighet lost its status as an administrative center and became part of the . In 1960, the building of neighborhoods with apartment blocks began. The same year, the town&#x27;s name became &quot;Sighetul Marmației&quot;; the final “l” was dropped in 1968, when the city became once again part of Maramureș County. 1962 saw the opening of a wood processing factory (&quot;Combinatul de Industrializare a Lemnului&quot;). Turning out furniture and other wood products, the enterprise had over 6,000 employees and played an important part in the city&#x27;s economic development. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, it gradually fell upon hard times, with nine private firms employing some 3,500 in 2012. A second important employer during the Communist period was a textile factory.

In May 2014, a commemoration was held in honour of the 70th anniversary of the deportations in May 1944. Events included a Klezmer concert, Sabbath services in the one remaining synagogue, a memorial service at the Holocaust Monument at the site of the deportations, as well as an exhibit on life in Sighet prior to the deportations. The exhibit contained contributions by survivors and their families. Additionally, visits were organized to the Jewish Cemetery as well as the Holocaust Museum located in the childhood home of Elie Wiesel. On 3 August 2018, Wiesel&#x27;s birthplace was vandalized.

== Sighet Prison ==

After the establishment of the Romanian communist regime, the Securitate ran the Sighet Prison during the 1950s and 1960s as a place for the detention and political repression of public figures who had been declared &quot;class enemies.&quot; The most prominent of these was the former prime minister Iuliu Maniu, who died in the prison in 1953. The former prison is operated as a museum, part of the Memorial of the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance.

<text>Stephen John &quot;Steve&quot; Linford (born 12 December 1956) is a British entrepreneur and anti-spam campaigner best known for founding The Spamhaus Project.

Linford was born in London, England, in 1956. His family moved to Rome, Italy, where Steve attended St. George&#x27;s British International School. After leaving college to pursue a music career, Linford made his living writing music and playing with Italian, German and English rock groups. For a number of years he was under contract to Italy&#x27;s &#x27;GM&#x27; record label and worked on film music with composer Ennio Morricone In the early 1980s he became involved in concert production. When artists including Pink Floyd and Michael Jackson toured Italy, Linford served as their Production Manager.

As computers began to be used in the music industry, Linford developed an interest in computer technology. In 1986 he moved to England, where he set up a software company whose flagship product was a file-searching program called UltraFind for the Apple Macintosh similar to, but predating by many years, Apple&#x27;s Sherlock. With the arrival of the Internet Linford refocused the company in 1996 as an internet technologies company called Ultradesign Internet, around which he built a server hosting network called UXN.

Finding that his customers were being harassed with junk emails, he sought ways to stop the problem and in doing so became an anti-spam campaigner. In 1998 he founded Spamhaus.

With the support of the internet&#x27;s major networks, Spamhaus started a real-time spam-blacklisting database which was then used by internet service providers, governments and military networks to block billions of junk and virus emails from reaching internet users and this activity made Linford a target for cyber-criminals whose operations were crippled by Spamhaus. He received death threats from criminal spam gangs around the world, many of which were posted online.

Today his project&#x27;s technologies are used by an estimated three-quarters of the world&#x27;s internet networks and serve over 3.1 billion email users.

In 2005 Linford left England and currently resides in the Principality of Andorra. He is CEO of the Spamhaus organisation, a group of several companies based in the UK and Andorra working in communications filter technology and cybersecurity.

== Awards ==
In 2003 &quot;The New York Times&quot; dedicated the front page of its Business section to an article about Steve Linford. Since then he has spoken on spam and cybersecurity at government hearings, the European Parliament and the UN. In 2003 he was named as one of the technical industry&#x27;s &#x27;Top 50 Agenda Setters&#x27; by Silicon Magazine. In 2004 he was given the Internet Hero Award by the British ISP Association ISPA. In 2005 he was nominated for Outstanding Contribution to the UK Technology Industry.

<doc id="441390" wikidata="Q667944" url="?curid=441390" title="Temporary work">
<text>Temporary work or temporary employment (also called gigs) refers to an employment situation where the working arrangement is limited to a certain period of time-based on the needs of the employing organization. Temporary employees are sometimes called &quot;contractual&quot;, &quot;seasonal&quot;, &quot;interim&quot;, &quot;casual staff&quot;, &quot;outsourcing&quot;, and &quot;freelance&quot;; or the words may be shortened to &quot;temps&quot;. In some instances, temporary, highly skilled professionals (particularly in the white-collar worker fields, such as human resources, research and development, engineering, and accounting) refer to themselves as consultants. Increasingly, executive-level positions (e.g., CEO, CIO, CFO, CMO, CSO) are also filled with interim executives or fractional executives.

Temporary work is different from secondment, which involves temporarily assigning a member of one organization to another. In this case, the employee typically retains their salary and other employment rights from their primary organization. Still, they work closely with other organizations to provide training and share experiences.

Temporary workers may work full-time or part-time depending on the individual situation. In some instances, temporary workers receive benefits (such as health insurance), but usually benefits are only given to permanent employees as a cost-cutting measure by the employer to save money. Not all temporary employees find jobs through a temporary employment agency. With the rise of the Internet and gig economy (a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs), many workers are now finding short-term jobs through freelance marketplaces: a situation that brings into being a global market for work.

A temporary work [[employment agency|agency]], temp agency or temporary staffing firm finds and retains workers. Other companies in need of short-term workers contract with the temporary work agency to send temporary workers, or temps, on assignments to work at the other companies. Temporary employees are also used in cyclical work, requiring frequent staffing adjustments.

==History==
 The staffing industry in the United States began after World War II with small agencies in urban areas employing housewives for part-time work as office workers. Over the years, the advantages of having workers who could be hired and laid off on short notice and were exempt from paperwork and regulatory requirements resulted in a gradual but substantial increase in temporary workers, with over 3.5 million employed in the United States by 2000.

There has been a paradigm shift since the 1940s in how firms utilize temporary workers. Throughout the Fordist era, temporary workers made up a rather marginal proportion of the total labor force in North America. Typically, temporary workers were white women in pink collar, clerical positions who provided companies with a stopgap solution for permanent workers who needed a leave of absence when on vacation or illness. In contrast, in the Post-Fordist period, characterized by neoliberalism, deindustrialization and the dismantling of the welfare state, these understandings of temporary labor began to shift. In this paradigm, the idea of the temporary worker as a stopgap solution to permanent labor became an entirely normative employment alternative to permanent work.

Therefore, temporary workers no longer represented a substitute for permanent workers on leave but became semi-permanent, precarious positions routinely subject to the threat of elimination because of company product fluctuations. In today&#x27;s temporary labor force, both people and positions have become temporary, and temporary agencies use the temporary workers systematically and plan instead of impromptu.

Temporary employment has become more prevalent in America due to the rise of the Internet and the gig economy. The &quot;gig economy&quot; is defined as a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work instead of permanent jobs. It is a common misconception that participation in the gig economy is a relatively new method of employment. However, finding work in the gig economy is similar to the employment style before the Industrial Revolution. It is the &quot;one-person, one-career model&quot; that society is accustomed to, and the gig economy is disrupting a relatively recent phenomenon. Before the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, it was common for one person to take on multiple temporary jobs to piece together livable earnings.

==Post-Fordism==
As the market began to transform from Fordism to a post-order regime of capital accumulation, the social regulation of labor markets and the very nature of work began to shift. This transformation has been characterized by an economic restructuring that emphasized flexibility within spaces of work, labor markets, employment relationships, wages and benefits. Indeed, global processes of neoliberalism and market rule contributed greatly to this increasing pressure on local labor markets towards flexibility. This greater flexibility within labor markets is important at the global level, particularly within OECD countries and liberal market economies (see liberal market economy).

The temporary labor industry is worth over €157 billion per year, and the most prominent agencies are spread across over 60 nations. The biggest temporary work agencies are most profitable in &quot;emerging&quot; economies of the Global North and those that have undergone market liberalization, deregulation, and (re)regulation.

Temporary work opportunities and restrictions vary around the world. Chile, Columbia, and Poland have the highest percentage of temporary dependent employment at 28.7%, 28.3%, and 27.5%, respectively. Romania, Lithuania, and Estonia have the lowest temporary dependent employment percentages, ranging from 1–4%. The United Kingdom has 6% temporary employment, Germany has 13% temporary employment, and France has 16% temporary employment. In many countries, there are no restrictions on the type of temporary work that is legal, including the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Sweden, and Denmark. The United Kingdom has in place the Temporary Agency Work Directive 2008, which ensures equal pay and treatment of temporary workers. Similarly, Brazil enforces full-time employment regulations to part-time employment and outsourcing. In some countries, including Brazil, there is a wage gap between temporary and permanent workers, but this is due to violations of legislation that specify equal wage determination. In other countries, prohibitions are placed on temporary employment in fields such as agriculture, construction, and non-core employment. In Mexico, a temporary employee is, &quot;prohibited to perform the same work as regular employee&quot;, making temporary work illegal.

Gig economy-based temporary work is prevalent around the world. Uber, for example, operates in North, Central, and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, East, South, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Airbnb advertises listings in 191 countries around the world with the most in Europe.

The desire to market flexible, adaptable temporary workers has become the temporary work industry&#x27;s driving, monetary-oriented objective. This has caused individual agencies to adopt practices that focus on competition with other firms, that promote &quot;try before you buy&quot; practices, and that maximize their ability to produce a product: the temporary worker. Through this process, the ideal temporary worker has today become largely imagined, produced, and marketed by temporary agencies.

==Agencies==
The role of a temp agency is as a third party between the client employer and the client employee. This third party handles remuneration, work scheduling, complaints, taxes, etc., created by the relationship between a client employer and a client employee. Client firms request the type of job that is to be done and the skills required to do it. Client firms can also terminate an assignment and file a complaint about the temp. Work schedules are determined by assignment, which is determined by the agency and can last for an indeterminate period, extended to any point, and cut short. Because the assignments are temporary, there is little incentive to provide benefits, and the pay is low in situations with a lot of labor flexibility. (Nurses are an exception to this since there is currently a shortage). Workers can refuse assignment but risk going through an indeterminate period of downtime since work is based on the availability of assignments, which the agency cannot &quot;create&quot;, only fill.

Whether the work comes through an independent gig economy source or a temp agency, when a temporary employee agrees to an assignment, they receive instructions pertaining to the job. The agency also provides information on correct work attire, work hours, wages, and whom to report to. If a temporary employee arrives at a job assignment and is asked to perform duties not described when they accepted the job, they may call an agency representative for clarification. If they choose not to continue on the assignment based on these discrepancies, they will most likely lose pay and may undermine chances at other job opportunities. However, some agencies guarantee an employee a certain number of hours of pay if there is no work once the temporary employee arrives or the work is not as described. Most agencies do not require an employee to continue work if the discrepancies make it difficult for the employee to do the work.

A &quot;temporary work agency&quot; may have a standard set of tests to judge the competence of the secretarial or clerical skills of an applicant. An applicant is hired based on their scores on these tests and is placed into a database. Companies or individuals looking to hire someone temporarily contact the agency and describe the skill set they are seeking. A temporary employee is then found in the database and is contacted to see if they would be interested in taking the assignment.

It is up to the temporary employee to keep in constant contact with the agency when not currently working on an assignment; by letting the agency know that they are available to work, they are given priority over those who may be in the agency database who have not made it clear that they are ready and willing to take an assignment. A temp agency employee is the exclusive employee of the agency, not of the company in which they are placed (although subject to legal dispute). The temporary employee is bound by the rules and regulations of the temp agency, even if they contrast with those of the company in which they are placed.

=== Benefits for client firms ===
There are several reasons as to why a firm utilizes temp agencies. They provide employers a way to add more workers for a short-term increase in the workforce. Using temps allows firms to replace a missing regular employee. A temp worker&#x27;s competency and value can be determined without the inflexibility of hiring a new person and seeing how they work out. Utilizing temp workers can also be a way of not having to pay benefits and increasing the salaries of regular employees. A firm can also use temp workers to vary compensation in what would normally be an illegal or impossible manner. The role of temp workers in the work space can also have the effects of coercing regular employees into taking more work for less pay. Additionally, temp workers are less likely to sue over mistreatment, which allows firms to reduce the costs of employment in high-stress, regulated jobs.

=== Growth of temporary staffing ===
Temp agencies are a growing part of industrial economies. From 1961 to 1971, the number of employees sent out by temporary staffing agencies increased by 16 percent. Temporary staffing industry payrolls increased by 166 percent from 1971 to 1981, 206 percent from 1981 to 1991, and 278 percent from 1991 to 1999. The temporary staffing sector accounted for 1 out of 12 new jobs in the 90&#x27;s. In 1996, there was $105 billion worldwide in staffing agency revenues. By 2008, $300 billion was generated worldwide in revenues for staffing agencies. The Temporary Staffing Industry accounts for 16% of job growth in the U.S. since the great recession ended, even though it only accounts for 2% of all-farm jobs.
This growth has occurred for several reasons. Demand for temporary employment can be primarily attributed to employers&#x27; demand, not employees. A large driver of demand was in European labor market. Previously, temporary employment agencies were considered quasi-legal entities. This reputation shied potential client employers away. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, a shift would be predominated by legal protections and closer relationships with primary employers. This, combined with the tendency for growth of the TSI in countries where there are strict regulations on dismissal of hired employees but loose regulations on temporary work, means that growth is much faster compared to industrialized nations without these labor conditions.

=== Abuse in the temporary staffing industry ===
Staffing agencies are prone to improper behavior just like any other employer. There have been cases of some temp agencies that have created and reinforced an ethnic hierarchy that determines who gets what jobs.

An additional ramification of temp workers &quot;guest&quot; status is at the bottom of the workplace hierarchy, which is visually identifiable on ID cards, in different colored uniforms, as well as the encouragement of more &quot;provocative dress&quot;. Their &quot;guest&quot; status often means temp workers are unable to access on-site workplace accommodations and are not included in meetings despite the length of their time working at the client firm.

This is all compounded by a working system in which temps must file complaints about clients through the temp agencies, which, often enough, disqualifies them not only from another assignment at that firm but also from receiving an assignment from that temporary agency upon review. Since a client firm is harder to replace than a client employee, and there is no disincentive to not give a complaining employee an assignment, there is an incentive for agencies to find employees who are willing to go along with the conditions of client firms, as opposed to severing ties with firms that routinely violate the law.

==Occupational safety and health==
Temporary workers are at a high risk of being injured or killed on the job. In the U.S., 829 fatal injuries (17% of all occupational fatalities) occurred among contract workers in 2015. Studies have also shown a higher burden of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses among temporary workers compared to those in standard employment arrangements. There are many possible contributing factors to the high rates of injuries and illnesses among temporary workers. They are often inexperienced and assigned to hazardous jobs and tasks, may be reluctant to object to unsafe working conditions or to advocate for safety measures due to fear of job loss or other repercussions, and they may lack basic knowledge and skills to protect themselves from workplace hazards due to insufficient safety training. According to a joint guidance document released by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), both staffing agencies and host employers (i.e., the clients of staffing agencies) are responsible for providing and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for temporary workers. Collaborative and interdisciplinary (e.g., epidemiology, occupational psychology, organizational science, economics, law, management, sociology, labor health and safety) research and intervention efforts are needed to protect and promote the occupational safety and health of temporary workers. In 2022, NIOSH and partners released a set of occupational safety and health best practices for host employers of temporary workers. Checklists to foster adoption of the best practices and a slide deck staffing companies can use to educate their host employer clients about the best practices are also included.

==Pros and cons==

===Pros===
* Easy hire: Those meeting technical requirements for the type of work are often virtually guaranteed a job without a selection process. In this sense, it could be argued that finding work as a temporary worker would be more accessible. Also, in some cases, agencies will hire temporary workers without submission of a résumé or an interview
* Potential for flexible hours which can lead to happier employees
* There is an opportunity to gain experience—companies are all unique, so the temporary worker will be exposed to a plethora of different situations and office procedures
* Some companies do not hire internally and use these staffing services only. They are an excellent gateway to get employment with a certain company.
* &quot;Try before you buy&quot;: temporary staff allows a business to try a worker as part of its team and confirm that they are a good fit before taking them on board long-term if needed.
* Temporary work can be extremely lucrative for those in less wealthy countries.
* Temporary work with internet of things-based companies offer a source of supplemental income.
* Temporary work may be a way in which someone who has retired can re-enter the workforce.

===Cons===
Workers, scholars, union organizers, and activists have identified many cons of temporary work, including the gig economy. These include:
* Lack of control over working hours and the potential for immediate termination for refusing an assigned schedule.
* Positions often are with high turnover rates. Research suggests that plants choose temporary workers over permanent ones when they expect output to fall, which allows them to avoid costs associated with laying off permanent employees
* &quot;Lack of reference&quot;, since many employers of experienced job positions do not consider work done for a temporary agency as sufficient on a résumé
* In the United States, the gradual replacement of workers by temporary workers resulted in millions of workers being employed in low-paid temporary jobs.
* In the U.S., the hourly wage paid to a temporary worker is 75% to 80% of what direct-hire employees are paid. Additionally, they often receive few or no employment benefits, such as health insurance, and seldom become full-time employees from their temporary positions.
* Unlike temporary workers hired through a staffing agency, many people in the gig economy do not report their income to the IRS, resulting in an estimated $214.6 billion in the United States alone of unreported income. This can result in fines or jail time.
* In South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, temporary workers often suffer from overworking.
* The temporary workforce can become oversaturated, leading to other issues such as wage deflation.
* When a company hires internationally, there is no legal precedent for using the laws of the hiring company&#x27;s country of origin or the temporary worker&#x27;s country of origin.

==Legal issues==
Scholars have argued that neoliberal policies have been prominent in erasing the standard employment relationship. This precarious new model of employment has greatly reduced the worker&#x27;s ability to negotiate and, in particular, with the introduction of advanced technology (that can easily replace the worker), reduced the temp&#x27;s bargaining power. Internet of Things-based companies such as Uber and Handy have come into conflict with authorities and workers for circumventing labor and social security obligations. It has been suggested that labour regulations in North America do little in addressing labour market insecurities and the precarious nature of temporary labour. In many cases, legislation has done little to acknowledge or adapt to the growth of non-standard employment in Canada.

California Assembly Bill 5 in 2019 addressed the issue of contract workers, including those in the gig economy, and set stricter requirements that must be satisfied for a worker to be classified as a contractor and not an employee, as employees receive more worker protection and benefits than contractors. In 2018, Kentucky (HB 220), Utah, Indiana (HB 1286), Iowa (SF 2257), and Tennessee (SB 1967) passed laws specifying certain on-demand gig economy workers as &quot;marketplace contractors&quot; and classifying them as independent contractors.

In the European Union, temporary work is regulated by the Temporary Agency Work Directive and the Member States&#x27; laws implementing that directive.

Lawsuits have addressed some of the controversies about the status of temporary workers in the sharing economy. For example, two class-action lawsuits settled in 2016 resulted in changes to Uber&#x27;s employment policies, including clarification of drivers&#x27; rights and the company&#x27;s disciplinary procedures. Some of these policies include Uber agreeing to issue warnings to drivers before cutting them from the company&#x27;s service, no longer deactivating drivers who commonly refuse rides, informing customers that tips for drivers are not included in the fare, and allowing drivers to create an association to contest terminations. However, the legal settlement did not establish whether these workers are employees or independent contractors.

<text>A teleprompter, also known as an autocue, is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or script.

Using a teleprompter is similar to using cue cards. The screen is in front of, and usually below, the lens of a professional video camera, and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the presenter using a sheet of clear glass or other beam splitter, so that they are read by looking directly at the lens position, but are not imaged by the lens. Light from the performer passes through the front side of the glass into the lens, while a shroud surrounding the lens and the back side of the glass prevents unwanted light from entering the lens. Optically this works in a very similar way to the Pepper&#x27;s ghost illusion from classic theatre: an image viewable from one angle but not another.

Because the speaker can look straight at the lens while reading the script, the teleprompter creates the illusion that the speaker has memorized the speech or is speaking spontaneously, looking directly into the camera lens. Notes or cue cards, on the other hand, require the presenter to look at them instead of at the lens, which can cause the speaker to appear distracted, depending on the degree of deflection from the natural line of sight to the camera lens, and how long the speaker needs to glance away to glean the next speaking point; speakers who can internalize a full sentence or paragraph in a single short glance timed to natural breaks in the spoken cadence will create only a small or negligible impression of distraction.

The technology has continued to develop, including the following iterations: 
* first mechanical paper roll teleprompters — used by television presenters and speakers at U.S. political conventions in 1952
* dual glass teleprompters — used by TV presenters and for U.S. conventions in 1964 
* computer-based rolls of 1982 and the four-prompter system for U.S. conventions — added a large off-stage confidence monitor and inset lectern monitor in 1996
* replacement of glass teleprompters at U.K. political conferences by several large off-stage confidence monitors in 2006.

 in the US and Autocue in Commonwealth and some European countries were originally trade names but have become genericized trademarks used for any such display device.

==History==
The TelePrompTer Corporation was founded in the 1950s by Fred Barton, Jr., Hubert Schlafly and Irving Berlin Kahn. Barton was an actor who suggested the concept of the teleprompter as a means of assisting television performers who had to memorize large amounts of material in a short time.
Schlafly built the first teleprompter in 1950. It was simply a mechanical device, operated by a hidden technician, located near the camera. The script, in inch-high letters, was printed by a special electric typewriter on a paper scroll, which was advanced as the performer read, and the machines rented for the then-considerable sum of $30 per hour.

The teleprompter was used for the first time on December 4, 1950, in filming the CBS soap &quot;The First Hundred Years&quot;. It was used by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in 1953 to read commercials on-camera. Jess Oppenheimer, who created &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and served for its first five years as its producer and head writer, developed the first &quot;in-the-lens&quot; prompter and was awarded U.S. patents for its creation. His system uses a mirror to reflect a script onto a piece of glass placed in front of the camera lens, thus allowing the reader to look directly into the camera.

The producers of &quot;Dragnet&quot; estimated the use of teleprompters cut the show&#x27;s production time by as much as 50% Arthur Godfrey, Raymond Massey, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, and Helen Hayes were early users of the technology.

The technology soon became a staple of television news and is the primary system used by newscasters today.

In 1952 former President Herbert Hoover used a Schlafly-designed speech teleprompter to address the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago. U.S. Governor Paul A. Dever spoke at the 1952 Democratic National Convention, also held in Chicago, using a mechanical-roll teleprompter on a long pole held by a TV technician in the convention audience, while the 1952 Republican National Convention used a smaller teleprompter placed in front of the speaker&#x27;s rostrum. Mechanical prompters were still being used as late as 1992.

In the early years of teleprompter use by politicians, some saw the device as cheating. in 1955, Richard L. Neuberger, a Democratic Senator from Oregon, proposed legislation that if a politician used a teleprompter the use of the device had to be noted in the speech.
The new technology saw quick adoption in the sponsored film industry where cutting production costs made the difference between a film that made money and one that lost money. Cinécraft Productions was the first to advertise the availability of three-camera synchronized filming with a teleprompter when in 1954 they began to advertise their use of the new technology in &quot;Business Screen&quot;, a magazine dedicated to the sponsored film industry. Cinécraft used the technique to film the 1953–1960 weekly television series &quot;The Ohio Story&quot;. Cinécraft also used the technique for executive &quot;desk talks&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s.

On January 4, 1954, Dwight Eisenhower was the first President to use a teleprompter for a State of the Union address.

The first personal computer-based teleprompter, CompuPrompt, appeared in 1982. It was invented and marketed by Courtney M. Goodin and Laurence B. Abrams in Los Angeles, California. The custom software and specially-redesigned camera hardware ran on the Atari 800 computer, which featured smooth hardware-assisted scrolling. Their company later became ProPrompt, Inc., still in business . Paper-based teleprompting companies Electronic Script Prompting, QTV, and Telescript followed suit and developed their own software several years later when computers powerful enough to scroll text smoothly became available. In January 2010 Compu=Prompt received a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for &quot;Pioneering Development in Electronic Prompting&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;TelePrompTer&quot;, with internal capitalization, originated as a trade name used by the TelePrompTer Corporation, which first developed the device in the 1950s. The word &quot;teleprompter&quot;, with no capitalization, has become a genericized trademark, because it is used to refer to similar systems manufactured by many different companies. Some other common terms for this type of device are:
* Autocue, the trademark of Autocue Group Ltd, most commonly used in Commonwealth countries
* Autoscript is used to brand the devices in the United States
* cueing device
* electronic speech notes
* idiot board (slang)
* prompter

==Modern design==

===Television===

Modern teleprompters for news programs consist of a personal computer, connected to video monitors on each professional video camera. In certain systems, the PC connects to a separate display device to offer greater flexibility in setup, distances, and cabling. The monitors are often black-and-white and have the scanning reversed to compensate for the reflection of the mirror. A peripheral device attached has a knob that can be turned to speed up, slow down, or even reverse the scrolling of the text. The text is usually displayed in white letters on a black background for the best readability, while cues are in inverse video (black on white). Difficult words (mainly international names) are spelled out phonetically, as are other particulars like &quot;Nine-eleven&quot; (to specify that the event 9/11 should not be pronounced &quot;nine-one-one&quot;, for example).

With the development of inexpensive teleprompter software applications as well as free Web-based teleprompter applets, many different disciplines are now using teleprompters to help them deliver sermons, deliver speeches, and create quality audio recordings. Unlike their more advanced counterparts, these entry-level products work on desktop computers, laptop computers, and even tablet computers to enable the speaker to control the rate and flow of their speech. They are also used by many different organizations and schools to deliver prewritten information by relative novices. They are usually called &quot;personal teleprompters&quot;.

Glass teleprompters were first used at the 1956 Democratic National Convention. The inventor of the teleprompter, Hubert Schlafly, explained that he wanted to create a less obtrusive teleprompting system than the ones used at the time. He said, &quot;We developed a &#x27;one-way mirror&#x27; device we called the &quot;Speech View&quot; system... The prompter, hidden in the base, reflected the text on the glass to the speaker while the audience looked through the glass without being aware of the text. Two such prompters, one on the right and one on the left of the speaker allowed him to switch from one to the other and appear to address the entire audience&quot;.

Schlafly&#x27;s company then created a speaker&#x27;s lectern that included two synchronized glass teleprompters and a range of technological innovations including air conditioning and an adjustable-height speaker&#x27;s platform. The success of the system led the company to develop a new model for use on TV cameras, with the glass placed directly in front of the lens. The camera &quot;looked through the glass; the performer looked directly at the TV audience and was able to read the text word for word. This device now has worldwide use&quot;.

Typically, a screen on either side of the speaker shows mirrored text from upward-facing floor monitors at the base of a stand supporting a one-way mirror at the top, angled down towards the screen. The speaker sees the text on the screen reflected in the mirror, while the audience sees what looks like a sheet of tinted glass on each side of the speaker.

Schlafly&#x27;s glass teleprompters were also used for the 1956 Republican National Convention, and at both parties&#x27; conventions from then on. In 1964, glass teleprompters were used by Robert F. Kennedy, at the time the Attorney General, who served in both the Kennedy and early Johnson Administrations (1961–1964), to deliver his convention speech.

===Confidence monitors===
In 1996, for the first time, speakers at the Democratic National Convention, held at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, used a four-teleprompter system: as can be seen at another convention in image (A), the first three prompters are placed to the left, right and in front of the speaker, the latter embedded within the speaker&#x27;s lectern, enabling the speaker to look down at the lectern without losing their place in the text of the speech; while in image (B), the fourth prompter is a large confidence monitor located immediately below the lenses of the TV broadcast cameras, at a distance of several meters/yards from the speaker.

This modification to the traditional two-teleprompter set-up continues to be in use at both the Democratic and Republican parties&#x27; national conventions: the two glass teleprompters on either side of the speaker&#x27;s lectern create the illusion that the speaker is looking directly at the audience in the hall, the monitor embedded in the lectern, together with the fourth, much larger teleprompter screen, known as a &quot;confidence monitor&quot;, placed immediately below the broadcast TV cameras which are located some distance away from the convention stage on a specially-constructed broadcasting gantry. This placement of the center prompter creates the illusion that the speaker is periodically looking straight into the camera lens and thereby appears to directly address the TV audience watching the televised Convention coverage.

In 2006, speakers at the Liberal Democrat Conference, held at the Brighton Centre in Brighton, UK also used a three-screen system (but this time consisting entirely of large off-stage confidence monitors mounted on poles — which are often described outside North America, together with glass teleprompters, as &quot;autocues&quot;), where the skill required for those using it, according to the Liberal Democrats&#x27; former leader, Menzies Campbell (2006—2008), is to move their gaze seamlessly from one screen to the other: left, center (near the broadcast TV cameras), right and then back again.

As well as helping the speaker to appear to sometimes directly address the TV audience during his or her speech, this system allows the speaker – in another case cited, the party&#x27;s then-new leader, Nick Clegg (2008–2015) – to abandon the podium lectern and roam the stage, speaking with apparent spontaneity but in fact constantly assisted by three large autocue screens placed throughout the conference hall. Ironically, this use of the system was adopted by Clegg to counter the oratorical success of another party leader, David Cameron (later to become British Prime Minister), who bestrode stages while speaking seemingly off-the-cuff, having memorized key parts of his speech.

This use of multiple off-stage confidence monitors also dispenses with the need for glass teleprompters to be present on the conference stage, thereby reducing &quot;stage clutter&quot;, and removing the inevitable restrictions on the speaker&#x27;s movement and field of vision imposed by on-stage glass prompters. The disadvantage of such a system is that the provision of &quot;giant teleprompters&quot; becomes essential to maintaining the illusion of speaking with apparent spontaneity.

<doc id="441392" wikidata="Q692412" url="?curid=441392" title="Trade war">
<text>A trade war is an economic conflict often resulting from extreme protectionism in which states raise or create tariffs or other trade barriers against each other in response to trade barriers created by the other party. If tariffs are the exclusive mechanism, then such conflicts are known as customs wars, &quot;toll wars&quot;, or &quot;tariff wars&quot;; as a reprisal, the latter state may also increase the tariffs. Trade war arises only if the competitive protection between states is of the same type and it is not valid in case of dumping exports. Increased protection causes both nations&#x27; output compositions to move towards their autarky position. Minor trade disagreements are often called trade disputes when the war metaphor is hyperbolic.

Trade wars could be escalated to full conflict between states as evidenced in the Massacre of the Bandanese after alleged violations of a new treaty. The First Anglo-Dutch War was caused by disputes over trade; the war began with English attacks on Dutch merchant shipping but expanded to vast fleet actions. The Second Anglo-Dutch War was for control over the seas and trade routes, where England tried to end the Dutch domination of world trade during a period of intense European commercial rivalry. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War started over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain&#x27;s enemies in that war. The Shimonoseki Campaign after unrest over the shogunate&#x27;s open-door policy to foreign trade. The First Opium War which started after the Qing government blockaded its ports, confiscated opium contraband and confined British traders, resulted in the dispatch of the British Navy to China and engage the Chinese Navy in the Battle of Kowloon. The First Opium War eventually led to the British colony of Hong Kong, and the Second Opium War, which arose from another trade war with the same underlying causes, expanded the British possessions on the island.

==Exploration of an example (1920s)==
One example of a modern tariff war occurred in the 1920s and 1930s between the Weimar Republic and Poland, in the German–Polish customs war. The Weimar Republic, led by Gustav Stresemann, wanted to force Poland to give up its territory by creating an economic crisis. To achieve this, they increased the tolls for coal and steel products developed there. As a reprisal, the Poles increased toll rates for many German products. This led to fast development of the port of Gdynia, which was the only way Poland could export its goods to Western Europe without having to transport them through Germany.

In September 1922, the Fordney–McCumber Tariff (named after Joseph Fordney, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Porter McCumber, chair of the Senate Finance Committee) was signed by U.S. President Warren G. Harding. In the end, the tariff law raised the average American ad valorem tariff rate to 38 percent.

Trading partners complained immediately. Those injured by World War I said that, without access by their exports to the American market, they would not be able to make payments to America on war loans. But others saw that this tariff increase would have broader deleterious effects. Democratic Representative Cordell Hull said, &quot;Our foreign markets depend both on the efficiency of our production and the tariffs of countries in which we would sell. Our own [high] tariffs are an important factor in each. They injure the former and invite the latter.&quot;

Five years after the passage of the tariff, American trading partners had raised their own tariffs by a significant degree. France raised its tariffs on automobiles from 45% to 100%, Spain raised tariffs on American goods by 40%, and Germany and Italy raised tariffs on wheat. This customs war is often cited as one of the main causes of the Great Depression.

<text>Trade barriers are government-induced restrictions on international trade. According to the theory of comparative advantage, trade barriers are detrimental to the world economy and decrease overall economic efficiency.

Most trade barriers work on the same principle: the imposition of some sort of cost (money, time, bureaucracy, quota) on trade that raises the price or availability of the traded products. If two or more nations repeatedly use trade barriers against each other, then a trade war results. Barriers take the form of tariffs (which impose a financial burden on imports) and non-tariff barriers to trade (which uses other overt and covert means to restrict imports and occasionally exports). In theory, free trade involves the removal of all such barriers, except perhaps those considered necessary for health or national security. In practice, however, even those countries promoting free trade heavily subsidize certain industries, such as agriculture and steel.

==Overview==
High-income countries tend to have fewer trade barriers than middle income countries which, in turn, tend to have fewer trade barriers than low income countries. Small states tend to have lower trade barriers than large states. The most common trade barriers are on agricultural goods. Textiles, apparel and footwear are the manufactured goods which are most commonly protected by trade barriers. Tariffs have been declining in the last twenty years as the influence of the World Trade Organization has grown, but states have increased their use of non-tariff barriers.

According to Chad Bown and Meredith Crowley, world trade is &quot;probably&quot; vastly more liberal in current times than was the case historically. According to Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O’Rourke, &quot;for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries trade barriers and transport costs were the most important barriers to trade&quot;. They also write, &quot;during the mercantilist era price gaps were as likely to be due to trade monopolies, pirates, and wars as to transport costs and tariffs, which are more easily quantifiable.&quot;

Georgetown University Professor Marc L. Busch and McGill University Professor Krzysztof J. Pelc note that modern trade deals are long and complex because they often tackle non-tariff barriers to trade, such as different standards and regulations, in addition to tariffs. Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since World War II, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in forms other than tariffs. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms, and modern trade deals are one way to do away with such regulations.

The barriers can take many forms, including the following:

* Tariffs
* Non-tariff barriers to trade include:
** Import licenses
** Export control / licenses
** Import quotas
** Subsidies
** Voluntary Export Restraints
** Local content requirements
** Embargo
** Currency devaluation
** Trade restriction

==Impacts of trade barriers on business==

Trade barriers are often criticized for the effect they have on the developing world. Because rich-countries are able to set trade policies, goods, such as crops that developing countries are best at producing, still face high barriers. Trade barriers such as tariffs on food imports or subsidies for farmers in developed economies lead to overproduction and dumping on world markets, thus lowering world prices to the disadvantage of farmers in developing economies who typically do not benefit from such subsidies. The Commitment to Development Index measures the effect that rich country trade policies actually have on the developing world.

Trade barriers are mostly a combination of conformity and per-shipment requirements requested abroad, and weak inspection or certification procedures at home. The impact of trade barriers on companies and countries is highly uneven. One particular study showed that small firms are most affected (over 50%).

Another negative aspect of trade barriers is that they result in a limited choice of products and would therefore force customers to pay higher prices and accept inferior quality.

Trade barriers obstruct free trade. Before exporting or importing to other countries, firstly, they must be aware of restrictions that the government imposes on the trade. Subsequently, they need to make sure that they are not violating the restrictions by checking related regulations on tax or duty, and finally they probably need a license in order to ensure a smooth export or import business and reduce the risk of penalty or violation. Sometimes the situation becomes even more complicated with the changing of policy and restrictions of a country.

<doc id="441401" wikidata="Q904201" url="?curid=441401" title="Parody religion">
<text>A parody religion or mock religion is a belief system that challenges the spiritual convictions of others, often through humor, satire, or burlesque (literary ridicule). Often constructed to achieve a specific purpose related to another belief system, a parody religion can be a parody of several religions, sects, gurus, cults, or new religious movements at the same time, or even a parody of no particular religion – instead parodying the concept of religious belief itself. Some parody religions emphasise having fun; the new faith may serve as a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among the like-minded.

One approach of parody religions aims to highlight deficiencies in particular pro-religious arguments – following the logic that if a given argument can also be used to support a clear parody, then the original argument is clearly flawed. This can be done through fictional religions found in many works of fiction - one example of this can be the Bokononism from the novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (1963) by Kurt Vonnegut. Another example of this is the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which parodies the demand for equal time employed by intelligent design and creationism.

Occasionally, a parody religion may offer ordination by mail or on-line at a nominal fee, seeking equal recognition for its clergy/officiants – under freedom of religion provisions, including the 1st and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution – to legally solemnise marriages. Parody religions also have sought the same reasonable accommodation legally afforded to mainstream religions, including religious-specific garb or headgear. A U.S. federal court ruled in 2016 that the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (&quot;Pastafarianism&quot;) is not a religion, but Pastafarianism or &quot;The Church of the Latter-Day Dude&quot; (Dudeism) have been accommodated to some extent by a few U.S. states and by some other countries.

Several religions that are considered as parody religions have a number of relatively serious followers who embrace the perceived absurdity of these religions as spiritually significant, a decidedly post-modern approach to religion. Since 2005, scholars of new religious movements have come to consider Discordianism as having a &quot;complex and subtle religious system&quot;, concluding that &quot;Discordianism can no longer be considered a purely parodic religion.&quot;

==List of notable parody religions==

=== Parodies of particular beliefs ===

The following were created as parodies of particular religious beliefs:
=== Post-modern religions ===
The following post-modern religions that may be seen as elaborate parodies of already-existent religions:
== Aspects ==

=== Beliefs ===
Parody religions are often created to satirize or mock established religions, and as such, their beliefs often reflect this satirical or humorous tone. Parody religions may also use their beliefs as a means of commenting on societal issues or political ideologies. The Church of the SubGenius, for instance, pokes fun at organized religion and American culture through its parodic depiction of a &quot;mock religion&quot; that celebrates slackness and absurdity. Other parody religions target specific religions, sects, or cults and craft their beliefs to mock those of the religion they are targeting.

One common belief found in many parody religions is the rejection of dogma and religious authority. Parody religions often portray themselves as free-thinking and open-minded, rejecting the idea of blind faith and instead encouraging critical thinking and skepticism.

Parody religions may also incorporate elements of pop culture or science fiction into their beliefs. For example, The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, a parody religion that originated in response to the teaching of intelligent design in schools, posits that a flying spaghetti monster created the universe. Similarly, the Jediism movement, which began as a parody religion but has since become more serious, is based on the beliefs and practices of the Jedi Order from the Star Wars franchise.

=== Practices ===
Similar to many other religions, the practices of parody religions can include rituals, sermons, meditation, prayer, commemoration of a deity or god, sacrifices, parades, festivals, holidays, initiations, marital ceremonies, religious music &amp; art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture.

Parody religions often use their practices as a way to further satirize or critique established religious practices, or as a way to create a sense of community and belonging among their followers. Parody religions may also use their practices to highlight societal issues or political ideologies.

One common practice found in many parody religions is the use of humor and satire in religious ceremonies and rituals. The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, for example, often includes a &quot;noodle mass&quot; in which followers consume spaghetti and meatballs as a form of communion. The Church of the SubGenius also uses humor in its ceremonies, with rituals that include mock baptisms and the &quot;slack off&quot; ritual in which followers are encouraged to relax and do nothing.

Parody religions may also incorporate elements of pop culture or science fiction into their practices. The Jediism movement, for instance, practices lightsaber training and meditation, inspired by the Jedi Order from the Star Wars franchise. The Church of the Latter-Day Dude, a parody religion based on the character from the film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; practices &quot;dudeist&quot; philosophy and encourages followers to take it easy and &quot;abide.&quot;

In addition to these unique practices, many parody religions also incorporate elements of more traditional religions into their practices. The Church of the SubGenius, for instance, uses elements of Christianity, Hinduism, and other religions in its rituals and iconography.

=== Social organization ===
Parody religions often have unique social structures and organizations that reflect their satirical or humorous tone. Parody religions may also use their social organization to create a sense of community and belonging among their followers, or as a way to comment on societal issues or political ideologies.

One common aspect of parody religions is that they often lack a centralized hierarchy or leadership structure. Instead, many parody religions operate as decentralized communities, with individual followers taking on roles and responsibilities as needed. For example, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has no official leaders, and instead relies on a community of individuals to organize events and spread the message of the religion.

Parody religions may also use their social organization to comment on societal issues or political ideologies. The Church of Euthanasia, for example, encourages its followers to live a sustainable lifestyle and reduce their environmental impact, and has organized protests and demonstrations to raise awareness for these issues.

== Usage by atheist commentators ==
Many atheists, including Richard Dawkins, use parody religions such as those of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Invisible Pink Unicorn – as well as ancient gods like Zeus and Thor – as modern versions of Russell&#x27;s teapot to argue that the burden of proof is on the believer, not the atheist.

Dawkins also created a parody of the criticism of atheism, coining the term &quot;athorism&quot;, or the firm belief that the Norse deity Thor does not exist. The intention is to emphasize that atheism is not a form of religious creed, but merely denial of specific beliefs.
A common challenge against atheism is the idea that atheism is itself a form of &quot;faith&quot;, a belief without proof. The theist might say &quot;No one can &quot;prove&quot; that God &quot;does not&quot; exist, therefore an atheist is exercising faith by asserting that there is no God.&quot; Dawkins argues that by replacing the word &quot;God&quot; with &quot;Thor&quot; one should see that the assertion is fallacious. The burden of proof, he claims, rests upon the believer in the supernatural, not upon the non-believer who considers such things unlikely. Athorism is an attempt to illustrate through absurdity that there is no logical difference between disbelieving particular religions.

== Legal issues ==
Cavanaugh v. Bartelt et al.: Stephen Cavanaugh, an inmate at the Nebraska State Penitentiary, sued prison officials for refusing to accommodate his religious rights and requests, such as &quot;the ability to order and wear religious clothing and pendants, the right to meet for weekly worship services and classes and the right to receive communion.&quot; Cavanaugh identifies as a Pastafarian and practices FSMism. Cavanaugh claimed that by prison officials rejecting his requests, his First Amendment Right was violated. Ultimately, the Court found that FSMism could not be defined as a religion under federal statutes and they granted the defendants&#x27; motion to dismiss.

Netherlands and The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster: In 2018, the Dutch court ruled that law student Mienke de Wilde did not qualify for religious exemption in wearing Pastafarian headwear for a government issued ID photo. The court claimed that &quot;Pastafarianism lacked the seriousness and coherence of a legitimate religious faith.&quot;

<doc id="441415" wikidata="Q326571" url="?curid=441415" title="Lester Thurow">
<text>Lester Carl Thurow (May 7, 1938 – March 25, 2016) was an American political economist, former dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of books on economic topics.

==Education==
Born in Livingston, Montana, Thurow received his B.A. in political economy from Williams College in 1960, where he was in Theta Delta Chi and Phi Beta Kappa as a junior, and a Tyng Scholar. After he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, he went to Balliol College, Oxford to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in 1962 with first class honors. He received a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1964.

==Career==
Thurow was on the board of directors of Analog Devices, Grupo Casa Autrey, E-Trade, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC). Thurow was one of the founders of the Economic Policy Institute in 1986. Thurow was an economics columnist for, among others, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. He was an economics columnist for and on the editorial board of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and was a contributing editor to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, where he earned the 1982 Gerald Loeb Award for Columns/Editorials.

Thurow was a longtime advocate of a political and economic system of the Japanese and European type, in which governmental involvement in the direction of the economy is far more extensive than is the case in the United States – a model that has come to be known as &quot;Third Way&quot; philosophy. Thurow supported a more universal patent system as a requirement for a knowledge-based economy, where governments would assess the value of infringements of intellectual property against their companies by competitors in foreign jurisdictions and allow these companies to match that.

Thurow died at the age of 77 on March 25, 2016.

==Books==
His 1993 book, &quot;Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe and America&quot; compares economic growth and living standards in Japan, Europe, and the U.S.
His other books include:
* &quot;Fortune Favors the Bold: What we must do to build a new and lasting global prosperity&quot; (2003).
* &quot;Building Wealth: The new rules&quot; (1999).
* &quot;The Future of Capitalism: How today&#x27;s economic forces shape tomorrow&#x27;s world&quot; (1996).

<text>Achim Gercke (3 August 1902 – 27 October 1997) was a German politician.

Born in Greifswald, Gercke was the son of the classical philologist Alfred Gercke. After pursuing an academic career, he became a department head of the NSDAP in Munich on 1 January 1932. In April 1933 he was appointed to the Ministry of the Interior, where he served as an expert on racial matters.

Gercke devised the system of &quot;racial prophylaxis&quot;, forbidding the intermarriage between Jews and Aryans. As a student, he had attempted to develop a card index listing all Jews in Germany. His articles outlined Nazi policy on what to do to the Jews during the early phase of the Third Reich, which included expulsion from Germany. He described the just-enacted Nuremberg Laws restricting Jews as provisional measures, which indicated the direction future measures would take. Gercke argued for defining &quot;Jew&quot; as including any person with one-sixteenth Jewish blood. Later in 1942, the Wannsee Conference ultimately defined &quot;Jew&quot; quite differently: Persons having one Jewish grandparent were mostly excluded and even certain persons with two Jewish grandparents might be excluded, if they followed the Christian faith.

In 1932, Nazi Gauleiter Rudolf Jordan claimed that SS Security Chief Reinhard Heydrich was not a pure &quot;Aryan&quot;. Within the Nazi organisation such innuendo could be damning, even for the head of the Reich&#x27;s counterintelligence service. Gregor Strasser passed the allegations on to Achim Gercke who investigated Heydrich&#x27;s genealogy. Gercke reported that Heydrich was &quot;... of German origin and free from any coloured and Jewish blood&quot;. He insisted that the rumours were baseless. Even with this report, Heydrich privately engaged SD member Ernst Hoffman to further investigate and deny the rumours.

In 1935, Gercke was dismissed following allegations of homosexuality. After the war, he worked as an archivist and town clerk.

<doc id="441421" wikidata="Q383718" url="?curid=441421" title="Ecologist Green Party of Mexico">
<text>The Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (, , PVEM or PVE) is a green political party in Mexico. Founded in 1986, the party is associated with Jorge González Torres and his son Jorge Emilio González Martínez.
It has seldom gotten more than 10% of the vote nationwide, but in the 21st century has joined alliances with all major parties. It allied with PAN in the federal elections of 2000, PRI from 2003 to 2018, and most recently Morena from 2019 to present. 

It is not recognized as a fellow green party by the European Green Party, and is known for its heavy use of advertising. The party has previously taken stances on issues not usually associated with the international Green movement such as support for capital punishment, extension of school hours, and opposition to LGBT rights. It has been criticized for lacking a clear ideology, prioritizing corporate interests over environmental concerns, and violating campaign laws.

==History==
The party was founded in 1986 under the name Mexican Green Party () and its first leader was Jorge González Torres. It participated in the 1991 federal elections for the first time as an independent bloc, under the name Ecologist Party of Mexico (). It did not obtain a sufficient percentage of the vote to obtain official registration at the national level. It obtained its registration in 1993 and in the same year the party changed its name to the current one.

From when it obtained its first subnational registration as a political party on 28 February 1991 until 2011, it was controlled by a single family: its first president was founder Jorge González Torres (a public official and former member of the PRI), who was succeeded in the presidency of the party by his son, Jorge Emilio González Martínez (who served as a senator from 2000–2006 and was nicknamed &quot;the Green Child&quot;) in 2001.

The party slowly increased its vote share through the 1990s, finishing in 5th place in the 1994 legislative elections and 4th place in 1997, obtaining its first seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate in the latter. 

Starting in 2000 it allegedly adopted the strategy of &quot;siding with the political party most likely to win&quot;, and changing its political coloration to match that party.
It participated in the 2000 Mexican general election in the Alliance for Change with the National Action Party (PAN), resulting in the successful election of joint presidential candidate Vicente Fox and the obtaining of the most seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the senate between the two parties (although they lacked a majority). The PVEM eventually distanced itself from the PAN and Fox the following year after stating their belief that they were not complying with established agreements on environmental matters.

In the 2003 Mexican legislative election, the party allied with the PRI in 100 of the 300 constituency seats as the , with the PVEM winning 17 constituency seats and 14 proportional representation seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and 1 constituency seat and 4 proportional representation seats in the Senate. Initially intending to run its own candidate, Bernardo de la Garza, in the 2006 presidential election, the party eventually withdrew in support of the PRI&#x27;s candidate Roberto Madrazo, who finished in 3rd place. From this point, the PVEM continued to ally with the PRI for most elections until 2019.

In the 2009 Mexican legislative election, the party campaigned in favor of the death penalty for murderers and kidnappers, the extension of school hours to relieve childcare concerns for working parents, and free medicines. Its support for the death penalty led to its being ejected from a group of international Green Parties that year.

Later, in the 2012 general election, the PRI-PVEM alliance&#x27;s presidential candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto, was victorious, with the PVEM improving its results in the legislature (taking 34 seats in the Chamber of Deputies out of 500 and nine seats in the Senate out of 128) and entering into a state government for the first time as part of a coalition with the PRI and PANAL in Chiapas, also winning the governorship for the first time under candidate Manuel Velasco Coello. It remained a part of the Chiapas state government until 2018. 

In the 2015 election campaign, the Instituto Nacional Electoral or INE (which is responsible for organizing elections) fined the Green Party more than 500 million pesos (approximately US$32 million dollars) for different electoral violations. More than 155,000 Mexicans signed an online petition calling for the INE to revoke the Green party&#x27;s registration, but Mexico&#x27;s electoral tribunal declined to do so. 

In 2018, PVEM supported the Todos por México coalition, along with PRI and PANAL. José Antonio Meade, the coalition&#x27;s candidate, came in third in a four-way race, with 16.43% of the vote. PVEM later withdrew from Todos por Mexico and gradually came close to the Andrés Manuel López Obrador government, formally entering the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition in 2019. In December 2020 it founded the successor Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition, together with the National Regeneration Movement and the Labor Party and contested the 2021 Mexican legislative elections with them. The PVEM also won its second gubernatorial election the same year, with Ricardo Gallardo Cardona finishing in first place in San Luis Potosí.

==Ideology==

The party has been described (by Lorena Rios) as showing &quot;remarkable ideological flexibility&quot;, with a explained not by concern over pollution and global warming, but by the fact that as a political party in Mexico it receives public financing from the Mexican federal government (it received 7.4 billion pesos, or approximately US$370 million, in financing from 1997 to mid-2021).

Originally portraying itself as a green conservative party, the PVEM has sought to shift toward the progressive centre-left in the 2020s, although a conservative faction remains. The party has been criticized on a few occasions for a perceived lack of true commitment to environmental causes, with the now-defunct Mexico City newspaper &quot;El Independiente&quot; reporting that during a meeting he held in London with Mexican graduate students, party leader Jorge González Martínez responded to the question of PVEM&#x27;s programs in defense of the Mexican environment with &quot;Ecology is the least important thing to me. I represent interests&quot;, and González Martínez being accused of accepting bribes to overlook construction occurring in protected areas. It allied itself with the MORENA party in 2019, despite the &quot;notorious disregard&quot; for environmentalism and the transition away from carbon fuels by the leader of that party.
The party came out in support of remote work, the creation of special economic zones, and a transition to a semi-presidential system of government in its 2018 manifesto.

==Controversies==
Among the general criticisms of the party have been that it is &quot;a family firm ‘bordering on organised crime’&quot; (Jorge Alcocer Varela), its “&#x27;green&#x27; is in the branding, not the policy&quot; (Lorena Rios), and that while other parties in Mexico are susceptible to corruption, the Green Party is &quot;corruption turned into a party&quot; (Emilio Lezama in &quot;El Universal&quot;). Others insist its relative success comes from &quot;out-strategizing&quot; its rivals and giving the public proposals it wants.

===Pro-death penalty campaign===

In 2008, the PVEM initiated an advertising campaign in favor of reintroducing the death penalty in Mexico. This led to the European Green Party&#x27;s withdrawal of recognition of the PVEM as a legitimate green party.

===Anti-LGBT rights factions===
During an interview, PVEM candidate Gamaliel Ramirez verbally attacked an openly gay candidate for Guadalajara mayor and called for criminal laws against homosexuality to be established. In the following days, Ramirez issued a written apology after the party expressed disappointment at his remarks.

While the party has pledged to support LGBT rights issues, its three representatives abstained from a vote on Mexico City granting legal recognition to same-sex couples and opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in the city.

===Accusations of corruption and nepotism===
The PVEM is also widely criticized because its leader from 2001 to 2011, Jorge Emilio González Martínez, was appointed for being the son of former leader Jorge González Torres, and for supporting the political and business agenda of Mexican businessman Víctor González Torres, owner of the &quot;Farmacias Similares&quot; drugstore franchise and González Martínez&#x27;s uncle. As of 2021, the father and son retain influence as members of the party’s national council. González Martínez was also accused of accepting bribes in exchange for allowing construction in protected areas. A 2004 video of Jorge Emilio Gonzalez appears to show him negotiating a payment in exchange for developing a hotel in Cancun on ecologically sensitive lands. He denied any wrongdoing.

Green Party Senator Arturo Escobar y Vega was stopped in a Chiapas airport prior to the 2009 elections &quot;with $1 million pesos in a Louis Vuitton bag&quot;, but denied the money was his and was released. 

In 14 June 2021, an anti-corruption group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity (MCCI), reported that the Mexican government had detected a scheme in which the 2012–2018 Green Party-run Chiapas state government led by governor Manuel Velasco Coello appeared to have embezzled more than 500 million pesos of public money. However, the federal government had not initiated legal action against any officials who served in the administration, according to an anti-graft group.

The Quintana Roo state branch of PVEM removed its leader, José de la Peña Ruiz de Chávez, for his relationship with the Romanian mafia on 10 February 2021. He kept his position as a member of the Congress of Quintana Roo. José Luis Jonathan Yong, former Public Security director in Cancun (2016–2018) has been implicated. De la Peña Ruiz de Chávez is said to also have ties to Leticia Rodríguez Lara &quot;Doña Lety&quot;, leader of the Cancun drug cartel.

===Unlawful political advertising in movie theaters===
In January 2015, the National Electoral Institute (INE) ordered the PVEM and theater chains Cinemex and Cinépolis to cease airing PVEM advertisements on the grounds of fairness in electoral contests. When the PVEM and the theaters did not comply, the INE imposed a fine of MXN$35 million on the PVEM and MXN$7 million on both theater chains. The fine on the PVEM was later increased to MXN$67.1 million.

===Post-campaign influencer posts===
In 2015, various media personalities alleged that they had been offered more than MXN$200,000 if they disseminated messages in favor of the PVEM through social networks in the middle of election day, despite a ban on campaigning on that day.

In 2021, a similar incident occurred, and several influencers were fined for illegal posts in favor of PVEM on social media after the period of campaigning had ended. Fer Moreno admitted she had been paid MXN$10,000 (US$) and apologized.

<doc id="441425" wikidata="Q883305" url="?curid=441425" title="Bleak House">
<text>Bleak House is a novel by English author Charles Dickens, first published as a 20-episode serial between 12 March 1852 and 12 September 1853. The novel has many characters and several subplots, and is told partly by the novel&#x27;s heroine, Esther Summerson, and partly by an omniscient narrator. At the centre of &quot;Bleak House&quot; is a long-running legal case in the Court of Chancery, &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;, which comes about because a testator has written several conflicting wills. In a preface to the 1853 first edition, Dickens said there were many actual precedents for his fictional case. One such was probably &quot;Thellusson v Woodford&quot;, in which a will read in 1797 was contested and not determined until 1859. Though many in the legal profession criticised Dickens&#x27;s satire as exaggerated, &quot;Bleak House&quot; helped support a judicial reform movement that culminated in the enactment of legal reform in the 1870s.

Some scholars debate when &quot;Bleak House&quot; is set. The English legal historian Sir William Holdsworth sets the action in 1827; however, reference to preparation for the building of a railway in Chapter LV suggests the 1830s. A work of Gothic fiction depicting London as a murky city swathed in fog, &quot;Bleak House&quot; is credited with introducing urban fog to the novel, which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film. Released in 1901, the &quot;Bleak House&quot;-inspired &quot;The Death of Poor Joe&quot; is the earliest filmed adaptation of a Dickens work.

==Synopsis==

&quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; is an interminable probate case in the Court of Chancery concerning two or more wills and their beneficiaries. Lady Honoria Dedlock, the beneficiary of one of the wills, lives with her husband, Sir Leicester Dedlock, at his estate at Chesney Wold. While listening to the reading by Mr Tulkinghorn, the family solicitor, of an affidavit, Lady Dedlock recognises the handwriting on the copy. The sight affects her so much she almost faints, which Mr Tulkinghorn notices and investigates. He traces the copyist, a pauper known only as &quot;Nemo&quot;, in London. Nemo has recently died, and the only person to identify him is a street-sweeper, a poor homeless boy named Jo, who lives in a particularly grim and poverty-stricken part of the city known as Tom-All-Alone&#x27;s.
Esther Summerson is raised by the harsh Miss Barbary, who tells her, &quot;Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.&quot; After Miss Barbary dies, John Jarndyce becomes Esther&#x27;s guardian and assigns &quot;Conversation&quot; Kenge, a Chancery lawyer, to take charge of her future. After attending school for six years, Esther moves in with Jarndyce at his home, Bleak House. Jarndyce simultaneously assumes custody of two other wards, his cousins Richard Carstone and Ada Clare. They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue in &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;; their guardian is a beneficiary under another will, and the two wills conflict. 

Richard and Ada soon fall in love, but though Jarndyce does not oppose the match, he stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession. Richard first tries a career in medicine, and Esther meets Allan Woodcourt, a physician, at the house of Richard&#x27;s tutor. When Richard mentions the prospect of gaining from the resolution of &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;, Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls &quot;the family curse.&quot; Richard decides to change his career to law, then later switches again and spends the remainder of his funds to buy a commission as a military officer.

Lady Dedlockdisguised as her maid, Mademoiselle Hortensepays Jo to take her to Nemo&#x27;s grave. Meanwhile, Mr Tulkinghorn is concerned Lady Dedlock has a secret which could threaten the interests of Sir Leicester and watches her constantly, even enlisting the real Hortense to spy on her. He also enlists Inspector Bucket to run Jo out of town, to eliminate anything that might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks. Esther sees Lady Dedlock at church and later talks with her at Chesney Wold. 

Lady Dedlock discovers that Esther is her own child: unknown to Sir Leicester, before she married, Honoria had had a lover, Captain Hawdon (Nemo), and bore a daughter by him, who she had believed was dead. The daughter, Esther, was brought up by Honoria&#x27;s sister, Miss Barbary. Esther becomes sick (possibly with smallpox, since it severely disfigures her) from Jo. Lady Dedlock waits until she has recovered before telling her the truth. Though the two women are happy to be reunited, Lady Dedlock tells Esther they must never acknowledge their connection again. 

Upon recovery, Esther finds that Richard, having failed at several professions, has ignored Jarndyce&#x27;s advice and is trying to push &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; to conclusion in his and Ada&#x27;s favour, and as a result has fallen out with Jarndyce. In the process, Richard loses all his money and declines in health. He and Ada have secretly married, and Ada is pregnant. Esther has her own romance when Mr Woodcourt returns to England, having survived a shipwreck, and he continues to seek her company despite her disfigurement. However, Esther has already agreed to marry her guardian, the much older Jarndyce.

Hortense and Mr Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady Dedlock&#x27;s past. After a confrontation with Mr Tulkinghorn, Lady Dedlock flees her home, leaving a note apologising to Sir Leicester for her conduct. Mr Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense, who is no longer of any use to him. He is shot through the heart, and suspicion falls on Lady Dedlock. Sir Leicester, discovering his lawyer&#x27;s death and his wife&#x27;s confession and flight, suffers a catastrophic stroke, but he manages to communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to return.
Inspector Bucket, who has previously investigated several matters related to &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;, accepts Sir Leicester&#x27;s commission to find Lady Dedlock. He initially suspects her of the murder but is able to clear her of suspicion after discovering Hortense&#x27;s guilt. He requests Esther&#x27;s help to find her mother. Lady Dedlock has no way to know of her husband&#x27;s forgiveness or that she has been cleared of suspicion, and she wanders the country in cold weather before dying at the cemetery of her former lover, Captain Hawdon. Esther and Inspector Bucket find her there.

Progress in &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; seems to take a turn for the better when a later will is found, which revokes all previous wills and leaves the bulk of the estate to Richard and Ada. Jarndyce cancels his engagement to Esther, who becomes engaged to Mr Woodcourt. They go to Chancery to find Richard. On their arrival, they learn that the case of &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; is finally over, because the costs of litigation have entirely consumed the estate. Richard collapses, and blood in his mouth makes it evident he is in the last stages of tuberculosis. He apologises to Jarndyce and dies. Jarndyce takes in Ada and her child, a boy whom she names Richard. Esther and Mr Woodcourt marry and live in a Yorkshire house which Jarndyce gives to them. The couple later raise two daughters.

Many of the novel&#x27;s subplots focus on minor characters. One such subplot is the hard life and happy, though difficult, marriage of Caddy Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop. Another plot focuses on George Rouncewell&#x27;s rediscovery of his family, and his reunion with his mother and brother.

==Characters==
Although not a character, &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; is a vital part of the novel. It is believed to have been inspired by a number of real-life Chancery cases involving wills, including those of Charles Day and William Jennens, and of Charlotte Smith&#x27;s father-in-law, Richard Smith.

===Major characters===
* Esther Summerson is the heroine. She is Dickens&#x27;s only female narrator. Esther is raised as an orphan by her godmother Miss Barbary, who is in fact her aunt. She does not know her parents&#x27; identity. Miss Barbary holds macabre vigils on Esther&#x27;s birthday each year, telling her that her birth is no cause for celebration, because the girl is her mother&#x27;s &quot;disgrace&quot;. Because of her cruel upbringing she is self-effacing, self-deprecating and grateful for every trifle. The discovery of her true identity provides much of the drama in the book. Finally it is revealed that she is the illegitimate daughter of Lady Dedlock and Nemo, later learned to be Captain Hawdon.
* Honoria, Lady Dedlock is the haughty and beautiful mistress of Chesney Wold. The revelation of her past drives much of the plot. Before her marriage, Lady Dedlock had an affair with another man and bore his child. Her sister had told her at the time of the birth that the infant was stillborn. Years later, however, Lady Dedlock discovers that the child was born alive and is Esther Summerson. Because Lady Dedlock&#x27;s reaction to the affidavit suggests that she harbours a secret predating her marriage, she has attracted the curiosity of Mr Tulkinghorn who feels bound by his ties to his client, Sir Leicester, to pry out this secret. At the end of the novel, Lady Dedlock dies, disgraced in her own mind and convinced that her husband could never forgive what she imagines to be her own moral failings.
* John Jarndyce is an unwilling party in &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;, guardian of Richard, Ada, and Esther, and owner of Bleak House. Vladimir Nabokov called him &quot;one of the best and kindest human beings ever described in a novel&quot;. A wealthy man, he helps most of the other characters, motivated by a combination of goodness and guilt at the mischief and human misery caused by &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;, which he calls &quot;the family curse&quot;. At first, it seems possible that he is Esther&#x27;s father, but he makes clear he is her guardian shortly after she comes to live under his roof, explaining the letter he received asking him to take on that role a few years earlier. He falls in love with Esther and wishes to marry her, but he gives her up because she is in love with Mr Woodcourt.
* Richard Carstone is a ward of Chancery in &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;. Straightforward and likeable but irresponsible and inconstant, Richard falls under the spell of &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;. At the end of the book, just after &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; ends, he dies, worn out by his imprudence in trusting to the outcome of a Chancery suit.
* Ada Clare is another young ward of Chancery in &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;. She falls in love with Richard Carstone, a distant cousin. They later marry in secret, and she has Richard&#x27;s child. She is the dear friend of Esther&#x27;s.
* Harold Skimpole is a friend of Jarndyce&#x27;s &quot;in the habit of sponging his friends&quot; (Nuttall). He is irresponsible, selfish, amoral, and without remorse. He often refers to himself as &quot;a child&quot; and claims not to understand human relationships, circumstances, and society but actually understands them very well, as he demonstrates when he enlists Richard and Esther to pay off the bailiff who has arrested him on a writ of debt. He believes that Richard and Ada will be able to acquire credit based on their expectations in &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; and declares his intention to start &quot;honouring&quot; them by letting them pay some of his debts. This character is commonly regarded as a portrait of Leigh Hunt. Dickens wrote in a letter of 25 September 1853, &#x27;I suppose he is the most exact portrait that was ever painted in words! ... It is an absolute reproduction of a real man&#x27;. A contemporary critic commented, &#x27;I recognised Skimpole instantaneously; ... and so did every person whom I talked with about it who had ever had Leigh Hunt&#x27;s acquaintance.&#x27;&quot; G. K. Chesterton suggested that Dickens &quot;may never once have had the unfriendly thought, &#x27;Suppose Hunt behaved like a rascal!&#x27;; he may have only had the fanciful thought, &#x27;Suppose a rascal behaved like Hunt!&#x27;&quot;
* Lawrence Boythorn is an old friend of John Jarndyce&#x27;s and a former soldier who speaks in superlatives, very loud and harsh but goodhearted. Boythorn was once engaged to and very much in love with a woman who left him without giving him any reason. She was Miss Barbary, who abandoned her former life and Boythorn when she took Esther from her sister. Boythorn is also a neighbour of Sir Leicester Dedlock&#x27;s, with whom he is engaged in an epic tangle of lawsuits over a right-of-way across Boythorn&#x27;s property that Sir Leicester asserts the legal right to close. He is thought to be based on the writer Walter Savage Landor.
* Sir Leicester Dedlock is a crusty baronet, much older than his wife. Dedlock is an unthinking conservative who regards the &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; lawsuit as a mark of distinction worthy of a man of his family lineage. On the other hand, he is shown as a loving and devoted husband towards Lady Dedlock, even after he learns about her secret.
* Mr Tulkinghorn is Sir Leicester&#x27;s lawyer. He defers to his clients but enjoys and is driven by the power his control of their secrets gives him. He learns of Lady Dedlock&#x27;s past and tries to control her conduct, in the name of preserving the reputation and good name of Sir Leicester. He is murdered, and his murder gives Dickens the chance to weave a detective plot into the closing chapters of the book.
* Mr Snagsby is the timid and hen-pecked proprietor of a law-stationery business who gave law-writer work to Nemo. Snagsby gets involved with Mr Tulkinghorn and Inspector Bucket&#x27;s secrets. He is Jo&#x27;s only friend and tends to give half-crowns to those for whom he feels sorry.
* Miss Flite is an elderly eccentric. Her family has been destroyed by a long-running Chancery case similar to &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;, and her obsessive fascination with Chancery veers between comedy and tragedy. She owns a large number of little birds, which she says will be released &quot;on the day of judgment&quot;.
* Mr (William) Guppy is a law clerk at Kenge and Carboy. He becomes smitten with Esther and makes an offer of marriage, which she refuses. After Esther learns that Lady Dedlock is her mother, she asks Mr Guppy to stop investigating her past. He fears the meeting is to accept his offer of marriage, which he does not want to pursue now that she is disfigured by smallpox. He is relieved when she explains her true purpose and agrees to do everything in his power to protect her privacy in the future. After he gains full status as an attorney, ready to start his own practice (Chapter 59), he again proposes to Esther, who turns Guppy down without telling him she was engaged to Woodcourt.
* Inspector Bucket of the Detective (Branch) is a Metropolitan Police detective who undertakes several investigations throughout the novel, most notably the investigation of the murder of Mr Tulkinghorn. He is notable in being one of the first detectives in English fiction. This character is probably based on Inspector Charles Frederick Field of the then recently formed Detective Branch at Scotland Yard. Dickens wrote several journalistic pieces about the Inspector and the work of the detectives in &quot;Household Words&quot;. It has also been argued that the character was based on Jack Whicher, one of the &#x27;original&#x27; eight detectives set up by Scotland Yard in the middle 19th century.
* Mr George is a former soldier, who once served under Nemo and owns a London shooting-gallery where he trains men in sword and pistol. The first suspect in the murder of Mr Tulkinghorn, he is exonerated and his true identity is revealed, against his wishes, to his mother. He is George Rouncewell, son of the Dedlocks&#x27; housekeeper, Mrs Rouncewell, who welcomes him back to Chesney Wold. He ends the book as body-servant to the stricken Sir Leicester Dedlock.
* Caddy (Caroline) Jellyby is a friend of Esther&#x27;s, secretary to her mother. Caddy feels ashamed of her own &quot;lack of manners&quot;, but Esther&#x27;s friendship heartens her. Caddy falls in love with Prince Turveydrop, marries him, and has a baby.
* Krook is a rag and bottle merchant and collector of papers. He is the landlord of the house where Nemo and Miss Flite live and where Nemo dies. He seems to subsist on a diet of gin. Krook dies from a case of spontaneous combustion, something that Dickens believed could happen, but which some critics (such as the English essayist George Henry Lewes) denounced as outlandish. Amongst the stacks of papers obsessively hoarded by the illiterate Krook is the key to resolving the case of &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;.
* Jo is a young boy who lives on the streets and tries to make a living as a crossing sweeper. Jo was the only person with whom Nemo had any real connection. Nemo expressed a paternal sort of interest in Jo, something that no other human had ever done. Nemo would share his meagre money with Jo, and would sometimes remark, &quot;Well, Jo, today I am as poor as you,&quot; when he had nothing to share. Jo is called to testify at the inquiry into Nemo&#x27;s death but knows nothing of value. Despite this, Mr Tulkinghorn pays Inspector Bucket to harry Jo and force him to keep &quot;moving along&quot; [leave town] because Mr Tulkinghorn fears Jo might have some knowledge of the connection between Nemo and the Dedlocks. Jo ultimately dies from pneumonia, a complication from an earlier bout with smallpox, which Esther also catches and from which she almost dies.
* Allan Woodcourt is a surgeon and a kind, caring man who loves Esther deeply. She in turn loves him but feels unable to respond, not only because of her prior commitment to John Jarndyce but also because she fears her illegitimacy will cause his mother to object to their connection.
* Grandfather (Joshua) Smallweed is a moneylender, a mean, bad-tempered man who shows no mercy to people who owe him money and who enjoys inflicting emotional pain on others. He lays claim to the deceased Krook&#x27;s possessions because Smallweed&#x27;s wife is Krook&#x27;s sister and only living relation. Smallweed also drives Mr George into bankruptcy by abruptly calling in a loan. It has been suggested that his description (together with his grandchildren) fits that of a person with progeria, although people with progeria only have a life expectancy of 14 years, while Grandfather Smallweed is very old.
* Mr Vholes is a Chancery lawyer who takes on Richard Carstone as a client, squeezes out of him all the litigation fees he can manage to pay, and then abandons him when &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; comes to an end.
* &quot;Conversation&quot; Kenge is a Chancery lawyer who represents John Jarndyce, and has apprentice attorneys in his office, including Mr Guppy and more briefly, Richard Carstone. His chief foible is his love of grand, pretentious, and empty rhetoric.

===Minor characters===
* Mr Gridley is an involuntary party to a suit in Chancery (based on a real case, according to Dickens&#x27;s preface), who repeatedly seeks in vain to gain the attention of the Lord Chancellor. He threatens Mr Tulkinghorn and then is put under arrest by Inspector Bucket, but dies, his health broken by his Chancery ordeal. The character is based on the true case of Thomas Cook of Onecote, Leek, which was brought to Dickens&#x27;s attention in 1849 by his solicitor Mr W. Challinor of Leek.
* Nemo (Latin for &quot;nobody&quot;) is the alias of Captain James Hawdon, a former officer in the British Army under whom Mr George once served. Nemo is a law-writer who makes fair copies of legal documents for Snagsby and lodges at Krook&#x27;s rag and bottle shop, eventually dying of an opium overdose. He is later found to be Lady Dedlock&#x27;s former lover, and the father of Esther Summerson.
* Mrs Snagsby is Mr Snagsby&#x27;s highly suspicious and curious wife, who has a &quot;vinegary&quot; personality and incorrectly suspects Mr Snagsby of keeping many secrets from her: she suspects he is Jo&#x27;s father.
* Guster is the Snagsbys&#x27; maidservant, prone to fits.
* Neckett is a debt collector – called &quot;Coavinses&quot; by debtor Harold Skimpole because he works for that business firm.
* Charley is Neckett&#x27;s daughter, hired by John Jarndyce to be a maid to Esther. Called &quot;Little Coavinses&quot; by Skimpole.
* Tom is Neckett&#x27;s young son.
* Emma is Neckett&#x27;s baby daughter.
* Mrs Jellyby is Caddy&#x27;s mother, a &quot;telescopic philanthropist&quot; obsessed with an obscure African tribe but having little regard for the notion of charity beginning at home. It&#x27;s thought Dickens wrote this character as a criticism of female activists such as Caroline Chisholm.
* Mr Jellyby is Mrs Jellyby&#x27;s long-suffering husband.
* Peepy Jellyby is the Jellybys&#x27; young son.
* Prince Turveydrop is a dancing master and proprietor of a dance studio.
* Old Mr Turveydrop is a master of deportment who lives off his son&#x27;s industry.
* Jenny is a brickmaker&#x27;s wife. She is mistreated by her husband and her baby dies. She then helps her friend look after her own child.
* Rosa is a favourite lady&#x27;s maid of Lady Dedlock whom Watt Rouncewell wishes to marry. The proposal is initially refused when Mr Rouncewell&#x27;s father asks that Rosa be sent to school to become a lady worthy of his son&#x27;s station. Lady Dedlock questions the girl closely regarding her wish to leave, and promises to look after her instead. In some way, Rosa is a stand-in for Esther in Lady Dedlock&#x27;s life.
* Hortense is lady&#x27;s maid to Lady Dedlock. Her character is based on the Swiss maid and murderer Maria Manning.
* Mrs Rouncewell is housekeeper to the Dedlocks at Chesney Wold.
* Mr Robert Rouncewell, the adult son of Mrs Rouncewell, is a prosperous ironmaster.
* Watt Rouncewell is Robert Rouncewell&#x27;s son.
* Volumnia is a cousin of the Dedlocks, given to screaming.
* Miss Barbary is Esther&#x27;s godmother and severe childhood guardian, and sister of Lady Dedlock.
* Mrs Rachael Chadband is a former servant of Miss Barbary&#x27;s.
* Mr Chadband is an oleaginous preacher, husband of Mrs Chadband.
* Mrs Smallweed is the wife of Mr Smallweed senior and sister to Krook. She is suffering from dementia.
* Young Mr or Bart (Bartholomew) Smallweed is the grandson of the senior Smallweeds, twin of Judy Smallweed, and friend of Mr Guppy.
* Judy (Judith) Smallweed is the granddaughter of the senior Smallweeds, and twin of Bartholomew Smallweed.
* Tony Jobling, who adopts the alias Mr Weevle, is a friend of William Guppy.
* Mrs Guppy is Mr Guppy&#x27;s aged mother.
* Phil Squod is Mr George&#x27;s assistant.

* Mrs Bagnet is the wife of Matthew Bagnet.
* Woolwich is the Bagnets&#x27; son.
* Quebec is the Bagnets&#x27; elder daughter.
* Malta is the Bagnets&#x27; younger daughter.
* Mrs Woodcourt is Allan Woodcourt&#x27;s widowed mother.
* Mrs Pardiggle is a woman who does &quot;good works&quot; for the poor, but cannot see that her efforts are rude and arrogant, and do nothing at all to help. She inflicts her activities on her five small sons, who are clearly rebellious.
* Arethusa Skimpole is Mr Skimpole&#x27;s &quot;Beauty&quot; daughter.
* Laura Skimpole is Mr Skimpole&#x27;s &quot;Sentiment&quot; daughter.
* Kitty Skimpole is Mr Skimpole&#x27;s &quot;Comedy&quot; daughter.
* Mrs Skimpole is Mr Skimpole&#x27;s ailing wife, who is weary of her husband and his way of life.
* Debilitated Cousin of Sir Leicester Dedlock, who lies on couches emitting nearly incoherent, dubious observations. Famous line, concerning the murder: &quot;far better hang wrong fler [fellow] than no fler.&quot;

==Analysis and criticism==
===Narrative structure===
Much criticism of &quot;Bleak House&quot; focuses on its unique narrative structure: it is told both by a third-person omniscient narrator and a first-person narrator (Esther Summerson). The omniscient narrator speaks in the present tense and is a dispassionate observer. Esther Summerson tells her own story in the past tense (like David in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; or Pip in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;), and her narrative voice is characterised by modesty, consciousness of her own limits, and willingness to disclose to us her own thoughts and feelings. These two narrative strands never quite intersect, though they do run in parallel. Nabokov felt that letting Esther tell part of the story was Dickens&#x27;s &quot;main mistake&quot; in planning the novel. Alex Zwerdling, a scholar from Berkeley, after observing that &quot;critics have not been kind to Esther&quot;, nevertheless thought Dickens&#x27;s use of Esther&#x27;s narrative &quot;one of the triumphs of his art&quot;.

===Feminine modesty===
Esther&#x27;s portion of the narrative is perceived by some scholars as an interesting case study of the Victorian ideal of feminine modesty. She introduces herself thus: &quot;I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages, for I know I am not clever&quot; (chap. 3). This claim is almost immediately belied by the astute moral judgement and satiric observation that characterise her pages. In the same introductory chapter, she writes: &quot;It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about myself! As if this narrative were the narrative of life! But my little body will soon fall into the background now&quot; (chap. 3). This does not turn out to be true.

===Satire===
For most readers and scholars, the central concern of &quot;Bleak House&quot; is its indictment of the English Chancery court system. Chancery or equity courts were one half of the English civil justice system, existing side-by-side with law courts. Chancery courts heard actions having to do with wills and estates, or with the uses of private property. By the mid-nineteenth century, English law reformers had long criticised the delays of Chancery litigation, and Dickens found the subject a tempting target. He already had taken a shot at law-courts and that side of the legal profession in his 1837 novel &quot;The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club&quot; or &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. Scholars, such as the English legal historian Sir William Searle Holdsworth, in his 1928 series of lectures, have made a plausible case for treating Dickens&#x27;s novels, and &quot;Bleak House&quot; in particular, as primary sources illuminating the history of English law.

===Spontaneous combustion===
Dickens said in the preface to the book edition of &quot;Bleak House&quot; that he had &quot;purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things&quot;. And some remarkable things do happen: One character, Krook, smells of brimstone and eventually dies of spontaneous human combustion. This was highly controversial. The nineteenth century saw the increasing triumph of the scientific worldview. Scientifically inclined writers, as well as physicians and scientists, rejected spontaneous human combustion as legend or superstition. When the instalment of &quot;Bleak House&quot; containing Krook&#x27;s demise appeared, the literary critic George Henry Lewes accused Dickens of &quot;giving currency to a vulgar error&quot;. Dickens vigorously defended the reality of spontaneous human combustion and cited many documented cases, as well as his own memories of coroners&#x27; inquests that he had attended when he had been a reporter. In the preface of the book edition of &quot;Bleak House&quot;, Dickens wrote: &quot;I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable Spontaneous Combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received.&quot;

===Critical reputation===
George Gissing and G. K. Chesterton are among those literary critics and writers who consider &quot;Bleak House&quot; to be the best novel that Dickens wrote. As Chesterton put it: &quot;&quot;Bleak House&quot; is not certainly Dickens&#x27;s best book; but perhaps it is his best novel&quot;. Harold Bloom, in his book &quot;The Western Canon&quot;, considers &quot;Bleak House&quot; to be Dickens&#x27;s greatest novel. Daniel Burt, in his book &quot;The Novel 100: A Ranking of the Greatest Novels of All Time&quot;, ranks &quot;Bleak House&quot; number 12. Horror and supernatural fiction author Stephen King named it among his top 10 favourite books.

==Locations of Bleak House==
The house named Bleak House in Broadstairs is not the original. Dickens stayed with his family at this house (then called Fort House) for at least one month every summer from 1839 until 1851. However, there is no evidence that it formed the basis of the fictional Bleak House, particularly as it is so far from the location of the fictional house.

The house is on top of the cliff on Fort Road and was renamed Bleak House after his death, in his honour. It is the only four storey grade II listed mansion in Broadstairs.

Dickens locates the fictional Bleak House in St Albans, Hertfordshire, where he wrote some of the book. An 18th-century house in Folly Lane, St Albans, has been identified as a possible inspiration for the titular house in the story since the time of the book&#x27;s publication and was known as Bleak House for many years.

==Adaptations==
In the late nineteenth century, actress Fanny Janauschek acted in a stage version of &quot;Bleak House&quot; in which she played both Lady Dedlock and her maid Hortense. The two characters never appear on stage at the same time. In 1876 John Pringle Burnett&#x27;s play, &quot;Jo&quot; found success in London with his wife, Jennie Lee playing Jo, the crossing-sweeper. In 1893, Jane Coombs acted in a version of &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

A 1901 short film, &quot;The Death of Poor Joe&quot;, is the oldest known surviving film featuring a Charles Dickens character (Jo in &quot;Bleak House&quot;).

In the silent film era, &quot;Bleak House&quot; was filmed in 1920 and 1922. The latter version featured Sybil Thorndike as Lady Dedlock.

In 1928, a short film made in the UK in the Phonofilm sound-on-film process starred Bransby Williams as Grandfather Smallweed.

In 1998, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of five hour-long episodes, starring Michael Kitchen as John Jarndyce.

The BBC has produced three television adaptations of &quot;Bleak House&quot;. The first serial, &quot;Bleak House&quot;, was broadcast in 1959 in eleven half-hour episodes. The serial survives. The second &quot;Bleak House&quot;, starring Diana Rigg and Denholm Elliott, aired in 1985 as an eight-part series. In 2005, the third &quot;Bleak House&quot; was broadcast in fifteen episodes starring Anna Maxwell Martin, Gillian Anderson, Denis Lawson, Charles Dance, and Carey Mulligan. It won a Peabody Award that same year because it &quot;created &#x27;appointment viewing,&#x27; soap-style, for a series that greatly rewarded its many extra viewers.&quot;

==Musical references==
Charles Jefferys wrote the words for and Charles William Glover wrote the music for songs called &quot;Ada Clare&quot; and &quot;Farewell to the Old House&quot;, which are inspired by the novel.

Anthony Phillips included a piece entitled &quot;Bleak House&quot; on his 1979 progressive rock release, &quot;Sides&quot;. The form of the lyrics roughly follows the narrative of Esther Summerson, and is written in her voice.

==Original publication==
Like most Dickens novels, &quot;Bleak House&quot; was published in 20 monthly instalments, each containing 32 pages of text and two illustrations by Phiz (the last two being published together as a double issue). Each cost one shilling, except for the final double issue, which cost two shillings.

<text>The Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. is a denomination of Christianity aligned with the holiness movement. The body is headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi. In 2010, there were 14,000 members in 154 churches. The denomination traces its history to its founder Charles Price Jones, a minister who had embraced Holiness Methodist doctrine.

== History ==

The Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. shares a common early history with the Church of God in Christ. Charles Price Jones, a Missionary Baptist preacher in Alabama and later Mississippi, accepted the doctrines of Holiness Methodism around 1896. During this time C.P. Jones became associated with W. S. Pleasant, J. A. Jeter, Charles Harrison Mason, along with other Holiness leaders. In 1897, C.P. Jones conducted a Holiness convention from June 6–15 at the church he pastored, Mt. Helm Baptist Church, in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1898, the name Mt. Helm Baptist Church was changed to Church of Christ. This new group of Holiness leaders was expelled from the Jackson Baptist Association. From that expulsion, they adopted the name Christ Association of Mississippi of Baptized Believers in Christ in 1900, and the national Holiness movement accepted the name by C. H. Mason—&quot;Church of God in Christ&quot;—in 1906. In that same year, an annual convocation selected J. A. Jeter, C. H. Mason, and D. J. Young to investigate the Azusa Street Revival conducted by William J. Seymour. C.H. Mason and D. J. Young accepted William Seymour&#x27;s teaching concerning the baptism of the Holy Spirit and returned with such doctrinal message with great enthusiasm. After an extended discussion on the issue of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, at the 1907 convention, the assembly withdrew the right hand of fellowship from C. H. Mason, D. J. Young and others who held to the doctrine of speaking in tongues. C. P. Jones retained the doctrine of the holiness movement, while C. H. Mason held to Holiness Pentecostalism. Congregations led by Charles W. Gray also retained the original teaching of the holiness movement and though identical in doctrine to those led by C.P. Jones, they left and formed the Original Church of God.

The name &quot;Church of God in Christ&quot; was widely held by both groups until 1907, when Bishop C. H. Mason had the name COGIC, incorporated. Churches of the Holiness division began to use the name &quot;Church of Christ Holiness&quot;, and in October 1920 was chartered in the state of Mississippi as the Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A..

== Theology ==

The &quot;Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.&quot; is trinitarian with a Holiness emphasis. Water baptism of believers by immersion and the Lord&#x27;s supper as a memorial are held to be ordinances of the church. Foot washing is also practiced, but it is not regarded as an ordinance. The church does not reject speaking in tongues (glossolalia). The church emphasizes that the Holy Spirit is an indispensable gift to every believer, but places no emphasis on an &quot;initial evidence&quot; as speaking in tongues to be the results of such gift.

== Leadership ==

The church is episcopal in structure with a Senior Bishop as the highest official and spiritual leader. The church in the United States is divided into eight dioceses - Eastern, North Central, Northern, Pacific North West, South Central, South Eastern, South Western, and Western. In 2008 the &quot;Church of Christ (Holiness)&quot; had 15,000 members in 167 congregations in the United States, the Dominican Republic and Africa.

<doc id="441442" wikidata="Q3867253" url="?curid=441442" title="USS Darter (SS-576)">
<text>USS &quot;Darter&quot; (SS-576), a unique submarine based on the , but incorporating many improvements, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the darter, a type of small American fresh-water fish.

The contract to build &quot;Darter&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 30 June 1954 and her keel was laid down on 10 November 1954. She was launched on 28 May 1956 sponsored by Mrs. G.L. Russell, and commissioned on 20 October 1956.

Designed under project SCB 116 with sophisticated acoustic, electronic and fire control gear, &quot;Darter&quot; was intended to serve as a new generation of post-war ASW submarines, similar to . &quot;Darter&quot; was used to experiment with numerous innovations including a three-man helmsman-planesman station using aircraft-style stick controls.

==Service history==

Upon commissioning &quot;Darter&quot; operated on various training exercises in the Atlantic, both locally from her homeport of Newport, Rhode Island, and on cruises to the West Indies, to Canada and Europe on NATO operations. Following an overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard she changed homeport to Charleston, South Carolina on 1 August 1959 and began training missions in support of the newly commissioned fleet ballistic missile submarines, providing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) services for surface units in the West Indies and off Key West, Florida, and serving as a platform for various Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) projects. In between these operations, &quot;Darter&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean for cruises in 1963 and 1967. She also received a major modernization overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard in 1965, receiving a hull extension (the &quot;plug&quot;, just forward of the engine room), new engines, new safety gear (SUBSAFE), better electronic gear (including the AN/BQG-4 Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System (PUFFS) passive sonar with three shark-fin domes added topside) and other upgrades.

Shifting homeports again in 1971, she moved to San Diego, California, &quot;Darter&quot; made four Western Pacific (WestPac) deployments in support of 7th Fleet operations. While on one of these in 1978, the head valve failed to close while snorkeling, and the ship had to emergency surface among U.S. surface units participating in an ASW exercise. On 8 May 1979, &quot;Darter&quot; changed homeport again to Sasebo, Japan, where she operated as a forward-deployed submarine. She spent a decade there: conducting numerous joint operations with the Japanese, South Korean, Thai, Malaysian, British and Australian navies; special operations; and other operations and exercises throughout the Western Pacific. Darter served as a submarine platform for U.S. Navy SEALS, USMC Recon Marines and the U.S. Army Special Forces. She won a Battle Efficiency Award (Battle &quot;E&quot;) in 1980 and again in 1982.

In mid-1982 she underwent an overhaul at the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. In September 1985, &quot;Darter&quot; was submerged when the submarine collided with the merchant ship (tanker) &quot;Kansas Getty&quot; and its anchor chain near Pusan, Korea. &quot;Darter&quot; suffered some damage and was repaired at Sasebo, Japan. Nobody was injured in the accident and the tanker was undamaged.

&quot;Darter&quot; was decommissioned in Pearl Harbor on 1 December 1989 after serving over 33 years in the US Navy. Her career was one of the longest for a US Navy submarine, during which Darter earned seven Battle “E” Awards and numerous departmental excellence awards.

She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 January 1990. On 7 January 1992, ex-&quot;Darter&quot; was sunk as a target by off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

<doc id="441445" wikidata="Q5018882" url="?curid=441445" title="Calculation (card game)">
<text>Calculation (also known as Broken Intervals, Hopscotch and Four Kings Solitaire) is a solitaire card game played with a standard pack of 52 cards. It is part of the Sir Tommy family of patience games. It has its origin in France, where it is known as La Plus Belle.

It offers more scope for skill than many similar games; a skilled player can win Calculation more than 80% of the time when &quot;normal play&quot; can allow winning 1 in 5 times. Good strategy typically sees players use 6s, 8s, and Queens early and 10s, Jacks, and Kings later; clever placement of cards in the waste is also critical, with some players reserving one waste pile for the Kings. Every game of Calculation Solitaire is winnable. The key is to focus on putting cards in the &#x27;waste piles&#x27; in reverse order.

==Rules==
At the start of play, an ace, two, three, and four of any suit are removed from a standard deck of cards and laid out as the foundations. The ace foundation is to be built up in sequence until the king is reached, regardless of suit. The other foundations are similarly built up, but by twos, threes, and fours, respectively, until they each reach a king, as in the following table:

The tableau, initially empty, consists of four piles of cards, usually arranged immediately below the four foundations.

Play in Calculation is simple. A single card is turned up from the stock and played either to the top of any of the four tableau piles, or onto one of the foundations if desired. The top card of any tableau pile may also be played onto one of the foundation piles if it is the next number in the appropriate sequence for that foundation. The game is won when all cards have been played onto the foundations, and lost when no further play is possible.

==Variants==
As a variation, cards may be played from the stock to a waste pile which holds one card, and played from there to a foundation or tableau, instead of being played from the stock to a foundation or tableau as soon as they are turned over. 

Variations which make Calculation more difficult are to play all 52 cards without the starting A,2,3,4 on the foundations, or to use only three instead of four tableau piles. Playing with both these variations makes the game quite difficult, but a very skilled player will still be able to win at least two games out of three.

Devil&#x27;s Grip is a broadly related game with similar game-play to Calculation, using two-decks stripped of the Aces, and playing cards to a 3x8 grid where cards increase by three in rank.

Musical is a related game in which cards are played from the stock to a single pile, but in which the stock contains 44 cards rather than 48, and in which the stock can be dealt three times.

One234 is a Calculation style game with completely open information but a low probability of success; it begins with a tableau of 8 columns with 6 cards each laid out face-up at the start of the game. Closely related to One234 is its easier variant Appreciate.

<doc id="441452" wikidata="Q39306" url="?curid=441452" title="Saarloos wolfdog">
<text>The Saarloos Wolfdog (, ) is a wolfdog breed originating from the Netherlands by the crossing of a German Shepherd with a Siberian grey wolf in 1935. The offspring were then further crossed with German Shepherds.

== History ==
Leendert Saarloos (1884–1969) was a Dutch zoologist and dog breeder who believed that the German Shepherd had become too domesticated and wanted to breed back the more natural properties in order to derive a better working dog. In 1935, he bred a male German Shepherd (, ) to a female Eurasian grey wolf (&quot;Canis lupus lupus&quot;) from Siberia. He then bred the offspring back with German Shepherds to derive a dog with one quarter wolf blood. The result was a dog that was not useful as a working dog but as companion that is close to nature. The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975 as &quot;Saarlooswolfdog&quot;, after its creator. In 1981, the breed was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI).

=== Genetic evidence ===
In 2015, a DNA study found that the Saarlooswolfdog showed more genetic association with the grey wolf than any other breed, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with grey wolves in this breed. In 2016, a major DNA study of domestic dogs found a deep division between the Saarlooswolfdog and all other dogs, highlighting its descent from the crossing of German Shepherds with captive wolves in the 1930s. In 2019, a genomic study found that the amount of grey wolf ancestry possessed by the Saarlooswolfdog is 18–33% and the Czechoslovakian wolfdog 20–30%.

== Description ==
The Saarloos Wolfdog is a strongly built dog whose build, coat and movement is wolf-like. The height is between in males and in females. It weighs up to . It is an athletic dog in build, with medium bone, and a strong and muscular body. It moves lightly on its feet and has an elegant march. Its coat is short and dense, providing good protection from the weather. There are three colours: wolfgrey, forestbrown and white. Because the wolfgrey genes are dominant, this is the most common colour. Genes for white colour are recessive, making this uncommon although this colour is accepted. The Saarloos has wolf-like expressions, as well as a wolf-like head.

== Training ==
This breed needs thorough socialization before the twelfth week of age to ensure prosocial behavior.

== Outcross program ==
The two Dutch parent breed clubs for Saarloos wolfdogs researched possibilities to improve the breed&#x27;s health by increasing genetic diversity. The first meetings with the Dutch kennel club were held in 2010. Following these meetings, Wageningen University and Research was asked to investigate the degree of interrelatedness of the population. The research was conducted by quantitative geneticist J.J. Windig and Ir M. Spies-Stoop. This study revealed that the population of Saarloos wolfdogs was very closely related. Without intervention, the degree of inbreeding would threaten the breed&#x27;s survival. The scientists advised a controlled and extensive outcross program, to increase the breed&#x27;s vitality, fertility and genetic variation. The Dutch kennel club approved the outcross programme in 2012.

Two types of outcrosses are used in the outcross programme. The first type is the use of so-called &#x27;look-alikes&#x27;, which are dogs that resemble a Saarlooswolfdog, but that don&#x27;t have a pedigree or that belong to a breed that isn&#x27;t recognized by the FCI. The second type is the use of several FCI-recognized breeds. The breeds to be used are chosen by breed club members and agreed upon by majority vote. The procedure for both types of outcrosses is the same. The outcross is performed and the F1 generation is produced. The F1 is evaluated and fully health screened, and the best individuals are chosen to contribute to the next generation. This is done by breeding them back to purebred Saarloos wolfdogs, which produces the F2 generation. The F2 is again evaluated and health tested, and the best individuals are bred back to Saarloos wolfdogs to produce the F3 generation. The offspring of an F3 with a purebred Saarloos wolfdog (F4) will get an official pedigree and be recognized as a purebred. In order to maintain proper breed type, purebred breeding of Saarlooswolfdogs must continue alongside the outcross program.

As of January 2019, the following outcrosses have been performed: 
* White Swiss Shepherd (currently in the F3) 
* Siberian Husky (currently in the F2) 
* Ibizan Hound (currently in the F2) 
* Norwegian Elkhound (currently in the F3) 
* Look-alike Northern Inuit Dog (currently in the F3)

<doc id="441453" wikidata="Q264113" url="?curid=441453" title="Senate of the Republic (Mexico)">
<text>The Senate of the Republic (), constitutionally the Chamber of Senators of the Honorable Congress of the Union (), is the upper house of Mexico&#x27;s bicameral Congress. It currently consists of 128 members, who serve six-year terms.

== History ==
A bicameral legislature, including the Senate, was established on 4 October 1824. The Senate was abolished on 7 September 1857 and re-established on 13 November 1874. Under the regime of Porfirio Díaz (the Porfiriato: 1876–1910), many seats were given to elites and wealthy people loyal to the regime. During the Mexican Revolution, notably during the brief presidency of Francisco I. Madero, the Senate was left intact with Porfirian sympathizers, who blocked the president&#x27;s attempts to pass reforms for the Revolution.

==Composition==
After a series of reforms during the 1990s, the Senate consists of 128 senators:

*Two for each of the 32 states, elected under the principle of relative majority.
*One for each of the 32 states, assigned under the principle of first minority (i.e., awarded to the party or coalition with the second highest number of votes in the state).
*Thirty-two national senators-at-large, divided among the parties that received at least 3% of the vote in proportion to their share of the national vote.

In a senatorial race, each party or coalition nominates two candidates who run and are elected together by direct vote. The party or coalition of the two candidates that won the second highest vote within the state then assigns a senator to occupy the third seat (first minority seat), according to the list of candidates that the party or coalition registered with the Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE).

Senators serve six-year terms, running concurrently with the president of Mexico&#x27;s &quot;sexenio&quot;. Special elections are rare, as substitutes are chosen at every election. Until 2018, the Senate was completely renewed every six years since senators were barred from immediate reelection, but they can now serve a second term.
The current composition of the Senate is as follows:

==Term==
In Spanish, it is conventional to refer to each legislature by the Roman numeral of its term. The current session (from 2024 to 2027) is the LXVI Legislatura (&quot;66th Legislature&quot;).

Senators are elected to serve during two legislatures, while members of the Chamber of Deputies serve only one. Thus, current senators (elected in the general election of 2 June 2024) serve during the 66th and 67th Legislatures.

===Legislatures===
A senator holds office for six years for which they were elected (from 1 September of the year of the election to 31 August six years later), divided into two legislatures of three years each.

The LXVI Legislature was installed on 1 September 2024, and its term will end on 31 August 2027. Senators were elected to office in the 2024 election for six years and have been in office since 1 September of that year; therefore, they will hold office during both the LXVI Legislature and the LXVII Legislature.

==Election of senators==

===Eligibility requirements===

According to the Constitution, senators are the representatives of the nation. Election to the Senate, by any of the mechanisms available, requires the candidate to meet the following requirements:
*Be a Mexican citizen by birth, fully exercising their rights.
*Be twenty-five years old on election day.
*Be a native of the state where the election is held or a resident with an effective residence of more than six months before the election date.
*Not be on active duty in the military or have control of the police or rural gendarmerie at least ninety days before the election.
*Not be a secretary or undersecretary of state unless the office is definitively resigned at least ninety days before the election.
*Not be Minister of the Supreme Court unless the office is definitively resigned three years before the election.
*Not be a minister of religion.

===Election process===
Senators are elected for a six-year term, corresponding to two legislatures, and can be reelected only once for the immediate period.

They are elected in two ways: 96 in 32 three-seat constituencies based on the country&#x27;s states and 32 in a nationwide constituency by proportional representation. In the three-seat constituencies, two seats are allocated to the party receiving the most votes (mayoría relativa) and one seat to the party receiving the second-highest votes (primera minoría).

==Last election==

==Governing bodies==
Its internal government has two main instances, namely:
*Board: Composed of a chair, three vice-chairs, and four secretaries elected for each regular session of the Senate; the chair is the president of the Senate and is the head and representative of the Chamber.
*Political Coordination Board: The true governing body of the Chamber consists of a chair and six members, which always include the coordinators of the different parliamentary factions of political parties represented in the Senate.

==Commissions==
To deal with legislative affairs, senators form commissions dedicated to a particular issue. The most important committees are interior, constitutional issues, defense, finance, and justice. Each senator belongs to at least three different commissions, and each committee elects a chair and two to five secretaries (according to the commission) to coordinate their work.

==Sessions==
The two chambers of the Congress of the Union divide their work into two ordinary sessions, the first from 1 September to 15 December and the second from 1 February to 30 April; if necessary, special sessions may be convened to discuss urgent or pertinent matters.

The time between the regular sessions is known as recess. There are two recesses: 16 December to 31 January and 1 May to 31 August. During these breaks, the standing committee of the Congress of the Union is installed and serves as the legislature&#x27;s depository. It comprises 37 members — 19 deputies and 18 senators — appointed by their respective chambers the day before the closing of the regular sessions.

The standing committee&#x27;s sessions are held in the Senate during the first recess and in the Chamber of Deputies during the second recess.

==Functions==
Among the most important functions of the Senate is to ratify or reject the president&#x27;s proposals regarding:
*Ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation.
*The Attorney General of the Republic.
*Heads of autonomous bodies.
*Diplomatic representatives (ambassadors and consuls).
*Treaties.

<text>Legend tripping is a practice in which a usually furtive nocturnal pilgrimage is made to a site which is alleged to have been the scene of some tragic, horrific, and possibly supernatural event or haunting. The practice mostly involves the visiting of sites endemic to locations identified in local urban legends, and can serve as a rite of passage. Legend tripping has been documented most thoroughly to date in the United States.

== Sites for legend trips ==
While the stories that attach to the sites of legend tripping vary from place to place, and sometimes contain a kernel of historical truth, there are a number of motifs and recurring themes in the legends and the sites. Abandoned buildings, remote bridges, tunnels, caves, rural roads, specific woods or other uninhabited (or semi-uninhabited) areas, and especially cemeteries are frequent sites of legend-tripping pilgrimages.

== Reactions and controversies ==
Legend-tripping is a mostly harmless, perhaps even beneficial, youth recreation. It allows young people to demonstrate their courage in a place where the actual physical risk is likely slight. However, in what Ellis calls &quot;ostensive abuse,&quot; the rituals enacted at the legend-tripping sites sometimes involve trespassing, vandalism, and other misdemeanors, and sometimes acts of animal sacrifice or other blood ritual. These transgressions then sometimes lead to local moral panics that involve adults in the community, and sometimes even the mass media. These panics often further embellish the prestige of the legend trip to the adolescent mind. In at least one notorious case, years of destructive legend-tripping, amounting to an &quot;ostensive frenzy,&quot; led to the fatal shooting of a legend-tripper near Lincoln, Nebraska followed by the wounding of the woman whose house had become the focus of the ostension. The panic over youth Satanism in the 1980s was fueled in part by graffiti and other ritual activities engaged in by legend-tripping youths.

<text>Second Cup is a Canadian coffeehouse chain and retailer of specialty coffee headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario. Its stores sell hot and cold beverages, pastries, snacks, pre-packaged food items, sandwiches, and drinkware, including mugs and tumblers.

==History==
Second Cup was founded in 1975 by Tom Culligan and Frank O&#x27;Dea in Toronto, Ontario. Culligan eventually purchased O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s shares and expanded Second Cup into a 150-store chain. He sold it in 1988 to the founder of mmmuffins, Michael Bregman.

As chairman and CEO, Khalil Al Gawad took Second Cup public in 1993. Between 1993 and 2002, it was owned by several American companies, including Coffee Plantation, Coffee People, and Caribou Coffee. Al Gawad sold Second Cup to Cara Operations Limited in 2002.

In November 2006, Cara sold Second Cup to Dinecorp Hospitality, controlled by former Cara CEO Gabe Tsampalieros, who became chairman of Second Cup. Tsampalieros died on March 11, 2009.

The trademark rights were subsequently split between Canada (the Second Cup Ltd.) and international (the Second Cup Coffee Company Inc.). Stacey Mowbray was head of the Canadian company, and Jim Ragas led the international side. Second Cup was featured in an episode of &quot;Undercover Boss&quot; that aired in March 2012 on the W Network. Under Mowbray&#x27;s direction, Second Cup was presented as &quot;a company that cares&quot;.

In September 2012, the company launched Tassimo beverages. In April 2015, Second Cup started a rewards program, which allow users to earn points using a mobile app. Alix Box was the CEO and president at Second Cup Ltd. from 2014 until her sudden departure, in May 2017; she was temporarily replaced by Garry MacDonald.

On April 12, 2018, Bregman announced an agreement with National Access Cannabis to develop and convert a network of recreational cannabis stores. Second Cup agreed to transform some of its western Canada locations into recreational cannabis dispensaries, with no cannabis-related products to be sold at its cafés.
The company stated that this alliance would allow it to leverage its real estate assets to drive value for the franchisees without affecting plans for new product innovation and opening new cafés across Canada. In August 2018, the company was already considering which of its locations in Ontario might be suitable as cannabis retail stores as an alternative to their current use, in conjunction with National Access Cannabis.

On November 8, 2019, Second Cup announced plans to change its name to Aegis Brands Inc. (), pending stockholder approval the following year. The company was scheduled to open two cannabis stores in Calgary in early 2020 and planned expansion into Ontario. On December 5, 2019, Aegis Brands announced its acquisition of Ottawa-based coffeehouse chain Bridgehead Coffee for $11 million.

In February 2021, Aegis Brands agreed to sell Second Cup to Quebec-based Foodtastic Inc. for an undisclosed sale price that included $14 million in cash. Foodtastic chief executive Peter Mammas said that the company intended to expand the brand to 300 locations by 2025, from the existing store count of 190.

==Rainforest Alliance==
The Rainforest Alliance is an international nonprofit organization that works to conserve biodiversity and promote the fair treatment of workers. Rainforest Alliance Certified coffee farms must meet standards that include the protection of farms, soils, waterways, and wildlife; the workers are in safe working conditions; and the workers enjoy suitable housing, medical care, and access to schools for their children. 80% of Second Cup coffees are Rainforest Alliance Certified.

As of the end of 2011, Second Cup offered ten whole-leaf tea blends and herbal tisanes that were fair trade certified.

==Firebombing incident==
In 2001, Rhéal Mathieu, a member of Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), who in 1967 had been sentenced to nine years in prison for terrorist activities including murder, was convicted of firebombing three Second Cup locations in Montreal. The responsibility for the bombings was claimed by the Brigade d&#x27;autodéfense du français (BAF) (translated as Self Defence Brigade of French). BAF claimed it had targeted the stores because the company used its incorporated English name, &quot;Second Cup&quot;, demanding the inclusion of French in the name. After the media coverage of the fire bombings, many Second Cup locations in Quebec changed their signs to &quot;Les cafés Second Cup&quot;.

<text>The Imperial Valley ( or &quot;Valle Imperial&quot;) of Southern California lies in Imperial and Riverside counties, with an urban area centered on the city of El Centro. The Valley is bordered by the Colorado River to the east and, in part, the Salton Sea to the west. Farther west lies the San Diego and Imperial County border. To the north is the Coachella Valley region of Riverside County, which together with Imperial Valley form the Salton Trough, or the Cahuilla Basin, also the county line of Imperial and Riverside counties, and to the south the international boundary with Mexico.

The culture of the area blends those of the United States and Mexico, due to its regional history and geographic location along the international border. The Imperial Valley economy is based on agriculture.

Imperial Valley was named by the Imperial Land Company, in the hopes of attracting settlers. It is now the home of the El Centro metropolitan area. Locally, the terms &quot;Imperial Valley&quot; and &quot;Imperial County&quot; are used synonymously. Imperial Valley is also called Lithium Valley, because of its rich supply of lithium, used to power electric vehicles, cameras, etc.

==Geography==

The Imperial Valley extends southward for from the southern end of the Salton Sea into Mexico. Part of a trough stretching from the Coachella Valley to the Gulf of California, it is almost entirely below sea level— below at the edge of the Salton Sea. Its hot desert climate is characterized by daily temperature extremes. It was once part of the Gulf of California, from which it was cut off by the dam-like deposits of the Colorado River Delta Fan as it carved out the Grand Canyon. Bordered by sand dunes and barren mountains, it was uninhabited until 1901, when the Imperial Canal was opened and diverted Colorado River water into the valley through Mexico. Floodwaters in 1905–07 destroyed the irrigation channels and created the Salton Sea now filled by the New River and irrigation run-off. The rivers in the southern part of the Salton Sea river basin flow south to north.

The valley is bordered by the Colorado River to the east and, in part, the Salton Sea to the west. Farther west lies the border with San Diego County and to the south the international boundary between the US state of California and Baja California, Mexico. To the north is the boundary with Riverside County and the Coachella Valley, which with the Imperial Valley form the &quot;Cahuilla Basin&quot; or the &quot;Salton Trough&quot;.

El Centro is the largest industrial center of the Imperial Valley, being the center of shipping exports as well as being home to retail, transportation, wholesale, and agricultural industries. There are also two international border crossings nearby for commercial and noncommercial vehicles. The city&#x27;s population was 37,835 at the 2000 census and 42,598 at the 2010 census. The city is below sea level and the largest city in the United States below sea level. Fifty percent of the jobs in El Centro come from the service and retail sector.

===Climate===

The Imperial Valley often has summer temperatures well over , but from late October until mid-April the temperature is relatively mild and sometimes low. During winter months the Valley averages more than eight hours of sunshine a day, receiving the most sunlight of any place in the United States.

Historically, the lowest minimum temperature ever recorded in the Imperial Valley was on January 22, 1937. The highest maximum temperature ever recorded was on July 28, 1995. The lowest maximum temperature was , recorded on January 24, 1949, and the highest minimum temperature was on June 30, 1946. The highest monthly mean temperature was , recorded in August 1969 and the lowest mean temperature was in February 1939.

The 85-year average annual rainfall is with June being the driest month. The only recorded snowfall in the Valley occurred on December 12, 1932. Snow began falling at 8:45 p.m. and by 5 a.m. the next day had been recorded. In the southwest portion of Imperial Valley, of snow was reported that day. This was the only snowfall on record to cover the entire valley.

===Regions===
Imperial Valley can loosely categorize its cities and communities into three regions: the Salton Beach Towns, Desert Cities, and the El Centro area (urbanized Imperial). The Salton Sea Beach Towns have the smallest cities but were resorts in their heyday and have since shrunk in population and size due to the current state of the Salton Sea. The cities and communities of the desert region are outliers in that they are away from urbanized Imperial and tend to be smaller in population than the cities surrounding El Centro. Cities of the El Centro area tend to be larger than those of the desert and Salton regions. And the southeastern end of California is the state&#x27;s poorest region, with lower-income residents making up over half of the year-round population.

===Urban areas of the region===
The &quot;El Centro&quot;, CA MSA is a multicore metropolitan region containing several urban areas.

==Economy==
Imperial County&#x27;s economy consists predominantly of government, agriculture, and retail trade that represents approximately 70% of total county employment. Government services account for over one-third of total employment. Agriculture accounts for one-fourth of jobs with major crops of alfalfa, lettuce, sugar beets and carrots. Retail growth has been experienced due to increased population in the Imperial and Mexicali Valleys. In 2005, the Imperial Valley Mall opened, attracting shoppers from the Valley area, including residents and tourists across the border from Mexicali.

===Tourism===
Tourism is considered the secondary industry of the Imperial Valley. Many visitors come to the area to visit the Salton Sea (California&#x27;s largest inland lake, which serves as a dumpout point for the overflow and drainage from the IID canal system and ditch drainage) and the Algodones Dunes. The New River and the Alamo River flow from the border city of Mexicali northward to the Salton Sea.

Another popular destination is the Salton Sea mud pots and volcanoes. These mud pots and volcanoes are in an open field on the eastern side of the Salton Sea. The mud is just above ambient temperature and it is possible to walk right up to the vents. The location is host to a number of gray cones reaching heights of six feet (2 m) and depressions filled with bubbling mud. These features are the result of the geothermal activity in the area.

Off-roading on ATVs is another popular activity during the winter months. Heber Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area is south of El Centro and is primarily an off-roading destination. The valley sand dune recreation area draws hundreds of thousands of off-road enthusiasts. Bird-watching is a popular activity, with abundant natural habitat and rare species. The Imperial Valley has an array of golf courses. Golf courses are in Holtville, Brawley and El Centro.

===Sites of interest===

====Fort Yuma====
Fort Yuma is on the banks of the Colorado River in Winterhaven, California. First established after the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, it was originally in the bottoms near the Colorado River, less than below the mouth of the Gila River. It was to defend the newly settled community of Yuma, Arizona on the other side of the Colorado River and the nearby Mexican border. In March 1851 the post was moved to a small elevation on the Colorado&#x27;s west bank, opposite the present city of Yuma, Arizona, on the site of the former Mission Puerto de Purísima Concepción. This site had been occupied by Camp Calhoun, named for John C. Calhoun, established in 1849. Fort Yuma was established to protect the southern emigrant travel route to California and to attempt control of the warlike Yuma Indians in the surrounding area.

====Blue Angels====
NAF El Centro is the winter home of the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, The Blue Angels. NAF El Centro historically starts the Blue Angels&#x27; season with their first air show, traditionally held in March.

====Imperial Valley Expo &amp; Fairgrounds====
The Imperial Valley Expo &amp; Fairgrounds is home to the California Mid-Winter Fair and Fiesta, which is the local county fair. It is also home to the Imperial Valley Speedway, a race track.

====Algodones Sand Dunes====
The name Algodones Dunes refers to the entire geographic feature, while the administrative designation for that portion managed by the Bureau of Land Management is the &quot;Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;Glamis Dunes&quot;). The Algodones Sand Dunes are the largest mass of sand dunes in California. This dune system extends for more than along the eastern edge of the Imperial Valley agricultural region in a band averaging in width. A major east–west route of the Union Pacific railroad skirts the eastern edge. The dune system is divided into 3 areas. The northernmost area is known as Mammoth Wash. South of Mammoth Wash is the North Algodones Dunes Wilderness established by the 1994 California Desert Protection Act. This area is closed to motorized use and access is by hiking and horseback. The largest and most heavily used area begins at Highway 78 and continues south just past Interstate 8. The dune formations occurring in this area are popular in film-making and have been the site for movies such as &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

====Salton Buttes====
The Salton Buttes are volcanoes on the southern shores of the Salton Sea.

====Colorado River====

The Colorado River is a popular destination for water sports including fishing, boating, water-skiing, and jet-skiing. The Colorado River is a river in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, approximately long, draining a part of the arid regions on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains. The natural course of the river flows from north of Grand Lake, Colorado into the Gulf of California. For many months out of the year, however, no water actually flows from the United States to the gulf, due to human consumption. Imperial Valley users use 3.8km³ of the Colorado River annually

====Salvation Mountain====
Salvation Mountain (location ) is a colorful artificial mountain north of Calipatria, California, near Slab City. It is made from adobe, straw, and thousands of gallons of paint. It was created by Leonard Knight to convey the message that &quot;God Loves Everyone&quot;. Mr. Knight refused substantial donations of money and labor from supporters who wished to modify his message of universal love to favor or disfavor particular groups.

====Anza-Borrego Desert State Park====

Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, portions of which are in Imperial County, is the largest state park in California. of dirt roads, 12 wilderness areas and miles of hiking trails provide visitors with an opportunity to see the Colorado Desert. The park is named after Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza and the Spanish name borrego, or bighorn sheep. The park features washes, wildflowers, palm groves, cacti and sweeping vistas. Animals inhabiting the state park include greater roadrunners, golden eagles, kit foxes, southern mule deer and Peninsular bighorn sheep, as well as desert iguanas, chuckwallas, and sidewinders.

====Fossil Canyon and Painted Gorge====
Fossil Canyon and the surrounding area near Ocotillo in the Coyote Mountains are great places for rock hounding and fossil hunting. The fossils here are not dinosaurs, but ancient shells, coral, and oysters from the Miocene epoch when the area was underwater.

The Painted Gorge, on the eastern side of the Coyote Mountains, consists of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks.

====Imperial NWR====

The Imperial National Wildlife Refuge protects wildlife habitat along of the lower Colorado River in Arizona and California, including the last un-channeled section before the river enters Mexico. The river and its associated backwater lakes and wetlands are a green oasis, contrasting with the surrounding desert mountains. It is a refuge and breeding area for migratory birds and local desert wildlife.

====Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR====
The Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, north of the Mexican border at the southern end of the Salton Sea and situated along the Pacific Flyway, is the only refuge of its kind, just below sea level. Because of its southern latitude, elevation and location in the Colorado Desert, the refuge experiences some of the highest temperatures in the nation. Daily temperatures from May to October generally exceed with temperatures of recorded yearly.
====Mexicali====
The border city of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, has museums, a zoo, a sports convention center, and an international airport. Visitors cross by foot or car from Calexico, California in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs draw tourists. Many shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs within walking distance from the border. Also US residents get medical and dental services in Mexicali because they tend to be less expensive than those in the United States. Mexico&#x27;s drinking age of 18 makes it a weekend destination for high school and college-aged Southern Californians.

===Agriculture===
Although this region is in the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert, with high temperatures and low average rainfall of per year, the economy is heavily based on agriculture due to irrigation, which is supplied wholly from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal. Farmers in Imperial Valley hold some of its oldest water rights and receive the largest share of water as of 2024, and their actions have been described as having a large effect on the Lake Mead reservoir.

Thousands of acres of prime farmland have transformed the desert into one of the most productive farming regions in California with an annual crop production of over $1 billion. Agriculture is the largest industry in the Imperial Valley and accounts for 48% of all employment. An environmental cost is that, south of the canal, the Colorado River no longer flows above ground at all for much of the year into Mexico.

A vast system of canals, check dams, and pipelines carry the water all over the valley, a system which forms the Imperial Irrigation District, or IID. The water distribution system includes over of canal and with of pipeline. The number of canal and pipeline branches number roughly over a hundred. Imported water and a long growing season allow two crop cycles each year, and the Imperial Valley is a major source of winter fruits and vegetables, cotton, and grain for U.S. and international markets. Alfalfa is another major crop produced in the Imperial Valley. The agricultural lands are served by a constructed agricultural drain system, which conveys surface runoff and subsurface drainage from fields to the Salton Sea, which is a designated repository for agricultural runoff, with environmental considerations not yet solved.

===Renewable energy===

Imperial Valley has become a &quot;hot-bed&quot; of renewable energy projects, both solar and geothermal. This is driven in part by California&#x27;s mandate to generate 33% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020, the valley&#x27;s excellent sun resources, the high unemployment, its proximity to large population centers on the coast, and large tracts of undeveloped desert land.

Much of the land suitable for green energy is owned by the federal government (Bureau of Land Management). , the BLM has received 163 applications to build renewable energy projects on in California, &quot;almost all of them are planned for the Imperial Valley and the desert region north of the valley.&quot; 

In addition, in 2012 Synthetic Genomics bought an site in the Imperial Valley to produce algae fuel with their engineered algae strains, as well as other algae products such as food.

==In popular culture==
Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s science fiction short story &quot;Water Is for Washing&quot; (&quot;Argosy&quot;, November 1947) was based on the premise that an earthquake had catastrophically shattered the range of deposits separating the Imperial Valley from the Gulf of California, precipitating a tidal wave moving north to transiently drown these lowlands. At the beginning of the story, Heinlein uses the character of a bartender in El Centro to establish the danger of the quake and inundation:

You&#x27;ve heard about the 1905 flood, when the Colorado River spilled over and formed the Salton Sea? But don&#x27;t be too sure about quakes; valleys below sea level don&#x27;t just grow—something has to cause them. The San Andreas Fault curls around this valley like a question mark. Just imagine the shake-up it must have taken to drop thousands of square miles below the level of the Pacific.

Due to its desert environment and proximity to Los Angeles, California, movies are sometimes filmed in the sand dunes outside the agricultural portions of the Imperial Valley. These have included:

* &quot;American Sniper&quot;
* &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;
* &quot;Independence Day&quot;
* &quot;Stargate&quot;
* &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;
* &quot;Patriot Games&quot;
* &quot;Into the Wild&quot;
* &quot;The Men who Stare at Goats&quot;
* &quot;La Bamba&quot;
* The original &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965) was filmed outside of Holtville.
* The Tom Cruise movie &quot;Losin&#x27; It&quot; (1983) was filmed in Calexico.
* &quot;Wake Island&quot; (1942). Most of the movie&#x27;s outside scenes were filmed at Salton Sea Lake in the Imperial Valley of California.

Additionally, portions of the 2005 film &quot;Jarhead&quot; were filmed here because of its similarity to the desert terrain of Iraq.

==Notable people==

<text>John George Haigh ( ; 24 July 1909 – 10 August 1949), commonly known as the Acid Bath Murderer, was an English serial killer convicted for the murder of six people, although he claimed to have killed nine. Haigh battered to death or shot his victims and disposed of their bodies using sulphuric acid before forging their signatures so he could sell their possessions and collect large sums of money. His actions were the subject of the television film &quot;A Is for Acid&quot;.

== Early life ==
John Haigh was born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, and raised in the village of Outwood, West Riding of Yorkshire. His parents were engineer John Robert Haigh and his wife Emily (née Hudson), members of the Plymouth Brethren, a conservative Protestant sect. They had married late in life and Haigh was their only child.

Haigh later claimed that he suffered from recurring religious nightmares in his childhood. He developed great proficiency at the piano, which he learned at home. He was fond of classical music and often attended concerts.

Haigh won a scholarship to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, then to Wakefield Cathedral, where he became a choirboy. After school, he was apprenticed to a firm of motor engineers. After a year, he left that job and took jobs in insurance and advertising. Aged 21, he was dismissed after being suspected of stealing from a cash box. After being fired, he moved on to forging car documents.

== Marriage and imprisonment ==
On 6 July 1934, Haigh married 23-year-old Beatrice &#x27;Betty&#x27; Hamer. The marriage soon disintegrated. The same year that Haigh was jailed for fraud, Betty gave birth to a baby girl while he was in prison, and she placed the baby for adoption and left Haigh. Haigh&#x27;s family ostracised him from then onwards.

Haigh moved to London in 1936, and became chauffeur to William McSwan, a wealthy owner of amusement arcades. He also maintained McSwan&#x27;s amusement machines. Thereafter he pretended to be a solicitor named William Cato Adamson with offices in Chancery Lane, London; Guildford, Surrey; and Hastings, Sussex. He sold fraudulent stock shares, purportedly from the estates of his deceased clients, at below-market rates. His scam was uncovered by someone who noticed he had misspelt Guildford as &quot;Guilford&quot; on his letterhead. Haigh received a four-year prison sentence for fraud. He was released just after the start of the Second World War; he continued as a fraudster and was sentenced to several further terms of imprisonment.

Regretting that he had left victims alive to accuse him, he became intrigued by French murderer Georges-Alexandre Sarret, who had disposed of bodies using sulphuric acid. Haigh experimented with field mice and found that it took only 30 minutes for the body to dissolve.

==&quot;Acid bath&quot; murders==
Haigh was freed from prison in 1943 and became an accountant with an engineering firm. Soon after, by chance, he encountered his former employer William McSwan in a Kensington pub. McSwan introduced Haigh to his parents, Donald and Amy. McSwan worked for them by collecting rents on their London properties, and Haigh became envious of his lifestyle. On 6 September 1944, McSwan disappeared. Haigh later admitted he had lured McSwan into a basement on Gloucester Road, hit him over the head with a lead pipe, and then put his body in a drum with concentrated sulphuric acid. Two days later, finding that McSwan&#x27;s body had mostly dissolved, Haigh emptied the drum into a manhole.

He told McSwan&#x27;s parents that their son had gone into hiding in Scotland to avoid being called up for military service. Haigh then began living in McSwan&#x27;s house and collecting rent for McSwan&#x27;s parents. They became curious as to why their son had not returned, as the war was coming to an end. On 2 July 1945, he lured them to Gloucester Road by telling them their son was back from Scotland for a surprise visit. There he killed them with blows to the head and disposed of them. Haigh then stole McSwan&#x27;s pension cheques and sold his parents&#x27; properties for around £8,000 (approximately £ in ). He then moved into the Onslow Court Hotel in Kensington.

Haigh was a gambler. By 1947, he was running short of money. To solve his financial troubles, he found another couple to kill and rob: Archibald Henderson and his wife Rose nee Burlin. Rose had been married to German inventor Rudolph Erren. 

After feigning interest in a house that they were selling, he was invited to the Hendersons&#x27; flat by Rose to play the piano for their housewarming party. While at the flat, Haigh stole Archibald Henderson&#x27;s revolver, planning to use it in his next crime. Renting a small workshop at 2 Leopold Road, Crawley, West Sussex, he moved acid and drums there from Gloucester Road. (Haigh was also known to have stayed at Crawley&#x27;s Hotel, The George, on several occasions.) On 12 February 1948, he drove Archibald Henderson to his workshop on the pretext of showing him an invention. When they arrived, Haigh shot Henderson in the head with the stolen revolver. Haigh then lured Rose Henderson to the workshop, claiming that her husband had fallen ill, and he shot her as well.

After disposing of the Hendersons&#x27; bodies in oil drums filled with acid, he forged a letter with their signatures and sold all of their possessions for £8,000, except for their car and dog, which he kept.

== Last victim and arrest ==
Haigh&#x27;s next and last victim was Olive Durand-Deacon, 69, the wealthy widow of solicitor John Durand-Deacon and a fellow resident at the Onslow Court Hotel. Haigh by then was calling himself an engineer, and he heard Olive talk to her friends about her idea for artificial fingernails. He invited her down to the Leopold Road workshop on 18 February 1949 and, once inside, he shot her in the back of the neck with the .38 calibre Webley revolver that he had stolen from Archibald Henderson, stripped her of her valuables, including a Persian lamb coat, and put her into the acid bath. Two days later, Durand-Deacon&#x27;s friend Constance Lane reported her missing.

Detectives soon discovered Haigh&#x27;s record of theft and fraud and searched the workshop. Police found Haigh&#x27;s attaché case containing a dry cleaner&#x27;s receipt for Olive Durand-Deacon&#x27;s coat, and also papers referring to the Hendersons and McSwans. The workshop in Sussex rented by Haigh did not contain a floor drain, unlike the workshop he had rented at Gloucester Road in London. He, therefore, disposed of the remains by pouring out the container on a rubble pile at the back of the property. Investigation of the area by pathologist Keith Simpson revealed of human body fat, part of a human foot, human gallstones and part of a denture which was later identified by Olive Durand-Deacon&#x27;s dentist during the trial.

Haigh asked Detective Inspector Albert Webb during questioning, &quot;Tell me, frankly, what are the chances of anybody being released from Broadmoor?&quot; (a high-security psychiatric hospital). The inspector said that he could not discuss that sort of thing, so Haigh replied, &quot;Well if I told you the truth, you would not believe me. It sounds too fantastic to believe.&quot;

Haigh then confessed that he had killed Durand-Deacon, the McSwans, and the Hendersons—as well as three other people: a young man called Max, a girl from Eastbourne, and a woman from Hammersmith. These claims could not be substantiated.

== Trial and execution ==
Haigh&#x27;s trial was held at Lewes assizes – evidence from the trial is now in the Crime Museum at New Scotland Yard. Haigh pleaded insanity, claiming that he had drunk the blood of his victims. He said he had dreams dominated by blood as a young boy. When he was involved in a car accident in March 1944, his dream returned to him: &quot;I saw before me a forest of crucifixes which gradually turned into trees. At first, there appeared to be dew or rain, dripping from the branches, but as I approached I realized it was blood. The whole forest began to writhe and the trees, dark and erect, to ooze blood... A man went from each tree catching the blood ... When the cup was full, he approached me. &#x27;Drink,&#x27; he said, but I was unable to move.&quot;

The Attorney-General, Sir Hartley Shawcross KC (later Lord Shawcross), led for the prosecution and urged the jury to reject Haigh&#x27;s defence of insanity because he had acted with malice aforethought.

Sir David Maxwell Fyfe KC, defending, called many witnesses to attest to Haigh&#x27;s mental state, including Henry Yellowlees, who claimed Haigh had a paranoid constitution, adding: &quot;The absolute callous, cheerful, bland and almost friendly indifference of the accused to the crimes which he freely admits having committed is unique in my experience.&quot;

Haigh apparently had believed (mistakenly) that if the bodies of his victims could not be found, a murder conviction would not be possible. It took only minutes for the jury to find him guilty. Mr Justice Humphreys sentenced him to death. On 10 August 1949, Haigh was hanged by executioner Albert Pierrepoint.

The case was one of the post-1945 cases which gained considerable coverage in the newspapers even though Haigh&#x27;s guilt was not questioned. The editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Silvester Bolam, was sentenced to a three-month prison term for contempt of court for describing Haigh as a &quot;murderer&quot; while the trial was still underway.

== Haigh&#x27;s confirmed victims ==
* McSwan family:
** William Donald McSwan (9 September 1944)
** Donald and Amy McSwan (2 July 1945)
* Henderson couple:
** Archibald and Rosalie Henderson (12 February 1948)
* Henrietta Helen Olivia Robarts Durand-Deacon, (18 February 1949)

== In popular culture ==

* The release of the 1949 British film noir &quot;Obsession&quot; was delayed by the British Board of Film Censors due to similarities in its plot to the Haigh case.
* The mid-1960s unproduced Hitchcock project &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; had been inspired by Haigh and serial killer Neville Heath.
* The role of Haigh was played by Martin Clunes in the ITV drama &quot;A Is for Acid&quot;.
* Nigel Fairs played Haigh in the Big Finish audio drama &quot;In Conversation with an Acid Bath Murderer&quot; (2011), which he also wrote. The cast included Richard Franklin as Archie Henderson, Mandi Symonds as Olive Durand-Deacon and Louise Jameson (who also directed) as Rose Henderson. It was released as the fourth instalment in their &quot;Drama Showcase&quot; anthology series.
* Stage play &quot;WAX&quot; by Micheal Punter is based upon a fictional meeting between Haigh and a woman (Anna), an artist from Madame Tussauds, who models his waxwork for exhibition in the &#x27;Chamber of Horrors&#x27; while he is in the condemned cell.

<doc id="441496" wikidata="Q463937" url="?curid=441496" title="Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands">
<text>Saint Thomas (, , ) is one of the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea, and a constituent district of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an unincorporated territory of the United States. Along with surrounding minor islands, it is one of three county equivalents in the USVI. Together with Saint John, it forms one of the districts of the USVI. The territorial capital and port of Charlotte Amalie is located on the island.

Of the three islands, St. Thomas is the second largest, with St. Croix being the largest, and St. John, the smallest. As of the 2010 census, the population of Saint Thomas was 51,634, about 48.5% of the total population of the United States Virgin Islands. Crown Mountain is the highest point in Saint Thomas and in the entire United States Virgin Islands. Hence, it is called &quot;Rock City&quot;. The island has a land area of .

==History==

=== Pre-colonial history ===
The island was originally settled around 1500 BC by the Ciboney people. Ciboney sites have been uncovered in Krum Bay. The island was later inhabited by the Arawaks and then the Caribs. Arawak sites have been uncovered in Magens Bay and Botany Bay, and Carib sites have been uncovered in Magens Bay.

=== Early European Exploration ===
Christopher Columbus sighted the island in 1493 on his second voyage to the New World. He landed on the island of Saint Croix and then made his way to the other islands nearby at the start of the Lesser Antilles, and named them &quot;Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Virgenes&quot;, after the legend of Saint Ursula and her 11,000 virgins. It was later shortened to &quot; Las Virgenes&quot;, which means, &quot;The Virgins&quot;.

===Danish colonial period===
The Dutch West India Company established a post on Saint Thomas in 1657. The first congregation was the St. Thomas Reformed Church, which was established in 1660 and was associated with the Dutch Reformed Church.

Denmark-Norway&#x27;s first attempt to settle the island in 1665 failed. However, the Danes did resettle St. Thomas in 1672, under the sponsorship of the Glueckstadt Co., later the Danish West India Company. The first slave ships arrived in 1673, and St. Thomas became a slave market. In 1685, the Danish leased part of the island to the Brandenburger Company, which was resold to the Danish in 1754, and was granted free port status in 1764.

The land was divided into plantations and sugarcane production became the primary economic activity. As a result, the economies of Saint Thomas and the neighboring islands of Saint John and Saint Croix became highly dependent on enslaved African labor and the African slave trade. 

Saint Thomas&#x27;s fine natural harbor became known as &quot;Taphus&quot; for the drinking establishments located nearby. (&quot;Tap Hus&quot; translates as &quot;rum shop&quot; or &quot;tap house&quot; referring to the drinking establishments.) In 1691, the primary settlement there was renamed Charlotte Amalia in honor of the wife of Denmark&#x27;s King Christian V. It was later declared a free port by Frederick V. In December 1732, the first two of many Moravian Brethren missionaries came from Herrnhut, Saxony in present-day Germany to minister to them. Distrusted at first by the white masters, they lived among the slaves and soon won their confidence.
The first British invasion and occupation of the island occurred in 1801. The islands were returned to Denmark in 1802, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. Fire destroyed hundreds of homes in Charlotte Amalie in 1804.
The second British occupation of the island occurred from 1807 to 1815, after the Invasion of the Danish West Indies (1807), during which they built Fort Cowell on Hassel Island.

While the sugar trade had brought prosperity to the island&#x27;s free citizens, by the early 19th century Saint Thomas was in decline. The continued export of sugar was threatened by hurricanes, drought, and American competition. Following the Danish Revolution of 1848, slavery was abolished and the resulting rise in labor costs further weakened the position of Saint Thomas&#x27;s sugar producers.

Given its harbors and fortifications, Saint Thomas still retained a strategic importance, and thus, in the 1860s, during the American Civil War and its aftermath, the United States government considered entering into a treaty with Denmark to buy the island and its neighbors from Denmark for $7.5 million. The Danish Landstinget agreed to the sale as did the inhabitants of the islands in a vote of 1,244 to 22. However, the proponents of the purchase in the United States failed to gain enough support to ratify the treaty.

===Freedom of the press===
In 1915, David Hamilton Jackson traveled to Denmark and convinced the King of Denmark to allow freedom of the press in Saint Thomas, Saint John, and Saint Croix. He began the first newspaper in the islands, known as &quot;The Herald&quot;. Jackson was the editor of &quot;The Herald&quot;, which had its office at 1B Kongens Gade in Christiansted. The newspaper&#x27;s focus was civic and labor rights for local workers, and it published criticisms of the labor situation in the islands. After beginning &quot;The Herald,&quot; Jackson organized labor unions among the islanders for better working conditions. He was also instrumental in persuading the Danish to allow the US to purchase the islands of Saint Thomas, Saint John, and Saint Croix. The islands now have an annual celebration in November to honor the legacy of David Hamilton Jackson.

=== United States acquisition ===

In 1917, Saint Thomas was purchased (along with Saint Croix and Saint John) by the United States for $25 million in gold ($ million today), as part of a strategy to maintain control over the Caribbean and the Panama Canal during the First World War. The transfer occurred on March 31, 1917.

At the time of the U.S. purchase in 1917, the colony did not include Water Island; Water Island had been sold by Denmark to the East Asiatic Company, a private shipping company, in 1905. The company eventually sold the island to the United States in 1944, during the German occupation of Denmark. The federal government then used the island for military purposes until 1950 before finally transferring it to the territorial government in 1996.

The United States granted citizenship to residents of the Virgin Islands in 1927. The U.S. Department of the Interior took over administrative duties in 1931. American forces were based on the island during the Second World War. In 1954, passage of the U.S. Virgin Islands Organic Act officially granted territorial status to the three islands, allowing for the formation of a local senate. Full home rule was achieved in 1970.

The post-war era also saw the rise of tourism on the island. With relatively cheap air travel and the American embargo on Cuba, the numbers of visitors greatly increased. Despite natural disasters such as Hurricanes Hugo (1989), Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn (1995), and Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2017), hotels have been built from the West End to the East End, and in recent years, Saint Thomas has become a busy cruise ship port and vacation venue.

==Geography==
The island has a number of natural bays and harbors including Magens Bay, Great Bay, Jersey Bay, Long Bay, Fortuna Bay, and Hendrik Bay. Passenger ships dock and anchor in Long Bay and Crown Bay, near Charlotte Amalie. Ships dock at West Indian Company Dock and Austin Monsanto Dock. Red Hook is an unofficial &quot;town&quot; located on the East End subdistrict.

=== Language ===
== Transportation ==


The island is serviced by the Cyril E. King International Airport. Passenger and limited car-ferry services to neighboring islands such as Water Island, Saint John, Saint Croix, and the British Virgin Islands run regularly out of the Red Hook Terminal, Charlotte Amalie Terminal, and Crown Bay Marina.

There are safaris, which are open air taxis, mounted onto the back of a pickup truck. The fare is typically $1 to $2 to go from one end of the island to the other.

The Virgin Islands also has a public transit system called the Virgin Islands Transit, or VITRAN, which services a fare of $1. These buses are discounted for both senior citizens and students with valid ID&#x27;s.

The United States Virgin Islands is the only place under United States jurisdiction where the rule of the road is to drive on the left. This was inherited from what was the then-current Danish practice at the time of the American acquisition in 1917. However, because the islands are a U.S. territory, most cars are imported from the mainland United States and therefore the steering column is located on the left side of the vehicle.

The island has many regular private taxis from compact size to large vans, as well as open-air, covered trucks called &quot;safaris&quot; with bench seats.

&quot;St. Thomas&quot; is among the most recognisable instrumentals in the repertoire of American jazz tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins based on a traditional calypso sung to him by his mother, Valborg Solomon Rollins, who was born on Saint Thomas.

The traditional music of the Virgin Islands is called quelbe, also known as scratch or fungi. This music style is performed using instruments made from gourds and everyday objects, with bands typically incorporating banjos, conga drums, washboards, triangles, saxophones, and flutes.

In addition to quelbe, other music styles such as calypso, reggae, soca, and hip hop are also popular among the islands.

There is a hip hop duo group called R. City, featuring brothers, Theron Thomas and Timothy Thomas. These brothers were born on the island of St. Thomas, and after graduating from high school on the island, they moved to the U.S. mainland to pursue their music careers. Their most notable song is &quot;Locked Away&quot;, featuring Adam Levine. R. City has collaborated with other artists, such as Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Drake, Nicki Minaj, and many more.

Coral World Ocean Park

Coral World Ocean Park is one of the most popular tourist attractions in St. Thomas, offering an indoor-outdoor aquarium experience.

The arboretum was neglected after the passing of Fairchild, but in 1974, the University of the Virgin Islands alongside the Charlotte Amalie Rotary Club began to restore it.

Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral

This Cathedral was the first Catholic church in the Danish West Indies, and bought from the Danish in 1802. Two years after it was built, in 1804, it was destroyed by fire.It was later restored, but was ravaged by a hurricane in 1837. Despite these challenges, it was rebuilt into its present form. Notably, the Cathedral&#x27;s ceilings are adorned with murals depicting over 11 scenes from both the Old and New Testaments.

St. Thomas Synagogue

Ranked among the five National Historic Landmarks in the U.S. Virgin Islands, this synagogue stands as the second-oldest in the United States. Originally constructed in 1803, it suffered several fires, leading to its reconstruction in 1833, and its eventual restoration in 2000. This is the home for the Hebrew Congregation of St. Thomas. It hosts weekly services and doubles as a museum, welcoming both locals and visitors to explore its rich heritage.

Mountain Top

It offers a variety of amenities such as a shopping center, restaurant, and bar. Visitors can also enjoy the observatory deck, which provides a view of cays, Puerto Rico, Culebra, and the British Virgin Islands. Additionally, Mountain Top is known as the birthplace of the banana daiquiri.

Drake&#x27;s Seat

Drake&#x27;s Seat, positioned on the Northside of St. Thomas, serves as a tourist destination, which offers a panoramic view of Magens Bay Beach. This location is easily identifiable by an open lookout area on one side of the road and a distinctive green bench that says, &quot;The Drake Seat&quot;, on the other. According to local lore, it was constructed by Sir Francis Drake, and English privateer, who used this spot as a point to survey the horizon for approaching enemy ships.

Three Queens Statue

A bronze monument of three important historical women: Queen Mary, Queen Agnes, and Queen Matilda. These three women led a revolution against the Danish Government, demanding enhanced working and living conditions, alongside fairer wages. This Revolution is known as the &quot;Fireburn&quot;. This statue is located in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas.

99 Steps

One of the many step-streets located in Charlotte Amalie. Of all the other step-streets it is the most popular. These steps were constructed during the 1700s by the Danish. Though its name is &quot;99 Steps&quot;, it actually has 103 steps. Crafted from bricks repurposed from the ballast of Danish ships, these steps wind their way up to Blackbeard&#x27;s Castle. It was originally named Store Taarne Gade, which means Greater Tower Street.
