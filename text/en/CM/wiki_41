<text>The C class was a class of 32 destroyers of the Royal Navy that were launched from 1943 to 1945. The class was built in four flotillas of 8 vessels, the &quot;Ca&quot;, &quot;Ch&quot;, &quot;Co&quot; and &quot;Cr&quot; groups or sub-classes, ordered as the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th Emergency Flotillas respectively. The sub-class names are derived from the initial 2 letters of the member ships&#x27; names, although the &quot;Ca&quot; class were originally ordered with a heterogeneous mix of traditional destroyer names. A fifth flotilla, the &quot;Ce&quot; or 15th Emergency Flotilla, was planned but were cancelled in favour of the s after only the first two ships had been ordered. The pennant numbers were all altered from &quot;R&quot; superior to &quot;D&quot; superior at the close of World War II; this involved some renumbering to avoid duplications.

==Design==
They were built as part of the War Emergency Programme, based on the hull and machinery of the pre-war J class, incorporating whatever advances in armament and naval radar were available at the time. Some of the class were completed in time for wartime service. All ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock High Angle Fire Control Computer.

The &quot;Ca&quot; flotilla were generally repeats of the preceding Z class, and as such had a main gun armament of four QF 4.5-inch (113-mm) Mk IV guns on Mk V mounts, which could elevate to 55 degrees to give an anti-aircraft capability. Close-in anti-aircraft armament generally consisted of two 40mm Bofors guns in a twin stabilized Hazemayer mount, supplemented by four single 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti aircraft guns on power operated mounts. &quot;Caprice&quot; differed in having a quadruple 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; instead of the Hazemayer Bofors mount, while &quot;Cassandra&quot; had eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannon instead of the single pom-poms. Torpedo armament consisted of eight torpedoes in two quadruple mounts, while 70 depth charges could be carried.

The succeeding &quot;Ch&quot;, &quot;Co&quot; and &quot;Cr&quot; flotillas were fitted with the new Mk VI HA/LA Director instead of the Mk I Type K director of the Z and Ca classes, while remote power control (RPC) gunlaying equipment was fitted. The additional weight of the new fire control equipment and the powered mountings for the 4.5 inch guns meant that only one quadruple torpedo mount was fitted, and the depth charge armament was reduced to 35 depth charges. Most of the ships were fitted with a single Hazemayer Bofors mount, although some of the later ships instead had the lighter and simpler Mk V twin Bofors mount. This was normally supplemented by two power operated single pom-pom mounts and two 20 mm Oerlikon cannon. They also introduced the all-welded hull into Royal Navy destroyer construction, beginning in &quot;Contest&quot;, with the &quot;Cr&quot; flotilla all being of all-welded construction. Late delivery of the Mk VI directors delayed completion such that all but one of the &quot;Ch&quot;s, &quot;Co&quot;s or &quot;Cr&quot;s entered service after the end of the Second World War. Only &quot;Comet&quot; was commissioned before VJ Day, in June 1945, albeit too late to see action.

&quot;Caprice&quot; was the last destroyer built for the Royal Navy to be fitted with the ubiquitous quadruple QF 2 pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounting Mark VII.

The &quot;Ca&quot; flotilla were reconstructed in the late 1950s and early 1960s to be modernised for anti-submarine warfare and to serve as fast fleet escorts. One bank of torpedo tubes and one 4.5 in gun was removed, allowing two Squid triple-barreled anti-submarine mortars to be fitted, while the ships&#x27; obsolete gun Mk I Type K director was replaced by a modern Mk 6M director as fitted to Royal Navy frigates, and the remaining 4.5 in guns fitted with RPC. Close in anti-aircraft armament was standardised as a single Mk V twin and two single 40 mm Bofors mounts. The ships were also fitted with new bridges; the post-refit bridge differed between the first four conversions (&quot;Cavendish&quot;, &quot;Carron&quot;, &quot;Cavalier&quot; and &quot;Carysfort&quot;), with open bridges and the later four (&quot;Caprice&quot;, &quot;Cassandra&quot;, &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Cambrian&quot;) which were given frigate-type enclosed bridges.

The remaining &quot;Ch&quot;, &quot;Co&quot; and Cr&quot; ships in the Royal Navy were given a less extensive modernisation, with one 4.5 in gun being replaced by twin Squids, modified fire control and a close in anti aircraft armament of 1 twin and four single Bofors guns. &quot;Chieftain&quot;, &quot;Chaplet&quot; and &quot;Comet&quot; were fitted as minelayers.

===Engineering===
The class were all fitted with two Admiralty 3-drum boilers with a pressure of at . All had Parsons single-reduction geared turbines, generating at 350 RPM, and driving the two shafts to produce a maximum of ( under full load condition). All were engined by their builders except &quot;Cossack&quot; and &quot;Constance&quot;, which were engined by Parsons. Their bunkers could hold 615 tons of oil fuel, giving them a radius of at and at .

==Ships==

===&quot;Ca&quot; (or 11th Emergency) Flotilla===

This flotilla was authorised under the 1941 Programme. The first pair was ordered from Yarrow on 16 February 1942; the other six were ordered on 24 March, a pair each from John Brown, Scotts and Cammell Laird. However, on 12 August 1942 the contract for the last pair was moved from Cammell Laird to White. Their originally-allocated names were altered to new names beginning with &quot;Ca-&quot; in November 1942. The John Brown pair - &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Cavendish&quot; - were fitted as Leaders.

On completion they formed the 6th Destroyer Flotilla for service in the Home Fleet. At the end of the war in Europe the flotilla was transferred to the East Indies Fleet and the ships arrived on station between August and November 1945, too late to see service against Japan. They remained in the Indian Ocean until May 1946 when they returned home and paid off into operational reserve.


===&quot;Ch&quot; (or 12th Emergency) Flotilla===

Six destroyers, the first of 26 &#x27;Intermediate&#x27; destroyers to be authorised under the 1942 Programme, were ordered on 24 July 1942, a pair each from Thornycroft, Scotts and Alexander Stephen. The fourth pair was originally intended to be ordered from Vickers Armstrongs, Walker-on-Tyne, but instead were ordered from Denny on 30 July. The &quot;Chequers&quot; and &quot;Childers&quot; were fitted as Leaders.


===&quot;Co&quot; (or 13th Emergency) Flotilla===

The first four of these destroyers were ordered in August 1942 - &quot;Comus&quot; and &quot;Concord&quot; on 7th, &quot;Contest&quot; on 12th and &quot;Consort&quot; on 14th. The remaining four destroyers were ordered on 12 September; &quot;Constance&quot; and &quot;Cossack&quot; were fitted as Leaders.

===&quot;Cr&quot; (or 14th Emergency) Flotilla===

All eight destroyers were ordered on 12 September 1942, two each from John Brown, Yarrow, White and Scotts; the John Brown pair - &quot;Crescent&quot; and &quot;Crusader&quot; - were fitted as Leaders.


===&quot;Ce&quot; (or 15th Emergency) Flotilla===

Two ships of this putative flotilla, the last of the 26 &quot;Intermediate&quot;-type destroyers authorised under the 1942 Programme, were ordered on 3 February 1942 from White. These two ships were to be named &quot;Centaur&quot; and &quot;Celt&quot;. However, with the decision to introduce a fresh design of Intermediate destroyer (which became the design), the White orders were amended to the new design and the names of the two ships were altered to &quot;Tomahawk&quot; and &quot;Sword&quot; respectively. &quot;Tomahawk&quot; was subsequently renamed again, becoming &quot;Scorpion&quot;, while &quot;Sword&quot; was finally cancelled on 15 October 1945.

<doc id="1206600" wikidata="Q2614349" url="?curid=1206600" title="Oda Nobutaka">
<text>was a samurai and member of the Oda clan. He was adopted as the head of the Kanbe clan, which ruled the middle region of Ise Province and so he was also called Kanbe Nobutaka (神戸信孝).

==Biography==
Nobutaka was born as the third son of Oda Nobunaga and he was called &quot;San Shichi&quot; (三七), possibly because he was born on the seventh day of the third month, in the Japanese lunar calendar system. His mother was a concubine named &quot;Sakashi&quot; (坂氏). A theory has it that Nobutaka was actually born twenty days earlier than Nobunaga&#x27;s second son Oda Nobukatsu but it was reported later than Nobukatsu&#x27;s birth to Nobunaga and thus he was acknowledged as the third son. According to this theory, it is also believed that the low status of his mother&#x27;s parents had played a factor as well.

In 1568, after Nobunaga controlled Ise Province, Nobutaka was installed as the head of the Kanbe clan, whose seat was Kanbe Castle, near present-day Suzuka, Mie. The next year, his elder brother, Nobukatsu, became an adopted member of the Kitabatake clan, and ruled a much larger area of southern Ise Province. Nobutaka was reported by missionaries to have a better character than the older Nobukatsu but was ranked lower and held less area than he did.

In 1577, he besieged Ōta Castle (near the site of present-day Wakayama Castle) and defeated Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist (Saika Ikki) uprising in Kii province.

In 1582, Nobutaka was commanded to lead an army against Shikoku and had such retainers as Niwa Nagahide and Tsuda Nobuzumi, who was the son of Nobunaga&#x27;s younger brother Nobuyuki, under his command.

===Death of Nobunaga===
While readying his army to cross the sea at Sakai, Nobunaga died at Honnō-ji during an attack by Akechi Mitsuhide. Nobutaka turned back and at Osaka, killed Nobusumi, who was married to a daughter of Mitsuhide. While Nobutaka&#x27;s suspicion did make some sense, no evidence had turned up that would connect Nobusumi to Mitsuhide. Nobutaka then joined Hashiba Hideyoshi who had turned back from his own campaign, and they fought the Akechi forces at the Battle of Yamazaki.

Nobutaka and his brother Oda Nobukatsu then quarreled over Nobunaga&#x27;s succession at a council held in Kiyosu Castle. Oda Hidenobu was then declared heir.

Nobutaka gained Mino Province where the eldest son, Oda Nobutada had ruled before his death by Mitsuhide, but this was still far short of what he had hoped to gain.
===Conflict with Hideyoshi===
In 1583, he later allied with Shibata Katsuie and Takigawa Kazumasu to start a war against Hideyoshi, but while Nobutaka was surrounded at Gifu Castle by Nobukatsu, Katsuie lost the Battle of Shizugatake, also Kazumasu lost at Kameyama, and Nobutaka surrendered.

Nobutaka was sent to Daimidoji at Noma, Chita county, in Owari Province where Minamoto no Yoshitomo had been assassinated at the end of the Heian period.

==Death==
Under pressure from Hideyoshi and Nobukatsu, he committed suicide. Two dates on 1583, June 19 and June 21 are given for his death.

His waka composed before dying was as follows:
:昔より 主を討つ身の 野間なれば
::&quot;Mukashi yori Shuu o Utsu Mi no Noma nareba&quot;
:報いを待てや 羽柴筑前
::&quot;Mukui o Mateya Hashiba Chikuzen&quot;
It is a vengeful poem that would be translated as, &quot;You had killed the one you had served / may the gods strike you down, Hashiba Hideyoshi&quot;.

<doc id="1206605" wikidata="Q4680750" url="?curid=1206605" title="Adaptive management">
<text>Adaptive management, also known as adaptive resource management or adaptive environmental assessment and management, is a structured, iterative process of robust decision making in the face of uncertainty, with an aim to reducing uncertainty over time via system monitoring. In this way, decision making simultaneously meets one or more resource management objectives and, either passively or actively, accrues information needed to improve future management. Adaptive management is a tool which should be used not only to change a system, but also to learn about the system. Because adaptive management is based on a learning process, it improves long-run management outcomes. The challenge in using the adaptive management approach lies in finding the correct balance between gaining knowledge to improve management in the future and achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge. This approach has more recently been employed in implementing international development programs.

==Objectives==
There are a number of scientific and social processes which are vital components of adaptive management, including:
* Management is linked to appropriate temporal and spatial scales
* Management retains a focus on statistical power and controls
* Use of computer models to build synthesis and an embodied ecological consensus
* Use of embodied ecological consensus to evaluate strategic alternatives
* Communication of alternatives to political arena for negotiation of a selection

The achievement of these objectives requires an open management process which seeks to include past, present and future stakeholders. Adaptive management needs to at least maintain political openness, but usually aims to create it. Adaptive management must therefore be a scientific and social process. It must focus on the development of new institutions and institutional strategies in balance with scientific hypothesis and experimental frameworks (resilience.org).

Adaptive management can proceed as either passive or active adaptive management, depending on how learning takes place. Passive adaptive management values learning only insofar as it improves decision outcomes (i.e. passively), as measured by the specified utility function. In contrast, active adaptive management explicitly incorporates learning as part of the objective function, and hence, decisions which improve learning are valued over those which do not. In both cases, as new knowledge is gained, the models are updated and optimal management strategies are derived accordingly. Thus, while learning occurs in both cases, it is treated differently. Often, deriving actively adaptive policies is technically very difficult, which prevents it being more commonly applied.

==Features==
Key features of both passive and active adaptive management are:
*Iterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*Feedback between monitoring and decisions (learning)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference
*Bayesian inference
*Embracing risk and uncertainty as a way of building understanding

However, a number of process failures related to information feedback can prevent effective adaptive management decision making:

* data collection is never completely implemented
* data are collected but not analyzed
* data are analyzed but results are inconclusive
* data are analyzed and are interesting, but are not presented to decision makers
* data are analyzed and presented, but are not used for decision-making because of internal or external factors

==History==
The use of adaptive management techniques can be traced back to peoples from ancient civilisations. For example, the Yap people of Micronesia have been using adaptive management techniques to sustain high population densities in the face of resource scarcity for thousands of years (Falanruw 1984). In using these techniques, the Yap people have altered their environment creating, for example, coastal mangrove depressions and seagrass meadows to support fishing and termite resistant wood (Stankey and Shinder 1997).

The origin of the adaptive management concept can be traced back to ideas of scientific management pioneered by Frederick Taylor in the early 1900s (Haber 1964). While the term &quot;adaptive management&quot; evolved in natural resource management workshops through decision makers, managers and scientists focussing on building simulation models to uncover key assumptions and uncertainties (Bormann &quot;et al.&quot; 1999)

Two ecologists at The University of British Columbia, C.S. Holling and C.J Walters further developed the adaptive management approach as they distinguished between passive and active adaptive management practice. Kai Lee, notable Princeton physicist, expanded upon the approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s while pursuing a post-doctorate degree at UC Berkeley. The approach was further developed at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Vienna, Austria, while C.S. Holling was director of the institute. In 1992, Hilbourne described three learning models for federal land managers, around which adaptive management approaches could be developed, these are reactive, passive and active.

Adaptive management has probably been most frequently applied in Yap, Australia and North America, initially applied in fishery management, but received more broad application in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most successful applications of adaptive management has been in the area of waterfowl harvest management in North America, most notably for the mallard.

Adaptive management in a conservation project and program context can trace its roots back to at least the early 1990s, with the establishment of the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP) in 1989. BSP was a USAID-funded consortium of WWF The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and World Resources Institute (WRI). Its Analysis and Adaptive Management Program sought to understand the conditions under which certain conservation strategies were most effective and to identify lessons learned across conservation projects. When BSP ended in 2001, TNC and Foundations of Success (FOS, a non-profit which grew out of BSP) continued to actively work in promoting adaptive management for conservation projects and programs. The approaches used included Conservation by Design (TNC) and Measures of Success (FOS).

In 2004, the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) – which includes several former BSP members – developed a common set of standards and guidelines for applying adaptive management to conservation projects and programs.

==Use in environmental practices==
Applying adaptive management in a conservation or ecosystem management project involves the integration of project/program design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order to adapt and learn. The three components of adaptive management in environmental practice are:

*&quot;Testing assumptions&quot; is about systematically trying different actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is not, however, a random trial-and-error process. Rather, it involves using knowledge about the specific site to pick the best known strategy, laying out the assumptions behind how that strategy will work, and then collecting monitoring data to determine if the assumptions hold true.
*&quot;Adaptation&quot; involves changing assumptions and interventions to respond to new or different information obtained through monitoring and project experience.
*&quot;Learning&quot; is about explicitly documenting a team&#x27;s planning and implementation processes and its successes and failures for internal learning as well as learning across the conservation community. This learning enables conservation practitioners to design and manage projects better and avoid some of the perils others have encountered. Learning about a managed system is only useful in cases where management decisions are repeated.

==Application to environmental projects and programs==
&quot;Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation&quot; lays out five main steps to an adaptive management project cycle (see Figure 1). The &quot;Open Standards&quot; represent a compilation and adaptation of best practices and guidelines across several fields and across several organizations within the conservation community. Since the release of the initial &quot;Open Standards&quot; (updated in 2007 and 2013), thousands of project teams from conservation organizations (e.g., TNC, Rare, and WWF), local conservation groups, and donors alike have begun applying these &quot;Open Standards&quot; to their work. In addition, several CMP members have developed training materials and courses to help apply the Standards.

Some recent write-ups of adaptive management in conservation include wildlife protection (SWAP, 2008), forests ecosystem protection (CMER, 2010), coastal protection and restoration (LACPR, 2009), natural resource management (water, land and soil), species conservation especially, fish conservation from overfishing (FOS, 2007) and climate change (DFG, 2010). In addition, some other examples follow:
*In 2006–2007, FOS worked with The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to develop an evaluation system help NFWF gauge impact across the various coral reef habitat and species conservation projects;
*In 2007, FOS worked with the Ocean Conservancy (OC) to evaluate the effectiveness of this Scorecard in helping to end overfishing in domestic fisheries.
*Between 1999 and 2004, FOS worked for WWF&#x27;s Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) Program to ensure that Asian elephants and rhinos thrive in secure habitats within their historical range and in harmony with people.
*The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is developing and implementing adaptation strategies to help protect, restore and manage fish and wildlife, with the understanding that some level of climate change will occur and that it will have profound effects on ecosystems in the United States.
*The Adaptive Management program was created by CMR to provide science-based recommendations and technical information to assist the Forest Practices Board. In April 2010, the Forest Practices Adaptive Management Annual Science Conference was held in Washington.
*In 2009, The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) Technical Report has been developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) according to adaptive management process.
*Since 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service has been managing its marine protected areas using adaptive management in an ongoing process of learning through the Science for Active Management (SAM) Program.

==In international development==

The concept of adaptive management is not restricted to natural resources or ecosystem management, as similar concepts have been applied to international development programming. This has often been a recognition to the &quot;wicked&quot; nature of many development challenges and the limits of traditional planning processes. One of the principal changes facing international development organizations is the need to be more flexible, adaptable and focused on learning. This is reflected in international development approaches such as Doing Development Differently, Politically Informed Programming and Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation.

One recent example of the use of adaptive management by international development donors is the planned Global Learning for Adaptive Management (GLAM) programme to support adaptive management in Department for International Development and USAID. The program is establishing a centre for learning about adaptive management to support the utilization and accessibility of adaptive management. In addition, donors have been focused on amending their own programmatic guidance to reflect the importance of learning within programs: for instance, USAID&#x27;s recent focus in their ADS guidance on the importance of collaborating, learning and adapting. This is also reflected in Department for International Development&#x27;s Smart Rules that provide the operating framework for their programs including the use of evidence to inform their decisions. There are a variety of tools used to operationalize adaptive management in programs, such as learning agendas and decision cycles.

Collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA) is a concept related to the operationalizing of adaptive management in international development that describes a specific way of designing, implementing, adapting and evaluating programs. CLA involves three concepts:
#collaborating intentionally with stakeholders to share knowledge and reduce duplication of effort,
#learning systematically by drawing on evidence from a variety of sources and taking the time to reflect on implementation, and
#adapting strategically based on applied learning. CLA practices have tangible benefits; for instance, a recent study recently found that companies &quot;which apply more data-driven and adaptive leadership practices perform better&quot; when examined against those which focus less on those practices.

CLA integrates three closely connected concepts within the organizational theory literature: namely collaborating, learning and adapting. There is evidence of the benefits of collaborating internally within an organization and externally with organizations. Much of the production and transmission of knowledge—both explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge—occurs through collaboration. There is evidence for the importance of collaboration among individuals and groups for innovation, knowledge production, and diffusion—for example, the benefits of staff interacting with one another and transmitting knowledge. The importance of collaboration is closely linked to the ability of organizations to collectively learn from each other, a concept noted in the literature on learning organizations.

CLA, an adaptive management practice, is being employed by implementing partners that receive funding from the federal government of the United States, but it is primarily a framework for internal change efforts that aim at incorporating collaboration, learning, and adaptation within the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) including its missions located around the world. CLA has been linked to a part of USAID&#x27;s commitment to becoming a learning organization. CLA represents an approach to combine strategic collaboration, continuous learning, and adaptive management. A part of integrating the CLA approach is providing tools and resources, such as the Learning Lab, to staff and partner organizations. The CLA approach is detailed for USAID staff in the recently revised program policy guidance.

==Use in other practices as a tool for sustainability==
Adaptive management as a systematic process for improving environmental management policies and practices is the traditional application however, the adaptive management framework can also be applied to other sectors seeking sustainability solutions such as business and community development. Adaptive management as a strategy emphasizes the need to change with the environment and to learn from doing. Adaptive management applied to ecosystems makes overt sense when considering ever changing environmental conditions. The flexibility and constant learning of an adaptive management approach is also a logical application for organizations seeking sustainability methodologies.
Businesses pursuing sustainability strategies would employ an adaptive management framework to ensure that the organization is prepared for the unexpected and geared for change. By applying an adaptive management approach the business begins to function as an integrated system adjusting and learning from a multi-faceted network of influences not just environmental but also, economic and social (Dunphy, Griffths, &amp; Benn, 2007). The goal of any sustainable organization guided by adaptive management principals must be to engage in active learning to direct change towards sustainability (Verine, 2008). This &quot;learning to manage by managing to learn&quot; (Bormann BT, 1993) will be at the core of a sustainable business strategy.

Sustainable community development requires recognition of the relationship between environment, economics and social instruments within the community. An adaptive management approach to creating sustainable community policy and practice also emphasizes the connection and confluence of those elements. Looking into the cultural mechanisms which contribute to a community value system often highlights the parallel to adaptive management practices, &quot;with [an] emphasis on feedback learning, and its treatment of uncertainty and unpredictability&quot; (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000). Often this is the result of indigenous knowledge and historical decisions of societies deeply rooted in ecological practices (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000). By applying an adaptive management approach to community development the resulting systems can develop built in sustainable practice as explained by the Environmental Advisory Council (2002), &quot;active adaptive management views policy as a set of experiments designed to reveal processes that build or sustain resilience. It requires, and facilitates, a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options&quot; (p. 1121). A practical example of adaptive management as a tool for sustainability was the application of a modified variation of adaptive management using artvoice, photovoice, and agent-based modeling in a participatory social framework of action. This application was used in field research on tribal lands to first identify the environmental issue and impact of illegal trash dumping and then to discover a solution through iterative agent-based modeling using NetLogo on a theoretical &quot;regional cooperative clean-energy economy&quot;. This cooperative economy incorporated a mixed application of: traditional trash recycling and a waste-to-fuels process of carbon recycling of non-recyclable trash into ethanol fuel. This industrial waste-to-fuels application was inspired by pioneering work of the Canadian-based company, Enerkem. See Bruss, 2012 - PhD dissertation: Human Environment Interactions and Collaborative Adaptive Capacity Building in a Resilience Framework, GDPE Colorado State University.

In an ever-changing world, adaptive management appeals to many practices seeking sustainable solutions by offering a framework for decision making that proposes to support a sustainable future which, &quot;conserves and nurtures the diversity—of species, of human opportunity, of learning institutions and of economic options&quot;(The Environmental Advisory Council, 2002, p. 1121).

== Effectiveness ==
It is difficult to test the effectiveness of adaptive management in comparison to other management approaches. One challenge is that once a system is managed using one approach it is difficult to determine how another approach would have performed in exactly the same situation. One study tested the effectiveness of formal passive adaptive management in comparison to human intuition by having natural resource management students make decisions about how to harvest a hypothetical fish population in an online computer game. The students on average performed poorly in comparison to the computer programs implementing passive adaptive management.

Collaborative adaptive management is often celebrated as an effective way to deal with natural resource management under high levels of conflict, uncertainty and complexity. The effectiveness of these efforts can be constrained by both social and technical barriers. As the case of the Glenn Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program in the US illustrates, effective collaborative adaptive management efforts require clear and measurable goals and objectives, incentives and tools to foster collaboration, long-term commitment to monitoring and adaptation, and straightforward joint fact-finding protocols. In Colorado, USA, a ten-year, ranch-scale (2590 ha) experiment began in 2012 at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Central Plains Experimental range to evaluate the effectiveness and process of collaborative adaptive management on rangelands. The Collaborative Adaptive Rangeland Management or “CARM” project monitors outcomes from yearling steer grazing management on 10, 130 ha pastures conducted by a group of conservationists, ranchers, and public employees, and researchers. This team compares ecological monitoring data tracking profitability and conservation outcomes with outcomes from a “traditional” management treatment: a second set of ten pastures managed without adaptive decision making but with the same stocking rate. Early evaluations of the project by social scientists offer insights for more effective adaptive management. First, trust is primary and essential to learning in adaptive management, not a side benefit. Second, practitioners cannot assume that extensive monitoring data or large-scale efforts will automatically facilitate successful collaborative adaptive management. Active, long-term efforts to build trust among scientists and stakeholders are also important. Finally, explicit efforts to understand, share and respect multiple types of manager knowledge, including place-based ecological knowledge practiced by local managers, is necessary to manage adaptively for multiple conservation and livelihood goals on rangelands. Practitioners can expect adaptive management to be a complex, non-linear process shaped by social, political and ecological processes, as well as by data collection and interpretation.

<text>Louis Jacques Napoléon Bertrand, better known by his pen name Aloysius Bertrand (20 April 1807 — 29 April 1841), was a French Romantic poet, playwright and journalist. He is famous for having introduced prose poetry in French literature, and is considered a forerunner of the Symbolist movement. His masterpiece is the collection of prose poems &quot;Gaspard de la Nuit&quot; published posthumously in 1842; three of its poems were adapted to an eponymous piano suite by Maurice Ravel in 1908.

== Biography ==
=== Background ===

Born in Ceva on 20 April 1807, Louis Jacques Napoléon Bertrand was the son of Georges and Laure (or Laurine-Marie) Bertrand, &quot;née&quot; Davico. Georges Bertrand was born on 22 July 1768 at Sorcy-Saint-Martin (or Saulieu, according to other sources) into a family of soldiers. A &quot;gendarmerie&quot; lieutenant, his parents wanted him to become a priest but he ran away from the seminary and enlisted in the 16e régiment de dragons of Orléans on 7 May 1785. His first marriage with Marie-Jeanne Rémond (born in Montbard on 23 February 1779) gave birth to a daughter, Denise, on 9 March 1800 but his wife died three months later. He married his second wife during his stay in the Department of Montenotte (now the Province of Cuneo), Laure Davico (born 2 August 1782), on 3 June 1806 in Ceva. After the birth of Louis, the eldest, in 1807, a second son, Jean Balthazar, was born on 17 July 1808.

On 15 March 1812 Georges was appointed as &quot;gendarmerie&quot; captain in Spoleto, whose mayor was at the time Pierre-Louis Roederer. There, on 23 December, the poet&#x27;s sister Isabella-Caroline (or Elizabeth) was born. On 3 September 1814 he was assigned to Mont-de-Marsan, where he made the acquaintance of Charles Jean Harel, then-prefect of the Department of Landes. Retiring at the end of August 1815, he left Landes and moved to Dijon, where on 19 March 1816 his fourth child was born, Charles Frédéric (who later became a journalist), and where his daughter Denise from his first marriage got married on 11 January 1818.

===A young romantic===

Louis Bertrand studied from 1818 to 1826 at the collège royal of Dijon, where he spent most of his life. Among his classmates were Lacordaire and Antoine Tenant de Latour, who would help him later. While in Dijon, Louis Bertrand developed an interest in the Burgundian capital. His father died on 27 February 1828 and he had to sustain the home on his own, receiving financial help from his aunt François-Marguerite also known as “Lolotte”. In the local literary paper “Le Provincial”, which had published the first verses of the poet Alfred de Musset, he promoted his avant-garde aesthetic views and published around twenty works in prose and in verse. Still in 1828, it seems he loved an anonymous young girl who might have died; traces of her existence can be found throughout Bertrand&#x27;s entire works.

===First trip to Paris and return to Dijon===
Encouraged by a laudatory letter from Hugo following a poem published in the journal that he had dedicated to him and by recognition from Sainte-Beuve, he moved to Paris at the beginning of November 1828. He met Sainte-Beuve at the salon of Émile Deschamps and read some of his prose to him. But he felt ashamed of his social status and could not find a place among the Parisian romantics. He got sick in January 1829 and during Spring found a publisher, Sautelet, to publish his poems, but he went bankrupt in August. He then got interested in the theatre and offered a play to the Vaudeville without success. After that, he decided to return to Dijon on 4 April 1830 and collaborated with the “Spectateur”, a newly-founded liberal newspaper. On 15 February 1831, under the name “Ludovic Bertrand”, he became chief editor of the newspaper “Patriote de la Côte-d’Or” until December 1832, in which he displayed his republican opinions with virulence

===Final years in Paris===
In January 1833, he went back to Paris. Soon after, the publisher Eugène Renduel agreed to publish “Gaspard”, announcing even it would come out in October. He became a secretary for baron Roederer. He wrote “Peter Waldeck ou la chute d’un homme”, a play with chants in 3 acts and 6 tableaux inspired by the “Adventures of Martin Waldeck” by Walter Scott. 
In Spring of 1834, he met Célestine F., to whom he proposed. According to Jacques Bony, his mother did not agree to the union, according to Max Milner his love was one-sided. Between 1835 and 1837, he was in serious financial difficulties and had to borrow money from a lot of people. He contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to Notre-Dame de la Pitié on 18 September 1838 where he remained until 13 May 1839 before being transferred to l’hôpital Saint-Antoine where he stayed until 24 November. 
In October 1839, a publisher had agreed to publish “Gaspard de la Nuit” and even printed flyers announcing its upcoming publication but the project never came to an end while Bertrand was alive. In 1840, he believed he was cured of the disease and started to write verse again. He tried at last to contact the publisher in hopes of finally publishing his manuscript on 5 October, but the publisher had stopped his activity. 
Sickness forced him to go back to the hospital on 11 March 1841. He died there in the morning on 29 April 1841. His close family, mother and sister, did not come to the hospital, nor did they attend his funeral. His mother died in 1854.

===Posterity===

“Gaspard de la Nuit” was finally published in November 1842. It sold 20 copies. However, this edition was full of mistakes due to an inaccurate copy of the manuscript. In 1925, Bertrand Guégan published a new edition from an original manuscript that corrected most of the mistakes. It is only in 1992, when an original calligraphed manuscript was acquired by the Bibliothèque nationale, that the book could be published according to the will of its author, with an accurate display of the text and illustrations. 
In 1862, Charles Baudelaire admitted in a letter he was deeply influenced by Bertrand&#x27;s work when writing “Spleen de Paris. Théodore de Banville, an admirer and later rival of Baudelaire, also quoted Bertrand as a main inspiration in the opening of his book “La Lanterne Magique” in 1883. He became a cult author for the Symbolists, especially for Stéphane Mallarmé who discovered him at the age of twenty and referenced his work throughout his entire life. 
However, it is only in the 20th century that his work was really recognized. Max Jacob brought attention to Bertrand by making him the inventor of prose poetry. Afterwards, the Surrealists contributed to his fame, especially André Breton who referenced him in his 1924 “Surrealist Manifesto”. René Magritte named one of his paintings “Gaspard de la nuit”, as it was inspired by the poem “Le Maçon”. Maurice Ravel wrote three piano solos on themes from “Gaspard de la nuit”, which is considered one of the most difficult pieces of the entire piano repertoire. Since 1922, there has been an Aloysius Bertrand street in Dijon.

<doc id="1206615" wikidata="Q1543806" url="?curid=1206615" title="Micro pitting">
<text>Micro pitting is a fatigue failure of the surface of a material commonly seen in rolling bearings and gears. It is also known as grey staining, micro spalling or frosting.

==Pitting and micropitting==
The difference between pitting and micropitting is the size of the pits after surface fatigue. Pits formed by micropitting are approximately 10–20 μm in depth, and to the unaided eye, micropitting appears dull, etched or stained, with patches of gray. Normal pitting creates larger and more visible pits. Micropits are originated from the local contact of asperities produced by improper lubrication.

==Causes==
In a normal bearing the surfaces are separated by a layer of oil, this is known as elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication. If the thickness of the EHD film is of the same order of magnitude as the surface roughness, the surface topography is able to interact and cause micro pitting. A thin EHD film may be caused by excess load or temperature, a lower oil viscosity than is required, low speed or water in the oil. Water in the oil can make micro pitting worse by causing hydrogen embrittlement of the surface. Micro pitting occurs only under poor EHD lubrication conditions and although it can affect all types of gears, it can be particularly troublesome in heavily loaded gears with hardened teeth.

A surface with a deep scratch might break exactly at the scratch if stress is applied. One can imagine that the surface roughness is a composite of many very small scratches. So high surface roughness decreases the stability on heavy stressed parts. To get a good overview of the surface an areal scan (Surface metrology) gives more information that a measurement along a single profile (profileometer). To quantify the surface roughness the ISO 25178 can be used.

== Calculation ==
ISO/TS 6336-22 contains a method for a calculation of risk of micropitting in gear sets.

<doc id="1206622" wikidata="Q6731950" url="?curid=1206622" title="Magnolia Springs State Park">
<text>Magnolia Springs State Park is a Georgia state park located between Perkins and Millen in Jenkins County. The park was built as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps and opened in 1939. The park is well known for its crystal clear springs that are estimated to flow per day. The park also offers unique wildlife near the springs, including alligators, turtles, and a variety of birds and fish.

During the American Civil War, the area that now comprises the day-use area of the park was used as a prison, Camp Lawton, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The park still houses remnants of the earthen fort that guarded the 10,000-prisoner camp. Two huge timbers, possibly from the prison but more likely from work done by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1938 and 1942, were recovered from the spring run.

The park has 26 tent/RV campsites, eight fully furnished cottages with central HVAC and satellite TV a, a 16-person Group Lodge with satellite TV and screened back porch, and a new History Center that currently displays some of the first artifacts excavated by the archaeology team from Georgia Southern University. Georgia Southern&#x27;s Sociology/Anthropology Department has been conducting surveys and excavations for a number of years at the park, serving as a partner in revealing and interpreting the history of Camp Lawton. In the summer of 2015, the park is opening a splash pad to ultimately take the place of the aging and underused swimming pool.

The nearby Bo Ginn Aquarium and Fish Hatchery has been closed since 2010 after a short period of operation by the Jenkins County Development Authority, but it had also been closed twice before by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (1997) and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (2007).

== History ==

Camp Lawton was established during the Civil War in the fall of 1864 by the Confederate Army to confine Union prisoners of war. The Magnolia Springs site was selected to take advantage of the abundant water supply. Built by slave labor and a group of Union prisoners of pine timber harvested on site, the walls measured 12 to high. The stockade began receiving the first of at least 10,299 prisoners in early October. The post was abandoned by the end of November when threatened by Sherman&#x27;s drive on Savannah.

Research using ground-penetrating radar conducted in December 2009 by the LAMAR Institute, Savannah, Georgia () revealed a possible location for the southwest corner of the prison stockade. In 2010 Georgia Southern University undertook archaeological investigations to &quot;ground truth&quot; the results of the radar survey. In August of that year several Georgia Southern archaeology students uncovered the stockade and around 200 Civil War artifacts. The students had used watercolors by an imprisoned private to locate the site.

<text>Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), or the white sifaka, is a medium-sized primate in one of the lemur families, the Indriidae. Critically Endangered, it lives in Madagascar and can be found in a variety of habitats from rainforest to dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar and the spiny thickets of the south. Its fur is thick and silky and generally white with brown on the sides, top of the head, and on the arms. Like all sifakas, it has a long tail that it uses as a balance when leaping from tree to tree. However, its body is so highly adapted to an arboreal existence, on the ground its only means of locomotion is hopping. The species lives in small troops which forage for food.

Despite shrinking habitats, &quot;P. verreauxi&quot; still likely has the largest distribution of all sifakas.

==Anatomy==

In adulthood, the full head and body length is between . The tail of a fully grown Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka grows to be between long. In weight, adult females reach on average, and adult males .

Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka has a relatively low, flat braincase. The face is broader than that of most other indriids, but its snout is reduced. This species of sifaka is also distinguished by its unique dentition. Its dental formula is . The upper incisors are very small and are slightly angled inward towards the gap between I1 and I2. In the mandible, Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka displays the strepsirhine characteristic: the toothcomb. Formed by the procumbent lower incisor and canine, the toothcomb projects past the front margin of the mouth. &quot;P. verreauxi&quot; also presents the high, shearing molar crests of a folivore, helping to shread the leaves, fruit and flowers that it eats.

Postcranially, Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka has a low intermembral index that ranges from 63-66. It has a broader ribcage than most other prosimians, and has many lumbar vertebrae lending it considerable flexibility. The pelvis is high and narrow and the acetabulum is relatively shallow, also allowing for greater flexibility. Like other indriids, &quot;P. verreauxi&quot; has a short calcaneus, pointed nails, and slightly webbed hands and feet.

==Diet==
Verreaux&#x27;s sifakas forage for food with their troop, primarily in the morning and late afternoon, so they can rest during the hottest part of the day. They are herbivores; leaves, fruit, bark and flowers are typical components of the diet. However, they are mostly folivorous (leaves represent the majority of the diet over the year, especially in the dry season) and they seem to choose food items based on quality (lower tannin content) rather than on availability.

==Behaviour==

Verreaux&#x27;s sifakas are diurnal and arboreal, and engage in sunbathing with outstretched arms and legs. They move through the trees by clinging and leaping between vertical supports. They are capable of making remarkable leaps through the trees - distances of 9–10 m are not uncommon. On the ground, they hop bipedally.
They live in family groups, or troops, of 2-12, which may consist of one male and female, or many males and females together. Group and population sex ratio can be more or less skewed toward males. Many groups seem to be effectively harem groups with a single dominant male unrelated with resident female(s). They have a home range of 2.8 to 5.0 ha, and although they are territorial, they defend food sources rather than territorial boundaries, as often boundaries overlap. Females are dominant over males, forming a matriarchal society.

Females use anogenital secretion mainly for territory demarcation whereas males seem to use specialized secretions (via anogenital and throat glands) more for sexual &quot;advertisement&quot; than for territorial purposes. Males show bimorphism, by showing either a clean or stained chest, derived from throat gland secretions and smeared on surfaces by rubbing the upper part of the chest. Stain-chested males engage in the most active marking, and chest staining seems to be related to testosterone levels.

Males and females were found to engage in a biological market, exchanging grooming for grooming during the non-mating period, and grooming (&quot;offered&quot; by males) for reproductive opportunities (sexual access &quot;offered&quot; by females) during the mating period. A study found that females copulate more with stained-chested than with clean-chested males. On the other hand, clean-chested males, with a lower scent-releasing potential, usually offer more grooming to females. This “grooming for sex” tactic allows males with a clean chest to get to copulate with females, even if at low rate.

It has also been discovered that sifaka dyads often engage in post-conflict reunions after aggressive episodes: reconciliation occurs more frequently when food is not involved and for low intensity aggressions. In this species play behavior persists into adulthood where it is used, especially by stranger males during the mating period, as an ice-breaking mechanism to reduce xenophobia.

A study of sifaka vocalizations found that roaring barks are associated with anti-raptor responses in which the Verreaux sifakas looked up and climbed down. On the other hand, the meaning of &quot;tchi-fak&quot; vocalizations and growls varied by population, where a population subject to significant terrestrial predation associated these vocalizations with anti-terrestrial responses in which the sifakas looked down and climbed up, while another population associated the &quot;tchi-fak&quot; with a non-specific flight response, and the growl with mild disturbance.

==Reproduction==
Around 45% of females breed each year when in oestrous between late January and early February. Females give birth to one infant after a gestation period of 130 days, between June and August. For the first 6–8 weeks, the infant clings to the mother&#x27;s stomach, but for the following 19 weeks, it clings to her back. About 30% of infants are lost to predation by the Fossa (&quot;Cryptoprocta ferox&quot;) and a smaller number to raptors like the Madagascar harrier-hawk (&quot;Polyboroides radiatus&quot;). Those that do survive reach sexual maturity between 3–5 years. 

Males generally leave the group to join a neighboring group while adult females tend to stay with their natal group. The testicles of those who become dominant increase when other males are around, increasing their chances of reproducing.

==Ecology and conservation status==
The species is listed in CITES Appendix I, and its IUCN conservation status was updated to Critically Endangered in 2020. In the small spiny forest fragments of South Madagascar, sifaka abundance appears to be influenced by the proportion of large trees (diameter at breast height &gt;=5 cm) and by the abundance of the plant species &quot;Allouadia procera&quot;, a key species of the spiny forest habitat. A long-term, large-scale demographic study of the species at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwest Madagascar found that the sifaka population there had a population growth rate of 0.98 (with confidence intervals spanning 1), suggesting that the population was not in danger of imminent extinction. However, both severe droughts and an increased annual variation in rainfall levels can depress the population growth rate.

<text>Quentin George Murray Smythe (6 August 1916 – 22 October 1997) was a South African recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Smythe was born on 6 August 1916, the grandson of the penultimate Prime Minister of Natal, Charles Smythe and was educated at Weston Agricultural College and Estcourt High School.

==Military career==

During the Second World War, he served with the 1st Battalion Royal Natal Carabineers 1st SA Infantry Division, South African Forces in the East Africa Campaign against the Italians before moving to the Western Desert.

===Victoria Cross===

He was 25 years old, and a sergeant when the South African Forces were attacked near Alem Hamza in Libya. During the attack, Smythe realised that there was no officer to command his platoon and took charge himself. Although he had a wound in his forehead, causing much loss of blood, he managed single-handedly to obliterate a machine gun post, taking all the surviving crew prisoner. Then, again single-handedly and armed only with rifle and bayonet, he promptly did the same with an enemy anti-tank gun crew, after which he consolidated the position. However, because of the deterioration of the situation elsewhere, he found himself ordered to withdraw.

He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery, the citation was gazetted on 11 September 1942:


==Later life==

He married Dale Griffiths, in 1945 (dissolved 1970); they had three sons and one daughter. He married Margaret Joan Shatwell in 1970; she died in 1980. He married his third wife, Patricia Stamper, in 1984.

He later achieved the rank of captain and after the war served with the South African Ministry of Defence. On leaving the Department of Defence, he returned to farming in the Richmond area of Natal. He was an outstanding marksman, a passionate conservationist and animal lover.

He died from cancer in Parklands Hospital Durban, South Africa in October 1997.

==The medal==
Auctioned in UK 1998, the medal is now part of the Lord Ashcroft Collection at the Imperial War Museum in London.

<doc id="1206659" wikidata="Q150327" url="?curid=1206659" title="Danny Ferry">
<text>Daniel John Willard Ferry (born October 17, 1966) is an American executive and former professional basketball player who played the forward position.

Considered one of the most celebrated basketball players in the United States from the high school graduating class of 1985, Ferry chose to attend Duke University. Ferry led the Duke Blue Devils to three Final Four appearances while setting many school records and earning several national player of the year awards. In 2002, Ferry was named to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team honoring the fifty greatest players in conference history.

Drafted into the NBA in 1989 as the second overall pick, Ferry played one season for Italian league&#x27;s Il Messaggero (now Virtus Roma) after refusing to play for the Los Angeles Clippers. He went on to spend the majority of his career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he played from 1990 to 2000. In the NBA, Ferry was a role player known for his three-point shooting. Ferry finished his playing career with the San Antonio Spurs, winning an NBA championship in the 2002–03 season before retiring.

After Ferry&#x27;s playing career ended, he became an executive. Ferry has served as vice president of basketball operations for the San Antonio Spurs and as general manager of the Atlanta Hawks and the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was hired as a consultant to the Spurs in 2020.

==Early life and family==
Ferry was born in Hyattsville, Maryland to former NBA center and NBA executive Bob Ferry and his wife, Rita Ferry. Ferry is of Irish descent; his great-great-grandfather, Peter Ferry, was born in Ireland in 1828 and emigrated to St. Louis, Missouri. The younger Ferry began his basketball career in earnest at DeMatha Catholic High School in Maryland where he excelled at the high school level under Morgan Wootten. The two-time All-American was ranked as one of the country&#x27;s top high school basketball centers while at DeMatha and earned Parade Magazine&#x27;s prep Player of the Year in 1985. Ferry was one of the most highly recruited high school seniors in the nation before committing to Duke University.

Ferry and his wife, Tiffany, have five children.

==College career==

Ferry attended Duke University and played basketball for the school over four seasons from 1985 to 1989. During his college career, he helped lead the Blue Devils to the Final Four in 1986, 1988 and 1989, twice winning the MVP award for the East Regional. Known for his outside shooting, rebounding abilities, and full-court vision, Ferry was selected to the first team All-America in 1989 and second-team All-America in 1988. As of 2024, Ferry still held Duke&#x27;s all-time single game scoring record, having scored 58 points against Miami on December 10, 1988. He has been described as one of Duke&#x27;s greatest players of all time. Ferry became the first player in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) history to collect more than 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds and 500 assists in his collegiate career. He left Duke with several national player of the year awards under his belt, including the Naismith College Player of the Year, USBWA College Player of the Year (Oscar Robertson Trophy) and the UPI player of the year awards. Ferry&#x27;s number 35 was retired in 1989 at the end of his senior season. In 2002, Ferry was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team honoring the fifty greatest players in ACC history.

==Professional career==
===Italy===
After college, Ferry was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round (second overall pick) of the 1989 NBA draft. He did not want to play with the Clippers; instead, he accepted an offer to play for the Italian league&#x27;s Il Messaggero (now Virtus Roma). Ferry averaged 23 points per game during the 1989–90 season, leading the Italian club into the playoffs. The Clippers traded Ferry&#x27;s rights on November 16, 1989, along with Reggie Williams, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for guard Ron Harper, two first-round draft picks and a second-round pick.

===Cleveland Cavaliers===
In the summer of 1990, the Cavaliers signed Ferry to a 10-year guaranteed contract for $34 million. Ferry struggled with knee problems in the 1990–91 season. He never lived up to the expectations created by his collegiate success and his large contract, and he was considered a draft bust. While Ferry became a reliable role player in the NBA who was known for his three-point shooting, he did not become a regular starter for the Cavaliers until 1996. In the 1995–96 NBA season, Ferry averaged 13.3 points per game. He had only one other season in his career (1996–1997) in which he averaged more than 10 points per game. During Ferry&#x27;s 10 years in Cleveland, the team made the NBA playoffs six times. Ferry became the team&#x27;s all-time leader in games played (723 games) before Žydrūnas Ilgauskas surpassed his record on December 2, 2009.

===San Antonio Spurs===
Ferry signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs as a free agent on August 10, 2000. Ferry played for San Antonio for three seasons, amassing a three-point field goal percentage of 42.5%. He won an NBA championship with the Spurs in the 2002–03 season before being traded to the Indiana Pacers in a three-team trade involving the Sacramento Kings. Ferry was waived by the Pacers and he retired in 2003 with a career average of 7.0 points per game. Over the course of his career, Ferry shot 39.3% from three-point range.

==Management career==
From 2003 to 2005, Ferry worked in the Spurs&#x27; front office.

On June 27, 2005, Ferry became the Cavaliers&#x27; eighth general manager. Ferry began his management tenure with the Cavaliers overseeing a series of less-than-optimal transactions. Nonetheless, the team flourished with superstar LeBron James and newly installed head coach Mike Brown at the helm as the team made a series of serious postseason runs beginning in 2006. Ferry, Brown, and Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert began to add talent and depth to the Cavs&#x27; roster, notably acquiring one-time All-Star guard Mo Williams, former All-Star center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, starting shooting guard Anthony Parker, forward Leon Powe, and former All-Star Antawn Jamison between 2008 and 2010. The Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals for the first time in 2007.

On June 4, 2010, it was announced that Ferry and the Cavaliers had come to a mutual agreement to part ways. The Cavaliers went 272–138 during Ferry&#x27;s tenure. In August 2010, Ferry returned to the Spurs as vice president of basketball operations.

On June 25, 2012, Ferry accepted a position as president of basketball operations and general manager for the Atlanta Hawks. In June 2014, Ferry read aloud verbatim an &quot;offensive and racist comment&quot; written in a scouting report during a conference call about Miami Heat player Luol Deng. Hawks co-owner Michael Gearon Jr. called for him to resign or be dismissed. On September 9, Hawks CEO Steve Koonin announced that the team had decided not to dismiss Ferry and that they were instead going to discipline him. A few days later, Ferry asked to take—and was approved for—an immediate, indefinite leave of absence. In June 2015, an independent investigation reported that Ferry&#x27;s actions were not motivated by racism. According to UPI, &quot;[the] investigation, which included 19 witness interviews and reviewed the contents of more than 24,000 emails, made clear that the offensive language was not Ferry&#x27;s and none of Ferry&#x27;s remarks or behavior during the call were motivated by racial or ethnic animus, or by a person&#x27;s country of origin. To the contrary, the investigation found Ferry shared his own opinion of Deng, recommended him both personally and professionally and ultimately tried to sign him to the team.&quot; Following the release of the investigation results, Ferry reached a buyout agreement with the Hawks.

Ferry became a special advisor to the general manager of the New Orleans Pelicans in June 2016. After the firing of general manager Dell Demps on February 15, 2019, Ferry was named the team&#x27;s interim general manager. He held that role for the rest of the season before being removed from his position on April 17 with the hiring of David Griffin as Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations.

Ferry was hired as a consultant to the Spurs in 2020.

<text>The Walthamstow Pumphouse Museum is a museum based in Walthamstow, in the London Borough of Waltham Forest. It is based in and around Low Hall Pumping Station, a Grade II listed building, originally built as a sewage pumping station in 1885.
The museum focuses on the pioneering breakthroughs in road, rail, air and sea transport, that occurred in Waltham Forest and the surrounding area. These achievements include the first British motorcar and the first all British aircraft, which first flew from Walthamstow Marshes.

The museum displays various artifacts, including AEC Routemaster buses, a pair of Marshall C class steam engines, and various fire fighting vehicles.

Also included in the museum&#x27;s collection is a decommissioned London Underground 1967 Stock Victoria line carriage that is frequently used as a film set, concert venue for Underground Lunchtime Recitals and as a supper club three nights per week.

<doc id="1206671" wikidata="Q3520552" url="?curid=1206671" title="The Deep End, Volume 1">
<text>The Deep End, Volume 1 is the fourth studio album by American rock band Gov&#x27;t Mule. It was released on October 23, 2001, by ATO Records and Evangeline Records.

After the death of founding member and bass guitarist Allen Woody, the band considered breaking up. Instead, remaining members Warren Haynes and Matt Abts recorded several songs with bass players Woody had admired. So many musicians wanted to participate that the band ended up recording two albums worth of material. Woody himself is posthumously featured on a cover of Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Sin&#x27;s a Good Man&#x27;s Brother&quot;.

&quot;Volume 1&quot; was issued in 2001. Originally, &quot;The Deep End, Volume 1&quot; was released with a bonus disc called &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; which featured live performances by the &quot;New School of Gov&#x27;t Mule&quot; (Haynes, Abts, bassist Dave Schools, and keyboardist Chuck Leavell).

&quot;The Deep End, Volume 2&quot; was released a year later, featuring a somewhat heavier sound.

&quot;Sco-Mule&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2003.

<text>Quiver is a 1997 first-person shooter video game developed and published by ESD Games. The game revolves around the player infiltrating alien bases with an arsenal of weapons to recover time-traveling orbs. The game was intentionally designed as a clone of the first-person shooter &quot;Doom&quot; (1993) and was geared toward inexpensive computers. It was released as shareware for the MS-DOS to mixed reviews.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Quiver&quot; is a first-person shooter video game. The premise of &quot;Quiver&quot; is that aliens have stolen orbs that can travel back in time, and the player&#x27;s mission is to infiltrate their bases and recover the orbs. The game has 27 levels divided across three episodes, with the goal of each level being to traverse a base and retrieve three orbs. Along the way, the player must fight projectile-shooting enemies with an arsenal of weapons, which include the Spiker, which shoots spiked balls; the Fajita Maker, which shoots three fireballs; the Shredder, which lobs sticky grenades; the Alien Hell Hands, which shoots projectiles around the player; and the Medusa Sphere, which reflects incoming projectiles back to the player&#x27;s enemies.

==Development==
The game was developed by ESD Games, a company based in Tampa, Florida. The game was designed by Mike Taylor on an &quot;archaic 486DX33 system with an ancient 512K VLB (VESA Local Bus) VGA card&quot; as a clone of the first-person shooter &quot;Doom&quot; that could run smoothly on inexpensive computers while being fun. The graphics are less violent than most other first-person shooters. &quot;Quiver&quot; was released in March 1997 for the MS-DOS as shareware, with the first episode serving as a demo and the rest of the game being unlocked upon inputting a registration code.

==Reception==
According to ESD Games, &quot;Quiver&quot; was downloaded 500,000 times. Reviews of &quot;Quiver&quot; have been mixed. In a March 1997 review, &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; found the game fun and fast-paced and the weapons to be creative. A month later, &quot;Games Domain&quot; wrote of the gameplay being decent and fun, but criticized the game&#x27;s lack of key functions such as a multiplayer mode. In September 1997, &quot;PC Player&quot; found &quot;Quiver&quot; outdated, finding fault with its game engine and controls. In a May 2017 retrospective review by &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;, &quot;Quiver&quot; was assessed, across its gameplay and technicals, as unremarkable and dull.

<text>Douglas Alexander Spalding (14 July 1841 – 1877) was a British biologist who studied animal behaviour and worked in the home of Viscount Amberley.

== Biography ==
Spalding was born in Islington in London in 1841, the only son of Jessey Fraser and Alexander Mitchell Spalding, office clerk. Not long after his birth, his parents moved to Aberdeenshire, Scotland where they had previously lived. While working as a slater in Aberdeen, the philosopher Alexander Bain persuaded the University of Aberdeen to allow him to attend courses without charge. He studied philosophy and literature, and after a year left for London. He trained as a lawyer. But when he contracted tuberculosis, he travelled in Europe in hopes of finding a cure, and in Avignon met John Stuart Mill and through him Viscount Amberley (son of the former British prime minister Lord John Russell, by then 1st Earl Russell). He became tutor to Viscount Amberley&#x27;s children at Cleddon Hall, Monmouthshire, including perhaps the young Bertrand Russell, and also carried on an intermittent affair with Viscountess Amberley. After the Lord Amberley&#x27;s death in 1876, Spalding returned to the continent and remained there until his death the following year.

Spalding carried out some experiments on animal behaviour, and discovered the phenomenon now known as imprinting, later rediscovered by Oskar Heinroth, then studied at length and popularised by Konrad Lorenz. He was greatly ahead of his time in his recognition of the importance of the interaction between learning and instinct in determining behaviour, and in his use of the experimental method in studying behaviour. Although his work is little known nowadays, its importance is recognised by historians of psychology; the biologist J. B. S. Haldane reprinted Spalding&#x27;s essay &quot;On Instinct&quot; in 1954 to clarify the history of the subject.

He was first to identify, in 1873, the process which is now known as the Baldwin effect.

<doc id="1206694" wikidata="Q4755023" url="?curid=1206694" title="Andrea Coote">
<text>Andrea Coote (born 18 July 1951) is an Australian former parliamentarian. She was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1999 to 2014, representing Monash Province until the 2006 election and the Southern Metropolitan Region thereafter.

Coote was born in Melbourne, and studied at Fintona Girls&#x27; School and the University of Melbourne. Before being elected to parliament, she worked in a number of business and executive positions, which included stints as Executive Director of the State Library Foundation (1994–1996) and Director of Development at Geelong Grammar School (1996–1998). In the early 1990s, she also worked as a staff officer to Member of the Legislative Assembly Michael John, and later as a ministerial adviser.

Coote succeeded in winning Liberal pre-selection for the safe Liberal-held seat of Monash Province in the leadup to the 1999 election, and was ultimately elected. Jeff Kennett&#x27;s Liberal government, however, had suffered a surprise defeat, so Coote found herself in opposition. Despite this, due to the way the Legislative Council is elected, the Liberal Party still had control of the upper house, giving them significant power to reject legislation introduced by the new Labor government. In her first term in office, Coote was a member of the Legislative Council Printing Committee, and in 2000, also gained a seat on the Economic Development Committee.

During her first term, Coote also became notable for her support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. Coote became one of a small group of Liberal Legislative Councillors - along with Andrew Olexander (since expelled from the parliamentary Liberal Party following a drink-driving incident), and before they lost their seats at the 2002 election, Peter Katsambanis and Leonie Burke - that lobbied for gay-friendly changes in party policy. Along with these three, Coote regularly met with representatives from the LGBT communities in Melbourne. The Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby specifically singled out Coote for praise, describing her as &quot;very proactive on gay issues&quot;. The influence of Coote and her allies was most clearly illustrated when the Liberal Party backed down on its prior opposition to the 2001 &quot;Statute Law Further Amendment (Relationships) Bill&quot;, which Coote spoke in support of. The passage of the bill resulted in major changes, requiring that lesbian and gay relationships be treated equally in fields such as property, superannuation, and medication decision-making.

The 2002 election was devastating for the Liberal Party, resulting in the loss of their control of the Legislative Council, and with Katsambanis and Burke being among those losing their seats. However, this opened up a number of new shadow ministerial positions, and Coote was one of those promoted. She became Shadow Minister for Tourism, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, Manager of the Opposition Business in the Council and Shadow Minister for Ageing and Carers. She also received the additional portfolio of Victorian Communities in January 2004.

Coote was re-elected in 2006 to the Southern Metropolitan Region. In 2006, she was appointed Shadow Minister for the Portfolios of Community Services, Children and Aboriginal Affairs. She is also the Manager of Opposition Business in the Legislative Council, and is a member of the Legislation Committee of the Legislative Council. In 2007 she was reelected as Deputy Leader of the Legislative Council for the Opposition. But after continuous disagreements with Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu both Phillip Davis and Andrea Coote resigned from their Leadership and Shadow Cabinet positions in favour of returning to the backbench of the Legislative Council. After the election of the Baillieu Liberal Government in 2010, Coote was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Families and Community Services, assisting Mary Wooldrige in the first Baillieu Ministry.

Coote was not nominated for the election held on 29 November 2014 choosing to retire from parliament.

<text>Kleinhans Music Hall is a concert venue located on Symphony Circle in Buffalo, New York. The hall &quot;is renowned for its acoustical excellence and graceful architecture.&quot; Kleinhans is currently the home of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, a regular venue for the Buffalo Chamber Music Society, and is rented out for other performing groups and local events. The building was designed by father-and-son team Eliel Saarinen and Eero Saarinen, with help from local architects F. J. and W. A. Kidd, Stanley McCandless as lighting consultant, and Charles C. Potwin as acoustical adviser. Kleinhans has two performance spaces, as well as additional rooms for rehearsals or private events. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989 for its architecture, 49 years after its completion.

== Performance spaces ==
Kleinhans Music Hall offers two spaces for performances, the main auditorium and the Mary Seaton Room. The main auditorium seats 2,441 (it originally accommodated 2839 seats but underwent renovations in 2015 reducing the capacity), and showcases the hall&#x27;s parabolic ceiling and acoustically-informed design. The shape of the hall is such that audience members in the back rows of the balcony will have as clear and instantaneous of an auditory experience as the people in the front rows of the ground level. Charles C. Potwin employed a 1:1.3 ratio in the design of the auditorium to achieve the most ideal acoustic. While the design of the main auditorium is less conducive to reverberation, it aims to create a more intimate experience by drawing the audience in. The austere color palette and simple lines seen in the layout also serve to direct the audience to the music without distraction of ornate decoration.

The Mary Seaton Room is the smaller of the two performance venues, seating up to 700 for a concert, and is well suited for chamber ensembles.

==History==
Kleinhans Music Hall was named by Edward L. Kleinhans in honor of his wife, Mary Seaton Kleinhans, and his mother, Mary Livingston Kleinhans. The Kleinhans family owned a successful men&#x27;s clothing company in Buffalo at the turn of the 20th century. Upon their deaths, three months apart in 1934, they left their entire estate of around $1 million to the Community Foundation for Greater Buffalo with the request that the funds go to the development of a music hall.

Upon its completion in 1940, the cost of construction reached $1.5 million, and included funds from President Roosevelt&#x27;s Public Works Administration in addition to the $1 million from the Kleinhans estate. Kleinhans Music Hall opened on October 12, 1940 with an inaugural concert by the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra under Maestro Franco Autori.

In 2015, the seats of the auditorium were updated, and storage rooms were converted into an archive room to serve as an educational feature of the building&#x27;s philanthropic history and architectural significance.

===Notable events===
On September 8, 1964, Robert F. Kennedy, who at the time was the Democratic candidate to become a United States Senator from New York, gave a speech at Kleinhans in front of a crowd of 6,000 people.

On November 9, 1967, four months after the city was rocked by the Buffalo riot, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech at Kleinhans titled &quot;The Future of Integration.&quot; In this speech, he proclaimed, &quot;We are moving toward the day when we will judge a man by his character and ability instead of by the color of his skin.&quot;

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; is an American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening for Fox. It is a satirical depiction of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society, and television, as well as many aspects of the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of the Fox series &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime-time show that was an early hit for Fox.

Throughout the years, many episodes of the show have been released on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD set in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. The first twenty seasons are available on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4, with the twentieth season released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series. But, only the first seventeen seasons were released in Region 3. &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and was later available on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide on December 3, 2007 and on December 18, 2007 in the U.S. 

On April 8, 2015, show runner Al Jean announced that there would be no more DVD or Blu-ray releases, shifting focus to digital distribution. Two years later, following fan protest, season 18 was released on December 5, 2017 on DVD with the possibility of further seasons if sales were strong enough. Two years later, season 19 was released on DVD on December 3, 2019. Also on December 3, 2019, a limited-edition DVD collection consisting of seasons 1-20, limited to 1,000 units, was released.

<text>The Vympel R-73 (NATO reporting name AA-11 &quot;Archer&quot;) is a short-range air-to-air missile developed by Vympel NPO that entered service in 1984.

==Development==
The R-73 was developed to replace the earlier R-60 (AA-8 &#x27;Aphid&#x27;) weapon for short-range use by Soviet fighter aircraft. Work began in 1973 initially as the K-73, operational in 1982 and the first missiles formally entered service in 1984.

The R-73 is an infrared homing (heat-seeking) missile with a sensitive, cryogenic cooled seeker with a substantial &quot;off-boresight&quot; capability: the seeker can detect targets up to 40° off the missile&#x27;s centerline. It can be targeted by a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) allowing pilots to designate targets by looking at them. Minimum engagement range is about 300 meters, with maximum aerodynamic range of nearly at altitude. The weapon is used by the MiG-29, MiG-31, Su-27/33, Su-34 and Su-35, and can be carried by newer versions of the MiG-21, MiG-23, Sukhoi Su-24, and Su-25 aircraft.

Shortly after German reunification in 1990, Germany and other ex-Warsaw Pact countries found themselves with large stockpiles of the R-73 missiles or &quot;AA-11 Archers&quot; as designated by NATO, and had concluded that the R-73/AA-11&#x27;s capabilities had been noticeably underestimated by the West. In particular, the R-73 was found to be both far more maneuverable, and far more capable in terms of seeker acquisition and tracking than the latest AIM-9 Sidewinder. This realization started the development of newer missiles to help compete, including the ASRAAM, IRIS-T and AIM-9X.

According to an interview in 2022 with a Ukrainian pilot, the R-73 does not track well in clouds. This makes the missile difficult to use against Shahed-136 drones, forcing pilots to rely on their 30 mm cannon.

From 1994, the R-73 has been upgraded in production to the R-73M standard, which entered Russian service in 1997. The R-73M has greater range and a wider seeker angle (to 60° off-boresight), as well as improved IRCCM (Infrared Counter-Counter-Measures). Further developments include the R-74 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; 740) and its export variant RVV-MD. These are expected to supplement previous variants of the R-73 in service.

An improved version of the R-74, the R-74M (&quot;izdeliye&quot; 750) features fully digital and re-programmable systems, and is intended for use on the MiG-35, MiG-29K/M/M2, Su-27SM, Su-30MK and Su-35S. A further upgrade, known as the R-74M2 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; 760), is intended for the fifth-generation Su-57 aircraft. This missile has an inertial navigation system, a smaller cross-section with the fin span reduced to to fit in internal weapon bays, and is designed to match the performance of the AIM-9X, IRIS-T and the ASRAAM. The R-74M2 completed trials in 2019, and its export variant RVV-MD2 was unveiled in 2023. A clean sheet design, the K-MD (&quot;izdeliye&quot; 300), is expected to supersede the R-74M2 in the future.

==Operational history==
On 24 February 1996, two Cessna 337s of the Brothers to the Rescue were shot down while flying over international waters 10 nautical miles outside of Cuban airspace by a Cuban Air Force MiG-29UB. Each of the aircraft was downed by an R-73 missile.

During the Eritrean-Ethiopian War from May 1998 to June 2000, R-73 missiles were used in combat by both Ethiopian Su-27s and Eritrean MiG-29s. It was the IR-homing R-60 and the R-73 that were used in all but two of the kills.

On 18 March 2008, a MiG-29 Fulcrum of the Russian Air Force intercepted a Georgian Elbit Hermes 450 UAV over Abkhazia. The MiG-29 destroyed the UAV with an R-73 missile.

On 27 February 2019, Indian officials claims that an IAF MiG-21 Bison had successfully engaged and shot down a Pakistani F-16 with an R-73E missile during the 2019 Jammu and Kashmir airstrikes. Pakistan denied the loss of its aircraft.

On 7 May 2022, Ukrainian Colonel Ihor Bedzai was killed when his Mi-14 helicopter was shot down by a Russian Su-35. It is reported that after missing its first shots using its 30 mm cannon, the Su-35 resorted to launching an R-73, which destroyed the helicopter.

===Use as a surface to air missile===

These missiles have been used as a surface to air missile. In 1999 R-73s were adapted by Serb forces for surface to air missiles. The Houthi movement&#x27;s Missile Research and Development Centre and the Missile Force have tried to fire R-27/R-60/R-73/R-77, from Yemeni Air Force stocks, against Saudi aircraft. The issue for the R-27R and R-77 is the lack of a radar to support their guidance to the target. However the R-27T, R-73 and R-60 are infrared heat seeking missiles. They only require power, liquid nitrogen &quot;to cool the seeker head&quot;, and a pylon to launch the missile. These missiles have been paired with a &quot;US made FLIR Systems ULTRA 8500 turrets&quot;. However the drawback is that these missiles are intended to be fired from one jet fighter against another. So the motors and fuel load are smaller than a purpose-built surface to air missile. Only one near miss has been verified and that was a R-27T fired at Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA.

On 6 May 2024, Russia released footage of a Ka-29 helicopter using gunfire on a Sea Baby naval drone. The drone was armed with a R-73 infrared missile, to defend it from helicopters. One missile had been fired, at a Mi-8 helicopter, but missed before the drone was destroyed by gunfire.
In December 2024, Ukrainian Ground Forces units received modified 9K33 Osas modified to carry and fire R-73 missiles in addition to the original 9M33M3 missiles.

On 31 December 2024, Ukraine released footage of a Magura V5 naval drone firing an R-73 missile and hitting a Russian Mi-8 helicopter. According to the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the Mi-8 was shot down, while a second helicopter was damaged but managed to return to base.

<text>Mistletoe State Park is a 1,972 acre (7.98 km2) Georgia state park located northwest of Augusta, Georgia on the southern shore of Lake Strom Thurmond. The park gets its name from Mistletoe Corners, a local area where people gather to pick mistletoe during the winter holiday season. Its strategic location on the lake makes it one of the finest bass fishing spots in the nation. The park also offers public beaches and 8 miles of nature trails. The land on which the park is located is leased to Georgia by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

<text>In astronomy, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey), 2dF or 2dFGRS is a redshift survey conducted by the Australian Astronomical Observatory (AAO) with the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1997 and 11 April 2002. The data from this survey were made public on 30 June 2003. The survey determined the large-scale structure in two large slices of the Universe to a depth of around 2.5 billion light years (redshift ~ 0.2). It was the world&#x27;s largest redshift survey between 1998 (overtaking Las Campanas Redshift Survey) and 2003 (overtaken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Matthew Colless, Richard Ellis, Steve Maddox and John Peacock were in charge of the project. Team members Shaun Cole and John Peacock were awarded a share of the 2014 Shaw Prize in astronomy for results from the 2dFGRS.

== Description ==
The 2dF survey covered an area of about 1500 square degrees, surveying regions in both the north and the south galactic poles. The name derives from the fact that the survey instrument has a 2 degree diameter field of view.

The areas selected for observation were previously surveyed by the massive APM Galaxy Survey (on which Steve Maddox also worked). The regions surveyed cover roughly 75 degrees of right ascension for both bands, and the declination of the North Polar band was about 7.5 degrees while the declination of the South Polar band was about 15 degrees. Hundreds of isolated two degree fields near the South Polar band were also surveyed (see this illustration, where black circles represent survey fields, and the red grid represents the earlier APM survey).

In total, the photometry of 382,323 objects were measured, which includes spectra for 245,591 objects, of which 232,155 were galaxies (221,414 with good quality spectra), 12,311 are stars, and 125 are quasi-stellar objects (quasars). The survey necessitated 272 required nights of observation, spread over 5 years.

The survey was carried out with the 4 metre Anglo-Australian Telescope, with the 2dF instrument installed at the primary focus permitting the observation of a field of 2 degrees per pointing. The instrument possesses a spectrograph equipped with two banks each of 200 optical fibres, permitting the simultaneous measurement of 400 spectra.

The limiting apparent magnitude of the survey is 19.5, covering objects with a redshift mostly within less than z=0.3 and a median redshift of 0.11. The volume of the Universe covered by the survey is approximately 108 &quot;h&quot;−1 Mpc3, where &quot;h&quot; corresponds to the value of the Hubble constant, &quot;H&quot;0, divided by 100. &quot;H&quot;0 is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc. The largest redshift observed by the survey corresponds to a distance of 600 &quot;h&quot;−1 Mpc.

== Survey results ==

The principal results obtained for the field of cosmology by the 2dF survey are:

* The measurement of the density parameter of non-relativistic matter (baryonic matter plus dark matter plus massive neutrinos)
* The detection of Baryon acoustic oscillations, and as a consequence the relationship between the density of baryonic matter and dark matter
* Limits on the contribution of massive neutrinos to dark matter, putting a limit on the sum of the masses of the three families of neutrinos at 1.8 eV.

All these results are in agreement with the measurements of other experiments, notably those of WMAP. They confirm the standard cosmological model.

The 2dF survey also yields a unique view on our local cosmic environment. In the figure a 3-D reconstruction of the inner parts of the survey is shown, revealing a view on the cosmic structures in the nearby universe. Several superclusters stand out, such as the Sloan Great Wall, one of the largest structures in the universe known to date (see also Huge-LQG).

<doc id="1206729" wikidata="Q2189348" url="?curid=1206729" title="Oxted">
<text>Oxted is a town and civil parish in the Tandridge district of Surrey, England, at the foot of the North Downs, south-east of Croydon, west of Sevenoaks, and north of East Grinstead.

Oxted is a commuter town and Oxted railway station has direct train services to London. Its main developed area is contiguous with the village of Limpsfield. The headwaters of the River Eden unite in the town, east of Titsey Place. The Eden feeds into Kent&#x27;s longest river, the Medway. Only the southern slope of the North Downs is steep and its towns and farmland form the Vale of Holmesdale, a series of headwaters across Surrey and Kent to separate rivers.

The settlements of Hurst Green and Holland within the civil parish to the south are continuous, and almost wholly residential, areas.

==Toponymy==
The first written mention of Oxted is from an Anglo-Saxon charter of 862 AD, in which it appears as &quot;Acustyde&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the settlement is recorded as &quot;Acstede&quot;. In later documents, it appears as &quot;Akested&quot; (12th century), &quot;Axsted&quot;, &quot;Axstude&quot; and &quot;Ocsted&quot; (13th century) and &quot;Oxsted&quot; (14th century). The name derives from the Old English &quot;āc&quot; meaning &quot;oak&quot; and &quot;stede&quot; meaning &quot;place&quot;. Oxted is generally agreed to mean &quot;place of oak trees&quot;. 

Hurst Green is first recorded in the mid-15th century as &quot;le Herst&quot; in a deed of Edward IV and as &quot;Herste grene&quot; in 1577. The name is thought to mean &quot;open space by the wood (hurst)&quot;. &quot;Holland&quot; appears in 1757 as &quot;Hollands&quot; and is thought to mean &quot;land by the hill&quot;.

==Geography==
===Location and topography===

Oxted is in east Surrey, around south of central London. It is on the Greenwich Meridian, which passes through Oxted School, Station Road East and East Hill (the A25). The town straddles the London to East Grinstead railway line, which runs roughly north–south through the Parish.

The civil parish extends from the North Downs in the north to the settlement of Holland in the south. It includes Old Oxted and Hurst Green, which are to the west and south of the town respectively. Although the urban area of Limpsfield is contiguous with that of Oxted, the village is part of a separate parish. Much of Oxted and the surrounding area is drained by the headwaters of the River Eden, a tributary of the River Medway. The highest point in the civil parish is at Botley Hill, which at above ordnance datum is the highest point on the North Downs.

===Geology===
The oldest outcrops in the area are of Weald Clay, which comes to the surface in the south of the civil parish. A borehole, dug in 1958, indicated that the clay beneath Hurst Green and Holland is deep. Gravels deposited by earlier courses of the River Eden and its tributaries, are found above the clay in the same area. A thin band of Atherfield Clay comes to the surface between Hurst Green and Oxted, north of which are the Sandgate Beds, which overlie the Hythe Beds. The town centre is primarily on the Folkestone Beds, which take the form of a ferruginous quartz-rich sandstone, containing seams of ironstone and mica. To the west of Oxted railway station, there is a thin wash of pebbles, thought to have been deposited by river action during the Pleistocene. To the north of the town, the Chalk of the North Downs has historically been divided into three bands: Lower Chalk, Middle Chalk and Upper Chalk. At Oxted, the middle chalk is around thick.

== History ==
===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human activity in the civil parish is from the Iron Age and finds include a metal brooch dating from the 3rd or 4th centuries BCE. During the Roman period, the roads from London to Lewes and London to Brighton ran either side of Oxted. The name Oxted suggests that the modern settlement was founded in the Anglo-Saxon period and it is possible that St Mary&#x27;s Church is built on a pre-Christian religious site. From late Saxon times, the area was administered as part of the Tandridge Hundred.

===Governance===
Oxted appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Acsted&quot; and was held by Eustace II, Count of Boulogne. Its Domesday assets were: 5 hides; 1 church, 2 mills worth 12s 6d, 20 ploughs, of meadow, pannage worth 100 hogs. It rendered £14 and 2d from a house in Southwark to its feudal overlords per year.

The early medieval manor of Oxted was centred on Oxted Court Farm, to the south of St Mary&#x27;s Church. For much of this period, up until the end of the 13th century, it was held by the de Acstede family, who were mesne lords to the Crown. As the Middle Ages progressed, Oxted was broken up into smaller estates. In around 1246, Broadham manor, thought to have been centred on the present day Broadham Green, to the west of Hurst Green, was granted to Battle Abbey. Records from 1312 and 1408 indicate that Broadham manor covered an area greater than and that the annual rent from the abbey was 51s. Similarly, in 1283, the &quot;Bursted&quot; or &quot;Birsted&quot; estate was granted in perpetuity to Tandridge Priory, but it is unclear where in the parish this land was located.

The last male member of the de Acstede family, Roland de Acstede, was summoned to Parliament in 1290, but he died shortly afterwards. His estate was inherited by his five daughters, each of whom was given a share of the land. By 1300, one part of the manor was held by the sisters Clarica and Alina de Acstede, with the remainder by Hugh de Nevile. In 1342, John de Wellesworth, grandson of Roland, sold the de Acstede portion of the manor to Robert de Stangrave and his wife Joan.

Following the death of Robert de Stangrave in 1344, the former de Acstede portion of the manor of Oxted passed to his wife&#x27;s family, the Cobhams. and in around 1350, John de Nevile, sold the remainder to them. The Cobham family lived at Starborough Castle near Lingfield and their lands in Oxted were run by a resident steward from Oxted Court Farm. In the 15th century, the manor passed to the Burgh family and, in 1587, Charles Hoskins purchased the &quot;manor and advowson of Oxted&quot; which covered some . By the mid-17th century, Barrow Green Court appears to have superseded Oxted Court Farm as the manor house. The Hoskins family held Oxted until the death of Susannah Hoskins in 1868, when it was inherited by her aunt, Katherine Master. She passed the manor to her descendants, the Hoskins Master family.

The civil parish of Oxted was formed in 1894. Oxted was part of the Godstone Rural District from 1894 until 1974, when it was combined with the Caterham and Warlingham Urban District to create the Tandridge District.

===Transport and communications===
The turnpike road from Wrotham Heath to Godstone passed through the town. The modern-day A25 road divides the original town (&quot;Old Oxted&quot;) from &quot;New Oxted&quot;, the development that grew up to the north-east after the railway station opened in 1884. A bypass diverting the A25 to the north of Old Oxted was built in the late 1960s.

The first act of Parliament to authorise the construction of a railway through Oxted was granted in July 1865. It authorised the Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway (S&amp;SJR) to build a line from Croydon to Groombridge, where there was to be a junction with the East Grinstead to Tunbridge Wells line. The act was controversial as the S&amp;SJR was sponsored by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR), but ran into a part of Surrey and East Sussex which was considered South Eastern Railway territory.

In three years, the S&amp;SJR managed to build the Oxted Tunnel and two shorter tunnels at Riddlesdown and Limpsfield. However, construction became increasingly difficult as a result of the 1866 financial panic caused by failure of Overend, Gurney and Company and, in 1869, there was a riot at Edenbridge because Belgian navvies were being employed to build the line. A second act of Parliament was obtained in 1869 to formally transfer line to the LBSCR, who immediately asked for powers to suspend works. The company paid a penalty of £32,250 and construction ceased immediately. No work took place on the unfinished railway line until 1878, when a third act of Parliament authorised the Croydon, Oxted and East Grinstead railway, which would take over construction and be jointly owned by LBSCR and SER. Among the works that were completed by the new company was the iron viaduct between Oxted station and Limpsfield tunnel.

The new line finally opened to passenger traffic in March 1884. Oxted station, originally called Oxted and Limpsfield, was provided with two through platforms and a south-facing bay platform. There was also a freight yard with a south-facing connection to the line. A second station in the parish, Hurst Green Halt opened with line and was replaced by Hurst Green station, to the north, by British Rail in 1961.

The line south from Hurst Green to Eridge was opened in December 1887. A century later, in 1987, Hurst Green Junction signal box closed as part of a resignalling programme for the whole line. Electrification of the line through Oxted to East Grinstead completed July 1987, but the line to Uckfield remains unelectrified.

===Residential development===
Although there is thought to have been a religious building on the site of St Mary&#x27;s Church since before the Norman Conquest, it is unclear whether there was a significant nucleated settlement close to the site. It is possible that much of the population was thinly dispersed throughout the parish until the 12th century.

The settlement of Old Oxted was founded in the 13th and 14th centuries, to the south east of St Mary&#x27;s Church, centred on a crossroads where the Guildford to Canterbury road met Beadle&#x27;s Lane (leading to the south) and Brook Hill (leading to London via the ascent of the North Downs). The street plan does not appear to have changed significantly since medieval times, although the surface of the High Street appears to have been lowered at some stage, most likely to reduce the steepness of the gradient as it approaches the stream at its east end. The oldest buildings in the village, 2-6 Godstone Road and The Old Bell pub, date from the 15th and 16th centuries. Several of the houses are thought to have originated as open hall houses, which have since been modified.

The opening of the railway line through Oxted in 1884, stimulated a rapid of phase of development in the parish. Since the line crossed the Guildford to Canterbury Road on an iron viaduct, it was not practical to build a station at this point. The site chosen for the station was to the northeast of Old Oxted and to the east of St Mary&#x27;s Church.

With the arrival of the railway in 1884 (after many years&#x27; delay caused by lack of funds) Oxted boomed in line with London&#x27;s trade growth around its station, north-east of Old Oxted, and new buildings created &quot;New Oxted&quot;. These new buildings were built in the Tudor style, particularly with stucco frontages. All Saints’ Catholic Church was built in 1913–1928 designed by Arts and Crafts architect James L. Williams (died 1926, his other work includes Royal School of Needlework, St George&#x27;s in Sudbury, London (1926–27) and The Pound House in Totteridge (1907)). The United Reformed Church&#x27;s building followed in 1935, which is listed for its coloured glass and Byzantine design by architect Frederick Lawrence.

Development was supported by Charles Hoskins Master through his Barrow Green Estate selling land parcels for building on what became Chichele Road Circa 1912 and the gifting of Master Park in 1924 for recreation space. Road and place names in Oxted such as Barrow Green Road, Chichele Road (named from their ancestral link to Archbishop of Canterbury Henry Chichele ), The Hoskins ( on the site of the former Hoskins Arms Hotel ), Hoskins Road, Hoskins Walk, and Master Park provide a lasting legacy to the family involvement.

In 2011 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; listed Oxted as the twentieth richest town in Britain. The Daily Mail listed Oxted as one of the 20 best commuter Towns in 2024.

===Oxted in the Second World War===
During the Second World War, the defence of the Oxted and the surrounding area was coordinated by the 9th Surrey Battalion of the Home Guard. In September 1939, the boys of Haberdashers Aske &#x27;s School were evacuated to the town and a public Anderson shelter was constructed on Master Park. Two fighter aircraft, a Hawker Hurricane and a Messerschmitt Bf 109 crashed in the civil parish in August 1940.

==Culture and community==
===Royal British Legion===
1918 The Oxted Branch of Comrades of The Great War was established. A well built 20 ft x 80 ft Army hut costing £377 was opened in July 1919. The hut was sited on the corner of the then recreation ground owned by Mr Charles Hoskins Master, near Court Farm and St Mary&#x27;s Church.The branch was one of about 700 in 30 counties UK wide. An organisation created to inaugurate and maintain in a strong, stimulating, united and democratic comradeship all those who have served in any capacity in the Sea, Land, and Air Forces during the Great War, so that neither their efforts nor their interests shall be forgotten or neglected. May 1921 The British Legion was founded bringing together four similarly minded organisations, creating a unified national voice for ex-servicemen and their families. The Oxted Branch of the Comrades of the Great War became the Oxted Branch of the Royal British Legion. In 1924 the Women&#x27;s Section was formed. 
In December 1926 the Oxted Branch ( Club ) new building overlooking Master Park was opened by Admiral Sir Charles Madden. It cost over £2,200. Designed with a ladies room, a writing room and large games room at the rear, a bar and Stewards accommodation above. The architect was Mr A Douglas Robinson A.R.I.B.A. Mr Granville presented a bookcase for the writing room. The land and building upon which the club is built was officially transferred between Charles Hoskins Master and Francis Morton Thrupp on the 22nd January 1927. The current freehold title SY787642 shows the registered owners as The Royal British Legion, Haig House, 199 Borough High Street, London SE1 1AA.

In 2024 the Legion Club including the Women&#x27;s Section is still going strong. The Oxted Branch of the Royal British Legion, which is a Registered Charity, in part provides social and welfare support activities for ex- military members (Veterans), their families and members of the wider Oxted community.
Within the Branch, the provision of &#x27;welfare&#x27; services to Veterans has been reinvigorated and it now has a growing ‘military’ community, with Veterans from World War Two through to those that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

===Band and civic centre===
Oxted is one of the few Surrey towns to retain a town brass band, Oxted Band, which has been a fixture within the town since 1901. The town became the administrative town of the Tandridge District when it was established in 1974.

===Pram race===
Oxted is host to a charity pram race held annually. It was started in 1977 by Eric and Elsie Hallson, who ran it for nearly 20 years before retiring. Entrants wear fancy dress and must push a pram around the two-thirds of a mile course, stopping at each of the seven licensed premises on the way to quaff a drink as quickly as they can. The race ends in Old Oxted high street where the road is closed for the evening and a street party is held.

The park hosts annual events such as that run by the local football/cricket club. Every year there is also the Oxted Beer Festival.

===Barn Theatre===
The Barn Theatre was conceived as a public hall for the local parishes and was opened on 22 May 1924 by the playwright Harley Granville-Barker. The building, parts of which date from between 1362 and 1433, was originally used as a barn for a sawmill and was moved from Limpsfield to its current site in Blue House Lane. A rehearsal space was constructed to the rear of the theatre in 1931 and a cyclorama was installed in the building in 1968. In 2021, the auditorium has 244 seats. A project to reconfigure the entrance and foyer areas has recently been built in advance of the theatre&#x27;s centenary celebrations in 2024.

== Education ==
St Mary&#x27;s C of E Primary School opened as a National school in Beadles Lane in 1872. Between 1963 and 1974, it moved in stages to its current site in Silkham Road. In 2018, it merged with the adjacent Downs Way School to create a primary school with a total enrolment of 660 pupils.

Hurst Green Infant School opened as a primary school in 1960. In 1993, it became an infants school with a nursery department and since then has educated children aged from two to eight. Holland Junior School opened in 1971 as a middle school. It became a junior school in 1993 and educates pupils aged from eight to eleven.

Oxted School was opened in 1929 and was the first co-educational grammar school in Surrey. Originally called Oxted Secondary School, it opened with 22 pupils, but numbers had grown to 120 by 1932. Following the Second World War, it adopted the name Oxted County School and was renamed to Oxted School in September 1999. In August 1998, a fire destroyed 22 classrooms, the dining hall and the library, but the school reopened for the Autumn Term on time, with many lessons held in temporary buildings. A replacement building, named the Meridian Building, was opened in January 2000. The refurbished arts centre was opened in 2019 by musician Richard Stilgoe as part of the school&#x27;s 90th anniversary celebrations.

Moor House School and College, in Hurst Green, was founded in 1947 by the neurologist Cecil Worster-Drought to educate children with speech and language impairments. Initially it catered for residential students only, but in 2011 it began to admit day pupils and, a year later, a sixth-form centre was opened. The new residential student village was opened by Sophie, Countess of Wessex in October 2016.

==Places of worship==
===St Mary&#x27;s Church===

A church is mentioned in the entry for Oxted in the Domesday Book and St Mary&#x27;s Church is thought to be on the same site. It is around north of Old Oxted and the circular churchyard suggests a pre-conquest origin. The oldest part of the current church is the tower, which is constructed of Bargate stone with brick battlements and which is thought to date from the 12th century. The octagonal stone font and the chancel date from the 13th century. The aisles, built partly from clunch, were added in the 14th century along with the stained glass panels in the east window, depicting the four Evangelists. The building was damaged by fires following lightning strikes in 1637 and in 1719, and the second incident resulted in the destruction of the ring of bells. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, new windows, designed by Edward Burne-Jones and Marjorie Kemp, were installed in the aisles and chancel respectively.

===St John&#x27;s Church, Hurst Green===
The foundation stone of St John&#x27;s Church was laid in July 1912 and was consecrated a year later by the Bishop of Southwark. It was dedicated to John the Evangelist and initially was a daughter church to St Mary&#x27;s. A new parish was created in 1953. It was designed by John Oldrid Scott in the Gothic Revival style and was built on land owned by Uvedale Lambert, who lived at South Park, Bletchingley. Scott is commemorated in the rose window above the altar, which was given by his family in 1914.

On 1 April 1988, an arson attack took place and the resulting fire destroyed much of the interior. During the subsequent rebuilding, the opportunity was taken to remodel the church, and both the rood screen and altar rails were repositioned to make the chancel more accessible from the nave. The new font cover and two mural panels were designed by the artist John Hayward. A carved oak eagle was presented to the church by the Rev&#x27;d Hugh Ford to celebrate its rededication on 1 April 1990.

===All Saints&#x27; Catholic Church===

The first Catholic Mass to be celebrated in Oxted since the Reformation took place in a garden shed in April 1914. Three months later, a plot of land on Chichele Road had been purchased for a new church from the Barrow Green estate. The building was designed by James Leonard Williams in the neo Gothic style and the foundation stone was laid in August 1914. The first mass took place in the completed crypt in October of the same year, but building work ceased for much of the First World War and the shell of the church was not completed until December 1919.

The church bell dates from 1768, but was recast in 1862 and purchased for All Saints&#x27; in 1922. The following year, the stained glass window of St Hedwig, designed by Margaret Agnes Rope was installed in the lady chapel. The church was finally consecrated on 6 July 1927 and the elaborately carved reredos was finished in the same year. The waggon roof, decorated to a design of Geoffrey Fuller Webb, was completed in 1928 and the Stations of the Cross, carved in oak, were installed in 1931. During the Second World War, an incendiary bomb fell on the church, but the fire was extinguished before it could spread to the roof.

===Church of the Peace of God===

The first congregational church in Oxted was opened in Station Road East in 1902. By the early 1930s, it had become unable to cope with the number of worshippers and so a new church, named the Church of the Peace of God, was built in 1934–35. It was designed by Frederick Lawrence in the Byzanitine style and was constructed in red-brown brick. The church has a cruciform plan, oriented north–south, and has a central square tower. The church underwent considerable alteration in 2000, with the addition of an entrance concourse at the front and a new hall at the rear. The sanctuary was also refurbished and the church was rededicated in March 2002.

==Sport==
===Leisure Centre===
Tandridge Leisure Centre was opened in 1990. It was run by the district council until 2000, when management was transferred to a private company, Tandridge Leisure and Culture Trust. Freedom Leisure took over the operation of the centre in May 2018. The centre offers a fitness gym, exercise studio, a 25-metre fitness pool, and a lagoon pool with a flume slide.

===Association football===
Oxted and District Football Club was founded in 1894 and the team have played their home games at Master Park for over a century. Holland Sports F.C. is another football club that is based nearby at Mill Lane, Hurst Green.

===Cricket===
The first recorded cricket match including a team from Oxted took place at Caterham in 1840 and the first known matches in Oxted took place in 1855 and 1857 on Broadham Green. Oxted United Cricket Club was formed and ran until 1893. Oxted and Limpsfield Cricket Club was formed November 1889 and the first matches took place following year on Marls Field, much of which later became Master Park. The pavilion on Master Park was constructed by 1906.

===Field hockey===
Oxted Hockey Club is a field hockey club that competes in the Men&#x27;s England Hockey League and the South East Hockey League.

==Parks and open spaces==

===Great and Little Earls Woods===
Covering a total of , the Great and Little Earls Woods are an area of ancient woodland managed by the Woodland Trust. The sites are designated as ancient semi-natural woodland and the dominant tree species are oak and sweet chestnut.

===Master Park===
The Master Park has been used as an outdoor recreation area since before 1900, although formal permission was only granted by the Hoskins Masters family in 1920. Three years later on the 17th March 1923 11 acres 3 Rods and 22 Perches of land was given to the Parish by Charles Hoskins Master. The land excluded the triangle of land where the Legion and Scout huts stood adjacent Court Farm near St Mary&#x27;s Church. A trust was formed to manage the park and local sports teams began to play matches there. The pavilion dates from 1996 and replaced an earlier building constructed in 1967. In 2024 a new brick built pavilion is under construction. When completed it will feature a modern café, sports changing facilities and versatile community rooms. A red oak tree was planted at the park in 1994, to celebrate the centenary of Oxted Parish Council. The children&#x27;s playground was opened in 2000.

===Mill Lane Playing Fields, Hurst Green===
The Mill Lane Playing Fields are owned by the District Council and leased by the Holland Sports and Social Association. The facilities include an athletics track and various sports pitches. The pavilion provides changing facilities and a licensed bar. The fields have been legally protected by the charity, Fields in Trust, since 1961 and are designated under the King George V Fields scheme.

<text>Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a musical with music and lyrics by Roger Miller, and a book by William Hauptman.

Based on Mark Twain&#x27;s classic 1884 novel, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, it features music in the bluegrass and country styles in keeping with the setting of the novel. The 1985 Broadway production ran for more than 1,000 performances and it remained one of the few very successful American musicals in the mid-1980s among the emerging successes coming from Great Britain. &quot;Big River&quot; won 7 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

==Productions==
The first productions were staged by the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in February 1984 and at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, California, from June through July 1984.

The Broadway production, directed by Des McAnuff and choreographed by Janet Watson, opened on April 25, 1985 at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre, and closed on September 20, 1987, running for 1,005 performances. The cast featured René Auberjonois as The Duke, Bob Gunton as The King, John Goodman as Pap Finn, Daniel H. Jenkins as Huckleberry Finn, Ron Richardson as Jim, with Susan Browning, Gordon Connell as Mark Twain, Patti Cohenour, Jennifer Leigh Warren as Alice&#x27;s Daughter and John Short.
A critically acclaimed revival, directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun, opened on Broadway on July 24, 2003 at the American Airlines Theatre, where it ran for 67 performances and 28 previews. This production, produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company and Deaf West Theatre, was notable in that it featured both deaf and hearing actors performing together. About half the characters, including the leading role of Huck, were played by deaf or hard-of-hearing performers. All dialogue and lyrics in the production were both spoken or sung and signed, making the production equally accessible to hearing and deaf audiences. The character of Mark Twain was expanded, so that the actor (Daniel H. Jenkins, who portrayed the role of Huck in the original Broadway cast) also provided the voice of Huck, portrayed by Tyrone Giordano, who is deaf.

It was remounted for a U.S. tour, which ran from June 11, 2004, to May 31, 2005, and included most of the Broadway cast, and was nominated for several regional awards. A production ran at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington D.C. from March 18 to June 4, 2005.

Goodspeed Musicals staged a production of the musical at the East Haddam, Connecticut theater. The production was directed by Rob Ruggiero and ran from September 26 to November 29, 2008.

The Encores! staged concert opened on February 8, 2017, and ran to February 12, 2017. The production was directed by Lear deBessonet and starred Kyle Scatliffe as Jim, Nicholas Barasch as Huckleberry Finn, Christopher Sieber as the Duke, Lauren Worsham as Mary Jane Wilkes and David Pittu as The King.
===International===
An Australian production starring Cameron Daddo as Huckleberry Finn, Jon English as Pap Finn, John Bell as The Duke and featuring Venetta Fields and Michael Edward Stevens opened in 1989 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney. It also played Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, with Marcia Hines, as well as Festival Theatre in Adelaide.

==Synopsis==

===Act One===

In pre-Civil War Missouri, near St. Petersburg, the vagabond child Huckleberry Finn describes the events by which he and Tom Sawyer had discovered a fortune. Huck has been adopted by the Widow Douglas and her unmarried sister Miss Watson, and his guardians, Judge Thatcher, Huck&#x27;s best friend Tom Sawyer, and practically the entire town inform Huck that he needs to learn to read and write and read the Bible if he ever hopes to go to Heaven (&quot;Do Ya Wanna Go To Heaven?&quot;). The only one who does not attempt to pass judgment on Huck is Miss Watson&#x27;s slave, Jim, who predicts that he will lead a life of &quot;considerable trouble and considerable joy&quot;. Exasperated with the constraints on his daily life, Huck escapes his bedtime and steals away to Tom Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;hideout&quot;, an old cave. In the cave, Tom, Huck and a group of their friends plan to form a band of robbers who will rampage around the countryside (&quot;The Boys&quot;).

Huck, on his way home, thinks about the confines of his life and his wish that he will find meaning in his life. (&quot;Waitin&#x27; For the Light To Shine&quot;) Huck returns home in the darkness to find his Pap, a violent drunk, waiting for him, who drags him off to his cabin in the woods. In his drunkenness, Pap swings from tomfoolery to extreme violence as he rails against a government that would take his son (and his son&#x27;s money) away from him (&quot;Guv&#x27;ment&quot;). Pap attempts to kill Huck, hallucinating that he is the Angel of Death, but passes out in an inebriated mess. The next day Pap goes off to trade and Huck takes the opportunity to escape. He kills a pig and scatters the blood and gore around the cabin in an effort to make it appear as if he&#x27;s been murdered. Huck reflects that this is just the sort of thing Tom Sawyer would do, and Tom appears to sing a vaudeville-style turn about the usefulness of hogs (&quot;Hand For the Hog&quot;).

Huck flees to the nearby Jackson&#x27;s Island, where he, alone, asserts his self-assurance (&quot;I, Huckleberry, Me&quot;). But Huck is not alone; Miss Watson&#x27;s slave, Jim, is there as well. He has run away to avoid being sold down the River to New Orleans. Despite his unease with the concept of abolitionism Huck offers to help Jim reach freedom in the North. A posse is after Jim: with only moments to spare, they find a raft and get it afloat in the mighty Mississippi River (&quot;Muddy Water&quot;).

Jim and Huck travel only at night and don&#x27;t get far from Jackson&#x27;s Island before they are reminded of the seriousness of their actions: a boat carrying runaway slaves back to their masters passes them in the night (&quot;The Crossing&quot;). The days are long as the two forge their way down the river. They pass a flooded house, and a dead man floating in the water that Jim will not let Huck look at. As they sing of the beauty of the River (&quot;River In the Rain&quot;) in a fog, they sail past the mouth of the Ohio — their path to freedom. Soon after, they pick up two drifters who commandeer the small raft as they escape the latest mob on their tail. The con men claim to be a Duke and a King, the long lost heirs to the Duchy of Bridgewater and the French Throne. Huck is intrigued by the delinquent &quot;royals&quot;. The King and the Duke commandeer the raft and plot to sell Jim back into slavery for their own profit, unbeknownst to Huck (&quot;When the Sun Goes Down In the South&quot;).

===Act Two===

Huck, Jim, the Duke, and the King wash ashore in Bricktown, Arkansas, and attempt to fleece the rubes they find. The Duke and King come up with a scheme to make money (&quot;The Royal Nonesuch&quot;), tricking the townspeople. By the end of the evening, Huck can appreciate a new way of life — the three are now several hundred dollars richer. When he returns to the raft, Huck plays a horrible trick on Jim by assuming the guise of a slave hunter. Unamused, Jim rebukes Huck for the first time. After some thought, Huck realizes that Jim, though a slave, is still a human being and deserves an apology (&quot;Worlds Apart&quot;).

The King and Duke reappear to dragoon Huck into their next escapade. While Jim is, again, left alone with the raft, the three encounter a young fool on a dock, singing of his love of his home state (&quot;Arkansas&quot;). Through no fault of his own, he tells the con men everything they need to know about a fortune to be inherited in the Wilkes family, and they crash the funeral as impostors to go about securing their riches (&quot;How Blest We Are&quot;). Huck — through it all a pure soul — sees that the beautiful and innocent Mary Jane Wilkes is being robbed of her rightful inheritance by these &quot;rapscallions&quot;, and steals back her money from the King and the Duke as she mourns her father&#x27;s coffin (&quot;You Oughta Be Here With Me&quot;). He quickly stuffs the gold into her father&#x27;s coffin and hides behind it to avoid notice.

When Mary Jane realizes what Huck has done, she asks that he remain with her and become her friend. For the first time in his life, he is moved by the actions of another (&quot;Leavin&#x27;s Not the Only Way To Go&quot;), yet he realizes that he has made a promise to Jim: one that transcends mere friendship. Huck returns again to the raft and finds the Duke tarred and feathered: he has sold Jim back into slavery for a mere forty dollars. Feeling guilty about what he has done, Huck pens a letter to Miss Watson, telling her where she can find the runaway Jim. After a momentary reprieve, Huck ends up feeling worse than ever. He tears up the letter and resolves to free Jim again, even if it means he will go to Hell (&quot;Waiting For the Light To Shine&quot; (Reprise)).

Huck visits Mr. Phelps, the farmer to whom Jim has been sold, and is shocked to discover that he has been mistaken for Tom Sawyer, the Phelps&#x27; nephew who is expected for a visit. Tom arrives later and is intercepted by Huck before he reaches the farm. Huck explains everything and Tom, delighted by the prospect for a grand adventure, decides to help Huck free Jim from his captors while pretending to be his own brother Sid. They find Jim imprisoned in a tiny cell and work to free him as he laments his desire to be free (&quot;Free At Last&quot;). Progress is slowed by Tom&#x27;s insistence of making sure that the circumstances of the escape match the adventure novels he has read, which includes notifying Phelps of the escape by an anonymous letter. As they free Jim, Tom is shot in the leg. Jim sacrifices his freedom to ensure Tom gets a doctor, and is about to be locked up again when Tom admits that Miss Watson has died, freeing Jim in her will.

Jim decides to continue his trek to the North so that he may buy his family out of slavery, and Huck decides to continue westwards to escape any attempts to &quot;civilize&quot; him. They sit for a moment at the banks of the river, recalling their adventures together (&quot;River In the Rain&quot; (Reprise)). Jim reveals to Huck that the body they saw in the water was the dead body of Huck&#x27;s Pap. Jim leaves Huck alone for the last time, and Huck decides, &quot;It was like the fortune Jim predicted long ago: considerable trouble and considerable joy.&quot; He begins his next journey (&quot;Muddy Water&quot; (Reprise)).

<doc id="1206732" wikidata="Q6990895" url="?curid=1206732" title="Nemadi dialect">
<text>Nemadi is a language spoken by a small hunting tribe of eastern Mauritania known as the Nemadi people. It is, according to some sources, a dialect of Hassaniyya, according to others, a mixture of Zenaga, Azer and Hassaniyya. The name &quot;Nemadi&quot; itself appears to come from Soninke, where it means &quot;master of dogs&quot;.

==Accounts of the language==
According to Robert Arnaud (1906), &quot;around Tichit the Nemadi employ a dialect called Azeïr which is close to Soninke.&quot; Chudeau (1913), perhaps following him, adds that &quot;We have little information on their language, which M. Delafosse classifies provisionally with Soninké.&quot; However, Brosset (1932) says that they speak Hassaniyya, and that &quot;their special vocabulary does not consist of vocables different from Hassaniyya, but of technical terms which need has forced them to create, which are forged from Arabic, Zenaga, and maybe Azer.&quot;

Chinguetti&#x27;s &quot;Kitab El Wasit&quot; says that &quot;The Nmadi speak the dialect common to all the Moors (i.e. Hassaniyya). However, they do not pronounce the final &quot;m&quot; of the affixed second person plural pronoun, so they say: &quot;as-Salam alayku&quot; (&quot;peace be upon you&quot;) for &quot;alaikum&quot;, and &quot;kayfa haluku&quot; (&quot;how are you?&quot;) for &quot;halukum&quot;.&quot;

Laforgue claims that they speak &quot;Zenati&quot;, i.e. Berber, a claim seen by Hermans as &quot;very improbable&quot;.

According to Gerteiny (1967), they speak &quot;their own dialect, probably a mixture of Azêr [Soninke], Zenaga, and Hassaniyya, called &quot;Ikôku&quot; by the Moors. They express themselves in brief idiomatic phrases, and the language has neither singular nor plural.&quot;

The Ethnologue&#x27;s former description of their language appears to be based solely on this source. Later editions say that &quot;The Nemadi (Ikoku) are an ethnic group of 200 (1967) that speak Hassaniyya, but they have special morphemes for dogs, hunting, and houses&quot;.

Hermans&#x27; opinion is that &quot;the language spoken by the Nemadi in general (there may remain some Azer-speaking Nemadi) is Hassaniyya. But one must recognize certain peculiarities&quot;, including the lack of plural, certain argot-like expressions (cf. Fondacci), and the technical terms (cf. Brosset, Fondacci, Gabus.)

The Nemadi feature in a side story in Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s semi-fictional book &quot;The Songlines&quot; about Aboriginal Australians.

He won the Heisman Trophy, Walter Camp Award, and Davey O&#x27;Brien Award in 2001. Running Nebraska&#x27;s option offense that year, he completed 105 of 189 passes for 1,510 yards and seven touchdowns, while also rushing for 1,115 yards and 18 touchdowns. He had brief stints playing professionally in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and United Football League (UFL).

Crouch appeared on the cover of the video game &quot;NCAA College Football 2K3&quot;.

He also is a TV sports analyst and recreational equipment vendor.

==Early life==
Crouch attended Millard North High School in Omaha, Nebraska graduating in 1997. As a senior, Crouch ran for 1,277 yards and 15 touchdowns adding 543 passing yards and 5 touchdowns. Crouch was named Gatorade High School Player of the Year for the state of Nebraska. He finished his high school career with 5,134 yards of total offense.

Crouch also ran Track &amp; Field focusing on the sprints. He placed 2nd and 4th in the State Championships in the 100 meter and 200 meter races, respectively. His 10.4 second 100 meter mark, ranks him tied for 5th all time in Nebraska.

==College career==
Ankle surgery forced Crouch to redshirt for the 1997 co-national championship-winning season. In 1998, Bobby Newcombe began the season as the starting quarterback, but he was sidelined by a knee injury after the first game and Crouch took over the starting duties. Against UAB, Crouch rushed for two touchdowns and completed 11 of 17 passes in his first career start. 1998 proved to be a chaotic season for the Cornhuskers. Crouch made another start before being replaced by a healthy Bobby Newcombe. Newcombe started the next five games, but was pulled in the middle of a game because of a PCL strain. Senior walk-on, Monte Christo, took over for Newcombe, and started the following week against Texas. With Texas leading 10-0 in the middle of the second quarter, Christo was pulled and replaced by Crouch. Crouch remained the starter for the rest of the season, which ended with a 23-20 loss to Arizona in the Holiday Bowl.

The next fall Newcombe was named the starting quarterback, and it was rumored that Crouch might leave the team. Crouch, however, was given significant playing time in the first and second games. He started the third game against Southern Mississippi, and Newcombe moved to wingback. Crouch led Nebraska in a season that saw NU avenge its only loss of the season in a rematch against Texas in the Big 12 Championship Game. The Cornhuskers finished the season with a 12-1 record and ranked No. 3 after defeating Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl.

Crouch started every game in the 2000 season, which ended with a 66-17 trouncing of Northwestern in the Alamo Bowl. Nebraska&#x27;s only losses during the 10-2 season were to eventual national champion, Oklahoma Sooners, and the Kansas State Wildcats.

In 2001 Crouch had his best year, breaking school or NCAA records almost weekly and appearing to be a serious contender for the Heisman Trophy. In the first game of the 2001 season, a 21-7 defeat of TCU, Crouch surpassed Tommie Frazier as Nebraska&#x27;s all-time total offense leader. He became the Big 12 all-time career rushing quarterback in the emotionally charged game against Rice. The next week, against Missouri, Crouch was backed up near the goal line when he scrambled to escape from defenders and pulled off a 95-yard touchdown run, the longest in school history. Against Iowa State the following week, Crouch broke the record for career touchdowns by a quarterback. Crouch became only the fourth player in Division 1 history to both pass and rush for 3,000 yards in a career with his performance against Texas Tech. Next, in a hard-fought game against defending national champion Oklahoma, Crouch again showed off his speed and playmaking abilities, this time serving as quarterback and receiver in a single play, the famous &quot;Black 41 Flash Reverse Pass&quot; in which Crouch made a 63-yard touchdown reception. By mid-November Crouch had set a school record for most career wins as a starter and became only the ninth quarterback in D-1A history to have won 35 games as a starter. The Cornhuskers were 11-0 going into the annual contest with Colorado the day after Thanksgiving. While playing from behind the whole game, Crouch set the school record for offense yards in a single game with 360 yards. The Nebraska defense was dominated by the Buffaloes, however, and gave up a then-record 62 points to Colorado. The 62-36 loss did not end Nebraska&#x27;s hopes of playing for the national championship and Crouch&#x27;s chances of winning the Heisman. Two weeks later, Crouch was announced as the recipient of the award, edging out Florida&#x27;s Rex Grossman and Miami&#x27;s Ken Dorsey in the closest Heisman ballot since 1985. His outstanding season also was recognized when he won the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award for being the best collegiate quarterback in the nation during the 2001 season. In the meantime several highly ranked teams were upset and in the final BCS rankings, Nebraska beat out one-loss Oregon and two-loss Colorado to earn the No. 2 spot in the BCS rankings. The final BCS rankings were steeped in controversy since Nebraska had the chance to play in the Rose Bowl for the national championship despite not winning a conference or division championship. In the Rose Bowl on January 3, 2002, Crouch rushed for 114 yards against the Miami Hurricanes but was denied a touchdown for the first time since September, 1999. The No. 1 Hurricanes defeated the Cornhuskers 37-14, leaving Crouch with a 35-7 record as a starting quarterback.

===College statistics===
==Professional football==
=== NFL and NFL Europe ===
Crouch was initially drafted by the St. Louis Rams of the NFL as a wide receiver, but still wanted to play quarterback. Crouch, however, was seen by NFL teams as being too short to play quarterback. His athleticism was seen as better suited for playing wideout. However, he suffered an injury to his leg that involved a huge buildup of blood that saw him drained twice and months of recovery. Crouch denied that he refused to play wide receiver when it came to leaving the Rams.

Crouch signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in January 2005, and was allocated to the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europe. Crouch converted to the safety position, recording 25 tackles and two passes defended.

===CFL===
Crouch&#x27;s opportunity to play quarterback at the professional level finally came when he signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League on February 15, 2006 as a quarterback. (The Argonauts had owned his CFL rights for several years.) In his inaugural CFL season Crouch eventually became the fourth-string quarterback in Toronto, behind Damon Allen, Michael Bishop, and Spergon Wynn. On July 22, 2006, Crouch made his regular season CFL debut against the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Regina, Saskatchewan. Coming in at the start of the second half following an injury to Wynn, Crouch sealed the win for Toronto with solid play, including a 94-yard pass completion to Arland Bruce III.

In 2007 Crouch was expected to battle Michael Bishop, Damon Allen, Mike McMahon and Tom Arth for the Argos&#x27; starting quarterback position, but he eventually faltered because of injury. He began the season on the nine-week disabled list. After coming off the disabled list, Crouch was released by the Argonauts on September 6, 2007.

===AAFL===
On September 25, 2007, Crouch signed with the upstart All-American Football League. He was drafted 3rd overall by Team Texas on January 26, 2008, in the first round of the league&#x27;s inaugural draft. He was, however, released from his contract (along with all AAFL players) when the league canceled its debut season.

===UFL===
On April 9, 2011, Crouch attended a public workout for the United Football League&#x27;s Omaha Nighthawks. On June 8, 2011, Crouch accepted an invitation to attend the Nighthawks mini-camp. On June 10, 2011, he was added to the Nighthawks official roster. The UFL suspended operations on October 20, 2012.

==Coaching career==
Crouch served as the special teams coordinator and running backs coach at Midland University from 2018 to 2021.

==Post-playing career==
Eric Crouch was a sales territory manager for a major medical device manufacturer in the US. Currently, Crouch is a vendor of playground and recreation equipment at Crouch Recreation in Omaha, Nebraska.

He has been a TV studio analyst for KETV Channel 7 in Omaha, and a studio analyst on Versus. Crouch joined Fox College Football as an In-Game Analyst for FX in 2013.

<text>Sergeant James Somers VC (12 June 1894 – 7 May 1918) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==

Somers was born in Belturbet, County Cavan on 12 June 1894. He was 21 years old, and a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 1/2 July 1915, in Gallipoli, Turkey, when, owing to hostile bombing, some of his troops had retired from a sap, Sergeant Somers remained alone there until a party brought up bombs. He then climbed over into the Turkish trench and bombed the Turks with great effect. Later on, he advanced into the open under heavy fire and held back the enemy by throwing bombs into their flank until a barricade had been established. During this period, he frequently ran to and from his trenches to obtain fresh supplies of bombs.

In a letter to his father, Somers wrote:

:&quot;I beat the Turks out of our trench single-handed and had four awful hours at night. The Turks swarmed in from all roads, but I gave them a rough time of it, still holding the trench. It is certain sure we are beating the Turks all right. In the trench I came out of, it was shocking to see the dead. They lay, about three thousand Turks, in front of our trenches, and the smell was absolutely chronic. You know when the sun has been shining on those bodies for three or four days it makes a horrible smell; a person would not mind if it was possible to bury them. But no, you dare not put your nose outside the trench, and if you did, you would be a dead man.&quot;
He had previously been severely wounded during the Retreat from Mons in August 1914.
Later in the war, Somers served with the Army Service Corps on the Western Front. He died on 7 May 1918 (aged 24) leaving behind his parents, wife and son, and was buried with full military honours in Modreeny Church of Ireland cemetery. His Union Jack-draped coffin was carried on a gun carriage, led by the Pipe Band of the Cameron Highlanders. His headstone states simply:&quot;He stood and defended. The Lord wrought a great wonder.&quot;

<text>Indometacin, also known as indomethacin, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins.

It was patented in 1961 and approved for medical use in 1963. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 256th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
As an NSAID, indometacin is an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Clinical indications for indometacin include:&lt;br&gt;
Joint diseases
*rheumatoid arthritis
*ankylosing spondylitis
*osteoarthritis
*gouty arthritis
*acute painful shoulder bursitis or tendinitis
Headaches
*Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias
*Paroxysmal hemicranias
*Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania
*Episodic paroxysmal hemicrania
*Hemicrania continua
*Valsalva-induced headaches
*Primary cough headache
*Primary exertional headache
*Primary headache associated with sexual activity (preorgasmic and orgasmic)
*Primary stabbing headache (jabs and jolts syndrome)
*Hypnic headache
Others
*Patent ductus arteriosus

==Contraindications==
* Concurrent peptic ulcer, or history of ulcer disease
* Allergy to indometacin, aspirin, or other NSAIDs
* Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and gastric sleeve patients
* Patients with nasal polyps reacting with an angioedema to other NSAIDs
* Children under 2 years of age (with the exception of neonates with patent ductus arteriosus)
* Severe pre-existing renal and liver damage
* Caution: pre-existing bone marrow damage (frequent blood cell counts are indicated)
* Caution: bleeding tendencies of unknown origin (indometacin inhibits platelet aggregation)
* Caution: Parkinson&#x27;s disease, epilepsy, psychotic disorders (indometacin may worsen these conditions) 
* Concurrent with potassium sparing diuretics
* Patients who have a patent ductus arteriosus dependent heart defect (such as transposition of the great vessels)
* Significant hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Concomitant administration of lithium salts (such as lithium carbonate)

==Adverse effects==

In general, the adverse effects of indometacin are similar to those of all other NSAIDs. For instance, indometacin inhibits both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, which then inhibits the production of prostaglandins in the stomach and intestines responsible for maintaining the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Indometacin, therefore, like other non-selective COX inhibitors, can cause peptic ulcers. These ulcers can result in serious bleeding or perforation, requiring hospitalization of the patient.

To reduce the possibility of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50 and 200 mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150 mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.

Many NSAIDs, but particularly indometacin, cause lithium retention by reducing its excretion by the kidneys. Thus indometacin users have an elevated risk of lithium toxicity. For patients taking lithium (e.g. for treatment of depression or bipolar disorder), less toxic NSAIDs such as sulindac or aspirin are preferred.

All NSAIDs, including indometacin, also increase plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, and increase sodium and potassium retention. Vasopressin activity is also enhanced. Together these may lead to:

* Edema (swelling due to fluid retention)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels)
* Hypertension

Elevations of serum creatinine and more serious renal damage such as acute kidney failure, chronic nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and high potassium levels in the blood.

Paradoxically yet uncommonly, indometacin can cause headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson&#x27;s disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including angioedema, sweating, severe hypotension and tachycardia as well as acute bronchospasm), severe or lethal hepatitis and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and photosensitivity are also possible side effects.

The frequency and severity of side effects and the availability of better tolerated alternatives make indometacin today a drug of second choice. Its use in acute gout attacks and in dysmenorrhea is well-established because in these indications the duration of treatment is limited to a few days only, therefore serious side effects are not likely to occur.

People should undergo regular physical examination to detect edema and signs of central nervous side effects. Blood pressure checks will reveal development of hypertension. Periodic serum electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) measurements, complete blood cell counts and assessment of liver enzymes as well as of creatinine (renal function) should be performed. This is particularly important if Indometacin is given together with an ACE inhibitor or with potassium-sparing diuretics, because these combinations can lead to hyperkalemia and/or serious kidney failure. No examinations are necessary if only the topical preparations (spray or gel) are applied.

Rare cases have shown that use of this medication by pregnant women can have an effect on the fetal heart, possibly resulting in fetal death via premature closing of the Ductus arteriosus.

In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

==Mechanism of action==
Indometacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has similar mode of action when compared to other drugs in this group. It is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, the enzymes that participate in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins are hormone-like molecules normally found in the body, where they have a wide variety of effects, some of which lead to pain, fever, and inflammation. By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin can reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. Mechanism of action of indomethacin, along with several other NSAIDs that inhibit COX, was described in 1971.

Additionally, indometacin has recently been found to be a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. By enhancing the binding and signalling of endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide, PAMs may elicit increased cannabinergic signalling in a tissue specific manner, reducing the incidence of problematic side effects such as psychoactivity while maintaining some antinociceptive activity.

Indometacin has a logarithmic p&quot;K&quot;a of 3 to 4.5. Since the physiologic body pH is well above the pKa range of indometacin, most of the indometacin molecules will be dissociated into ionized form, leaving very little un-ionized form of indometacin to cross a cell membrane. If the pH gradient across a cell membrane is high, most of the indometacin molecules will be trapped in one side of the membrane with higher pH. This phenomenon is called &quot;ion trapping&quot;. The phenomenon of ion trapping is particularly prominent in the stomach as pH at the stomach mucosa layer is extremely acidic, while the parietal cells are more alkaline. Therefore, indometacin are trapped inside the parietal cells in ionized form, damaging the stomach cells, causing stomach irritation. This stomach irritation can reduce if the stomach acidity is reduced, as the GI side effects from NSAIDs are generally reduced by decreasing stomach acidity.

Indometacin&#x27;s role in treating certain headaches is unique compared to other NSAIDs. In addition to the class effect of COX inhibition, there is evidence that indometacin has the ability to reduce cerebral blood flow not only through modulation of nitric oxide pathways but also via intracranial precapillary vasoconstriction. The indometacin property of reducing cerebral blood flow is useful in treating raised intracranial pressure. A case report has shown that an intravenous bolus dose of indometacin given with 2 hours of continuous infusion is able to reduce intracranial pressure by 37% in 10 to 15 minutes and increases cerebral perfusion pressure by 30% at the same time. This reduction in cerebral pressure may be responsible for the remarkable efficacy in a group of headaches that is referred to as &quot;indometacin-responsive headaches&quot;, such as idiopathic stabbing headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicranial, and exertional headaches. On the other hand, the activation of superior salivary nucleus in the brainstem is used to stimulate the trigeminal autonomic reflex arc, causing a type of headache called trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. Indometacin inhibits the superior salivatory nucleus, thus relieving this type of headache.

Prostaglandins also cause uterine contractions in pregnant women. Indometacin is an effective tocolytic agent, able to delay premature labor by reducing uterine contractions through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the uterus and possibly through calcium channel blockade.

Indometacin readily crosses the placenta and can reduce fetal urine production to treat polyhydramnios. It does so by reducing renal blood flow and increasing renal vascular resistance, possibly by enhancing the effects of vasopressin on the fetal kidneys.

Other modes of action for indometacin are:
* it inhibits motility of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, similar to colchicine
* it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, like salicylates
* it has been found to specifically inhibit MRP (multidrug resistance proteins) in murine and human cells

<text>Reed Bingham State Park is a 1,613 acre (6.53 km2) Georgia state park in Colquitt County and Cook County located 5 miles east of Ellenton. The park surrounds a 375-acre (1.52 km2) lake that is a tourist attraction in southern Georgia. Inside the park, visitors can hike the 3.5 mile (5.6 km) long Coastal Plains Nature Trail, which goes through a baldcypress swamp, a pitcher plant bog, and sandhill area. The park also contains many animals, including the threatened gopher tortoise and the indigo snake. In addition, the park offers camping and fishing with special ponds for kids that are only open on specific dates. It was named for Amos Reed Bingham who was instrumental in having the park established.

<text>The American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) was a United States–based organization of electrical engineers that existed from 1884 through 1962. On January 1, 1963, it merged with the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

== History ==

The 1884 founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) included some of the most prominent inventors and innovators in the then new field of electrical engineering, among them Nikola Tesla, Thomas Alva Edison, Elihu Thomson, Edwin J. Houston, and Edward Weston. The purpose of the AIEE was stated &quot;to promote the Arts and Sciences connected with the production and utilization of electricity and the welfare of those employed in these Industries: by means of social intercourse, the reading and discussion of professional papers and the circulation by means of publication among members and associates of information thus obtained.&quot; The first president of AIEE was Norvin Green, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Other notable AIEE presidents were Alexander Graham Bell (1891–1892), Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1901–1902), Bion J. Arnold (1903–1904), Schuyler S. Wheeler (1905–1906), Dugald C. Jackson (1910–1911), Ralph D. Mershon (1912–1913), Cyprien O. Mailloux (1913–1914), Michael I. Pupin (1925–1926), and Titus G. LeClair (1950–1951).

The first technical meeting of the AIEE was held during the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 7–8, at the Franklin Institute. After several years of operating primarily in New York City, the AIEE authorized local sections in 1902. These were first formed in the United States in Chicago and Ithaca, New York, in 1902, and then in other countries. The first section outside the United States, established in 1903, was in Toronto, Canada. AIEE&#x27;s regional structure was soon complemented by a technical structure. The first technical committee of AIEE, the High Voltage Transmission Committee, was formed in 1903. Standardization work started in 1891 with the formation of a committee on units and standards, followed by a committee on standard wiring.

The formation of the AIEE Subcommittee on Large-Scale Computing in 1946 was considered a key milestone in the history of computer engineering, representing the first time that a professional association recognized the significance of computers and computing in electro-technology.

The early technical areas of interest of AIEE were electric power, lighting, and wired communications. Radio and wireless communications became the major focus of a rival organization, the Institute of Radio Engineers (the IRE, established 1912). The dynamic growth of radio technology and the emergence of the new discipline of electronics in the 1940s led to stiff competition between AIEE and IRE, with IRE showing faster growth in the 1950s and early 1960s, and attracting more students. In 1957, the IRE, with approximately 55,500 members, surpassed the AIEE in membership size; by 1962 the IRE had 96,500 members to the AIEE&#x27;s 57,000.

== Institute&#x27;s first logo ==
After the AIEE&#x27;s founding in 1884, its member&#x27;s badge was created in 1893 by a committee headed by Alexander Graham Bell, AIEE&#x27;s president from 1891 to 1892. The badge&#x27;s logo depicted Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s kite, representative of the discovery that lightning carried electricity. 

The design also showed a winding of gold wire with its midpoints crossed by a galvanometer&#x27;s indicator, invoking the electrical engineer&#x27;s Wheatstone bridge. Ohm&#x27;s law and the letters &quot;AIEE&quot; were added in gold at the logo&#x27;s base. The busy logo design was replaced four years later.

== Merger and evolution ==
The AIEE and the IRE merged in 1963 to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), in short order becoming the world&#x27;s largest technical society.

<text>The Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra is an American symphony orchestra located in Buffalo, New York led by Music Director JoAnn Falletta. Its primary performing venue is Kleinhans Music Hall, which is a National Historic Landmark. Each season it presents over 120 classical series, pops, rock, youth, and family concerts. During the summer months, the orchestra performs at parks and outdoor venues across Western New York.

==History==

===Creation and early years===
During the late 1920s and early 30s, considerable efforts were made to foster interest in a professional orchestra for the Greater Buffalo community. By late 1934, via the efforts of Cameron Baird, Frederick Slee and Samuel P. Capen, a conductor of extensive European training was recruited to Buffalo in the person of Lajos Shuk, a cellist and director of the New York Civic Symphony. Two buildings which house the music department at the University at Buffalo have been named after Baird and Slee, while the university&#x27;s main administration building is named after Capen. Shortly thereafter, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra Society was formed and a series of classics concerts and the first BPO youth concerts were presented in the 1935–36 season.

Through the leadership of Society President Mrs. Florence B. Wendt, funds were raised to maintain a viable ensemble through 1937 when support was received from the federal WPA project, which sponsored additional players and recruited a conductor named Franco Autori from the Dallas Symphony. Over the next two seasons the orchestra suffered various administrative and financial growing pains. The orchestra also began performing run-out concerts to neighboring localities like Niagara Falls. By the opening of the 1939–40 season, the Society and the Greater Buffalo community were ready to provide support for the expansion of both the classical and lighter &#x27;Pops&#x27; programming by the orchestra.

===Kleinhans Music Hall===

Kleinhans Music Hall was opened in the fall of 1940. Constructed with funds in part bequeathed by Edward L. Kleinhans and Mary Seaton Kleinhans, the Hall has since served as the Orchestra&#x27;s permanent home. Kleinhans Music Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. The hall was designed by Eliel and Eero Saarinen. Though some improvements have been made, there have been little changes since the construction of the hall. The hall has a seating capacity of 2,400.

The BPO dedication concert of Kleinhans in October 1940 allowed the orchestra to grow with additional players, expanded outreach, the regular appearance of major concertizing artists, a series of FM broadcasts, and a diversification of repertoire. Autori resigned in the spring of 1945 and closed his tenure by conducting the Buffalo premiere of Copland&#x27;s Lincoln Portrait with Carl Sandburg as narrator.

===William Steinberg era===
Cameron Baird (the Chairman of the UB Music Department) received a recommendation from Arturo Toscanini of the NBC Symphony that its Associate Conductor, William Steinberg, would be suitable for the job.

The Steinberg era of the BPO had many changes in orchestra personnel, including the beginning of an influx of European musicians who had sought new lives and careers here in the United States just after World War II. Their presence served to define a distinctly European sound that began during the late 40s and continued throughout the 50s and well beyond. The BPO&#x27;s first commercial recording, the Leningrad Symphony No.7 by Shostakovich, was released on the Musicraft label during this period. Several of the Orchestra&#x27;s performances were recorded for broadcast on the NBC radio network, beginning in 1947, and currently preserved in the BPO Archive and at the Library of Congress.

===Krips, Foss, and Art Park===
Steinberg resigned in 1952 to take over the Pittsburgh Symphony. Josef Krips, the former Music Director of the Vienna State Opera and London Symphony Orchestra was then chosen to lead the orchestra. The Krips era witnessed a major expansion in the length of the season and the number of musicians employed as well as the re-initiation of major tours in the eastern United States and Canada, including the Maritime Provinces. 

Krips resigned in 1961 to take over the San Francisco Symphony. Lukas Foss became the new director of BPO.

The Orchestra was invited to Carnegie Hall for the first of regular appearances there. Its first major recordings were made on the Nonesuch label featuring the music of Sibelius, Cage, Penderecki, Xenakis, Ruggles and Foss. BPO&#x27;s first nationwide TV appearances were broadcast on PBS with Stockhousen&#x27;s Momente and Mussorgsky&#x27;s Pictures at an Exhibition, after which followed the initiation of several major tours, including two national tours with Arthur Fiedler and his &#x27;Pops&#x27; repertoire. Buffalo and the BPO received feature coverage in Life Magazine. In 1970 maestro Foss shared the dais with Governor Nelson Rockefeller at the groundbreaking of Artpark, the permanent summer home of the BPO.

===1971 – Present===
When Foss resigned to take on the Jerusalem Symphony in 1971, he was followed Michael Tilson Thomas. Over the next several seasons with Thomas, the Orchestra made two Columbia recordings and toured regularly, with frequent appearances in Carnegie Hall, including a gala special with Sarah Vaughan, and performances in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall and Washington&#x27;s Kennedy Center. In July 1974, Thomas also presided over the BPO dedication concert at Art Park as the Orchestra&#x27;s intended summer home. Thomas resigned in 1978 after accepting an appointment with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

In 1979, Julius Rudel, the former maestro of the New York City Opera, became the music director. Though faced with many financial constraints, Rudel&#x27;s tenure was marked with emphasis on the classical repertoire as well as gala performances with Beverly Sills and Plácido Domingo. Rudel also took the BPO on a West Coast tour and made a commemorative recording with CBS Masterworks of music for the holiday season.

Rudel&#x27;s departure in the spring of 1984 was followed by the appointment of Semyon Bychkov, who had been the BPO&#x27;s Assistant Conductor for the previous three seasons. Bychkov announced that the BPO would make its first tour of Europe in addition to directing the BPO&#x27;s 50th anniversary season and making a commemorative recording featuring Roberta Peters of the Metropolitan Opera. The 1988 European tour consisted of performances at Musikvereinssaal in Vienna, as well as concerts in Geneva, Zurich, Milan, and Frankfurt and other venues in Germany and Switzerland.

Bychkov resigned in 1989 to take over the Orchestre de Paris, with Chilean maestro Maximiano Valdes replacing him as music director.

In 1998 JoAnn Falletta was appointed as the new maestro, becoming the first woman named as the music director of a major U.S. symphony orchestra. Under her direction, the orchestra reinitiated a series of broadcasts on public radio and returned to Carnegie Hall in 2004 and 2013 as part of Spring for Music. Falletta led the orchestra on numerous multi-city tours of Florida, at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in 2012, and in 2018 led a five-city tour of Poland at the invitation of the Ludwig van Beethoven Easter Festival in Warsaw. With Falletta, the BPO also has issued more than 50 new CDs, including twenty on Naxos Records, and has specialized in recording lesser-known European works from the late 19th and early 20th century. Soloists who have appeared with the BPO under maestro Falletta include Van Cliburn, Renée Fleming, Yo-Yo Ma, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Joshua Bell, and Midori. The BPO is one of the most often played orchestras on Performance Today, and BPO concerts are therefore broadcast in over 200 cities annually. Its CDs are frequently featured on the Sirius radio network and it has been featured three times on NPR&#x27;s From the Top.

<doc id="1206782" wikidata="Q231696" url="?curid=1206782" title="Atia (mother of Augustus)">
<text>Atia (also Atia Balba) ( 85 – 43 BC) was the niece of Julius Caesar (through his sister Julia Minor), and mother of Gaius Octavius, who became the Emperor Augustus. Through her daughter Octavia, she was also the great-grandmother of Germanicus and his brother, Emperor Claudius.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Atia was the daughter of Julia Minor and her husband praetor Marcus Atius Balbus. Atia had at least one younger sister, and possibly an older one. Due to this, she is sometimes called &quot;Atia Secunda&quot; or &quot;Atia Balba Secunda&quot;. She may also have had a brother.

===First marriage===
Her first marriage was with Gaius Octavius, the praetor in 61 BC and then Macedonian governor. Her family lived close to Velitrae, ancestral home of the Octavii. They had two children: Octavia Minor, born 66 BC, and Gaius Octavius (Augustus), born in 63 BC.

In his &quot;Dialogus de oratoribus&quot;, Tacitus notes her to be exceptionally religious and moral, and one of the most admired matrons in the history of the Republic:
In her presence no base word could be uttered without grave offence, and no wrong deed done. Religiously and with the utmost delicacy she regulated not only the serious tasks of her youthful charges, but also their recreations and their games.

Suetonius&#x27; account of Augustus mentions the divine omens she experienced before and after his birth:
When Atia had come in the middle of the night to the solemn service of Apollo, she had her litter set down in the temple and fell asleep, while the rest of the matrons also slept. On a sudden a serpent glided up to her and shortly went away. When she awoke, she purified herself, as if after the embraces of her husband, and at once there appeared on her body a mark in colours like a serpent, and she could never get rid of it; so that presently she ceased ever to go to the public baths. In the tenth month after that Augustus was born and was therefore regarded as the son of Apollo. Atia too, before she gave him birth, dreamed that her vitals were borne up to the stars and spread over the whole extent of land and sea, while Octavius dreamed that the sun rose from Atia&#x27;s womb. (Suetonius:94:4)
The day he was born the conspiracy of Catiline was before the House, and Octavius came late because of his wife&#x27;s confinement; then Publius Nigidius, as everyone knows, learning the reason for his tardiness and being informed also of the hour of the birth, declared that the ruler of the world had been born. (Suetonius:94:5)

Octavius died in 59 BC, when their son Gaius Octavius (future Roman emperor Augustus) was four years old.

===Second marriage===
The same year as her first husband died, Atia remarried to Lucius Marcius Philippus, consul in 56 BC. Philippus already had three children at the time; the already adult Lucius Marcius Philippus (&quot;consul suffectus&quot; in 38 BC who ended up marrying Atia&#x27;s younger sister), Marcia (the wife of Cato the Younger) and Quintus Marcius Philippus (proconsul of Cilicia in 47 BC). It&#x27;s possible that she and Philippus had children.

Atia was so fearful for her son&#x27;s safety that she and Philippus urged him to renounce his rights as Caesar&#x27;s heir. She died around 43 BC. Octavian honored her memory with a public funeral.

==Cultural depictions==

A fictionalised Atia of the Julii is portrayed by Polly Walker in the BBC-HBO-RAI television series &quot;Rome&quot;. There, she is portrayed as ambitious, shrewd, manipulative, sexually uninhibited, and morally bankrupt; the program also shows her as involved in a long-term romantic relationship with Marc Antony. Jonathan Stamp, the historical consultant for &quot;Rome&quot;, stated that in addition to the historical Atia, the character version of Atia draws significant influences from other Roman women from the same time period, such as the infamous Clodia, and Marc Antony’s wife, Fulvia.

<text>The Yadavaran Field is an oil field in Khuzestan, Iran. Discovered by the NIOC, it is made up of two former fields, Koushk (discovered in 2000) and Hosseinieh (discovered in 2002). After researchers discovered that the two fields were actually connected, the field was renamed as the Yadavaran Field.

The field is estimated to have reserves of up to 17 billion barrels (2.7 km3) of oil, with 3 billion barrels (0.5 km3) considered to be recoverable.

On October 29, 2004, Iran negotiated a $70 billion deal with Sinopec, giving the Chinese company a 51% stake in the field&#x27;s development. As part of the deal, China agreed to buy 10 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Iran per annum for 25 years.

In December 2007, NIOC and Sinopec signed the final agreement for development of Yadavaran oil field. Based on the contract field will reach to the of production capacity. Sinopec will be operator with a 51% stake in the project and NIOC holding the remaining interest. Total project cost at around US$2 billion.
In a third phase the field is expected to reach of production capacity.

The field will be developed under an enhanced Iranian buyback contract. The most significant revision in terms from earlier versions is that the partners will only agree the target capital cost of the development following receipt of construction tender submissions. This should reduce the contractors’ exposure to value erosion through cost inflation.

The oil field is currently at an early production of after 16 months development by the Chinese contractor.

<text>The Celebes crested macaque (Macaca nigra), also known as the crested black macaque, Sulawesi crested macaque, or the black ape, is an Old World monkey that lives in the tropical regions of north Sulawesi.

==Description==
Locally known as &quot;yaki&quot;, &quot;wolai&quot;, or &quot;bolai&quot;, its skin and hairless face is, with the exception of some white hair in the shoulder range, entirely jet black. Unusual for a primate, it has striking reddish-brown eyes. It has a long muzzle with high cheeks, and a long hair tuft, or crest, at the top of the head. Uniquely among macaques, males and young females bear a heart-shaped skin pad on the rump. It has an ape-like appearance due to its almost non-existent, non-visible, vestigial tail stub of only approximately . Females grow up to , and up to , while males grow up to , and up to , it is one of the smaller macaque species. Its life expectancy is estimated at 18 years in the wild, and 34 was the maximum in captivity.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Macaca nigra&quot; has around 8 subpopulations, with a introduced population on the island of Bacan. &quot;M. nigra&quot; seems to prefer closed canopy forests, with the occupancy being higher along with protected areas.

==Ecology==
The Celebes crested macaque is a diurnal rain forest dweller. This macaque is primarily terrestrial, spending more than 60% of its day on the ground foraging for food and socialising, while sleeping and searching for food in the trees.

The Celebes crested macaque is frugivorous, with 70% of its diet consisting of fruits. It also consumes leaves, buds, seeds, mushrooms, small birds and bird eggs, insects (such as beetles and caterpillars) worms, snails, spiders and the occasional small lizard or frog.

==Group behaviour==
It lives typically in groups of five to twenty-five animals, and occasionally in groups of up to seventy-five animals. Smaller groups have only a single adult male, while larger groups have up to four adult males. However, adult females always outnumber adult males by about 4:1. Young adult males are forced to leave their birth group upon maturity, sometimes forming bachelor groups, before seeking a connection to an existing adult mixed-sex group. Communication consists of various sounds and gestures; such as the presentation of the long canine teeth while grimacing, a clearly threatening gesture.

The Celebes crested macaque is promiscuous, with both males and females mating multiple times with multiple partners. The receptivity of the females is clearly indicated by an extreme tumescence (swelling) and redness of their buttocks which, in contrast to the black skin colour, is particularly noticeable. The gestation time is 174 days, and the birth of the usually single offspring happens in the spring when food is more plentiful. Young animals are nursed for approximately one year, becoming fully mature in three to four years, females somewhat sooner than males.

==Human interactions==

Because it devastates crops and fields, the Celebes crested macaque is hunted as a pest. It is also hunted to provide bushmeat. Clearing the rain forests further threatens its survival. Its situation on the small neighbouring islands of Sulawesi (such as Bacan) is somewhat better, since these have a low human population. The total population of the macaque on Sulawesi is estimated at 4,000–6,000, while a booming population of up to 100,000 monkeys is found on Bacan.

A series of survey trips to Sulawesi and the Minahasa forest area were made in 2004–2009 by Vicki Melfi, who is European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) studbook holder for these macaques, based at Paignton Zoo / the Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust. She has been monitoring population density, which has declined from over 300 individuals per square kilometre in 1980, to 20 to 60 individuals today. A conservation programme called &quot;Selamatkan Yaki&quot;, or Save the &quot;Yaki&quot;, as this macaque is known in the local language, was launched with local partners and other conservation groups from Thailand, Germany, and the Wildlife Conservation Society (based in the United States). Both Newquay Zoo and Paignton Zoo are among a number of mostly European zoos which hold &quot;ex-situ&quot; breeding populations of this animal.

Since 2006, the Macaca Nigra Project has been studying the biology and promoting the conservation of this species. The project, a collaboration between the German Primate Centre and the Bogor Agricultural Institute, is run by Antje Engelhardt, and located in the Tangkoko reserve, home of the biggest crested macaque population remaining in the species&#x27; original distribution range.

Nevertheless, despite being critically endangered, crested black macaque are still unprotected outside of Tangkoko reserve, and they are regularly hunted and slaughtered. They are easily caught and killed, as they have no fear of humans. Crested black macaque is considered a delicacy by local residents.

In 2013, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson spent time on Sulawesi, filming the monkeys at close quarters for a BBC documentary entitled &quot;Meet the Monkeys&quot;.

In 2014, considerable discussion of copyright issues was generated by a &#x27;selfie&#x27; photograph taken by a Celebes crested macaque.

<text>The dumbbell, a type of free weight, is a piece of equipment used in weight training. It is usually used individually and/or in pairs, with one in each hand.

==History==
The forerunner of the dumbbell, halteres, were used in ancient Greece as lifting weights and also as weights for the ancient Greek version of the long jump. A kind of dumbbell was also used in India for more than a millennium, shaped like a club – so it was named Indian club. The design of the &quot;Meel&quot;, as the club was referred to, can be seen as a halfway point between a barbell and a dumbbell. It was generally used in pairs, in workouts by wrestlers, bodybuilders, sports players, and others wishing to increase strength and muscle size.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;dumbbell&quot; or &quot;dumb bell&quot; or &quot;dumb-bell&quot; originated in late Stuart England. In 1711 the poet Joseph Addison mentioned exercising with a &quot;dumb bell&quot; in an essay published in &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

Although Addison elsewhere in the same publication describes having used equipment similar to the modern understanding of dumbbells, according to sport historian Jan Todd, the form of the first dumbbells remains unclear. The Oxford English Dictionary describes &quot;apparatus similar to that used to ring a church bell, but without the bell, so noiseless or ‘dumb’&quot;, implying the action of pulling a bell rope to practice English bellringing.

==Types==
By the early 17th century, the familiar shape of the dumbbell, with two equal weights attached to a handle, had appeared. There are currently three main types of dumbbell:
*Fixed-weight dumbbells are weights created in a dumbbell shape. Inexpensive varieties consist of cast iron, sometimes coated with rubber or neoprene for comfort, and even cheaper versions consist of a rigid plastic shell that is filled with concrete.
* Adjustable dumbbells consist of a metal bar whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern (knurling) to improve grip. Weight plates are slid onto the outer portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars. Shown to the right is a &quot;spinlock&quot; dumbbell, whose ends are threaded to accept large nuts as collars. Alternatively, a dumbbell may have smooth ends with plates being secured by a sprung collar. 
**Plate-loaded (adjustable) dumbbells (a.k.a. loadable dumbbells)
***Spin-lock
***Spring collar clips
***Compression ring collar
*** Ironmaster quick-lock
**Selectorized (adjustable) dumbbells are adjustable dumbbells that allow you to easily alter the weight or number of plates while the dumbbells are resting in the stand. This is accomplished through controlling the amount of plates that follow the handle when lifted, for as by turning a dial or sliding a selector pin, rather than physically adding or removing plates. This makes it simple to adjust the weight of the dumbbell between exercises, and the stand is typically used to hold extra weights that aren&#x27;t required for a certain exercise. There are different types of mechanism:
***Block type
***Dial type
***Glide type
***Twist type
**2-in-1 dumbbell/barbell
===Variations===
* Thomas Inch dumbbell, also known as &quot;172&quot; ( handle, weighs )
* Millennium dumbbell ( handle, weighs )
* Circus dumbbells: historically used in traveling circus acts, these dumbbells have exaggerated ends and wider handles, and just like normal dumbbells, come in various weights and sizes.

<text>A low-floor tram is a tram that has no steps between one or more entrances and part or all of the passenger cabin. The low-floor design improves the accessibility of the tram for the public, and also may provide larger windows and more airspace.

A low-floor tram allows accessible level access from curb level platforms. Level access can also be achieved either by using a high-floor vehicle serving high-platform stops. Currently both types are in use, depending on the station platform infrastructure in existing rail systems. Some systems may make use of former railway alignments where use of existing high platforms is desirable, while others, particularly new systems, may not have the space to site high-level platforms in urban centres.

==Low-floor tram configurations==

Trams traditionally had high floors, and articulated tram designs evolved with low-floor centre sections. Examples of this design are Amsterdam 11G/12G-trams and the Kusttrams in Belgium.

The most common design of 100% low floor vehicles is the multi-articulated design. This uses short carbody sections for the wheels with longer sections between them. Examples of this are the Alstom Citadis and Combino. A different design was developed by MAN. In 1990 the GT6N was the first 100% low-floor tram. These trams are found in ten German cities (such as Bremen and Munich) and in the Swedish city Norrköping. Other designs are only partially low floor, with high floors over the bogies at the outer ends and single axle bogies under the low-floor centre section. North American light rail type vehicles frequently have a similar configuration but with a centre bogie designed to accommodate a low floor situated under a short centre section.

In Vienna, Ultra Low Floor (ULF) Trams can &quot;kneel&quot; at the curbside, reducing the height from the road to only .
Some public transport companies have both low floor and high floor trams. They report that low floor trams have 15% higher maintenance costs for the rolling stock, and 20% higher maintenance costs for the infrastructure on average.

Many low-floor trams have fixed bogies which increase track wear and tear, while decreasing the speed at which a tram can drive through a curve (usually in radius curve). The Škoda ForCity and the newest Alstom Citadis X04 try to counter the effect with pivoting bogies while maintaining 100% low floor design. Prior to the new design, pivoting bogies could only be used under high floors, hence such trams could only be part low-floor, with high-floor sections over the pivoting bogies.

==Historic examples==

The idea of a low-floor tram dates back to the early 20th century when a number of trolley systems began experimenting with various &quot;stepless&quot; designs. Perhaps the most notable is the Hedley-Doyle Stepless car introduced in 1912 for use on Broadway in Manhattan. A number of other cities also purchased Hedley-Doyle Stepless trams after seeing their success in Manhattan. Since these cars had a unique appearance compared to any other trams running at the time, they earned a number of nicknames, including hobble skirt cars, public welfare cars, and sow bellies.

==Typical floor heights==

Typical floor heights of low-floor trams are , and the Ultra Low Floor tram has a floor height of only . For comparison high-floor trams are typically more than and rapid transit using heavy rail trains has floor heights of .

<doc id="1206834" wikidata="Q1078334" url="?curid=1206834" title="Low-floor bus">
<text>A low-floor bus is a bus or trolleybus that has no steps between the ground and the floor of the bus at one or more entrances, and low floor for part or all of the passenger cabin. A bus with a partial low floor may also be referred to as a low-entry bus or seldom a flat-floor bus in some locations.

Low floor refers to a bus deck that is accessible from the sidewalk with only a single step with a small height difference, caused solely by the difference between the bus deck and sidewalk. This is distinct from high-floor, a bus deck design that requires climbing one or more steps (now known as step entrance) to access the interior floor that is placed at a higher height. Being low-floor improves the accessibility of the bus for the public, particularly the elderly and people with disabilities, including those using wheelchairs and walkers. Almost all are rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.

==Configuration==
===Low-floor and low-entry buses===
Low-floor buses are generally divided into two major types: fully low-floor buses with a low floor throughout the length of the bus (more popular in Europe), and low-entry buses with step-free access to only a part of the bus, most commonly between the front door and the middle door (more popular in North America). In North America, both types are commonly called low-floor, as the majority of the vehicle has a low floor, without steps at the doors.

The main reason for choosing a low-entry configuration is to allow better placement for the powertrain and other technical equipment in the raised floor section, in addition to allowing a more comfortable ride on rough roads. Some manufacturers use the initials LF or L in their model designations for fully low-floor models (or in the case of German manufacturers, NF or N, based on the German word &quot;Niederflur&quot;, which means low floor), and in North America buses that are partially low-floor are often also designated LF. In some countries, LE, short for Low Entry, is used by some manufacturers in their model designations for low-entry buses.

===Suspension and powertrain===

Most bus manufacturers achieve a low floor height by making rear-engined rear-wheel drive buses with independent front suspension, so that no axle is needed to pass under the floor of the front part of passenger compartment, or a lowered front axle. Some full low-floor buses also have a lowered rear axle, while the rear axle is not an issue on a low-entry bus.

Many low-floor buses, including the Irisbus Citelis (also in Skoda 24Tr trolleybus version), have the engine in a vertical cabinet at the rear of the bus. Van Hool have a series of &quot;side-engine mid-drive&quot; buses that puts the engine off to one side of the cabin longitudinally between the first and the second axle, to maximize usable cabin space. The same concept was also utilized by Volvo on their B9S articulated chassis.

For smaller buses, such as midibuses, the low-floor capability is achieved by placing the front wheels ahead of the entrance. One of the last types of buses to gain low-floor accessibility as standard was the minibus, where a similar front-wheel arrangement allows around 12 seats and a wheelchair space to be accommodated in very small low-floor minibuses, such as the Optare Alero and Hino Poncho. Accessibility was previously achieved in paratransit type applications, which use small vehicles with the fitment of special lifts. The inception of small low-floor buses has allowed the development of several accessible demand-responsive transport schemes using standard &#x27;off-the-shelf&#x27; buses.

A disadvantage of the low floor is accommodating the bus&#x27;s own wheels. With the low floor, the wheels protrude into the passenger cabin, and need to be contained in wheel pockets of waist height, and this occupies space which would otherwise be used for seating. To allow space for technical equipment, many low-floor buses have the seats mounted on podiums, making a small step up from the floor, while others are able to mount the seats directly to the floor, avoiding the step. Seating layout for a low-floor bus therefore requires careful design. Low floor configuration is also known to have poor side to side dead load distribution within the chassis due to the asymmetrical off-centre placement of driveline components - mainly engine and transmission. As a result, many of such buses require electronically controlled air suspension to compensate the lopsided configuration.

===Other features===

Low-floor buses usually include an area without seating (or seating that folds up) next to at least one of the doors, where wheelchairs, walkers, strollers/prams, and where allowed even bicycles, can be parked. This is sometimes not the only purpose of this area, though, as many operators employ larger standee areas for high occupancy at peak times. Despite the space existing, operators may also insist that only one or two wheelchairs or pushchairs can be accommodated unfolded, due to space/safety concerns.

Low floors can be complemented by a hydraulic or pneumatic &#x27;kneeling device&#x27;, which can be used when the bus is not in motion, tilting it or lowering it at the front axle even further, often down to normal curb height. Depending on how close to the curb the bus is parked and wheelchair design, this can allow wheelchair users to board unaided. Though such technology has been available and in use on high-floor buses since the 1970s, it is of significant utility on low-floor vehicles only where it enables less-mobile passengers to board and leave the vehicle without help from others. Many vehicles are also equipped with wheel-chair lifts, or ramps which, when combined with a low floor, can provide a nearly level entry.

An implementation of the low floor design exists in Australia where custom coaches make a &quot;hybrid&quot; variant of its CB60 bodywork. These buses combine a smaller low floor area with a small underfloor bin for some luggage. Whilst these buses do not provide a full amount of luggage space, they can be used to house more luggage than what can be held inside the bus itself. Another drawback is the arrangement means the section of the bus that is at curb height is very short—consisting of enough space to house the wheelchair area and then rising up, to accommodate the luggage bin. These buses also lack the ability to have a center door.
==Alternatives==
Many bus rapid transit systems employ a level boarding by using high-floor buses stopping at &quot;station&quot; style bus stops. Specially raised sections of curb may also be used to achieve accessibility with lesser low floor models, although this is more expensive for the operator, and only attractive for regular busy scheduled routes. For infrequent routes or routes with hail and ride sections, or demand responsive transport, raised curbs would only be feasible in terminuses.

Some transit agencies refused to order low-floor buses altogether, such as New Jersey Transit and MUNI owing to terrain conditions in the service area. DART still has a preference for high floor buses. Although New York City Transit runs some 40-foot low-floors, it originally refused to order low-floor buses, namely D60LFs from New Flyer, after the D60HF, a high floor model, was discontinued mid-delivery. However, they have demonstrated both the D60LF and NovaBus LFSA, the latter of which they have decided to order.

==Asia==

===India===
Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation
Bangalore is one of the first cities in India that introduced Low Floor buses. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, BMTC operates many services using the premium Volvo 8400LE Low-floor buses. These buses are air-conditioned, and offer features such as automatic transmission, kneeling and wheel-chair ramp, typical of modern city buses. They are also fitted with LED display boards as well as ITS to announce the halts. The corporation also had tried Mercedes-Benz Low-Floor buses as well as Ashok Leyland ULE coaches, but chose to stick to the Volvo offering.

In order to keep the bus ticket prices low, the BMTC operates the majority of their services using Non-Airconditioned Semi-Low Floor (SLF) buses that have a floor height of 650mm as against the 400mm floor height of the true Low-Floor buses. These buses are from Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors, with future procurements planned to be from Eicher (VECV). These cheaper alternative to low-floor buses do not have kneeling or wheel-chair accessible ramps, but they have air suspension and use the same or better seats as those found in the Volvo buses. They also feature manual transmission as against automatic transmission

====New Delhi====

With the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and the development of dedicated corridors for the service, bus service is set to improve. The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has started introducing air-conditioned buses and brand new low-floor buses (with floor height of and even higher on one third area as against available internationally) on city streets to replace the conventional buses. A revamp plan is underway to improve bus-shelters in the city and to integrate GPS systems in DTC buses and bus stops so as to provide reliable information about bus arrivals. The Delhi Government decided to expedite this process and procured 6,600 low floor buses for the DTC before commonwealth games in 2010.

====Kolkata====
Kolkata has an extensive network of government run buses. Recently air-conditioned buses have been introduced by the WBSTC. These buses connects places like the Kolkata Airport, Barasat (Capital Town of North Suburb), New Town, Salt Lake, Howrah, Santragachi (a station on the Howrah-Kharagpur railway line), Kudghat and Tollygunge. The road network in Kolkata is vast. Under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, air conditioned buses have been included as a part of travel comfort to commuters. Air-conditioned buses are operated by West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC) directly &amp; through outsourcing. These buses are served by Tata Marcopolo Buses and Volvo Low Floor Buses. The V Series and VS series bus routes are served by the AC volvo bus and MW series are served by the Tata Marcopolo buses operated by WBSTC. AC Marcopolo buses serve the MH series route operated by WBHIDCO and the MB series route operated by BHBL. Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) also run AC Volvo Bus &amp; Ashok Leylan JanBus.

====Jaipur (Jaipur)====

* Non-AC : Several Non-AC buses are available across the city. There are 10 routes.7 are radial and 10 are circular
* AC: There are six AC routes buses namely AC-1,AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6 and AC-7. JCTSL operates buses from Ashok Leyland and Tata

===Japan===

In Japan, a low-floor bus is called &quot;non-step bus (ノンステップバス)&quot;.
Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation used to calling a low-floor bus &quot;no-step bus (ノーステップバス)&quot;.
At Enshu Railway Company in Hamamatsu Area, a low-floor bus is called &quot;omnibus (オムニバス)&quot;, &quot;&quot;cho-teisho&quot; bus (超低床バス; very low-floor bus)&quot; and &quot;&quot;cho-teisho&quot; omnibus (超低床オムニバス; very low-floor omnibus)&quot;.
Japanese government calls a low-floor bus &quot;&quot;cho-teisho&quot; non-step bus (超低床ノンステップバス; very low-floor non-step bus)&quot;. 

The term non-step bus may also refer to a high floor bus where the floor is flat in order to align with the high platforms in 
certain Bus Rapid Transit systems. Thereby, referring to it as a non-step high floor bus.
===Philippines===

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) mandates the use of low-floor or low-entry buses on city bus routes in the Philippines since 2016. 

Low-floor buses are used on city bus networks in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Davao City, and on some provincial routes, and most Point-to-Point Bus services, although older coaches are still largely used for such services.

Buses used on the EDSA Busway are usually equipped with 1-2 doors on the left side for boarding at the median stations, although not all units currently have them installed. 

Low-floor buses often use upholstered coach-style seating in a 2-3, or 2-2 configuration, although plastic seats may be found in some buses. 

===Singapore===
Low-floor wheelchair-accessible buses were first introduced in Singapore in 2006 with 150 Volvo B9TL CDGE buses procured by SBS Transit. These buses were registered SBS7300P - SBS7499A. Volvo B9TL CDGE buses were fully retired in 2023. 

In 2007, SBS Transit procured 1101 units of low-entry Scania K230UB buses bodied by Gemilang Coachworks of Senai, Malaysia. Afterwards, all new city buses procured by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and the Land Transport Authority are low-floor.

==Europe==

===Germany===
Low-floor buses are first adopted in Germany in 1989, and to make them easier to use for wheelchairs and strollers, the minimum ground clearance of the entire vehicle is lowered and the floor is proportionately raised by above the road surface.

===United Kingdom===


The Dennis Dart SLF (Super Low Floor) marked the wholesale introduction of single-deck low floor buses in the United Kingdom in 1995, after many small-scale demonstrator usages. Low floor buses were rapidly introduced on high-profile routes, notably becoming a requirement for London Buses contracts. The Optare Solo introduced in 1997 marked another step change with inroads into smaller usages traditionally served by minibuses. The final phase came with low floor double-deckers the Dennis Trident 2 and Volvo B7TL entering the mass market, even though they were introduced after the Optare Spectra.

London Buses was one of the earliest major users of low-floor buses, with the first low-floor single decker vehicles entering service in 1993 and the first low-floor double decker vehicles entering service in 1998. Following withdrawal of older, high-floor vehicles such as the AEC Routemaster, the bus fleet became fully accessible at the end of 2005, 10 years ahead of the national requirement. London was one of the first major cities in the world to have a fully accessible bus fleet.

Due to the deregulated nature of the public transport system in the UK, adoption of the higher cost low floor buses was usually in conjunction with some sort of grant or quality partnership with a local authority, as the profitability of many routes was not high enough to justify conversion based purely on increased revenue. It has been reported however that adoption of so-called &quot;Easy Access&quot; buses does have a positive effect of ridership and revenue levels.

Under the Transport Act 1985 the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) (or commonly DiPTAC) was established to provide independent consultation on accessibility issues. In the same year, the first low floor bus specification was drafted by DPTAC. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 provided for the completion of the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000, which specified that all new public service vehicles over 22 seats should be low floor from 31 December 2000, with smaller vehicles mandated from 1 January 2005. The 2000 regulations do not require retro-fitting of pre-existing vehicles or the enforced sale of non-compliant existing vehicles, allowing operators to retain a high floor vehicle until &quot;the end of their economic life&quot;. In reality, as the prevalence of low floor buses spreads, combined with grants/incentives, it is likely that the prevalence of high floor vehicles in the national fleet will markedly reduce before all buses were de-registered by 27 October 2014. In the past, in times of reduced economic investment, it was not uncommon for service buses to be used for 15 to 20 years.

While some coaches have been produced with a small front low floor section at the driver&#x27;s level, most coaches in the UK are being made accessible through the use of wheelchair lifts, with the 2005 Caetano Levante being one of the largest introductions.

While another widely stated benefit of low floor buses is quicker boarding for able-bodied passengers due to the lack of steps, studies have found the opposite effect in the UK. This is apparently due to the prevailing system of operation where passengers enter and exit through one single front door. It has been suggested that the previous 1980s/90s high floor step entrance buses which featured a centre rail, encouraged a bi-directional flow of entering and exiting passengers simultaneously. The removal of the pole to allow wheelchair/buggy access created the situation where the quintessentially polite British bus passenger would wait for all passengers to alight before boarding, leading to an increase in dwell times.

===Russia===

Moscow was the to introduce low floor as the compulsory requirement for the suppliers of the city buses. By 2005 a few hundreds of low-floor buses started intra-metropolitan service. At first, PAZ-3237 was selected for the city centre, while LiAZ-5292 were chosen to serve city outskirts. Later the articulated version of the latter, specifically designed for Moscow, the LiAZ-6213 was introduced.

In St.Petersburg the transition to low-floor-only city bus services was completed only by 2021. Besides LiAZ-5292 and LiAZ-6213 and other full low-floor models that account for 85% of the city buses, there are also semi low-floor buses in service, with elevated floor in the rear end of the bus. The same applies to trolley buses that are mostly of low-floor design.

Other cities that use low-floor buses on the regular routes are Kazan, Sochi, Tyumen, Pskov and more. Most of these vehicles are domestically manufactured by LiAZ, GAZ, KAMAZ and Volgabus.

==Americas==

===United States===

In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act is credited with motivating the development of low-floor buses, directly affecting the standardized design of the Transbus Program, which concluded with the introduction of so-called &#x27;interim&#x27; Advanced Design Buses with a lower floor height but which required lifts to board passengers in wheelchairs. The first low-floor (low-entry) buses to be delivered were the New Flyer Low Floor D40LF, to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1991. The New Flyer LF was derived from the . Other competitors followed suit, with the Orion VI (1995), Nova Bus LF Series (1996, also derived from the Den Oudsten B85), Gillig Low Floor (1997, derived from a shuttle bus design for the Hertz rental car agency), and Neoplan AN440L (1990/94/99). By 2008, most new bus orders in the United States were for low-floor buses.

===Argentina===
In the capital of this country, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, since 1997 the legislation governs that all buses of lines of &quot;national&quot; jurisdiction (bus lines that circulate within the capital district and/or cross from here to the suburbs). The first low-floor bus produced in Argentina and marketed in this country was the El Detalle OA105, and the first low-floor bus imported by Argentina was the Marcopolo Torino GV Low-Entry brought from Brazil in 1998.
===Paraguay===
Within Paraguay&#x27;s public transit system, it was not until 2012 that the first low-floor bus in the country were added to its fleet, being a 1999 Marcopolo Viale imported used from Argentina.

=== Brazil ===
In São Paulo, low-floor buses began to become popular in the 2000s with the creation of the so-called Sistema Interligado (Interconnected System, in English) which divided bus routes into so-called lines:

Structural, which connect the large terminals of the regions to the center, or connect two large terminals of two regions passing through the center 

Regional Articulation, which connect distant neighborhoods to the center without passing through large terminals, or connect two distant neighborhoods passing through important regions. 

Locations/distributors, which connect neighborhoods to large terminals or stations. None of these lines pass through the city center.

Low-floor buses have become popular on the Structural and Regional Articulation lines, and have been a mandatory model to be purchased for these since 2015. Until then, exceptions for local lines with low-floor buses were rare, but this has been changing since 2019 and especially since 2023. In 2023, the city banned the purchase of new diesel buses. With the mandatory use of electric buses, new buses on local lines are also being made with low floors, as there is a very low or non-existent availability of high-floor electric buses.

The majority of standard and truncated vehicles were and are the Caio Millennium and Millennium BRT &quot;toco&quot; models, on Mercedes-Benz O500U, Scania K270 and K310, Volvo B7RLE and B290RLE and Volkswagen 17.240 and 17.260 chassis. 

For articulated vehicles, Caio Mondego HA and Millennium BRT vehicles with Mercedes-Benz O500UA and O500UDA chassis were and are used. 

The Biarticulates were made with Caio TopBus PB and Millennium BRT TopBus bodies on Volvo B360S and B9Salf chassis.

==Oceania==

===Australia===

====Brisbane====
In Brisbane, all Translink buses are of a low-floor design. A small number of higher capacity articulated low-floor buses are used to service the city&#x27;s southern busways.

====Sydney====
In Sydney, routes may be operated by both high-floor buses and low-entry ones. Selected routes can be set aside specifically for low-entry buses which are considered to be wheelchair-accessible routes. A recent all-low-entry bus network is the Metrobus system.

<text>Phyllis Barbara Lambert (née Bronfman; born January 24, 1927) is a Canadian architect, philanthropist, and member of the Bronfman family.

==Life==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, she studied at The Study, a premier independent school for girls, and was educated at the liberal arts Vassar College (A.B. in 1948). At the age of nine she was already committed to sculpture and her drawing skills were commented upon as remarkable early on in life. And at eleven she began exhibiting in annual juried exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts and the Société des Sculpteurs du Canada. While reading architecture history in New York she became engaged with the connections of art and architecture which would last a lifetime. Her family is of Jewish background.

On 17 May 1949, in Montreal, she married Jean Lambert, a French-German economic consultant and the only son of Adolphe Lambert of Elmhurst, Queens, New York. The couple divorced in 1954. After the divorce she decided to remain in Paris, living and working alone in a studio on her art and sculpting.

In 1951 Lambert&#x27;s father Samuel Bronfman established Cemp Investments, a holding company for his four children, in which Phyllis was given a 22% ownership stake. It controlled the family&#x27;s distilling empire, The Seagram Company Ltd., which over time controlled billions of dollars in liquor, real estate, oil and gas, and chemical companies.

== Work ==

While Lambert was living in Paris, the Seagram Company Ltd was planning a new headquarters in New York City under her father&#x27;s instructions. During her time in Paris, she had come into contact with the newest artistic and architectural movements of the time. She was vehemently against the building that had already been designed for the plot by Pereira and Luckman Architects. In an eight-page letter to her father (dated June 28, 1954), the 27-year-old Phyllis managed to convince him to re-think the initial project. She was given the mandate to find a suitable alternative and after an extended research lasting six weeks Mies van der Rohe was brought forward as the new candidate. He received the project and became her mentor supporting her in her wish to become an architect. From 1954 to 1958, she was immersed in the process of designing and building the Seagram Building on Park Avenue in New York City. Though she enrolled at the Yale School of Architecture in 1958, she then changed to the Illinois Institute of Technology, which she felt better suited to what she wanted to learn.

Lambert later became the consultant to the Seagram Building, entrusted with its maintenance including the supervision and the curation of all exhibitions and collections, until 2000.

After she obtained her master&#x27;s degree in 1963, her family commissioned her to design an arts centre in Montreal to be known as the Saidye Bronfman Centre, in honor of her mother. Lambert designed a ‘Miesian Structure’.

After the demolition of the Van Horne Mansion on Sherbrooke Street in 1973, 23 citizen groups formed Sauvons Montréal. Lambert became one of the advocates in the efforts to revitalize the struggling Shaughnessy Village district.

In 1975, she founded the heritage preservation group Heritage Montreal. (She served as its first president until 1983.) Héritage Montréal raised funds so that conservation groups could take action. Their tools to stop demolition included marching in the streets, publishing ads and booklets and working with residents. They developed Canada&#x27;s largest non-profit cooperative housing renovation, Milton-Parc.

Lambert also saved Shaughnessy House from demolition by buying it. In 1989 the 19th century mansion became part of the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA).

She considered an investment in renovating low-to medium-income neighbourhoods as important as the conservation of monuments or building anew. Since 1997 she held the Fonds d’investissement Montréal (FIM). It achieved in bringing private sector investment to communitarian housing beyond the limits of government programs.

In 1979, she founded the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA),  an influential museum and research centre in Montreal&#x27;s Shaughnessy Village neighbourhood, and donated 750,000 shares of Seagram to help fund the Centre. It houses extensive collections of architectural drawings, books, photographs, and archival materials. The guiding belief of the CCA is that &quot;architecture is a public concern,&quot; and its collection and activities &quot;are driven by a curiosity about how architecture shapes—and might reshape—contemporary life.&quot;

She served on the board of directors of Cemp&#x27;s subsidiary, Cadillac Fairview for which she later picketed the offices of project developer. Again she suggested working with Mies and supported what was to be known as the Toronto-Dominion Centre.

Her work also includes serving as developer on the restoration of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles by architect Gene Summers (architect).

== National and International Recognition ==
In 1990 she received an honorary DFA in Architecture from the Pratt Institute. In 1992, she was made Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres de France. She holds honorary degrees from some 26 universities in North America and in Europe.

In 1985 she was made a Member of the Order of Canada, promoted to Officer in 1990, and promoted to Companion in 2001. In 1985, she was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec and was promoted to Grand Officer in 2005.

Lambert was awarded the Vincent Scully Prize by the National Building Museum in 2006. Executive director Chase Rynd stated, &quot;The Museum is honored to present its 2006 Scully Prize to Phyllis Lambert for a lifetime of outstanding achievements in the design of the built environment. From the Seagram Building to the CCA, to her work as a preservationist and educator, Phyllis Lambert has deeply enhanced the world we build for ourselves.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Citizen Lambert: Joan of architecture&quot;, a documentary film about Lambert was directed by Teri Wehn-Damisch.

Lambert was the recipient of the Golden Lion at the 14th Venice Architecture Biennale. In 2016, she was awarded the Wolf Prize in Arts.

Alongside Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, Cornelia Oberlander and Denise Scott Brown, she is one of four prominent female architects profiled in the 2018 documentary film &quot;City Dreamers&quot;.

In 2023, Phyllis Lambert was awarded the Ada Louise Huxtable prize for her contribution to the wider architectural industry.

<doc id="1206851" wikidata="Q418998" url="?curid=1206851" title="Flurazepam">
<text>Flurazepam (marketed under the brand names Dalmane and Dalmadorm) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It produces a metabolite with a long half-life, which may stay in the bloodstream for days. 

Flurazepam was patented in 1968 and came into medical use the same year. Flurazepam, developed by Roche Pharmaceuticals, was one of the first benzodiazepine hypnotic medications to be marketed.

== Medical uses ==
Flurazepam is officially indicated for mild to moderate insomnia and as such it is used for short-term treatment of patients with mild to moderate insomnia such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Flurazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep, though benzodiazepines with intermediate half-lives such as loprazolam, lormetazepam, and temazepam are also indicated for patients with difficulty maintaining sleep.

Flurazepam was temporarily unavailable in the United States when its sole producer, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, discontinued making it in January 2019. In October 2019, the FDA informed pharmacies that they could expect to be resupplied by manufacturers in early to mid December 2019. As of this date, flurazepam is now again available in the United States.

== Side effects ==
The most common adverse effects are dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, and ataxia. Flurazepam has abuse potential and should never be used with alcoholic beverages or any other substance that can cause drowsiness. Addictive and possibly fatal results may occur. Flurazepam users should only take this drug strictly as prescribed, and should only be taken directly before the user plans on sleeping a full night. Next day drowsiness is common and may increase during the initial phase of treatment as accumulation occurs until steady-state plasma levels are attained.

A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo.

In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

=== Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal ===

A review paper found that long-term use of flurazepam is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia and central nervous system (CNS) related adverse effects. Flurazepam is best used for a short time period and at the lowest possible dose to avoid complications associated with long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality. Flurazepam and other benzodiazepines such as fosazepam, and nitrazepam lost some of their effect after seven days administration in psychogeriatric patients. Flurazepam shares cross tolerance with barbiturates and barbiturates can easily be substituted by flurazepam in those who are habituated to barbiturate sedative hypnotics.

After discontinuation of flurazepam a rebound effect or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur about four days after discontinuation of medication.

== Contraindications and special caution ==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

=== Elderly ===
Flurazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including flurazepam, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy in elderly persons. Tolerability in elderly patients, however, is improved marginally in that benzodiazepines have moderately higher risks of falls, memory problems, and disinhibition (&quot;paradoxical agitation&quot;) when compared to non-benzodiazepine sedatives. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Chronic use of sedative-hypnotic drugs for the management of insomnia does not have an evidence base and has been discouraged due to concerns including potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of sedative hypnotics has been determined to be no better than placebo after 3 months of therapy and worse than placebo after 6 months of therapy.

== Pharmacology ==
Flurazepam is a &quot;classical&quot; benzodiazepine; some other classical benzodiazepines include diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Flurazepam generates an active metabolite, N-desalkylflurazepam, with a very long elimination half-life. Flurazepam could be therefore unsuitable as a sleeping medication for some individuals due to next-day sedation; however, this same effect may also provide next-day anxiety relief. Residual &#x27;hangover&#x27; effects after nighttime administration of flurazepam, such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions, may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures.

Flurazepam is lipophilic, is metabolized hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main pharmacological effect of flurazepam is to increase the effect of GABA at the GABAA receptor via binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor causing an increase influx of chloride ions into the GABAA neuron.

Flurazepam is contraindicated in pregnancy. It is recommended to withdraw flurazepam during breast feeding, as flurazepam is excreted in breast milk.

== Misuse ==
Flurazepam is a drug with potential for misuse. Two types of drug misuse can occur, either recreational misuse where the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice.

=== Legal status ===
Flurazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

<text>In grammar, the temporal case (or Temporalis abbreviated ) is a grammatical case used to indicate a time. 

In the Hungarian language its suffix is &quot;-kor&quot;. For example: &quot;hétkor&quot; &quot;at seven&quot; or &quot;hét órakor&quot; &quot;at seven o&#x27;clock&quot;, &quot;éjfélkor&quot; &quot;at midnight&quot;, &quot;karácsonykor&quot; &quot;at Christmas&quot;. This is one of the few suffixes in Hungarian to which rules of vowel harmony do not apply.

In Finnish its suffix is &quot;-lloin / -llöin&quot;. For example: &quot;milloin&quot; - when?; &quot;jolloin&quot; - when (relative pronoun); &quot;tällöin&quot; - at this time; &quot;silloin&quot; - then; &quot;tuolloin&quot; - at that time. 

In Russian the function of temporal case is assumed by Instrumental, e.g. &quot;утр-ом&quot; (base form is &quot;утро&quot;) - in the morning, &quot;дн-ём&quot; (base form is &quot;день&quot;) - in the daytime/in the afternoon, &quot;вечер-ом&quot; (base form is &quot;вечер&quot;) - at night/in the evening, &quot;ночь-ю&quot; (base form is &quot;ночь&quot;) - at nighttime/in the night.

<doc id="1206859" wikidata="Q908783" url="?curid=1206859" title="Extended X-ray absorption fine structure">
<text>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), along with X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), is a subset of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Like other absorption spectroscopies, XAS techniques follow Beer&#x27;s law. The X-ray absorption coefficient of a material as a function of energy is obtained by directing X-rays of a narrow energy range at a sample, while recording the incident and transmitted x-ray intensity, as the incident x-ray energy is incremented.

When the incident x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron of an atom within the sample, the number of x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing a drop in the transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an absorption edge. Every element has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at synchrotrons because the high intensity of synchrotron X-ray sources allows the concentration of the absorbing element to reach as low as a few parts per million. Absorption would be undetectable if the source were too weak. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids.

==Background==

EXAFS spectra are displayed as plots of the absorption coefficient of a given material versus energy, typically in a 500 – 1000 eV range beginning before an absorption edge of an element in the sample. The x-ray absorption coefficient is usually normalized to unit step height. This is done by regressing a line to the region before and after the absorption edge, subtracting the pre-edge line from the entire data set and dividing by the absorption step height, which is determined by the difference between the pre-edge and post-edge lines at the value of E0 (on the absorption edge).

The normalized absorption spectra are often called XANES spectra. These spectra can be used to determine the average oxidation state of the element in the sample. The XANES spectra are also sensitive to the coordination environment of the absorbing atom in the sample. Finger printing methods have been used to match the XANES spectra of an unknown sample to those of known &quot;standards&quot;. Linear combination fitting of several different standard spectra can give an estimate to the amount of each of the known standard spectra within an unknown sample.

The dominant physical process in x-ray absorption is one where the absorbed photon ejects a core photoelectron from the absorbing atom, leaving behind a core hole. The ejected photoelectron&#x27;s energy will be equal to that of the absorbed photon minus the binding energy of the initial core state. The atom with the core hole is now excited and the ejected photoelectron interacts with electrons in the surrounding non-excited atoms.

If the ejected photoelectron is taken to have a wave-like nature and the surrounding atoms are described as point scatterers, it is possible to imagine the backscattered electron waves interfering with the forward-propagating waves. The resulting interference pattern shows up as a modulation of the measured absorption coefficient, thereby causing the oscillation in the EXAFS spectra. A simplified plane-wave single-scattering theory has been used for interpretation of EXAFS spectra for many years, although modern methods (like FEFF, GNXAS) have shown that curved-wave corrections and multiple-scattering effects can not be neglected. The photelectron scattering amplitude in the low energy range (5-200 eV) of the photoelectron kinetic energy become much larger so that multiple scattering events become dominant in the XANES (or NEXAFS) spectra.

The wavelength of the photoelectron is dependent on the energy and phase of the backscattered wave which exists at the central atom. The wavelength changes as a function of the energy of the incoming photon. The phase and amplitude of the backscattered wave are dependent on the type of atom doing the backscattering and the distance of the backscattering atom from the central atom. The dependence of the scattering on atomic species makes it possible to obtain information pertaining to the chemical coordination environment of the original absorbing (centrally excited) atom by analyzing these EXAFS data.

=== EXAFS Equation ===

The effect of the backscattered photoelectron on the absorption spectra is described by the EXAFS equation, first demonstrated by Sayers, Stern, and Lytle. The oscillatory part of the dipole matrix element is given by formula_1, where the sum is over the formula_2 sets of neighbors of the absorbing atom, formula_3 is the number of atoms at distance formula_4, formula_5 is the wavenumber and is proportional to energy, formula_6 is the thermal vibration factor with formula_7 being the mean square amplitude of the atom&#x27;s relative displacements, formula_8 is the mean free path of the photoelectron with momentum formula_5 (this is related to coherence of the quantum state), and formula_10 is an element dependent scattering factor.

formula_11

The origin of the oscillations in the absorption cross section are due to the formula_12 term which imposes the interference condition, leading to peaks in absorption when the wavelength of the photoelectron is equal to an integer fraction of formula_13 (the round trip distance from the absorbing atom to the scattering atom). This is analogous to eigenstates of the particle in a box toy model. The formula_14 factor inside the formula_12 is an element dependent phase shift.

==Experimental considerations==

Since EXAFS requires a tunable x-ray source, data are frequently collected at synchrotrons, often at beamlines which are especially optimized for the purpose. The utility of a particular synchrotron to study a particular solid depends on the brightness of the x-ray flux at the absorption edges of the relevant elements.

Recent developments in the design and quality of crystal optics have allowed for some EXAFS measurements to take place in a lab setting, where the tunable x-ray source is achieved via a Rowland circle geometry. While experiments requiring high x-ray flux or specialized sample environments can still only be performed at synchrotron facilities, absorption edges in the 5 - 30 keV range are feasible for lab based EXAFS studies.

== Applications ==

XAS is an interdisciplinary technique and its unique properties, as compared to x-ray diffraction, have been exploited for
understanding the details of local structure in:

* glass, amorphous and liquid systems
* solid solutions
* doping and ionic implantation of materials for electronics
* local distortions of crystal lattices
* organometallic compounds
* metalloproteins
* metal clusters
* vibrational dynamics
* ions in solutions
* chemical speciation analysis
XAS provides complementary to diffraction information on peculiarities of local structural and thermal disorder in crystalline and multi-component materials.

The use of atomistic simulations such as molecular dynamics or the reverse Monte Carlo method can help in extracting more reliable and richer structural information.

==Examples==
EXAFS is, like XANES, a highly sensitive technique with elemental specificity. As such, EXAFS is an extremely useful way to determine the chemical state of practically important species which occur in very low abundance or concentration. Frequent use of EXAFS occurs in environmental chemistry, where scientists try to understand the propagation of pollutants through an ecosystem. EXAFS can be used along with accelerator mass spectrometry in forensic examinations, particularly in nuclear non-proliferation applications.

==History==

A very detailed, balanced and informative account about the history of EXAFS (originally called Kossel&#x27;s structures) is given by R. Stumm von Bordwehr.
A more modern and accurate account of the history of XAFS (EXAFS and XANES) is given by the leader of the group that developed the modern version of EXAFS in an award lecture by Edward A. Stern.

<doc id="1206861" wikidata="Q14479580" url="?curid=1206861" title="Wack Pack">
<text>The Wack Pack is the name given to an assortment of personalities heard throughout the history of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. As a parody of the Rat Pack or Brat Pack, Stern biographer Richard Mintzer has labeled them a key part of the show. Members tend to be unusual in some way: being blatantly racist, mentally disabled, having a comical appearance, voice or ability, or some combination thereof. As of 2023, twenty-two living individuals are designated &quot;Wack Packers&quot; (along with a number of deceased). Not every regular guest on or caller to the show is considered a member, nor are any of the show&#x27;s staff members; Stern has stated that Wack Packers are not defined by having any disability or peculiarity, but by their inability to understand why they are funny.

Through their appearances on the radio show, some Wack Packers have gained notoriety for personal appearances around the country and occasionally, played roles in films and television programs.

==History==
In the 1993 book &quot;Private Parts&quot;, Howard Stern lists early members of the Wack Pack, including Irene the Leather Weather Lady, who is essentially the first Wack Packer, having met Stern in May 1980 when he was broadcasting from WWWW in Detroit, Michigan. Upon the introduction of Fred the Elephant Boy on the radio show on November 28, 1988, among a collection of others, Stern began calling the group of show personalities the &quot;Wack Pack&quot; on July 6, 1990, as documented in Stern&#x27;s &quot;The History of Howard Stern&quot; radio series. Since moving to Sirius XM Radio, Stern has offered some members of the Wack Pack their own shows.

==Official list==

On February 24, 2015, Stern and crew voted on an &quot;official&quot; list of Wack Pack members.
===Living Wack Packers===
The following individuals are official Howard Stern Show Wack Pack members: 
*Asian Pete
*Ass Napkin Ed
*Beetlejuice, named &quot;Greatest Wack Packer of All Time&quot; (Lester Green)
*Bigfoot (Mark Shaw, Jr., not to be confused with actor Matthew McGrory, who previously had the name &quot;Bigfoot&quot; on the show.)
*Debbie the Cum Lady
*Gary the Conqueror (Gary Loudermilk, previously known as Gary the Retard)
*High Pitch Erik (Erik Bleaman)
*High Register Sean (named in 2019)
*Jeff the Drunk (Jeff Curro, also known as Jeff the Bore)
*Jeff the Vomit Guy (Jeff Levy)
*John the Stutterer (not to be confused with former staff member and former &quot;Tonight Show&quot; announcer Stuttering John Melendez)
*Lenny Dykstra
*Mark the Bagger (Mark Rothenberger) 
*Medicated Pete (Pete McHeffey)
*Melrose Larry Green
*Miss Howard Stern (Andrea Ownbey)
*Monotone Matt
*Siobhan the Transsexual
*Sour Shoes (Michael DelCampo)
*Tan Mom (Patricia Krentcil)
*Underdog Lady (Suzanne Muldowney)
*Wendy the Slow Adult (formerly Wendy the Retard)

===Former Wack Packers===
*Hanzi (Imran Khan) (permanently banned from show, April 2016)

===&quot;Not Wack Pack Material&quot;===
The following individuals were at one time considered Wack Pack members. However, since 2015, they were excluded by Stern and his staff from the Wack Pack for reasons including their ability to hold a job and function in society, while still having a funny or unusual personality. 
*Angry Black
*Big Black
*Bobo (Steve Bowe). Bobo lost his name temporarily and was known as Steve from Florida. In June 2017, Bobo endured a humiliating act to win his name back on the show.
*Captain Janks (Tom Cipriano)

*Eddie the Produce Guy
*Elegant Elliot Offen (permanently banned from show, 2006)
*Gay Ramón
*Ham Hands Bill
*Hate Man
*Hate Woman
*The Kielbasa Queen (Denise Miller)

<text>3C 58 or 3C58 is a pulsar (designation PSR J0205+6449) and supernova remnant (pulsar wind nebula) within the Milky Way. The object is listed as No. 58 in the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources.

It is located 2° northeast of ε Cassiopeiae and is estimated to be 10,000 light-years away. Its rotation period is 65.7 ms (so PSR J0205+6449 does not belong to the class of millisecond pulsars).

The pulsar is notable for its very high rate of cooling, which is unexplained by standard models of neutron star formation. It is hypothesized that extreme conditions in the star&#x27;s interior cause a high neutrino flux, which carries away the energy so that the star cools.
3C 58 has been proposed as a possible quark star, also referred to as a strange star.

The age of the 3C 58 remnant has been measured by a number of independent methods. The proper motion of the expanding optical shell of 3C 58 has been measured three times, always with an indicated age of around 3500 years, with this being the direct and distance-independent measure.
Estimates from the expansion measurements of the filamentary structure in the radio of the synchrotron nebula suggest the age to roughly 7000 years, independent of distance.
Several methods for estimating the remnant&#x27;s age have proven to have such a large uncertainty as to not be useful, with these methods including those involving the pulsar energetics, the swept-up mass, the pulsar offset from the center of 3C 58, and the changing of the nebular radio brightness.
The spin-down age of the pulsar is 5380 years, while the cooling age of the neutron star is &gt;5000 years. Taking all available evidence, 3C 58 has an age somewhere from 3500 to 5500 years.

From 1971 to 2021, 3C 58 has been speculatively connected to the Supernova of 1181 AD, as reported by Chinese and Japanese observers. The basis for this was that 3C 58 was the only supernova remnant known in the large old historical region for the SN 1181. However, multiple factors, including the age (3500 to 5500 years) and energetics of the remnant, all point to 3C 58 as not being the remnant of SN 1181. Further, an analysis of the old East Asian reports used added information on the reported proximity to several old Chinese constellations, and concluded that 3C 58 is at a sky position far outside the error region of the observed SN 1181. A second conclusive argument is that the real remnant of SN 1181 was discovered by American amateur astronomer Dana Patchik, designated Pa 30. Pa 30 is known from multiple independent measures to be a supernova remnant with an age close to 800 years, and it is inside the modern sky position for the 1181 supernova.
So 3C 58 is not the remnant left behind by the 1181 supernova.

The leaves are elliptic to lanceolate, 6–16 cm long and 3–7 cm broad with a 1–3 cm petiole, and have brown pubescence on the underside. The flowers are drooping, 8–12 cm in diameter, with nine (occasionally 12) tepals, the outer three small and greenish, sepal-like, the main six larger and pure white; the stamens and carpels are crimson. Due to their drooping character, the flowers are best viewed from the underside.

This species is threatened by habitat destruction and collection for medicinal use (see Houpu magnolia), and regeneration is poor.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Magnolia wilsonii&quot;, though rare, is in cultivation as an ornamental tree and planted in temperate climate gardens, such as in coastal California. It needs a protected planting location with afternoon shade. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>De Selby (spelled &quot;de Selby&quot; in &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; and &quot;De Selby&quot; in &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;) is a fictional character originally created by Flann O&#x27;Brien for his novel &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, in which the nameless narrator intends to use the proceeds of murder and robbery to publish his commentaries on de Selby – a savant who theorizes, among other things, that the earth is actually shaped like a sausage.

==Fictional character profile==
Described as an eminent &quot;physicist, ballistician, philosopher and psychologist&quot;, de Selby is known for his paradoxically non-scientific beliefs and personality. De Selby serves as an unseen character in &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, where he is discussed at length in references and footnotes which tenuously link his unorthodox theories and areas of research to the plot. (In one footnote, he attempts to dilute water; in another, he posits that night is caused by the accumulation of &quot;black air&quot;.) O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot; focused on de Selby himself.

In &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;, de Selby develops a substance (&quot;D.M.P.&quot;) capable of extracting all oxygen from an airtight enclosure, thus disrupting the sequentiality of time, incidentally making it possible to produce fine mature whiskey in a week. De Selby vows to use the substance to destroy the world in the name of God.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s text and footnotes mention a number of de Selby&#x27;s works including &quot;Golden Hours&quot;, &quot;The Country Album,&quot; &quot;A Memoir of Garcia,&quot; &quot;Layman&#x27;s Atlas&quot; and the &quot;Codex&quot;. The fictional Bassett and Hatchjaw wrote biographies &quot;Lux Mundi: A memoir of de Selby&quot; and &quot;de Selby&#x27;s Life and Times&quot;, both lost. Le Fournier, du Garbandier, Kraus and Le Clerque are supposed sources of de Selby material, but their works (suiting the fiction) were lost.

As discussed in &quot;Irish Philosophy&quot;, de Selby believed human existence was &quot;a succession of static experiences each infinitely brief&quot; and &quot;a journey is a hallucination&quot; which he demonstrated by travelling from Bath to Folkestone by means of picture postcards of the supposed route, barometric instruments, clocks and a device to regulate gaslight to simulate sunlight at various &quot;times&quot; of day. Another theory of de Selby&#x27;s was that mirrors held the secret to eternity, claiming a huge array of parallel mirrors allowed him to see his own face as a boy of twelve.
==Analysis==
De Selby has a host of critical analyzers – the narrator among them – many of whom have deeply conflicting opinions of his esoteric thoughts. Although generally held in high regard by these people (many of whom hate each other), he is thought by many to have had regrettable lapses and is even called, by implication, a &quot;nincompoop&quot;. In &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; one of de Selby&#x27;s biographers is quoted as saying &quot;The beauty of reading a page of de Selby is that it leads one inescapably to the happy conviction that one is not, of all nincompoops, the greatest.&quot;

==In other works==
&quot;de Selby&quot; and his commentators are frequently cited in the footnotes of Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Son&quot;. Wilson later included Professor de Selby as the main character in his short story &quot;The Horror on Howth Hill&quot; where de Selby has a conversation with J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs.

Irish musician Hozier referenced De Selby in the tracks &quot;De Selby (Part 1)&quot; and &quot;De Selby (Part 2)&quot; on his 2023 album &quot;Unreal Unearth.&quot;

<text>The Smithsonian Institution is an alternate history novel by Gore Vidal, first published in 1998. 

The novel is a fictional account of the adventures of &quot;T.&quot; as he helps a group of scientists in the basement of the Smithsonian create the neutron bomb, and encounters historical figures such as President Abraham Lincoln, Charles Lindbergh, Eleanor Roosevelt and Mrs. Grover Cleveland.

Reviewer Merle Rubin advises readers to &quot;skip this&quot; Vidal novel and &quot;spend more profitable time rediscovering the many and varied pleasures of his earlier novels&quot;.

<text>Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP (known as Cravath; ) is an American white-shoe law firm headquartered in New York City. The firm has additional offices in London and Washington, D.C. 

==History==
In 1854, former college classmates William H. Seward (later Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of State) and Richard M. Blatchford merged their respective law firms, forming Blatchford, Seward &amp; Griswold.

Blatchford served in the New York State Assembly, and as U.S. Minister to the State of the Church. His son, Samuel, also a partner at the firm, served as a federal district court and appeals court judge, was appointed to the United States Supreme Court, in 1882, by President Chester Arthur, serving for 11 years until his death; he was the first person to serve at all three levels of the judiciary. Seward served as both Governor and Senator from New York, supported the 1865 passing of the Thirteenth Amendment, and negotiated the 1867 purchase of Alaska from Russia in a transaction that his opponents derisively called &quot;Seward&#x27;s Folly&quot; and &quot;Seward&#x27;s Icebox&quot;, though since noted as a &quot;bargain Basement deal&quot; that was the principal positive accomplishment of the Andrew Johnson presidency.

Paul Drennan Cravath joined the firm in 1899, and devised the &quot;Cravath System&quot;, combining a distinct method of hiring, training, and compensating lawyers. His name was added to the firm name in 1901 and, in 1944, after a series of name changes, the Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore name was established and has not been altered since.

Cravath has represented noted American inventors Samuel F.B. Morse, in the late 1840s; Cyrus McCormick, Elias Howe, and Charles Goodyear in the 1850s; and George Westinghouse in the 1880s. Some current client relationships that began in the 1800s are with CBS, JPMorgan, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The firm has had a long record of clients in the US railroad industry beginning with the New York &amp; Erie and Union Pacific railroads, and express delivery businesses such as Adams, Southern, and Wells Fargo. Its 19th-century history includes the 1808 insanity defense of William Freeman for the murder of John G. Van Nest, the 1848 &quot;Jones v. Van Zandt&quot; challenge to the constitutionality of slavery, and the &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan and Trust Company&quot; tax case of 1895. Cases of mention before the Supreme, appellate and Chancery courts in more recent decades have been &quot;Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,&quot; &quot;Westfed Holdings Inc. v. United States&quot;, and &quot;City of Providence v. First Citizens BancShares Inc. et al&quot;. Important litigation work with IBM has included two landmark antitrust cases, one of which was a 13-year battle dubbed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as “the case of the century.&quot;

The firm has represented entities in the United Kingdom and Europe since the 1820s from the Bank of England, to landmark public offerings by EU predecessors since the 1950s. HM Treasury, Grupo Modelo, Santander, and HDFC Bank are among more recent international clients. Cravath drew attention to its bankruptcy practice on November 10, 2010, by offering free representation in advance of a likely Chapter 9 filing for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The firm&#x27;s restructuring work traces back to clients such as Goodyear in 1921. After their 1916 reorganization of corporations lectures before the Bar of the City of New York, Paul D. Cravath and William D. Guthrie were reviewed to be &quot;men of wide experience in these matters,&quot; and several of their partners including Alexander I. Henderson and Robert T. Swaine &quot;ranked among the leaders of the reorganization bar.&quot;

In November 2014, Cravath handled three M&amp;A transactions in one day, spanning advertising, spirits, and pharmaceutical industries; and acted as legal advisor in a recently announced deal backed by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. that will create the third-largest food and beverage company in North America. Other significant representations have included legal work necessary to form NBC, United Airlines in its merger with Continental Airlines, the world&#x27;s largest airline, to Unilever in its acquisition of Alberto-Culver. In 2010, its litigation department won summary judgment for Morgan Stanley on its breach of contract claim against Discover Financial Services. In a subsequent settlement, Discover agreed to pay Morgan Stanley $775 million to resolve the litigation. In the same year they successfully represented Barnes &amp; Noble in a landmark &quot;poison pill&quot; trial. In the past several decades Cravath has represented Netscape in its antitrust suit against Microsoft, resulting in a $750 million settlement; major merger and acquisition deals, such as the DuPont-Conoco merger, the Ford-Jaguar merger, the Bristol-Myers-Squibb merger, the Time-Warner merger, and the AOL-Time-Warner merger; and two famed libel suits: defending Time Inc. against Israeli General Ariel Sharon, and also defending CBS against U.S. Army General William Westmoreland.

Unlike others, Cravath has remained a relatively small firm. Its approximately 500 lawyers are located primarily in the New York Office, with a few dozen in the London office, which opened in 1973 and Washington, DC launched in 2022. The firm opened a Hong Kong office in 1994, closing it nine years later.

In 2015, Cravath, Swaine and Moore was the victim of what the firm described as a &quot;limited breach&quot; of its computer network, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; connected to a 2016 court case against three Chinese hackers who had made more than $4 million from insider information about merger deals.

In March 2019, the New-York Historical Society Museum &amp; Library debuted an installation highlighting the firm, which illustrates legal milestones across two centuries, including obtaining patents for both the telegraph and the sewing machine, organizing NBC, and securing equal access to locker rooms for women sports reporters, exhibited &quot;through a collection of unique documents, photographs, and prints.&quot;

== Notable clients and cases ==
In 1848, the firm (then Seward &amp; Blatchford) brought the &quot;Jones v. Van Zandt&quot; challenge to the constitutionality of slavery.

In the early 1940s, the firm represented &quot;Esquire&quot; in &quot;Esquire v. Walker&quot;, later &quot;Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc.&quot;, at the U.S. Supreme Court, successfully fighting off the attempted censorship of its magazine by the two postmasters General in 1946.

In the 1960s, Cravath lawyers wrote the U.S. Supreme Court brief on behalf of the Congress of Racial Equality’s Freedom rides protesting segregated buses, and were called upon by President John F. Kennedy to help form the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

In 1966, the firm helped launch litigation that would become &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, which established that states cannot interrogate suspects without informing them of the right to counsel, now implemented as the Miranda warning issued by police to criminal suspects taken into custody.

In 1971, as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; prepared to publish the Pentagon Papers, Cravath reformed the publisher as a public company that was structured to protect editorial freedom.

In 1989, the firm argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of African American and women firefighters in Birmingham, Alabama. The case was a catalyst for the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Cravath concluded successful plaintiff representation in &quot;United States v. Jefferson County&quot; in December 2020.

During 2019 - 2021, Cravath represented Epic Games in &quot;Epic Games v. Apple,&quot; alleging anticompetitive behavior in the distribution of mobile apps and the processing of in-app purchases.

==Rankings and awards==
Based on a survey of law firm associate attorneys rating the reputations of firms other than their own, Cravath ranked as the #1 law firm in the United States in the annual &quot;Vault Law 100&quot;, in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and either #1 or #2 annually, since 2007. and the 2017 Above The Law Power 100 and Office 100. In 2016 Chambers and Partners ranked Cravath in the top tier among U.S. law firms for Banking &amp; Finance, Capital Markets (Debt &amp; Equity), Corporate/M&amp;A (The Elite), Environment (Mainly Transactional), Media &amp; Entertainment (Corporate), Securities Litigation, General Commercial Litigation (The Elite) and Tax.

Cravath was ranked 52 in The American Lawyer&#x27;s Am Law 200 in 2022, which lists the firm by revenue and profits per lawyer, compensation and other criteria.

==Hiring==

Under the Cravath System, the firm is known for focusing its hiring on associates straight from law school, with a strong emphasis on grades, then over years of apprenticeship rotations, immersing them in details of every aspect of corporate law practice. Under this philosophy, lateral hires are rare, with some exceptions. In 2005, Cravath hired Andrew W. Needham, formerly a tax partner at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, as the first lateral partner since Herbert L. Camp, also a tax partner, from the now-defunct Donovan Leisure Newton &amp; Irvine in 1987. Camp, however, had previously been a Cravath associate and may therefore be considered to not be a true lateral hire because he started his career there. Before that, Roswell Magill, a former Treasury Department official, became a Cravath tax partner in 1943. In 2007, the firm brought in Richard Levin from Skadden, Arps to boost its new bankruptcy practice. In 2011, Cravath hired Christine A. Varney, a former U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division for the Obama Administration. This was criticized as a revolving door case, as Cravath later had Varney represent AT&amp;T in its acquisition of Time Warner, which the Antitrust Division let pass. In 2013, the firm hired David Kappos, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

In addition, the system includes lockstep compensation on a published scale, which has tended to be consistent with the scale paid by most leading US law firms, and is known (for historical reasons) as the &quot;Cravath Scale&quot;.

In November 2023, amid a wave of antisemitic incidents at elite U.S. law schools, Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore was among a group of major law firms who sent a letter to top law school deans warning them that an escalation in incidents targeting Jewish students would have corporate hiring consequences. The letter said &quot;We look to you to ensure your students who hope to join our firms after graduation are prepared to be an active part of workplace communities that have zero tolerance policies for any form of discrimination or harassment, much less the kind that has been taking place on some law school campuses.&quot;

<text>James Joseph Dykes (November 10, 1896 – June 15, 1976) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a third and second baseman from through , most notably as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1929 to 1931 and, won the World Series in 1929 and 1930. Dykes played his final six seasons for the Chicago White Sox.

Dykes batted over .300 five times during his career and was a member of one of the most feared batting orders in the history of baseball, featuring three future Baseball Hall of Fame members (Al Simmons, Jimmie Foxx, and Mickey Cochrane). He also excelled as a defensive player, leading the American League in assists once at second base and twice at third base, ending his career sixth in AL history in games at third base (1,253), and seventh in putouts (1,361), assists (2,403), total chances (3,952) and double plays (199).

At the time of his retirement, Dykes ranked eighth in American League history in games played (2,282), and ninth in at bats (8,046). He holds the Athletics franchise record for career doubles (365), and formerly held team marks for career games and at bats.

After his playing career, Dykes became the winningest manager in Chicago White Sox history, with 899 victories over parts of 13 seasons, though his teams never finished above third place; he later became the first manager in history to win 1,000 games without capturing a league pennant. 

==Early career==
Born in Philadelphia, Dykes played for three local teams at age 16 in 1913. The first was &quot;his father&#x27;s Penn Street Boys Club&quot;; the second one paid 50 cents a game plus carfare (to Ardmore on the Main Line); the third paid $1 a game. By 19, Dykes played in the Delaware County League, which the major leagues declared an outlaw league a few years later, for infringing their control of the professional sport.

Dykes began his major league career on May 6, 1918, as a second baseman for the Athletics, and served in the wartime Army after the season ended. He spent most of 1919 in the minor leagues after reporting out of shape in spring training, but quickly became one of manager Connie Mack&#x27;s favorite players with his defensive versatility and easygoing manner, and remained with the club for the next 14 years, primarily at third base.

With powerful wrists and reputedly the sport&#x27;s best throwing arm, Dykes took advantage of Shibe Park&#x27;s friendly dimensions to finish among the league leaders in home runs in 1921 and 1922, and batted .312, .323, and .324 in 1924, 1925 and 1927. He was named team MVP in 1924 and placed eighth in the league MVP vote in 1927.

In one 1927 game, he played every position except catcher and left fielder, even appearing as a relief pitcher. In 1929, Dykes had a career-high .327 batting average and was ninth in the American League in slugging, helping the Athletics win their first American League pennant in 15 years by 18 games over the New York Yankees of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. He was one of six Athletics players to post batting averages above .310 during the 1929 season. Dykes capped the season by hitting .421 in the World Series against the Chicago Cubs; in Game 4, he had two hits and three runs batted in in a 10-run seventh inning as Philadelphia overcame an 8–0 deficit, and went on to win the Series in five games.

==Late career==
In 1930 Dykes batted .301 as the Athletics repeated as champions; in the 1930 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, he batted only .222, but drove in the winning run in Game 1 and had a 2-run home run in the final Game 6, a 7–1 victory.

In 1931, his batting average dropped to .273 as Philadelphia won its third straight pennant; but they lost their rematch with the Cardinals as he hit .227 in the 7-game Series.

Dykes had a disappointing year for the team in 1932 and with the onset of the Great Depression along with declining attendance, Connie Mack sought to reduce expenses by selling or trading his best players. In September 1932, he sold Dykes, Simmons and Mule Haas to the Chicago White Sox for $100,000 and a few months later sent Lefty Grove, Rube Walberg and Max Bishop to the Boston Red Sox for Bob Kline, Rabbit Warstler and $125,000. While with the White Sox, he was selected to the first two All-Star Games in 1933 and 1934.

In 22 seasons, Dykes was a career .280 hitter with 2,256 hits, 108 home runs, 1,108 runs and 1,069 RBI in 2,282 games, along with 453 doubles and 90 triples. His 115 times being hit by a pitch ranked second in AL history behind Kid Elberfeld&#x27;s 142, and his 850 strikeouts ranked fourth in major league history. He was the last active major leaguer who had played in the 1910s. His Athletics team records of 1,702 games and 6,023 at-bats were broken in the 1970s by Bert Campaneris after the franchise relocated to Oakland.

==Managerial career==
Early in the 1934 season, he succeeded Lew Fonseca as White Sox manager. He was the team&#x27;s player-manager until 1939. However, his last year as a full-time player was 1936; after that season, he only made cameo appearances in a total of 58 games. After formally retiring as a player in 1939, he continued as manager until early 1946. The White Sox finished in third place three times in his tenure. In 1936, they finished 81–70 (with two ties) while tied in percentage (.536) with the Washington Senators for third place. While they were 20 games behind the New York Yankees, it was the first time they had been a factor in a pennant race that late in any season since 1920, a year in which the team was decimated late in the season by the suspension (and eventual permanent banning from baseball) of the &quot;Black Sox.&quot; It was also only their third winning season since 1920.

His best finish with the White Sox was the 1937 season, when they finished with an 86–68 record, which was good for another third-place finish, 16 games behind the Yankees. They finished in third place in 1941 at 77–77 (with 2 ties) and 24 games back of the Yankees. The White Sox did not place as high as 3rd place again until 1952. The worst finish for the White Sox during his tenure was the 49–88 record in his first year; his 10–20 record during his last season in 1946 was his worst in terms of percentage.

As a manager, he proved more combative and argumentative than he had been as a player, and was often fined and suspended; his 62 ejections were among the all-time top ten when he retired. After Ted Lyons replaced him as White Sox manager, Dykes managed two years in the minor leagues with the White Sox&#x27; top minor league affiliate, the Hollywood Stars. He returned to the majors in 1949 as a coach with the Athletics. On May 26, 1950–one month into the season–he was promoted to assistant manager. It was also announced Mack would retire after the 1950 season after 50 years at the helm, and Dykes would succeed him for the 1951 season. However, Dykes essentially became the A&#x27;s de facto manager for the remainder of the 1950 season. He was given primary responsibility for day-to-day operations, took over as the team&#x27;s main game-day operator, and split control over most baseball matters with former teammate Mickey Cochrane, who became general manager. Although Mack, who by this time was now sole owner of the club, maintained his position as team president, he was now a figurehead. Dykes remained as manager until the end of the 1953 season. In his three seasons with the Athletics, the team finished 6th, 4th, and 7th, respectively. The 1952 season had them finish 79–75 (16 games behind the Yankees). It would be the franchise&#x27;s last .500 season until 1968.

Dykes was named the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; first manager in 1954 after that franchise relocated from St. Louis. In his only season with the team, he went 54–100 — the only 100 loss season in his managerial career. Dykes left in a team reorganization which ended with Paul Richards becoming both field and general manager in 1955. After 35 years in the American League, Dykes became a coach with the National League&#x27;s Cincinnati Redlegs, leading them as interim manager for the last 41 games of the 1958 season after Birdie Tebbetts was fired. However, he came back to the AL as manager of the Detroit Tigers in 1959. The Tigers team had lost 15 of their first 17 games under Bill Norman before being fired one month into the season at which Dykes was hired. His 1959 team went 74–63 (while finishing 76–78 overall), good for 4th place and 18 games behind his old White Sox team. He managed them to a 44–52 record in 1960. At that point, Frank Lane, then general manager of the Cleveland Indians and famous for his numerous transactions, sent Joe Gordon to Detroit and brought Dykes to Cleveland in a rare trade of managers. Dykes managed the Indians from 1960–1961. His teams went 26–32 and 77–83.

In 21 seasons as a manager, Dykes compiled a 1,406–1,541 record, never winning a pennant or finishing higher than third place. After serving as a coach for the Milwaukee Braves in 1962, he returned to the Athletics, who had by then moved to Kansas City, in 1963. He retired after the 1964 season, ending 47 years at field level in baseball. Although he had a different style of managing his teams, Dykes had authority, was testy and combative; he liked to make use of his entire roster and was regarded as a motivator of players.

Dykes co-authored the 1967 memoir &quot;You Can&#x27;t Steal First Base&quot; with Charles O. Dexter.

In a 1954 news story, Dykes was characterized as generally well liked by the players under him. &quot;He&#x27;s a pretty good guy,&quot; one Oriole said, &quot;he doesn&#x27;t say much but he knows how to put you straight when he has to.&quot; &quot;Everyone feels pretty good under him,&quot; another player said. &quot;You know he expects you to play ball but he doesn&#x27;t come around and bother you about it.&quot; Dykes was known as a practical jokester and was especially fond of exploding cigars which he passed out like candy. At one time he got confused when handing one to a sportswriter he knew, which exploded in his own face in front of the intended victim; &quot;got my hands crossed&quot;, Dykes explained.

When it came to the integration of baseball, Dykes had a mixed record. He recognized the talent of Jackie Robinson and other Black players, but was later recalled as having refused to pose with Robinson for a photograph, and was accused of calling for his pitcher to intentionally hit Minnie Miñoso, using a racial slur.

Dykes died in Philadelphia at age 79.

<text>The Mohave Valley is a valley located mostly on the east shore of the south-flowing Colorado River in northwest Arizona. The valley extends into California&#x27;s San Bernardino County; the northern side of the valley extends into extreme southeast Clark County, Nevada. The main part of the valley lies in southwest Mohave County, Arizona and is at the intersection of the southeast Mojave and northwest Sonoran deserts.

The valley extends into the three states of California, Arizona and Nevada, and the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation extends into them as well. On the west, the valley borders the Dead Mountains of California which overlook the tri-state intersection point.

Needles on Interstate 40 lies on the southwest margin of the valley overlooking the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge and Topock Marsh. The village of Topock is located at the south end of the valley where the Chemehuevi Mountains of California restrict the Colorado to the narrow Mohave Canyon.

==Mohave Valley==
Mohave Valley is a 25-mile (40 km) long, north-south trending valley and up to wide at some areas. Mohave Valley, Arizona, in the center of the reservation, is at the center point of the valley. Bullhead City is at the northern perimeter of the valley; Needles is on the southwest border of the valley in California. Downstream, and southeast, near the southern valley perimeter is the Topock Marsh in Arizona, and also on the southern perimeter, Interstate 40 in Arizona as it ascends uphill out of the Sacramento Wash, and eventually enters the entire north-south Sacramento Valley which lies on the east, southeast, and partial south of the Black Mountains.

&quot;Mohave Valley, Arizona&quot;, town center of the reservation, is located at ; the town center is at the valleys center, and slightly west, closer to the Colorado River, the valley&#x27;s west perimeter in many parts. The Boundary Cone landmark, lies east, at the northwest perimeter of the Black Mesa (western Arizona), a subsection mountain region at the southern end of the Black Mountains.

==Water and watersheds==
===Arizona, southeast &amp; east-(Sacramento Wash &amp; Valley)===
The southern end of the valley begins elevated regions, with the Mohave Mountains directly south, and Dutch Flat, east of the Mohave Mountains, which drains northwest into Sacramento Wash. The southeast of the valley meets the outfall of Sacramento Wash, and associated drainage plains; Sacramento Valley itself is mostly east and south of the Black Mesa section at the south of the Black Mountains (Arizona); the Sacramento Wash turns due west, and follows Interstate 40 in Arizona as it turns west and parallels the wash to meet Needles at the Colorado River; it is also the southern drainage outfall point into the Topock Marsh, at Topock, eastern shore of the Colorado River, in the southeast valley. Other washes drain through the eastern Mohave Valley plains and foothills into the Topock Marsh from the southwest of the Black Mountains, the extensive range which goes north to Lake Mead.

===Nevada, Piute Wash &amp; Valley-(northwest)===
While in Arizona the Sacramento Wash drains the Sacramento Valley southwest of Kingman, in Nevada the Piute Wash drains the Piute Valley of southeast Nevada. A separate drainage lies between them on the Colorado River, the &quot;Havasu-Mohave Lakes Drainage&quot;. These three drainages, the west, center, and east all drain into the Mohave Valley region.

<text>Shortest seek first (or shortest seek time first) is a secondary storage scheduling algorithm to determine the motion of the disk read-and-write head in servicing read and write requests.

== Description ==

This is an alternative to the first-come first-served (FCFS) algorithm. The drive maintains an incoming buffer of requests, and tied with each request is a cylinder number of the request. Lower cylinder numbers indicate the cylinder is closer to the spindle, while higher numbers indicate the cylinder is further away. The shortest seek first algorithm determines which request is closest to the current position of the head, and services that request next.

== Analysis ==

The shortest seek first algorithm has the benefit of simplicity, in that overall arm movement is reduced, resulting in a lower average response time.

However, since the buffer is always getting new requests, these can skew the service time of requests that may be furthest away from the disk head&#x27;s current location, if the new requests are all close to the current location; in fact, starvation may result, with the faraway requests never being able to make progress.

The elevator algorithm is one alternative for reducing arm movement and response time, and ensuring consistent servicing of requests.

<doc id="1206956" wikidata="Q898539" url="?curid=1206956" title="Lipid peroxidation">
<text>Lipid peroxidation, or lipid oxidation, is a complex chemical process that leads to oxidative degradation of lipids, resulting in the formation of peroxide and hydroperoxide derivatives. It occurs when free radicals, specifically reactive oxygen species (ROS), interact with lipids within cell membranes, typically polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as they have carbon–carbon double bonds. This reaction leads to the formation of lipid radicals, collectively referred to as lipid peroxides or lipid oxidation products (LOPs), which in turn react with other oxidizing agents, leading to a chain reaction that results in oxidative stress and cell damage.

In pathology and medicine, lipid peroxidation plays a role in cell damage which has broadly been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases and disease states, including ageing, whereas in food science lipid peroxidation is one of many pathways to rancidity.

==Reaction mechanism==

The chemical reaction of lipid peroxidation consists of three phases: &quot;initiation&quot;, &quot;propagation&quot;, and &quot;termination&quot;.

In the &quot;initiation&quot; phase, a pro-oxidant hydroxyl radical ({{chem2|OH•}}) abstracts the hydrogen at the allylic position (–CH2–CH=CH2) or methine bridge (=CH−){{Clarification needed|reason=Is a methine bridge synonymous here with the bis-allylic or allylic position?|date=March 2024}} on the stable lipid substrate, typically a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), to form the lipid radical ({{Chem2|L•}}) and water (H2O).

In the &quot;propagation&quot; phase, the lipid radical ({{Chem2|L•}}) reacts with molecular oxygen ({{Chem2|O2}}) to form a lipid hydroperoxyl radical ({{Chem2|LOO•}}). The lipid hydroperoxyl radical ({{Chem2|LOO•}}) can further abstract hydrogen from a new PUFA substrate, forming another lipid radical ({{Chem2|L•}}) and now finally a lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH). 

The lipid hydroperoxyl radical ({{Chem2|LOO•}}) can also undergo a variety of reactions to produce new radicals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The additional lipid radical ({{Chem2|L•}}) continues the chain reaction, whilst the lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) is the primary end product. The formation of lipid radicals is sensitive to the kinetic isotope effect. Reinforced lipids in the membrane can suppress the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation.

The &quot;termination&quot; step can vary, in both its actual chemical reaction and when it will occur. Lipid peroxidation is a self-propagating chain reaction and will proceed until the lipid substrate is consumed and the last two remaining radicals combine, or a reaction which terminates it occurs. Termination can occur when two lipid hydroperoxyl radicals ({{Chem2|LOO•}}) react to form peroxide and oxygen (O2).{{Clarification needed|reason=True?|date=March 2024}} Termination can also occur when the concentration of radical species is high.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The primary products of lipid peroxidation are lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH).
=== Arachidonic acid as a substrate ===
When arachidonic acid is a substrate, isomers of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETEs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are formed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

==Role of antioxidants==
{{Main|Antioxidants}}
Antioxidants play a crucial role in mitigating lipid peroxidation by neutralizing free radicals, thereby halting radical chain reactions. Key antioxidants include vitamin C and vitamin E. Additionally, enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase contribute to the oxidation response by reducing the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which is a prevalent precursor of the hydroxyl radical ({{chem2|OH•}}).

As an example, vitamin E can donate a hydrogen atom to the lipid hydroperoxyl radical ({{Chem2|LOO•}}) to form a vitamin E radical, which further reacts with another lipid hydroperoxyl radical ({{Chem2|LOO•}}) forming non-radical products. 

== Medical implications ==
Phototherapy may cause lipid peroxidation, leading to the rupture of red blood cell cell membranes.

End-products of lipid peroxidation may be mutagenic and carcinogenic. For instance, the end-product MDA reacts with deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine in DNA, forming DNA adducts to them, primarily M1G.

Reactive aldehydes can also form Michael adducts or Schiff bases with thiol or amine groups in amino acid side chains. Thus, they are able to inactivate sensitive proteins through electrophilic stress.

The toxicity of lipid hydroperoxides to animals is best illustrated by the lethal phenotype of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) knockout mice. These animals do not survive past embryonic day 8, indicating that the removal of lipid hydroperoxides is essential for mammalian life.

It is unclear whether dietary lipid peroxides are bioavailable and play a role in disease, as a healthy human body has protective mechanisms in place against such hazards.

== Tests ==
Certain diagnostic tests are available for the quantification of the end-products of lipid peroxidation, to be specific, malondialdehyde (MDA). The most commonly used test is called a TBARS Assay (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay). Thiobarbituric acid reacts with malondialdehyde to yield a fluorescent product. However, there are other sources of malondialdehyde, so this test is not completely specific for lipid peroxidation.

<text>Ben Hur Lampman (August 12, 1886 – January 24, 1954) was an American newspaper editor, essayist, short story writer, and poet. He was a longtime associate editor at &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in Portland, Oregon, and he served as Poet laureate of Oregon from 1951 until his death.

==Early life==
Ben Lampman was born on August 12, 1886, in Barron, Wisconsin. His father, H. H. Lampman, owned a newspaper in Barron. The family moved to Neche, North Dakota, when Ben was 4 years old, and his father founded another newspaper in Neche after arriving there. As a boy, he worked in his father&#x27;s print shop. He left home at age 15 and worked in the wheat country of Canada. He returned to North Dakota. At the age of 19, he married Lena Sheldon (his same age), a New York City resident who had moved to the Dakotas to become a school teacher. They remained married for the remainder of his life. His brother Rex Lampman was a columnist for the &quot;Oregon Journal&quot; and, later, the &quot;Pittsburg Leader&quot;.

==Career==
His first work in newspaper writing took place when he was 19 years old (1905 or 1906), when he and another young man co-founded the &quot;Michigan City Arena&quot;, a newspaper in Michigan City, North Dakota. He worked on the &quot;Arena&quot; for seven years, writing editorials and columns and helping to manage the business. 
In 1912, Lampman moved from North Dakota to Oregon to become manager and publisher of the &quot;Gold Hill News&quot;, a weekly newspaper in Gold Hill, Oregon. His writing caught the attention of Paul Kelty, then the news editor of Portland&#x27;s &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, who recommended Lampman to editor-in-chief Edgar B. Piper. He was hired, moved to Portland, and began working for &quot;The Oregonian&quot; on February 1, 1916. For his first 14 months at the paper, he covered police-related news, but also wrote editorials from time to time. In 1920, he published an account of the 1919 Centralia Massacre. In additional to part-time editorial writing, he worked as a reporter and feature writer for &quot;The Oregonian&quot; until 1922, when the paper made him a full-time editorial writer and an associate editor. He also wrote nature essays in &quot;The Oregonian&quot;.

His stories and essays also appeared in national magazines such as the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Some of his essays about life in Portland were collected in his 1942 book &quot;At the End of the Car Line&quot;. In 1943 he won an O. Henry Award for his short story &quot;Blinker Was a Good Dog&quot; which originally appeared in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Some of his papers and manuscripts are now in the collection of the library of the University of Oregon. Others reside at Lewis and Clark College and the Oregon Historical Society. The Lewis and Clark Collection also contains, on loan, from the family of Ben&#x27;s long-time friend, Elizabeth Salway Ryan, Ben&#x27;s typewriter, his trademark glasses, a complete set of proofs of all 14 of his books and many more items.

Lampman also wrote a column in &quot;The Oregonian&quot; entitled &quot;Where to Bury A Dog&quot; which is frequently cited in pet memorials. It was included in &quot;How Could I Be Forgetting&quot;, a 1926 compilation of the author&#x27;s essays and poems. In total, he authored six books.

Lampman was still an associate editor at &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in early 1951, when a stroke took him off the job, eventually leading to retirement. He was named poet laureate of Oregon on February 20, 1951.

In the 1980s, Elizabeth Salway Ryan wrote a biography, The Magic of Ben Hur Lampman. The typescript was published in a very limited edition by Grandson Mark Anders Kronquist and Daughter Sally Ryan Tomlinson. Copies of the first edition typescript are in the collections of the University of Oregon, The Lake Oswego Public Library, the Library of Congress and the Oregon Historical Society. In 2011, as a part of the celebration, Lewis and Clark College printed several hundred copies of the typescript.

==Family==
As of the 1930 U.S. Census, he and his wife, Lena, had one son and two daughters: Herbert Lampman, Caroline S. Lampman, and Hope H. Lampman. Son Herbert Sheldon Lampman (March 18, 1907 – June 30, 1943), a naturalist, also became a writer and journalist, and was &quot;The Oregonian&quot; wildlife editor and one of its feature writers for about 12 years until his death in 1943 at the age of just 36.

==Death==
Lampman died in Portland on January 24, 1954. He had been in a nursing home for the last two years of his life, following a series of cerebral hemorrhages. He is buried in Lincoln Memorial Park in Portland.

<text>The Mohocks were allegedly a gang of violent, well-born criminals that terrorized London during the early 18th century, attacking men and women alike, and taking their name from the Mohawks. Their activities, which were perhaps sensationalized, were said to include murder. The matter ended in 1712 when a bounty of £100 was issued by the royal court for their capture.

According to Lady Wentworth, &quot;They put an old woman into a hogshead, and rolled her down a hill; they cut off some noses, others&#x27; hands, and several barbarous tricks, without any provocation. They are said to be young gentlemen; they never take any money from any.&quot; (Wentworth Papers, 277)

Historians have found little evidence of any organized gang, though in spring 1712 there was a flurry of print accounts of the Mohocks, their lawlessness, impunity and luridly violent acts. In response there was also some derision from satirists at what they perceived to be sensationalism by the Grub Street press. John Gay&#x27;s first drama, &quot;The Mohocks&quot;, was written that year but was not performed for political reasons. It was, however, published as a pseudonymous pamphlet.

In 18th century London, the name &quot;Mohawks&quot; was subsequently applied to other upper-class drunken rowdies and bravos. William Hickey recalled &quot;In the winter of 1771, a set of wild young men made their appearance, who, from the profligacy of their manners and their outrageous conduct in the theatres, taverns, and coffee houses in the vicinity of Covent Garden, created general indignation and alarm... They were distinguished under the title of Mohawks.&quot; Hickey identified their boss as Rhoan Hamilton, &quot;a man of fortune&quot; and later an Irish rebel, and Messrs Hayter, son of a bank director, Osborne, an American, and &quot;Capt.&quot; Frederick.
Various other gangs of street bullies are alleged to have terrorized London at different periods, beginning during the 1590s with the Damned Crew and continuing after the Restoration with the Muns, the Tityré Tūs, the Hectors, the Scourers, the Nickers, and the Hawkubites.

In the Victor Hugo novel, The man who Laughs, Hugo writes &quot;The most fashionable of the clubs was presided over by an emperor, who wore a crescent on his forehead, and was called the Grand Mohawk. The Mohawk surpassed the Fun. Do evil for evil&#x27;s sake was the programme. The Mohawk Club had one great object--to injure. To fulfil this duty all means were held good. In becoming a Mohawk the members took an oath to be hurtful. To injure at any price, no matter when, no matter whom, no matter where, was a matter of duty. Every member of the Mohawk Club was bound to possess an accomplishment. One was &quot;a dancing master;&quot; that is to say he made the rustics frisk about by pricking the calves of their legs with the point of his sword. Others knew how to make a man sweat; That is to say, a circle of gentlemen with drawn rapiers would surround a poor wretch, so that it was impossible for him not to turn his back upon some one. The gentleman behind him chastised him for this by a prick of his sword, which made him spring round; another prick in the back warned the fellow that one of noble blood was behind him, and so on, each one wounding him in his turn. When the man, closed round by the circle of swords and covered with blood, had turned and danced about enough, they ordered their servants to beat him with sticks, to change the course of his ideas. Others &quot;hit the lion&quot;--that is, they gaily stopped a passenger, broke his nose with a blow of the fist, and then shoved both thumbs into his eyes. If his eyes were gouged out, he was paid for them. Such were, towards the beginning of the eighteenth century, the pastimes of the rich idlers of London.&quot;

<text>Larrousse Formula One was a motorsports racing team founded in 1987 by Didier Calmels and former racer Gérard Larrousse, originally under the name Larrousse &amp; Calmels. It was based in Antony, in the southern suburbs of Paris. It was renamed Larrousse after the departure of Calmels following his murder of his wife. The team competed in Formula One from to before succumbing to financial problems, scoring a best finish of third at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix during this time.

==Formula One==

===Lola chassis (1987–1991)===
Larrousse &amp; Calmels commissioned a car from Lola and the result was the LC87 (internal Lola designation: T87/30), a car designed by Eric Broadley and Ralph Bellamy. The chassis was powered by a Cosworth DFZ V8 engine, and was entered in the undersubscribed normally aspirated class.

The team started out in with just one car for Philippe Alliot, with Yannick Dalmas joining the team in a second car the end of the year. By that time they had agreed to a three-year deal with Lola and Chris Murphy was recruited from Zakspeed to help Bellamy. The team then made a deal to run Lamborghini V12 engines in 1989.

In September 1988 the team hired former Renault and Lotus designer and engineer Gérard Ducarouge but in the spring of 1989, Calmels had to quit the team due to his imprisonment for the murder of his wife. As a result, the team became known simply as Larrousse.

For the season Alliot stayed on but Dalmas, who had been ill with Legionnaires&#x27; disease, was dropped after Canada and replaced by rookie French driver Éric Bernard and later by Michele Alboreto, who had recently left Tyrrell. At the end of the year, Larrousse sold 50% of his shares to the Japanese Espo Corporation, and Aguri Suzuki was hired to partner Bernard for the 1990 season. At the same time the team moved from Antony to new premises at Signes in the south of France near the Paul Ricard Circuit.

The season was Larrousse&#x27;s best in Formula One, despite being forced to pre-qualify for the first half of the season. Suzuki managed to score the team&#x27;s first, and ultimately only, podium, in front of his home fans at Suzuka in the Japanese Grand Prix, and the team finished sixth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Then things began to unravel when Lamborghini announced it was switching to Ligier. Of greater concern was the FIA considering taking away Larrousse&#x27;s points because of an alleged &quot;false declaration&quot; about the design of the chassis. It transpired the team had made an honest mistake by registering the car as manufactured by themselves, when in fact it was designed and built by Lola in England. Although the team officially lost their points from 1990, the team kept the travel benefits and prize money associated with their championship finish and did not have to take part in pre-qualifying.

Larrousse signed an engine deal with Brian Hart for 1991 but early in the year Espo withdrew and the team struggled financially. Although difficult to set up, the car proved relatively quick and was usually a solid midfield runner before succumbing to the inevitable breakdown or driver error. Suzuki finished sixth in the first race of the season at Phoenix, and thereafter never made the chequered flag again. Bernard earned a single point for 6th at the Mexican Grand Prix. He crashed heavily in qualifying in Japan at Suzuka&#x27;s hairpin, badly breaking his leg, and putting him out of F1 until he returned with Ligier in . Belgian Bertrand Gachot returned for the final race in Australia (after being released from jail for assault on a London taxi driver).

As the funds began to run dry, the team sought protection from creditors with a French court in July. Japanese company Central Park bought into the team but soon afterwards Ducarouge left. Merger talks with AGS failed and the relationships with Lola and Hart were both ended without payment being made by Larrousse.

===Venturi chassis (1992)===
In the autumn of 1991 Gérard Larrousse signed up Robin Herd from Fondmetal for the construction of an F1 chassis and 65% of the team was sold to the Venturi car company. A new Lamborghini engine deal was agreed and Bertrand Gachot was kept on alongside Ukyo Katayama. In a season dominated by the Williams team, Gachot scored Larrousse&#x27;s only point of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix. Gachot and Katayama collided twice in the season, in Canada and then Japan.

In September 1992 Venturi sold its shareholding to a group called Comstock, headed by German Rainer Walldorf. Walldorf, real name Klaus Walz, turned out to be wanted by the police of several European countries in connection with four murders. After escaping from a raid on his house in France by judicious use of a hand grenade, he was killed during a nine-hour gun battle with police in a German hotel.

===Larrousse chassis (1993–1994)===
In the team&#x27;s first season using an in-house chassis, they had another disappointing season in 1993 when Gérard Larrousse funded drivers Philippe Alliot and Érik Comas, and the drivers could only manage two finishes in the points. Japanese pay driver Toshio Suzuki substituted for Alliot in hopes of increasing finances for the flyaway end of season races in Japan and Australia.

In 1994 Larrousse reorganized the team again. With Lamborghini pulling out and a failure to agree a deal to use Peugeot engines (which went to McLaren) he reverted to customer Ford HB engines, which were a substantially lesser predecessor to the Ford Zetec-R used by the works Benetton team. New partners were brought in, in the form of Swiss-based Fast Group SA, an organization headed by Ferrari dealer Michel Golay and former F1 racer Patrick Tambay. Sponsorship was found from the Belgian Alken-Maes brewery (with Rizla, SEITA and Zanussi filling the secondary sponsor roles), and the cars primarily ran in the colors of alcohol-free beer Tourtel, with occasional uses of the red and white colors of Kronenbourg in selected Grands Prix. At the wheel, Olivier Beretta replaced Alliot while Comas remained. Reliability was generally very poor throughout the season. Comas scored two 6th placings in the Pacific and German GPs – the latter race had only 8 finishers after a huge start-line accident. Beretta&#x27;s best result was 7th at the German GP as well.

Despite these occasional flashes of speed, Comas and Beretta generally ran in the lower-midfield in what proved to be a tricky car powered by an aging engine. As the money ran short, however, pay-drivers replaced them, including former Larrousse veterans Alliot and Dalmas, as well as rookies Hideki Noda and Jean-Denis Délétraz.

During the season, the team played a role in Benetton Formula&#x27;s cheating allegations. In May that year, the team was asked by refuelling rig device manufacturer Intertechnique to remove a fuel filter from their refuelling device; the team notified the FIA about the request the night before an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in September regarding Jos Verstappen&#x27;s refuelling fire at German Grand Prix, where Benetton did the same without Intertechnique&#x27;s approval.

===Collapse===
A new F1 car for was designed by Robin Herd, but was not built due to lack of funds. The team appeared on the entry list for the 1995 season with Érik Comas returning as one of its drivers, but needed to merge with an organisation with an available F1 chassis to survive. The two options were Lola, which was unrealistic as the British manufacturer had never been paid by Larrousse for the chassis it had produced for the and seasons; and French International Formula 3000 team DAMS, which was in possession of a Reynard-designed F1 chassis with which it hoped to enter the sport in the future. However, Gérard Larrousse and DAMS owner Jean-Paul Driot failed to come to an agreement over the winter of 1994–1995. Driot subsequently announced that DAMS would not enter F1 in 1995. Larrousse consequently ordered the previous year&#x27;s chassis, the LH94, to be upgraded to the new technical regulations as a temporary solution, whilst he waited to see if the French government would give the team financial support, as way of compensation for the fact that the so-called &quot;Evin&#x27;s Law&quot; had banned possible revenue from tobacco and alcohol sponsorship. In the meantime he sold the majority stake in the Larrousse outfit to compatriots Laurent Barlesi and Jean Messaoudi, who had attempted but failed to enter their own planned Junior F1 Team for the coming season and had the budget necessary to save Larrousse from imminent collapse. During this period, the team&#x27;s potential driver line-up was in flux, with Comas, Emmanuel Collard, Elton Julian, Éric Hélary, Christophe Bouchut and Éric Bernard all in the frame.

It was then announced within two weeks of the season-opening Brazilian Grand Prix that Larrousse would not receive any government money. The team elected to miss the first two long-haul races of the season, reasoning that it was better to focus on building a new car than upgrading the old one (a solution that would be very uncompetitive), and hoping that the sport&#x27;s governing body, Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) would waive the standard fines levied against teams that missed Grands Prix in the interest of keeping the team in F1. However, the team&#x27;s situation remained extremely difficult: Ford refused to supply the team engines without payment; Gérard Larrousse&#x27;s former partners, Patrick Tambay and Michel Golay, took legal action against him in France; and a planned sponsorship deal with Petronas was dependent on the team taking part in a Grand Prix. Prior to the San Marino Grand Prix, Larrousse announced his team&#x27;s withdrawal from F1, blaming others for failing to produce promised funding. Despite announcing that he intended to return to the sport for , his involvement in several lawsuits as a result of the team&#x27;s collapse made this impossible. The failure of Larrousse was a blow to French motorsport, which in addition to the problems caused by the government&#x27;s ban on tobacco and alcohol sponsorship (the Loi Evin), had recently lost the AGS team in and seen the takeover of the Ligier team by foreigners Flavio Briatore and Tom Walkinshaw in .

<doc id="1206990" wikidata="Q988829" url="?curid=1206990" title="Elevator algorithm">
<text>The elevator algorithm, or SCAN, is a disk-scheduling algorithm to determine the motion of the disk&#x27;s arm and head in servicing read and write requests.

This algorithm is named after the behavior of a building elevator, where the elevator continues to travel in its current direction (up or down) until empty, stopping only to let individuals off or to pick up new individuals heading in the same direction. 

From an implementation perspective, the drive maintains a buffer of pending read/write requests, along with the associated cylinder number of the request, in which lower cylinder numbers generally indicate that the cylinder is closer to the spindle, and higher numbers indicate the cylinder is farther away.

== Description ==

When a new request arrives while the drive is idle, the initial arm/head movement will be in the direction of the cylinder where the data is stored, either &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot;. As additional requests arrive, requests are serviced only in the current direction of arm movement until the arm reaches the edge of the disk. When this happens, the direction of the arm reverses, and the requests that were remaining in the opposite direction are serviced, and so on.

== Variations ==
One variation of this method ensures all requests are serviced in only one direction, that is, once the head has arrived at the outer edge of the disk, it returns to the beginning and services the new requests in this one direction only (or vice versa). This is known as the &quot;Circular Elevator Algorithm&quot; or C-SCAN. Although the time of the return seek is wasted, this results in more equal performance for all head positions, as the expected distance from the head is always half the maximum distance, unlike in the standard elevator algorithm where cylinders in the middle will be serviced as much as twice as often as the innermost or outermost cylinders.

Other variations include:
* FSCAN
* LOOK
** C-LOOK
* N-Step-SCAN
== Example ==
The following is an example of how to calculate average disk seek times for both the SCAN and C-SCAN algorithms.

* Example list of pending disk requests (listed by track number): 100, 50, 10, 20, 75.
* The starting track number for the examples will be 35.
* The list will need to be sorted in ascending order: 10, 20, 50, 75, 100.

Both SCAN and C-SCAN behave in the same manner until they reach the last track queued. For the sake of this example let us assume that the SCAN algorithm is currently going from a lower track number to a higher track number (like the C-SCAN is doing). For both methods, one takes the difference in magnitude (i.e. absolute value) between the next track request and the current track.

* Seek 1: 50 − 35 = 15
* Seek 2: 75 − 50 = 25
* Seek 3: 100 − 75 = 25

At this point both have reached the highest (end) track request. SCAN will just reverse direction and service the next closest disk request (in this example, 20) and C-SCAN will always go back to track 0 and start going to higher track requests.

* Seek 4 (SCAN): 20 − 100 = 80
* Seek 5 (SCAN): 10 − 20 = 10
* Total (SCAN): 155
* Average (SCAN): 155 ÷ 5 = 31
* Seek 4 (C-SCAN): 0 − 100 = 0 head movement as cylinders are treated as a circular list (C-SCAN always goes back to the first track)
* Seek 5 (C-SCAN): 10 − 0 = 10
* Seek 6 (C-SCAN): 20 − 10 = 10
* Total (C-SCAN): 85
* Average (C-SCAN): 85 ÷ 5 = 17

Even though six seeks were performed using the C-SCAN algorithm, only five I/Os were actually done.

The scan algorithm (often known as prefix sum algorithm) is commonly used in computer science for problems that involve computing the cumulative sum or the cumulative result of a series of elements in an array or list. It operates by iterating through the list and maintaining an accumulated result up to the current element, and can be used in various scenarios such as parallel computation, reducing operations, or processing large data efficiently.

Here’s a real-world example where the scan algorithm is applied:

Example: Real-Time Data Processing in Stock Market Analysis
Imagine a financial trading application that tracks the price changes of a stock over time and calculates the cumulative value or gain/loss of the stock at any given moment.

Scenario:
You have a list of daily stock price changes (positive or negative values) for a particular stock over a period of days. The scan algorithm can be used to calculate the cumulative gain or loss at each day, showing the total change in stock price from the start up to that day.

Input data: A list of daily stock price changes:

Copy code
[10, -5, 3, 7, -2]
Where:

10 represents a gain of $10 on day 1,
-5 represents a loss of $5 on day 2,
3 represents a gain of $3 on day 3,
7 represents a gain of $7 on day 4,
-2 represents a loss of $2 on day 5.
Step-by-Step Execution (Scan Algorithm):

Start with an initial cumulative sum of 0.
For each subsequent day, add the day&#x27;s change to the cumulative sum:
Day 1: 0 + 10 = 10 (Total gain so far: $10)
Day 2: 10 + (-5) = 5 (Total gain so far: $5)
Day 3: 5 + 3 = 8 (Total gain so far: $8)
Day 4: 8 + 7 = 15 (Total gain so far: $15)
Day 5: 15 + (-2) = 13 (Total gain so far: $13)
Output: The cumulative gains after each day:

This cumulative list shows how the stock has performed in terms of total gain/loss at each day in the period. By using the scan algorithm, you efficiently compute these cumulative results in a single pass over the data.

Parallelism and Optimization:
In a real-world application where the data set is large (e.g., tracking stock prices across thousands of days for multiple stocks), this scan algorithm can be parallelized to run faster. For example, using techniques like parallel prefix sum (where the input array is divided into chunks, processed in parallel, and then merged), large-scale data can be processed much more efficiently.

Use Cases Beyond Stock Market Analysis:
Image Processing: Cumulative operations (like pixel intensities) for tasks such as convolution or blur filters.
Distributed Systems: Aggregating values across multiple nodes to compute cumulative statistics.
Database Systems: Efficiently computing running totals in financial applications or analytics.
The scan algorithm is essential in scenarios where you need to process or aggregate data in a way that builds on prior computations, and its parallel implementation helps in scaling up for larger datasets.

== Analysis ==
For both versions of the elevator algorithm, the arm movement is less than twice the number of total cylinders and produces a smaller variance in response time. The algorithm is also relatively simple. 

The elevator algorithm is not always better than shortest seek first, which is slightly closer to optimal, but can result in high variance in response time and even in starvation when new requests continually get serviced prior to existing requests. Anti-starvation techniques can be applied to the shortest seek time first algorithm to guarantee a maximum response time.

<text>The Larch Prover, or LP for short, is an interactive theorem proving system for multi-sorted first-order logic. It was used at MIT and elsewhere during the 1990s to reason about designs for circuits, concurrent algorithms, hardware, and software. 

Unlike most theorem provers, which attempt to find proofs automatically for correctly stated conjectures, LP was intended to assist users in finding and correcting flaws in conjectures—the predominant activity in the early stages of the design process. It worked efficiently on large problems, had many important user amenities, and could be used by relatively naïve users.

==Development==

LP was developed by Stephen Garland and John Guttag at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science with assistance from James Horning and James Saxe at the DEC Systems Research Center, as part of the Larch project on formal specifications. It extended the REVE 2 equational term rewriting system developed by Pierre Lescanne, Randy Forgaard with assistance from David Detlefs and Katherine Yelick. It supports proofs by equational term rewriting (for terms with associative-commutative operators), cases, contradiction, induction, generalization, and specialization.

LP was written in the CLU programming language.

<text>Moses Lake is a lake and reservoir along the course of Crab Creek, in the U.S. state of Washington.

Moses Lake is part of the Columbia River basin, as Crab Creek is a tributary of the Columbia River.

Although originally a shallow natural lake, Moses Lake was dammed in the early 20th century for irrigation purposes. It then became part of the Columbia Basin Project, built and managed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Moses Lake receives water from Crab Creek, as well as from irrigated agricultural runoff. Its water used to flow out into Crab Creek, but now flows into Potholes Reservoir, a storage reservoir created by impounding Crab Creek at O&#x27;Sullivan Dam.

Moses Lake is fairly complex in shape, with several arms, called &quot;horns&quot;. These horns include Lewis Horn, Parker Horn, and Pelican Horn. There are several islands in Moses Lake, including Crest Island, Marsh Island, Gaileys Island, and Goat Island.

Moses Lake was named after Chief Moses in the late 19th century. The city of Moses Lake was, in turn, named after the lake.

The city of Moses Lake was originally named Neppel, and was not changed to Moses Lake until 1938.

<doc id="1207021" wikidata="Q2126654" url="?curid=1207021" title="Cornelia (wife of Livianus)">
<text>Cornelia Sulla or Cornelia Silla was the eldest daughter of the Roman statesman and general Lucius Cornelius Sulla and his first wife Julia.

==Biography==
===Early life===
It is believed that she was Sulla&#x27;s daughter by his first wife Julia. She likely had a full brother named Lucius Cornelius Sulla who died young. Her mother died while she was young, and her father would remarry four times, from these marriages Cornelia had three siblings; Faustus Cornelius Sulla, Fausta Cornelia and Cornelia Postuma.

===Marriages===
Cornelia married Quintus Pompeius Rufus, the son of Sulla&#x27;s consular colleague in 88 BC, Quintus Pompeius Rufus. The marriage produced two children, Pompeia (who became Julius Caesar&#x27;s second or third wife) and Quintus Pompeius Rufus. Her husband was killed during a riot led by the tribune Publius Sulpicius Rufus in 88 BC. She remarried Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, who became consul in 77 BC, a year after the death of Sulla.

Violent upheavals soon ensued out of the ongoing rivalry between Sulla and his former mentor the ageing Gaius Marius. In 86 BC, while Sulla was in Asia Minor pursuing his war against King Mithridates VI of Pontus, he was stripped of his &quot;imperium&quot; by Marius and his colleagues, and forced into exile.

Cornelia and her new husband took rapid steps to safeguard Sulla&#x27;s estates from the resulting mock trials and proscriptions during Marius&#x27;s seventh consulship. She then joined her father in exile.

Cornelia appears in Colleen McCullough&#x27;s series, &quot;Masters of Rome&quot;.

<text>Xikang (formerly romanized as Sikang or Hsikang, or &#x27;Kham to the west [of Sichuan]&#x27;) was a nominal province
formed by the Republic of China in 1939 on the initiative of prominent Sichuan warlord Liu Wenhui and retained by the early People&#x27;s Republic of China. The former territory of Xikang is now divided between the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Sichuan province. 

The idea behind Xikang province was to form a single unified province for the entire Kham region under direct Chinese administration, in effect annexing the western Kham region that was then under Tibetan control. Kham was entirely populated by Tibetan people called Khampas. The then-independent Tibet controlled the portion of Kham west of the Upper Yangtze River.
The nominal Xikang province also included in the south the Assam Himalayan region (Arunachal Pradesh) that Tibet had recognised as a part of British India by the 1914 McMahon Line agreement.
The eastern part of the province was inhabited by a number of different ethnic groups, such as Han Chinese, Yi, Qiang people and Tibetan, then known as &quot;Chuanbian&quot; (), a special administrative region of the Republic of China. In 1939, it became the new Xikang province with the additional territories belonging to Tibetan and British control added in. It was taken over by Chinese communist forces in 1949.

The provincial capital of Xikang was Kangding from 1939 to 1951 and Ya&#x27;an from 1951 to 1955. The province had a population of 3.4 million in 1954. In 1955, its eastern half was merged into Sichuan, and its western half came under the administration of the TAR preparatory committee. 

== Overview ==
The idea of &quot;Xikang&quot; was to construct an independent province of China for the entire Kham region, which would be separate from Tibet as well as Sichuan. Even though it was defined in regulations and sketched out on maps, only the eastern Kham region was ever under the control of the Republic of China.

== History ==

Following the 1905 Batang uprising, Qing China appointed Zhao Erfeng as the Imperial Commissioner for the Sichuan-Yunnan Frontier. Zhao reduced all the autonomous native states in both the western and eastern Kham by 1910 and converted them into Chinese districts governed by magistrates. He signed an agreement with the Tibetan government setting the border between China and Tibet at Gyamda. This paved the way for the formation of a Xikang province, proposed by Zhang&#x27;s successor Fu Songmu.

Following the Wuchang Uprising in October 1911, which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty, the region subdued by Frontier Commissioners was established as the Chuanbian Special Administrative District () by the newly founded Republic of China.

In June 1930, eastern Kham (later Xikang) was invaded by the army of Tibet, precipitating the Sino-Tibetan War. With the district locked in internal struggles, no reinforcements were sent to support the Sichuanese troops stationed here. As a result, the Tibetan army captured Garzê and Xinlong Counties without encountering much resistance. When a negotiated ceasefire failed, Tibetan forces expanded the war, attempting to capture parts of southern Qinghai province. In March 1932, their force invaded Qinghai but was defeated by the local Hui warlord Ma Bufang in July, who routed the Tibetan army and drove it back to this district.

The Hui army captured counties that had fallen into the hands of the Tibetan army since 1919. Their victories threatened the supply lines of the Tibetan forces in Garzê and Xinlong. As a result, part of the Tibetan army was forced to withdraw.

In 1932 Liu Wenhui in cooperation with the Qinghai army, sent out a brigade to attack the Tibetan troops in Garzê and Xinlong, eventually occupying them, Dêgê and other counties east of the Jinshajiang River. The 1934 Khamba Rebellion led by the Pandatsang family broke out against the Tibetan government in Lhasa. The Khampa revolutionary leader Pandatsang Rapga was involved.

In January 1939, the &quot;Chuanbian Special Administrative District&quot; officially became a province of the Republic, the Hsikang Province. Kesang Tsering was sent by the Chinese to Batang to take control of Xikang, where he formed a local government. He was sent there for the purpose of propagating the Three Principles of the People to the Khampa.

In 1949, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army took control of Xikang. In 1955, western Xikang was merged into Sichuan, and eastern Xikang came under the administration of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

<text>Sheryl Denise Swoopes (born March 25, 1971) is an American former professional basketball player. She was the first player to be signed in the WNBA, is a three-time WNBA MVP, and was named one of the league&#x27;s Top 15 Players of All Time at the 2011 WNBA All-Star Game. Swoopes has won three Olympic gold medals and is one of eleven women&#x27;s basketball players to have won an Olympic gold medal, an NCAA Championship, a FIBA World Cup gold, and a WNBA title. She was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2017, she was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Brownfield, Texas, Swoopes was raised by her mother, Louise Swoopes, and played basketball with her three older brothers. She began competing at age seven in a local children&#x27;s league called Little Dribblers. She played basketball at Brownfield High School.

==College career==
Initially recruited by the University of Texas, Swoopes left the school shortly after her arrival without playing a game and enrolled at South Plains College. After playing at South Plains for two years, Swoopes transferred to Texas Tech, near her hometown.

In 1993, Swoopes won the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball championship with the Texas Tech Lady Raiders during her senior season. Her jersey was retired by the school the following year, making her one of only three Lady Raiders to be honored in this way. The others are Carolyn Thompson and Krista Kirkland, Swoopes&#x27; teammate from the 1993 championship team.

As of 2010, Swoopes was still a part of the women&#x27;s basketball record books in many categories, including single-game scoring record (53 points on March 13, 1993, vs. Texas, tied for tenth place), single-season scoring (955 points in the 1993 season, fourth place), highest championship tournament scoring average (35.4 in the 1993 tournament, second place), best single-game championship scoring performance (47 points vs. Ohio State, 1993 championship), which broke Bill Walton&#x27;s record, and scoring record for championship series (177 points, five games). She set the record for the most field goals in the championship game with 16.

Swoopes also set several school records at Texas Tech. She scored 955 in the 1992–93 season, which is an all-time scoring record for a single season (as of 2006). Swoopes&#x27; 24.9 points-per-game average for her career is the best in school history; she also boasts three triple-doubles and 23 double-doubles, 14 of which came during her senior year.

Swoopes was the 1993 winner of the Naismith College Player of the Year award at the age of 22, the Honda Sports Award, was selected as that year&#x27;s WBCA Player of the Year, and was chosen to the Division I All-American squad in both 1992 and 1993. Swoopes was named the 1993 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation.

==USA Basketball==
Swoopes was named to the USA national team and competed in the 1994 World Championships, held in June 1994 in Sydney, Australia. The team was coached by Tara VanDerveer, and won their first six games, when they faced Brazil. In a closely contested, high-scoring game, Brazil hit 10 of 10 free throws in the final minute to secure a 110–107 victory. The USA won a close final game against Australia 100–95 to earn the bronze medal. Swoopes averaged 9.1 points per game, while recording seven steals, second highest on the team.

Swoopes was selected to represent the US at the 1995 USA Women&#x27;s Pan American Games, but only four teams committed to participate, so the event was cancelled.

Swoopes continued as a member of the USA team at the 1996 Olympics, held in Atlanta, Georgia. The USA team won all their pool play games by large margins, although they were behind Cuba by as many as seven points before Lisa Leslie&#x27;s 24 points helped the USA take over the game. 

In 2002, Swoopes was named to the national team which competed in the World Championships in Zhangjiagang, Changzhou, and Nanjing, China. The team was coached by Van Chancellor. Swoopes scored 16.9 points per game, second highest on the team and recorded a team-high 24 steals. The USA team won all nine games, including a close title game against Russia, which had a one-point difference late in the game.

Swoopes was named to the National Team representing the US at the 2006 World Championships, held in Barueri and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The team won eight of their nine contests, but the lone loss came in the semifinal medal round to Russia. The USA beat Brazil in the final game to earn the bronze medal. Swoopes, hampered by injuries, averaged 3.0 points per game and was second on the team with six blocks.

==WNBA career==

Swoopes was recruited for the Houston Comets of the WNBA during the 1997 inaugural season. Due to the birth of her son, Swoopes had a late-season debut for her career, playing her first game on August 7, 1997 (6 weeks after the season started). In her debut game, the Comets defeated the Phoenix Mercury 74 - 70 with Swoopes playing for 5 minutes and recording no stats.

As a 11 year member of the Houston Comets, she accumulated over 2,000 career points, 500 career rebounds, 300 career assists, and 200 career steals. Her extraordinary scoring and defensive ability made her the first three-time WNBA MVP (2000, 2002, and 2005) and the first three-time WNBA Defensive Player of the Year (2000, 2002, and 2003). Swoopes is also a four-time WNBA champion as the Comets won the first 4 championships in WNBA history from 1997 to 2000.

Swoopes is the second player in WNBA history to win both the regular season MVP award and the All-Star Game MVP award in the same season. The first player to accomplish this was Lisa Leslie. Swoopes is also the first player in WNBA history to record a triple-double in both the regular season and the playoffs.

Swoopes gained national prominence when she won the gold medal with the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team at the 1996 Olympic Games and became a focal point of the fledgling WNBA. The 1996 Olympic win over Brazil (117–87) is considered by some to be the &quot;best woman&#x27;s basketball game they&#x27;d ever seen.&quot; She is a three-time Olympic gold medalist (1996, 2000, and 2004).

Swoopes is the first women&#x27;s basketball player to have a Nike shoe named after her: the &quot;Air Swoopes&quot;.

On March 3, 2008, Swoopes signed with the Seattle Storm, ending her 11-year career with the Houston Comets. She was waived by the Storm on February 3, 2009.

Two days after her 40th birthday in 2011, sources for the Associated Press claimed that Swoopes was preparing to return to the WNBA in anticipation of an official signing announcement from the Tulsa Shock. At the 2011 WNBA All-Star Game, she was announced as one of the top 15 players in the 15-year history of the WNBA.

On August 26, 2011, the 40-year-old Swoopes hit a buzzer-beating shot to edge the Los Angeles Sparks 77–75 and end the Shock&#x27;s WNBA-record 20-game losing streak.

Swoopes became an unrestricted free agent after the 2011 season: Tulsa Shock owner Steve Swetoha announced on 15 February 2012 that the team did not intend to offer Swoopes a new contract. As of the beginning of the 2012 preseason on 5 May, Swoopes remained an unsigned free agent. While no official announcement has been made, when Swoopes began blogging at the &quot;Shape&quot; magazine website during the 2012 Olympic Summer Games, she identified herself as &quot;a former professional basketball player.&quot;

Swoopes&#x27; final WNBA game was played on September 11, 2011, a 94–102 loss to the San Antonio Silver Stars, where she recorded 20 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists.

In 2016, she was voted into the WNBA Top 20@20, in celebration of the league&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

==Post-playing career==
In 2008, Sheryl Swoopes made an appearance on &quot;Shirts &amp; Skins&quot;, a reality series on Logo TV. Swoopes mentored the San Francisco Rockdogs, a gay basketball team, and shared her experiences on basketball, family, faith, and coming out.

In 2010, Swoopes was an assistant basketball coach at Mercer Island High School in Washington. She was a color analyst for the Texas Tech women&#x27;s basketball broadcast during the 2012–2013 season.

In 2013, Swoopes became head coach of the Loyola University Chicago women&#x27;s basketball team. In April 2016, Loyola announced that it was investigating Swoopes for alleged mistreatment, after the school newspaper reported that 10 of the team&#x27;s players had either transferred or wanted a release from their scholarships. On July 4, 2016, Loyola announced it had fired Swoopes as a result of the investigation but declined to say what it had found.

In July 2017, Swoopes returned to her alma mater, Texas Tech, hired as the women&#x27;s basketball program&#x27;s Director of Player Development, where her job included resuming work as broadcast color analysis for Lady Raiders games. Following the firing of head coach Candi Whitaker on January 1, 2018, Swoopes was promoted to regular assistant coach under interim head coach Shimmy Gray-Miller.

==Personal life==
Swoopes was married from June 1995 to 1999 to her high school sweetheart, with whom she has one son, Jordan Eric Jackson (b. 1997).

In October 2005, Swoopes announced she was gay, becoming one of the highest-profile athletes in a team sport to do so publicly. Swoopes said, &quot;it doesn&#x27;t change who I am. I can&#x27;t help who I fall in love with. No one can. ... Discovering I&#x27;m gay just sort of happened much later in life. Being intimate with [Alisa] or any other woman never entered my mind. At the same time, I&#x27;m a firm believer that when you fall in love with somebody, you can&#x27;t control that.&quot; She and her partner, former basketball player and Houston Comets assistant coach Alisa Scott, together raised Swoopes&#x27; son. The couple broke up in 2011. Later that year, Swoopes got engaged to Chris Unclesho, a longtime male friend; the couple wed after a long engagement on July 21, 2017.

==Awards and honors==
Swoopes won the female Associated Press Athlete of the Year award in 1993. The same year, she also won the Honda Sports Award for basketball and the WBCA Player of the Year award. She was named one of the 20 female athletes of the decade for 2000 to 2010 by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. She was named an LGBT History Month Icon by the Equality Forum.

<text>The is a railway line operated by the Japanese private railway operator Keio Corporation in the western suburbs of Tokyo, connecting in Tokyo with in Musashino City. It is not physically connected to the Keio Main Line Network, but a transfer is available at Meidaimae Station. This line is gauge, unlike other Keio lines which are gauge.

==Operation==
Keio operates two types of trains on the line: all-stations or () services and limited-stop services. During the daytime off-peak, one local and one express operate every 8 minutes on the line.

==Stations==
All stations are in Tokyo.

==History==
The line opened in 1933, dual track connecting Shibuya in Tokyo to , owned by , part of the Odakyu Group. The track gauge used was the same as for other Odakyu lines, and the overhead power supply was 600 V DC. The line was extended to in April 1934. In May 1940, the company merged with the Odakyu Electric Railway, and on 1 May 1942, Odakyu merged with to become a part of Tokyo Kyuko Electric Railway (present-day Tokyu Corporation), with the Teito Line renamed the Inokashira Line.

After World War II, Greater Tokyu was divided, and the Inokashira Line came under Keio ownership.

A line known as the connected Daita-nichōme Station (now Shindaita Station) on the Inokashira Line with Setagaya-Nakahara Station (now Setagaya-Daita Station) on the Odakyū Odawara Line from June 1945, but this was closed in 1952. The track and overhead wire was entirely removed in 1953, although some traces of the trackbed remain today.

Two stations, and , closed in July 1965 and were replaced by a new station, Komaba-Tōdaimae Station.

From 25 February 1969, following the voltage being increased to 1500 V DC, air-conditioned trains were introduced on the Inokashira Line. From 30 April 1971, the 3000 series trains were lengthened to 5-cars, and from 15 December 1971, limited-stop &quot;Express&quot; services started.

From 22 February 2013, station numbering was introduced on Keio lines. Inokashira Line stations were numbered prefixed with the letters &quot;IN&quot;.

==Rolling stock==
* Keio 1000 series 5-car EMUs (since 9 January 1996)

<doc id="1207048" wikidata="Q445748" url="?curid=1207048" title="Yolanda Griffith">
<text>Yolanda Evette Griffith (born March 1, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who played in both the ABL and WNBA. An eight time WNBA All-Star, she was named the 1999 WNBA MVP and the WNBA Finals MVP in 2005 when she won the WNBA championship with the Sacramento Monarchs. One of the top defensive players in WNBA&#x27;s history, she was the 1999 WNBA Defensive Player of the Year and led the league in rebounds and steals two times each. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the top 15 players in WNBA history. She is sometimes called by her nicknames: &quot;Yo&quot; and &quot;Yo-Yo&quot;. Griffith was inducted into the 2014 Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame&#x27;s class on her first year of eligibility. In 2021, she was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Griffith attended George Washington Carver High School in the Chicago area. In her senior year (1988–1989), she was named First-team &quot;Parade&quot; All-American, as well as first team All-America in softball.

==College career==
Griffith was offered a scholarship to play for the women&#x27;s basketball team at the University of Iowa, but had to cancel it after she gave birth to her daughter, Candace.

Afterward, she attended Palm Beach Junior College in Lake Worth, Florida, where she earned Junior College All-America honors in 1990-91. She later transferred to Florida Atlantic University, which was then a Division II school, where she graduated in 1993, earning Kodak Division II Player of the Year honors. While in school, she supported herself and her daughter by working for a car repossession company.

==Professional career==
===Germany===
Following her graduating from college, Griffith began her professional basketball playing career in Germany with DJK Wildcats Aschaffenburg, where she played from 1993 to 1997. In 1997, she finished as the top scorer and rebounder in the Euroleague Women, averaging 24.7 points and 17.1 rebounds per game.

=== American Basketball League ===
After four seasons in Germany, Griffith joined the American Basketball League (ABL). She was selected by the Long Beach Stingrays as the number one pick overall in the ABL players draft. In their only season, Griffith led the Stingrays to the brink of the ABL title, only to lose to the defending champions, the Columbus Quest. Griffith was named the 1997–1998 ABL Defensive Player of the Year and to the All-ABL first team. She finished second in the ABL&#x27;s 1998 Most Valuable Player voting to her future 2000 Summer Olympics teammate Natalie Williams.

When the Long Beach franchise folded after the end of the 1997–98 season, she was dealt to the expansion Chicago Condors, in her hometown. She played there only briefly, however, as the league folded on December 22, 1998. Prior to that, Griffith ranked fifth among league leaders in scoring (17.2 ppg), first in rebounding (12.3 rpg), 19th in assists (2.6 apg), second in steals (3.3 spg), and second in blocked shots (1.3 bpg).

===WNBA===
The Sacramento Monarchs selected Griffith as the no. 2 overall draft pick in the 1999 WNBA draft. She is a seven-time WNBA All-Star, and won the WNBA&#x27;s MVP, Newcomer of the Year and Defensive Player awards in 1999.

In 2001, Griffith set the WNBA single-season record for most offensive rebounds with 162.

In 2005, the Monarchs won their first WNBA title over the Connecticut Sun, three games to one in a best-of-five series. Griffith was named Finals MVP.

On April 8, 2008, after nine seasons with the Sacramento Monarchs, Griffith signed with the Seattle Storm.

On February 20, 2009, Griffith signed with the Indiana Fever, after a one-year stint with the Storm.

On June 9, 2009, Griffith tore her achilles tendon in a game against the Seattle Storm, her former team. In August the same year, she announced her retirement from professional basketball. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA. In 2016, Griffith was once again honoured by the WNBA in the WNBA Top 20@20 in celebration of the league&#x27;s 20th season.

===Europe===
As the WNBA and the seasons in Europe did not overlap, Griffith, like many other WNBA players played in Europe during the winter. She played two seasons for Lavezzini Basket Parma in Italy from 2000 to 2002. In 2003–2004 and 2005–2006, she played for Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg.

==Coaching career==
Griffith began her coaching career in 2009 as an assistant coach with the Indiana Fever. She was later an assistant coach at the college level with Dartmouth, Lafayette, Albany and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 2018, she became an assistant coach with the Boston College Eagles.

<text>Kim Il Sung University () is a public university in Taesong, Pyongyang, North Korea. It was founded on 1 October 1946 and was the first tertiary education institution established in post-war North Korea.

The 15-hectare campus, along with the main academic buildings, consists of 10 offices, 50 laboratories, libraries, museums, a printing press, an R&amp;D center, dormitories, and a hospital. There is a large computer lab, but it has limited internet access. The university is named in honour of former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.

The student body of Kim Il Sung University is approximately 16,000 students, and provides offers programs in law, economics, the humanities, and natural sciences. In the spring of 2017, specialised Japanese language and literature courses began being offered. Undergraduate degrees are typically four or five years. The university has a graduate school for doctoral students.

==History==

On 25 May 1946 the Preparatory Committee was formed by the founding universities. In July 1946, the university was established by order of the interim People&#x27;s Committee of North Korea (ordinance No. 40).

In 1948, four university faculties (Faculty of Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Medicine) were separated from Kim Il Sung University to form Pyongyang University of Technology (currently Kim Chaek University of Technology), Wonsan University of Agriculture, Pyongyang Medical College, and the Pyongyang University of Architecture.

During the Korean War, the university was located at Baeksong-ri under Mount Jamo in Suncheon-gun, which was far from the centre of the city. By late 1955, the reconstruction of the main building on the Pyongyang campus was in progress and soon the university moved back to the centre of Pyongyang.

After the war, Kim Il Sung University became known as a hotbed of intellectual dissent. Academics supported more intellectual freedoms than Kim loyalists, and disadvantageous factions within the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea were over-represented in university staff. Following the Revolutions of 1956 in Hungary and in Poland, North Korean exchange students were quickly repatriated from the affected countries. The students started asking &quot;improper&quot; questions on campus, causing alarm. After that, up to one hundred students and several prominent staff members were purged. The purging of the university gave further impetus to purges against functionalists all over the country.

By the end of 1970s more than 50,000 students had graduated from the university. In addition, the university was an important asset for the Korean People&#x27;s Army to train its personnel. 

Beginning in the 1970s, some English-medium programs have been taught at the university.

Until 2004, Pak Kwan-o, an authority on nuclear physics and current Chairman of the People&#x27;s Committee of Pyongyang (synonymous with mayor), had been serving as the president for 17 years. According to the university&#x27;s website, the current president is Kim Sung Chan who was appointed in 2021.

In May 2010, Pyongyang Medical College, Sariwon Kye Ung Sang Agricultural College and Pyongyang Agricultural College became members of the Kim Il Sung University Council. Those three institutions were later removed in October 2019.

According to Korean Central Television, North Korean students can take classes at and download lectures from Kim Il Sung University via the Mirae WiFi network, beginning in 2018.

==International students==
Kim Il Sung University first began admitting international students in 1995; as of 2019, approximately 5000 international students from 30 countries have studied at the university. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were estimated to be about 100 foreign students at Kim Il Sung University, the majority of whom were Chinese.

International students at Kim Il Sung University live alongside specially trained and vetted local students called &quot;tongsuksaeng&quot;, who are there to act as hosts and to teach the Korean language and culture. &quot;Tongsuksaeng&quot; are alleged to spy on international students.

Foreign students seeking to undertake postgraduate studies at Kim Il Sung University are required to provide their birth certificate, a letter of intent, their undergraduate qualification(s), a police background check from their home country, medical records, details of their financial background to show how they will be financing their education in North Korea, as well as a letter attesting to their Korean language ability.

<doc id="1207055" wikidata="Q408865" url="?curid=1207055" title="Resorcinol">
<text>Resorcinol (or resorcin) is a phenolic compound. It is an organic compound with the formula C6H4(OH)2. It is one of three isomeric benzenediols, the 1,3-isomer (or &quot;meta&quot;-isomer). Resorcinol crystallizes from benzene as colorless needles that are readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide.

==Production==
Resorcinol is produced in several steps from benzene, starting with dialkylation with propylene to give 1,3-diisopropylbenzene. Oxidation and Hock rearrangement of this disubstituted arene gives acetone and resorcinol.

Resorcinol is an expensive chemical, produced in only a very few locations around the world (as of 2010 only four commercial plants were known to be operative: in the United States, Germany, China, and Japan), and as such it is the determining factor in the cost of PRF adhesives. Production in the United States ended in 2017 with the closure of Indspec Chemical&#x27;s plant in Petrolia, Pennsylvania.

Many additional routes exist for resorcinol. It was formerly produced by disulfonation of benzene followed by hydrolysis of the 1,3-disulfonate. This method has been discarded because it cogenerates so much sulfur-containing waste. Resorcinol can also be produced when any of a large number of resins (such as galbanum and asafoetida) are melted with potassium hydroxide, or by the distillation of Brazilwood extract. It may be synthesized by melting 3-iodophenol, phenol-3-sulfonic acid with potassium carbonate. Diazotization of 3-aminophenol or on 1,3-diaminobenzene followed by hydrolysis provides yet another route. Many &quot;ortho&quot;- and &quot;para&quot;-compounds of the aromatic series (for example, the bromophenols, benzene-&quot;para&quot;-disulfonic acid) also yield resorcinol on fusion with potassium hydroxide.

==Reactions==
Partial hydrogenation of resorcinol gives dihydroresorcinol, also known as 1,3-cyclohexanedione.

It reduces Fehling&#x27;s solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, as does the isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcinol. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments.

Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160 °C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid.

When fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcinol. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, in the presence of dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, for example, with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145 °C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3COCH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200 °C it yields &quot;meta&quot;-dioxydiphenylamine. 

With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as a pH indicator under the name of lacmoid. It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin [(HO)C6H3(O)]2CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid. In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium acetoacetate to form 4-methylumbelliferone.

In presence of Sulfuric acid, with twice amount of Succinic acid, Resorcinol creates Fluorescence effect on water.

In addition to electrophilic aromatic addition, resorcinol (and other polyols) undergo nucleophilic substitution via the enone tautomer.

Nitration with concentrated nitric acid in the presence of cold concentrated sulfuric acid yields trinitroresorcin (styphnic acid), an explosive.

==Occurrence and use==
Derivatives of resorcinol are found in different natural sources. Alkylresorcinols are found in rye. Polyresorcinols are found as pseudotannins in plants.

===Adhesives===

Resorcinol is mainly used in the production of resins. As a mixture with phenol, it condenses with formaldehyde to afford adhesives. Such resins are used as adhesives in the rubber industry and others are used for wood glue. In relation to its conversion resins with formaldehyde, resorcinol is the starting material for resorcinarene rings.

===Medical uses===
It is present in over-the-counter topical acne treatments at 2% or less concentration, and in prescription treatments at higher concentrations. Monoacetylresorcinol, C6H4(OH)(O–COCH3), is used under the name of Euresol. It is used in hidradenitis suppurativa with limited evidence showing it can help with resolution of the lesions. Resorcinol is one of the active ingredients in products such as Resinol, Vagisil, and Clearasil.

In the 1950s and early 1960s the British Army used it, in the form of a paste applied directly to the skin. One such place where this treatment was given to soldiers with chronic acne was the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot, England. It was not always successful. 

4-Hexylresorcinol is an anesthetic found in throat lozenges.

===Chemical uses===
Resorcinol is used as a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. It is used in the production of diazo dyes and plasticizers and as a UV absorber in resins.

It is an analytical reagent for the qualitative determination of ketoses (Seliwanoff&#x27;s test).

It is the starting material for the initiating explosive lead styphnate.

Resazurin, C12H7NO4, obtained by the action of nitrous acid on resorcinol, forms small dark red crystals possessing a greenish metallic glance. When dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid and warmed to 210 °C, the solution on pouring into water yields a precipitate of resorufin, C12H7NO3, an oxyphenoxazone, which is insoluble in water but is readily soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, and in solutions of caustic alkalis. The alkaline solutions are of a rose-red color and show a cinnabar-red fluorescence. A tetrabromresorufin is used as a dyestuff under the name of Fluorescent Resorcin Blue.

Thioresorcinol is obtained by the action of zinc and hydrochloric acid on &quot;meta&quot;-benzenedisulfonyl chloride. It melts at 27 °C and boils at 243 °C. Resorcinol disulfonic acid, (HO)2C6H2(HSO3)2, is a deliquescent mass obtained by the action of sulfuric acid on resorcin. It is readily soluble in water and ethanol.

Resorcinol is also a common scaffold that is found in a class of anticancer agents, some of which (luminespib, ganetespib, KW-2478, and onalespib) were in clinical trials . Part of the resorcinol structure binds to inhibits the N-terminal domain of heat shock protein 90, which is a drug target for anticancer treatments.

==History, etymology, and nomenclature==
Austrian chemist Heinrich Hlasiwetz (1825–1875) is remembered for his chemical analysis of resorcinol and for his part in the first preparation of resorcinol, along with Ludwig Barth, which was published in 1864.

Benzene-1,3-diol is the name recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in its &quot;1993 Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry&quot;.

Resorcinol is so named because of its derivation from ammoniated resin gum, and for its relation to the chemical orcinol.

==Toxicity==
Resorcinol has low toxicity, with an (rats, oral) &gt; 300 mg/kg. It is less toxic than phenol.

Resorcinol was named a substance of very high concern under European Union REACH in 2022 because of its endocrine disrupting properties.

<text>The promptuary, also known as the &quot;card abacus&quot; is a calculating machine invented by the 16th-century Scottish mathematician John Napier and described in his book &quot;Rabdologiae&quot; in which he also described Napier&#x27;s bones.

It is an extension of Napier&#x27;s Bones, using two sets of rods to achieve multi-digit multiplication without the need to write down intermediate results, although some mental addition is still needed to calculate the result. The rods for the multiplicand are similar to Napier&#x27;s Bones, with repetitions of the values. The set of rods for the multiplier are shutters or masks for each digit placed over the multiplicand rods. The results are then tallied from the digits showing as with other lattice multiplication methods.
The final form described by Napier took advantage of symmetries to compact the rods, and used the materials of the day to hold system of metal plates, placed inside a wooden frame.

==Design of the Promptuary==

The promptuary consists of four parts:

* a set of number strips, engraved with a large digit at one end and with many small digits along the strip
* a set of mask strips, which Napier called excised or perforated strips. Each has a single digit engraved at one end and various triangular holes cut in it
* a board on which to place the strips when performing a calculation
* a box to store the strips. In Napier&#x27;s design, the top of the box was the board on which the calculations were performed.

The dimensions of the strips depends on the maximum number of digits in the numbers to be multiplied. For a device capable of multiplying two N-digit numbers together, the strips should be (N+1) times as long as they are wide, and there should be 10N number strips and 10N mask strips. So for example, for a promptuary capable of multiplying two five-digit numbers together, the strips should 6 times as long as they are wide, with 50 number strips and 50 mask strips. Napier&#x27;s example specified strips 1 finger (19mm) wide and 11 fingers (209mm) long, enabling the device to multiply two 10-digits numbers to produce a 20-digit result.

Napier specified that the number strips should be a different thickness from the mask strips - one quarter of a finger (5mm) versus one eight of a finger (2.5mm). This is not necessary for the operation of the device.

The promptuary contains a lot more pieces than a set of Napier&#x27;s Bones. A set of Napier&#x27;s Bones with 20 rods is capable of multiplying numbers of up to 8 digits. An equivalent promptuary needs 160 strips.

In the examples and illustrations below, N is set to 5 - that is, the illustrated promptuary can multiply numbers of up to 5 digits.

===Number Strips===

The number strips are divided into five squares, with about half a square free at each end. A large digit, known as the &quot;simple&quot;, is marked in the space at the top of the strip. A multiplication table is placed in each of the five squares. Each of these multiplication tables is identical—it lists the multiples of the simple and is laid out in a particular way:

The square is divided into nine smaller squares in a three-by-three arrangement. Each of these is divided into two triangles by a diagonal line running from lower left to upper right. The multiples of the digit at the top of the strip, the simple, are marked in the table as in the diagram.

* The simple itself is marked in the triangle labelled × 1.
* The number that is two times the simple is marked in the two triangles marked × 2. If the number is two digits, the first digit is placed to the left of the main diagonal (marked in red) and the second digit to the right of the diagonal. If the number is a single digit, it is marked to the right of the diagonal
* The number that is 3 times the simple is written in the triangles marked × 3 in the same way as the multiple of 2
* The other multiplies of the simple are marked in the other triangles in the same way.
* Zeroes may be written in or left blank. This does not affect the operation of the device.
* The triangle in the bottom left of the table is always blank.

The following diagram shows the multiplication table for the simple 7:

Complete number strips for the simple 7 and the simple 2 are shown in the following diagram. The lines delineating the triangles have been omitted.

===The Mask Strips===

Mask strips are placed horizontally across the calculating board, that is, from left to right rather than from top to bottom. They have a large digit written in the space at one end and the rest of the strip contains five squares. Each square has triangular holes cut in it according to the patterns given in the following diagram.

So for example the mask strips for the simples 3, 6 and 9 will look as follows:

The guide lines in the patterns are for positioning the holes. They do not need to appear on the strips. The main diagonal line of each mask pattern, however, shown here in red, is marked on the mask strip. It is an important part of the device. The pattern given here for the simple 0 is from later editions of Napier&#x27;s book. The version of the 0 strip in the first edition had no holes in it.

==Performing a Multiplication==

Number strips for the first of the numbers to be multiplied, the &quot;multiplicand&quot;, are placed on the calculating board side by side, running from top to bottom of the board. In the example shown here, the multiplicand is 772.

Mask strips for the second number, the &quot;multiplier&quot;, are placed horizontally on top of the number strips. In the example, the multiplier it 396.

The result of the multiplication is read from the device by examining the digits visible through the triangular holes in the mask strips. Those parts of the number strips that are not covered by the mask strips are ignored. The diagonal lines on the mask strips divide the device into diagonal bands containing digits visible through the holes.

* Starting at the right, the first band with any visible digits contains just one digit, a 2. This is written down as the right-most digit of the result.
* The next band from the right has three digits, 2, 1 and 8. These are added together to get 11. The units digit of this addition, 1, is written down as the next digit of the multiplication result. The tens digit, which is 1, is carried into the next band.
* The third band from the right has five digits, 2, 4, 3, 1 and 6 plus the carried 1. These are all added to produce 17. The units digit of this, 7, is written as the next digit of the result. The tens digit, 1, is carried into the next band.
* This process is repeated for each diagonal band from right to left until all the digits have been processed.

The full result has now been written down as 305712. This is the result of multiplying 772 by 396. The multiplication process required only addition, and no intermediate results needed to be written down.

==An Example of the Promptuary in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain==

An example of the Promptuary is in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. It also includes an example of Napier&#x27;s bones.

The apparatus is a box of wood with inlays of bone. In the top section it contains the &quot;bones&quot; calculation device, and in the bottom section is the promptuary. This example consists of 300 stored cards in 30 drawers. One hundred of these cards are covered with numbers (referred to as the &quot;number cards&quot;). The remaining two hundred cards contain small triangular holes, which, when laid on top of the number cards, allow the user to see only certain numbers. By the capable positioning of these cards, multiplications can be made up to the limit of a number 10 digits in length, by another number 20 digits in length.

In addition, the doors of the box contain the first powers of the digits, the coefficients of the terms of the first powers of the binomial and the numeric data of the regular polyhedra.

It is not known who was the maker of this piece, nor if it is of Spanish origin or came from a foreigner, although it is probable that it originally belonged to the Spanish Academy of Mathematics (which was created by Philip II) or was a gift from the Prince of Wales. The only thing that is sure is that it was conserved in the Palace, whence it was passed to the National library and later to the National Archaeological Museum, where it is still conserved.

In 1876, the Spanish government sent the apparatus to the exhibition of scientific instruments in Kensington, where it received so much attention that several societies consulted the Spanish representation about the origin and use of the apparatus.

<text>Elassoma is a genus of freshwater fish, the only member of subfamily Elassomatinae of the sunfish family Centrarchidae in the order Perciformes. It is sometimes classified as a separate family, the Elassomatidae, in a monotypic suborder, Elassomatoidei, in Perciformes. The type species is &quot;E. zonatum,&quot; the banded pygmy sunfish. The Elassomatinae are known collectively as pygmy sunfishes, but are considered by some authorities not to be true sunfishes, which are members of the family Centrarchidae. Some researchers believe they are related to sticklebacks and pipefishes (order Syngnathiformes) rather than Perciformes, though genetic research strongly implies a close relationship with the centrarchids. Currently the Integrated Taxonomic Information System classifies them in the family Elassomatidae rather than Centrarchidae.

The pygmy sunfishes grow to a maximum overall length of . They occur mostly in temperate and subtropical swamps, marshes, and other shallow, slow-moving, and heavily vegetated waters, across an area of the American South stretching from the Coastal Plain of North Carolina to central Florida, west along the Gulf Coast to eastern Texas, and north up the Mississippi River Valley to southern Illinois. The bluebarred, Carolina, and spring pygmy sunfishes have small localized populations and are considered Vulnerable.

The pygmy sunfishes are too small to be game fish, but are relatively popular as aquarium fish because of the males&#x27; iridescent colors and fascinating breeding behaviors. Eggs are laid on or beneath dense vegetation, and the male guards the nest area until the fry hatch and scatter. They adapt well to small aquaria and are relatively adaptable to a range of conditions, but seldom take conventional prepared fish foods, instead requiring small live worms, insects, or crustaceans as food.

== Etymology ==
The generic name &quot;Elassoma&quot; derives from the Greek ελάσσων (&quot;elasson&quot;) meaning smaller and σώμα (&quot;soma&quot;) meaning body, in reference to the fishes&#x27; diminutive size compared to the typical sunfishes.

==Species==
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
* &quot;Elassoma alabamae&quot; (spring pygmy sunfish)
* &quot;Elassoma boehlkei&quot; (Carolina pygmy sunfish)
* &quot;Elassoma evergladei&quot; (Everglades pygmy sunfish)
* &quot;Elassoma gilberti&quot; (Gulf Coast pygmy sunfish)
* &quot;Elassoma okatie&quot; (bluebarred pygmy sunfish)
* &quot;Elassoma okefenokee&quot; (Okefenokee pygmy sunfish)
* &quot;Elassoma zonatum&quot; (banded pygmy sunfish)

<text>Betty Bernice Lennox (born December 4, 1976) is an American retired professional basketball player. She played for the Minnesota Lynx, Miami Sol, Cleveland Rockers, Seattle Storm, Atlanta Dream, Los Angeles Sparks and Tulsa Shock in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). Her nicknames include &quot;Betty Basketball,&quot; &quot;Betty Big Buckets,&quot; and her most popular nickname &quot;B-Money.&quot;

==Childhood==
Born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Lennox grew up in the small town of Grant. Daughter of Bernice Jefferies and A. B. Lennox, and was raised by her mother primarily. She was the eighth of nine children and the youngest daughter in the family. She has five brothers, named Freddy, Karl, A. B., Alfred, and Charles. She also has three sisters named Lela, Ruby, and Victoria, all of them older than she is. She learned to play basketball with her four older brothers and one younger, who did not cut her any slack because she was a girl. She would learn to not be intimated by others while playing with her brothers as a child. She also developed her work ethic from growing up on a farm with her family. She was loading bales by age ten, each bale weighing 30 to 40 pounds, and did many daily chores while in primary school in Grant. Her full name is Betty Bernice Lennox, getting her middle name from her mother.

==High school career==
Betty spent three years attending Fort Osage High School in Independence, Missouri, under the coaching of Dale Williams. Betty played her sophomore year at Grant High School in Grant, OK. She originally learned the six-player game of basketball while in Oklahoma. She struggled when her family moved to Missouri, as she was not used to crossing over the center line to be a defensive player, as she had only been an offensive player while in Oklahoma.

==College years==
Lennox played college basketball at Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas for her sophomore year. Trinity Valley was her second community college, as she originally enrolled and played her Freshman year at Butler Community College in Kansas garnering all conference honors. She would transfer to Trinity Valley CC after her freshman year in 1996. Her Cardinals Trinity Valley CC team won the 1997 NJCAA Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship, an accomplishment she is most proud of. She was the MVP of the tournament, and finished the championship game with 27 points and 20 rebounds. Lennox then transferred to Louisiana Tech University, and graduated from there in 2000 with a BA in psychology. She took a year off from basketball while at LA Tech in 1998 to devote herself to her studies in order to complete her degree. She would play basketball for LA Tech for her final two years of college in 1999 &amp; 2000. She was named the 2000 Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year and a U.S. Basketball Writers Association First Team All-American while at Louisiana Tech University.

==WNBA career==
Lennox was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the sixth overall pick in the 2000 WNBA draft and later became the WNBA&#x27;s Rookie of the Year in 2000. She was also the first rookie to ever play in a WNBA All-Star Game that same year. She also made the All-WNBA 2nd Team in 2000 as well. She broke her hip in 2001, and was originally told that her basketball career would be over after the injury. With the work ethic she learned as a child, she fought back from her injury to come back and continued to thrive as a player.

On June 13, 2002, the Minnesota Lynx traded Lennox along with a 2003 first-round draft pick to the Miami Sol in exchange for Tamara Moore and a 2003 second-round draft pick. After the 2002 season ended, the Miami Sol folded and Lennox was selected by the Cleveland Rockers in the 2003 WNBA Dispersal draft. When the Rockers folded after the 2003 season ended, Lennox went through another Dispersal Draft before the 2004 season. This time, she was selected by the Seattle Storm.

Playing alongside Sue Bird and Lauren Jackson, Lennox helped lead the Seattle Storm to the 2004 WNBA Championship against the Connecticut Sun, winning 2–1 in the series. She was named the Finals Most Valuable Player, averaging 22.3 points per game during the series en route to winning the award. In 2005 with the Seattle Storm, Lennox made her 200th career three-pointer.

On February 6, 2008, Lennox was selected by the newly formed Atlanta Dream in the expansion draft. During the 2008 season with the Dream, Lennox averaged a career-high 17.5 points per game and scored a career-high 44 points against the Connecticut Sun. She was the Eastern Conference leading point scorer for the year. She reached the 3,000 point and 1,000 rebound milestones in the 2008 season as well.

Lennox was acquired by the Los Angeles Sparks for the 2009 season as an unrestricted free agent to join forces with Candace Parker, Lisa Leslie and Tina Thompson. Lennox helped lead the Sparks to the Western Conference finals where they were one win shy of advancing to the 2009 WNBA Finals, losing 2–1 to the Phoenix Mercury who ended up being the champions. During the 2010 season, a left knee injury would sideline Lennox while playing with the Sparks for the remainder of the season after playing only 11 games.

Lennox signed with the Tulsa Shock for the 2011 season, then waived before the start of the season, later re-signed for the remainder of the 2011 season, playing only 9 games. She would be sidelined for the later part of the season with a concussion. The 2011 season would be Lennox&#x27;s last season in the WNBA before retiring. Lennox played a total of 12 seasons in the WNBA.

==Overseas career==
Lennox has played overseas for a total of 7 off-season years during her 12-year career with the WNBA. She has been known to play internationally during the off season with the WNBA, playing for many teams throughout the world. She played in Turkey in 2010 for Tarsus Belediyes. She played for Nadezhda Orenburg in Russia in 2008 &amp; 2009 WNBA off-seasons. Earlier teams have included Coconuda Maddaloni in Italy for 2004–2005. She was in Poland with Lotos Gdynia in 2006–2007. She had been with K.V. Imperial EKA AEL Limassol in Greece during 2007–2008. While in Poland in 2007 her team was the regular season runner-up, and a finalist. In Cyprus during 2007–2008 her team was the regular season champion in 2007 and as well as championship winners, and Cyprus Cup Winner in 2008. She was also Eurobasket.com&#x27;s All-Russian superleague Honorable Mention in 2009. Additional teams and countries have included Israel for the 2000–2001 off-season for Elitzur Cellcom Holon. She also played for Beijing Great Wall in China during 2005–2006.

==Philanthropy==
Lennox started the Lennox Foundation 22 in 2005 to support children who were victims of neglect and abuse. The organization&#x27;s mission is to give these children better experiences and the chance to succeed with support, education, and love. They learn self-motivation through playing basketball. She was presented with the WNBA&#x27;s Community Assist Award in June 2006 for her charitable work.

==Life after basketball==
Since retiring from professional basketball, Lennox has been a basketball trainer for college students. She also travels nationwide to do motivational speaking and youth mentoring through her foundation. In March 2016, Lennox won the award for Woman of the Year at the 2016 Women of Distinction Awards.

==Personal life==
Lennox is also a Christian who comes from a deeply religious background and had a bible verse inscribed on the toes of her shoes that she wore during games (Philippians 4:13) which she says is the scripture that tells all about her life journey.

<text>Frederick Wallace Smith (born August 11, 1944) is an American business magnate and investor. He is the founder and chairman of FedEx Corporation, the world&#x27;s largest transportation company. Smith stepped down as CEO in June 2022 and was succeeded by Raj Subramaniam. He is considered one of the most successful transportation entrepreneurs in the world. He had an estimated net worth of $6.3 billion as of June 2024.

==Early life==
Frederick Smith was born in Marks, Mississippi, the son of James Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Smith, the founder of the Toddle House restaurant chain and the Smith Motor Coach Company (renamed the Dixie Greyhound Lines after The Greyhound Corporation bought a controlling interest in 1931). The elder Smith died when his son was only 4, and the boy was raised by his mother and uncles.

Smith was crippled by bone disease as a small boy but regained his health by age 10.

He attended elementary school at Presbyterian Day School in Memphis and high school at Memphis University School, and became an amateur pilot as a teen.

In 1962, Smith entered Yale University for pursuing economics. According to some sources, he wrote a paper for an economics class, outlining overnight delivery service, on which he received a “C”. In fact, in an interview, he said he doesn&#x27;t remember the grade. 

Additionally, Smith became a member and eventually the president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity and the Skull and Bones secret society. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in 1966. In his college years, he was a friend and DKE fraternity brother of future U.S. president George W. Bush. Smith was also friends with future U.S. Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry; the two shared an enthusiasm for aviation and were flying partners.

==Marine Corps service==
After graduation, Smith was commissioned in the U.S. Marine Corps, serving for three years (from 1966 to 1969) as a platoon leader and a forward air controller (FAC) in South Vietnam, flying in the back seat of the OV-10.

He served two tours of duty in the Vietnam War, and was honorably discharged in 1969 with the rank of captain, having received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts.

His Silver Star citation reads:

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant Frederick Wallace Smith, United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer of Company K, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 27 May 1968, while conducting a search and destroy operation, Company K became heavily engaged with a North Vietnamese Army battalion occupying well-entrenched emplacements on Goi Noi Island in Quang Nam Province. As Lieutenant Smith led his men in an aggressive assault upon the enemy positions, the North Vietnamese force launched a determined counterattack, supported by mortars, on the Marines&#x27; left flank. Unhesitatingly rushing through the intense hostile fire to the position of heaviest contact, Lieutenant Smith fearlessly removed several casualties from the hazardous area and, shouting words of encouragement to his men, directed their fire upon the advancing enemy soldiers, successfully repulsing the hostile attack. Moving boldly across the fire-swept terrain to an elevated area, he calmly disregarded repeated North Vietnamese attempts to direct upon him as he skillfully adjusted artillery fire and air strikes upon the hostile positions to within fifty meters of his own location and continued to direct the movement of his unit. Accurately assessing the confusion that supporting arms was causing among the enemy soldiers, he raced across the fire-swept terrain to the right flank of his company and led an enveloping attack on the hostile unit&#x27;s weakest point, routing the North Vietnamese unit and inflicting numerous casualties. His aggressive tactics and calm presence of min [sic] under fire inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in his unit accounting for the capture of two hostile soldiers as well as numerous documents and valuable items of equipment. By his courage, aggressive leadership and unfaltering devotion to duty at great personal risk, Lieutenant Smith upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.&quot;

==Business career==
In 1970, Smith purchased the controlling interest in an aircraft maintenance company, Ark Aviation Sales, and by 1971 turned its focus to trading used jets. On June 18, 1971, Smith founded Federal Express with his $4 million inheritance (approximately $29.8 million in 2023 dollars) and raised $91 million (approximately $690 million in 2023 dollars) in venture capital. In 1973, the company began offering service to 25 cities, shipping small packages and documents in a fleet of 14 Dassault Falcon 20 (DA-20) jets. His focus was on developing an integrated air-ground system. Smith developed FedEx on the business idea of a shipment version of a bank clearing house where one bank clearing house was located in the middle of the representative banks and all their representatives would be sent to the central location to exchange materials.

In the early days of FedEx, Smith had to go to great lengths to keep the company afloat. In one instance, after a crucial business loan was denied, he took the company&#x27;s last $5,000 to Las Vegas and won $27,000 gambling on blackjack to cover the company&#x27;s $24,000 fuel bill. It kept FedEx alive for one more week.

In 2003 Smith, along with Robert Rothman and Dwight Schar, purchased a minority share of the Washington Commanders, an American football franchise belonging to the National Football League. The three owned a total of 40% of the team until 2021, when they sold their stake to majority owner Dan Snyder following discontentment with Snyder. Smith also owns or co-owns several other entertainment companies, such as Alcon Entertainment.

In 2000, Smith made an appearance as himself in the Tom Hanks movie &quot;Cast Away&quot;, when Hanks&#x27;s character is welcomed back, which was filmed on location at FedEx&#x27;s home facilities in Memphis, Tennessee. As a DKE fraternity brother of George W. Bush while at Yale, there was some speculation after Bush&#x27;s 2000 election that Smith might be appointed to the Bush Cabinet as Defense Secretary. 
While Smith was Bush&#x27;s first choice for the position, he declined for medical reasons — Donald Rumsfeld was named instead. Although Smith was friends with both 2004 major candidates, John Kerry and George W. Bush, Smith chose to endorse Bush&#x27;s re-election in 2004. When Bush decided to replace Rumsfeld, Smith was offered the position again, but he declined in order to spend time with his terminally ill daughter.

Smith was a supporter of Senator John McCain&#x27;s 2008 Presidential bid, and was named national co-chairman of his campaign committee.

Smith was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame and also awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1998. He was inducted into the SMEI Sales &amp; Marketing Hall of Fame in 2000. His other awards include &quot;CEO of the Year 2004&quot; by Chief Executive Magazine and the 2008 Kellogg Award for Distinguished Leadership, presented by the Kellogg School of Management on May 29, 2008. He was also awarded the 2008 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is the 2011 recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for distinguished contributions to commercial aviation.
While CEO of FedEx in 2008, Smith earned a total compensation of $10,434,589, which included a base salary of $1,430,466, a cash bonus of $2,705,000, stocks granted of $0, and options granted of $5,461,575.
In June 2009, Smith expressed interest in purchasing the controlling share (60%) of the St. Louis Rams from Chip Rosenbloom and Lucia Rodriguez. In 2009, Smith earned a total compensation of $7,740,658, which included a base salary of $1,355,028, a cash bonus of $0, stocks granted of $0, options granted of $5,079,191, and other compensation totaling $1,306,439.

In March 2014, Fortune Magazine ranked him 26th among the list of the &quot;World&#x27;s 50 Greatest Leaders&quot;.

In March 2022, Smith announced that he would step down as CEO and become executive chairman. He named long-time FedEx executive Raj Subramaniam as his successor.

== Forgery indictment and car crash ==
On January 31, 1975, Fred Smith was indicted for forgery by a federal grand jury. The suit was filed by Smith&#x27;s two half-sisters. The lawsuit alleged Smith had forged documents to obtain a $2 million bank loan and he and executives of his family&#x27;s trust fund had sold stock from the fund for a loss of $14 million. A warrant for Smith&#x27;s arrest was issued for which Smith posted bond with federal authorities in Memphis. Smith was later found not guilty on the forgery charge.

The same evening of his forgery indictment Smith was involved in a fatal hit and run in which he killed a 54-year-old handyman named George C. Sturghill. Smith was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a crash and driving with an expired license. He was released on a $250 bond. All charges were later dismissed.

This was not the first time Smith was involved in a fatal car crash. During his first summer break from Yale, Smith was back in Memphis driving out to a lake with friends when he lost control of the car he was driving, causing the vehicle to flip and killing the passenger in the front seat. The cause of the crash was never determined.

== Personal life ==
Smith has ten children, including photographer Windland Smith Rice, film producer Molly Smith and former Atlanta Falcons head coach and current Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. His eldest son, Richard W. Smith, is a high level executive at FedEx.

<text>In abstract algebra, the biquaternions are the numbers , where , and are complex numbers, or variants thereof, and the elements of multiply as in the quaternion group and commute with their coefficients. There are three types of biquaternions corresponding to complex numbers and the variations thereof:
* Biquaternions when the coefficients are complex numbers.
* Split-biquaternions when the coefficients are split-complex numbers.
* Dual quaternions when the coefficients are dual numbers.

This article is about the &quot;ordinary biquaternions&quot; named by William Rowan Hamilton in 1844. Some of the more prominent proponents of these biquaternions include Alexander Macfarlane, Arthur W. Conway, Ludwik Silberstein, and Cornelius Lanczos. As developed below, the unit quasi-sphere of the biquaternions provides a representation of the Lorentz group, which is the foundation of special relativity.

The algebra of biquaternions can be considered as a tensor product , where is the field of complex numbers and is the division algebra of (real) quaternions. In other words, the biquaternions are just the complexification of the quaternions. Viewed as a complex algebra, the biquaternions are isomorphic to the algebra of complex matrices . They are also isomorphic to several Clifford algebras including , the Pauli algebra , and the even part of the spacetime algebra.

== Definition ==
Let be the basis for the (real) quaternions , and let be complex numbers, then
: formula_1
is a &quot;biquaternion&quot;. To distinguish square roots of minus one in the biquaternions, Hamilton and Arthur W. Conway used the convention of representing the square root of minus one in the scalar field by to avoid confusion with the in the quaternion group. Commutativity of the scalar field with the quaternion group is assumed:
: formula_2

Hamilton introduced the terms &quot;bivector&quot;, &quot;biconjugate&quot;, &quot;bitensor&quot;, and &quot;biversor&quot; to extend notions used with real quaternions .

Hamilton&#x27;s primary exposition on biquaternions came in 1853 in his &quot;Lectures on Quaternions&quot;. The editions of &quot;Elements of Quaternions&quot;, in 1866 by William Edwin Hamilton (son of Rowan), and in 1899, 1901 by Charles Jasper Joly, reduced the biquaternion coverage in favour of the real quaternions.

Considered with the operations of component-wise addition, and multiplication according to the quaternion group, this collection forms a 4-dimensional algebra over the complex numbers . The algebra of biquaternions is associative, but not commutative. A biquaternion is either a unit or a zero divisor. The algebra of biquaternions forms a composition algebra and can be constructed from bicomplex numbers. See &quot;&quot; below.

== Place in ring theory ==

=== Linear representation ===
Note that the matrix product
: formula_3.

Because is the imaginary unit, each of these three arrays has a square equal to the negative of the identity matrix.
When this matrix product is interpreted as , then one obtains a subgroup of matrices that is isomorphic to the quaternion group. Consequently,
: formula_4
represents biquaternion .
Given any complex matrix, there are complex values , , , and to put it in this form so that the matrix ring is isomorphic to the biquaternion ring.

=== Subalgebras ===
Considering the biquaternion algebra over the scalar field of real numbers , the set
: formula_5
forms a basis so the algebra has eight real dimensions. The squares of the elements , and are all positive one, for example, .

The subalgebra given by
: formula_6
is ring isomorphic to the plane of split-complex numbers, which has an algebraic structure built upon the unit hyperbola. The elements and also determine such subalgebras.

Furthermore,
: formula_7
is a subalgebra isomorphic to the bicomplex numbers.

A third subalgebra called coquaternions is generated by and . It is seen that , and that the square of this element is . These elements generate the dihedral group of the square. The linear subspace with basis thus is closed under multiplication, and forms the coquaternion algebra.

In the context of quantum mechanics and spinor algebra, the biquaternions , and (or their negatives), viewed in the representation, are called Pauli matrices.

== Algebraic properties ==
The biquaternions have two &quot;conjugations&quot;:
* the biconjugate or biscalar minus bivector is formula_8 and
* the complex conjugation of biquaternion coefficients formula_9
where formula_10 when formula_11

Note that formula_12

Clearly, if formula_13 then is a zero divisor. Otherwise formula_14 is a complex number. Further, formula_15 is easily verified. This allows the inverse to be defined by
* formula_16, if formula_17

=== Relation to Lorentz transformations ===
Consider now the linear subspace
: formula_18

 is not a subalgebra since it is not closed under products; for example formula_19 Indeed, cannot form an algebra if it is not even a magma.

Proposition: If is in , then formula_20

Proof: From the definitions,
: formula_21

Definition: Let biquaternion satisfy formula_22 Then the Lorentz transformation associated with is given by
: formula_23

Proposition: If is in , then is also in .

Proof: formula_24

Proposition: formula_25

Proof: Note first that &quot;gg&quot;* = 1 implies that the sum of the squares of its four complex components is one. Then the sum of the squares of the &quot;complex conjugates&quot; of these components is also one. Therefore, formula_26 Now
: formula_27

== Associated terminology ==
As the biquaternions have been a fixture of linear algebra since the beginnings of mathematical physics, there is an array of concepts that are illustrated or represented by biquaternion algebra. The transformation group formula_28 has two parts, formula_29 and formula_30 The first part is characterized by formula_31 ; then the Lorentz transformation corresponding to is given by formula_32 since formula_33 Such a transformation is a rotation by quaternion multiplication, and the collection of them is formula_34 But this subgroup of is not a normal subgroup, so no quotient group can be formed.

To view formula_35 it is necessary to show some subalgebra structure in the biquaternions. Let represent an element of the sphere of square roots of minus one in the real quaternion subalgebra . Then and the plane of biquaternions given by formula_36 is a commutative subalgebra isomorphic to the plane of split-complex numbers. Just as the ordinary complex plane has a unit circle, formula_37 has a unit hyperbola given by
: formula_38

Just as the unit circle turns by multiplication through one of its elements, so the hyperbola turns because formula_39 Hence these algebraic operators on the hyperbola are called hyperbolic versors. The unit circle in and unit hyperbola in are examples of one-parameter groups. For every square root of minus one in , there is a one-parameter group in the biquaternions given by formula_40

The space of biquaternions has a natural topology through the Euclidean metric on -space. With respect to this topology, is a topological group. Moreover, it has analytic structure making it a six-parameter Lie group. Consider the subspace of bivectors formula_41. Then the exponential map
formula_42 takes the real vectors to formula_29 and the -vectors to formula_30 When equipped with the commutator, forms the Lie algebra of . Thus this study of a six-dimensional space serves to introduce the general concepts of Lie theory. When viewed in the matrix representation, is called the special linear group in .

Many of the concepts of special relativity are illustrated through the biquaternion structures laid out. The subspace corresponds to Minkowski space, with the four coordinates giving the time and space locations of events in a resting frame of reference. Any hyperbolic versor corresponds to a velocity in direction of speed where is the velocity of light. The inertial frame of reference of this velocity can be made the resting frame by applying the Lorentz boost given by since then formula_45 so that formula_46
Naturally the hyperboloid formula_47 which represents the range of velocities for sub-luminal motion, is of physical interest. There has been considerable work associating this &quot;velocity space&quot; with the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry. In special relativity, the hyperbolic angle parameter of a hyperbolic versor is called rapidity. Thus we see the biquaternion group provides a group representation for the Lorentz group.

After the introduction of spinor theory, particularly in the hands of Wolfgang Pauli and Élie Cartan, the biquaternion representation of the Lorentz group was superseded. The new methods were founded on basis vectors in the set
: formula_48

which is called the &quot;complex light cone&quot;. The above representation of the Lorentz group coincides with what physicists refer to as four-vectors. Beyond four-vectors, the standard model of particle physics also includes other Lorentz representations, known as scalars, and the -representation associated with e.g. the electromagnetic field tensor. Furthermore, particle physics makes use of the representations (or projective representations of the Lorentz group) known as left- and right-handed Weyl spinors, Majorana spinors, and Dirac spinors. It is known that each of these seven representations can be constructed as invariant subspaces within the biquaternions.

== As a composition algebra ==
Although W. R. Hamilton introduced biquaternions in the 19th century, its delineation of its mathematical structure as a special type of algebra over a field was accomplished in the 20th century: the biquaternions may be generated out of the bicomplex numbers in the same way that Adrian Albert generated the real quaternions out of complex numbers in the so-called Cayley–Dickson construction. In this construction, a bicomplex number has conjugate .

The biquaternion is then a pair of bicomplex numbers , where the product with a second biquaternion is
: formula_49

If formula_50 then the &quot;biconjugate&quot; formula_51

When is written as a 4-vector of ordinary complex numbers,
: formula_52
The biquaternions form an example of a quaternion algebra, and it has norm
: formula_53
Two biquaternions and satisfy , indicating that is a quadratic form admitting composition, so that the biquaternions form a composition algebra.

<doc id="1207072" wikidata="Q2692509" url="?curid=1207072" title="Beadle">
<text>A beadle, sometimes spelled bedel, is an official who may usher, keep order, make reports, and assist in religious functions; or a minor official who carries out various civil, educational or ceremonial duties on the manor.

The term has pre-Conquest origins in Old English, deriving from the Old English &quot;bydel&quot; (&quot;herald, messenger from an authority, preacher&quot;), itself deriving from &quot;beodan&quot; (&quot;to proclaim&quot;, which has a modern descendant in the English verb &quot;bid&quot;). In Old English it was a title given to an Anglo-Saxon officer who summoned householders to council. It is also known in Medieval Latin as &quot;bedellus&quot;.

The Domesday Book refers to Beadles as &quot;bedelli&quot; or undersheriffs of manors.

== In religion ==
In England, the word came to refer to a parish constable of the Anglican Church, one often charged with duties of charity. A famous fictional constabulary beadle is Mr. Bumble from Charles Dickens&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, who oversees the parish workhouse and orphanage of a country town more than from London. The work of a real constabulary beadle of Whitechapel in that period may be exemplified by Richard Plunkett.

In the Church of Scotland, the title is used for one who attends the minister during divine service as an assistant.

In Judaism, the term &quot;beadle&quot; or &quot;sexton&quot; (in ) is sometimes used for the &quot;gabbai&quot;, the caretaker or &quot;man of all work&quot;, in a synagogue. Moishe the Beadle, the caretaker of a synagogue in Sighet in the 1940s, is an important character in &quot;Night&quot; by Elie Wiesel.

== In education ==
In the medieval universities, beadles were students chosen by instructors to act as assistants: carrying books, taking attendance, and assisting in classroom management.
In some universities in England the post of &quot;bedel&quot; or &quot;esquire bedell&quot; still exists as a ceremonial role. At the University of Oxford there are six bedels whose role is defined as being to &quot;attend upon the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, the Proctors and other participating dignitaries on such occasions, and assist them and other University members to carry out ceremonial duties&quot; and to &quot;deputise for the University Verger as necessary&quot;. At the University of Cambridge there are two esquire bedells who &quot;have certain important responsibilities at congregations&quot;, including carrying the university&#x27;s ceremonial maces, the senior esquire bedell also having &quot;general responsibility for the correct formulation and wearing of academical dress&quot;. At Durham University there are two bedels; their roles are to lead the graduand and academic processions carrying the university mace and Durham Cathedral&#x27;s verge, and to direct students and honorary graduates at graduation and matriculation ceremonies. The University of London has an esquire bedell who carries the mace and a number of bedells who carry wands (poles with the university&#x27;s coat of arms at the top), who also have the responsibility for controlling the line of graduates. Bedels are also used at Newcastle University and the University of Bath, where they bear the university mace at graduation ceremonies, and at Keele University, where they bear a ceremonial baton and are accompanied by a mace bearer.
Some universities in Scotland, including the University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow and the University of Dundee, have a ceremonial &quot;bedellus&quot;, who may also be the head janitor and be responsible for the maintenance of the university buildings. The bedellus traditionally carries or leads the mace in procession and may also be responsible for hooding graduates.

Some Commonwealth and US universities also have beadles in ceremonial roles, under a variety of different spellings. These include the bedel at Emory University, who is traditionally the president of the Student Government Association, the esquire or madam bedel at the University of Canterbury, the bedel at McMaster University, the esquire bedel at the Australian National University, the esquire bedell at the University of New England, and the beadle at the University of Queensland.

At some Dutch universities, including the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, and Utrecht University the Office of the Beadle manages doctoral and other ceremonies.

Jesuit secondary schools formerly maintained the post of beadle—some still do. In each classroom, a student designated as beadle reports attendance to the teacher, acts as messenger, assists in distributing materials, and leads the class in activities.

The position of Beadle also exists at the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, where the beadle&#x27;s task is making sure that pupils are dressed correctly and arrive at lessons on time.

==Civic and other uses==
Outside of religious and educational institutions, the designation of &quot;beadle&quot; is most often held by officers of secular bodies of some antiquity.

=== City of London ===
In the City of London the title is held by two distinct groups; both originated as &quot;executors&quot; or police for more senior persons.

====Ward beadles====

The first group are the ward beadles, who hold the oldest elected office in the City (as functionaries, not as representatives) in their wards. Their duties today are largely ceremonial in that they accompany the aldermen in the eight major ceremonies of the civic calendar and open and close the wardmotes (the election meetings for members of the City&#x27;s courts of Aldermen and Common Council). Previously (as described in the 15th-century &quot;Liber Albus&quot;) they were also responsible for preparing the register of the Freemen of their Wards, summoning them to the wardmotes and folk-motes [i.e. Common Hall], and administering fines for non-attendance. Elections in the City today are organised by specialist professionals and fines are no longer levied in this way.

====Livery companies====

The second group are paid employees of the livery companies of the City. These beadles are usually assistants to the company&#x27;s clerk, being responsible for attendance on the court and master of the company, originally to enforce its trade policy and uphold discipline (especially among the company&#x27;s apprentices) but now to act as masters-of-ceremony at formal banquets and to accompany the master on civic occasions. The title &quot;hall beadle&quot; is sometimes used by the hall manager of a livery hall responsible for the company&#x27;s treasure and the efficient running of the hall, especially if let on a commercial basis.

=== Elsewhere ===

The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire employs a Beadle to perform ceremonial duties.

Sometimes the title is used by uniformed security guards. For example, security duties at the Burlington Arcade, an upmarket shopping mall in Piccadilly, London, are carried out by staff called &quot;beadles&quot; wearing what appear to be nineteenth century uniforms. The beadles enforce the bylaws of the Arcade, which (among other things) forbid singing, running and carrying large parcels or open umbrellas. At one time the beadles were all old soldiers of the 10th Hussars (the regiment of Lord Chesham, the sometime owner of the Arcade).

<text>The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens is a zoo founded in 1966 and located in Los Angeles, California, United States. The city of Los Angeles owns the zoo, its land and facilities, and the animals.

==History ==

Eastlake Zoo, opened in Eastlake Park (renamed Lincoln Park in 1917) in 1885. The second zoo, Griffith Park Zoo, opened in 1912 and was located about south of the current zoo site until it was closed in August 1966. Remnants of the original zoo remain. The zoo opened in its present location on November 28, 1966. The site was formerly the location of Rodger Young Village, which was itself built on the land which had been used for the Griffith Park Aerodrome.

By the early 1990s, the zoo&#x27;s infrastructure was deteriorating. In January 1992, a ten-inch water pipe burst, leaving half of the zoo without water. The next day, city officials passed a $300 million master plan that had been recently drafted to deal with the infrastructure problems and inadequate exhibits. The zoo nearly lost its accreditation in 1995 because of numerous health and safety violation; it rebounded under a new director. The number of species exhibited has been reduced from 400 in 1993 to around 280, coinciding with construction of larger naturalistic enclosures holding animals in bigger groups.

In 1998, the zoo opened Chimpanzees of the Mahale Mountains, followed by Red Ape RainForest in 2000, the Komodo Dragon Exhibit, the Winnick Family Children Zoo in 2001, the Entry Plaza, Children&#x27;s Discovery Center and Sea Lion Cliffs (now Sea Life Cliffs) in 2005, Campo Gorilla Reserve in November 2007, Elephants of Asia in the winter of 2010, and the LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles) in 2012.

===Notable incidents===
A spate of escapes took place during the late 1990s and early 2000s when, in half a decade, at least 35 animals escaped the zoo including zebras, chimpanzees, kangaroos and antelopes.

Evelyn, the gorilla, escaped her enclosure approximately five times. In one widely covered incident, she used some overgrown vines to pull herself out of her exhibit. She then had full run of the zoo for an hour as TV-news copters hovered overhead and visitors were evacuated before she was tranquilized. In a prior incident, she hopped on the back of another gorilla, Jim, to make her escape (Jim had also previously escaped). Part of the problem was that the gorilla habitat was originally intended to house bears; this was alleviated by the opening of a specially designed Campo Gorilla Reserve in 2007.

In 1979, Virginia, a wolf, escaped the zoo multiple times by ascending trees, climbing fences, and walking along branches until she could escape. At one time she eluded capture for a month by hiding in Griffith Park. It is unclear whether Virginia was ever recaptured.

On June 26, 2012, a chimpanzee infant baby, born to Gracie, a member of a 15-chimpanzee tribe (one of the largest chimpanzee tribes of any North American zoo), was mauled to death by an adult male chimpanzee. The zoo said this event was totally unexpected, although it also stated that acts of aggression by male chimpanzees (toward humans, or toward a rival male chimpanzee over territory or a desired female) are always a possibility. Gracie was allowed to keep her baby overnight to grieve, and counseling was being offered to staff (none had witnessed the event), and to the visitors who had seen the event. It is reexamining its policy of how it introduces baby chimpanzees to the tribe.

In 2014, a bighorn sheep escaped from its enclosure, and ultimately the zoo itself. It was struck by a car approximately three hours later and subsequently died.

In 2016, Killarney the koala was killed by P-22, the cougar that lived in Griffith Park.

==Exhibits and attractions==

===Botanical Gardens===
In 2002, the zoo became a certified botanical garden, and the official name of the institution was changed to the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens. Throughout the zoo grounds, there are 15 different collections of plants, highlighting over 800 different species, with a total of over 7,400 individual plants.

===Chimpanzees of Mahale Mountains===
Chimpanzees of Mahale Mountains, a one-acre (0.4-ha) exhibit complex, opened in 1998 and houses chimpanzees. The hillside exhibit is dotted with boulders, palm trees, and an artificial termite mound, and features a waterfall next to a tall rock ledge where the troop&#x27;s leader can survey much of the area. Guests can view the animals across various moats or through a glass viewing window.

===Campo Gorilla Reserve===
Campo Gorilla Reserve opened in November 2007 featuring western lowland gorillas in a complex. Guests view the animals through two glass observation windows and three other locations. On January 18, 2020, an endangered western lowland gorilla was born at the Los Angeles Zoo, the first to be born there in over two decades. Plants in the exhibit include palms, pomegranates, and ferns.

===Elephants of Asia===
Not to be confused with Singapore Zoo’s Elephants of Asia, this $42 million exhibit complex at the center of the zoo opened in 2010 and houses Asian elephants and other southeast Asian wildlife. The main elephant enclosure is and has a barn used for medical exams. The complex is divided into several areas, each based on a different country in the elephants&#x27; range. The Thai Pavilion teaches visitors about the role of elephant labor in Thailand&#x27;s economy. Guests can find information about elephant conservation in India at Elephants of India Plaza, which also has a waterfall where the animals can bathe. The Elephants of China section houses sarus crane and Chinese water deer in a marsh habitat and has information about the history of the Dai people and their relationship with elephants.

===The LAIR===
The LAIR (&quot;Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles&quot;), which opened in 2012, is a $14 million indoor-outdoor exhibit complex that focuses on herps and terrestrial arthropods. Guests first pass through the &quot;Oak Woodland Pond&quot;, where local species can move in and live among native plants. The next feature is the main building where the &quot;Damp Forest&quot; houses poison dart frogs, Chinese giant salamanders, and a recreation of a Daintree Rainforest river with archerfish, Australian lungfish, and Fly River turtles. The Mangshan pitviper, west African green mamba, South American bushmaster and other snakes live in the next segment of the building, &quot;Betty&#x27;s Bite and Squeeze Room&quot;, named after Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association co-chair Betty White. Guests can see keepers care for animals behind the scenes in the &quot;Behind the Glass&quot; room. The &quot;Care and Conservation Room&quot; showcases Gray&#x27;s monitor and other endangered reptiles. After the main building is &quot;Arroyo Lagarto&quot;, a set of outdoor exhibits for Madagascar radiated tortoise, Madagascar spider tortoise, desert lizards, and California desert tortoise. A secondary building, the &quot;Desert LAIR&quot;, houses the Gila monster, Sonoran toad, Arizona Desert hairy scorpion, California kingsnake, and other species from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California. The LAIR ends with &quot;Crocodile Swamp&quot;, an outdoor exhibit home to false gharials.

===Red Ape Rain Forest===

Red Ape Rain Forest, a recreation of a Southeast Asian jungle, opened in 2000 and houses Bornean orangutans. The mesh enclosure, which has openings for the guest path to go through, is shaped like a horizontal donut and back-dropped by hibiscus, bamboo, and rubber trees. The apes can climb on artificial sway poles, branches, and vines placed throughout the exhibit or wade in a shallow stream. Visitors enter the exhibit through an Indonesian pagoda, continue over the stream on a deck bridge, and arrive at a small pavilion with a glass viewing window. The path next leads to a large central deck where guests can view the entirety of the surrounding exhibit. Afterwards, guests proceed to an interpretive area with traditional Indonesian folklore and exit the exhibit area through another pagoda.

===Rainforest of the Americas===
Rainforest of the Americas features animals who live in the tropical regions of North, Central, and South America. It opened in 2014 and houses the uakari, southern black howler monkey, red-bellied piranha, keel-billed toucan, harpy eagle, Goliath bird-eating spider, giant river otter, emerald tree boa, cotton-top tamarin, Baird&#x27;s tapir, jaguar and other species.

The Los Angeles Zoo has been successful in its breeding program of the rare California condor, helping to grow the number of condors in the world from a low of 22 in the 1980s to over 430 today. It is one of the few zoos worldwide to have the mountain tapir, and is the only zoo outside of Peru and Brazil to house the red uakari. It was one of the first zoos to successfully breed echidnas and gave birth to the first Coquerel&#x27;s sifaka outside of Madagascar, the sifaka&#x27;s native homeland.

==Management ==
The city of Los Angeles owns the zoo, its land and facilities, and the animals. Animal care, grounds maintenance, construction, education, public information, and administrative staff are city employees. As of June 2019, Denise M. Verret serves as the zoo&#x27;s director, the first female African American director of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited institution. The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association (GLAZA) was created in 1963 and is a nonprofit corporation created to support the Los Angeles Zoo in its mission to nurture wildlife and enrich the human experience. GLAZA&#x27;s primary responsibility is to seek and provide financial support for the zoo&#x27;s programs and capital projects. GLAZA also provides support through membership, organizing special events and travel programs, producing publications, coordinating one of the largest zoo volunteer programs in the country, administering the contract for visitor services concessions within the zoo, and supporting community relations, and public relations.

==Gottlieb Animal Health and Conservation Center==
Named after philanthropists Robert and Suzanne Gottlieb, the Gottlieb Animal Health and Conservation Center is a facility situated in a restricted area in the upper reaches of the zoo. Among other features, it includes a state-of-the-art intensive care unit, an on-site commissary, a surgical suite with observation area, and research facilities. In 2007 the facility handled 853 medical cases. The smallest patient treated was a spider tortoise (0.08 kg) and the largest was an Asian elephant (4,826 kg).

==Shows and activities==

California Condor Rescue Zone (CCRZ): The CCRZ is a play space designed for children ages 6 and up, where they can learn how California condors are protected. The area also features live webcam feeds of the California Condors, which are not currently exhibited because of the sensitive nature of the rescue work.

World of Birds Show: Birds of prey and other endangered birds perform. Show times: 11:30am and 3:30pm, daily, except Tuesdays. The World of Birds Show is currently running but the birds are still in training.

Animals &amp; You Program: These 15-minute-long animal presentations take place at stations in the Winnick Family Children&#x27;s Zoo.

Winnick Family Children&#x27;s Zoo: Located at the top of Winnick Family Children&#x27;s Zoo, this petting zoo enables visitors to pet goats and sheep in an animal contact area known as Muriel&#x27;s Ranch. Brushes are available at Muriel&#x27;s Ranch for visitors to groom the domestic animals.

Neil Papiano Play Park: The Neil Papiano Play Park (located in the upper zoo along the perimeter road) incorporates animal-themed climbing sculptures, large play structures, a toddler area, water misters, grassy landscaping, and a large picnic area. It was designed to be accessible to all children visiting the zoo, including those with medical and physical challenges.

==Magnet Center==
The North Hollywood High School Zoo Magnet Center is located across the street from the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens in Griffith Park. The program was established in 1981 in the hopes of &quot;a vision of providing a racially, ethnically, economically, and geographically diverse group of motivated students an enriched curriculum in animal and biological sciences.&quot; The Zoo Magnet Center offers 300 Los Angeles high school students a college preparatory curriculum focused on animal studies and biological sciences. It is also run by the Los Angeles Unified School District.

The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Garden&#x27;s partnership with the Zoo Magnet Center provides high school students with opportunities to study and to practice wildlife conservation, animal care, biology, chemistry, and environmental stewardship in a hands-on environment.

<doc id="1207078" wikidata="Q3404825" url="?curid=1207078" title="Black Elk Speaks">
<text>Black Elk Speaks is a 1932 book by John G. Neihardt, an American poet and writer, who relates the story of Black Elk, an Oglala Lakota medicine man. Black Elk spoke in Lakota and Black Elk&#x27;s son, Ben Black Elk, who was present during the talks, translated his father&#x27;s words into English. Neihardt made notes during these talks which he later used as the basis for his book.

The prominent psychologist Carl Jung read the book in the 1930s and urged its translation into German; in 1955, it was published as Ich rufe mein Volk (I Call My People).

Reprinted in the US in 1961, with a 1988 edition named Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux, as told through John G. Neihardt (Flaming Rainbow) and a State University of New York Press 2008 Premier Edition annotated by Lakota scholar Raymond DeMallie, the book has found an international audience. However, the book has come under fire for what critics describe as inaccurate representations of Lakota culture and beliefs.

== Background ==
In the summer of 1930, as part of his research into the Native American perspective on the Ghost Dance movement, the poet and writer John G. Neihardt, already the Nebraska poet laureate, received the necessary permission from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to go to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Accompanied by his two daughters, he went to meet an Oglala holy man named Black Elk. His intention was to talk to someone who had participated in the Ghost Dance. For the most part, the reservations were not then open to visitors. At age 13, Black Elk had also been part of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and he survived the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre.

Neihardt recounts that Black Elk invited him back for interviews. Flying Hawk served as their translator. Neihardt writes that Black Elk told him of his visions, including one in which he saw himself as a &quot;sixth grandfather&quot; - the spiritual representative of the earth and of mankind. Neihardt also states that Black Elk shared some of the Oglala rituals which he had performed as a healer, and that the two men developed a close friendship. Neihardt&#x27;s daughter, Hilda Neihardt, says Black Elk adopted her, her sister, and their father as relatives, giving each of them Lakota names.

== Controversy ==
Though Black Elk was Oglala Lakota, the book was written by Neihardt, a non-Native. While the book is lauded by non-Native audiences, and has been inspirational to many New Age groups, some Lakota people and Native American scholars do not consider the book to be representative of Lakota beliefs. They have questioned the accuracy of the account, which has elements of a collaborative autobiography, spiritual text, and other genres. The Indiana University professor Raymond DeMallie, who has studied the Lakota by cultural and linguistic resources, published &quot;The Sixth Grandfather&quot; in 1985 including the original transcripts of the conversations with Black Elk, plus his own introduction, analysis and notes. He has questioned whether Neihardt&#x27;s account is accurate and fully represents the views or words of Black Elk.

The primary criticism made by DeMallie and similar scholars is that Neihardt, as the author and editor, may have exaggerated or altered some parts of the story to make it more accessible and marketable to the intended white audience of the 1930s, or because he did not fully understand the Lakota context. Late twentieth-century editions of the book by Nebraska University Press have addressed this issue by entitling the book as &quot;Black Elk Speaks, as told through John G. Neihardt (aka &quot;Flaming Rainbow&quot;)&quot;.

== Ben Black Elk ==
After serving as translator for his father in 1931, and increasingly after his father&#x27;s death in 1950, Ben Black Elk visited local schools on the Pine Ridge Reservation to tell the traditional stories of the Lakota history and culture.

===Adaptation===

The book was adapted into a play by Christopher Sergel, &quot;John G. Neihardt&#x27;s Black Elk Speaks&quot;, in the 1970s where it was staged by the Folger Theatre in Washington, D.C., and then taken on a national tour in 1978, and later restaged in 1992 with a revised version.

Shortly after Sergel&#x27;s death, his revised version of the play “Black Elk Speaks” opened in Jan. 1995. A Denver Center Theatre Company production, its actors included Ned Romero and Peter Kelly Gaudreault. 

One of the stage presentations was the first &#x27;paying gig&#x27; for Wes Studi, with the lead played by none other than David Carradine.

<text>ZooTampa at Lowry Park (formerly known as Lowry Park Zoo or Lowry Park Zoological Garden) is a nonprofit zoo located in Tampa, Florida. In 2009, Lowry Park Zoo was voted the #1 Family Friendly Zoo in the US by Parents Magazine, and is recognized by the State of Florida as the center for Florida wildlife conservation and biodiversity (HB 457). The zoo is operated by the Lowry Park Zoological Society, an independent 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The zoo also exists as a center for conservation of endangered wildlife both locally and around the globe. Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) as well as a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG), the Florida Association of Zoos and Aquariums (FAZA) and the Florida Attractions Association (FAA).

ZooTampa traces its origins to a small animal exhibit that was located on the campus of the University of Tampa in downtown beginning in the 1930s. It moved to its current location in the Seminole Heights neighborhood 1957 and become known as the Lowry Park Zoo, with various small rides and other entertainment facilities added in the following years. The animal enclosures were run down and deemed unhealthy by the 1980s, and after several years of fundraising, the zoo was completely redesigned and rebuilt in 1987-1988. Since reopening, several new sections and attractions have been added, often with a geographic theme.

In 2018, the zoo was rebranded as &quot;ZooTampa at Lowry Park&quot; as part of another large renovation and expansion project. Nearly 1 million people visit the zoo a year to see its more than 1,300 animals.

==History==
Tampa&#x27;s first zoo was a small collection of exotic animals in Plant Park on the grounds of the University of Tampa across the Hillsborough River from downtown.

In the 1950s, city council member and (later) mayor Nick Nuccio led the push to establish a larger zoo at a more spacious location. and the city chose a plot of land across the street from existing Lowry Park, a public greenspace in the neighborhood of Seminole Heights along the Hillsborough River. The park had been created in 1925 and named after Sumter de Leon Lowry Sr., a Tampa city commissioner and gubernatorial candidate who was a somewhat controversial figure for his vocal support of segregation and his active membership in the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Lowry&#x27;s son, Sumter de Leon Lowry Jr., later made significant contributions to improve the park, including donating money to construct a bandstand and paying the purchase price for an elephant which he then donated to the zoo.
Lowry Park Zoo opened in 1957. The zoo shared the park with Fairyland, where concrete statues depicting fairy tales and nursery rhymes were along a winding maze of paths beneath the limbs of sprawling oak trees. This whimsical area was accessible via a large rainbow bridge.

As the wildlife collection grew, other attractions and rides were also added. By the early 1980s, the zoo featured a small roller coaster, a skyride, and a kid-sized train, among other kiddie rides. However, the zoo facilities were in need of repair and renovation, with the animals cramped concrete quarters so poor that the Humane Society called it &quot;one of the worst zoos in America&quot;.

After several years of fundraising and with the help and support of mayor Bob Martinez and the city of Tampa, the original Lowry Park Zoo closed on September 7, 1987 for a $20 million reconstruction in which nearly all traces of the original zoo (including Fairyland) were removed and replaced with more modern facilities. The first phase of the revamped zoo opened on March 5, 1988. Several additions and expansions since then have brought the zoo to its current configuration.

In March 2018, Joseph Couceiro, the zoo&#x27;s CEO, introduced a new logo and signage. Formerly Lowry Park Zoo, the name was changed to ZooTampa at Lowry Park to emphasize not only its connections to Tampa and the region, but the progress the area is undergoing as well. Over the next 10 years, Couceiro indicated a desire to continue to expand and redesign several zoo features.

==Exhibits==

===Asian Gardens===

One of the zoos oldest sections, the Asian Domain, was renovated and renamed the Asian Gardens in 2007. Animals in this area include the Indian rhinoceros, Malayan tigers, babirusa, Visayan warty pig, Komodo dragon, Binturongs, Lowland anoa, sun bears, gharials, Malayan tapir, and an Indonesian-themed aviary. The pagoda-like design is subtle but noticeable, giving an authentic Asian feel.

The area also has a Sulawesi aviary, which includes bleeding-heart doves, mandarin ducks, giant Asian pond turtles, and Reeve&#x27;s muntjac deer.

===Florida Wildlife Center===

The Florida Wildlife Center is an American-based exhibit that stretches across nearly a half-mile, accessible through Asian Gardens. The exhibit includes many North American species and a few Central American species (with an asian twist), including striped skunks, American alligators, a False gharial, North American black bears, a small pack of red wolves, West Indian manatees, and an Alligator snapping turtle.

It also includes a manatee education show, an aquatic center with sharks, eels, seahorses, and a wide collection of snakes, including eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, copperheads, and eastern coral snakes. A Discovery Center highlights the amphibian residents of the zoo, showcasing various species of frogs, toads and other creatures.

===Primate World===
The primate section of the zoo has every exhibit appearing to be seemingly connected by a running system of rocky waterfalls and waterways that stretch across the entire section. There is an array of great apes, including siamang gibbons, Hamadryas baboons, and Bornean orangutans. There is also a wide array of other primates, including Angolan black-and-white colobus monkeys, golden lion tamarins, ring-tailed lemurs, and mandrills.

===Wallaroo Station===

The Wallaroo Station Children&#x27;s Zoo re-opened on February 27, 2015 after its first renovation since opening in 2002. It is home to an array of Australian-native species including koalas, yellow-footed rock wallabies, Australian singing dogs and emus, along with a varying collection of cockatoos, and flying foxes.

This section of the zoo is home to an interactive bat habitat, a &quot;Flying Bananas&quot; ride, a kiddie train ride called the Overlook Express, a budgie encounter and a family roller coaster called the Tasmanian Tiger Roller Coaster. It also has splash play area for younger kids titled &quot;The Billabong&quot;.

===Safari Africa===

Shaded by acacia trees, the area is home to a safari tram ride that provides an in-depth look behind the scenes of the zoo. Martial eagles and Patas monkeys are visible only by this ride. This exhibit is home to many landmark African species, including meerkats, duikers, the Reticulated giraffe, Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra, African bush elephant, East African crowned crane, African penguins, and the southern white rhinoceros.

The Ituri Forest, a later addition to the Safari Africa section, brought in the concept of a washed-out African river bank. The area includes a wide array of species, including greater flamingos, pygmy hippopotamuses, saddle-billed storks, and shoebill storks.

In mid-to late-2014, the warthog exhibit was closed down and renovated to house Aldabra tortoises and juvenile Galapagos giant tortoises, who were previously behind-the-scenes exclusive animals.

===Main Aviary===

The main free-flight aviary, accessible nearly at the entrance, is almost hidden in overgrown brush and plants. Inside, the whole area is covered head-to-toe in free-flight birds and waterfowl, including great hornbills, red-legged seriemas, toco toucans, boat-billed herons, African openbill storks, scarlet ibises, white-faced whistling ducks, guineafowl, Raggiana Birds-of-paradise, an array of ducks and tanagers, and two-toed sloths.

==== Spirits of the Sky Raptor Show ====
This show, held twice a day at the Zooventures Theater, is an experience that provides kids and adults alike with fun facts of birds of prey and what we can do to protect them. Some of the exhibited species include the Eurasian eagle-owl, the bald eagle, and the Andean condor.

===Conservation===

The zoo has 95 Species Survival Plan projects, which includes threatened and endangered species and species of special concern. These include chimpanzees, Bornean orangutans, mandrills, siamangs, black-and-white colobus monkeys, golden lion tamarins, Indian rhinoceroses, clouded leopards, sloth bears, babirusa, red wolves, African elephants, Bali mynah, Victoria crowned pigeon, great Indian hornbills, palm cockatoo, and Komodo dragon programs.

The zoo hosts a hospital for Florida manatees in which injured animals are rehabilitated with the intent of returning them to the wild. It is the only non-profit hospital in the world specifically dedicated to critical care for injured, sick and orphaned wild manatees. The zoo works in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Florida
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to rescue, rehabilitate and release Florida’s endangered manatees. In 2012, Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo was honored with a “Significant Achievement in North American Conservation Award” for its work with manatees, presented by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

=== Rides ===
Starting with the Australia addition, Lowry Park Zoo has added several children&#x27;s rides over the years. Rides include a zoo menagerie carousel named the Jungle Carousel, a small aerial carousel-type ride known as &quot;Boomer’s Flyin’ Bananas&quot;, a kiddie train ride named the “Overland Express”, as well as a mini roller coaster called the Tasmanian Tiger Family Coaster, which was previously located at Wild Adventures Theme Park in Valdosta, Georgia.

Roaring Springs, which opened in June 2018, is a shoot the chute ride manufactured by WhiteWater West. The ride features a single three-story drop that splashes riders and onlookers standing in the attraction&#x27;s splash zone. Roaring Springs replaced the former log flume known as “Gator Falls”.

==Controversies==

===Tiger escape===
In 2006, one of the zoo&#x27;s two Sumatran tigers, a 14-year-old female named Enshala, slipped through an unlocked gate and into an area undergoing renovation. The zoo director, Lex Salisbury, defended his decision to shoot and kill the animal after attempts to tranquilize the tiger failed and the animal lurched toward the animal doctor that had shot the tranquilizer dart.

Later in 2006, a group known as &quot;Tampa&#x27;s Zoo Advocates&quot; formed. The organization seeks to improve the living conditions of the animals as well as working conditions of the employees of Lowry Park Zoo.

===Salisbury scandal===
In April 2008, 15 patas monkeys escaped from Safari Wild, a for-profit animal attraction under development east of Tampa in rural Polk County. This brought media attention to the venture, which is owned and operated by long-time Lowry Park Zoo director Lex Salisbury.

Subsequent investigations revealed many questionable transactions between Safari Wild and Lowry Park Zoo, including the transfer of over 200 zoo animals to Safari Wild, zoo funds being used to build structures on Safari Wild property, and payments from the zoo to &quot;board&quot; animals at Safari Wild. The city of Tampa, which provides a portion of the zoo&#x27;s annual budget, demanded an audit detailing the relationship between Lowry Park, Salisbury, and his outside business ventures.

The audit was released in December 2008 and disclosed many questionable dealings between the zoo and Safari Wild. It also uncovered violations of zoo policies by Salisbury, including increasing his own bonus payments, charging the zoo for personal travel, and using zoo employees for his personal work. Auditors estimated that Salisbury owed the zoo more than $200,000 and suggested a criminal investigation. On December 19, 2008, Salisbury, under pressure from the zoo&#x27;s board of directors and the city of Tampa, resigned from his position at the zoo.

As a result of possible violations of animal transfer rules and species survival plans, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended the membership of Lowry Park Zoo and of Larry Killmar, the zoo&#x27;s Director of Collections who had authorized many of Salisbury&#x27;s questionable animal transfers. Under Killmar, the zoo reorganized its internal policies over several months, and on March 27, 2009, the AZA reinstated the membership of both Lowry Park Zoo and its director of collections.

The saga came to a close in August 2009 when Salisbury and the Lowry Park Zoo board agreed to a settlement in which Salisbury paid $2,200 and agreed to return all the structures, fencing, and equipment that the zoo had built at Safari Wild but did not admit to any wrongdoing.

<text>Tina Marie Thompson (born February 10, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. Most recently, she served as the head coach of the Virginia Cavaliers women&#x27;s basketball team from 2018 to 2022. Thompson was inducted into both the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.

The first college draft pick in WNBA history, Thompson was selected first by the Houston Comets. She helped lead the Comets to four consecutive WNBA Championships in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. She won two Olympic gold medals and made nine WNBA All-Star Game appearances. Until 2017, she was the WNBA&#x27;s all-time leading scorer and, as of 2025, she ranks third in WNBA history.

==Early life and college==
Thompson was born in Los Angeles, California. She grew up playing basketball with her brother TJ and his friends at Robertson Park in West Los Angeles, California. She recorded more than 1,500 points and 1,000 rebounds in her high school career at Morningside High School in Inglewood, California, where she also played volleyball. She then went on to play basketball at the University of Southern California, where she graduated in 1997. She attended both high school and college with fellow WNBA player Lisa Leslie.

==USA Basketball==
Thompson represented the US at the 1995 World University Games held in Fukuoka, Japan, in August and September 1995. The team had a record of 5–1, securing the silver medal. The USA team won early and reached a record of 5–0 when the USA beat Yugoslavia. In the semi-final game, the USA faced Russia. The team was behind much of the first half but tied the game at the half. The USA broke the game open in the second half and won, 101–74. The gold medal match was against unbeaten Italy. The Italian team started strong, scoring 12 of the first 14 points of the contest. Sylvia Crawley scored eight consecutive points to end the first half, but that left the USA nine points behind. The USA took a small lead in the second half, but the team from Italy responded with a ten-point run, and won the game and the gold medal by a score of 73–65. Thompson averaged 9.9 points per game and was second on the team with 7.3 rebounds per game.

Thompson was invited to be a member of the Jones Cup team representing the US in 1996. She helped the team to a 9–0 record, and the gold medal in the event. In the game against Slovakia, which would determine the gold medal, she combined with teammate Michelle M. Marciniak to score 30 points in a game they had to come from behind to win 72–62. Thompson averaged 9.6 points per game and 6.2 rebounds, both second highest on the team.

Thompson was selected to be a member of the National team for 1998 World Championships, but was injured and unable to compete.

Thompson was named to the national team representing the US at the 2006 World Championships, held in Barueri and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The team won eight of their nine contests, but the lone loss came in the semifinal medal round to Russia. The USA beat Brazil in the final game to earn the bronze medal. Thompson led all scorers with 14.4 points per game. In a game against Russia, she tied a team record by hitting four of four three-point attempts.

Thompson also played for Team USA in the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics, winning two Olympic gold medals with the team.

==WNBA career==
Thompson was selected No. 1 overall in the first round of the inaugural 1997 WNBA draft by the Houston Comets. There, she was a member of a dynasty along with Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia Cooper that won four consecutive WNBA championships from 1997 to 2000. During her stint with the Comets, Thompson had won All-Star MVP honors at the 2000 WNBA All-Star Game, led all Western Conference players in All-Star voting in 2001, had been named to the All-WNBA First Team three times (1997, 1998, 2004) and All-WNBA Second Team four times (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002).

Prior to the 2005 season, Thompson had given birth to Dyllan Thompson-Jones, her first child in May, with then NBA player Damon Jones being the biological father; she resumed playing with the Comets two months later. Following her pregnancy she had a sluggish season in 2005, averaging only 10.1 ppg.

In 2006, Thompson returned to peak condition, averaging 18.7 ppg and scored a career-high 37 points in a triple-overtime loss to the Phoenix Mercury. That year the Comets made the playoffs for the final time before folding, after they were eliminated in a two-game sweep by the Sacramento Monarchs in the first round.

After the Comets folded in 2008, Thompson signed with her hometown team, the Los Angeles Sparks in 2009, playing alongside Candace Parker and Lisa Leslie who was playing in her final year before retirement. Thompson, Leslie and Parker led the Sparks to the playoffs with an 18–16 record. In the playoffs, Thompson was one win away from her fifth Finals appearance but the Sparks lost 2–1 in the second round to the Phoenix Mercury, who were the champions that year. During the following season in August, Thompson became the WNBA&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, passing Lisa Leslie during a regular-season game loss to the San Antonio Silver Stars in which she scored 23 points. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA.

An unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2011 season, Thompson signed with the Seattle Storm on February 27, 2012, to fill gaps left by Australia&#x27;s Lauren Jackson, concurrent her commitment to the Australian national team for the 2012 Olympics, and small forward Swin Cash, who was traded to the Chicago Sky as part of a package deal for the second-overall pick in the 2012 WNBA draft.

On May 31, 2013, Thompson announced that she would retire from the WNBA at the end of the 2013 season.

During the 2013 season, the 38-year-old Thompson was a starter for the Storm and had averaged 14.1 ppg. She was also selected to the 2013 WNBA All-Star Game to replace an injured Brittney Griner. It was her ninth career WNBA All-Star Game appearance, the second-most in WNBA history, and it also made her the first and only player in WNBA history to be named an All-Star in three different decades.

On August 17, 2013, Thompson became the first WNBA player to have 7,000 points and 3,000 rebounds following a victory against the Indiana Fever where she scored 23 points and grabbed 7 rebounds.

September 14, 2013, marked the final regular-season game of Thompson&#x27;s career which resulted in a victory over the Tulsa Shock. Following the game, an almost hour-long retirement ceremony took place in her honor. Her Storm teammates all wore a number 7 jersey either in a Comets or Storm variant. Despite the absence of Sue Bird who sat out the whole season while recovering from knee surgery, the Storm made the playoffs with the number 4 seed in the Western Conference.

Thompson&#x27;s final WNBA career game was Game 2 of the first round in the 2013 WNBA Playoffs. The Storm were eliminated in a two-game sweep by the Minnesota Lynx who would win the championship that year. Thompson scored 13 points in the loss.

In 2016, Thompson was again honored by the WNBA, being named in the WNBA Top 20@20 in celebration of the league&#x27;s twentieth anniversary.

On March 31, 2018, Thompson was named to the 2018 class of inductees for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1207083" wikidata="Q6640046" url="?curid=1207083" title="List of songs recorded by Phish">
<text>This is an incomplete list of original songs composed by the rock band Phish. Certain &quot;sections&quot; of songs have been played separately from time to time, but are not listed below. For instance, the middle section of &quot;Guelah Papyrus&quot; was sometimes played by itself under the name &quot;The Asse Festival.” Before &quot;The Moma Dance&quot; had lyrics, it was called &quot;Black-Eyed Katy.” “Shafty&quot; was once called &quot;Olivia&#x27;s Pool,” and featured a different arrangement. &quot;Taste&quot; was once known as &quot;The Fog That Surrounds&quot; and contained a slightly different arrangement. And many sections of the multi-part epic &quot;Fluffhead&quot; have been played outside of the song. Some of these sections include &quot;Clod&quot;, &quot;The Chase&quot;, &quot;Who Do? We Do!!&quot; and &quot;Bundle of Joy.” Phish also performed several songs by The Dude of Life, a friend and collaborator of the band, but those are not listed here, with the exception of songs that The Dude of Life purposely gave to Phish for use in their catalog. Also, songs from the band&#x27;s solo careers that were also performed by Phish are listed here.

<doc id="1207087" wikidata="Q4820263" url="?curid=1207087" title="Audubon Zoo">
<text>Audubon Zoo is an American zoo located in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is part of the Audubon Nature Institute which also manages Audubon Aquarium, Audubon Louisiana Nature Center, Freeport-McMoran Species Survival Center, Audubon Park, and Audubon Coastal Wildlife Network. It covers and is home to over 2,000 animals. It is located in a section of Audubon Park in Uptown New Orleans, on the Mississippi River side of Magazine Street. The zoo and park are named in honor of artist and naturalist John James Audubon who lived in New Orleans starting in 1821.

==History==

The site of the zoo has housed animal exhibits since the World Cotton Centennial 1884 Exhibition World&#x27;s Fair, though the current incarnation of the zoo was not built until the early 20th century. In 1916, a flight cage was added, and during the boom of the 1920s, many other additions were made, such as a sea lion pool in 1928. This pool, along with a few other &quot;art nouveau&quot; buildings, can still be seen today.
During the Great Depression, a $400,000 expansion of the zoo was conducted by the Works Progress Administration. Many new cages were constructed, along with an artificial hill known as &quot;Monkey Hill&quot;, built as an attraction for children in the relatively flat New Orleans area. Locals claim Monkey Hill to be the highest point in New Orleans, although another artificial hill in City Park actually competes for that title.

By the early 1970s, the zoo had fallen into a state of decay. The small prison-like cages made of bricks and steel bars constructed by the WPA were no longer considered appropriate environments for many of the animals displayed within them. A study suggested that the zoo should be closed down unless the city could make a major commitment to upgrade it. City government, local businesses, and private citizens rallied in support of it, and in 1975 the city&#x27;s voters approved a measure to finance its rebuilding. Zoo grounds were expanded from 14 to 50 acres (57,000 to 200,000 m2). That same year, New Orleans funk band The Meters released the song &quot;They All Ask&#x27;d for You,&quot; which references Audubon Zoo and has become the zoo&#x27;s unofficial theme song. By the end of the decade, the Audubon Zoo was already well on its way to becoming one of the finest in the United States.
More improvements and expansions continued into the 21st century, making the Audubon Zoo popular not only with locals but also drawing substantial numbers of tourists visiting from other states and from abroad.

In 1987, an alligator nest was discovered with 18 freshly hatched babies with white hides—an extraordinary natural mutation called leucism, not to be confused with albinism. They received much attention when they went on display, and the white alligator became a symbol of the zoo.
In 1990, the Audubon Nature Institute, which manages the zoo, opened Audubon Aquarium in the CBD at the edge of the French Quarter. Some of the white alligators were transferred there, and a riverboat began service taking visitors between the facilities.

The WPA-era Monkey Hill, a favorite landmark of generations of New Orleans children, underwent extensive renovation in the early 21st century, including the addition of a waterfall for young children to play in, a rope web that goes to the summit, and a &quot;safari outpost&quot; at the base of the hill. For the sake of posterity, a portion of it was left as grass for children to play on.

In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, followed by severe consequences in the devastating aftermath of the storm. During the hurricane, zoo staff found refuge in the reptile house, which was designed to withstand major weather events. Located on high ground atop an old natural river levee, the building was not flooded. Most of the animals survived—only three died—and the only major damage was downed trees. However, the zoo was short on food and other necessities in the days after the storm, and pumps were overheating.

The fact that the zoo sustained only minor damage can be attributed to disaster planning and its location on high ground. Zoo curator Dan Maloney was quoted as saying, &quot;The zoo had planned for years for the catastrophic storm that has long been predicted for New Orleans.&quot;

The zoo reopened for Thanksgiving weekend in November 2005 and initiated a weekends-only schedule due to financial constraints. On March 1, 2006, it began a Wednesday-through-Sunday schedule, and eventually expanded to Tuesday through Sunday.

For a period around 2011 the Lycée Français de la Nouvelle-Orléans (LFNO) used three rooms at the zoo as classrooms on a temporary basis.

On July 14, 2018, a jaguar named Valerio escaped through the roof of its enclosure, killing six animals and injuring another three before being recaptured. The incident occurred before the zoo had opened.

==Notable attractions==
Near the entrance are exhibits for American flamingos and whooping cranes.

===Asian Domain===

Home to the zoo&#x27;s Asian animals. Sumatran orangutans are housed in the former elephant yard. The zoo&#x27;s Asian elephants live in a few large yards with enrichment structures and pools. Also living in this area are Amur leopards, sun bears, Asian small-clawed otters, North Sulawesi babirusa, Malayan tigers and barasingha.

===World of Primates===
World of Primates houses a variety of primates like a troop of western lowland gorillas, mandrills, black-and-white colobus monkeys, Wolf&#x27;s guenons, black howler monkeys, golden lion tamarin, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, siamang and the only Angolan talapoins in North America.

===African Savanna===

In front of the Savanna is the zoo&#x27;s petting zoo, the Watoto Walk, which houses donkeys, miniature zebu, goats and sheep. The first enclosure in the Savanna consists of giraffes, black crowned cranes and marabou storks. Nearby are habitats for African wild dogs and lions. A paddock with a large pond houses great white pelicans and pink-backed pelicans along with Thomson&#x27;s gazelles, nyala and Abyssinian ground hornbills. A third habitat houses white rhinos, Burchell&#x27;s zebras and blue wildebeest while the final habitat houses red river hogs.

===South American Pampas===

At the entrance of this area is the maned wolf enclosure. Right over is a boardwalk across a large pond which houses Caribbean flamingos, American white pelicans and brown pelicans. Along the boardwalk is a large yard for capybaras, greater rheas, king vultures and Patagonian maras. The yard across has Baird&#x27;s tapirs, guanacos and coscoroba swans.

===Jaguar Jungle===
This area has the theme of a ruined Mayan temple and it includes jaguars, giant anteaters, St. Vincent agoutis, ocelots, Geoffroy&#x27;s spider monkeys, alpacas, maguari storks, scarlet macaws, blue-and-yellow macaws and common boa.

A new nocturnal house named &quot;Criaturas de la Noche&quot; was opened in 2019 featuring Seba&#x27;s short-tailed bats, Nancy Ma&#x27;s night monkeys, ringtails, common vampire bats, Anthony&#x27;s poison arrow frogs, red-eyed tree frogs, Central American giant cave cockroaches and Costa Rican zebra tarantulas.

===Audubon Aviary===
This free-flight aviary features more than 30 species of birds from around the world such as the blue-crowned laughingthrushes, Indian peafowl, Nicobar pigeons, scarlet ibises and Taveta golden weavers. Outside the aviary is a yard for emus.

===Louisiana Swamp===

This exhibit is primarily outdoors, housing many samples of animals native to southern Louisiana. These include American black bears, cougars, bobcats, red foxes, North American river otters, nutria, raccoons, various fish and snakes, blue crabs, alligator snapping turtles and American alligators of both normal pigmentation and the leucistic variety.

After Hurricane Katrina, it was thematically decorated to mimic the scenes seen around the city. There was a small Katrina refrigerator taped up outside of the front door, a blue tarp stretched over the roof, and a marking that indicated no casualties were found in it, rather, that the eight alligators that inhabit it were fed with the notion of the number 8 and &quot;Gators Fed&quot;.

===Reptile Encounter===
One of the newer and more famous residents of the Reptile Encounter exhibit is the Komodo dragon. Many other animals are also housed here, including the panther chameleon, Gila monster, false gharial, green anaconda, gaboon viper and quite a few other reptiles and amphibians.

===Sea Lion Theater===
California sea lions live in a large lagoon. Two females named Ayah and Jolee arrived at the zoo in 2017 from the Marine Mammal Care Center Los Angeles. Both were found stranded and were rescued; Jolee was suffering from cataracts and flipper abrasions and Ayah had a small-caliber bullet in her brain, resulting in the loss of her left eye.
