<text>Body painting is a form of body art where artwork is painted directly onto the human skin. Unlike tattoos and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, lasting several hours or sometimes up to a few weeks (in the case of mehndi or &quot;henna tattoos&quot; about two weeks). Body painting that is limited to the face is known as face painting. Body painting is also referred to as (a form of) &quot;temporary tattoo&quot;. Large scale or full-body painting is more commonly referred to as body painting, while smaller or more detailed work can sometimes be referred to as temporary tattoos.

==Indigenous==

Body painting with a grey or white paint made from natural pigments including clay, chalk, ash and cattle dung is traditional in many tribal cultures. Often worn during cultural ceremonies, it is believed to assist with the moderation of body heat and the use of striped patterns may reduce the incidence of biting insects. It still survives in this ancient form among Indigenous Australians and in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, as well as in New Zealand and the Pacific islands. A semi-permanent form of body painting known as &quot;Mehndi&quot;, using dyes made of henna leaves (hence also known rather erroneously as &quot;henna tattoo&quot;), is practiced in India, especially on brides. Since the late 1990s, Mehndi has become popular amongst young women in the Western world.

Many indigenous peoples of Central and South America paint jagua tattoos, or designs with &quot;Genipa americana&quot; juice on their bodies. Indigenous peoples of South America traditionally use annatto, huito, or wet charcoal to decorate their faces and bodies. Huito is semi-permanent, and it generally takes weeks for this black dye to fade.

==Western==
Body painting is not always large pieces on fully nude bodies, but can involve smaller pieces on displayed areas of otherwise clothed bodies. There has been a revival of body painting in Western society since the 1960s, in part prompted by the liberalization of social mores regarding nudity and often comes in sensationalist or exhibitionist forms. Even today there is a constant debate about the legitimacy of body painting as an art form. The current modern revival could be said to date back to the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago when Max Factor Sr. and his model Sally Rand were arrested for causing a public disturbance when he body-painted her with his new make-up formulated for Hollywood films. Body art today evolves to the works more directed towards personal mythologies, as Jana Sterbak, Rebecca Horn, Michel Platnic, Youri Messen-Jaschin or Javier Perez.
Body painting is sometimes used as a method of gaining attention in political protests, for instance those by PETA against Burberry.

Body painting led to a minor alternative art movement in the 1950s and 1960s, which involved covering a model in paint and then having the model touch or roll on a canvas or other medium to transfer the paint. French artist Yves Klein is perhaps the most famous for this, with his series of paintings &quot;Anthropometries&quot;. The effect produced by this technique creates an image-transfer from the model&#x27;s body to the medium. This includes all the curves of the model&#x27;s body (typically female) being reflected in the outline of the image. This technique was not necessarily monotone; multiple colors on different body parts sometimes produced interesting effects.

Joanne Gair is a body paint artist whose work appeared for the tenth consecutive year in the 2008 &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;. She came to prominence with an August 1992 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; &quot;Demi&#x27;s Birthday Suit&quot; cover of Demi Moore. Her &quot;Disappearing Model&quot; was part of an episode of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;.

===Festivals===

Body painting festivals happen annually across the world, bringing together professional body painters and keen amateurs. Body painting can also be seen at some football matches, at rave parties, and at certain festivals. The World Bodypainting Festival is a three-day festival which originated in 1998 and which has been held in Klagenfurt, Austria since 2017. Participants attend from over fifty countries and the event has more than 20,000 visitors; the associated World Bodypainting Association promotes the art of bodypainting.

Body painting festivals that take place in North America include the North American Body Painting Championship, Face and Body Art International Convention in Orlando, Florida, Bodygras Body Painting Competition in Nanaimo, BC and the Face Painting and Body Art Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Australia also has a number of body painting festivals, most notably the annual Australian Body Art Festival in Eumundi, Queensland and the Australian Body Art Awards.

In Italy, the Rabarama Skin Art Festival (held every year during the Summer and Autumn, with a tour in the major Italian cities), is a different event focused on the artistic side of body painting, highlighting the emotional impact of the painted body in a live performance more than the decorative and technical aspects of it. This particular form of creative art is known as &quot;Skin Art&quot;.

===Fine art===

The 1960s supermodel Veruschka has inspired bodypaint artists, after influential images of her appeared in the 1986 book &quot;Transfigurations&quot; by photographer Holger Trulzsch. Other well-known works include Serge Diakonoff&#x27;s books &quot;A Fleur de Peau&quot; and &quot;Diakonoff&quot; and Joanne Gair&#x27;s &quot;Paint a licious&quot;. More recently Dutch art photographer Karl Hammer has taken center stage with his combinations of body painting and narrative art (fantastic realism).

Following the already established trend in Western-Europe, body painting has become more widely accepted in the United States since the early 1990s. In 2006 the first gallery dedicated exclusively to fine art body painting was opened in New Orleans by World Bodypainting Festival Champion and Judge, Craig Tracy. The Painted Alive Gallery is on Royal Street in the French Quarter. In 2009, a popular late night talk show &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; on NBC network, featured a New York-based artist Danny Setiawan who creates reproductions of masterpieces by famous artists such as Salvador Dalí, Vincent van Gogh, and Gustav Klimt on human bodies aiming to make fine art appealing for his contemporaries who normally would not consider themselves as art enthusiasts.

Since 2005 the Australian visual artist Emma Hack has been creating photographs of painted naked human bodies that visually merge with a patterned background wall inspired by the wallpaper designs of Florence Broadhurst. Hack is best known for the Gotye music video for the song &quot;Somebody That I Used to Know&quot;, which uses stop-motion animation body painting and has received over 800 million views on YouTube. Hack now creates her own canvas backgrounds and her work is often featured with live birds, representing nature. Hack&#x27;s artworks are exhibited worldwide.

Michel Platnic is a French–Israeli contemporary visual artist. He is known for his &quot;living paintings&quot;. He uses multiple mediums including photography, video, performance body-painting and painting . Platnic builds three-dimensional cinema sets that are a backdrop for his video and photography works and then he paints directly on the body of the living models he places within the sets. Using this technique, Platnic brought to life several scenes of paintings made famous by artists Francis Bacon, Egon Schiele, David Hockney and Lucian Freud and placed them in a different context. 
Los Angeles artist, Paul Roustan, is known for his work in body painting and photography which spans both the fine art and commercial worlds. His body painting has garnered numerous awards, including winner of the North American Body Paint Championships.

Trina Merry is a body painter known for camouflaging models into settings, backgrounds and, in her &quot;Lust of Currency&quot; series, famous paintings. Merry&#x27;s collection was exhibited during Miami Art Basel in 2017 and at the Superfine! New York art fair in May 2018.

Peruvian artist Cecilia Paredes is known for her style of painting her own body to camouflage herself against complex floral backgrounds and natural landscapes.

===In the commercial arena===

Many artists work professionally as body painters for television commercials, such as the Natrel Plus campaign featuring models camouflaged as trees. Stills advertising also used body painting with hundreds of body painting looks on the pages of the world&#x27;s magazines every year. Body painters also work frequently in the film arena especially in science fiction with an increasing number of elaborate alien creations being body painted.

The &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;, published annually, has frequently featured a section of models that were body painted, attired in renditions of swimsuits or sports jerseys. Also &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine has frequently made use of body painted models. In the 2005 &quot;Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion&quot; calendar, all Playmates appeared in the calendar wearing bikinis, but Playmates Karen McDougal and Hiromi Oshima actually appeared in painted-on bikinis for their respective months.

The success of body painting has led to many notable international competitions and a specific trade magazine (&quot;Illusion Magazine&quot;) for this industry, showcasing work around the world.

==Face painting==

Face painting is the artistic application of nontoxic paint to a person&#x27;s face. The practice dates from Paleolithic times and has been used for ritual purposes, such as coming-of-age ceremonies and funeral rites, as well as for hunting. Materials such as clay, chalk or henna have been used, typically mixed with pigments extracted from leaves, fruits or berries and sometimes with oils or fats.

Many peoples around the world practice face painting in modern times. This includes indigenous peoples in places such as Australia, Papua New Guinea, Polynesia and Melanesia. Some tribes in Sub-Saharan Africa use the technique during rituals and festivals, and many of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America now use it for ceremonies, having previously also used it for hunting and warfare. In India it is used in folk dances and temple festivals, such as in Kathakali performances, and Mehndi designs are used at weddings. It is also used by Japanese Geisha and Chinese opera singers. Women in Madagascar paint their faces with designs featuring stars, flowers and leaves using contrasting yellow and white wood paste called masonjoany.

In some forms of Western folk dance, such as Border Morris, the faces of the dancers are painted with a black pigment in a tradition that goes back to the Middle Ages. In the 18th century cosmetic face painting became popular with men and women of the aristocracy and the nouveau riche, but it died out in Western culture after the fall of the French aristocracy. During the 19th century blackface theatrical makeup gained popularity when it was used by non-black performers to represent black people, typically in a minstrel show. Its use ended in the United States with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. At about the same time the hippie movement adopted face painting, and it was common for young people to decorate their cheeks with flowers or peace symbols at anti-war demonstrations.

In contemporary Western culture face painting has become an art form, with artists displaying their work at festivals and in competitions and magazines. Other western users include actors and clowns, and it continues to be used as a form of camouflage amongst hunters and the military. It is also found at entertainments for children and sports events.

For several decades it has been a common entertainment at county fairs, large open-air markets (especially in Europe and the Americas), and other locations that attract children and adolescents. Face painting is very popular among children at theme parks, parties and festivals throughout the Western world. Though the majority of face painting is geared towards children, many teenagers and adults enjoy being painted for special events, such as sports events (to give support to their team or country) or charity fund raisers.

===In the military===

It is common in armies all over the world for soldiers in combat to paint their faces and other exposed body parts (hands, for example) in natural colors such as green, tan, and loam for camouflage purposes. In various South American armies, it is a tradition to use face paint on parade in respect to the indigenous tribes.

==Temporary tattoos==
As well as paint, temporary tattoos can be used to decorate the body. &quot;Glitter tattoos&quot; are made by applying a clear, cosmetic-grade glue (either freehand or through a stencil) on the skin and then coating it with cosmetic-grade glitter. They can last up to a week depending on the model&#x27;s body chemistry.

Foil metallic temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using foil stamping technique instead of ink. On the front side, the foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.

==Body paints==
Modern water-based face and body paints are made according to stringent guidelines, meaning these are non-toxic, usually non-allergenic, and can easily be washed away. Temporary staining may develop after use, but it will fade after normal washing. These are either applied with hands, paint brush, and synthetic sponges or natural sea sponge, or alternatively with an airbrush.
Contrary to the popular myth perpetuated by the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, a person is not asphyxiated if their whole body is painted.

Liquid latex may also be used as body paint. Aside the risk of contact allergy, wearing latex for a prolonged period may cause heat stroke by inhibiting perspiration and care should be taken to avoid the painful removal of hair when the latex is pulled off.

The same precautions that apply to cosmetics should be observed. If the skin shows any sign of allergy from a paint, its use should immediately be ceased. Moreover, it should not be applied to damaged, inflamed or sensitive skin. If possible, a test for allergic reaction should be performed before use. Special care should be paid to the list of ingredients, as certain dyes are not approved by the US FDA for use around the eye area—generally those associated with certain reddish colorants, as CI 15850 or CI 15985—or on lips, generally blue, purple or some greens containing CI 77007. More stringent regulations are in place in California regarding the amount of permissible lead on cosmetic additives, as part of Proposition 65. In the European Union, all colorants listed under a CI number are allowed for use on all areas. Any paints or products which have not been formulated for use on the body should never be used for body or face painting, as these can result in serious allergic reactions.

As for Mehndi, natural brown henna dyes are safe to use when mixed with ingredients such as lemon juice. Another option is Jagua, a dark indigo plant-based dye that is safe to use on the skin and is approved for cosmetic use in the EU.

==Body marbling==

Hands and faces can be marbled temporarily for events such as festivals, using a painting process similar to traditional paper marbling, in which paint is floated on water and transferred to a person&#x27;s skin. Unlike the traditional oil-based technique for paper, neon or ultraviolet reactive colours are typically used, and the paint is water-based and non-toxic.

==Hand art==
&quot;Hand art&quot; is the application of make-up or paint to a hand to make it appear like an animal or other object. Some hand artists, like Guido Daniele, produce images that are &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; representations of wild animals painted on people&#x27;s hands.

Hand artists work closely with hand models. Hand models can be booked through specialist acting and modeling agencies usually advertising under &quot;body part model&quot; or &quot;hands and feet models&quot;.

==Body glitter==
The application of glitter and reflective ornaments to a woman&#x27;s breasts, often in the shape of a bikini top or crop top and sometimes alongside nipple tassels, is known as glitter boobs. Like body paint, this decoration is popular with festivalgoers. Buttocks are also sometimes decorated in a similar manner, and the adornment of the a woman&#x27;s pubic area is known as a vajazzle.

==Media==

Body painting features in various media. The popular TV variety show, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, featured bodies painted with comedic phrases and jokes during transitions. &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, a 1996 film by Peter Greenaway, is centred on body painting. The 1990 American film &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; featured several examples of models who were painted to blend into elaborate backdrops as &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;. &quot;Skin Wars&quot; is a body painting reality competition hosted by Rebecca Romijn that premiered on Game Show Network on August 6, 2014.

<text>Codeine/paracetamol, also called codeine/acetaminophen and co-codamol, is a compound analgesic, comprising codeine phosphate and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Codeine/paracetamol is used for the relief of mild to moderate pain when paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; such as ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen) alone do not sufficiently relieve symptoms.

In 2022, it was the 166th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects include constipation, nausea and drowsiness.
Others include coughing up blood from the lungs, skin rashes, dizziness, sedation, shortness of breath, hypersensitivity reaction, fainting (syncope or near syncope), confusion, loss of short-term memory, changes in blood, allergic reactions, euphoria, dysphoria, abdominal pain, itchiness, easy bruising, bleeding gums, vivid dreams, dry mouth and addiction.

Genetic differences between people cause differing rates of metabolism of codeine to morphine. In about 5 percent of people this may happen particularly fast, causing morphine to be passed through breast milk in amounts that may cause fatal respiratory depression in a breastfed baby.

== Society and culture ==
=== Availability ===
Of the European Union member states, eleven allow over-the-counter sale of solid dosage forms of codeine, including codeine/paracetamol: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia.

<text>Co-codaprin (BAN) is a compound analgesic, a combination of codeine phosphate with aspirin.

Co-codaprin tablets are used for mild to moderate pain.

==Preparations==
===Canada===
AC&amp;C is a related preparation of aspirin, codeine phosphate, and caffeine in tablet form. The caffeine is intended to counteract drowsiness which may be caused by the codeine.

AC&amp;C is available in different formulations containing varying amounts of codeine. Formulations containing 8 mg or less of codeine (&quot;AC&amp;C 8&quot; or &quot;222&quot;) are typically available from pharmacies over the counter. A prescription is not required, but the medication must be requested from the pharmacist. The &quot;222&quot; and higher numbers refer to the codeine narcotic content numbers as follows:
* 222 - contains 7.5 mg codeine
* 282 - contains 15 mg codeine
* 292 - contains 30 mg codeine
* 293 - contains 60 mg codeine

<text>In mathematics, the Jacobian conjecture is a famous unsolved problem concerning polynomials in several variables. It states that if a polynomial function from an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space to itself has Jacobian determinant which is a non-zero constant, then the function has a polynomial inverse. It was first conjectured in 1939 by Ott-Heinrich Keller, and widely publicized by Shreeram Abhyankar, as an example of a difficult question in algebraic geometry that can be understood using little beyond a knowledge of calculus.

The Jacobian conjecture is notorious for the large number of attempted proofs that turned out to contain subtle errors. As of 2018, there are no plausible claims to have proved it. Even the two-variable case has resisted all efforts. There are currently no known compelling reasons for believing the conjecture to be true, and according to van den Essen there are some suspicions that the conjecture is in fact false for large numbers of variables (indeed, there is equally also no compelling evidence to support these suspicions). The Jacobian conjecture is number 16 in Stephen Smale&#x27;s 1998 list of Mathematical Problems for the Next Century.

==The Jacobian determinant==
Let &quot;N&quot; &gt; 1 be a fixed integer and consider polynomials &quot;f&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;N&quot; in variables &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot; with coefficients in a field &quot;k&quot;. Then we define a vector-valued function &quot;F&quot;: &quot;kN&quot; → &quot;k&quot;&quot;N&quot; by setting:

: &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot;) = (&quot;f&quot;1(&quot;X&quot;1, ...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot;)..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;N&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot;)).

Any map &quot;F&quot;: &quot;kN&quot; → &quot;k&quot;&quot;N&quot; arising in this way is called a polynomial mapping.

The Jacobian determinant of &quot;F&quot;, denoted by &quot;JF&quot;, is defined as the determinant of the &quot;N&quot; × &quot;N&quot; Jacobian matrix consisting of the partial derivatives of &quot;fi&quot; with respect to &quot;Xj&quot;:

:formula_1

then &quot;JF&quot; is itself a polynomial function of the &quot;N&quot; variables &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;XN&quot;.

==Formulation of the conjecture==
It follows from the multivariable chain rule that if &quot;F&quot; has a polynomial inverse function &quot;G&quot;: &quot;kN&quot; → &quot;kN&quot;, then &quot;JF&quot; has a polynomial reciprocal, so is a nonzero constant. The Jacobian conjecture is the following partial converse:

Jacobian conjecture: Let &quot;k&quot; have characteristic 0. If &quot;JF&quot; is a non-zero constant, then &quot;F&quot; has an inverse function &quot;G&quot;: &quot;kN&quot; → &quot;kN&quot; which is regular, meaning its components are polynomials.

According to van den Essen, the problem was first conjectured by Keller in 1939 for the limited case of two variables and integer coefficients.

The obvious analogue of the Jacobian conjecture fails if &quot;k&quot; has characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 even for one variable. The characteristic of a field, if it is not zero, must be prime, so at least 2. The polynomial has derivative which is 1 (because &quot;px&quot; is 0) but it has no inverse function. However, suggested extending the Jacobian conjecture to characteristic by adding the hypothesis that &quot;p&quot; does not divide the degree of the field extension .

The existence of a polynomial inverse is obvious if &quot;F&quot; is simply a set of functions linear in the variables, because then the inverse will also be a set of linear functions. A simple non-linear example is given by

:formula_2
:formula_3

so that the Jacobian determinant is

:formula_4

In this case the inverse exists as the polynomials

:formula_5
:formula_6

But if we modify &quot;F&quot; slightly, to

:formula_7
:formula_3

then the determinant is

:formula_9

which is not constant, and the Jacobian conjecture does not apply.
The function still has an inverse:

:formula_10
:formula_11

but the expression for &quot;x&quot; is not a polynomial.

The condition &quot;JF&quot; ≠ 0 is related to the inverse function theorem in multivariable calculus. In fact for smooth functions (and so in particular for polynomials) a smooth local inverse function to &quot;F&quot; exists at every point where &quot;JF&quot; is non-zero. For example, the map x → &quot;x&quot; + &quot;x&quot;3 has a smooth global inverse, but the inverse is not polynomial.

==Results==
Stuart Sui-Sheng Wang proved the Jacobian conjecture for polynomials of degree 2. Hyman Bass, Edwin Connell, and David Wright showed that the general case follows from the special case where the polynomials are of degree 3, or even more specifically, of cubic homogeneous type, meaning of the form &quot;F&quot; = (&quot;X&quot;1 + &quot;H&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; + &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;), where each &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; is either zero or a homogeneous cubic. Ludwik Drużkowski showed that one may further assume that the map is of cubic linear type, meaning that the nonzero &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; are cubes of homogeneous linear polynomials. It seems that Drużkowski&#x27;s reduction is one most promising way to go forward. These reductions introduce additional variables and so are not available for fixed &quot;N&quot;.

Edwin Connell and Lou van den Dries proved that if the Jacobian conjecture is false, then it has a counterexample with integer coefficients and Jacobian determinant 1. In consequence, the Jacobian conjecture is true either for all fields of characteristic 0 or for none. For fixed dimension &quot;N&quot;, it is true if it holds for at least one algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.

Let &quot;k&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] denote the polynomial ring and &quot;k&quot;[&quot;F&quot;] denote the &quot;k&quot;-subalgebra generated by &quot;f&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For a given &quot;F&quot;, the Jacobian conjecture is true if, and only if, . Keller (1939) proved the birational case, that is, where the two fields &quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;k&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) are equal. The case where &quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a Galois extension of &quot;k&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) was proved by Andrew Campbell for complex maps and in general by Michael Razar and, independently, by David Wright. Tzuong-Tsieng Moh checked the conjecture for polynomials of degree at most 100 in two variables.

Michiel de Bondt and Arno van den Essen and Ludwik Drużkowski independently showed that it is enough to prove the Jacobian Conjecture for complex maps of cubic homogeneous type with a symmetric Jacobian matrix, and further showed that the conjecture holds for maps of cubic linear type with a symmetric Jacobian matrix, over any field of characteristic 0.

The strong real Jacobian conjecture was that a real polynomial map with a nowhere vanishing Jacobian determinant has a smooth global inverse. That is equivalent to asking whether such a map is topologically a proper map, in which case it is a covering map of a simply connected manifold, hence invertible. Sergey Pinchuk constructed two variable counterexamples of total degree 35 and higher.

It is well known that the Dixmier conjecture implies the Jacobian conjecture. Conversely, it is shown by Yoshifumi Tsuchimoto and independently by Alexei Belov-Kanel and Maxim Kontsevich that the Jacobian conjecture for &quot;2N&quot; variables implies the Dixmier conjecture in &quot;N&quot; dimensions. A self-contained and purely algebraic proof of the last implication is also given by Kossivi Adjamagbo and Arno van den Essen who also proved in the same paper that these two conjectures are equivalent to the Poisson conjecture.

<text>Graham Douglas Leonard (8 May 1921 – 6 January 2010) was an English Roman Catholic priest and former Anglican bishop. His principal ministry was as a bishop of the Church of England but, after his retirement as the Bishop of London, he became a Roman Catholic, becoming the most senior Anglican cleric to do so since the English Reformation. He was conditionally ordained to the priesthood in the Roman Catholic Church and was later appointed a monsignor by Pope John Paul II.

==Early life==
Born on 8 May 1921, Leonard was the son of Douglas Leonard, an Anglican priest, and his wife Emily Leonard (née Cheshire). He was educated at Monkton Combe School near Bath and at Balliol College, Oxford. During the Second World War he was commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, rising to the rank of captain. He spent the latter part of the war attached to the Army Operational Research Group for the Ministry of Supply. He then attended Westcott House theological college in Cambridge. He was ordained as a deacon in 1947 and as a priest the following year.

==Early ministry==
Leonard was a curate in St Ives, Huntingdonshire, and at Stansted, Essex. He then spent three years as vicar of Ardleigh, Essex. In 1957 he became a residentiary canon of St Albans Cathedral and the diocesan director of religious education. His long association with the Diocese of London began in 1962 when, before becoming the Bishop of Willesden (a suffragan bishopric in the diocese) in 1964, he was appointed as Archdeacon of Hampstead and as rector of St Andrew Undershaft with St Mary Axe in the City of London.

==Episcopal ministry==
Leonard had three episcopal positions in the Church of England, firstly as the suffragan Bishop of Willesden in the Diocese of London and later as the diocesan Bishop of Truro (1973 to 1981) and the Bishop of London (1981 to 1991). During this last period he was also Dean of the Chapel Royal, a Royal Household office, for which he was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO). He was also Prelate of the Order of the British Empire.

As the Bishop of London, Leonard was admired for his pastoral concern for female staff at Church House and had a considerable number of female workers in parishes in his diocese. He was notable for ordaining 71 women as deacons at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 22 March 1987, but he remained an outspoken critic of moves to ordain women to the priesthood within the Anglican Communion.

In 1989, Leonard co-authored a book titled &quot;Let God be God&quot; with two Anglican theologians examining the issue of inclusive language in the church, giving particular attention to inclusive God language, of which they were especially critical:
this God and Lord ... is revealed to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Try as we may, we cannot see how we can accept God&#x27;s self-revelation without also accepting that God has chosen to use certain male symbols and male language to express to us the kind of God &#x27;he&#x27; is. To cease to use these terms is, to us, to discard that revelation.&quot;

Leonard retired during May 1991.

==Ordination in the Roman Catholic Church==
After his retirement Leonard eventually left the Church of England to become a Roman Catholic. On 23 April 1994 he was conditionally ordained as a priest (but not as a bishop) in the Roman Catholic Church. Although the Roman Catholic Church does not recognise the validity of Anglican ordinations, Leonard&#x27;s ordination was conditional due to there being &quot;prudent doubt&quot; about his previous ordination in the Church of England, because at Leonard&#x27;s own consecration in 1964 a bishop of an Old Catholic church of the Union of Utrecht (whose own ordination as a bishop was recognised as valid by the Roman Catholic Church) was among the bishops who consecrated him. This eased his reception into the Roman Catholic Church, although his claim that he was legitimately a bishop and his request for a personal prelature were rejected.

Leonard stated that he was not first ordained a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church and that Pope John Paul II&#x27;s personal instruction was that he should be ordained immediately to the priesthood &quot;sub conditione&quot;. He was later appointed a papal chaplain with the title Monsignor and then a prelate of honour by the Pope on 3 August 2000.

==Family==
Leonard was the brother-in-law to the academic Michael Swann (Lord Swann of Coln St Denys) and Hugh Swann, cabinet maker to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, having married their sister, Priscilla Swann, in 1943. He and his wife had two sons.

==National Portrait Gallery==

<text>Schmutzdecke (German, &quot;dirt cover&quot; or dirty skin, sometimes wrongly spelled schmutzedecke) is a hypogeal biological layer formed on the surface of a slow sand filter and a form of periphyton. The schmutzdecke is the layer that provides the effective purification in potable water treatment, the underlying sand providing the support medium for this biological treatment layer.

The composition of any particular schmutzdecke varies, but will typically consist of a gelatinous biofilm matrix of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, rotifera and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As a schmutzdecke ages, more algae tend to develop, and larger aquatic organisms may be present including some bryozoa, snails and annelid worms.

<doc id="1193842" wikidata="Q4118951" url="?curid=1193842" title="1990 oil price shock">
<text>The 1990 oil price shock occurred in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s second invasion of a fellow OPEC member. Lasting only nine months, the price spike was less extreme and of shorter duration than the previous oil crises of 1973–1974 and 1979–1980, but the spike still contributed to the recession of the early 1990s in the United States. The average monthly price of oil rose from $17 per barrel in July to $36 per barrel in October. As the U.S.-led coalition experienced military success against Iraqi forces, concerns about long-term supply shortages eased and prices began to fall.

==Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and ensuing economic effects==
On August 2, 1990, the Republic of Iraq invaded the State of Kuwait, leading to a seven-month occupation of Kuwait and an eventual U.S.-led military intervention. While Iraq officially claimed Kuwait was stealing its oil via slant drilling, its true motives were more complicated and less clear. At the time of the invasion, Iraq owed Kuwait $14 billion of outstanding debt that Kuwait had loaned it during the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. In addition, Iraq felt Kuwait was overproducing oil, lowering prices and hurting Iraqi oil profits in a time of financial stress.

In the buildup to the invasion, Iraq and Kuwait had been producing a combined of oil a day. The potential loss of these supplies, coupled with threats to Saudi Arabian oil production, led to a rise in prices from $21 per barrel at the end of July to $28 per barrel on August 6. On the heels of the invasion, prices rose to a peak of $46 per barrel in mid-October.

The United States&#x27; rapid intervention and subsequent military success helped to mitigate the potential risk to future oil supplies, thereby calming the market and restoring confidence. After only nine months, the spike had subsided, although the Kuwaiti oil fires set by retreating Iraqi forces were not completely extinguished until November 1991, and it took years for the two countries&#x27; combined production to regain its former level.

===U.S. financial response===
The U.S. Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary tightening in 1988 targeted the rapid inflation of the 1980s. By raising interest rates and lowering growth expectations, the Fed hoped to slow and eventually reduce inflationary pressures, creating greater price stability. The August 6 invasion was seen as a direct threat to the price stability the Fed sought. In fact, the Council of Economic Advisors published a consensus estimate that a one-year, 50 percent increase in the price of oil could temporarily raise the price level of the economy by one percent and potentially lower real output by the same amount.

Despite the potential for inflation, the U.S. Fed and central banks around the globe decided it would not be necessary to raise interest rates to counteract the rise in oil prices. Rather, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates as if the oil price spike were not occurring. This decision to refrain from action stemmed from confidence in the future success of Desert Storm to protect major oil-producing facilities in the Middle East and a will to maintain the long-term credibility of economy policy that had been built up during the 1980s.

To avoid being accused of inaction in the face of potential economic turbulence, the U.S. revised the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act. Initially, the act prohibited the U.S. from changing budget deficit targets even in the event of a negative shock to the economy. When oil prices rose, revision of this act allowed the U.S. government to adjust its budget for changes in the economy, further mitigating the risk of rising prices. The result was a peak in prices at $46 per barrel in mid-October, followed by a steady decline in prices until 1994.

<doc id="1193844" wikidata="Q15043437" url="?curid=1193844" title="Murrayfield">
<text>Murrayfield is an area to the west of Edinburgh city centre in Scotland. It is to the east of Corstorphine and north of Balgreen, Saughtonhall and Roseburn. The A8 road runs east–west through the south of the area. Murrayfield is often considered to include the smaller neighbouring areas of Ravelston (to the north) and Roseburn (to the south).

==History==
The name comes from the estate of Archibald Murray who built Murrayfield House for himself in 1735 on the south-facing slopes over the area. Archibald Murray bought the land from Nisbet of Dean in 1733; it was previously Nisbet&#x27;s Park. Alexander Murray, Lord Henderland was born here the year after its construction. Much of the Murrayfield area was semi-rural up until the early 19th century. Among mansion houses built then was Belmont House in 1828 by architect William Playfair for Lord Mackenzie and a large villa known as Rock Villa (later Rockshiel) appears on the Ordnance Survey Map of 1855. The OS map from the 1890s suggests this area remained spacious with scattered individual houses and villas throughout the nineteenth-century.

Easter Belmont Road (a private road), is one of Edinburgh&#x27;s &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Rows&quot; and was home to local businessman David Murray. Aside from sports facilities, there is much residential land use and a private hospital, Spire Murrayfield Hospital, part of the Spire Healthcare group. There are also a few shops, businesses and hotels.

== Sports ==
Murrayfield is known for Murrayfield Stadium, home to the Scottish national rugby union team and venue for many sporting events. In the shadow of the stadium is Murrayfield Ice Rink, which currently hosts the Edinburgh Capitals ice hockey team and previously played host to the famous Murrayfield Racers. In the 2006–07 season, Heart of Midlothian played their UEFA Champions League ties at Murrayfield. Murrayfield Stadium has also been the venue for some large concerts.

In addition to the stadium, there are Murrayfield Lawn Tennis Club and Murrayfield golf course which is between Ravelston and Corstorphine Hill. The tennis club was founded in 1904 as The West Edinburgh Tennis and Croquet Club. Murrayfield Golf Club was founded in 1896 and its initial membership was limited to &#x27;300 gentlemen and 200 ladies&#x27;; in 1904 it was laid out on Ravelston Estate west of Murrayfield Road. Murrayfield Golf Club is notable for having been a mixed club from the start with female members having the same rights and privileges as the men.

==Schools==
The well-known independent schools, St. George&#x27;s School for Girls and the Merchant Company of Edinburgh&#x27;s The Mary Erskine School for girls are situated in the Murrayfield area.

The local primary school for most is Roseburn Primary School and Murrayfield is part of the Craigmount High School catchment area. The nearest Roman Catholic schools are Fox Covert R.C. Primary School and St. Augustine&#x27;s High School.

<text>Merrimac Square is located in the center of the town of Merrimac, Massachusetts. It is the commercial, cultural and historical center of the town.

The main events of the town, including the &quot;Merrimac Santa Parade&quot; and Merrimac Old Home Days, are held in the square.

The Square joins East and West Main Streets, as well as Church Street and School Street. There was previously only a concrete island in the center of the roadway, with a flagpole at the center. The two banks, one of them in a building dating back to the 1800s, are located at the entrance to West Main Street. The fire station is located near the entrance to East Main Street.

In mid-2015, the town square was renovated, changing the open roadway of the square into a small rotary, as well as implementing a new water main and sidewalks compliant with the ADA.

<doc id="1193861" wikidata="Q2637699" url="?curid=1193861" title="Wooden spoon (award)">
<text>A wooden spoon is an award that is given to an individual or team that has come last in a competition. Examples range from the academic to sporting and more frivolous events. The term is of British origin and has spread to other English-speaking countries. In most cases it is simply a colloquial term for coming last – there is no actual award given.

== Wooden spoon at the University of Cambridge ==
The wooden spoon was presented originally at the University of Cambridge as a kind of booby prize awarded by the students to the person who achieved the lowest exam marks but still earned a third-class degree (a &quot;junior optime&quot;) in the Mathematical Tripos. The term &quot;wooden spoon&quot; or simply &quot;the spoon&quot; was also applied to the recipient, and the prize became quite notorious:

The spoons themselves, actually made of wood, grew larger, and in latter years measured up to five feet long. By tradition, they were dangled in a teasing way from the upstairs balcony in the Senate House, in front of the recipient as he came before the Vice-Chancellor to receive his degree, at least until 1875 when the practice was specifically banned by the university.

The lowest placed students earning a second-class (&quot;senior optime&quot;) or first-class degree (&quot;wrangler&quot;) were sometimes known as the &quot;silver spoon&quot; and &quot;golden spoon&quot; respectively. In contrast, the highest-scoring male student was named the &quot;senior wrangler&quot;. Students unfortunate enough to place below the wooden spoon, by achieving only an Ordinary degree, were given a variety of names depending on their number. In the 1860s about three-quarters of the roughly 400 candidates did not score enough to be awarded honours, and were known as &quot;poll men&quot;.

The custom dates back at least to the late 18th century, being recorded in 1803, and continued until 1909. From 1910 onwards the results have been given in alphabetical rather than score order, and so it is now impossible to tell who has come last, unless there is only one person in the lowest class.

===Last award===

The last wooden spoon was awarded to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1909 at the graduation ceremony in the university&#x27;s Senate House. The handle is shaped like an oar and inscribed with an epigram in Greek which may be translated as follows:
In Honours Mathematical,
This is the very last of all
The Wooden Spoons which you see here;
O you who see it, shed a tear.
Alternatively:

This wooden object is the last souvenir of the competitive examinations in mathematics. Look upon it, and weep.
The last spoon to be awarded is now in the possession of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, with an earlier version being kept at the Selwyn College Library. From 8 June 2009 to 26 June 2009, St John&#x27;s College held an exhibition of the five surviving wooden spoons in College hands, from St John&#x27;s (the last one, dating from 1909), Selwyn&#x27;s (1906), Emmanuel&#x27;s (1889) and Corpus Christi&#x27;s (1895 and 1907) in its library to mark the centenary of the &quot;awarding&quot; of the last spoon of all. There are five known wooden spoons in private hands.

== In sport ==
===Rugby union ===
In rugby union&#x27;s Six Nations Championship, the wooden spoon is a metaphorical award won by the team finishing in last place. In addition, if a team loses all its matches it is also said to have been &quot;whitewashed&quot;. In 1892, &quot;Rugby Football&quot;, by Rev. F. Marshall explains, &quot;all three matches being lost, Wales thus earned the “wooden spoon” of International football for this season&quot;. In 1894, the &quot;South Wales Daily Post&quot; remarked that within the Home Nations Championships the Ireland-Wales match has been to decide which team should be recipient of the ignominious Wooden Spoon.

=== Australian and New Zealand sports ===

The term is commonly used in Australian and New Zealand sporting competitions, most notably in the major Australian rules, soccer, rugby league and rugby union leagues (such as the AFL, the A-League, NRL, Super Rugby and ITM Cup) and refers to the club positioned last on the league table at the end of the season.

==== VFL/AFL wooden spoons ====
==== National Rugby League ====
==== Big Bash League (cricket) ====
==== Suncorp Super Netball ====
In the 2017 and 2018 Suncorp Super Netball seasons, the Adelaide Thunderbirds claimed the wooden spoon. In the latter year, they lost all fourteen of their regular season matches, resulting in Dan Ryan being sacked as the club&#x27;s coach.

The Queensland Firebirds, Collingwood Magpies and Melbourne Vixens have won the past three wooden spoons, with the Vixens the most recent recipient of the award.

===Major League Soccer===
In Canada and the United States&#x27; men&#x27;s Major League Soccer, the last place team in the overall standings is generally considered as the &quot;wooden spoon champion&quot;. However, unlike other Wooden Spoon awards, there is a physical &quot;trophy&quot; for the award. Before the start of the 2016 MLS season, the Independent Supporters Council decided to create an actual official &quot;trophy&quot; for the lowest place team in the league, as a complement to the Supporters&#x27; Shield which the ISC also manages. The trophy is passed to the &quot;winning&quot; team at the annual ISC general meeting, and the holders of the Spoon must possess the spoon for the entire following season. At the end of the year, every group awarded the Wooden Spoon are allowed to do what they will with the trophy, including refusing to display it.

The Chicago Fire were the &quot;winner&quot; of the inaugural 2015 wooden spoon trophy and their supporters had the responsibility of creating the first spoon. The award was christened the Andrew Hauptman Memorial Wooden Spoon by Chicago Fire supporters as a protest against the team&#x27;s then-owner, Andrew Hauptman (2007–2019). The spoon was renamed in 2017 to the Anthony Precourt Memorial Wooden Spoon, after the then-owner of the Columbus Crew, who at the time was attempting to move the franchise to Austin.

The San Jose Earthquakes hold the league record for most spoon &quot;wins&quot; overall (1997, 2000, 2008, 2018 and 2024). In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the wooden spoon was not officially awarded following the 2020 MLS season (which would have been won by FC Cincinnati), as the ISC board &quot;felt it was inappropriate to offer such a distinction for shortened and geographically-limited seasons&quot;. The current spoon holders are the San Jose Earthquakes (2024).

=== Canadian Premier League ===
The Canadian Premier League has an unofficial trophy, awarded to the team that finishes with the fewest points at the end of the regular season. The most recent recipient are Valour FC as of the 2023 season.

=== Oxford and Cambridge rowing ===
In the Cambridge and Oxford bumps races, a crew who get bumped each day (thus moving down four places) are awarded spoons. This is probably related to the use of wooden spoons as a booby prize in the University of Cambridge Mathematical Tripos.

===Tennis===
A wooden spoon, also known as the &quot;anti-slam&quot;, is sometimes spoken about in tennis. It is described as the worst possible outcome in a tournament, won by the player who is defeated in the first round by a player who is defeated in the second round, who is defeated in the third round and so forth, until the final of the tournament.

Some notable Grand Slam &quot;wooden spooners&quot; include, among others, John McEnroe (1978 Wimbledon Championships), Katerina Maleeva (1985 US Open), Nathalie Tauziat (1989 French Open), Manuela Maleeva-Fragnière (1990 Wimbledon Championships), Richard Krajicek (1994 Wimbledon Championships), Goran Ivanišević (1995 Australian Open), Mary Pierce (2002 Australian Open), Marat Safin (2004 US Open), Caroline Wozniacki (2007 French Open), Ana Ivanovic (2010 Wimbledon Championships), Karolína Plíšková (2015 US Open), Rafael Nadal (2016 Australian Open), Jelena Janković (2016 French Open), Naomi Osaka (2017 French Open), Stefanos Tsitsipas (2018 Australian Open), and Jeļena Ostapenko (2018 French Open - she was the defending champion, having won in 2017). Recently, Félix Auger-Aliassime achieved it at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, and Simona Halep at the 2022 US Open (tennis) and again at the 2024 Miami Open.

Greg Rusedski (1994 and 1995 US Open, 2006 Wimbledon Championships), Nicolás Lapentti (1996 French Open, 1997 and 2009 Wimbledon Championships) and Julien Benneteau (2014 and 2016 US Open, 2016 French Open) have claimed three wooden spoons throughout their career.

<doc id="1193877" wikidata="Q284297" url="?curid=1193877" title="Xterm">
<text>xterm is the standard terminal emulator for the X Window System. It allows users to run programs which require a command-line interface.

If no particular program is specified, xterm runs the user&#x27;s shell. An X display can show one or more user&#x27;s xterm windows output at the same time. Each xterm window is a separate process, but all share the same keyboard, taking turns as each xterm process acquires &quot;focus&quot;. Normally focus switches between X applications as the user moves the pointer (e.g., a mouse cursor) about the screen, but xterm provides options to &quot;grab focus&quot; (the &quot;Secure Keyboard&quot; feature) as well as accept input events sent without using the keyboard (the &quot;Allow SendEvents&quot; feature). Those options have limitations, as discussed in the xterm manual.

XTerm originated prior to the X Window System. It was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator for the VAXStation 100 (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, a student of Jim Gettys, in the summer of 1984, when work on X started. It rapidly became clear that it would be more useful as part of X than as a standalone program, so it was retargeted to X. As Gettys tells the story, &quot;part of why xterm&#x27;s internals are so horrifying is that it was originally intended that a single process be able to drive multiple VS100 displays.&quot;

After many years as part of the X reference implementation, around 1996 the main line of development then shifted to XFree86 (which itself forked from X11R6.3), and it is now maintained by Thomas Dickey.

Many xterm variants are also available, such as hanterm, a variant tailored to Korean speakers, and kterm, which is designed for Japanese speakers. Most terminal emulators for X started as variations on xterm.

==Features==

===Terminal emulation===
Early versions emulated the VT102 and Tektronix 4014. 

Later versions added control sequences for DEC and other terminals such as:
* VT220: Added in patch 24. Later, in 1998, xterm added support for VT220 features, such as extending its support of ISO-2022 &quot;shift functions&quot; to provide the National Replacement Character Set feature.
* VT320: Added in patch 24.
* VT420: DECSTR (soft terminal reset) was added in patch 34. In 2012, xterm&#x27;s default emulation was changed to VT420 to allow tmux to assume the corresponding left/right margin support.
* VT520: Although not officially emulated, parts of VT520 features were implemented. Controls DECSMBV and DECSWBV for setting the margin- and warning-bell volume were added in patch 254.

===Customization===
As with most X applications, xterm can be customized via global X resources files (e.g. /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm), per-user resource files (e.g. ~/XTerm, ~/.Xresources), or command-line arguments. Most of the command-line options correspond to resource settings, as noted in the manual page.

While the name of the program is &quot;xterm&quot;, the X resource class is &quot;XTerm&quot;. The uxterm script overrides this, using the &quot;UXTerm&quot; resource class.

XTerm normally does not have a menu bar. To access xterm&#x27;s three menus, users hold the control key and press the left, middle, or right mouse button. Support for a &quot;toolbar&quot; can be compiled-in, which invokes the same menus.

===Protocols===
Supported terminal control functions include:
* ANSI X3.64
* Sixel
* Digital Equipment Corporation VT family:
** VT52
** VT102
** VT220
** VT420
* Tektronix family:
** Tektronix 4014

In addition to protocols used in commercially available terminal machines, xterm added a few protocols that have been adopted by other terminal emulators, such as:
* Mouse tracking: Support for buttons 4 and 5 was added in patch 120.
* 16-color terminal protocol: Added in patch 39.
* 256 colors terminal protocol: Added in patch 111.
* 88-color terminal protocol: Added in patch 115.
* Custom color palette: Ability to specifying the RGB values for palette entries was added in patch 111.
=== Fonts ===
Initially Xterm supported only Portable Compiled Format (PCF) bitmap font until 2000 when Xft library was introduced to support modern stroke-based fonts like TrueType.

<doc id="1193895" wikidata="Q6789529" url="?curid=1193895" title="Matt Williams (rugby union coach)">
<text>Matt Williams (born 1960) is an Australian former rugby union coach. Since 2015 he has worked as a pundit for Virgin Media Television and has written for The Irish Times since 2011.

==Playing career==
Williams played from 1978 to 1992 with both Eastwood and Western Suburbs Rugby Clubs in Sydney and with Swansea RFC in Wales.

==Coaching==

Williams started by coaching Western Suburbs U20s in Sydney, Australia in 1992. A year later he became head coach of his former club Eastwood in Sydney in 1993. Later that year he was appointed fitness and skills coach for the Emerging Wallabies&#x27; tour of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.

In 1995 his coaching stints included New South Wales A, New South Wales Sevens, and as assistant coach for an Australian XV against England A. He was also a coaching assistant at the Wallaby World Cup camps.

In addition to national coaching duties, Williams also coached the Balmain Tigers 7s team in the Coca-Cola World Sevens in Sydney, winning the Cup.

In 1996 he became manager and assistant coach for the NSW Waratahs Super Rugby campaign. For the next three years he was Head Coach for the NSW Waratahs in Super Rugby.

In the autumn of 1999, he acted as backs coach in Leinster Rugby&#x27;s European Cup campaign, becoming the province&#x27;s head coach in 2000. Williams also undertook the role of defensive coach for the Irish national team in 2001. Leinster won the inaugural Celtic League Final and were knocked out at the semi-final of the European Cup.

Williams also was appointed Head Coach of Ireland &quot;A&quot; (not to be confused with the actual Irish team) in 2002-03 and won the Six Nations title with the &quot;A&quot; team.

===Scotland===
In 2003, he was appointed as the head coach of Scotland but was axed in 2005 having only secured 3 wins out of 17 test matches.

After his Scotland tenure, Williams returned to Australia and became head coach of West Harbour rugby club in Sydney from 2006 to 2007 before returning to Ireland to take over Ulster team mid-season, after they had sacked former coach Mark McCall.

Williams resigned from the post of Head Coach at Ulster Rugby in May 2009.

In 2011 he was head coach of Club Narbonne Méditerranée in France. He resigned in July 2012.

He then returned to Australia and in 2013 he set up the rugby programme at the Knox Sports Academy in Sydney.

Williams had a brief three-month stint, advising the Timișoara Saracensclub in Romania, and he left in November 2017.

<doc id="1193896" wikidata="Q4185" url="?curid=1193896" title="Lingen, Germany">
<text>Lingen (), officially Lingen (Ems), is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany. In 2024, its population was 59,896 with 2,262 people who had registered the city as their secondary residence. Lingen, specifically &quot;Lingen (Ems)&quot; is located on the river Ems in the southern part of the Emsland District, which borders North Rhine-Westphalia in the south and the Netherlands in the west.

==History==

Lingen was first mentioned in the Middle Ages (975 AD). From 804 to 1180 the region was part of the Duchy of Saxony inside the Carolingian Empire, and then remained part of the german-speaking Holy Roman Empire until 1806. A initially independent county of Lingen (&quot;Grafschaft Lingen&quot;) was erected in 1388 and remained until 1713, when Prussia took over. In detail though, the county and city in the 17th and 18th were repeatedly conquered by Dutch and Spanish troops: initially Catholic, from 1541 to 1547 the citizens were forced to become Lutheran, then the troops of Catholic Charles V conquered the county and city and in 1550 gave it to his sister Mary, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. From 1555 to 1597 Lingen was the easternmost point of the Spanish Empire of Philip II and became part of the Eighty Years&#x27; War. From 1597 to 1605 Lingen was conquered by the Calvinist and Dutch Union of Utrecht, then retaken by the Catholic Spanish troops and from 1632 to 1672 again was part of the Calvinist Union of Utrecht. For two years the Prince-Bishopric of Münster had the city, which then from 1674 to 1713 was part of the Calvinist Union of Utrecht again, when Frederick I of Prussia inherited the county. From 1807 to 1813 the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte occupied the region, and from 1810 to 1813 Lingen was part of France. In 1814 it again was part of Prussia, and in 1815 became part of the newly founded kingdom of Hanover. As result of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 the kingdom of Hanover and also Lingen were annexed by the kingdom of Prussia, and in 1871 became part of the German Empire.

==Economy and education==
Lingen is known for its offshore- and nuclear industry (Emsland Nuclear Power Plant). The University of Applied Sciences Osnabrueck has set up a branch campus, located in the centre of Lingen, with the three Institutes for Management and Engineering, Communications Management and Teaching of Theatre. In 2000 the institutes in Lingen merged into the Faculty of Society and Technology.

==Climate==
Lingen has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;).

<doc id="1193903" wikidata="Q1260741" url="?curid=1193903" title="Uncontrolled decompression">
<text>An uncontrolled decompression is an undesired drop in the pressure of a sealed system, such as a pressurised aircraft cabin or hyperbaric chamber, that typically results from human error, structural failure, or impact, causing the pressurised vessel to vent into its surroundings or fail to pressurize at all.

Such decompression may be classed as &quot;explosive, rapid&quot;, or &quot;slow&quot;:
* Explosive decompression (ED) is violent and too fast for air to escape safely from the lungs and other air-filled cavities in the body such as the sinuses and eustachian tubes, typically resulting in severe to fatal barotrauma.
* Rapid decompression may be slow enough to allow cavities to vent but may still cause serious barotrauma or discomfort.
* Slow or gradual decompression occurs so slowly that it may not be sensed before hypoxia sets in.

==Description==
The term &quot;uncontrolled decompression&quot; here refers to the unplanned depressurisation of vessels that are occupied by people; for example, a pressurised aircraft cabin at high altitude, a spacecraft, or a hyperbaric chamber. For the catastrophic failure of other pressure vessels used to contain gas, liquids, or reactants under pressure, the term explosion is more commonly used, or other specialised terms such as BLEVE may apply to particular situations.

Decompression can occur due to structural failure of the pressure vessel, or failure of the compression system itself. The speed and violence of the decompression is affected by the size of the pressure vessel, the differential pressure between the inside and outside of the vessel, and the size of the leak hole.

The US Federal Aviation Administration recognizes three distinct types of decompression events in aircraft: explosive, rapid, and gradual decompression.

===Explosive decompression===

Explosive decompression occurs typically in less than 0.1 to 0.5 seconds, a change in cabin pressure faster than the lungs can decompress. Normally, the time required to release air from the lungs without restrictions, such as masks, is 0.2 seconds. The risk of lung trauma is very high, as is the danger from any unsecured objects that can become projectiles because of the explosive force, which may be likened to a bomb detonation.

Immediately after an explosive decompression, a heavy fog may fill the aircraft cabin as the air cools, raising the relative humidity and causing sudden condensation. Military pilots with oxygen masks must pressure-breathe, whereby the lungs fill with air when relaxed, and effort has to be exerted to expel the air again.

===Rapid decompression===
Rapid decompression typically takes more than 0.1 to 0.5 seconds, allowing the lungs to decompress more quickly than the cabin. The risk of lung damage is still present, but significantly reduced compared with explosive decompression.

===Gradual decompression===

Slow, or gradual, decompression occurs slowly enough to go unnoticed and might only be detected by instruments. This type of decompression may also come about from a failure to pressurize the cabin as an aircraft climbs to altitude. An example of this is the 2005 Helios Airways Flight 522 crash, in which the maintenance service left the pressurization system in manual mode and the pilots did not check the pressurization system. As a result, they suffered a loss of consciousness (as well as most of the passengers and crew) due to hypoxia (lack of oxygen). The plane continued to fly due to the autopilot system and eventually crashed due to fuel exhaustion after leaving its flight path.

==Decompression injuries==

The following physical injuries may be associated with decompression incidents:

*Hypoxia is the most serious risk associated with decompression, especially as it may go undetected or incapacitate the aircrew.
*Barotrauma: an inability to equalize pressure in internal air spaces such as the middle ear or gastrointestinal tract, or more serious injury such as a burst lung.
*Decompression sickness.
*Altitude sickness.
*Frostbite or hypothermia from exposure to freezing cold air at high altitude.
* Physical trauma caused by the violence of explosive decompression, which can turn people and loose objects into projectiles.
At least two confirmed cases have been documented of a person being blown through an airplane passenger window. The first occurred in 1973 when debris from an engine failure struck a window roughly midway in the fuselage. Despite efforts to pull the passenger back into the airplane, the occupant was forced entirely through the cabin window. The passenger&#x27;s skeletal remains were eventually found by a construction crew, and were positively identified two years later. The second incident occurred on April 17, 2018, when a woman on Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 was partially blown through an airplane passenger window that had broken from a similar engine failure. Although the other passengers were able to pull her back inside, she later died from her injuries. In both incidents, the plane landed safely with the sole fatality being the person seated next to the window involved.

According to NASA scientist Geoffrey A. Landis, the effect depends on the size of the hole, which can be expanded by debris that is blown through it; &quot;it would take about 100 seconds for pressure to equalise through a roughly hole in the fuselage of a Boeing 747.&quot; Anyone blocking the hole would have half a ton of force pushing them towards it, but this force reduces rapidly with distance from the hole.

==Implications for aircraft design==
Modern aircraft are specifically designed with longitudinal and circumferential reinforcing ribs in order to prevent localised damage from tearing the whole fuselage open during a decompression incident. However, decompression events have nevertheless proved fatal for aircraft in other ways. In 1974, explosive decompression onboard Turkish Airlines Flight 981 caused the floor to collapse, severing vital flight control cables in the process. The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive the following year requiring manufacturers of wide-body aircraft to strengthen floors so that they could withstand the effects of in-flight decompression caused by an opening of up to in the lower deck cargo compartment. Manufacturers were able to comply with the Directive either by strengthening the floors and/or installing relief vents called &quot;dado panels&quot; between the passenger cabin and the cargo compartment.

Cabin doors are designed to prevent losing cabin pressure through them by making it nearly impossible to open them in flight, whether accidentally or intentionally. The plug door design ensures that when the pressure inside the cabin exceeds the pressure outside, the doors are forced shut and will not open until the pressure is equalized. Cabin doors, including the emergency exits, but not all cargo doors, open inwards, or must first be pulled inwards and then rotated before they can be pushed out through the door frame because at least one dimension of the door is larger than the door frame. Pressurization prevented the doors of Saudia Flight 163 from being opened on the ground after the aircraft made a successful emergency landing, resulting in the deaths of all 287passengers and 14crew members from fire and smoke.

Prior to 1996, approximately 6,000large commercial transport airplanes were type certified to fly up to , without being required to meet special conditions related to flight at high altitude. In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25–87, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin-pressure specifications, for new designs of aircraft types. For aircraft certified to operate above 25,000 feet (FL 250; 7,600 m), it &quot;must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system.&quot; In the event of a decompression which results from &quot;any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable,&quot; the aircraft must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding for more than 2minutes, nor exceeding an altitude of at any time. In practice, that new FAR amendment imposes an operational ceiling of 40,000feet on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft.

In 2004, Airbus successfully petitioned the FAA to allow cabin pressure of the A380 to reach in the event of a decompression incident and to exceed for one minute. This special exemption allows the A380 to operate at a higher altitude than other newly designed civilian aircraft, which have not yet been granted a similar exemption.

==International standards==
The Depressurization Exposure Integral (DEI) is a quantitative model that is used by the FAA to enforce compliance with decompression-related design directives. The model relies on the fact that the pressure that the subject is exposed to and the duration of that exposure are the two most important variables at play in a decompression event.

Other national and international standards for explosive decompression testing include:
*MIL-STD-810, 202
*RTCA/DO-160
*NORSOK M710
*API 17K and 17J
*NACE TM0192 and TM0297
*TOTALELFFINA SP TCS 142 Appendix H

==Notable decompression accidents and incidents==
Decompression incidents are not uncommon on military and civilian aircraft, with approximately 40–50 rapid decompression events occurring worldwide annually. However, in most cases the problem is manageable, injuries or structural damage rare and the incident not considered notable. One notable, recent case was Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 in 2018, where an uncontained engine failure ruptured a window, causing a passenger to be partially blown out.

Decompression incidents do not occur solely in aircraft; the Byford Dolphin accident is an example of violent explosive decompression of a saturation diving system on an oil rig. A decompression event is often the result of a failure caused by another problem (such as an explosion or mid-air collision), but the decompression event may worsen the initial issue.

==Myths==
===A bullet through a window may cause explosive decompression===
In 2004, the TV show &quot;MythBusters&quot; examined whether explosive decompression occurs when a bullet is fired through the fuselage of an airplane informally by way of several tests using a decommissioned pressurised DC-9. A single shot through the side or the window did not have any effect – it took actual explosives to cause explosive decompression – suggesting that the fuselage is designed to prevent people from being blown out. Professional pilot David Lombardo states that a bullet hole would have no perceived effect on cabin pressure as the hole would be smaller than the opening of the aircraft&#x27;s outflow valve.

NASA scientist Geoffrey A. Landis points out though that the impact depends on the size of the hole, which can be expanded by debris that is blown through it. Landis went on to say that &quot;it would take about 100 seconds for pressure to equalise through a roughly hole in the fuselage of a Boeing 747.&quot; He then stated that anyone sitting next to the hole would have about half a ton of force pulling them towards it. At least two confirmed cases have been documented of a person being blown through an airplane passenger window. The first occurred in 1973 when debris from an engine failure struck a window roughly midway in the fuselage. Despite efforts to pull the passenger back into the airplane, the occupant was forced entirely through the cabin window. The passenger&#x27;s skeletal remains were eventually found by a construction crew, and were positively identified two years later. The second incident occurred on April 17, 2018, when a woman on Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 was partially blown through an airplane passenger window that had broken from a similar engine failure. Although the other passengers were able to pull her back inside, she later died from her injuries. In both incidents, the plane landed safely with the sole fatality being the person seated next to the window involved. Fictional accounts of this include a scene in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, when James Bond kills the eponymous villain by blowing him out a passenger window and &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, when an errant gunshot shatters a window on a cargo plane and rapidly expands, causing multiple enemy officials, henchmen and the main villain to be sucked out to their deaths.

===Exposure to a vacuum causes the body to explode===
This persistent myth is based on a failure to distinguish between two types of decompression and their exaggerated portrayal in some fictional works. The first type of decompression deals with changing from normal atmospheric pressure (one atmosphere) to a vacuum (zero atmosphere) which is usually centered around space exploration. The second type of decompression changes from exceptionally high pressure (many atmospheres) to normal atmospheric pressure (one atmosphere) as may occur in deep-sea diving.

The first type is more common as pressure reduction from normal atmospheric pressure to a vacuum can be found in both space exploration and high-altitude aviation. Research and experience have shown that while exposure to a vacuum causes swelling, human skin is tough enough to withstand the drop of one atmosphere. The most serious risk from vacuum exposure is hypoxia, in which the body is starved of oxygen, leading to unconsciousness within a few seconds. Rapid uncontrolled decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold their breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs. Eardrums and sinuses may also be ruptured by rapid decompression, and soft tissues may be affected by bruises seeping blood. If the victim somehow survived, the stress and shock would accelerate oxygen consumption, leading to hypoxia at a rapid rate. At the extremely low pressures encountered at altitudes above about , the boiling point of water becomes less than normal body temperature. This measure of altitude is known as the Armstrong limit, which is the practical limit to survivable altitude without pressurization. Fictional accounts of bodies exploding due to exposure from a vacuum include, among others, several incidents in the movie &quot;Outland&quot;, while in the movie &quot;Total Recall&quot;, characters appear to suffer effects of ebullism and blood boiling when exposed to the atmosphere of Mars.

The second type is rare since it involves a pressure drop over several atmospheres, which would require the person to have been placed in a pressure vessel. The only likely situation in which this might occur is during decompression after deep-sea diving. A pressure drop as small as 100 Torr (13 kPa), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if it occurs suddenly. One such incident occurred in 1983 in the North Sea, where violent explosive decompression from nine atmospheres to one caused four divers to die instantly from massive and lethal barotrauma. Dramatized fictional accounts of this include a scene from the film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, when a character&#x27;s head explodes after his hyperbaric chamber is rapidly depressurized, and another in the film &quot;DeepStar Six&quot;, wherein rapid depressurization causes a character to hemorrhage profusely before exploding in a similar fashion.

<text>Sher Shah Awan (14 February 1917 – 20 January 1945) was a British Indian Army soldier who received the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Sher Shah was an Awan Muslim and the son of Barkhurdar and his wife Makda Bibi; and husband of Mehr Bhari, from the village of Chakrala, about 30 km east from Mianwali, Punjab region that is now part of Pakistan. He was 27 years old and a lance naik in the 7th Battalion of the 16th Punjab Regiment in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 19/20 January 1945 at Kyeyebyin, Kaladan, Burma (now Myanmar), Lance Naik Sher Shah was commanding a left forward section of his platoon when it was attacked by overwhelming numbers of Japanese. He broke up two attacks by crawling right in among the enemy and shooting at point-blank range. On the second occasion he was hit and his leg shattered, but he maintained that his injury was only slight and when the third attack came, he again crawled forward engaging the enemy until he was shot through the head and killed.

Sher Shah&#x27;s Battalion 7/16 Punjab Regiment, affectionately known as &quot;Saat Solah Punjab&quot;, is now a part of the Pakistan Army, proudly known as the &quot;Sher Shah Battalion&quot;.

<text>Leamore is a suburb of Bloxwich and Walsall in Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, West Midlands county, England. It is a mix of private and council housing built since the late 19th century. The most significant homes in the area are several multi-storey blocks of council flats, which were built in the 1960s.

== History ==
A council housing development took place around the centre of Leamore in the 1920s, and also included the opening of Somerfield Road, which gave Green Lane a direct link to Bloxwich town centre, and now forms part of the A34. A 280-flat multi-storey estate was developed in the early 1960s to replace an area previously occupied by slums; it was completed in 1964.

== Estates ==
The largest single housing development in Leamore is the Beechdale housing estate which was built by Walsall Council in the 1950s to rehouse people from the town centre slum clearances. Noddy Holder, the lead singer of Slade, grew up in Beechdale. Ball House and Leadbetter House tower blocks, situated in the north of Leamore and built during the 1960s, were demolished in late 2007 after some 40 years of dominating the local skyline.

== Transportation ==
Bloxwich Road is one of two routes running parallel through Leamore between Walsall and Bloxwich, with the other being Green Lane.

<text>Rear Admiral Robert St Vincent Sherbrooke, (8 January 1901 – 13 June 1972) was a senior officer in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Oxton, Nottinghamshire, Sherbrooke attended the Royal Naval Colleges of Osborne and Dartmouth and joined the Royal Navy in 1917 as a midshipman aboard . He was promoted to commander in 1935 and served aboard the aircraft carrier . His wartime commands were all destroyers.

==Victoria Cross==
Sherbrooke was 41 years old and a captain in the Royal Navy during the Second World War when the following deed took place during the Battle of the Barents Sea for which he was awarded the VC.

Sherbrooke&#x27;s actions – and the German ships&#x27; failure to neutralize the convoy despite its superior force – were pivotal in Hitler&#x27;s order to end the use of surface fleet of the Kriegsmarine at the beginning of 1943.

==Later life==
From July 1945 to mid-1946, Sherbrooke was commanding officer of the cruiser . He later achieved the rank of rear admiral.

He was appointed High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1958–59. His daughter is Dione Digby, Lady Digby.

He died in his home town of Oxton, aged 71.

<text>Jacqueline Susan McKenzie (born 24 October 1967) is an Australian film and stage actress.

==Early life==
Born in Sydney, New South Wales, McKenzie attended Wenona School in North Sydney until 1983 then moved to Pymble Ladies&#x27; College, where she graduated in 1985 with her Higher School Certificate. Known at school for her fine singing voice, McKenzie was cast as Nancy in &quot;Oliver!&quot; then in &quot;Godspell&quot; (both a co-production with Shore School) and later in &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (a co-production with Knox Grammar School), sharing the stage with Hugh Jackman, who was a student at Knox at the time.

==Career==

=== Early years ===
McKenzie studied for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of New South Wales. While at university, she began modelling. Represented by Cameron&#x27;s Management, she worked in both print and television media. She also took regular singing lessons with Australian vocal coach Bob Tasman-Smith. In 1987, McKenzie was cast as the lead in the pilot of television series &quot;All The Way&quot; alongside Ben Mendelsohn, Robert Mammone, Rowena Wallace and Martin Sacks. During this time, she came to the attention of casting agent Liz Mullinar, who had cast Judy Davis in &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; and Nicole Kidman in &quot;Dead Calm&quot;. Following advice from Mullinar, McKenzie auditioned for the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) and was accepted. Opting out of both her arts degree and &quot;All The Way&quot;, McKenzie attended NIDA in 1988. She graduated in December 1990.

===1991 to 1995===
In 1991, McKenzie was awarded &quot;Best Newcomer Award&quot; from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle, which recognised her chameleon-like ability and her consistently high-calibre work in theatre productions &quot;Child Dancing&quot; (as Julie-Ann), &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (as Kaja), &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (as Viola) and &quot;Rebecca&quot; (as Mrs de Winter). During rehearsals for &quot;Rebecca&quot;, director George Ogilvie allowed McKenzie time off to audition for a new Australian Independent feature film called &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; set to star Russell Crowe. She was subsequently cast in the film and went on to win Best Actress award at the Film Critics Circle of Australia. Russell would later say &quot;Jacqui&#x27;s range as an actor disappears over the horizon. And I&#x27;m not sure it can actually be defined. When I first saw her, in the play &quot;Rebecca&quot;, I saw an actor whom I thought was blowing me on the skin from the inside. She is an actor who is both delicate and magical.&quot; In her &quot;nothing short of stunning&quot; film debut in &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;, McKenzie was described as &quot;especially shining in her courage, truth and skill.&quot; The role garnered her attention overseas, where she won Best Actress at the 1992 Stockholm International Film Festival for her &quot;stark and non-sentimental portrayal of a young woman whose life has turned into a desperate chase for all she has lost: love, serenity, identity. Her character plays an essential part in creating the inexorable force and impact of the film.&quot; Over the next couple of years, she came to be regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s most promising young actresses of stage and screen, showcasing a &quot;phenomenal emotional range&quot;.

In 1994, McKenzie starred alongside David Wenham, Geoffrey Rush and Richard Roxburgh in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, directed by Neil Armfield, for Belvoir St Theatre, Sydney. This sellout production was a critical, award-winning success with McKenzie&#x27;s performance &quot;so exquisitely pitched it could have shattered glass&quot;. &quot;Jacqueline McKenzie&#x27;s fragile Ophelia, dressed in cottontails and a tail-coat, turning the stage into a mind-state of shattered glass. Her presence awesomely palpable because of its sheer intangibility.&quot; The production went on to tour to Melbourne but McKenzie was unable to continue due to other work commitments. (Cate Blanchett took over the role of Ophelia for the tour).

McKenzie&#x27;s performance in &quot;Hamlet&quot; was followed by her role as Joan of Arc in Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, directed by Gale Edwards for the Sydney Theatre Company at the Sydney Opera House. This was the first time Saint Joan had been staged in Australia since the Zoe Caldwell production in 1962. Regarded as one of &quot;the most revealing tests of an actress&quot;, and as &quot;the female Hamlet&quot;, Edwards&#x27; production was both a critical and box office sensation with McKenzie&#x27;s performance unanimously acclaimed: &quot;This play stands or falls on the performance of St Joan and McKenzie is simply superb.&quot; &quot;From the moment she enters, she sets the stage ablaze. McKenzie is a Joan to make the theatrical heavens rejoice... McKenzie offers us Joan in all her innocence, ignorance, joyful goodness that seems to light her from within and, almost until the end, a youthful sense of fun. Her slight stature can seem waif thin, piteously vulnerable; but raging into battle she&#x27;s tough and sturdy, a young woman of intense and convincing action. Always in focus, like an unwavering flame, is McKenzie&#x27;s Joan the Maid&quot; and &quot;Here is a Joan with such fortitude and faith that seems hardly possible to exist within such a delicate frame. McKenzie&#x27;s waif-like image conceals remarkable strength, and an almost inexhaustible supply of emotion. It is a Joan to inspire the tamest among us to stand up as individuals, and listen to the voices inside of us. Shaw himself would have been reluctantly impressed.&quot;

Described by head of NIDA, John Clarke, as &quot;A chameleon&quot; &quot;one of the most talented actresses we have produced... she&#x27;s an absolute dynamo, a powerhouse,&quot; McKenzie had fast earned a reputation as one of the most versatile actresses of her generation, taking on varied and often difficult roles. Equally adept in drama or comedy, she was described as the &quot;Judy Davis of her generation (or funnily enough, the green eyed American actor Meg Ryan)&quot; In 1992, Ben Elton cast her as the lead role of &quot;Rachel&quot;, the feisty environmentalist, in the television adaptation of his hit novel &quot;Stark&quot;. The mini-series was a BBC/ABC comedy, was directed by Nadia Tass and co-starred Ben Elton and Colin Friels. McKenzie received an Australian Film Institute Award nomination for Best Actress in a Miniseries for the role. The same year (1993), she scored a Best Actress in a Feature Film nomination for her comedic turn in the indie comedy, &quot;This Won&#x27;t Hurt a Bit&quot;, playing Vanessa Presscott, a nerdy English ingénue with a speech impediment. In 1994, McKenzie reunited with director George Ogilvie (who had directed her in &quot;Rebecca&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;) to play the lead role of Dancy Smith in the adaptation of Kylie Tennant&#x27;s famous depression-era drama &quot;The Battlers&quot;. The mini-series co-starred Gary Sweet and played on the Seven Network. McKenzie was nominated again for Best Actress in a TV Drama at the Australian Film Institute 1994 awards. That same year, McKenzie was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress in the feature film &quot;Traps&quot;, directed by Pauline Chan. Playing the French girl living in Colonial Vietnam, McKenzie got to showcase her versatility by speaking in both French and Vietnamese for the role.

In 1995, McKenzie made Australian Film Institute history by winning the Beyond Best Actress in a Leading Role for &quot;Angel Baby&quot; and the Beyond Best Actress Award in a TV Drama for &quot;Halifax f.p.&quot;: Lies of the Mind. She also won the Silver Logie for Most Outstanding Actress at the Logie Awards for her role in &quot;Halifax f.p.&quot; It was for playing the young lover Kate, opposite John Lynch&#x27;s Harry in the Michael Rymer–helmed drama &quot;Angel Baby&quot;, that McKenzie received international acclaim: The &quot;LA Weekly&quot; reviewed: &quot;McKenzie is a find. Whether using answers on the Wheel of Fortune as a kind of daily horoscope, or cringing in terror as the upright legs of chairs in an empty restaurant seem to whisper at her, she is blazingly equal to the extremes of animal panic and hyperconscious insight that are the north and south of this movie&#x27;s humane compass.&quot; &quot;Angel Baby&quot; also featured actress Deborra-Lee Furness and Colin Friels. In 1996, McKenzie was awarded Australian Star of the Year at the Australian Movie Convention.

=== 1996 to 2003 ===
McKenzie ventured to the US, where she starred in the films &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1999) directed by Renny Harlin with Samuel L. Jackson, Thomas Jane and Michael Rapaport; &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; (2002) with Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd, Ellen Burstyn, Kiersten Warren and James Garner; &quot;Freak Weather&quot;, with Aida Turturro and John Carroll Lynch; &quot;Love from Ground Zero&quot; with Simon Baker and Pruitt Taylor Vince, as well as tele-movie &quot;When Billie Beat Bobby&quot;, starring Holly Hunter and Ron Silver. She starred in the UK independent films &quot;Eisenstein&quot; with Simon McBurney and &quot;Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)&quot; with Stellan Skarsgård, Chris Penn and Paul Bettany.

In 2001, McKenzie was given a United States green card in March 2001 for &quot;Person of Extraordinary Ability&quot;. She made her US theatre debut, starring as Rita in Willy Russell&#x27;s &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, at the Williamstown Theatre Festival directed by Bruce Paltrow and co-starring Edward Herrmann. It was a huge success. &quot;This production had the inexhaustible talents of Jacqueline McKenzie, an utterly charming and irrepressible Australian, whose cockney accent was spot on and characterization was full-cocked. Bursting onto the stage like a fire-engine responding to a five-alarm conflagration, McKenzie was a dynamo with enough energy to fill simultaneous performances of this and Pygmalion (a sure bet for her if the WTF wants to bring her back – and it should). Suffice to say, hers will surely be among the most memorable and reason enough to revive &quot;Rita&quot;.&quot;

She was cast as a lead in the US television pilot for ABC called &quot;MEDS&quot; (later &quot;MDs&quot;), directed by Michael Hoffman and starring John Hannah. She played Dockdaisy in the National Actors Theatre / Complicite co-production of &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot;, by Bertolt Brecht. Directed by Simon McBurney this cast included Al Pacino, Steve Buscemi, Chazz Palminteri, John Goodman, Paul Giamatti, Billy Crudup, Lothaire Bluteau, Linda Emond, Tony Randall and Charles Durning. After this production, McKenzie returned to Australia to star as Catherine in the Pulitzer Prize Winning play &quot;Proof&quot; by David Auburn. Directed by George Ogilvie and starring Barry Otto, Christina Eliason, and Jonny Pasvolsky, this &quot;tour de force from McKenzie&quot; broke all previously held box office records at the Sydney Opera House, Drama Theatre. Mckenzie followed the success of &quot;Proof&quot; by taking the lead role of Jude in the Australian feature film &quot;Peaches&quot;, starring Hugo Weaving and Emma Lung. Directed by Craig Monahan, the role garnered McKenzie a Best Actress Award from the Film Critics Circle of Australia with her performance described as a &quot;revelation&quot;: &quot;never more so than in the scene where she sings &#x27;The Carnival Is Over&#x27; across a pub counter.&quot; From &quot;Peaches&quot;, McKenzie began work with Paul Cox (&quot;Man of Flowers&quot;, &quot;Innocence&quot;) in the feature film &quot;Human Touch&quot; starring as a young chorister estranged from her husband: &quot;McKenzie makes Anna&#x27;s sensual awakening both sensual and real&quot;.

=== 2004 to 2015 ===
In 2004, McKenzie made the switch to prime-time television in a role that would catapult her to international stardom. Cast as the lead female detective Diana Skouris in the US prime-time science fiction television series &quot;The 4400&quot; from Executive Producer Francis Ford Coppola, McKenzie was cast alongside Joel Gretsch (&quot;Taken&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot;) – an onscreen partnership oft likened to Mulder and Scully. Directed by Yves Simoneau with show runner Ira Steven Behr (&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;), &quot;The 4400&quot; was the highest-rated debut on US cable for 2004, earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Best Mini-Series. The show ran on the USA Network for four seasons, ending in 2007. In 2006, McKenzie also starred as Linda Landry in &quot;Umney&#x27;s Last Case&quot; opposite William H. Macy – the third episode of &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot; on TNT. In 2008, McKenzie starred as psychiatrist Veronica Hayden-Jones in the 13-part series &quot;Mental&quot; on the Fox Network, which was filmed at Fox Telecolombia in Bogotá, Colombia. Starring Annabella Sciorra, this was the first American television series to be filmed in Latin America for international markets. McKenzie guest starred in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hawaii 5-0&quot; and the Australian TV series &quot;Rake&quot;. She was cast as Emma Waddell in the Jeremy Sims–directed feature film &quot;Beneath Hill 60&quot; and starred in the 2010 season finale of &quot;&quot; alongside former &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; castmate LL Cool J.

In 2011, Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton, the co-artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company, invited McKenzie to star in their production of Sarah Ruhl&#x27;s &quot;In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)&quot; at the Sydney Opera House, Drama Theatre. Co-starring Mandy McElhinney, this production went on tour to Melbourne Theatre Company, Wollongong, Canberra and Parramatta Riverside Theatre, earning McKenzie a Best Actress nomination at the Green Room Awards for her role as Mrs Givings. This was McKenzie&#x27;s first play since her critically acclaimed turn as Catherine in David Auburn&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning play &quot;Proof&quot;, which sold out at the Sydney Opera House in 2003.

In 2012, she accepted Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton&#x27;s invitation to star in the Australian premiere of the two-hander &quot;Sex With Strangers&quot; by American playwright Laura Eason (&quot;House of Cards&quot;) for the Sydney Theatre Company. This critically acclaimed production co-starred Ryan Corr and was directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse. An award-winning director of many films including &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot;, this was Jocelyn&#x27;s first play.

In 2013, McKenzie starred in the seminal role of Margaret (a.k.a. Maggie) in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; by Tennessee Williams for Belvoir St., directed by Simon Stone, co-starring Ewen Leslie (as Brick) and Marshall Napier (as Big Daddy). A sell-out production with an extension season at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, McKenzie&#x27;s performance, in the role that made Elizabeth Taylor famous, was highly acclaimed: &quot;Jacqueline McKenzie has far more scope in this play than she had in the recent &quot;Sex with Strangers&quot; to display her mesmerizing and neurasthenic talents that are so reminiscent of the early Judy Davis. She squirms, hops, skips and flops through the drama with a manic intensity that is breathtaking to watch from the first scene when she works her way through about a dozen changes of clothing and many pairs of &#x27;hot&#x27; shoes during her long and intense opening monologue&quot; and &quot;McKenzie has been playing some major roles in Sydney recently but here is a great one, finally worthy of her ability, and she rises to it magnificently. Her Maggie is full of feverish energy, and hard-won, hard-edged glamour that a woman who has clawed herself up out of poverty to become the wife of the descendant of a crass but very rich family might be expected to display. She is better than them. She is beautiful, her smile is always bright but brief glimpses of self-doubt betray her origins, and her eyes betray her desperation.&quot; &quot;This is a good production, made great by McKenzie&#x27;s beautiful performance.&quot;

McKenzie returned to the Sydney Opera House in 2014 to play Liza in Andrew Upton&#x27;s adaptation of the Gorky classic &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; for the Sydney Theatre Company. Co-starring with Justine Clarke and Toby Truslove, under the direction of Kip Williams, the production was immensely successful, garnering McKenzie a nomination for Best Actress at the 2014 Sydney Theatre Awards.

In 2014, McKenzie reunited with her &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; co-star, Russell Crowe, to perform in his feature-film-directing debut, &quot;The Water Diviner&quot;, in which he also stars. With a handpicked cast that included Yılmaz Erdoğan, Olga Kurylenko, Ryan Corr, Jai Courtney, Steve Bastoni and Cem Yılmaz, &quot;The Water Diviner&quot; was nominated for eight AACTA awards including Best Supporting Actress in a feature film for McKenzie, who played the role of Russell&#x27;s grieving wife Lizzie. For this performance, McKenzie won Best Supporting Actress at the 2014 Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards.

Films to be released: &quot;Force of Destiny&quot;, written and directed by Paul Cox and starring David Wenham and Shahana Goswami. This will premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival; &quot;Fell&quot;, written and directed by Kasimir Burgess and starring Matt Nable and Daniel Henshall.

In 2015, McKenzie starred alongside Richard Roxburgh and Cate Blanchett in the Sydney Theatre Company production of &quot;The Present&quot;, by Anton Chekhov. Adapted by Andrew Upton, this production was directed by John Crowley. That production moved in 2016/17 to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in Manhattan for the Broadway debut of McKenzie and the rest of the cast. She also starred as Orlando in the Sarah Ruhl play &quot;Orlando&quot;, based on by Virginia Woolf (made famous by the 1992 film directed by Sally Potter and starring Tilda Swinton). Directed by Sarah Goodes, &quot;Orlando&quot; ran at the Sydney Opera House for the Sydney Theatre Company.

McKenzie was nominated for Best Actress in &quot;Orlando&quot; and Best Supporting Actress in &quot;The Present&quot; at the 2015 Sydney Theatre Awards.

=== 2016 to present ===
In 2016, McKenzie reunited with her former &quot;Stark!&quot; co-star Ben Elton for his romantic comedy &quot;Three Summers&quot; filming in Perth. The ensemble also featured Robert Sheean, Magda Szubanski, Michael Caton and Rebecca Breeds.

In August 2016 McKenzie filmed the independent movie &quot;Harmony&quot; in Wollongong and Sydney, Australia.

McKenzie starred as Jane Chandler in Australian feature film &quot;The Gateway&quot; in October 2016. Written by Michael White and directed by John Soto, the sci-fi film also starred Myles Pollard and Ben Mortley. The film follows the journey of a particle physicist who, grieving over the loss of her husband in a car crash, uses a revolutionary machine to bring him back with dire consequences for her family.

In May 2017, SBS announced that McKenzie had been cast in their new four-part drama &quot;Safe Harbour&quot; about a group of Australians who come across a boat of refugees whilst sailing on vacation. The mini-series, produced by Matchbox Pictures, also stars Phoebe Tonkin, Ewen Leslie and Joel Jackson.

In June 2017 McKenzie began filming Luke Sparke&#x27;s movie &quot;Occupation&quot; with Charles Mesure, Temuera Morrison and Dan Ewing about a group of town residents banding together after a devastating ground invasion.

In August 2017, McKenzie started shooting the TV series &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;, a follow-up to the 1992 cult classic movie in which she starred with Russell Crowe. The series, conceived and directed by Geoffrey Wright (creator of the original film) and produced by John Edwards, premiered on Australian streaming platform Stan on New Years Day 2018, breaking all records for original content. The series was aired in the United Kingdom on the BBC later in 2018. For her role in the series McKenzie was awarded a Logie for Most Outstanding Supporting Actress at the Logie Awards of 2018.

At the CinefestOZ awards in August 2017, McKenzie was honoured with the Screen Legend Award, recognising her contribution and excellence in the film industry.

She also reprised her award-winning role &quot;Sharon Sinclair&quot;, from the series &quot;Halifax f.p.,&quot; in the reboot .

In 2021, McKenzie appeared with Annabelle Wallis in James Wan&#x27;s horror film &quot;Malignant&quot;, and starred alongside Jane Seymour in Australia feature film &quot;Ruby&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

==Music==
McKenzie&#x27;s hobbies include composing and recording music. Past collaborators include Vic Levak (Balligomingo) who co-wrote &quot;Shy Baby&quot; and Jim Hayden (Electrasy). When her &quot;4400&quot; co-star Joel Gretsch heard her song &quot;Shy Baby&quot;, he took it to the producers of the show and as a result, it was used in the second-season finale &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Bosses&quot; of &quot;The 4400&quot;. &quot;Shy Baby&quot; went on to be included in &quot;The 4400&quot; soundtrack CD, released in April 2007.

== Art and painting ==
An avid painter (since working with Aaron Blabey on the Paul Cox film &quot;The Human Touch&quot;), McKenzie&#x27;s paintings have appeared in several publications, including &quot;Venice Magazine&quot; and &quot;OK!&quot;.

It was first developed during the early part of the 19th century when a handful of terraced houses were built to accommodate locals working in factories and mines and the area was created in 1845 out of land from Darlaston, Bilston and Wednesbury.

==Notable local events==
Moxley has been the subject of local headlines numerous times.

In May 1999, a semi-detached council house on Hughes Road was severely damaged when a disused mineshaft below the property collapsed causing all of the dwelling to collapse with it. As a result of the damage and weakened structure, the attached property also had to be demolished.

In January 2002, Walsall Council announces plans to demolish the 127-home estate around Harrowby Road (known as the Bradley Lodge estate when it was built by Bilston Council in the 1930s) due to mining subsidence, which already forced more than half of the estate&#x27;s residents to move. By February 2004, just 20 families remained on the estate and the first properties were demolished; this number had fallen to four by the autumn of 2005, by which time most of the demolition was complete. After July 2007 there was one resident still on the estate, who finally moved out in September 2013 more than a decade after the redevelopment of the estate was first planned, and more than six years after his last neighbour moved out. A new estate consisting of private and public sector housing has since been built on its site. The regeneration of Harrowby Road has also seen the demolition of flats and houses on neighbouring Belmont Gardens which dated from around 1970, with these properties being demolished during 2005.

A similar regeneration took place on nearby Curtin Drive in 2007, when two three-storey blocks of 1950s council flats were demolished, having stood derelict for several years and been subjected to extensive vandalism and arson attacks. New public sector housing has since been built on the site.

==Religion==
The All Saints&#x27; church, which is in the Anglican diocese of Lichfield is a prominent landmark in the area and still an active place of worship. There was also the Moxley Methodist Church, however it has since closed and was sold in 2020 for other uses.

==Transport==
It is centred on the historic London to Holyhead Road and, since the 1990s, has been bypassed by the Black Country New Road. The northern stub of the spine road links the main A41 road with the Black Country Route; both of these roads opened simultaneously in July 1995. The section of Church Street and Holyhead Road leading up to the junction with Bilston Road just over the border in Wednesbury was widened in 1997 to cope with spine road traffic, linking up with the remaining section of the route which gives an unbroken dual carriageway link with junction 1 of the M5 motorway at West Bromwich.

It has public transport connections with Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Wednesbury, Darlaston, and Walsall.

Moxley is served by the West Midlands Metro with a stop located in Bradley Lane, which was opened in 1999 along the route of a railway line which had been closed to passengers in 1972 but part of it remained open to freight trains until 1992.

Several public bus services serve Moxley these are list below:
* National Express West Midlands service 39 links the town to Stowlawn, Bilston, Darlaston and Walsall
* National Express West Midlands service 79 links the town with West Bromwich, Wednesbury, Darlaston, Bilston and Wolverhampton 
* Banga Bus (Monday to Saturday) &amp; National Express (Sunday) service 530 links the town with Rocket Pool, Bilston and Wolverhampton.
* Carolean Coaches service 23/23A links the town with Willenhall, Wednesbury and Portobello and Bilston.

On 5th January 2025 service 23 was taken over by Carolean and extended to Willenhall, under contract to TfWM. Service 80 was withdrawn and merged with the 23A to save costs.

==Education==
The nearest secondary school is The Grace Academy, approximately one mile away near Darlaston town centre.

The local primary school is Moorcroft Wood Primary School, which opened in September 2005 as result of the amalgamation of Moxley Infant School in Moxley Road, and Dorothy Purcell Junior School in Bull Lane. The school was split between the two sites for over a year until the Moxley Road site was closed and the infant department moved to the Bull Lane site in November 2006. Moxley Infant School, which was built in 1927, stood derelict for three years until its demolition. It is now a haulage yard. express and star 26 January 2012 - the school site has been proposed as the site for a new &#x27;Bail hostel&#x27; where convicted criminals will be incarcerated whilst on bail. Local opposition is very strong and a petition is underway and other protests being carried on. See the bail hostel in Moxley web site.

==Open space==
The most significant public open space in Moxley is Moorcroft Wood a Local Nature Reserve. In July 2020 it was announced that Moorcroft Wood was granted UNESCO Global Geopark status due to its mining history and large slag deposits from the Moorcroft Iron works.

==Community facilities==
The Moxley People&#x27;s Centre on Moxley High Street is a focus for the local community.

Adjacent to Moorcroft Wood is the Moorcroft Environment Centre operated by the Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country, it has since been closed down due to cut backs.

<doc id="1193939" wikidata="Q7987767" url="?curid=1193939" title="Western Cree syllabics">
<text>Western Cree syllabics are a variant of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics used to write Plains Cree, Woods Cree and the western dialects of Swampy Cree. It is used for all Cree dialects west of approximately the Manitoba–Ontario border in Canada, as opposed to Eastern Cree syllabics. It is also occasionally used by a few Cree speakers in the United States.

==Phonology of languages using Western Cree syllabics==

Western syllabics use only those characters needed to write the phonemes of the western dialects. The table below demonstrates the phonemes present in Western Cree dialects. Each sound is presented with a transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet along with the characters used to represent the sound in the &quot;Standard Roman Orthography&quot; used to teach Plains Cree.

Standard Roman Orthography consonants sound for the most part like their English equivalents. The key differences being that and are never aspirated and that the letter is used to represent .

Western Cree dialects have between 6 and 7 vowels distinguishing between short and long vowels. Short vowels are written standard Latin characters while long vowels are written either with a macron or a circumflex. , written is always long and has no short counterpart.

==Inventory==

Cree syllabics uses different glyphs to indicate consonants, and changes the orientation of these glyphs to indicate the vowel that follows it. The basic principles of Canadian syllabic writing are outlined in the article for Canadian Aboriginal syllabics.

Notes:

Note that the th-series closely resembles the y-series characters. The th phoneme in Woods Cree appears where a y is found in Plains or an n in Swampy Cree. Recognising the relationship between the th and y sounds, Cree writers use a modification of the y-series.

In addition to these characters, western Cree syllabics indicates the w phoneme by placing a dot after the syllable. (This is the reverse of the Eastern Cree convention.) Thus, the syllable wa is indicated with ᐘ, pwi by ᐽ and so on. The dot used to mark the w can be combined with the dot marking length. The syllable wâ is marked as ᐚ and pwî as ᐿ. The dot used to indicate w is placed &quot;before&quot; the syllable in Eastern Cree syllabics. This and the way finals are written are the two principal differences between eastern and western Cree syllabics.

The dot placed above syllables with long vowels is often dropped in real texts unless necessary to disambiguate the word. Long and short vowels may be written identically and require context to disambiguate.

Also, western Cree writers may use the character ᙮ to indicate the end of sentence, instead of the Roman alphabet period so that it is not confused with the diacritic indicating the w sound.

An example of Plains Cree written in western syllabics:

English translation:

:The young people then began to speak in the language of his ancestry – Nêhiyawêwin (Plains Cree language). Unfortunately the young man could not make out what they were saying even though he was of the same nation; Nêhiyaw (Plains Cree people).

<doc id="1193940" wikidata="Q3512105" url="?curid=1193940" title="Buster Merryfield">
<text>Harry &quot;Buster&quot; Merryfield (27 November 1920 – 23 June 1999) was an English actor best known for starring as Uncle Albert in the BBC comedy &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;.

==Early life==
Merryfield was born and raised in Battersea, London, England. His father, also called Harry, was a fitter, and his mother Lily (née Stone) was a part-time waitress. His sister Irene died when she was eight years old. He was given the name &quot;Buster&quot; by his grandfather, as he weighed nine pounds at birth, and it stuck throughout his entire life. He refused to divulge his real name, which only became known after his death.

He followed a strict fitness regime of daily press-ups and swimming sessions. As a boxer, he was a British schoolboy champion in 1936 and Southern Command army champion in 1945. He was also an amateur football player and Millwall supporter, regularly attending games at the Old Den. In contrast to his pipe-smoking and rum-drinking character Uncle Albert, Merryfield was a teetotaller and non-smoker his entire life.

==Career==
Before turning professional as an actor, Merryfield was a keen amateur actor and director. His productions of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1966), &quot;The World–My Canvas&quot; (1968) by Ruth Dixon and &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; (1969) by Arthur Miller, for the now-defunct amateur theatre group the Characters, won Best Play at the Woking Drama Festival in 1966, 1968 and 1969 respectively. He also won the Best Actor trophy for his roles in &quot;The Entertainer&quot; and &quot;The World–My Canvas&quot;.

Merryfield became a professional actor at the age of 57, after having worked for the Westminster Bank for nearly 40 years. He began work there on 11 July 1938 and passed his banking exams in 1939. During his time with the bank, he reached the position of senior area manager, but his banking career was interrupted by his war service. He spent the war in the army, where his physique allowed him to become a PT and jungle-warfare instructor. Awarded an emergency commission in the Royal Artillery on 13 March 1942, Merryfield was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. During the war, he discovered his love of acting when he served as an entertainment officer staging shows for the troops.

After the war, the now married Merryfield returned to the bank. At NatWest he rose through the ranks. In April 1967 he became manager of the Shepperton sub-branch and by the time of his early retirement in July 1978, he was a bank manager at the Thames Ditton branch in Surrey. After retiring, Merryfield persuaded a repertory company to admit him. He performed at the Connaught Theatre in Worthing in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat&quot; and &quot;Equus&quot;. Merryfield appeared in some small television parts, including &quot;Hannah&quot; in 1980, as Professor Challis in &quot;The Citadel&quot; in 1983 and as a bishop in &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; in 1984.

Merryfield joined &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; in January 1985 as the former seafaring Albert Gladstone Trotter, known as Uncle Albert, who was Grandad Trotter&#x27;s long-lost younger brother and was known for his catchphrase of &quot;During the war...&quot;. The character was added after Lennard Pearce, who played Grandad, died in December 1984. Nine months earlier in March 1984, Merryfield and Pearce had costarred in two episodes of a &quot;Shroud for a Nightingale&quot;. Merryfield did much work for charities such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He wrote his autobiography, &quot;During the War and Other Encounters&quot;, in 1996.

In December 1997, Merryfield fell at the British Comedy Awards while walking to the stage to collect an award for David Jason for his part in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. Despite cutting his forehead, he continued and collected the award. Merryfield appeared in pantomime during Christmas of 1997 and 1998 in the father role in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; at the Pavilion Theatre, Bournemouth.

==Personal life==
Merryfield could play the piano by ear but could not read music. He was also a fan of disco dancing.

==Death==
Merryfield died at Poole General Hospital on 23 June 1999 as a result of a brain tumour. He was survived by his wife Iris, whom he had married in June 1942, his daughter and two grandchildren. He was buried at Verwood Cemetery, Dorset. Iris died on 5 November 2002 and was buried alongside him.

<text>Brigadier John Sherwood Kelly (13 January 1880 – 18 August 1931) was a South African recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The four-times-wounded Kelly was not a Regular officer but a formidable and experienced commander with a combat record going back to the 1896 Matabele Revolt.

During his military career he achieved fame and notoriety for his mixture of heroic exploits and explosive temperament. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his exploits in Gallipoli in February 1916 and on 1 January 1917 was awarded the Companion of St Michael and St George (CMG). During the summer and autumn of 1917 he commanded 1st Battalion, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and was instrumental in the early success achieved during the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November for which he received the Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 23 January 1918. Kelly was gassed and wounded at various times.

Sherwood-Kelly was born in Queenstown in the Cape Colony (modern Eastern Cape province) to an Anglo (English-speaking) family. His father, James Kelly, was born in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland and settled in South Africa after serving in the British Army. His mother, Elizabeth Didcott, was born in Winchester, Hampshire and followed her husband to South Africa when he purchased a farm on the &quot;veld&quot; in the early 1870s. James Kelly served in the para-military Frontier Armed and Mounted Police, and as such the Kelly family was itinerant, moving about from one place to another in the Cape Colony. The longest period that Sherwood-Kelly stayed in one place during his youth was when his father was stationed in the area that later became Transkei. 

His mother died when he was 12 and his twin brother was killed falling from a horse when he was 13. His father subsequently married their governess giving him three half-siblings. He was educated in South Africa at Grahamstown (St. Andrew&#x27;s College and St Aidan&#x27;s), King Williamstown (Dale College) and Queenstown (Queen&#x27;s College). From his earliest years, Sherwood-Kelly was known in the words of the British historian Roderick Bailey as &quot;an outspoken man with a fiery temper&quot;.

At the age of 16 he fought in Matebeleland. He joined the para-military Cape Mounted Police and was at the Relief of Mafeking in South Africa. During the Second Boer War, Sherwood-Kelly served as a lieutenant with the Imperial Light Horse that was used to hunt down the Boer &quot;kommandos&quot; on the &quot;veld&quot;. He joined the Somaliland Burgher Corps fighting Diiriye Guure of the Darawiish. During his time in Somaliland, Sherwood-Kelly&#x27;s insubordination led him being demoted first to the rank of sergeant and then private. Upon his return to South Africa, Sherwood-Kelly went into business as the recruiter of black labour for the gold mines of the Witwatersrand and the diamond mines of the Kimberly range. In 1906 he took part in the suppression of the Bambatha Rebellion. After he was finished his service in Zululand, he married an Australian woman, Nellie, whose parents came to South Africa during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush. Prior to the outbreak of the First World War he was housemaster at Langley School, Loddon, Norfolk (England) and a member of the Territorial Force in the United Kingdom.

==First World War==
===Gallipoli campaign===
In November 1914, Sherwood-Kelly was gazetted a major with the 10th Norfolk regiment. He repeatedly requested a transfer and was sent to the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers in July 1915.

At the Battle of Gallipoli, he commanded a regular army Scottish battalion and was awarded a DSO. He arrived on the Gallipoli peninsula in July 1915 at a time when the battle was already stalemated with the Allies unable to storm the heights of Gallipoli while the Ottomans were unable to push the Allies back into the sea. Sherwood-Kelly&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Bomb Kelly&quot; owing to his enthusiasm for tossing Mills bombs into the Ottoman lines during the trench raids. The official history of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borders marveled that Sherwood-Kelly &quot;had a quite remarkable disregard for danger&quot;. On 15 October 1915, the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel G.B. Stoney was killed by an Ottoman shell that levelled the battalion&#x27;s HQ. Captain G.S. Stirling-Cookson served as the acting commanding officer until 28 October 1915 when Sherwood-Kelly took command. The British historian Peter E. Hodgkinson noted there was a lacuna in the war diary of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borders regarding Sherwood-Kelly who was not mentioned once between October 1915-January 1916 despite being the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer, which he suggested was due to his unpopularity with his fellow officers as &quot;an outsider and empire ranker commanding a regular unit&quot;.

===Western Front===
In January 1916, he arrived in France to take up service briefly as the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment. On 4 June 1916, his time on the front was cut short by a German bullet that went through his left lung, taking him out of action for much of the rest of 1916. In October 1916, he applied to join the 10th Norfolk regiment under the grounds that &quot;some officers and many of the men present in camp who served with the 1st Battalion under my command&quot;. In March 1917, he was assigned command of the 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.

He was 37 years old, and an Acting Lieutenant-Colonel in the Norfolk Regiment, British Army, Commanding Officer 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 November 1917 during the Battle of Cambrai at Marcoing, France, when a party of men were held upon the near side of a canal by heavy rifle fire, Lieutenant Colonel Sherwood Kelly at once ordered covering fire, personally led his leading company across the canal and then reconnoitered, under heavy fire, the high ground held by the enemy. He took a Lewis gun team, forced his way through obstacles and covered the advance of his battalion, enabling them to capture the position. Later he led a charge against some pits from which heavy fire was coming, capturing five machine-guns and 46 prisoners.

Sherwood-Kelly&#x27;s citation for the VC published in &quot;&#x27;The London Gazette&quot; on 8 January 1918 read: &quot;For most conspicuous bravery and fearless leading when a party of men of another unit detailed to cover the passage of the canal by his battalion were held up on the near side of the canal by heavy rifle fire directed on the bridge. Lt.-Col. Sherwood-Kelly at once ordered covering fire, personally led the leading company of his battalion across the canal and, after crossing, reconnoitred under heavy rifle and machine gun fire the high ground held by the enemy.&lt;br&gt;The left flank of his battalion advancing to the assault of this objective was held up by a thick belt of wire, whereupon he crossed to that flank, and with a Lewis gun team, forced his way under heavy fire through obstacles, got the gun into position on the far side, and covered the advance of his battalion through the wire, thereby enabling them to capture the position.&lt;br&gt;Later, he personally led a charge against some pits from which a heavy fire was being directed on his men, captured the pits, together with five machine guns and forty-six prisoners, and killed a large number of the enemy.&lt;br&gt;The great gallantry displayed by this officer throughout the day inspired the greatest confidence in his men, and it was mainly due to his example and devotion to duty that his battalion was enabled to capture and hold their objective&quot;.

In late 1917, Sherwood-Kelly survived a German gas attack that put him into the hospital. On 12 January 1918, Sherwood-Kelly arrived at Buckingham Palace to be personally awarded the VC by King George V. It was decided that he was not fit enough to return to the front and instead he returned to South Africa as part of a recruiting campaign for volunteers as South Africa only sent volunteers to fight overseas. During his visit, he caused controversy when he appeared on the stage with J. B. M. Hertzog, a Boer general turned leading Afrikaner &#x27;republican&#x27; (i.e anti-British) politician. While standing next to Hertzog, he gave a speech calling for the Dominions like South Africa to have greater independence within the British Empire. In September 1918, he returned to the Western Front as commanding officer of the 12th Norfolk regiment, a position he held until the end of the war on 11 November 1918.

==North Russia==
According to Field Marshal Lord Ironside&#x27;s account published in 1953, the second battalion of the Hampshire Regiment on 19 June 1919 under Kelly&#x27;s command as part of the North Russia Campaign &quot;failed to take any part in the fight&quot; at Troitsa, &quot;a village encampment on the River Dvina and about 180 miles south-east from Archangel as the crow flies&quot;. When Ironside interviewed Kelly the following day, Kelly could not explain the 2nd Hampshires&#x27; failure to take part in the action; had Kelly been a Regular officer, explained Ironside, he would &quot;certainly have had him court martialled.&quot; In view of Kelly&#x27;s outstanding war record, Ironside merely withdrew the 2nd Hampshires from the line and directed that Kelly be sent home for demobilisation. According to the Brigade Operation Report, however, Kelly&#x27;s column at Troitsa was successful at first but then withdrew as he considered the position insecure and was having difficulty obtaining ammunition supplies; when ordered to resume the attack, Kelly declined to do so.

According to Kelly&#x27;s account given shortly after to his brigadier, a series of factors accounted for his withdrawal: slow and difficult approach through marshy woods, lack of information about the progress of other columns, stiff resistance by the enemy Bolsheviks, the danger of encirclement and lack of ammunition. In the event, Kelly was not relieved of his command and sent home as Ironside (in his own words) had &quot;decided to give him a second chance.&quot; Kelly was not dismissed until 17 August 1919 and then for quite different reasons than the Troista affair.

In mid-April 1919, Sir Keith Price, a head of production at the Ministry of Munitions, wrote to the War Office urging the use of new variants of gas against the Bolsheviks in the North Russian theatre. Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for War and Air, was enthusiastic in his support but was concerned at revealing the new gas in the course of a relatively small campaign. Churchill&#x27;s concerns having been addressed, massive preparations for the use of the new gas were undertaken. As a trial of the new weapon Kelly, who was now in command of a very mixed outfit on the railway front as part of the Vologda Force, was ordered to carry out a raid on the Bolsheviks under cover of a large ground discharge of gas. Kelly objected less against the gas as against the raid itself whose purposes in his view could be achieved by other methods. The gas raid, due on 17 August 1919, never took place. Kelly was then replaced as commanding officer of his unit and sent back to Britain; the formal reason for his removal was that he had &quot;remarked adversely on matters of military import&quot;, criticised his superiors and divulged military secrets in a letter to a friend in England; the contents of the letter constituted a court martial offence.

On his arrival back in Britain, Kelly wrote a series of letters to the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, both published by Lord Beaverbrook and both opposed to the North Russia Campaign. The first letter appeared on 6 September 1919 in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. In his letter, Sherwood-Kelly wrote that he had volunteered in April 1919 for service in Russia &quot;in the sincere belief that relief was urgently needed in order to make possible the withdrawal of low category troops, in the last stages of exhaustion, due to fierce fighting amid the rigors of an Arctic winter&quot;. Upon arriving in Archangel, Sherwood-Kelly wrote that he &quot;received the impression that the policy of the authorities was not what it was stated to be&quot; and that &quot;the troops of the Relief Force which we were told had been sent out for defensive purposes were being used for offensive purposes, on a large scale and far into the interior, in furtherance of some ambitious plan of campaign the nature of which we were not permitted to know&quot;. Sherwood-Kelly also wrote that the &quot;much vaulted &#x27;loyal Russian army&#x27;, was composed largely of Bolshevik prisoners dressed in khaki, it was utterly unreliable, ever disposed to mutiny, and always constituted a greater danger to our troops than the Bolsheviks opposed to them&quot;. Finally, Sherwood-Kelly charged that many of the British, Australian, and Canadian soldiers did not understand why they were fighting the Red Army above the Arctic Circle after the armistice had ended the First World War. A War Office spokesman published a rebuttal, only for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to publish an interview given by Ironside in June 1919, in which he spoke of plans to advance deep into Russia. The interview had been published in the &quot;Gazette of the Archangel Forces&quot; newspaper and had been banned by the government, but Sherwood-Kelly leaked a copy to the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. 

Urgent consultations within government as to a possible court martial for Kelly followed the publication.

&quot;A court martial would be an unusual disciplinary procedure for an officer, rare for one of Kelly&#x27;s rank, unprecedented for one so well decorated, four times wounded (twice gassed) and nine times mentioned in despatches.&quot;

Initially the Adjutant General advised against a court martial, suggesting instead that Kelly be removed from the army administratively for misconduct as permitted by an article of the Pay Warrant. However, after the publication by Beaverbrook of a second Kelly letter Churchill favoured Kelly&#x27;s swift court martial for writing to the newspapers but without reference to anything which had happened or was alleged to have happened in Russia. Kelly was arrested on 13 October 1919; his court martial took place on 28 October 1919 in Westminster Guildhall on the charge of having written three letters to the press on 5 September, 12 September and 6 October 1919 after his return from Russia. Kelly pleaded guilty to contravention of the King&#x27;s Regulations which provided that an officer was,

&quot;forbidden to publish in any form whatsoever or communicate, either directly or indirectly, to the Press any military information or his views on any military subject without special authority.&quot;

Many of the men serving in North Russia approved of Sherwood-Kelly&#x27;s actions. Petty Officer Reginald Jowett, serving abroad the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Pegasus&quot;, wrote in his diary: &quot;Lt. Colonel Sherwood Kelly&#x27;s scathing indictment of the Government&#x27;s policy, published in the papers about Sept 8th, which have just reached us, is causing a good deal of comment around here, as we all know how true it is. The &#x27;High Official&#x27; of the War Office, who terms his statements as &quot;biased and unfounded&quot; is that peculiar animal known as the &quot;armchair critic&quot;, who has probably never been within a thousand miles of Archangel. To those of us who have been here, his statements against Kelly simply makes him look foolish, but I expect he is just trying to shield the Gov&#x27;t as usual...All the men who have been up-river are unanimous in declaring that the conditions spoken of by Lt. Colonel Kelly in his articles in the newspapers are absolutely so, so I wonder how the High Official of the War Office would answer all these witnesses&quot;. 

Kelly presented a plea in mitigation and various documents to support his case. He concluded,

&quot;I plead with you to believe that the action I took was to protect my men&#x27;s lives against needless sacrifice and to save the country from squandering wealth it could ill afford.&quot;

He was found guilty and severely reprimanded. Two weeks later he relinquished his commission, being allowed to retain the rank of lieutenant colonel. Pursued by a neglected wife and various creditors, he was unsuccessful in his many attempts to re-enter the army and even failed to obtain a place in the French Foreign Legion.

==Politics==
During the political instability of 1923–24, Jack Kelly stood for the Conservative Party at two general elections for the constituency of Clay Cross in Derbyshire. His controversial and outspoken style struck a chord even among hardened socialist supporters in this largely mining seat. He was defeated in the December 1923 elections by 6,000 votes but had reduced this by half a year later in the election of October 1924. During the election rallies, Kelly again hit the national headlines having thrashed some hecklers at Langwith.

==Later work==
In later years, Kelly worked for Bolivia Concessions Limited building roads and railways across Bolivia and went big game hunting in Africa where he contracted malaria, from which he subsequently died on 18 August 1931, aged just fifty-one. He was granted a full military funeral and buried at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey, England.

==The Medal==
His VC is displayed at the National Museum of Military History in Johannesburg, South Africa. &quot;He is commemorated at St Anne&#x27;s Cathedral, Belfast, and at Delville Wood, France. He is also remembered at the Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum in Norwich, and the National Portrait Gallery has two portraits of him&quot;.

<text>Ashfield Boys High School is a government-funded comprehensive single-sex secondary school for boys, located on Liverpool Road, in Ashfield, an inner western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Established in 1962, the school had 771 enrollments in 2023, of whom two percent identified as Indigenous Australians and 64 percent as being from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education in accordance with a curriculum developed by the New South Wales Education Standards Authority; the principal is Dwayne Hopwood.
The High school had two names before Ashfield Boys High School, Ashfield Superior School and Ashfield Superior Technical School.

==History==

Part of the school land area was once used by the Australian Army. The land (gym and sheds) have since been acquired by the school and the site rebuilt.

The Drill Hall was built in the 1800s and was home to the local citizen militia and other volunteer military units. In 1913 the land was acquired by the Department of Defence as the Ashfield Corps continued to grow. In 1915 it was the second to last stop for the Gilgandra Rifle Club on their Cooee March before 240 men were sent to war. In 1939 the Army sheds were built to house armoured vehicles (25 in total). The last company to be stationed at the depot were the 3 Company Royal Australian Army Service Corps Infantry Division, leaving in the 1960s.

=== Royal visit ===
On 4 November 2014, His Royal Highness Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, then The Earl of Wessex, visited Ashfield Boys High School. The visit was to mark the 50th anniversary of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award in Australia. The Prince met with students from eight Sydney inner west schools.

<text>Dragon Runner is a military robot built for urban combat. At 20 pounds (9 kg) it is light enough to be carried and thrown. The original project was funded by the United States Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. It was designed at Carnegie Mellon University while the electronics and thermoplastic shell is developed and made by QinetiQ, Inc. Early development was conducted by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, including initial design, production and field-testing.

== Technical details ==
The robot has four wheels, is 15 inches (38 cm) long, less than a foot wide, and 5 inches (13 cm) in height. The robot is very rugged, and can be thrown over fences, up or down stairwells, from a moving vehicle at 45 miles per hour (70 km/h), or even from a third-story window. It does not matter how it lands because neither side is the right side up. However, it was not designed to drive up or down stairs on its own. Instead, Dragon Runner was designed so that it could be carried up the stairway.

In January 2010, under a contract worth £12m with QinetiQ, around 100 Dragon Runners were ordered by the British army to improve the ability of bomb disposal experts to find and deactivate improvised explosive devices on the front line in Afghanistan. The first in use were then already proving its worth against the threat of roadside bombs.

==Use==
Dragon Runner is designed for areas that are too dangerous for or inaccessible by human soldiers, particularly urban terrain. Dragon Runner&#x27;s front-mounted, tilting camera provides a video feed that is relayed back to its master controller by a wireless modem. It provides soldiers with a view around corners and other obstructions that prevent them from seeing hidden enemies.

Dragon Runner can be operated in three different modes: 
*Drive Mode: The robot drives around, transmitting images back to the operator.
*Sentry Mode: Dragon Runner remains stationary, using a microphone and sensors that can detect motion up to away. If it detects something, it will alert the operator.
*Watch Mode: The robot remains motionless and relays images back to the operator.
Modifications include flippers that enable it to climb stairs and treads that can all be snapped on quickly and easily in the field by a soldier with no tools.

<text>Robert Shields VC (c. 1827 – 23 December 1864) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross. He was born in Cardiff, Wales, in 1827 and died in Bombay, India, in 1864.

==Details==
On the morning of 8 September 1856, during the Crimean War, Corporal Robert Shields volunteered to go along with Assistant Surgeon William Henry Thomas Sylvester in order to rescue an injured officer who had been incapacitated by a shot not far from their position outside the city of Sevastopol&#x27;s walls during the siege of the city.

The wounded officer was one Lieutenant Dyneley, the Adjutant of Shields&#x27; own unit in the Royal Welch Fusiliers regiment. He had been shot and wounded near the Redan, a fort built close to Sevastopol, at this time it had been hastily occupied by more than a dozen Russian soldiers. It was an extremely dangerous and foolhardy thing to venture anywhere close to the Redan, as they would be well within range of all manner of enemy guns. Nevertheless, Sylvester and Shields decided to attempt to save the wounded man.

Together, they reached the lieutenant; however, they quickly noticed that his wounds were far more serious than they had anticipated. Sylvester dressed Dyneley&#x27;s wounds as well as he was able while under heavy fire from the Redan and returned to the cover of their trenches, bringing with them the injured man. Dyneley later died from his wounds.

For their bravery, both men were awarded the Victoria Cross, subsequently going on parade for the first presentation of the new medal. Sixty other men were present at Hyde Park on 26 June 1857. The recipients were made up of both the army and the navy, and they were presented with the award by Queen Victoria herself.

Later, after being posted to India at the end of the war, Robert Shields died in Bombay of complications from alcoholism on 23 December 1864. He was buried in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay. It has been claimed that Shields was the first Welsh VC winner, but the first Welshman to earn a VC was Hugh Rowlands, who was also granted his award in February 1857.

<doc id="1193955" wikidata="Q1346255" url="?curid=1193955" title="John McGeoch">
<text>John Alexander McGeoch (25 August 1955 – 4 March 2004) was a musician and songwriter. He is best known as the guitarist of the rock bands Magazine (1977–1980) and Siouxsie and the Banshees (1980–1982).

He has been described as one of the most influential guitarists of his generation. In 1996 he was listed by &quot;Mojo&quot; in their &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; for his work on the Siouxsie and the Banshees song &quot;Spellbound&quot;. Signature characteristics of his playing style included inventive arpeggios, string harmonics, the uses of flanger and an occasional disregard for conventional scales.

He was also a member of the bands Visage (1979–1980), the Armoury Show (1983–1986) and Public Image Ltd (1986–1992).

McGeoch has been cited as an influence by guitarists such as Johnny Marr, Jonny Greenwood, Ed O&#x27;Brien, the Edge, John Frusciante, Robert Smith, Steve Albini, Duane Denison, James Dean Bradfield and Dave Navarro.

==Early life==
McGeoch was born on 25 August 1955 in Greenock, Renfrewshire, Scotland, where he spent his childhood years. He began to play the guitar at 12 years of age, first learning British blues music, being influenced by the work of Eric Clapton, and also that of Jimi Hendrix. He took piano lessons for five years until the age of twelve. When his parents bought him a guitar, he stopped piano. In 1970 he played with a local band called the &#x27;Slugband&#x27;. In 1971 his parents moved to London.

In 1975 he went to art school in Manchester where he received a degree in Fine Art. In his final year in 1976, he was enraptured by a new music that &quot;ended up being called punk rock&quot;. He qualified it &quot;the revolution, and I really do think that&#x27;s the right word for it&quot;. He maintained an interest in photography, painting and drawing throughout his life.

==Career==
===1977–1980: Magazine Visage===
In April 1977 McGeoch&#x27;s Manchester student flatmate Malcolm Garrett introduced him to Howard Devoto, who had recently left the band Buzzcocks and was looking for a guitarist to form a band with. The pair formed a new act entitled Magazine, along with Barry Adamson, Bob Dickinson and Martin Jackson. The new band released its debut single, &quot;Shot by Both Sides&quot; in January 1978. The song&#x27;s music was written by Pete Shelley with new Devoto lyrics (the Buzzcocks version was titled &quot;Lipstick&quot;); on release it reached #41 on the UK Singles Chart. (The same year McGeoch graduated from Manchester Polytechnic).

McGeoch went on to play on Magazine&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;Real Life&quot; (1978), &quot;Secondhand Daylight&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Correct Use of Soap&quot; (1980). He left the band in 1980 shortly after the release of the latter album, frustrated with its lack of commercial success despite its recognition with music press critics.

In 1979, while still a member of Magazine, McGeoch joined Steve Strange&#x27;s electronic band Visage along with erstwhile Magazine bandmates Adamson and Dave Formula, recording songs for their first single &quot;Tar&quot; and later, in 1980, for their eponymous album &quot;Visage&quot;, McGeoch playing guitar and saxophone on the record.

Although he saw Visage as something of a joke, the band provided McGeoch with early professional credibility and success. The band&#x27;s single &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; went to #1 in a number of European countries and McGeoch said the money from the song allowed him to buy a house. McGeoch did not record on the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Anvil&quot;, as it was recorded in London and he was unable to participate.

While still a member of Magazine and Visage, McGeoch also worked occasionally with other bands. In mid-1980 he recorded most of the guitar work on Gen X&#x27;s album &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; at AIR Studios in London. He left Magazine during that time. In September 1980 he guested with Skids for a Peel Session, standing in for Stuart Adamson who was unwell. Other session work included Tina Turner&#x27;s comeback track with the British Electric Foundation and for Propaganda He also collaborated with ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle on Ken Lockie&#x27;s album &quot;The Impossible&quot;.

===1980–1982: Siouxsie and the Banshees===
When recording with Siouxsie and the Banshees in early 1980, McGeoch entered a period of both creative and commercial success. During his first session with the Banshees he began a new style of playing. He later commented: &quot;I was going through a picky phase, as opposed to strumming. &quot;Happy House&quot; was lighter and had more musicality in it. They invited me to join. I was sad leaving Magazine but the Banshees were so interesting and it felt like a good move&quot;. He became an official member of the group at the release of &quot;Israel&quot; in November 1980, which was the first single he composed with the band.

He recorded guitar on the Banshees&#x27; long-players &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1980), &quot;Juju&quot; (1981) and &quot;A Kiss in the Dreamhouse&quot; (1982). The Banshees&#x27; hit singles of this era featured some of McGeoch&#x27;s most acclaimed work, particularly 1980&#x27;s &quot;Happy House&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;Israel&quot;, and 1981&#x27;s &quot;Spellbound&quot; and &quot;Arabian Knights&quot;. McGeoch&#x27;s contribution to the band was important in terms of sounds and style. Singer Siouxsie Sioux later said: However, McGeoch suffered a nervous breakdown due to the stresses of touring and an increasing personal problem with alcohol. He arrived in Madrid for a promotional stay in bad state and made several uncharacteristic mistakes at a gig. Back home, he was forced to leave the band in October 1982 to rest and recover.

===1983–1986: The Armoury Show===
In 1983, during a break from playing music, he produced Swedish punk-funk band Zzzang Tumb&#x27;s debut long-player.

He joined the band the Armoury Show which included Doyle as well as ex-Skids members Richard Jobson and Russell Webb. Their album &quot;Waiting for the Floods&quot; released in 1985, features some of McGeoch&#x27;s best guitar work. He contributed to former Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy&#x27;s debut solo long-player &quot;Should the World Fail to Fall Apart&quot;.

===1986–1992: Public Image Ltd===
In 1986, McGeoch joined John Lydon&#x27;s Public Image Ltd, a decision which may have been partly motivated by financial difficulties he was in at this time. He had been an admirer of PiL, particularly of Lydon&#x27;s lyrics, yet reportedly had previously turned down an offer from him to join the band in 1984. Despite being struck in the face with a bottle thrown from the crowd during one of his first gigs with the band, McGeoch remained with PiL until it disbanded in 1992, making him the longest-serving member apart from Lydon. He recorded on its long-players: &quot;Happy?&quot;, &quot;9&quot; and &quot;That What Is Not&quot;.

In 1992 he was invited by the Icelandic band the Sugarcubes to play the lead guitar on the song &quot;Gold&quot; for their &quot;Stick Around for Joy&quot; long-player.

===1993–2004: Last years===
Without a band, he ended his career seeking to form one via a variety of short-lived ventures, including working with Glenn Gregory and the songwriter/producer Keith Lowndes. With John Keeble of Spandau Ballet and vocalist Clive Farrington of When in Rome, he formed a line-up provisionally titled &#x27;Pacific&#x27;, but no commercial material came of it.

In the mid-1990s McGeoch retired from professional music and trained as a nurse/carer. In the early 2000s he was reported as attempting to re-enter professional music by working on musical scores for television productions.

==Equipment==
During his time with Magazine McGeoch played a Yamaha SG1000 guitar with a stand-mounted MXR M117R flanger. He bought his first model in 1977 when the band signed its recording deal, which provided him with the finances for professional standard equipment. Whilst with Siouxsie and the Banshees he created his own setup, involving a MXR flanger mounted on a mic stand which allowed him to hit a chord and sweep the flange knob in real time. He also played on a 12 String Ovation acoustic guitar. He also used a MXR Dynacomp Compressor and a Yamaha Analog Delay. His amps were a Roland Jazz Chorus JC120 and two Marshall MV50 combos. His use of flange and chorus added depth and space to his parts. During the recording sessions of &quot;Juju&quot;, he used devices such as the Gizmo on &quot;Into the light&quot;, and an EBow on &quot;Sin in My Heart&quot;.

Whilst working with &#x27;The Armoury Show&#x27;, he also used a customised Telecaster, a white Squier 1957 Stratocaster, an Ibanez AE410BK and an Ibanez AE100. For pedals, alongside his &#x27;flanger on a stick&#x27;, he was using an MXR Compressor, two Ibanez harmonisers and an Ibanez Super Metal pedal. During his work with PiL, and in his last years he favoured a solid wood Carvin electric guitar. He also used a Washburn Tour 24 guitar for touring during 1988.

==Legacy==
McGeoch has been cited as a major influence by numerous guitarists. Johnny Marr from the Smiths said: &quot;When I was in my teens, there weren&#x27;t many new guitar players who were interesting and of their time.[...] John McGeoch. [His work] was really innovative guitar music which was pretty hard to find back then. To a young guitar player like myself, those early Banshees singles were just class&quot;. Simon Goddard wrote that McGeoch was a &quot;significant inspiration&quot; on Marr. Marr said: &quot;Really my generation was all about a guy called John McGeoch, from Siouxsie and the Banshees&quot;. Marr also stated: &quot;The music he made with the Banshees … the word imperial was made for that music&quot;.

Radiohead have cited McGeoch&#x27;s work with Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees as an influence. The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, said McGeoch was the guitarist that had most influenced him. The Radiohead guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien also cited him as a &quot;big influence&quot;, and one of the &quot;great guitarists [who] weren&#x27;t lead guitarists&quot;. He said that McGeoch was &quot;responsible for some of the greatest riffs ever ... &#x27;Spellbound&#x27;, &#x27;Christine&#x27;, &#x27;Happy House&#x27;... His riffs are so elegant and once you learn how to play them there is almost a zen like quality to the sound and movement of your hands. It reminds me of the beauty in Johnny Marr&#x27;s playing.&quot; For Radiohead&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;There There&quot;, their producer, Nigel Godrich, encouraged Greenwood to play like McGeoch in Siouxsie and the Banshees. 

Dave Navarro of Jane&#x27;s Addiction said that he &quot;always loved all the different guitarists that have been in Siouxsie and the Banshees&quot;. John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers named McGeoch in his primary influences: &quot;[McGeoch] is such a guitarist I aspire to be. He has a new brilliant idea for each song. I usually play on the stuff he does on Magazine&#x27;s albums and Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees&#x27;s like &quot;Juju&quot;.&quot; Frusciante praised him as a musician &quot;who played in more textural ways&quot; and who made &quot;interesting music&quot;. Frusciante &quot;bought an SG, because I&#x27;m a big fan of John McGeoch from Siouxsie and the Banshees and Magazine. When I&#x27;d play along with his records using a Strat, the parts sounded too thin and weak for the simple power of his playing. In learning the SG, I had to teach myself to bend in a brand-new way and use new muscles to do vibrato.&quot;

The Edge of U2 cited McGeoch as an influence and chose the Siouxsie and the Banshees song &quot;Christine&quot; for a compilation made for &quot;Mojo&quot;. Interviewed in March 1987, the Edge said his &quot;background is much more Tom Verlaine and John McGeoch&quot;. Robert Smith of the Cure praised McGeoch&#x27;s guitar part on &quot;Head Cut&quot;, including it in his five favourite guitar tracks: &quot;This is really harsh funk in a weird way – clever choppy chords.&quot; Roddy Frame of Aztec Camera praised McGeoch saying, &quot;he chose very simple lines over anything bombastic... the song came first and he tried to complement that&quot;. In a playlist, William Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected two of McGeoch&#x27;s songs, &quot;Spellbound&quot; by the Banshees and &quot;Definitive Gaze&quot; by Magazine.

Steve Albini of Big Black praised McGeoch for his guitar playing with Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees, qualifying as &quot;great choral swells, great scratches and buzzes, great dissonant noise and great squealy death noise. What a guy&quot; and further commenting: &quot;anybody can make notes. There&#x27;s no trick. What is a trick and a good one is to make a guitar do things that don&#x27;t sound like a guitar at all. The point here is stretching the boundaries&quot;. Albini also stated: &quot;He was an innovator with the pure sound of his guitar... I admire the economy of his playing. He made very precise choices that were usually beautifully simple&quot;. Duane Denison of the Jesus Lizard chose McGeoch as his favorite guitarist for his work with Magazine and the Banshees, especially on &quot;Juju&quot;, saying: &quot;his playing was atmospheric and aggressive&quot; and &quot;truly inspiring to me&quot;. Mark Arm of Mudhoney &quot;loved [McGeoch&#x27;s] work with Magazine and Siouxsie And The Banshees&quot;. Arm praised McGeoch&#x27;s musical approach, saying: &quot;He&#x27;s got a very unique style... He&#x27;s a very original thinker and not an &#x27;overplayer&#x27; – the little bits where he does a solo are really innovative and super-cool... Space is key, a secret ingredient for musicians which shouldn&#x27;t be a secret. Knowing when to step back – John had that ability&quot;. Guided by Voices&#x27;s guitarist Doug Gillard said that &quot;McGeoch... was a big influence.&quot;

Terry Bickers of the House of Love cited him as one of his favourite musicians. James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers said that McGeoch was &quot;slightly avant-garde. He was a genius&quot;. Bradfield added that McGeoch&#x27;s guitar-playing makes &quot;you realize you were listening to a new version of rock and roll&quot;. 

Stuart Braithwaite of Mogwai qualified McGeoch as &quot;the best post-punk guitarist&quot;, saying, &quot;he played like no-one else, totally distinct and with unyielding imagination. I hear his influence everywhere to this day&quot;, and dubbed him &quot;a total legend&quot;. James Graham of the Twilight Sad cited him as one &quot;of the guitarists I still continue to revisit when I&#x27;m writing. The ideas they were coming up with at the time still sound as fresh just now as they did back then&quot;.

In 2008, the BBC aired an hour-long radio documentary on McGeoch&#x27;s life and work, titled &quot;Spellbound: The John McGeoch Story&quot;.

In April 2022, &quot;The Light Pours Out of Me&quot;, an authorised biography of McGeoch by Rory Sullivan-Burke, was released by Omnibus Press. It features interviews with guitarists Greenwood, Marr, Frusciante and singers Siouxsie and Devoto.

==Personal life==
On 9 September 1981, McGeoch married Janet Pickford, his girlfriend at Manchester Polytechnic, the marriage later ending in divorce. On 14 September 1988, he married Denise Dakin, the second marriage producing a daughter, Emily Jean McGeoch (b. 1989).

==Death==
McGeoch died at the age of 48 in his sleep on 4 March 2004 at his home in Launceston, Cornwall from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

===Tribute===
Banshees&#x27; drummer Budgie wrote a text to honour him on the Siouxsie website, saying: &quot;Without any disrespect to all the other guitarists we have worked with, none had the relaxed mastery and such a depth of expression as John McGeoch. No amount of scrutiny of filmed &#x27;Live&#x27; performance tapes could reveal the subtle economy of technique that made an apparently complex phrase look so deceptively simple. Exasperated guitarists would often comment, &quot;But his hands don’t even move!&quot;

<text>North Nicosia or Northern Nicosia ( ; ) refers to the largest settlement and the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Northern Cyprus. It is the northern part of the divided city of Nicosia, and is governed by the Nicosia Turkish Municipality. , North Nicosia had a population of 61,378 and a metropolitan area with a population of 82,539.

The city is the economic, political and cultural centre of Northern Cyprus, with many shops, restaurants and shopping malls. It is home to a historic walled city, centred on the Sarayönü Square, and a modern metropolitan area, with the Dereboyu region as its centre of business and entertainment. Described as a city with high levels of welfare, it has seen great urban growth and development in the 21st century, including the construction of new highways and high-rises. It hosts a significant number of tourists and a variety of cultural activities, including its international festivals of theatre and music. With a student population over 34,000, North Nicosia is an important centre of education and research and is home to four universities, of which the Near East University is the biggest.

Following the intercommunal violence of the 1960s, the capital of Republic of Cyprus was divided between the island&#x27;s Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in the south and north respectively in 1963. A coup by the Greek military junta in an attempt to unite the island with Greece in 1974 led to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and the international community considers North Nicosia to have been under Turkish occupation since then.

==History==
During the Cyprus crisis of 1963–64, in the aftermath of unilateral constitutional changes by the Greek Cypriots, intercommunal violence broke out. Nicosia was divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot quarters by the Green Line, named after the colour of the pen used by the United Nations officer to draw the line on a map of the city. This resulted in the ceasing of Turkish Cypriot participation in the government, and following more intercommunal violence in 1964, a number of Turkish Cypriots moved to the Turkish quarter of Nicosia, causing serious overcrowding.

On 15 July 1974, there was an attempted coup d&#x27;état led by the Greek military junta to unite the island with Greece. The coup ousted Archbishop Makarios III as President of Cyprus, replacing him with pro-&quot;enosis&quot; nationalist Nikos Sampson. In response to the prospect of &quot;enosis&quot;, on 20 July 1974, the Turkish Army invaded the island, and from then occupied the 37% of the north part of the Republic of Cyprus. The invasion included two phases. The second phase was performed on 14 August 1974, where the Turkish Army advanced their positions, eventually capturing a total of 37% of Cypriot territory, including the northern part of Nicosia and the cities of Kyrenia and Famagusta.

On 23 April 2003, the Ledra Palace crossing was opened through the Green Line, the first time that crossing was allowed since 1974. This was followed by the opening of Ayios Dometios crossing point on 9 May 2003. On 3 April 2008, the Ledra Street crossing was also reopened.

==Administration==

As the capital, North Nicosia is Northern Cyprus&#x27;s political, economic and cultural centre. North Nicosia hosts the ministries of Northern Cyprus. The city is governed by the Nicosia Turkish Municipality, which is recognised by the constitution of the Republic of Cyprus.

The Nicosia Turkish Municipality is headed by the mayor, Mehmet Harmancı from the Communal Democracy Party (TDP). He came to power in the local elections in 2014 with 38% of the popular vote, defeating the candidates of two major parties who were considered to be candidates with the highest chances by the Turkish Cypriot media in a feat that was seen as a major surprise victory. The organisation of the municipality features a 22-member City Council, composed of 8 councillors from the Republican Turkish Party (CTP), 6 from the National Unity Party (UBP), 6 from the Communal Democracy Party, 1 from the Democratic Party (DP-UG) and 1 from the New Cyprus Party (YKP).

=== Quarters ===
Nicosia is divided into several administrative divisions known as &quot;mahalleler&quot; (singular: &quot;mahalle&quot;) or quarters. Each of these quarters are headed by a &quot;muhtar&quot;, who is elected by the residents in local elections. There are 25 quarters within the jurisdiction of the Nicosia Turkish Municipality, of which 12 are in the walled city and 13 are outside, and below is list of them sorted according to population according to the 2011 census:


==Cityscape==

=== The walled city ===


The walled city of Nicosia is very rich in history, culture and architecture. The northern part is richer in historical buildings and cultural works, with its Selimiye quarter retaining its complete historical character and atmosphere. The walled city overall has been declared a protected area by the Turkish Cypriot Department of Antiquities, and 672 buildings and places of historical value have been registered in it.

At the centre of the walled city lies the Atatürk Square, widely known as Sarayönü. The square has been dubbed as &quot;the heart of Nicosia&quot; and historically has been the cultural center of the Turkish Cypriot community, with the visiting Turkish prime ministers having delivered speeches before and during the conflict in Cyprus. It still hosts mass rallies during political campaigns and the headquarters of the National Unity Party. In the middle of the square stands the Venetian Column, known simply as &quot;the Obelisk&quot; (&quot;Dikiltaş&quot;) to the locals and symbolic of the country&#x27;s government. The column was brought from the ancient city of Salamis by the Venetians in 1550. The coats of arms of six Italian noble families still remains at the bottom of the column, even though the statue of the lion on it has been replaced with a copper ball. The square used to be the seat of a Lusignan palace, which was replaced with the present-day law courts by the British government.

The Girne Avenue connects Sarayönü to the Kyrenia Gate and the İnönü Square in front of it. The avenue has been described as &quot;the symbol of the walled city&quot;, and is filled with numerous shops and restaurants. A project is underway to redesign the area with a better infrastructure, visual quality and accessibility.

Near the entrance of the walled city, to the west of the Girne Avenue, lies the Samanbahçe neighbourhood, built in the 19th century by the government, considered to be the first example of social housing in the island. The houses are uniform and contiguous, and in the center of the neighbourhood is a historic fountain. Still a residential area, the neighbourhood is considered to be one of the best representations of the Cypriot culture.

Further south, next to the Ledra Street checkpoint, is the Arasta area. The area was pedestrianised in 2013 and is home to a network of historic shopping streets, reflecting an eastern shopping tradition with food and traditional items. The area is frequented by tourists.

Nearby Büyük Han, the largest caravanserai in the island and considered to be one of the finest buildings in Cyprus, was built in 1572 by the Ottomans. The building has 68 rooms and a small mosque in the middle, and currently functions as a tourist-frequented cultural centre, with souvenir and handicraft shops, cafés with traditional food and cultural activities such as small-scale opera concerts. Just across from the road is the Kumarcılar Hanı (Gamblers&#x27; Inn), built in the 17th century as a typical example of Ottoman trading inns.

Another central point in the walled city is the Selimiye Mosque, originally built as the St. Sophia Cathedral. The mosque is the chief religious centre in Northern Cyprus. It was built between 1209 and 1228 by the Latin Church of Cyprus, in a Gothic style resembling French cathedrals. Its columns are older, from the Roman era, indicating the possible presence of a Byzantine church before its construction. It used to be the place of coronation of Lusignan kings, and was converted to the largest mosque in the island by the Ottomans in 1571. It remains as a chief landmark of the city. Next to the mosque is the Bedesten, a large Greek church in the Byzantine and Gothic styles, built in the 6th and 14th centuries. It was used as a marketplace in the Ottoman era. Today, it is used as a cultural centre where various cultural activities such as concerts and festivals take place. The two buildings overlook a square, named the Selimiye Square, which also hosts cultural activity and occasional dance shows. The Library of Sultan Mahmud II, which hosts manuscripts in Turkish, Arabic and Persian that are over 500 years old and considered fine examples of calligraphy, is also located in the Selimiye Square.

Among the quarters of the old city are Yenicami and Arabahmet. Yenicami hosts the Haydar Pasha Mosque that used to be the second largest church in the city before its conversion by the Ottomans, and with its Gothic architecture, it is home to richly carved doorways. The Arabahmet neighbourhood hosts the Arabahmet Mosque, which was built in 1845.
=== Metropolitan area ===

Outside the walled city, North Nicosia has expanded to become a large city, with an urban area that has absorbed the neighbouring town of Gönyeli and the former village of Hamitköy that is part of the Nicosia Turkish Municipality. The larger North Nicosia metropolitan area by definition includes the Haspolat region which is also considered to be a part of the city proper as it is within the Nicosia Turkish Municipality jurisdiction, the municipality of Alayköy and the village of Kanlıköy under the jurisdiction of Gönyeli, where North Nicosia is projected to grow. The metropolitan area has an area of 165.2 square kilometres.

The quarters of Nicosia outside the walled city are more spacious than the walled city, with wider roads and junctions. These areas are characterised by multi-floor concrete buildings. In the outskirts of the city, a number large and imposing villas have been built that belong to the middle and upper-classes. Upper and middle class Turkish Cypriots have left the walled city to settle in areas such as Küçük Kaymaklı and Hamitköy, which have seen a corresponding boom in economic and commercial activity. As the city started to expand out of the walled city in the first half of the city, large and imposing houses were built in the Köşklüçiftlik and Çağlayan areas, which characterise these central quarters today. The Yenişehir quarter was planned by the British administration in the 1940s in an optimal design to minimise distances and allow healthy social interaction, and the quarter is still considered as a masterpiece of city planning in Cyprus.

==Demographics==
North Nicosia is mainly inhabited by Turkish Cypriots and Turkish settlers (including migrant workers). Turkish settlers make up the majority of the population in the walled city, while Turkish Cypriots predominantly inhabit the areas of the city outside the walls. Turkish Cypriots follow a more secularised lifestyle than the more conservative settlers, leading to tension between the communities. However, in the 2010s, a significant number of settled workers in the walled city left Northern Cyprus.

Historically, Turkish Cypriots had concentrated to the north of the riverbed and Greek Cypriots to the south. The Green Line was drawn to separate the Turkish quarters of the city from the Greek quarters, and 7000 Turkish Cypriots, around 30% of the Turkish population of Greater Nicosia, were displaced from quarters of the walled city and some suburbs such as Küçük Kaymaklı/Omorphita. North Nicosia also received a great number of displaced Turkish Cypriots from surrounding villages. The Göçmenköy quarter (literally meaning &quot;village of the displaced&quot;) was founded to resettle these displaced people. The Arab Ahmet quarter had had an Armenian Cypriot presence since the Ottoman conquest; having been a minority until the 1920s, they constituted the overwhelming majority of the area by the 1950s. 200 Armenians from Arab Ahmet, Köşklüçiftlik and Kumsal fled the quarter during the inter-communal violence of 1963. Greek Cypriots fled from the Ayluka/Ayios Loukas quarter in 1963, and from the Trachones/Kızılbaş and Küçük Kaymaklı/Omorphita quarters in 1974. The number of Greek Cypriots displaced from these quarters in 1974 was around 4700.

== Economy ==
North Nicosia is the financial and economic centre of Northern Cyprus. In 2012, Lefkoşa District had 39.9% of the workplaces and 49.5% of the employees in Northern Cyprus. The Central Bank of Northern Cyprus is located on the Bedrettin Demirel Avenue. The city has seen great urban growth in the last decades, but the authorities have been criticised over the lack of city planning. Between 2008 and 2010, the construction rates in the North Nicosia urban area grew by 23.9%, with the largest boom observed in the construction of new industrial facilities in the city, which grew by 87.5% over two years. North Nicosia also grew in importance as a centre of commerce as the construction of offices grew by 74.2%. Recently, programmes have been put to place to regulate the growth of the city that has expanded uncontrollably. North Nicosia has been identified as a city with a high amount of development and welfare.

One aspect of North Nicosia that gives it the advantage for economical growth is its central position in Northern Cyprus, where transport links from Kyrenia, Famagusta and Morphou intersect. North Nicosia is home to the Nicosia International Fair and an Organised Industrial Area, where many businesses and manufacturers are located. Their location, along with other facilities such as the large sports complex, were chosen to be on the connection between the highways linking Morphou to Famagusta. North Nicosia hugely influences the economy of the surrounding district, as far as the Ercan International Airport, along with Dikomo in the Girne District.

The economy in the walled city has stagnated through the 2000s and 2010s, with the central Municipal Market losing its popularity, even though it has started to receive investment and programs have been put to place to reinvigorate the region with cultural activities being organised. In 2014, the Arasta shopping region close to the Ledra Street crossing was pedestrianised, which increased the popularity of the area.

Tourism is an important sector of the economy. In 2012, North Nicosia hosted more than 146,000 tourists, accounting for 13.8% of the total touristic stays in Northern Cyprus. In 2008, after the opening of the Ledra Street crossing, the Arasta area saw an influx of visitors as around 2300 Greek Cypriots and tourists used the crossing to cross into the area daily. The city has seen the construction of large hotels in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The constructions have changed the city&#x27;s skyline, with the newly constructed Merit Hotel on the Bedrettin Demirel Avenue and the Golden Tulip Hotel in the Dereboyu region being highly visible high-rises. The country&#x27;s oldest hotel, the Saray Hotel was also renovated and each of the three hotels has its own casino, with a total capacity of around 700 people.

The city saw around 117 million Turkish liras of new construction in the year 2011 alone. In this year, a large amount of construction of dwellings was observed especially in the Hamitköy area and Gönyeli, which is part of the Nicosia urban area, but also in the regions of Küçük Kaymaklı and Aydemet region, indicating a residential growth in these areas.

== Culture ==

North Nicosia is home to cultural diversity. Students from different backgrounds in the universities celebrate their national festivals with activities, at which their national dances and traditions are performed. Different religious groups conduct cultural activities; the Alevi Cultural Association is headquartered in Nicosia.

=== Popular culture ===

The Near East University annually holds a spring fest, during which famous Turkish Cypriot, Turkish and international singers and bands perform, dance festivals, sports and board game competitions are held. In 2014, the university built the Park Near East on an area of 220,000 square metres, and the concerts of Deep Purple and Turkish bands such as Yüksek Sadakat drew tens of thousands of spectators from Cyprus and Turkey. During the festival, the Moscow State Ballet also performed in the university. It also hosts the annual Rock &#x27;n Cyprus festival, at which bands from Turkey perform, and organises the NEU Nicosia Carnival at the Dereboyu region of the city, at which the students display their culture and the locals crowd into the streets.

The city has hosted other musical organisations, such as the Shark Virgin Island Festival, which is the greatest electronic music organisation in the island. The Dereboyu region has become a centre of entertainment, where street parties, festivals and concerts of local bands and singers take place. The walled city has also seen investment in the recent years, with cultural centres and bars being opened. To reinvigorate the region, monthly street parties are organised.

=== Fine arts ===
The city has fine arts institutions at university levels, with the fine arts faculties of the Near East University and Cyprus International University. The universities contribute to the artistic culture of the city by participating in exhibitions and competitions, and students are involved in creating artistic depictions of Nicosia. In 2014, an arts and culture centre in the Arabahmet region was reopened with the contribution of the Girne American University. In 2013, a new exhibition hall was unveiled in the Near East University, whose students participate in organisations abroad.

Photography exhibitions and competitions take place in the city, organised by the state and private institutions alike. Traditional handicrafts are also actively practised, with exhibitions taking place.

=== Museums ===

The city is home to a number of museums. The Dervish Pasha Mansion is similar in architecture to the Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion, reflecting typical late Ottoman urban architecture, and functions as an ethnographic museum today. It hosts artefacts relating to the Ottoman era and the archaeological history of Cyprus. Another example of a house preserved as such is the Lusignan House, reflecting the architecture of the Lusignan era and the Gothic style, and is furnished with Lusignan and Ottoman items.

The Mevlevi Tekke Museum used to be the headquarters of the Mevlevi sect, associated with the Whirling Dervishes. It was designed for purposes that are similar to monasteries, and now functions as an ethnographic museum as well, reflecting the rites of the sect.

The Lapidary Museum was originally built as a guesthouse for the pilgrims visiting the St. Sophia Cathedral (now the Selimiye Mosque). It hosts a collection of architectural artefacts and antiquities that have been excavated.

The Near East University campus is also home to three museums: the Communications Museum, the Art Museum and the Classical Cars Museum.

=== Performing arts ===
The Turkish Cypriot State Theatre and Nicosia Municipal Theater are headquartered in Nicosia and put on a number of plays each year. The Nicosia Turkish Municipality organises the Cyprus Theatre Festival annually, and prominent theatrical groups from Turkey as well as the Nicosia Municipal Theatre participate in the festival that takes place in the Atatürk Culture and Congress Centre of the Near East University. Theatre is very popular in Northern Cyprus, and as such, long queues form for the ticket sales of the festival, with the number of theatre-goers increasing every year. The Nicosia Municipal Theatre children as well and the Gönyeli municipality holds its own theatre workshop that puts on plays. Nicosia Artistic Theatre is another theatrical group that is active in the city.

Nicosia Turkish Municipality founded its Lefkoşa Municipal Orchestra in 1987. Since then, the orchestra has grown and developed several branches, including the Children&#x27;s Choir, Folk Music Choir, Pop Orchestra, Latin Orchestra and the Chamber Music Orchestra, with about 90 participants, most of whom are volunteers. The orchestra frequently delivers concerts and participates in big musical festivals held in the country. At times, the orchestra delivers concerts at open spaces, such as parks and squares. It also holds composing contests. The Presidential Symphony Orchestra of Northern Cyprus, founded in 2015, is based in North Nicosia and as of 2018, the works for building a concert hall and headquarters for the orchestra are underway. The city is home to the annual Nicosia Walled City Jazz Festival, at which both local and Turkish jazz musicians take the stage.

The city hosts several folk dance groups, which organise annual festivals to perform Cypriot folk dances. The foreign students or delegations visiting universities perform their own traditional dances. The city hosts folk dance shows of children from other countries in the annual children&#x27;s day on 23 April. North Nicosia annually hosts the Nicosia International Folk Dance Festival, where groups from various countries perform all around the city in parks and squares.

Several modern dance activities also take place in the city, where several dance schools are established. Internationally renowned musicals and dance shows are performed in front of crowded audiences in the Atatürk Culture and Congress Centre. In 2010, the city was part of the international Earthdance activity, which was witnessed by thousands of locals.

==Education==
Nicosia is the seat of four Turkish Cypriot universities, namely the Near East University (NEU), Cyprus International University (CIU), University of Mediterranean Karpasia and the American University of Cyprus. It also hosts a campus of the Turkish Anadolu University, along with two vocational schools (Atatürk Academy of Teachers and the Police Academy) that are equivalent to universities. As of the 2014–2015 educational year, North Nicosia was home to a student population of over 34,000; Near East University is the largest university in Northern Cyprus with 25,068 students; Cyprus International University has 8324 students and the University of Mediterranean Karpasia has 632. The universities are home to great diversity, with the Near East University and Cyprus International University having students from 96 and 64 countries respectively.

The Near East University was founded in 1988 and its campus is a few kilometres away from Nicosia proper. The Cyprus International University followed in 1997 with a campus that is located at the Haspolat region, outside the proper city of Nicosia. The University of Mediterranean Karpasia was founded in 2011, and is located at a building in the Küçük Kaymaklı region, within the city of Nicosia.

The Near East University owns a supercomputer that ranks the 13th in the world and the first in the region in terms of computation speed and capacity, used to help universities from Turkey in their research along with the university itself, and has participated in the Large Hadron Collider experiment at CERN, as well as Ebola virus disease treatment research. The NEU has also locally developed and manufactured a completely solar energy-powered car and has research centers in topics ranging from tissue engineering to history. The Cyprus International University is home to eight research centers. Examples of research conducted include excavations that have uncovered the earliest human bones that have ever been found in Cyprus and possible devices that could be implanted on the human body to facilitate communication.

The Grand Library of the Near East University is home to over 1 million printed and 150 million electronic resources and is visited by more than 7000 people daily, and agreements have been signed to share these resources with Turkish institutions.

In the North Nicosia urban area there are 21 state-owned institutions that offer primary education, along with three special institutions for children with disabilities. The city hosts three kinds of high schools: state-owned highschools (lise) that teach in Turkish, state-owned &quot;colleges&quot; (kolej) that teach in English and private high schools. The Türk Maarif Koleji is a state-owned high school with over 1000 students that teaches in English, was established in 1964 and prepares students for the British educational system. The private high schools in Nicosia are the Near East College, the Levent College and the TED College. There are also the state-owned Anadolu High School of Fine Arts and four vocational high schools.

==Transport==

North Nicosia is a major transport hub in Northern Cyprus, where the highways from the other major cities of Northern Cyprus, Famagusta, Kyrenia and Morphou intersect. It is connected to the other cities with modern, four-lane highways: the D-30 highway from Morphou to Famagusta passes through Nicosia, D-25 to Kyrenia. Ercan International Airport has been used for international flights. There is no train or metro system nor plans to develop one. In 2011, plans to build a tram system were put forward but rejected, yet the popular opinion is strongly in favour of establishing one.

North Nicosia has seen the construction of new highways and roads recently to solve its traffic problem, including the construction of two ringroads in the 2010s. One of these links the Metehan area and indirectly the Dereboyu region to Alayköy and indirectly the highway to Morphou, and was completed and opened to public traffic in 2014. The other one, the Nicosia Northern Ringroad, is currently under construction and will connect D-30 from Famagusta to Morphou directly to D-25 from Kyrenia, preventing the entry of vehicles from Kyrenia going to the airport and from Famagusta to Kyrenia, Gönyeli or Morphou into the city. While the construction stalled for a time due to land disputes, the work on the project recommenced in 2018.

The company of LETTAŞ provides bus services in North Nicosia. Buses are the only form of public transport available, and the system is considered unreliable due to the unplanned city growth, resulting in private cars being the primary means of transport. There is a bus terminal in the region of Yenişehir. The walled city has been facilitated to be easily navigable on foot, but the municipality has been criticised over the lack of a reliable system of public transport.

A bicycle-sharing system called Velespeed was introduced by the municipality in 2018. The system consists of 410 bicycles and stations for rental or drop-off placed across the city, within 15 minutes of cycling distance of one another.

== Sports ==
North Nicosia hosts five out of the fourteen teams of the Turkish Cypriot Süper Lig, the top football division in Northern Cyprus: Çetinkaya, Yenicami, Küçük Kaymaklı, Gönyeli and Gençlik Gücü. Çetinkaya is the most successful Turkish Cypriot team with 14 titles, and teams from Nicosia have won the majority of the trophies in the league. Çetinkaya is also the oldest member of the league, founded in 1930, and holds the distinction of having won the united Cypriot league prior to the division. There is also a large following of Turkish football teams in the city, with celebrations in the Dereboyu area for their victories.

The city annually hosts the Nicosia Marathon, to which over a thousand people participated in 2014, including leading political figures. The marathon passes through the city&#x27;s popular avenues and landmarks with the categories of 4, 8 and 21 kilometres, the 4 km being regarded as a public walk. Among the other sports events in the city is the Lefkoşa Open tennis tournament. Lefkoşa Beach Volley Arena located in the city hosts the annual Zafer Beach Volleyball Cup that are part of the Turkish national cup. In 2015, the city hosted the first Nicosia Youth and Sports Festival, encompassing a number of sports activities from 22 sports, including a street basketball event, tennis, handball, shooting, boxing and table tennis tournaments.

North Nicosia is home to several sports venues. The center of sports in the city is considered to be the Atatürk Sports Complex, home of the Nicosia Atatürk Stadium, which is the biggest stadium in the island with a capacity of 28,000 people. The stadium is the home of Çetinkaya and Yenicami. The sports complex also hosts the Atatürk Sports Hall, which functions as an arena for basketball, volleyball and handball, the Atatürk Indoor Swimming Pool, where popular swimming competitions are held with Turkish teams also participating, tennis courts and headquarters of the Turkish Cypriots sports federations of several branches. The complex also hosts an athlete training facility, and is accessible to disabled athletes. The Nicosia Turkish Municipality is active in terms of building new sports facilities and has done so in the Metehan area, with projects underway in the Hamitköy and Haspolat regions.

North Nicosia has hosted international sports organisations. It hosted the 9th Global Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championship in 2013 and the Economic Cooperation Organization University Games in 2013. Its prospects of hosting and participating in many international tournaments are hindered by an international sports embargo. It was also part of the annual Cyprus Rally in 2014, which garnered huge popular attention and attracted crowds.

The universities contribute significantly to the sports life of North Nicosia. The Near East University has the only Olympic pool in the island with an area of 2700 square meters, and over 12000 people have attended swimming courses in the pool. It also has a modern sports hall and a health and wellness campus covering more than 2000 square meters. Its synchronised swimming team carries out regular performances and is active in several branches. The CIU Arena of the Cyprus International University has a total area of 22,500 square metres and is the biggest integrated sports complex in Northern Cyprus. It hosts an indoor sports hall, an indoor swimming pool, tennis courts and other facilities from a beach handball arena to a climbing wall. It also has the CIU Foxes teams, whose men&#x27;s handball branch won the national league two times in a row.

<doc id="1193966" wikidata="Q818600" url="?curid=1193966" title="Order of the Rising Sun">
<text>The is a Japanese order, established in 1875 by Emperor Meiji. The Order was the first national decoration awarded by the Japanese government, created on 10 April 1875 by decree of the Council of State. The badge features rays of sunlight from the rising sun. The design of the Rising Sun symbolizes energy as powerful as the rising sun in parallel with the &quot;rising sun&quot; concept of Japan (&quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;).

The Order of the Rising Sun is awarded to people who have rendered distinguished service to the state in various fields except military service. Since there is no order for military achievements under the current Japanese system, Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel are awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure for their long engagement in public service. Prior to the end of World War II, it was also awarded for exemplary military service. In 2003, the 7th and 8th Class, which were at the bottom of the Order of the Rising Sun, were abolished, and the upper half of the 1st Class (勲一等, &quot;Kun-ittō&quot;) was separated as the Order of the Paulownia Flowers, which was higher than the Order of the Rising Sun.

Until 2003, the Order of the Rising Sun was on the same rank as the Order of the Precious Crown, with the Order of the Rising Sun being for men only and the Order of the Precious Crown for women only. The Order of the Sacred Treasure was treated as an order of slightly lower rank than the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Precious Crown. For example, the 1st class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure was placed between the 1st class and the 2nd class of the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Precious Crown, and the 2nd class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure was placed between the 2nd class and the 3rd class of the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Precious Crown.

Since 2003, the Order of the Rising Sun has been awarded not only to men but also to women, and the Order of the Precious Crown has become a special order given only to female members of the imperial family in Japan and female members of royal families in foreign countries, only when it is specifically necessary for diplomatic ceremonies. The Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasure became the same rank of orders, and one of them came to be awarded because of the difference in the nature of the contribution to the state. The Order of the Rising Sun is awarded with an emphasis on achievements to the state, and the Order of the Sacred Treasure is awarded with an emphasis on long-term public service.

While it is the third highest order bestowed by the Japanese government, it is however generally the highest ordinarily conferred order. The highest Japanese order, the Order of the Chrysanthemum, is reserved for heads of state or royalty, while the second highest order, the Order of the Paulownia Flowers, is mostly reserved for politicians.

The modern version of this honour has been conferred on non-Japanese recipients beginning in 1981 (although several foreigners were given the honor before World War II). The awarding of the Order is administered by the Decoration Bureau of the Cabinet Office headed by the Japanese prime minister. It is awarded in the name of the emperor and can be awarded posthumously.

Since 2003, the number representing rank included in the official name of the order was removed. As a result, although numbers representing ranks were sometimes used in common names, the formal names such as 勲一等 (&quot;Kun-ittō&quot;, First Class) and 勲二等 (&quot;Kun-nitō&quot;, Second Class) were no longer used.

== Criteria for awarding ==

Among them, regulations on the criteria for awarding orders to those who belong to the National Diet, the central and local governments, and courts stipulate in detail which ranks are awarded for each position. For example, the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class) is awarded to a person who has made outstanding achievements in his/her position as Prime Minister, Speaker of the House of Representatives, President of the House of Councillors, or Chief Justice of Japan. The Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class) or the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays (2nd class) are awarded to a person who has made outstanding achievements in his/her position as Minister of State, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary, Senior Vice-Minister, Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives, Vice President of the House of Councilors, or Judge of the Supreme Court.

== Classes ==
The Order was awarded in nine classes until 2003, when the Grand Cordon with Paulownia Flowers was made a separate order, and the lowest two classes were abolished. Since then, it has been awarded in six classes. Conventionally, a diploma is prepared to accompany the insignia of the order, and in some rare instances, the personal signature of the Emperor will have been added. As an illustration of the wording of the text, a translation of a representative 1929 diploma says:
== Insignia ==
The &quot;star&quot; for the &quot;Grand Cordon&quot; and &quot;Second Class&quot; is a silver star of eight points, each point having three alternating silver rays; the central emblem is identical to the badge. It is worn on the left chest for the Grand Cordon, on the right chest for the 2nd Class.

The &quot;badge&quot; for the &quot;Grand Cordon to Sixth Classes&quot; is an eight-pointed badge bearing a central red enamelled sun disc, with gilt points (1st–4th Classes), with four gilt and four silver points (5th Class), or with silver points (6th Class); each point comprises three white enamelled rays. It is suspended from three enamelled paulownia leaves (not chrysanthemum leaves as the Decoration Bureau page claims) on a ribbon in white with red border stripes, worn as a sash from the right shoulder for the Grand Cordon, as a necklet for the 2nd and 3rd Classes and on the left chest for the 4th to 6th Classes (with a rosette for the 4th Class).

The &quot;badge&quot; for the &quot;Seventh and Eighth Classes&quot; consisted of a silver medal in the shape of three paulownia leaves, enamelled for the 7th Class and plain for the 8th Class. Both were suspended on a ribbon, again in white with red border stripes, and worn on the left chest. Both classes were abolished in 2003 and replaced by the Order of the Paulownia Flowers, a single-class order that now ranks above the Order of the Rising Sun.

<text>Mahatma Ayyankali (മഹാത്മ അയ്യൻകാളി; 28 August 1863 – 18 June 1941) was an Indian politician, prominent social reformer, educator, economist, lawmaker, and revolutionary leader. He worked for the advancement of the oppressed people in the princely state of Travancore. His struggle resulted in many changes that improved the socio-political structure of Kerala. His determined and relentless efforts changed the lives of Dalits. He is known as the King of Pulaya.
==Background==

Ayyankali was born on 28 August 1863 in Venganoor, Thiruvananthapuram, Travancore. He was the first of eight children born to Ayyan and Mala, who were members of the Pulayar community. The family led a marginally better life compared to other Pulayars as they were given of land by the landlord with whom Ayyan was an &quot;Adiyalan&quot; (slave) spending all his time serving the Janmi or Zamindar (feudal landlord). 
Members of the Pulayar community generally worked as bonded labor to the Janmis during this time and did not have the right to own land or even enter temples to pray.

The region in which Ayyankali lived, which now forms a part of the state of Kerala, was particularly affected by social divisions during his lifetime and was described as a &quot;mad house&quot; of castes. The Pulayars were regarded as the slaves of the agrarian society in the kingdom and they suffered greatly from oppressive discrimination, particularly from the landowning castes including the Nair caste.

Suffering from this social injustice caused Ayyankali to join his Pulayar friends who gathered at the end of their workday to sing and dance to folk music that protested the situation. 

Some joined him in forming a group that challenged the members of the oppressor castes sometimes leading to physical fights. His popularity earned him the names of &quot;Urpillai&quot; and &quot;Moothapullai&quot; translated roughly as &#x27;Leader of the Land&#x27; or &#x27;Elder Leader&#x27;.

Ayyankali married Chellamma in 1888. The couple had seven children.

==Campaigning==
===Freedom of movement===
In 1893, Ayyankali, dressed in clothing traditionally associated with oppressor caste people, and defied the social conventions that applied to oppressed people by riding on a road in a bullock cart he had bought. Both the act of purchase and that of traveling on a road that was traditionally the domain of the upper castes were daring acts. In a similar act of defiance, he entered the marketplace at Nedumangad. These protests, which have been described by Nisar and Kanadasamy as &quot;laying claim to the public space&quot;, strengthened the resolve of others from the oppressed communities of Travancore to shake off the shackles of social oppression, leading to further acts of protest elsewhere, such as in Kazhakkoottam. The outcome of the continued protest marches, which sometimes turned violent, became known as Chaliyar riots. By 1900, the Pulayars gained the right to use most roads in the state, although they were still barred from roads that led to Hindu temples.

Later, in 1904, Ayyankali was inspired by the speech of the reformist Ayyavu Swamikal. He had been preaching the need to break caste divisions because he thought that doing so would limit the number of people who were converting from Hinduism to Christianity. A branch of Swamikal&#x27;s Brahma Nishta Matam, an organisation, was established in that year by Ayyankali and some friends in Venganoor. Ayyankali also drew inspiration from the activities of Narayana Guru, a contemporary social reformer from the Ezhava caste, although the two men differed in their philosophy and the means of turning it into reality. The Ezhava and Pulayar communities did ally occasionally with each other on occasions, one of which was the campaign to gain access to the Hindu temple in Vaikom.

===Education===

Ayyankali also sought to improve access to education for the oppressed classes. A few Pulayars had gained access to schools set up by the Colonial Missionary Society and London Missionary Society from around the mid-nineteenth century. Conversion to Christianity was a prerequisite for attendance at such schools, and there were cases where Pulayars offered to contribute to the cost of supplying teachers for them. However, Ayyankali, who was illiterate, believed that education should be available to all children and this meant that government schools should allow access to untouchables.

The government was already attempting to modernize its approach to social welfare. Several public schools were opened for &quot;untouchable&quot; communities after 1895 but the right to primary education was limited in scope. State funding of education became effective in 1904 but even after the government ordered schools to admit children &quot;untouchable&quot; castes in 1907, local officials found ways to refuse it. In that year, helped by the experience gained from organizing the Brahma Nishta Mattam, Ayyankali founded the Sadhu Jana Paripalana Sangham (SJPS) (Association for the Protection of the Poor) which campaigned for access to schools and raised funds to set up Pulayar-operated schools in the interim. This attracted support from both Hindus and Christians.

An attempt by Ayyankali to enroll a Pulayar girl in a government school led to violent acts perpetrated by oppressor castes against the community and eventually to the burning down of the school building in the village of Ooruttambalam. His response was an organized strike of agricultural labor, a first strike action by oppressed agricultural laborers of the region. They withdrew from the paddy fields owned by the oppressor castes until the government acceded to their demand for removing restrictions based on caste to education.

Ayyankali was also central to the success of the Pulaya challenge against the traditional strictures that prohibited females of the community from covering their upper body in the public. The oppressor caste Hindus had insisted the custom was necessary to distinguish the low status of untouchable people. During the 19th century, this belief came under increasing attack from various untouchable groups and Christian missionaries. The Channar revolt helped the Nadar people to not follow the practice before Ayyankali&#x27;s birth. However, this revolt did not do anything for the Pulaya self-dignity to cover themselves until 1915–16.

===Representation===
Ayyankali later became a member of the assembly of Travancore, known as the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly (SMPA) or Praja Sabha.

==Public acceptance, honors and veneration==
In 2002, Ayyanakali was commemorated on an Indian postage stamp.

The historian P. Sanal Mohan has described Ayyankali as &quot;the most important leader of modern Kerala&quot;. He is also known as the Kerala Spartacus. The anniversary of Ayyankali&#x27;s birth has been celebrated by his descendants and by special interest groups.

<text>Naked Empire is the eighth book in Terry Goodkind&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth.&quot;

==Plot introduction==
This book opens with Richard and Kahlan still in the Old World traveling back to the New World. A new character, Owen, pleads for Richard and Kahlan&#x27;s help in freeing his people from the hands of the Imperial Order. They are set upon by a seemingly mysterious dust storm that holds the silhouette of a man. They are sent a warning letter by Nicci, but before they are able to finish reading the letter they are set upon by Imperial Order mercenaries. After learning that Richard has been poisoned by Owen, they must travel back deeper into the Old World to the Bandakar. They find an ancient boundary protecting the Bandakar Empire from outside invaders came down two years past and now the Imperial Order has occupied this nation of frail-minded people. Soon Richard and Kahlan learn of a new monster that was created by Jagang&#x27;s Sisters of the Dark.

==Plot summary==
Richard, Kahlan, Cara, Jennsen, Friedrich and Tom are in the Old World, near the Pillars of Creation. They are trying to determine the meaning of a small statue resembling Kahlan. Cara had touched it and it activated like a sand hourglass. Richard notices some ravens and suspects that the birds are tracking them somehow. In the middle of the night, a shadow of a man could be seen with the ravens, his outline betrayed by the swirling sand and grit. Richard also discovers the existence of a boundary, recently destroyed, similar to the ones placed between Westland, the Midlands, and D&#x27;Hara, although he could not fathom why it existed. Richard&#x27;s gift is giving him headaches again, but they&#x27;re different from before. As they continue to travel, they cross paths with a young man named Owen who recognizes Richard as the Lord Rahl and begs Richard to help save his people from the Order, as his own people are too enlightened to perform violent deeds. With other trouble on his mind, Richard refuses and sends Owen away. Richard begins to notice a problem with the Sword of Truth, as well as his magic. Furthermore, he starts developing a fever and a chill. Nicci sends a letter in warning, but it is destroyed by the Imperial Order before they could finish reading it.

Meanwhile, Zedd and Adie are back at the Wizard&#x27;s Keep to defend it against Emperor Jagang&#x27;s Sorceresses. However, they are overwhelmed by intruders who enter the Keep, unaffected by any of the protection spells placed. A sister enters the Keep after Zedd and Adie are tied up and Rada&#x27;Hans are placed around their necks. 
Richard was poisoned by Owen, a man from the Bandakar Empire, in order to force Richard to save the Bandakar people from the Order. Like Jennsen, Owen is pristinely ungifted, meaning immune and invisible to magic. Arriving in the Bandakar lands, he finds them stunted intellectually and culturally, embracing a philosophy of aggressive passivity, allowing themselves to be dominated entirely by the Order. Given their complete lack of ability to do violence, Owen brought Richard, believing he could drive the Order away. Richard discovers that the Bandakar are the long lost descendants of the House of Rahl&#x27;s pristinely ungifted children, banished across the boundaries to the Old World three thousand years ago. Once in the Old World, a great wizard then placed them in isolation to prevent their ideas from infecting the rest of the world. Using the Bandakar as hostages, Jagang sent them into the Wizard&#x27;s Keep to rob it, as the pristinely ungifted Bandakar were totally immune to magic.

Richard demands to meet their leader and is shocked to discover that the Wise One is merely a blindfolded child indoctrinated in their beliefs, as they believed that innocent children could not lead them astray. After proving through debate that this is nonsensical, Richard is nearly killed by a Bandakar still dedicated to their passive beliefs, and the horrified Bandakar realize that despite their ideology, they are also capable of violence. After raising an ad hoc army from the newly converted Bandakar, Richard kills Nicholas the Slide, the creature created by the Sisters of the Dark, by tricking Nicholas into leaving his body vulnerable.

==Characters==
==Wizard&#x27;s Eighth Rule==
The Wizard&#x27;s Eighth Rule, revealed in &quot;Naked Empire&quot;, is:

It is explained in the novel as follows: &quot;Be justified in your convictions. Be completely committed. Earn what you want and need rather than waiting for others to give you what you desire.&quot;

<doc id="1193984" wikidata="Q91648" url="?curid=1193984" title="Ott-Heinrich Keller">
<text>Eduard Ott-Heinrich Keller (22 June 1906 in Frankfurt – 5 December 1990 in Halle) was a German mathematician who worked in the fields of geometry, topology and algebraic geometry. He formulated the celebrated problem which is now called the Jacobian conjecture in 1939.

He was born in Frankfurt–am-Main, and studied at the universities of Frankfurt, Vienna, Berlin and Göttingen. As a student of Max Dehn he wrote a dissertation on the tiling of space with cubes. This led to another &#x27;Keller conjecture&#x27;: the Keller cube-tiling conjecture from 1930.

Subsequently he worked with Georg Hamel in Berlin, habilitating in 1933 with a thesis on Cremona transformations. The Jacobian conjecture is quite naturally posed in that setting. The motivation for looking at rather general polynomial transformations, say of the projective plane, came from the singularity theory for algebraic curves.

During World War II he taught in a naval college in Flensburg. After the war he had several positions, and was appointed a professor at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in 1952, as successor of H. W. E. Jung.

<text>Proctor Academy is a coeducational, independent preparatory boarding school for grades 9–12 located on in Andover, New Hampshire. The school was established in 1848 by the town of Andover, with Dyer H. Sanborn as the principal. There are about 370 students.

==History==

===Origin===
Proctor Academy first began as Andover Academy, established in 1848 by the town of Andover. The idea of the school spawned from a sewing group conversation between the wives of the area&#x27;s prominent families, in the living room of attorney Samuel Butterfield. The women shared a strong conviction that their town needed a school for its expanding population. On June 23, 1848, the incorporation of the academy was approved, with Samuel Butterfield as president, Walcott Hamlin as secretary, and True Brown and John Fellows as executive committee members.

The academy opened its doors in August 1848, on the second floor of the church on Main Street, with many of the desks, chairs and chalkboards donated by the Butterfields. Mrs. Eliza Butterfield set up the curriculum with Dyer H. Sanborn as the principal and Miss Eliza Wingate as &quot;preceptress&quot;. The first term had 43 girls and 65 boys enrolled, but within four years the school had grown to just over 250 students.

===1850–1900===
Principal Sanborn (1850–1851) was very popular with the students, and the school thrived through its first couple of years with funding from generous patrons. After two years, Sanborn stepped down, and Moses Leland Morse of Bowdoin College took over for the next two years as principal. Under Morse, the student body more than doubled, as chemistry was added to the curriculum and the guaranty fund reached $3,000. Woodbury Langdon, Luther Puffer (law student), and John Simonds were some of the first graduates to go on to college. After Principal Morse stepped down, Thaddeus W. Bruce (1852–1853) of Dartmouth College took the helm with Miss Marcia Foster as assistant (who later married). Around this time future world-renowned artist David Dalhoff Neal also attended classes. George Dustan took over as principal in 1854 when the school fell victim to a smallpox outbreak, in which one of the teachers and a former student died.

The smallpox epidemic in 1854-1855 forced the school to close, and for the next three decades the school struggled with its identity and funding. In 1857, the school reopened its doors as the New England Christian Literary and Biblical Institute, then again in 1860 as the Andover Christian Institute. In 1865, the school was closed and reopened in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, as the Wolfeboro Christian Institute.

As the school struggled, former Andover resident John Proctor, the inventor of the threaded wood screw, returned, in 1857, to build up the town. By the 1870s Proctor helped to return the school to Andover, debt-free, as well as build a new dormitory on the site of modern-day Gannett House. In 1879, the Unitarian Church sought to purchase the Andover school in order to create a school &quot;free from...theological dogmatizing and unnatural religious methods.&quot; Andover was a hotbed of Unitarian thought, which helped to facilitate the sale of the school. In 1881, the school was opened as Proctor Academy in honor of John Proctor&#x27;s contributions to the school.

===The 1930s and 1940s===

Not realizing the severity of the economic downturn, in 1932 the trustees of the school invested $45,000 to build Maxwell Savage Hall. At the first assembly of the 1935 school year, Headmaster Carl Wetherell announced that he was quitting due to the poor outlook for the school. A search for a replacement was hurriedly started. John Halsey Gulick took the job, and immediately instituted sweeping reforms of the school, creating mechanical arts programs such as boat building, wood shop, and machine shop. Students were involved in the upkeep and improvement of the school, clearing the land for the school&#x27;s first ski area, Slalom Hill, as well as a farm which was used to feed the community.

===The 1950s and 1960s===
Lyle Farrell—a 1929 graduate of the University of New Hampshire and captain of the 1928 Wildcats football team—who started teaching at Proctor in the 1930s, took over as Headmaster of the school in 1952. During his time as Headmaster, he pushed for the expansion of the school, leading to the construction of Holland Auditorium, Shirley Hall, Farrell Field House, Leonard Field, Farrell Field and the Blackwater Ski Area. Farrell also established the learning skills programs for college-bound students with dyslexia.

===The 1970s to 1980s===
In 1971, David Fowler succeeded Lyle Farrell as Headmaster. He instituted a democratic student government, rather than a seniority system. Realizing the unique location and programs that Proctor offered, they created a wilderness orientation program for new students, which still exists today. In 1974, the mountain classroom program was created, combining an Outward Bound type of small group outdoor experience with specialized academic sessions. By 1975, Proctor had faculty and facilities in Madrid, Spain, and Clermont-Ferrand, France, which led to later experiential education programs in Segovia, Spain, and Pont-l&#x27;Abbé, France. European Classroom, an art and French language program, was created in 2011, replacing the France program.

==Campus==
Proctor Academy is located on in the town of Andover, New Hampshire. The property is a state-certified tree farm.

One of the newest additions to the campus, Peabody House, was completed in 2008 on the former site of Morton House, which was torn down in August 2007.

<text>The decision analysis (DA) cycle is the top-level procedure for carrying out a decision analysis. Decision analysis (DA) is the discipline comprising the philosophy, methodology, and professional practice necessary to address important decisions in a formal manner.

The traditional decision analysis cycle consists of four phases:
*basis development
*deterministic sensitivity analysis
*probabilistic analysis
*basis appraisal.

The diagram below depicts the decision analysis cycle:

A revised form of the cycle consists of an attention-focusing method followed by a decision method, each of which is composed of three stages:
*formulation
*evaluation
*appraisal.

<doc id="1194026" wikidata="Q417437" url="?curid=1194026" title="Pentaborane(9)">
<text>Pentaborane(9) is an inorganic compound with the formula . It is one of the most common boron hydride clusters, although it is a highly reactive compound. Because of its high reactivity with oxygen, it was once evaluated as rocket or jet fuel. Like many of the smaller boron hydrides, pentaborane is colourless, diamagnetic, and volatile. It is related to pentaborane(11) ().

==Structure, synthesis, properties==
Its structure is that of five atoms of boron arranged in a square pyramid. Each boron has a terminal hydride ligand and four hydrides span the edges of the base of the pyramid. It is classified as a nido cage.

It was first prepared by Alfred Stock by pyrolysis of diborane at about 200 °C. An improved synthesis starts from salts of octahydrotriborate (), which is converted to the bromide using HBr. Pyrolysis of this bromide gives pentaborane. 
In the U.S., pentaborane was produced on a commercial scale by Callery Chemical Company.

Above 150 °C, it decomposes, producing hydrogen. Unlike diborane, It is quite stable at room temperature if stored properly. It is much more stable in presence of water than diborane.

Pentaborane is a highly polar compound, with a dipole moment of 2.13 D. It is soluble in hydrocarbons like benzene, and cyclohexane, and in greases including those used in lab equipment. 

==Reactions==
The chemistry of pentaborane is extensive. Halogenation give the symmetrical derivatives , which can be isomerised to place the halide on the base of the square pyramid. With strong bases such as alkyl lithium reagents, it can be deprotonated and the resulting lithium salts react with diverse electrophiles to give substituted derivatives. It is Lewis acidic, forming double adducts with two equivalents of trimethylphosphine. Pentaborane is used for the synthesis of other boron hydride clusters. It is also a precursor to metallaboranes. For example, it reacts with diiron nonacarbonyl to give .

==History of its use as a fuel==
Pentaborane was evaluated by both the U.S. and Russian armed services as a so-called &quot;exotic fuel&quot;. Because simple boron compounds burn with a characteristic green flame, the nickname for this fuel in the U.S. industry was &quot;Green Dragon&quot;. In terms of heat of combustion, pentaborane surpasses its equivalent carbon compounds because their self-linking element, carbon, weighs at least one atomic mass unit more than an atom of boron, and some boranes contain more hydrogen than the carbon equivalent. The ease of breaking the chemical bonds of the compound is also taken into consideration.

Interest in this substance began as a possible fuel for high-speed jets. The propellant mix that would produce the greatest specific impulse for a rocket motor is sometimes given as oxygen difluoride and pentaborane. During the early years of the space race and the missile gap, American rocket engineers thought they could more cheaply produce a rocket that would compete with the Soviets by using an existing first stage and putting an upper stage with an engine that produces thrust at a very high specific impulse atop it, so projects were begun to investigate this fuel.

This pentaborane was considered for use as a fuel by North American Aviation when the XB-70 Valkyrie was in the planning stages, but the aircraft ended up using hydrocarbon fuel instead. Pentaborane was also investigated to be used as a bipropellant with nitrogen tetroxide. In the Soviet Union, Valentin Glushko used it for the experimental RD-270M rocket engine, under development between 1962 and 1970.

Other boranes were evaluated as fuels, including propylpentaborane (BEF-2) and ethyldecaborane (REF-3). Diborane and decaborane and their derivates were also investigated.

Problems with this fuel include its toxicity and its characteristic of bursting into flame on contact with the air. Furthermore, its exhaust (when used in a jet engine) would also be toxic. 

The US destroyed its last stockpiles of &quot;Green Dragon&quot; in 2000, long after the pentaborane had been discarded as unworkable. The destruction procedure hydrolyzed the pentaborane with steam to yield hydrogen and a boric acid solution. The long delay occurred in part because there are no industrial plants consuming pentaborane as a feedstock. Instead, army engineers constructed a bespoke system, nicknamed the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;.

==Safety==

Above 30 °C it can form explosive concentration of vapors with air. Its vapors are heavier than air. It is pyrophoric—can ignite spontaneously in contact with air, when even slightly impure. It can also readily form shock sensitive explosive compounds, and reacts violently with some fire suppressants, notably with halocarbons and water. It is highly toxic and symptoms of lower-level exposure may occur with up to 48 hours delay. Its acute toxicity is comparable to some nerve agents.

Occupational exposure limits for pentaborane set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health stand at 0.005 ppm (0.01 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average, with a short-term exposure limit of 0.015 ppm (0.03 mg/m3). The acute toxicity of pentaborane has caused it to be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, with a limit set at 1 ppm.

<doc id="1194038" wikidata="Q15758" url="?curid=1194038" title="Anapa">
<text>Anapa (, , ) is a town in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, located on the northern coast of the Black Sea near the Sea of Azov. As of the 2021 Russian census, it had a population of 81,863. It is one of the largest children&#x27;s resorts in Russia.

In ancient times, Anapa was the site of a major seaport and a capital of the Sindi people. In the 6th century BCE, it was settled by Greeks, who called it Gorgippia. In later centuries, the settlement came under the control of Genoa and then the Ottoman Empire. In 1781, a fortress was constructed there, which became the site of multiple sieges during the Russo-Turkish wars. It was finally annexed by the Russian Empire in 1829, after several occupations.

==History==

The area around Anapa was settled in antiquity. It was originally a major seaport (Sinda) and then the capital of Sindica. The colony of Gorgippia () was built on the site of Sinda in the 6th century BCE by Pontic Greeks, who named it after a king of the Cimmerian Bosporus. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, Gorgippia flourished as part of the Bosporan Kingdom, as did its guild of shipowners, which controlled maritime trade in the eastern part of the Black Sea. A fine statue of Neokles (a local potentate, son of Herodoros) was unearthed by Russian archaeologists and is now on exhibit at the Russian Museum. Gorgippia was inhabited until the 3rd century CE, when it was overrun by neighbouring native tribes. These tribes, of Circassian or Adyghe origin (specifically of the Natkhuay tribe), gave Anapa its modern name.

Later the Black Sea littoral was overrun by successive waves of Asiatic nomads, including the Sarmatians, Ostrogoths, Huns, Avars, Gokturks, Khazars, Tatars and Circassians who are native to the Northwestern Caucasus. The settlement was renamed Mapa by the Genoese at the turn of the 14th century. Genoese domination lasted until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet in 1475. In 1781, during the reign of Abdul Hamid I, French engineers built a fortress at Anapa for the Ottomans. The fortress was repeatedly attacked by the Russian Empire and was all but destroyed during its last siege in 1829. The town was passed to Russia after the Treaty of Adrianople (1829). See . It was included in Black Sea Okrug of Kuban Oblast and was granted town status in 1846.

It was occupied by Ottomans between 1853 and 1856 during the Crimean War. It became part of Black Sea Governorate in 1896. Elizabeth Pilenko, later named as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, was the mayor during the Russian Revolution. It became part of Kuban-Black Sea Oblast in 1920. During World War II, it was occupied and totally demolished by Nazi Germany with the help of Romanian troops between August 30, 1942 and September 22, 1943.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Anapa serves as the administrative center of Anapsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with three rural localities, incorporated separately as the Town of Anapa—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the territories of the Town of Anapa and of Anapsky District are incorporated as Anapa Urban Okrug.
==Tourism==
The town boasts a number of sanatoria and hotels. Anapa is served by the Anapa Airport. Anapa seldom attracts tourists from outside Russia due to its modest infrastructure and its inconvenient accessibility from Europe via Moscow or Krasnodar.

==Transportation==

Transportation facilities include an international passenger port for small-tonnage ships, the Anapa Airport, a railway station, a bus station, and a network of highways.

==Climate==
Anapa has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;) influences at the lower elevations. Compared to cities further south along the coast like Novorossiysk and Sochi, Anapa receives considerably less rainfall but has somewhat colder winters.


== Demographics ==
The population of Anapa according to recent censuses is as follows: 

==Culture==
The Town Theater of Anapa is located on Krymskaya Street. It was opened after the reconstruction of the Town Cultural Center. There are twenty-nine public libraries, including four for children. In 2010 the libraries of Anapa received more than 8,000 books, and magazines and newspapers were ordered costing more than 1,000,000 rubles; in addition, nine hundred CDs were purchased. 

There is museum of Local History () on Protapova Street.

<text>Alfred John Shout, (8 August 1882 – 11 August 1915) was a New Zealand–born soldier and an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Shout was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions at Lone Pine in August 1915, during the Gallipoli campaign of the First World War. After Ottoman forces had counterattacked and seized a large stretch of the Australians&#x27; front line, Shout gathered a small party of men and charged down one trench throwing bombs. He killed eight Turkish soldiers, and managed to clear others to retake the trench. In a similar action later that day, and supported by another officer, he recaptured further ground amid heavy fighting. In the final push forward, Shout simultaneously lit three bombs to lob at the enemy. He successfully threw two, but just as the third left his hand it detonated. Shout was severely wounded and died two days later.

Born in Wellington, Shout had served in the Second Boer War as a teenager. He rose to sergeant and was mentioned in despatches for saving a wounded man before being discharged in 1902. He remained in South Africa for the next five years, serving as an artilleryman in the Cape Colonial Forces from 1903. With his Australian-born wife and their daughter, Shout immigrated to Sydney in 1907. The family settled in Darlington, where Shout worked for Resch&#x27;s Brewery as a carpenter and joiner. He was also active in the part-time Citizens&#x27; Forces, being commissioned just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In August 1914, he joined in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for active service overseas and was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion. After training in Egypt, he took part in the Anzac landings at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion and its immediate aftermath, Shout was awarded the Military Cross and later mentioned in despatches. Shout&#x27;s three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.

==Early life==

Alfred John Shout was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 8 August 1882. He was the eldest of nine children to an English-born father, John Richard Shout, and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (née Kelly, formerly McGovern). Information on Alfred Shout&#x27;s early life is rather scant and the details differ between sources, but according to his First World War attestation form he was privately educated. In early 1900, Shout travelled to South Africa with his elder half-brother, William McGovern. The brothers sought to join one of the colonial contingents then engaged in the Second Boer War; Alfred enlisted in the newly raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (using the surname Shout) found a place in Bethune&#x27;s Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was an irregular colonial force formed in eastern Cape Colony, and Shout was allotted to the unit&#x27;s No. 1 Company with the service number 9216.

Serving at Wittebergen, Transvaal, and in the Cape Colony with the Border Horse, Shout was twice wounded, including once in the chest. In an action at Thabaksberg on 29 January 1901, the then Lance Corporal Shout assisted in maintaining the position of his men. At one point during the engagement, he ventured out under heavy rifle fire to retrieve a wounded man, and brought him back to a covered position; Shout&#x27;s bravery in this action earned him a mention in despatches. He was promoted to sergeant on 7 May 1901, and discharged from the Border Horse 16 days later. He then served with the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop until 1902. Shout was issued the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal with &quot;Wittebergen&quot;, &quot;Transvaal&quot; and &quot;Cape Colony&quot; clasps, and the King&#x27;s South Africa Medal with the clasps &quot;South Africa 1901&quot; and &quot;South Africa 1902&quot; for his service in the Boer War.

Shout decided to remain in South Africa after his discharge and, in 1903, enlisted in the Cape Colonial Forces. He was made a sergeant in Prince Alfred&#x27;s Own Cape Field Artillery, with which he served until 1907. While living in Cape Town, Shout married Rose Alice Howe, an Australian from Sydney, in 1905; the couple had a daughter named Florence in June that year. In 1907, the Shout family immigrated to Australia, settling in the Sydney suburb of Darlington. Here, Shout gained employment as a carpenter and joiner at Resch&#x27;s Brewery. He also joined the 29th Infantry Regiment of the part-time Citizens&#x27; Forces shortly after arriving in Sydney, was a foundation member of the 29th Infantry Club, and a regular visitor at the Randwick rifle range, where he gained a reputation as an excellent shot. Shout was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens&#x27; Forces on 16 June 1914.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the First World War, Shout applied for a commission in the newly raised Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 18 August 1914. The AIF was formed as Australia&#x27;s expeditionary force to fight in the war, as the Citizens&#x27; Forces were restricted to home defence per the Defence Act (1903). Shout&#x27;s application was accepted on 28 August and he was posted to the 1st Battalion as a second lieutenant in F Company, commanded by Lieutenant Cecil Sasse. According to his medical assessment at the time, Shout stood at , weighed , and was recorded as having &quot;good&quot; eyesight. On 18 October, the 1st Battalion embarked for the Middle East, with Shout boarding HMAT &quot;Afric&quot; at Sydney. Sailing via Albany, Western Australia, the troopship arrived in Egypt on 2 December. Shortly after, the 1st Battalion was reorganised into four companies; Shout was allotted to D Company as a platoon commander. The battalion spent the next four months training in the Egyptian desert, during which time Shout was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1915.

===Gallipoli===
====Landing at Anzac====

As part of an endeavour to defeat the Ottoman Empire and force a supply route through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea, the British War Council formulated a plan to invade the Gallipoli Peninsula. On 25 April 1915, the men of the 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—landed at Anzac Cove between 05:30 and 07:30 among the second and third waves of Australian troops. The 1st Battalion was meant to be held in reserve, but due to heavy casualties and confusion the unit soon went into action. Following a request for reinforcements, Shout moved up with one of the 1st Battalion&#x27;s companies to the hill feature Baby 700. Arriving at the position around 11:00, he led a party to hold the rear left flank of the hill as part of the Australians&#x27; rearguard action. The Australian position on Baby 700 had become dire by that afternoon, a situation compounded by the small number of available infantry in the area and the complete lack of artillery support, when the Turkish forces launched a counter-assault. By this time, Shout and Lieutenant Leslie Morshead of the 2nd Battalion were the only two surviving officers in their sector of the line. At 16:30, the Turks broke through the defensive line and the Australians were forced to abandon their position on the hill. Shout was one of the last to evacuate, and withdrew down towards the beach. During his retreat, Shout encountered Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, on Walker&#x27;s Ridge. Braund dispatched Shout to the beach with a request for reinforcements. Shout duly relayed the message, and was immediately tasked with leading 200 stray men to reinforce the thin defensive line near Braund&#x27;s position. Shout established a post at the base of the ridge as dusk began to fall, and his men started to dig in.

By 27 April, Shout had been continually in action without rest since the landing. That morning, he was sent to Walker&#x27;s Ridge to replace a wounded officer in a vulnerable sector of the line. As the Turks occupied positions in the scrub just beyond the Australians&#x27; trench, Shout and his men were subjected to accurate and heavy rifle fire throughout the day. Accordingly, Shout reorganised his men and, exposing himself to the Turks&#x27; fire, ventured out to reconnoitre the enemy&#x27;s position. He was then able to accurately direct the rifle fire of his men. Though wounded early in the action, Shout refused to leave the frontline. As the fighting wore on, the Turks closed in on the Australian trench and Shout led a bayonet charge to hold them at bay. He was later wounded a second time, a bullet passing through his arm and rendering it useless. Still, he refused to leave. Soon after, he was wounded a third time and evacuated for medical treatment. During the engagement, Shout had carried several wounded men away from the frontline. Cited for his &quot;conspicuous courage and ability&quot; at Walker&#x27;s Ridge, Shout was awarded the Military Cross, becoming the first member of his battalion to receive the decoration. The notification and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 3 July 1915.

Shout&#x27;s wounds proved to be relatively light and he soon rejoined the 1st Battalion. On 11 May, he was wounded once again, suffering a second gunshot to his arm. He was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS &quot;Gascon&quot;, but rejoined his unit fifteen days later. On 20 May, Shout was mentioned in the despatch of General Sir Ian Hamilton, General Officer Commanding the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, in recognition of his efforts from the landing on 25 April to 5 May. He was promoted to captain on 29 July.

====Lone Pine====

On 6 August 1915, the 1st Australian Brigade launched an assault on the impregnable Ottoman position at Lone Pine. Led by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions (with the 1st Battalion held in reserve), the attack was orchestrated to divert Turkish attention and reinforcements away from the primary operation to the north of the line as the British sought to capture the Sari Bair ridge. The Australian assault at Lone Pine commenced in the late afternoon just before sunset. An artillery barrage had preceded the attack, though according to historian Robin Prior the results had been &quot;feeble&quot; and the advance was hard-fought. Nonetheless, within half an hour the Australians had breached the Turkish trenches and seized their objectives. Despite the initial success, Australian casualties had been heavy and the 1st Battalion was ordered forward in preparation for the expected Turkish counter-attack. The battle descended into fierce fighting over the next three days, often in the form of what Bryan Perrett has described as &quot;deadly bombing duels&quot;.

At 09:00 on 9 August, the day after Shout&#x27;s 33rd birthday, the 1st Battalion relieved the 3rd Battalion on the Lone Pine front at a position known as Sasse&#x27;s Sap. Soon after, the Turks renewed their attack and recaptured a stretch of the sap. Determined to rout these men, and supported by a few of his own soldiers, Shout charged down one trench throwing bombs. He killed eight Turks, and managed to clear others to retake the trench. Meanwhile, Captain Cecil Sasse—Shout&#x27;s former company commander—gathered three men with sandbags, and cleared another section of the sap. Armed with a rifle, Sasse had charged down the trench at the head of his men. His party soon discovered a group of Turks focused on, and firing in, a different direction; Sasse and his men killed 12 and forced the remainder to flee. Sasse continued to keep the Turks at bay with rifle fire as his men barricaded the trench with the sandbags.

Sasse, described by official historian Charles Bean as &quot;elated&quot; by the achievement that morning, approached Shout with a proposal to repeat the feat. Shout agreed. The duo assembled a party of eight men this time to carry sandbags and extra bombs. Having reconnoitred the Turks&#x27; position, the previously erected barricade was shoved down and, side-by-side, Sasse and Shout ran forward. While Sasse fired his revolver and Shout lobbed bombs, the Australian party advanced in short stages along the trench and built a barricade each time they halted. Bean wrote that Shout fought with &quot;splendid gaiety&quot; throughout the assault, historian Stephen Snelling adding that Shout was &quot;laughing and joking and cheering his men on&quot;. As the Australians progressed, the two officers located a suitable position to raise their final barricade. Readying himself for this final push forward, Shout simultaneously lit three bombs. He successfully threw two, but the third burst just as it was leaving his hand. Shout was grievously wounded; the explosion incinerated his right hand and part of the left, destroyed his left eye, cut his cheek, and caused burns to his chest and leg. Despite the severity of his wounds Shout remained conscious and was dragged out of the firing line, where, &quot;still cheerful&quot; according to Bean, he &quot;drank tea and sent a message to his wife&quot;.

==Victoria Cross and legacy==
Shout was evacuated from the Gallipoli Peninsula to the hospital ship &quot;Euralia&quot; shortly after he was wounded. He died two days later, on 11 August 1915, and was buried at sea. Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Bennett, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, labelled Shout&#x27;s actions at Lone Pine as &quot;brilliant&quot; and described him as &quot;unapproachable in his splendid leadership&quot;. Although Sasse&#x27;s Sap was not completely recovered, Shout was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) in recognition of his efforts to recover much of the trench system, while Sasse received the Distinguished Service Order. Shout&#x27;s VC was the seventh and final awarded to the AIF for the operations around Lone Pine, and the second to a member of the 1st Battalion. Shout&#x27;s three gallantry awards from Gallipoli also marked him as the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.

The announcement of Shout&#x27;s VC was promulgated in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 15 October 1915, reading:


There was considerable confusion following Shout&#x27;s death. Army Headquarters in Melbourne cabled Rose Shout on 15 August to inform her that Alfred had been wounded. Confirmation of his death was conveyed to her, but was contradicted by a later cable on 23 August. This communication stated that Shout was not dead, but alive and returning to Australia aboard the &quot;Themistocles&quot;. The press in Australia published news of his pending return, adding that he would arrive in Sydney in mid-September. This proved to be a case of mistaken identity. Shout&#x27;s death was confirmed by 26 August; a Lieutenant A. J. Shirt, also of the 1st Battalion, was the officer aboard the &quot;Themistocles&quot;. Rose Shout received a ministerial apology for the clerical errors and distress caused.

Shout is commemorated on the Lone Pine Memorial, and he was remembered by the citizens of Darlington with a memorial plaque. The governor-general, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, unveiled the plaque at the Darlington Town Hall in a ceremony on 20 November 1915. The plaque has since entered the collections of the Victoria Barracks Museum in Paddington. In 1916, to honour &quot;the heroic and glorious deeds and death&quot; of Shout and relieve the financial strain placed upon his wife, a collection was taken up by local citizens in Sydney to provide Rose and their daughter with a house.

Until 2006 Shout&#x27;s medals were in the possession of his family. That year, Shout&#x27;s grandson decided to sell the medals to relieve some of the family debt and financial burdens. At the time Shout&#x27;s VC was the only one awarded to a member of the AIF at Gallipoli that was not in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The medals were auctioned by the Sydney firm Bonhams &amp; Goodman on 24 July 2006, and realised a world record hammer price of AU$1 million. The sale surpassed, almost doubling, the previous auction records for a medal—set by the Naval Gold Medal awarded to Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet—and the price paid for a VC, previously held by that awarded to Norman Cyril Jackson. Shout&#x27;s medals were purchased by media mogul Kerry Stokes, who subsequently donated the set to the Australian War Memorial for display in the Hall of Valour.

<text>Ijuin Tada&#x27;aki(伊集院忠朗; 1520–1561) was a retainer of the Japanese Shimazu clan during the Sengoku period of Japan. Under Tada&#x27;aki, the Ijuin clan rose to prominence as one of the most important vassals of the Shimazu clan.

He served under Shimazu Tadayoshi and Shimazu Takahisa, who were essential in uniting the Shimazu clan. Tada&#x27;aki had his troops use matchlock guns at the Siege of Kajiki in 1549. This was the first use of firearms by the Shimazu army. He also fought in battles against the Ito clan and Kimotsuki clan, and at the Siege of Iwatsurugi in 1554. For these and other contributions and services, he held the post of the top &quot;karō&quot; until 1556 and governed as the top official of the clan.

While having a party with Kimotsuki Kanetsugu in 1561, Tada&#x27;aki offended Kanetsugu so badly that the humiliated Kanetsugu started a war that the Shimazu clan wanted all along.

<text>Stavros S Niarchos is a British brig-rigged tall ship, now renamed &quot;Sunset&quot;. She was previously owned and operated by the Tall Ships Youth Trust (TSYT). She was primarily designed to provide young people with the opportunity to undertake voyages as character-building exercises, rather than pure sail-training. She was also used for adult voyages and holidays, which helped subsidise the operation of the ship.

== Construction ==
In the late 1990s the two schooners (&quot;Malcolm Miller&quot; and &quot;Sir Winston Churchill&quot;) then owned by the Tall Ships Youth Trust (then called the Sail Training Association (STA)) were showing their age and becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. The hulls for the two new brigs (&quot;Stavros S Niarchos&quot; and her sister ship, &quot;Prince William&quot;) were obtained half-completed from another project in Germany. These were transported to Appledore Ship Yards in Devon, where they were modified to the TSYT&#x27;s requirements, and fitted out. She was completed in January 2000. The rig was designed by Michael Willoughby, who wrote a few comments on the overall design of the brigs.
The Stavros S Niarchos was named after Greek philanthropist Stavros Niarchos whose Foundation Trust funded the vessel.

== Notable voyages ==
Following completion of sea trials she was handed over to the STA at Avonmouth Docks. She sailed for her maiden voyage, a training voyage for permanent and volunteer crew, on 13 February 2000. She arrived in Weymouth, UK three days later.

During that trip she encountered a south westerly gale as she came round Land&#x27;s End. She achieved an indicated speed through the water of under lower tops&#x27;ls and fore topmast stays&#x27;l alone.

In January 2006 &quot;Stavros S Niarchos&quot; rescued the two women crew from a vessel taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing race. The rescue was made in heavy weather, with the assistance of a USCG Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. In late 2006 TSYT Captain Darren Naggs was awarded the Thomas Gray Silver Medal of the Marine Society, for exemplary seamanship during the rescue.

== Rig ==
&quot;Stavros S Niarchos&quot; is a brig, that is a two masted vessel with square sails on both masts. She carries five yards on each mast (moving up: Course, Lower Topsail, Upper Topsail, Topgallant and Royal), and a total of 18 sails. In good conditions she has managed speeds of just over .
== Crew ==
&quot;Stavros S Niarchos&quot; (and her sister ship, &quot;Prince William&quot;) normally sail with a crew of up to 67 people. The crew consists of 6 permanent salaried crew, 11 to 13 volunteer crew and up to 48 voyage crew. The voyage crewmembers, those paying to sail on the ship, are divided into three watches (Red, White and Blue) of 16. Each of these watches has a Watch Leader from the volunteer crew. The remaining crew are assigned as follows:

Permanent crew:
* Captain (Master)
* Chief Mate
* Second Mate
* Chief Engineer
* Boatswain (Bosun)
* Cook

Volunteer crew:
* Third Mate
* First Aid Purser
* 2nd Cook
* Assistant Cook
* Assistant Engineer
* 3 × Watch Leaders
* 2 × Deckhands (3 on adult voyages)
* 2 × Youth Mentors (youth voyages only)
* 2 × Supernumeraries (optional, adult voyages only)

On youth voyages the two Youth Mentors (YMs) are responsible for the various entertainment activities and competitions as well helping with any problems young people aboard may have. They are usually professionally qualified teachers or youth workers.

The 2 or 3 deckhands act as assistants to the bosun and as such are mostly concerned with the cleaning and maintenance of the ship.

==Future==

In November 2011, the Tall Ships Youth Trust announced plans to sell &quot;Stavros S Niarchos&quot;, its last remaining tall ship, to focus on smaller vessels. Much of this is due to the high cost of running a vessel of such size due to pilotage charges and mooring fees for a vessel over 400 tonnes. This has become a contentious issue with the trust and its supporters where some see this as the abandonment of the tall ships for yachts within the trust. For others this is a return to the days of &quot;Sir Winston Churchill&quot; and &quot;Malcolm Miller&quot; which as smaller vessels didn&#x27;t incur these charges and perhaps had better sailing and penetration and operation within UK sailing ports and waters. Although the schooners were smaller, some say they ran a much better programme and fulfilled the mandate of the former Sail Training Association, before it became TSYT.

The ship will continue in operation until a buyer is found, which the Trust expects to take several years based on their experience of selling &quot;Prince William&quot;.


The ship was sold on 30 September 2017 via C.W. Kellock &amp; Co. Ltd., a London-based ship broker. It is no longer part of the Tall Ships Youth Trust fleet. On 16 October 2017, the ship&#x27;s AIS broadcast name changed to &quot;Sunset&quot;.

<text>Jack Black (1871–1932) was a Canadian and American hobo and burglar. Black is best known for his autobiography &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot; (Macmillan, 1926), describing his days on the road and life as an outlaw. Black&#x27;s book was written as an anti-crime book urging criminals to go straight, but it is also his statement of belief in the futility of prisons and the criminal justice system, hence the title of the book. Jack Black was writing from experience, having spent thirty years (fifteen of which were spent in various prisons in Canada and the United States) as a travelling criminal, and offers tales of being a cross-country stick-up man, home burglar, petty thief, and opium addict. He gained fame as a prison reformer, writer, and playwright. He disappeared in 1932 in a likely suicide.

==Life==
Black was born in 1871 in New Westminster, British Columbia and was raised from infancy in the U.S. state of Missouri in the town of Maysville and eventually Kansas City. Aside from this, Jack Black is an essentially anonymous figure; even his actual name is uncertain. In his autobiographical book, he quotes his father as calling him &quot;John,&quot; of which Jack is often a nickname. Some 1904 news articles name him as Jack Black, alias Tom Callahan, while a 1912 newspaper article names him Thomas Callaghan, alias Jack Black, and another gives his alias as Harry Klein. One of his nicknames among criminals was Blacky.

After his last spell in prison, Black became friends with wealthy patron Fremont Older and worked for his newspaper &quot;The San Francisco Call&quot;. Black wrote his autobiography with Rose Wilder Lane and eventually composed essays and lectured throughout the country on prison reform. He was also rumored to have received a stipend of $150 a week to draft a screenplay titled &quot;Salt Chunk Mary&quot; with co-author Bessie Beatty, based around the vagabond ally and fence of the same name in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot;. The play flopped, although he was able to attain some amount of popularity, which subsided quickly.

His philosophy on life was especially influential to William S. Burroughs, who associated with similar characters in his early adulthood. He also mirrored the style of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot; with his first published book, &quot;Junkie&quot;. In his foreword to the 1988 edition of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot; (reproduced in a 2000 edition), Burroughs wrote:

I first read &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot; in 1926, in an edition bound in red cardboard. Stultified and confined by middle-class St. Louis mores, I was fascinated by this glimpse of an underworld of seedy rooming houses, pool parlors, cat houses and opium dens, of bull pens and cat burglars and hobo jungles. I learned about the Johnson Family of good bums and thieves, with a code of conduct that made more sense to me than the arbitrary, hypocritical rules that were taken for granted as being &quot;right&quot; by my peers.

==Disappearance==
He disappeared in 1932 and is believed to have committed suicide by drowning, as he reportedly told his friends that if life got too grim, he would row out into New York Harbor and, with weights tied to his feet, drop overboard. In &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, Black describes this state of mind as being &quot;ready for the river&quot;.

<text>Kilmacduagh Monastery is a ruined abbey near the town of Gort in County Galway, Ireland. It was the birthplace of the Diocese of Kilmacduagh. It was reportedly founded by Saint Colman, son of Duagh in the 7th century, on land given him by his cousin King Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin of Connacht.

==Overview==
Kilmacduagh Monastery is located in a small village of the same name, about 5 km from the town of Gort.

The name of the place translates as &quot;church of Duagh&#x27;s son&quot;. It was reportedly the 7th century Saint Colman, son of Duagh who established a monastery here on land given to him by his cousin King Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin of Connacht, who had a fortified dwelling near what is today Dunguaire Castle.

==History==
As with most dates from this period, the year in which the monastery was founded is somewhat uncertain, but apparently the early 7th century is deemed the most likely.

Colman was abbot/bishop at the monastery until his death. Of his successors, only one appears in the annals by name, one Indrect (died 814), before the arrival of the English.

This site was of such importance in medieval times that it became the centre of a new diocese, or Bishop&#x27;s seat, the Diocese of Kilmacduagh, in the 12th century.

The early monastery was victim of multiple raids and finally ruined by William de Burgh in the early 13th century. To replace it, the local lord Owen O&#x27;Heyne (died 1253) founded the abbey of St. Mary de Petra as house for the Augustinian canons. The abbey is also attributed to Bishop Maurice Ileyan (died 1283) but the architectural evidence, according to Harold Leask, allows only the later added east range of the abbey to be associated with bishop Maurice. During the reformation this was granted to the Earl of Clanricarde.

The round tower was repaired in 1879 under the supervision of Sir Thomas Deane, with financial support from Sir William Henry Gregory of Coole Park.

The Diocese of Kilmacduagh is now incorporated into the United Dioceses of Tuam and Limerick in the Church of Ireland and in the Roman Catholic divisions, into the Diocese of Galway.

==Today==
The ruins of the monastery are sometimes referred to as &quot;the seven Churches&quot;. However, not all of these buildings were actually churches, none of them dates back to the 7th century. The buildings are:
* The abbey church, former cathedral, or &quot;Teampuil Mor&quot;, in the graveyard
* The &quot;Church of Mary&quot; or &quot;Teampuil Muire&quot; (also known as &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Church&quot;), east of the road
* The &quot;Church of St. John the Baptist&quot; or &quot;Teampuil Eoin Baiste&quot;, to the north of the graveyard
* The &quot;Abbot&#x27;s House&quot; or &quot;Seanclogh&quot;, further north, close to the road
* &quot;Teampuil Beg Mac Duagh&quot;, south of the graveyard
* The &quot;Monastery Church&quot; or &quot;O&#x27;Heyne&#x27;s Church&quot; (or &quot;O&#x27;Heyne&#x27;s Abbey&quot;), ca. 180 metres north-east of the graveyard (13th century)
* The round tower, roughly 15 metres south-west of the cathedral

The round tower is notable both as a fine example of this particularly Irish feature but also because of its noticeable lean, over half a metre from the vertical. The tower is over tall, according to measurements taken in 1879, with the only doorway some 7 metres above ground level. The tower probably dates from the 10th century.

==Legends==

According to legend, Saint Colman MacDuagh was walking through the woods of the Burren when his girdle fell to the ground. Taking this as a sign, he built his monastery on that spot. The girdle was said to be studded with gems and was held by the O&#x27;Shaughnessys centuries later, along with St. Colman&#x27;s crozier, or staff. The girdle was later lost, but the crozier came to be held by the O&#x27;Heynes and may now be seen in the National Museum of Ireland.

It is said that, in the Diocese of Kilmacduagh, no man will ever die from lightning. This legend was put to the test when one unlucky soul was struck, but the force of the bolt made him fly through the air into neighbouring County Clare, where he died.

Many of his English were killed, and others were drowned; for they found no passage by which to escape, except by crossing the lake in boats.&quot;

<text>Ellis Wellwood Sifton (12 October 1891 – 9 April 1917) was a Canadian soldier. Sifton was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Sifton was born in Wallacetown, Ontario and was a farmer when he enlisted in October 1914. 

== Victoria Cross ==
One of four soldiers to earn the Victoria Cross in the Battle of Vimy Ridge (the others were Thain Wendell MacDowell, William Johnstone Milne and John George Pattison), Sifton was 25 years old, and a Lance Sergeant in the 18th (Western Ontario) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 9 April 1917 at Neuville-St.-Vaast, France, during an attack on enemy trenches, Lance-Sergeant Sifton&#x27;s company was held up by machine-gun fire. During an attack on Vimy Ridge, &quot;C&quot; Company of the 18th Battalion was held up during its advance by German machine gunners who had survived the artillery barrage by taking refuge in concrete shelters. As the Canadians moved forward, the German machine guns swept the battlefield, causing heavy casualties. Sifton saw the machine gun nest first. He jumped up, rushed forward and leapt into the trench. He then charged into the German gun crew and knocked the gun over before turning on the gunners with his bayonet, killing each man. More Canadians hurried forward, but not before a small German party moved down the trench towards Sifton. He used his bayonet and his rifle as a club to fight them off until help arrived. Despite these efforts, Sifton was killed during the fighting.

His Victoria Cross citation published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, dated 8 June 1917 reads:
His VC is held by the Elgin County Pioneer Museum in St Thomas, Ontario.

<text>Major John Simpson VC (29 January 1826 – 27 October 1884) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Simpson had served with the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot (later the Black Watch) of the British Army throughout the Crimean campaign, including the Battles of the Alma and Inkerman, the expedition to Kerch and Yeni-Kale, and the Siege of Sevastopol. He then served with the regiment in the Indian Mutiny, including the Second Battle of Cawnpore, the actions of Seraighat, Kudygunge and Shumehabad, and the Siege and Capture of Lucknow, including the assault of La Martinière and Banks&#x27;s Bungalow, and the attack on Fort Ruhya.

It was during the attack on Fort Ruhya on 15 April 1858 that Simpson, then a 32-year-old quartermaster-sergeant, volunteered to go to an exposed point within of the parapet of the fort under heavy fire and carried back a lieutenant and a private, both of whom were seriously wounded. For this action he was awarded the VC.

Simpson was commissioned as a quartermaster on 7 October 1859 and in 1878 he transferred to the Royal Perth Rifles Militia (from 1881 the 3rd Battalion, Black Watch). In 1881 he was granted the honorary rank of Captain and in 1883 he was promoted to Honorary Major. His grave and memorial are at Balbeggie Churchyard, St. Martin&#x27;s, near Perth, Scotland. His medal is on display in the United States at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, in Los Angeles.

<doc id="1194070" wikidata="Q4831680" url="?curid=1194070" title="Ayrshire Bus Owners (A1 Service)">
<text>Ayrshire Bus Owners (A1 Service) Ltd was a prominent independent co-operative bus operator in Ayrshire, Scotland. Based in Ardrossan, it provided local bus services around the towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Stevenston, Kilwinning, Irvine and Dreghorn, as well as the company&#x27;s trunk route from Ardrossan to Kilmarnock. It also provided express coach services from Ardrossan to Glasgow throughout the 1980s.

== History ==
Ayrshire Bus Owners (A1 Service) Ltd was set up as a legal entity on 27 May 1931. The related Ayrshire Bus Owners Association had been formed in 1925. Many of the companies which formed it had existed for much longer.

In the early 1920s there were over 60 operators in an area bound by Largs to the north, Kilmarnock to the east and Ayr by the south. To protect themselves from the main operator in the area, Scottish General Transport, many of the smaller operators grouped together and in 1925 began the Ayrshire Bus Owners Association. The association, which operated as A1 Service, was based on a similar concept in Lanarkshire. The Ayrshire group also chose this trading name and from 1926 offered a regular timetabled service between Ardrossan and Kilmarnock. Each member of the association continued to own and maintain their vehicles at their own premises.

Some regrouping took place in the late 1920s, and some members left to form Clyde Coast Services in spring 1929, operating between Saltcoats and Largs. In 1930 more members, including Dodd&#x27;s Of Troon, broke away to form Ayrshire Bus Owners AA Service, which would later become AA Buses. Clyde Coast Coaches and Dodd&#x27;s Of Troon continue to be prominent coach operators in the west of Scotland, though their bus operations were sold to Stagecoach in the 1990s.

The regulation of the British bus industry was introduced under the 1930 Road Traffic Act and Traffic Commissioners were introduced to licence operators, vehicles and routes. This prompted the Ayrshire Bus Owners to organise in a more formal manner, and the legal company Ayrshire Bus Owners (A1 Service) Ltd was created, with a base at Parkhouse Road, Ardrossan.

A mainly blue livery, with light cream round the window areas and a maroon belt was introduced for the owner&#x27;s vehicles and over the course of 60 years the company would continue as a successful co-operative. Though it was rare for new members to join, many would leave through retirement or ill-health, with their vehicles and shares in the company being sold on to other members. A1 was slow to introduce &#x27;one person operated&#x27; buses, only introducing them in 1983, primarily for evening and Sunday bus services, despite unsuccessfully lobbying against their introduction by other operators to the area Traffic Commissioner, and conductors continued on the arterial Ardrossan/Kilmarnock service well into the late 1990s, even under Stagecoach ownership.

In the mid-1990s A1 Service found itself in a difficult position. The only profitable service was the trunk Ardrossan/Kilmarnock service, which operated every 10 minutes and demanded the use of double decker buses. The company had also been warned about the mechanical state of some its vehicles by the Traffic Commissioner, as many were becoming elderly and unreliable. As a result, some members decided that they wanted out of the company and offered their shares for sale.

The owners came to the agreement that they would approach Western Scottish, which had just recently become a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group, and offer the company for sale. Western Scottish agreed to buy the company and some of its vehicles for £4.3 million, and in January 1995 A1 Service ceased trading as an independent operator and became a subsidiary company of Stagecoach.

At the time of sale, Ayrshire Bus Owners (A1 Service) Ltd operated 97 vehicles, owned by 10 members. A Competition Commission report into the take over cleared Stagecoach of being predatory and approved the sale.

== Today ==
The company was taken over by the Stagecoach Group in January 1995. The simple blue and cream livery the buses wore since the company&#x27;s formation gave way to the Stagecoach corporate blue, red and orange stripes on white, and the legal name of the firm became Stagecoach (A1 Service) Ltd. Though for several years after the take over buses on the former A1 Service routes wore &quot;Stagecoach A1 Service&quot; fleetnames, the unit was eventually amalgamated with Western Buses Ltd and all vehicles except those on the Ardrossan-Kilmarnock service began trading as &quot;Stagecoach Western&quot;. However, buses on route 11 (Ardrossan-Kilmarnock) continued to trade as &quot;Stagecoach A1 Service&quot;, complete with the historical blue and cream livery, which was re-introduced when FirstGroup began competing on the service. Despite the withdrawal of First from Ayrshire in October 2005, new Dennis Tridents were still delivered in the Stagecoach A1 Service livery and brand.

Some of the former A1 members continue to operate their own businesses, including Parkhouse Garage of Ardrossan (service station and car repairs) and McKinnon of Kilmarnock (haulage). McMenemy of Ardrossan wound up their car repairs business in December 2004 and sold their premises to Clydeport plc, although the coach hire operation continued until March 2005. Docherty Of Irvine had always run a parallel coach hire firm separate to A1 Service and ventured back into local bus operation around the Irvine and Kilmarnock area in competition with Stagecoach Western in the late 1990s, but sold its routes and associated vehicles to Stagecoach Western in October 2004. Docherty ceased operations and sold its vehicles in 2009.

The A1 service branding was removed from Stagecoach&#x27;s vehicles on route 11 on 30 May 2010. The next day, Stagecoach rolled out 27 brand new buses in their corporate &quot;swoops&quot;, spelling the end of the A1 livery after over 80 years.

== Competition ==
During its existence as an independent concern, A1 Service experienced little to no competition on any of its services. A1 had a good working relationship with the neighbouring co-operative bus companies, AA Motor Services and Clyde Coast Services, and there was no competition between the three operators. Prior to bus deregulation in 1986, A1 Service did regularly spar with the dominant operator in the region, Western SMT (later Western Scottish). Western had a depot in Ardrossan and also offered a service from Ardrossan to Kilmarnock, though not nearly as frequent as that of A1 Service. Traffic Commissioners court battles took place between A1 Service and Western over the right to serve any new developments, particularly the Chapelhill housing estate in the north of Ardrossan. However, after deregulation any real threat from Western did not materialise and the company scaled down its presence in north Ayrshire.

The 1980 Transport Act freed longer-distance coach services from regulation and a new operator, Bennett&#x27;s of Kilwinning, pioneered express services between Ardrossan to Glasgow. A1 Service introduced a competing service. Ironically, Bennett&#x27;s was to be one of the first Stagecoach acquisitions, and A1 Service found itself competing with the fledgling Perth-based operator. Stagecoach withdrew from the service, allowing Henry Crawford Coaches of Neilston to take over, and A1 itself later withdrew from the route.

In the early 1990s locally based Valley Bus Company introduced a local circular service in competition with A1 in Saltcoats. A1 retaliated by introducing a parallel minibus service while its existing local services continued to run unaffected. After a few the new operator withdrew its service.

Since becoming part of the Stagecoach Group, A1 has faced more sustained and prolonged competition from First Glasgow. With the introduction of Stagecoach services within the city of Glasgow in 1997, First responded by introducing a service between Ardrossan and Kilmarnock. The service ran to the same route and timetable as the Stagecoach route. For a few months after the competing route&#x27;s launch both operators ran their services free of charge. First and Stagecoach continued to compete on the trunk route until the withdrawal of First on 8 October 2005.

<doc id="1194078" wikidata="Q1099159" url="?curid=1194078" title="Claw (video game)">
<text>Claw is a 2D side-scroller platform video game published by Monolith Productions in 1997 about an anthropomorphic pirate cat who sets on a quest to find an ancient amulet while fighting enemies and solving puzzles. It is Monolith&#x27;s second release after &quot;Blood&quot;, which was released that same year in May.

==Plot==
A famous cat pirate, Captain Nathaniel Joseph Claw, is imprisoned by the Cocker-Spaniards (a dog species, a pun on Cocker Spaniel) after they attack and sink his ship. In the prison cell, waiting for his execution, he finds a note and a piece of a map hidden in the wall. The note tells of the Amulet of Nine Lives—a mystical artifact that grants its wearer near-immortality. Breaking out of his cell, Claw sets out to collect all 9 gems of the amulet and retrieve it for himself.

The game begins with Claw outside his cell. As he progresses through the prison, he eventually gets to the outer wall and escapes to the forest after defeating the warden, Le Rauxe. In the forest, he encounters a gang of thieves, headed by his former love interest, Katherine. He manages to defeat them and finds his way out of the forest, and into the nearby port town of El Puerto del Lobo, where he is hunted down by the magistrate, Wolvington, and the city guards. After running through the city, escaping the guards, and defeating Wolvington himself, the Captain stumbles into a bar and overhears a conversation between two of the crew of Captain Red Tail, a lion who is Claw&#x27;s arch enemy. He learns that Red Tail is looking for the gems of the amulet as well, and that Red Tail&#x27;s first mate, Gabriel, has one of them in his possession. He also hears that Red Tail might have more himself.

Claw quickly makes his way through the port and jumps on Red Tail&#x27;s ship, where he defeats the seamen (Gabriel among them) and hides in the ship until it sets port near the Pirate&#x27;s Cove. Claw goes through the rickety wooden structures of the pirate cove, defeating the pirates and their leader, Marrow, Claw&#x27;s former friend. Claw descends into the caves, where he discovers his old crew, presumed dead after the attack on his ship. The crew informs Claw that they were given three gems by a merchant in the tavern, but were forced to give two of them to Red Tail; they managed to keep the third as Red Tail believed there were only two in their possession. The crew then reveals that Red Tail has set sail for Tiger Island, a legendary place most doubted even existed, including Claw. Claw takes the crew&#x27;s gem as well as a piece of the map, which shows a path to Tiger Island through the labyrinth of underwater caverns. The crew offers to accompany him through the caves to Tiger Island, but Claw insists on going alone, telling his crew to acquire a ship and meet him there. The Captain takes the shortcut through the caverns, where he fights through a race of merpeople, who fight him in order to defend their king: a giant frog-like creature called Aquatis. Claw manages to defeat Aquatis with explosives.

Claw resurfaces to face Red Tail and his crew on Tiger Island. Claw manages to bring Red Tail down and acquire the final two gems, yet Red Tail escapes. Claw enters the Tiger Temple at the heart of the island to claim the amulet. There he fights the highly trained tiger guards, avoids the many death traps in the lava-filled temple, and defeats Omar, the captain of the tiger guard, who holds the final gem. Claw places the gems on a pedestal, and Princess Adora appears. She gives Claw the amulet, granting him 9 lives, after summarizing his adventure. Omar is sworn to defend the holder of the Amulet, thus becoming Claw&#x27;s bodyguard. The game ends with Claw on his ship with the amulet, alongside his crew and Omar.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Captain Claw&quot; is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer, with simple melee combat. The objective for Claw is to reach the end of each level, fighting through various enemies and obstacles along the way. Claw&#x27;s main weapon is his sword, though he can also punch or kick when close enough to an enemy. Claw also has a pistol, dynamite and a spell called &quot;Magic Claw&quot;. These items are limited-use, and the player can refill these by collecting spare bullets, dynamite sticks and magic in levels. Also scattered throughout levels are health items, power-ups, and treasure, the last of which awards points. Many hidden or more treacherous areas contain high-value loot, power-ups and bonus lives. Some of these areas are only accessible with a high jump from a power-up, while others are only accessible through portals. Bonus lives are also awarded for reaching certain milestones in total points. In single player, each level has two save points in addition to the game saving at each level&#x27;s completion.

&quot;Captain Claw&quot; has three types of gameplay modes: single player, custom levels, and multiplayer. The single player mode contains the main storyline.

At the end of each level the player will either collect a piece of the map or defeat a boss to receive a gem from the Amulet; odd-numbered levels have map pieces, while even-numbered levels have boss fights and gems. The exception is level 13, which has a boss fight and rewards the player with two gems. Receiving gems also triggers a cutscene.

The custom level loader allows the player to run custom content made by the player or others, but does not provide a method for editing levels in-game. The multiplayer mode allows the player to connect to the Internet and play with up to 64 other people. In the multiplayer mode, the player has to kill as many enemies as possible and gain loot for points to rank up. It also allows for players to race each other to finish a level as quickly as possible.

==Development==
Monolith Productions CEO Jason Hall intended &quot;Claw&quot; to be an entertaining and family-friendly game, saying that non-violent games were rare to find in the contemporary gaming market.

&quot;Claw&quot; was one of the first games to utilize an online multiplayer gaming network jointly created by Microsoft and the National Amusement Network, Inc. (NANI) and, according to &quot;GamePro&quot;, was originally supposed to feature 16 levels and support 256 players through the NANI network.

A special DVD edition of the game was released. The release contained extra content, such as fully animated cutscenes, and more detailed graphics. It was also included in the Creative PC DVD Encore Dxr2 set.

==Reception==

&quot;Claw&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews. Allgame gave &quot;Claw&quot; a highly positive review, comparing its enjoyment value to the &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; franchises. GameSpot gave &quot;Claw&quot; a score of 7.7, stating that it is &quot;easily the finest modern side scroller available for the PC&quot;. Colin Williamson of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; praised the graphics and 64-player mode, but criticized the game for being too similar to other side-scrollers. Craig Majaski of &quot;WorldVillage&quot; praised the game and gave it a score of 4/5. Gamasutra&#x27;s Daniel Bernstein cited the game&#x27;s use of sound as an example of immersive environments in gaming. &quot;PC Powerplay&quot; gave the game a mixed score of 62%; reviewer David Wildgoose criticized Monolith&#x27;s decision to release a 2D platformer in the late 1990s, mentioning the contemporary release of 3D games such as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, and concluded that &quot;Claw&quot; &quot;might have been an excellent 3D platformer&quot;. Despite its success, the game is known for its high difficulty. It is considered a cult classic for its unique style, sense of adventure and beautiful graphics.

In a retrospective positive review, Anthony Burch of &quot;Destructoid&quot; wrote that &quot;Claw&quot; is &quot;accessible&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;, but cited the game&#x27;s high difficulty.

==Legacy==
Around 1999, work on a sequel to &quot;Claw&quot; called &quot;Captain Claw 2 in 3D&quot; was in development by Monolith using the first incarnation of LithTech. However, due to copyright issues with the character Captain Claw, Monolith dropped the project, and passed all codes and assets of the unreleased sequel to a Polish game developer called Techland. Techland announced that a sequel to &quot;Claw&quot; was going to be released in November 2007 under the name of &quot;Captain Claw 2&quot;. The release date was delayed to 2008 and the game was renamed to &quot;Jack, the Pirate Cat&quot;. The game was later renamed to &quot;Nikita: The Mystery of the Hidden Treasure&quot; and a trailer was released on YouTube. The game was released later that year and became a stand-alone game that had nothing to do with the original game. The engine for &quot;Claw&quot;, internally known as the Windows Animation Package 32 (after the original 16 bit Windows Animation Package first written by Brian Goble for his shareware game &quot;The Adventures of Microman&quot;), was also used by Monolith in &quot;Get Medieval&quot; and &quot;Gruntz&quot;.

<doc id="1194080" wikidata="Q372007" url="?curid=1194080" title="Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology">
<text>The Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology (SSB) was a science award in India given annually by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) for notable and outstanding research, applied or fundamental, in biology, chemistry, environmental science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, and physics. The prize recognized outstanding Indian work (according to the view of CSIR awarding committee) in science and technology. It was the highest, most prestigious and coveted prize given in the area of multidisciplinary science in India. The award was named after the founder Director of the Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar. It was first awarded in 1958. 

In 2024, the Government of India continued the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology with the &quot;Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar&quot; called the Vigyan Yuva - Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award. While the prize money and lifetime monthly fellowship were removed, the award’s stature has been elevated to align with India&#x27;s prestigious Padma awards, which also do not include a monetary component. The &quot;Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar&quot; has been designed to bring the same level of respect and honor to scientific achievements as the Padma awards do for other fields.

Recipients of the Vigyan Yuva - Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award are honored with a national ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where the awards are presented by the President of India in the presence of the Minister of Science and top officials from India’s leading scientific institutions. This format ensures that the awardees receive the same recognition, respect, and dignity as Padma award recipients, reflecting the government&#x27;s continued commitment to honoring significant contributions to science and technology in India.

Any citizen of India engaged in research in any field of science and technology up to the age of 45 years was eligible for the prize. The prize was awarded on the basis of contributions made through work done in India only during the five years preceding the year of the prize. 

== Nomination and selection ==

Names of candidates were proposed by a member of the governing body of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Vice-Chancellors of universities or institutes of national importance, and deans of different faculties of science and former awardees. Selection was made by the Advisory Committee constituted each year and necessarily consists of at least six experts including at least one former Bhatnagar Awardee in the respective discipline. At least 2/3 agreement of the members was required for selection. If two nominees were unanimously recommended in the same field because of equal merit, both are awarded.

== Prizes ==
The prize was divided into seven disciplines, namely:
* Biological Sciences
* Chemical Sciences
* Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences
* Engineering Sciences
* Mathematical Sciences
* Medical Sciences
* Physical Sciences.

Each discipline could have multiple winners (maximum 2 individuals). Up until 2007, the prize money was and was raised to in 2008.

== Recipients ==
* List of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize recipients

==Presentation==

The names of the recipients were traditionally declared by the Director General on every 26 September, which is the CSIR Foundation Day. The prize was distributed by the Prime Minister of India. The awardee was bound to give a lecture in the area of the award, generally outside his/her city of work.

<text>was the sixteenth head of the Kimotsuki family and the son of Kimotsuki Kaneoki. Kanetsugu was a skilled and smart leader, but his domain happened to be next to that of the most powerful clan in Kyūshū, the Shimazu clan, and the Kimotsuki family would be defeated by them.

After his father, Kaneoki, died, Kanetsugu killed his uncle Kimotsuki Kaneshu to become the head of the clan. Kanetsugu believed that maintaining a good relationship with the neighboring Shimazu clan was essential to the clan&#x27;s survival and had the eldest daughter of Shimazu Tadayoshi as his wife as well as having his sister marry Shimazu Takahisa. On the other hand, he moved to unify Ōsumi Province and captured Takaoka Castle in 1538 to capture the majority of the province. In 1533, he had his son Kimotsuki Yoshikane take over the clan and retired but still held onto most of the actual power.

In 1561, the relationship between his clan and the Shimazu collapsed and Kanetsugu allied his clan with the Itō clan of Hyūga Province to counter Shimazu. In the same year, he repelled invading Shimazu troops with much success and killed the younger brother of Takahisa, Shimazu Tadamasa. Knowing that there was no turning back, Kanetsugu tried to divorce his wife who was of from the Shimazu clan, but she did not agree and declined the offer.

In 1562, Kanetsugu and his troops captured Shibushi district to hold the largest domain. In 1566, the Shimazu clan massed its army and invaded again, capturing Kōyama Castle as well as most of Kimotsuki&#x27;s domains. The desperate Kanetsugu retired to a small castle near the Shibushi area and committed suicide.

<doc id="1194084" wikidata="Q270940" url="?curid=1194084" title="Chicken Little (2005 film)">
<text>Chicken Little is a 2005 American animated science fiction comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Mark Dindal from a screenplay by Steve Bencich, Ron J. Friedman, and Ron Anderson, based on a story by Dindal and Mark Kennedy, loosely inspired on the European folk tale &quot;Henny Penny&quot;, known in the United States as &quot;Chicken Little&quot;. In this version, the title character is ridiculed by his town for causing a panic, thinking that the sky was &quot;falling&quot;. A year later he attempts to fix his reputation, followed by an unexpected truth regarding his past being revealed. The film is dedicated to Disney artist and writer Joe Grant, who died before the film&#x27;s release. This also marked the final film appearance of Don Knotts during his lifetime, as his next and final film, &quot;Air Buddies&quot; (another Disney-produced film that was released just over a year later), would be released posthumously.

&quot;Chicken Little&quot; was animated in-house at Walt Disney Feature Animation&#x27;s main headquarters in Burbank, California. It is Disney Animation&#x27;s first fully computer-animated feature film, as &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000) was a combination of live-action and computer animation which in turn was provided by Disney&#x27;s The Secret Lab.

&quot;Chicken Little&quot; was Disney&#x27;s second adaptation of the fable after an anti-Nazi propaganda cartoon made during World War II, serving as a loose remake to the cartoon. The film is also the last Disney animated film produced under the name Walt Disney Feature Animation before the studio was renamed Walt Disney Animation Studios. &quot;Chicken Little&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles on October 30, 2005, and had its wide release on November 4, in Disney Digital 3-D (the first film to be released in this format) and 2D. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $314 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2005 (behind &quot;Madagascar&quot;).

==Plot==

In the town of Oakey Oaks, &quot;Chicken Little&quot; Cluck rings the school bell and warns everyone to run for their lives. This sends the town into a panic. Eventually, the Head of the Fire Department calms down enough to ask him what is going on. He explains that the sky is falling because a piece of it had fallen on his head when he was sitting under the big oak tree in the town square; however, he cannot find the piece. His father, Buck &quot;Ace&quot; Cluck, who was once a high school baseball star, assumes that it was just an acorn that had fallen off the tree and had hit him on the head, making Chicken Little the laughingstock of the town.

A year later, Chicken Little has become infamous in the town for being prone to ruin everything accidentally. His only friends are other outcasts: Abby Mallard (nicknamed &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;), Runt (a cowardly pig), and Fish Out of Water (who wears a helmet full of tap water). Chicken Little joins his school&#x27;s baseball team to recover his reputation and his father&#x27;s pride but is made last until the ninth inning of the last game. He hits the ball and makes it past first, second, and third bases but is met at home plate by the outfielders. He tries sliding onto the home plate but is touched by the ball. While it is presumed he lost the game, the umpire brushes away the dust to reveal Chicken Little&#x27;s foot is touching home plate, thus declaring him safe and the game won; Chicken Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant.

Later that night back at home, Chicken Little is hit on the head yet again by the same &quot;piece of the sky&quot; — only to find out that it is not that, but rather a panel that blends into the background (which would thereby explain why Chicken Little could not find it last time). He calls his friends over to help figure out what it is.

When Fish pushes a button on the back of the hexagon, it flies into the sky, taking him with it. It turns out to be part of the camouflage of an invisible UFO piloted by two aliens. Chicken Little, Abby and Runt rescue Fish, and discover that the aliens are heading to Earth. The two aliens attack the group, chasing them through a cornfield. They rush back to the school, where Chicken Little rings the bell to warn everyone, but the aliens escape, leaving an orange alien child behind. No one believes the story of the alien invasion and Chicken Little&#x27;s reputation is ruined again. The next morning, he and his friends discover the orange alien named Kirby, and minutes later, a fleet of alien ships descend on the town and start what appears to be an invasion. The invasion, however, is actually a misunderstanding, as the two aliens are looking for their lost child and attack only out of concern. As the aliens rampage throughout Oakey Oaks, supposedly vaporizing everything in their path, Chicken Little realizes he must return Kirby to his parents to save the planet.

In the invasion, Buck, having regained his pride and trust in his son, defends him from the aliens until they get &quot;vaporized.&quot; The aliens, however, are not actually vaporizing people but teleporting them aboard the UFO. It turns out the aliens were touring Earth and came across the town for its acorns. Their ship has broken camo panels that fell and hit Chicken Little on the head. After everything is explained, the apologetic aliens return everything to normal, and everyone is grateful for Chicken Little&#x27;s efforts to save the town.

Another year later, Chicken Little, Buck, his friends and the citizens of Oakey Oaks watch an in-universe movie depicting a fanciful retelling of the events that transpired, portraying Chicken Little as an action hero named Ace.

==Production==
===Writing===
In September 2001, director Mark Dindal developed the idea for &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, with its title character envisioned as a paranoid female chicken with the voice of Holly Hunter that went to summer camp to reduce her anxiety, as well as repair her relationship with her father. At the summer camp, she would uncover a nefarious plot that her camp counselor, who was to be voiced by Penn Jillette, was planning against her hometown. Dindal would later pitch his idea to Michael Eisner who suggested it would be better to change Chicken Little into a male because as Dindal recalled, &quot;if you&#x27;re a boy and you&#x27;re short, you get picked on.&quot; However, Dindal later clarified that the decision was made, in part, due to market research stating, &quot;I remember being told, &#x27;Girls will go see a movie with a boy protagonist but boys won&#x27;t see a movie with a girl protagonist,&#x27;... &quot;That was the wisdom at the time, until &quot;Frozen&quot; comes out and makes $1 billion.&quot;

In January 2003, when David Stainton became Disney&#x27;s new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, he decided the story needed a different approach. He told the director the script had to be revised, and during the next three months, it was rewritten into a tale of a boy trying to save his town from space aliens.

During the rewriting process, Dindal, along with three credited writers and nine others, threw out twenty-five scenes to improve the character development and add more emotional resonance with the parent-child relationship. Dindal stated that &quot;It took us about 2½ years to pretty much get back to where we started... But in the course of that, the story got stronger, more emotional, and Amazing, too.&quot;

===Casting===
When originally envisioned as a female character, Holly Hunter provided the voice for the title character for eight months, until it was decided for Chicken Little to be a male. Michael J. Fox, Dave Foley, D.B. Sweeney, Ben Stiller, Matt Damon, Justin Long, Leonardo DiCaprio, Shia LaBeouf, Steve Martin, Jon Heder, Matthew Broderick, Jason Lee, Jack Black, Paul Walker, Robin Williams, John Travolta, Tom Kenny, Nathan Lane, Drake Bell, Josh Peck, Keanu Reeves, and David Spade were all originally considered for the role. Against forty actors competing for the title role, Zach Braff auditioned where Dindal noted he &quot;pitched his voice slightly to sound like a junior high kid. Right there, that was really unique — and then he had such great energy.&quot;

In April 2002, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Sean Hayes was to voice a character named the Ugly Duckling, but the character was rewritten into a female. Now conceived as Abby Mallard, Hunter, Jamie Donnelly, Jamie Lee Curtis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jodie Foster, Laura Dern, Geena Davis, and Madonna were considered, but Joan Cusack won the role for her natural comedy. In December 2003, it was announced Braff and Cusack were cast, along with other cast members including Steve Zahn, Amy Sedaris, Don Knotts, Katie Finneran, and Garry Marshall.

Marshall was asked to provide a voice for &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;, which was re-conceived into &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and directed by Dindal, but was removed from the project for being &quot;too New York&quot;. When he was approached to provide the voice for Buck Cluck, Marshall claimed &quot;I said I don&#x27;t do voices. You want a chicken that talks like me, fine. So they hired me and they didn&#x27;t fire me, and it was like a closure on animation.&quot;. Before Marshall was cast, James Earl Jones, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Willem Dafoe were previously considered for the role of Buck Cluck.

Australian comedian Mark Mitchell was hired to dub the voice of Buck Cluck for the Australian release of the film, as a decision by Disney to get a national celebrity to publicize the film.

===Animation===
To visualize this story, Disney selected 50 percent of its 2D animation staff to put them in a CGI animation team, and placed them through a rigorous eighteen-month training program with George Lucas&#x27; Industrial Light and Magic, which included an introductory to Alias&#x27;s Maya that would serve as the main 3D animation software used on the project. This was due to Disney CEO Michael Eisner announcing that the studio would move to computer animation in response to a downturn caused by rising competition from Pixar and DreamWorks Animation computer animated features, as well as the unsatisfactory box office performances of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, &quot;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&quot;, &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002), and &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004). As some of the animators had worked on &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000), which used live-action backgrounds, the animation team took inspiration for its staging, coloring, and theatrical lighting from Mary Blair&#x27;s background designs featured in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951) and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953).

For the aesthetics in the background designs, the background layout artists sparingly use digital matte paintings to render out the naturalistic elements, including the trees and the baseball diamond, but they were retouched using Adobe Photoshop as background cards featured in the film. The lighting department would utilize the &quot;Lumiere&quot; software to enhance virtual lighting for the shading form and depth and geometric rendering for the characters&#x27; shadows, as well as use real lighting to create cucaloris.

For the characters&#x27; designs and animation style, Dindal sought to capture the &quot;roundness&quot; as seen in the Disney animated works from the 1940s to 1950s, by which the characters&#x27; fluidity of motion was inspired from the Goofy cartoon &quot;How to Play Baseball&quot; (1942). Under visual effects supervisor Steve Goldberg who spearheaded the department, the Maya software included the software program &quot;Shelf Control&quot; that provided an outline of characters that can be viewed on-screen and provided a direct link to the controls for specific autonomy, as well as new electronic tablet screens were produced that allowed for the artists to draw digital sketches of the characters to rough out their movements, which was then transferred to the 3D characters.

All of the characters were constructed using geometric polygons. For the title character, there were approximately fourteen to fifteen character designs before settling the design composed of an ovular egghead shape with oversized glasses. The final character was constructed of 5,600 polygons, 700 muscles, and more than 76,000 individual feathers, of which 55,000 are placed on his head.

Following the casting of Braff, supervising animator Jason Ryan adapted Braff&#x27;s facial features during recording sessions to better combine the dorkiness and adorability the filmmakers desired. &quot;He&#x27;s got this really appealing face and eye expressions,&quot; Ryan said, adding that he was amazed by Braff&#x27;s natural vocal abilities. Next, the animators would utilize the software program &quot;Chicken Wire&quot;, where digital wire deformers were provided for the animators to manipulate the basic geometric shapes to get their desired facial features. Lastly, a software development team constructed XGen, a computer software program for grooming fur, feathers, and generating leaves.

==Release==
The film was originally scheduled for release on July 1, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was pushed back to November 4, 2005, the release date that was originally slated for Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot;. The release date change was also the day before DreamWorks Animation changed the release date of &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, from November 2006 to May 2007. &quot;Cars&quot; was later released on June 9, 2006.

At the time of the release of &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, the co-production deal between Disney and Pixar was set to expire with the release of &quot;Cars&quot; in 2006. The result of the contentious negotiations between Disney and Pixar was viewed to depend heavily on how &quot;Chicken Little&quot; performed at the box office. If successful, the film would have given Disney leverage in its negotiations for a new contract to distribute Pixar&#x27;s films. A failure would have allowed Pixar to argue that Disney could not produce CGI films.

On October 30, 2005, the film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre, with the cast and filmmakers as attendees, which was followed with a ballroom bash at the Hollywood and Highland Center. Along with its standard theatrical release, the film was the first Disney in-house release to be rendered in Disney Digital 3D, that was produced by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and exhibited via Dolby Digital Cinema servers at approximately 100 selected theaters in twenty five top markets. To describe the process, Dindal remembers that it was a last minute decision, as it was suggested just 11 months before its release. For the 3D conversion, Dindal had a specific way he wanted the film to look: he wanted it to feel like a moving View-Master. As he puts it,

===Marketing===
The first trailer was released online in early 2004. It was also attached to the DVD release of &quot;Brother Bear&quot;. Accompanied with the theatrical release, Disney Consumer Products released a series of plush items, toys, activity sets, keepsakes, and apparel.

===Home media===
&quot;Chicken Little&quot; was first released on DVD on March 21, 2006, in a single disc edition. The DVD contained the film accompanied with deleted scenes, three alternate openings, a 6 part making-of featurette, an interactive game, a karaoke sing along, two music videos, and animation test footage of the female Chicken Little. The DVD sold over 2.7 million DVD units during its first week accumulating $48 million in consumer spending. Overall, consumer spending on its initial home video release grossed $142.6 million. The film was released for the first time on Blu-ray on March 20, 2007, and contained new features not included on the DVD. A 3D Blu-ray version was released on November 8, 2011.

A VHS version was also released as a Disney Movie Club exclusive, presented in a rare fullscreen aspect ratio.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend, &quot;Chicken Little&quot; grossed $40 million and debuted at #1, being the first Disney animated film to do so since &quot;Dinosaur&quot;. It also managed to claim #1 again in its second week of release, earning $31.7 million, beating Sony&#x27;s sci-fi family film, &quot;Zathura&quot;. The film grossed $135.4 million in North America, and $179 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $314.4 million.

This reversed the slump that the company had been facing since 2000, during which time it released several films that underperformed, most notably &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; (1999), &quot;&quot; (2001), &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002), and &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004).

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes, reports that of surveyed critics gave positive reviews; the average score is . The critical consensus states: &quot;Disney expends more effort in the technical presentation than in crafting an original storyline.&quot; Metacritic, gave the film an average score of 48 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

James Berardinelli, writing his review for &quot;ReelViews&quot;, gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four stating that &quot;It is bogged down by many of the problems that have plagued Disney&#x27;s recent traditional animated features: anonymous voice work, poor plot structure, and the mistaken belief that the Disney brand will elevate anything to a &quot;must-see&quot; level for viewers starved for family-friendly fare.&quot; On the syndicated television program &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, critics Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert gave the film &quot;Two Thumbs Down&quot; with the former saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care whether the film is 2-D, 3-D, CGI, or hand-drawn, it all goes back to the story.&quot;

In his print review featured in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert stated the problem was the story and wrote, &quot;As a general rule, if a movie is not about baseball or space aliens, and you have to use them, anyway, you should have started with a better premise.&quot; Ebert concluded his review with, &quot;The movie did make me smile. It didn&#x27;t make me laugh, and it didn&#x27;t involve my emotions, or the higher regions of my intellect, for that matter. It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable feature cartoon for kids up to a certain age, but it doesn&#x27;t have the universal appeal of some of the best recent animation.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic A.O. Scott stated the film is &quot;a hectic, uninspired pastiche of catchphrases and clichés, with very little wit, inspiration or originality to bring its frantically moving images to genuine life.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; film reviewer Lisa Schwarzbaum, who graded the film a C, wrote that the &quot;banality of the acorns dropped in this particular endeavor, another in a new breed of mass-market comedy that substitutes self-reference for original wit and pop songs for emotional content.&quot;

However, Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; gave the film a positive review saying the film was &quot;shiny and peppy, with some solid laughs and dandy vocal performances&quot;. Olly Richards of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film a three out of five stars, saying, &quot;Beyond a cheeky, twisty bit of genre-tinkering, there&#x27;s more here for the under-tens than over-, but it&#x27;s still charming, amusing and energetic enough to win you over.&quot;

Angel Cohn of &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film three stars alluding the film that would &quot;delight younger children with its bright colors and constant chaos, while adults are likely to be charmed by the witty banter, subtle one-liners, and a sweet father-son relationship.&quot; Peter Rainer, writing in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, graded the film with an A− applauding that the &quot;visuals are irrepressibly witty and so is the script, which morphs from the classic fable into a spoof on &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. I prefer this version to Spielberg&#x27;s.&quot;

&quot;Plugged In&quot; wrote, &quot;A postscript for parents: A single &quot;mistake&quot; defines Chicken Little, and he spends &quot;the rest of his life&quot; trying to live it down. As he puts it, &quot;One moment destroyed my life.&quot; Later, another single moment—his home run—redefines him as a hero to his friends and his dad, who says, &quot;I guess that puts the whole &#x27;sky is falling&#x27; incident behind us once and for all.&quot; Insecure (and observant) young viewers may latch on to this kind of oversimplification and use it as license to magnify the significance of their own bumblings, whatever they might be.&quot; Common Sense Media gave the film a three out of five stars, writing, &quot;Cute, sometimes-frantic movie has peril, potential scares.&quot;

In 2020, Dindal expressed regret over the final version of the film:

===Accolades===
At the 2005 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, this film won the award for Worst Animated Film. At the 33rd Annie Awards, it received four nominations for Best Animated Feature, Best Animated Effects, Best Character Design, and Best Production Design, losing all to &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;. At the 2006 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, it was nominated for Favorite Animated Movie, but lost to &quot;Madagascar&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack album contains an original score composed and produced by John Debney, who had previously worked with Dindal on &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; (2000), with music by a wide range of artists, some musical veterans, such as Patti LaBelle and Diana Ross, as well as others. Uniquely for a Disney animated film, several of the songs are covers of classic popular songs, such as Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, Carole King&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, and the Spice Girls&#x27; signature hit &quot;Wannabe&quot;. However, the film does include one original song, &quot;One Little Slip&quot; by Barenaked Ladies. The soundtrack was released on November 1, 2005, by Walt Disney Records.

==Video games==
&quot;Chicken Little&quot; spawned two video games. The first, &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, is an action-adventure game released for Xbox on October 18, 2005, by Buena Vista Games. Two days later it was released for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Game Boy Advance (October 20, 2005), and later Microsoft Windows (November 2, 2005). &quot;Chicken Little&quot; for Game Boy Advance was developed by A2M, while BVG&#x27;s recently acquired development studio, Avalanche Software, developed the game for the consoles.

The second video game, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Chicken Little: Ace in Action&quot;, is a multi-platform video game, for the Wii, Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 2 inspired by the &quot;superhero movie within the movie&quot; finale of the film. It features Ace, the superhero alter ego of Chicken Little, and the Hollywood versions of his misfit band of friends: Runt, Abby, and Fish-Out-of-Water.

Chicken Little appears as a summon in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; debuted before the film&#x27;s release in Japan, with the character&#x27;s inclusion serving as a promotion for the then-upcoming movie.

==Cancelled franchise==
Disneytoon Studios originally planned to make a direct-to-video sequel to&quot; Chicken Little&quot;, tentatively titled &quot;Chicken Little 2: The Ugly Duckling Story&quot;. Directed by Klay Hall, the story would have involved Chicken Little getting into a love triangle between Abby Mallard and a beautiful newcomer, Raffaela, a French sheep. Being at a great disadvantage, Abby would go to great lengths to give herself a makeover. According to Tod Carter, a story artist on the film, early screenings of the story reel were very well-received, prompting Disney to consider increasing the production budget to match the quality of the story. Soon after 2006, when John Lasseter became Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; new chief creative officer, he cancelled all sequels that were in development at Disneytoon, including &quot;Chicken Little 2&quot;, &quot;Meet the Robinsons 2: First Date&quot; and a sequel to &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, and ordered the studio to shift its focus towards spin-off films and original productions. According to Carter, this was a reaction to the sales figures for current projects and the overall market, adding: &quot;The executives didn&#x27;t feel that the original film had a wide enough market to draw upon to support the sequel.&quot;

Walt Disney Television Animation was also developing an animated series based on the film for Disney Channel. The project was passed in favor of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; according to Dan Povenmire. An animation test for the series was found in 2024.

<text>Spectral signature is the variation of reflectance or emittance of a material with respect to wavelengths (i.e., reflectance/emittance as a function of wavelength). The spectral signature of stars indicates the composition of the stellar atmosphere. The spectral signature of an object is a function of the incidental EM wavelength and material interaction with that section of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

The measurements can be made with various instruments, including a task specific spectrometer, although the most common method is separation of the red, green, blue and near infrared portion of the EM spectrum as acquired by digital cameras. Calibrating spectral signatures under specific illumination are collected in order to apply a correction to airborne or satellite imagery digital images.

The user of one kind of spectroscope looks through it at a tube of ionized gas. The user sees specific lines of colour falling on a graduated scale. Each substance will have its own unique pattern of spectral lines.

Most remote sensing applications process digital images to extract spectral signatures at each pixel and use them to divide the image in groups of similar pixels (segmentation) using different approaches. As a last step, they assign a class to each group (classification) by comparing with known spectral signatures. Depending on pixel resolution, a pixel can represent many spectral signature &quot;mixed&quot; together - that is why much remote sensing analysis is done to &quot;unmix mixtures&quot;. Ultimately correct matching of spectral signature recorded by image pixel with spectral signature of existing elements leads to accurate classification in remote sensing.

<text>HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (R81) (Dutch: Hr.Ms. &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (R81)) was a of the Royal Netherlands Navy. Formerly the British ship , she was sold to the Netherlands in 1948 as a light attack carrier. In 1960, she was involved in the decolonization conflict in Dutch New Guinea with Indonesia. In the mid 1960s, her role was changed to anti-submarine warfare carrier and only ASW aircraft and helicopters were carried. An engine room fire took her out of service in 1968. She was sold to Argentina in 1969 and renamed .

==Purchase==

Built at Cammell Laird in Birkenhead on 3 December 1942, &quot;Venerable&quot; was launched just over a year later and commissioned on 17 January 1945.

In 1948, &quot;Venerable&quot;″s short career in the Royal Navy came to an end when she was sold to the Netherlands and recommissioned as HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;, replacing a smaller of the same name while in Dutch service.

In 1955-58 she was rebuilt with an 8° angled flight deck, new elevators, new island, 40 mm anti-aircraft guns, steam catapult, and all new aviation facilities and electronics were fitted, including a Dutch-built new radar. At the same time, a similar Dutch rebuild was done to her sister ship, the .

==Cruises==

&quot;Karel Doorman&quot;, frigate &quot;Johan Maurits van Nassau&quot;, and light cruiser &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot; made a voyage to the Netherlands Antilles on 2 January 1950. Embarked on &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was Prince Bernhard. The ships returned to the Netherlands on 4 May.

In 1954, during a North American cruise, she visited Montreal, Quebec, Canada for an air show appearance.

Early in 1959 the ship made a trip to the United States (Newport, Rhode Island and Fort Lauderdale, Florida) and then continued on to visit the Antilles again.

In 1960, during the Dutch decolonization and planned independence of Western New Guinea, a territory which was also claimed by Indonesia, &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; set sail along with two destroyers and a modified oil tanker to &quot;show the flag&quot;. In order to avoid possible problems with Indonesia&#x27;s ally Egypt at the Suez Canal, she instead sailed around the Horn of Africa. She arrived in Fremantle, Australia, where the local seamen&#x27;s union went on strike in sympathy with Indonesia; the crew used the propeller thrust of aircraft chained down on deck to nudge the carrier into dock without tugs. In addition to her air wing, she was ferrying twelve Hawker Hunter fighters to bolster the local Dutch defence forces, which she delivered when she arrived at Hollandia, New Guinea. &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was also to have visited Yokohama, Japan during this Asian cruise to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the establishment of Japanese-Dutch diplomatic relations but, due to Indonesian and local protests, Japan withdrew its invitation.

After the 1964 refit, &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; served the rest of her career mostly conducting NATO anti-submarine patrols in the north Atlantic, no longer carrying strike or fighter aircraft as part of her regular air wing. &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; also regularly conducted various exercises near Scotland during her career.

===Western New Guinea Crisis===
During the 1960 crisis, Indonesia prepared for a military action named Operation Trikora. For an invasion, the Indonesian Air Forces (TNI-AU) hoped to sink this aircraft carrier with Soviet-supplied Tupolev Tu-16KS-1 Badger naval bombers using AS-1 Kennel / KS-1 Kometa anti-ship missiles (six planes were intended for the attack on &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;). This bomber launched missile strike mission was cancelled because of the ceasefire between Indonesia and the Netherlands; this led to a Dutch withdrawal and United Nations temporary peacekeeping administration followed by handover of Western New Guinea to Indonesia.

==Decommissioning==

In 1964, following the settlement of issues threatening its former colonial territories and changes in the mission for the Royal Netherlands Navy within NATO, coupled with the huge costs for operating and maintaining an aircraft carrier, it was decided to withdraw her from the operational fleet by the early 1970s. This was to coincide with the arrival of long range maritime patrol aircraft that were to take over the ASW role &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; had been tasked to perform ever since the start of the 1960s.

A boiler room fire on 26 April 1968 removed her from Dutch service. To repair the fire damage, new boilers were transplanted from the incomplete , at the Wilton-Fijenoord shipyard in Rotterdam. In 1969, it was decided that the costs for repairing the damage in relation to the relatively short time &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was still to serve in the fleet proved to be her undoing and she was sold to the Argentine Navy, renamed &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;, where she would later play a role in the 1982 Falklands War.

In the late 1960s, the NATO anti-submarine commitment was taken over by a squadron of Westland Wasp helicopters operated from six anti-submarine frigates and two squadrons of shore based maritime patrol aircraft. These were one squadron of Breguet Atlantique sea-reconnaissance aircraft and one of P-2 Neptunes.

==Air wing==

First deploying as an attack carrier with 24 World War II era propeller driven Fairey Firefly strike fighters and Hawker Sea Fury fighters, for sea rescue a Supermarine Sea Otter flying boat was carried, it was replaced by a Sikorsky S-51 helicopter.

From 1958, she operated with an ASW/Strike profile with up to 14 Grumman TBF Avenger ASW/torpedo bombers, 10 Hawker Sea Hawk fighters (a first generation naval jet fighter considered by the larger naval powers to be undersized and nearly obsolete at the time of delivery to the Dutch) and 2 Sikorsky S-55 ASW helicopters.

In 1960, the Royal Netherlands Navy received 17 Canadian built Grumman S-2 Tracker ASW aircraft formerly used by the Royal Canadian Navy. Changing roles to a dedicated NATO antisubmarine warfare carrier, a wing of 8 Grumman S-2 Trackers and 6 Sikorsky S-58 ASW helicopters served aboard from 1961 until the 1968 shipboard fire and removal from Dutch service.

From 1959, Dutch Sea Hawks were equipped with Sidewinder missiles that significantly enhanced and extended their air-to-air combat capabilities. While never engaged in combat, the aircraft were present as a carrier based deterrent during the 1962 New Guinea Indonesia crisis. They served aboard between 1957 and 1964 until &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;″s overhaul, after which the attack role was eliminated and 22 aircraft were transferred to land based reserve storage - they were all retired from service by the end of the 1960s after the sale of &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; to Argentina.

<doc id="1194091" wikidata="Q4386371" url="?curid=1194091" title="Dizocilpine">
<text>Dizocilpine (INN), also known as MK-801, is a pore blocker of the NMDA receptor, a glutamate receptor, discovered by a team at Merck in 1982. Glutamate is the brain&#x27;s primary excitatory neurotransmitter. The channel is normally blocked with a magnesium ion and requires depolarization of the neuron to remove the magnesium and allow the glutamate to open the channel, causing an influx of calcium, which then leads to subsequent depolarization. Dizocilpine binds inside the ion channel of the receptor at several of PCP&#x27;s binding sites thus preventing the flow of ions, including calcium (Ca2+), through the channel. Dizocilpine blocks NMDA receptors in a use- and voltage-dependent manner, since the channel must open for the drug to bind inside it. The drug acts as a potent anti-convulsant and probably has dissociative anesthetic properties, but it is not used clinically for this purpose because of the discovery of brain lesions, called Olney&#x27;s lesions (see below), in laboratory rats. Dizocilpine is also associated with a number of negative side effects, including cognitive disruption and psychotic-spectrum reactions. It inhibits the induction of long term potentiation and has been found to impair the acquisition of difficult, but not easy, learning tasks in rats and primates. Because of these effects of dizocilpine, the NMDA receptor pore blocker ketamine is used instead as a dissociative anesthetic in human medical procedures. While ketamine may also trigger temporary psychosis in certain individuals, its short half-life and lower potency make it a much safer clinical option. However, dizocilpine is the most frequently used uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist in animal models to mimic psychosis for experimental purposes.

Dizocilpine has also been found to act as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It has been shown to bind to and inhibit the serotonin and dopamine transporters as well.

== An animal model of schizophrenia ==
Dizocilpine has a great deal of potential to be used in research in creating animal models of schizophrenia. Unlike dopaminergic agonists, which mimic only the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, a single injection of dizocilpine was successful in modelling both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Another study found that, although repeated low doses of dizocilpine were only successful in mimicking behavioral changes such as a slight hyperlocomotion and decreased prepulse inhibition, repeated administration of a higher dose mimicked both the above changes as well as the neurochemical alterations found in first-episode schizophrenic patients. Not only has temporary use been shown to mimic psychosis but chronic administration in laboratory animals resulted in similar neuropathological changes as in schizophrenia.

== Possible future medical uses ==
The effects of dizocilpine at NMDA receptors are clear and significant. NMDA receptors are key in the progression of excitotoxicity (a process in which an excessive amount of extracellular glutamate overexcites glutamate receptors and harms neurons). Thus NMDA receptor antagonists including dizocilpine have been extensively studied for use in treatment of diseases with excitotoxic components, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington&#x27;s, Alzheimer&#x27;s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Dizocilpine has shown effectiveness in protecting neurons in cell culture and animal models of excitotoxic neurodegeneration. The administration of dizocilpine protected the hippocampus from ischemia-induced neurodegeneration in the gerbil. The ED50 (effective dose 50) for neuroprotection was 0.3 mg/kg and the majority of the animals were protected against the ischemia-induced damage at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg, when dizocilpine was given one hour prior to the occlusion of the carotid arteries, although other studies have shown protection up to 24 hours post-insult. Excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate and aspartate, are released in toxic amounts when the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen and NMDA antagonists are thought to prevent the neurodegeneration through the inhibition of these receptors.

Behavioural studies have shown that NMDA receptors are involved in the development of psychological dependence caused by chronic administration of morphine. Dizocilpine suppressed the morphine-induced rewarding effect. It is suggested that stimulating NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor and its associated kinases in the nucleus accumbens leads to the rewarding effect caused by morphine. Inhibition of this receptor and its kinases in the nucleus accumbens by co-treatment with NMDA antagonists prevents morphine-associated psychological dependence. An earlier study has shown that the prevention of morphine-associated psychological dependence was not due to state-dependency effects induced by dizocilpine but rather reflect the impairment of learning that is caused by NMDA antagonists. This is consistent with studies showing that dizocilpine potentiates the addictive potential of morphine and other drugs (see below).

As an antidepressant, positive results were found in animal models of depression. NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have been shown in animal models to attenuate the hearing loss caused by aminoglycosides It is thought that aminoglycosides mimic endogenous polyamines at NMDA receptors and produce excitotoxic damage, leading to hair cell loss. Antagonizing NMDA receptors to reduce the excitotoxicity would prevent that hearing loss. Dizocilpine was found to block the development of kindled seizures, although it does not have any effect on completed kindled seizures. Oddly, it was discovered to decrease rabies virus production and is believed to be the first neurotransmitter antagonist to present with antiviral activity. Rat cortical neuron cells were infected with the rabies virus and those incubated with dizocilpine had virus produced reduced about 1000-fold. It is not known how MK-801 has this effect; the rabies virus suspension, without cells, was inoculated with dizocilpine and the drug failed to produce a virucidal effect, indicated that the mechanism of action is something other than direct discontinuation of virus reproduction. It was also tested against herpes simplex, vesicular stomatitis, poliovirus type I, and HIV. It did not have activity against these other viruses, however. Dizocilpine was also shown to potentiate the ability of levodopa to ameliorate akinesia and muscular rigidity in a rodent model of parkinsonism. When dizocilpine was administered to rats 15 minutes after a spinal trauma, the long-term neurological recovery of the trauma was improved. However, NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have largely failed to show safety in clinical trials, possibly due to inhibition of NMDA receptor function that is necessary for normal neuronal function. Since dizocilpine is a particularly strong NMDA receptor antagonist, this drug is particularly likely to have psychotomimetic side effects (such as hallucinations) that result from NMDA receptor blockade. Dizocilpine had a promising future as a neuroprotective agent until neurotoxic-like effects, called Olney&#x27;s Lesions, were seen in certain brain regions of lab rats. Merck, a drug company, promptly dropped development of dizocilpine.

== Olney&#x27;s lesions ==

Dizocilpine, along with other NMDA antagonists, induce the formation of brain lesions first discovered by John W. Olney in 1989. Dizocilpine leads to the development of neuronal vacuolization in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex. Other neurons in the area expressed an abnormal amount of heat shock protein as well as increased glucose metabolism in response to NMDA antagonist exposure. Vacuoles began to form within 30 minutes of a subcutaneous dose of dizocilpine 1 mg/kg. Neurons in this area necrotized and were accompanied by a glial response involving astrocytes and microglia.

== Recreational use ==
Dizocilpine may be effective as a recreational drug. Little is known in this context about its effects, dosage, and risks. The high potency of dizocilpine makes its dosage more difficult to accurately control when compared to other similar drugs. As a result, the chances of overdosing are high. Users tend to report that the experience is not as enjoyable as other dissociative drugs, and it is often accompanied by strong auditory hallucinations. Also, dizocilpine is much longer-lasting than similar dissociative drugs such as ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP), and causes far worse amnesia and residual deficits in thinking, which have hindered its acceptance as a recreational drug.
Several animal studies have demonstrated the addictive potential of dizocilpine. Rats learned to lever-press in order to obtain injections of dizocilpine into the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex, however, when given a dopamine antagonist at the same time, the lever-pressing was not altered, which shows that the rewarding effect of dizocilpine is not dependent on dopamine. Intraperitoneal administration of dizocilpine also produced an enhancement in self-stimulation responding. Rhesus monkeys were trained to self-administer cocaine or phencyclidine, then were offered dizocilpine instead. None of the four monkeys who were used to cocaine chose to self-administer dizocilpine but three out of the four monkeys who had been using phencyclidine self-administered dizocilpine, suggesting again that dizocilpine has potential as a recreational drug for those seeking a dissociative anaesthetic type of experience. It was found that dizocilpine administration elicited conditioned place preference in animals, again demonstrating its reinforcing properties.

A multiple drug fatality involving dizocilpine, benzodiazepines, and alcohol has been reported.

Dizocilpine has been sold online as a designer drug.

<text>, known by his stage name Sakura, is a Japanese musician. He is best known as former drummer of the rock band L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel from 1993 to 1997. After leaving them he formed the supergroup Zigzo, the trio Sons of All Pussys, and his solo project Lion Heads. Currently Sakura performs with the bands Rayflower, the reformed Zigzo, The Madcap Laughs, and Gibkiy Gibkiy Gibkiy.

==Life and career==
Sakura was born in Nerima, Tokyo, the youngest of three children. He started taking piano lessons when he was a child. When he was in junior high school he became very interested in rock music, later taking formal music training. Initially he wanted to play guitar but soon changed his mind and devoted himself to percussion.

When Sakura was in high school, he was already playing in the percussion and brass sections for three different school bands. He started working as a roadie for well-known heavy metal band Dead End, when he was eighteen. Soon he began playing drums professionally and joined the visual kei bands Die+Kusse and the Harem Q. The latter released an album entitled &quot;Opium&quot; in 1991.

It was Dead End&#x27;s manager who gave L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel bassist Tetsuya Sakura&#x27;s contact information around December 1992. In 1993, Sakura joined pop rock band L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel. They released their debut album &quot;Dune&quot; soon afterward. In 1996, their fourth album &quot;True&quot;, became their first to sell over a million copies. But on February 24, 1997 Sakura was arrested for violating the Stimulants Control Law. In May, he received a two year prison sentence suspended for three years. Sakura officially announced his departure from L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel on November 4, 1997.

In 1999 he started the hard rock supergroup Zigzo with Tetsu and former By-Sexual members Ryo and Den. After achieving moderate commercial success, they disbanded in 2002. That same year, Sakura formed the band Sons of All Pussys with his ex-L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel bandmate Ken. He has also played drums for rock/pop band Tamamizu as support drummer during the first half of 2005. In July 2005 he formed his solo project Lion Heads, where he plays guitar under the alias &quot;Sakura-Die-Nerima&quot;.

In summer 2009 Sakura became drummer for Dead End frontman Morrie&#x27;s solo project Creature Creature. In 2009, he became the drummer for the rock band Rayflower, with Sophia keyboardist Keiichi Miyako. On May 15, 2010, he had his first show with the band Circuit9, in which he drums under the alias . In May 2011, Sakura reunited with Ryo and Den to restart By-Sex. They released a mini-album titled &quot;Ago&quot; on August 17 and had their first show two days later at the 2011 Chain the Rock Festival. On November 20, 2011, Sakura held a birthday concert at Shibuya O-West. There, after a surprise performance, Zigzo announced that they would officially restart activities at a concert on March 17, 2012 at Akasaka Blitz.

In May 2012, Sakura formed the trio The Madcap Laughs with aie from Deadman and Kiyoshi. Four years later he joined Gibkiy Gibkiy Gibkiy alongside aie, Kazuma (Merry Go Round) and kazu (Kagerou).

Sakura supported Malice Mizer in place of Kami, his former drum protégé who died in 1999, for two 25th anniversary performances on September 8 and 9, 2018. In tribute, he dressed up as Kami and used his original drum kit for the shows.

==Other work==
Sakura is a Pearl Drums, Sabian Cymbals and Remo drum-heads endorser, and has been giving drumming seminars at clinics since early on in his career. Pearl Instruments Japan released a special Sakura signature drumset model in 2003.

Sakura has authored two books, one called &quot;Sakura no Drumworks Quick Reference&quot; about drumming; and one part-biography part-fiction book called which gathers the articles published in the magazine &quot;Arena 37º&quot;, in his column , during his days in Zigzo. The latter was only available through mail order to customers living in Japan.

<doc id="1194115" wikidata="Q7874866" url="?curid=1194115" title="USS Trippe (1812)">
<text>USS &quot;Trippe&quot; was a sloop in the United States Navy during the War of 1812. She was named in honour of John Trippe.

Originally named &quot;Contractor&quot;, she was purchased by the Navy on the Niagara River in New York in 1812 — was converted to a warship by Henry Eckford of New York; renamed &quot;Trippe&quot;; and placed in commission soon thereafter, Lieutenant Thomas Holdup Stevens in command.

For a while, &quot;Trippe&quot; and her sister ships, fitted out on the Niagara River, were bottled up by British shore batteries at Fort George. However, Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s squadron joined the troops under Colonel Winfield Scott in a combined attack upon the fort, and it fell on 27 May 1813. The fall of Fort George forced the British to evacuate Fort Erie as well. With the river open, Chauncey&#x27;s ships began passage of the Niagara rapids on 6 June 1813 and, on the 19th joined Oliver Hazard Perry&#x27;s fleet at Erie, Pennsylvania.

&quot;Trippe&quot; and the rest of Perry&#x27;s squadron remained at Erie for another month. At first, the need for additional men to complete its crews kept the fleet in port. Later, a British blockade restricted its movement. However, the British were not exceedingly vigilant; and, on 4 August, &quot;Trippe&quot; and the other ships crossed the bar to leave Erie harbor. They remained near Erie until the 12th when they set sail for the western end of Lake Erie.

Perry established his operating base in Put-In-Bay at South Bass Island. That location afforded him excellent lines of communications with American forces to the south and put him within easy striking distance of Commodore Robert Barclay&#x27;s British fleet, based just inside the mouth of the Detroit River at Amherstburg.

For over a month, the British ships remained at their base under the protection of heavy shore batteries. However, Barclay had to order his ships out of the river in order that supplies might be delivered to British troops operating near the Detroit River. They weighed anchor on 9 September and departed Amherstburg. At sunrise the following morning, American lookouts sang out, &quot;Sail ho.&quot; Perry&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Trippe&quot;, cleared for action and headed out in the line of battle with flagship in the lead. Though they outnumbered the British nine ships to six, the Americans were outgunned 54 to 63.

By midday, the two forces opened fire. The British concentrated on the lead American ships, &quot;Lawrence&quot;, , and . Meanwhile, &quot;Trippe&quot; — stationed near the rear of the American force — fought a long range duel with and , battering &quot;Lady Prevost&quot; severely. The Britisher&#x27;s captain and her first lieutenant received serious wounds, and she herself, reduced to an unmanageable wreck, fell off to leeward. Perry&#x27;s flagship suffered similar damage, but he moved his flag to &quot;Niagara&quot; and ordered his ships forward, through the enemy line. &quot;Trippe&quot; charged ahead, firing furiously. The British resisted the American onslaught heroically, but—one by one—they struck their colors. When and &quot;Little Belt&quot; attempted to flee, &quot;Trippe&quot; and overhauled them and herded them back to their defeated fleet.

The Battle of Lake Erie, &quot;Trippe&quot;&#x27;s only action in the War of 1812, assured American control of Lake Erie and enabled American troops led by General William Henry Harrison to win a decisive victory in the Battle of the Thames. Throughout the remainder of her career, &quot;Trippe&quot; carried supplies to support General Harrison&#x27;s land operations. In October, the British attacked Buffalo at the east end of the lake and forced the Americans to evacuate the city. They found &quot;Trippe&quot; aground near Buffalo Creek and set fire to her. She and her cargo of supplies burned completely.

<text>An action axiom is an axiom that embodies a criterion for describing action. Action axioms are of the form &quot;If a condition holds, then the following will be done&quot;.

==On the action axiom==
Decision theory and, hence, decision analysis are based on the &quot;maximum expected utility&quot; (MEU) action axiom. In general, the principle for action embodied by an action axiom (such as MEU) is highly defensible and its scope very broad.

The action-axiom is the basis of praxeology in the Austrian School, and it is the proposition that all specimens of the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, the &quot;Homo agens&quot;, purposely utilize means over a period of time in order to achieve desired ends. In &quot;Human Action&quot;, Ludwig von Mises defined “action” in the sense of the action axiom by elucidating:

<text>Hell in the Pacific is a 1968 World War II film directed by John Boorman and starring Lee Marvin and Toshirō Mifune, the only two actors in the film. It is based on the importance of human contact and the bond that can form between enemies if lacking other contact.

==Plot==
Two World War II servicemen, one American and one Japanese, are stranded on an uninhabited Pacific island. The Japanese soldier suddenly discovers a military plane crash kit near his camp. The American, who survived the plane crash, watches him salvage the kit and confronts him on the beach. Both men have visions of getting beaten to death by the other, but in reality they only make aggressive gestures. The American notices that the Japanese has a small reservoir of drinking water and makes a dash to drink some, but is run off into the jungle. The Japanese sets fire to the jungle, smoking out the American. After chasing him off again, he wades out into the water to check his fishing trap. While his back is turned, the American makes another run for the drinking water, eventually stealing some and running off.

The next day, the American tries to steal more water, but is caught and falls on the reservoir, destroying it. After escaping, he destroys the fish trap, makes noises and plays tricks on the Japanese. After urinating on him from the cliff above, he is chased into the jungle by the infuriated Japanese, but collapses from dehydration. The Japanese takes him prisoner, binds his arms to a log and makes him walk back and forth in the sand. Eventually, the American escapes, surprises the Japanese and then binds him to the log and makes him walk back and forth in the sand. After getting frustrated trying to cook a meal, the American cuts the Japanese loose so that he can do the cooking. They cease hostilities and share chores and food from then on.

Later, the American notices the Japanese trying to build a raft. He scolds him for stealing &quot;his&quot; log to make the raft and for being sneaky about its construction. After observing what a poor attempt the raft is, he gets the idea that they should build a better one together. They argue over the design, but eventually work together and build a large raft. After setting sail and overcoming the strong waves of the reef, they hit open water.

Days later, they come upon a new set of islands, on one of which there appears to be an abandoned base. The Japanese takes the lead, since he recognizes it as a Japanese base. The American then spots American supplies and runs after him, imploring any soldiers who might hear to not fire because the Japanese is his &quot;friend&quot;. At one point, startled by running into his friend, the American exclaims in relief, &quot;for a moment there, I thought you were a Jap&quot;. Realizing that the base truly is abandoned, they rummage around for useful items and luxuries, eventually finding shaving supplies, a bottle of wine, cigarettes and an issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

That night, each seeing the other clean shaven for the first time, they drink sake together, sing songs and tell each other stories, despite the language barrier. Casually, the Japanese picks up and looks through a &quot;Life&quot; magazine and is horrified to see photos of dead and imprisoned Japanese soldiers. The American gets upset that the Japanese is not answering a question about whether the Japanese believe in God and the two angrily glare at one another, too upset to notice the increasingly loud sounds of the island being shelled. The Japanese stands up and walks a few paces away and the American gets up and kicks over the campfire. As the Japanese turns and walks back, a shell hits the building that they are in and destroys it.

==Cast==
* Lee Marvin as American Pilot
* Toshirō Mifune as Captain Tsuruhiko Kuroda

==Production notes==
The film contains little dialogue, and much like its predecessor – the film &quot;None but the Brave&quot; – is not dubbed or sub-titled, thus authentically portraying the frustration of restricted communication between the Japanese- and English-speaker. The film was entirely shot in the Rock Islands of Palau in the north Pacific Ocean, near the Philippines in the Philippine Sea.

The film was originally released with the actors walking away from one another. When it opened in Britain, the producers changed it with an abrupt ending by a random bomb hitting them both. Director John Boorman was surprised by that because he was not told of the change and said he &quot;hated it.&quot; He said it was rather cynical for them to have gone through everything just to be killed at the end. The ending with the bomb also was the version shown in Japan.

Both actors served for their respective countries during the Pacific War. Marvin, who was in the US Marines, was wounded and received the Purple Heart during the Battle of Saipan in 1944. Mifune served in the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service.

===Box office===
The film earned rentals of $1.33 million in North America and $1.9 million elsewhere. Because of the high costs involved, by 1973 the movie had recorded a loss of $4,115,000, making it one of the biggest money losers in the short history of ABC films.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 18 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.5/10. A.H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;[The film] grapples with the arresting relationships of character, communication and survival, but succeeds only fitfully in dramatically projecting these elemental qualities.&quot;

<text>Picrotoxin, also known as cocculin, is a poisonous crystalline plant compound. It was first isolated by the French pharmacist and chemist Pierre François Guillaume Boullay (1777–1869) in 1812. The name &quot;picrotoxin&quot; is a combination of the Greek words &quot;picros&quot; (bitter) and &quot;toxicon&quot; (poison). A mixture of two different compounds, picrotoxin occurs naturally in the fruit of the &quot;Anamirta cocculus&quot; plant, although it can also be synthesized chemically.

Due to its interactions with the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, picrotoxin acts as a stimulant and convulsant. It mainly impacts the central nervous system, causing seizures and respiratory paralysis in high enough doses.

==Chemical structure and synthesis==

Picrotoxin is an equimolar mixture of two compounds, picrotoxinin (C15H16O6; CAS# 17617-45-7) and picrotin (C15H18O7; CAS# 21416-53-5). Of the two compounds, picrotin is less active.

Picrotoxin occurs naturally in the fruit of the &quot;Anamirta cocculus&quot;, a climbing plant from India and other parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is known for its large stems of white wood and sweetly-scented flowers. It produces small stone fruits, &quot;Cocculus indicus&quot;, which are typically dried.

Currently, there are as many as five total syntheses of picrotoxinin — one of which was published as recently as June 2020. Most syntheses use carvone as a stereochemical template. 
In 1988, researchers from Tohoku University in Japan completed a total stereoselective synthesis of both ()picro­toxinin and beginning with (+)5βhydroxy­carvone. In this synthesis, eight asymmetric centers were stereo­selectively prepared on a &quot;cis&quot;-fused hydrindane ring system using several different reactions: a Claisen rearrangement to introduce the quaternary center, an organo­selenium-mediated reduction of an epoxy ketone, and a stereo­specific construction of a glycidic ester. 

The June 2020 synthesis instead employed the quick formation of the polycyclic core, followed by the manipulation of oxidation states of key carbon atoms in order to produce the target molecule. 

Some research suggests that picritoxin can be made by the cyclofunctionalization of cycloalkenyl systems. Under kinetically controlled conditions, this process generally results in &quot;exo&quot; cyclization and forms bridged ring systems like those found in picrotoxin. 

Several techniques have been developed to isolate picrotoxinin and picrotin individually. Reaction with the nearby &quot;cis&quot; alcohol is the key obstruction, and can be inhibited by pretreatment (protection) with trifluoroacetic anhydride in pyridine: 

Picrotoxin has also been used as a starting material in several synthetic processes, including the creation of &quot;dl&quot;-picrotoxadiene, which retains certain features of the picrotoxin skeleton.

==Mechanism of action==

Some crustacean muscle fibers have excitatory and inhibitory innervation. Picrotoxin blocks inhibition. Two different but related theories have been proposed for the mechanism by which picrotoxin acts on synapses. One theory is that it acts as a non-competitive channel blocker for GABAA receptor chloride channels, specifically the gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated chloride ionophore. A 2006 study found that, while not structurally similar to GABA, picrotoxin prevents ion flow through the chloride channels activated by GABA. It likely acts within the ion channels themselves, rather than at GABA recognition sites. Because it inhibits channels activated by GABA, GABA-enhancing drugs like barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be used as an antidote.

Other research suggests that the toxin acts instead as a non-competitive antagonist, or inhibitor, for GABA receptors. A study by Newland and Cull-Candy found that, in high enough concentrations, picrotoxin reduced the amplitude of GABA currents. Their data indicated that it was unlikely that picrotoxin acted simply as a voltage-gated channel blocker, although it did reduce the frequency of channel openings. Rather, they found that picrotoxin “binds preferentially to an agonist bound form of the receptor.” This means that, even in the presence of low concentrations of picrotoxin, the response of neurons to GABA is reduced.

==Toxicity==

Picrotoxin acts as a central nervous system and respiratory stimulant. It is extremely toxic to fish and humans, as well as rodents and other mammals. According to the Register of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances, the LDLo, or lowest reported lethal dose, is 0.357 mg/kg. Symptoms of picrotoxin poisoning include coughing, difficulty breathing, headache, dizziness, confusion, gastro-intestinal distress, nausea or vomiting, and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Although especially dangerous if swallowed, systemic effects can also result from inhalation or absorption into the blood stream through lesions in the skin. Picrotoxin also acts as a convulsant. In larger doses, it has been found to induce clonic seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias, with especially high doses ultimately proving fatal, typically due to respiratory paralysis.

==Clinical applications and other uses==

Due to its toxicity, picrotoxin is now most commonly used as a research tool. However, due to its antagonist effect on GABA receptors, it has been used as a central nervous system stimulant. It was also previously used as an antidote for poisoning by CNS depressants, especially barbiturates.

Although not commonly used, picrotoxin is effective as both a pesticide and a pediculicide. In the 19th century, it was used in the preparation of hard multum, which was added to beer to make it more intoxicating. This preparation has since been outlawed.

Despite its potential toxicity to mammals in large enough doses, picrotoxin is also sometimes used as a performance enhancer in horses. It is classified as an illegal &quot;Class I substance&quot; by the American Quarter Horse Association. Substances that are classified as “Class I” are likely to affect performance and have no therapeutic use in equine medicine. In 2010, quarter horse trainer Robert Dimitt was suspended after his horse, Stoli Signature, tested positive for the substance. As with humans, it is used to counteract barbiturate poisoning.

<text>The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was the title of Frank Aiken as a member of the Government of Ireland from 8 September 1939 to 18 June 1945 during The Emergency — the state of emergency in operation in Ireland during World War II. The Minister was intended to handle Civil Defence and related measures, allowing the Minister for Defence to concentrate on matters relating to the regular Army. The office was also responsible for handling wartime censorship.

Aiken was a minister without portfolio, as there was no Department of State corresponding to his brief, although there was an Office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939, which allows for ministers without portfolio, also allows such a minister to have a specific style or title. In fact, Aiken had been appointed on 8 September 1939, and the Act was passed on 21 December 1939, backdated to 8 September. The Minister for Supplies, who did have a corresponding Department of State, was established on the same dates. The section in the Act on ministers without portfolio was seen by Richard Mulcahy as designed to safeguard the legality of Aiken&#x27;s office.

Taoiseach Éamon de Valera explained the reasoning behind the ministry:
The Minister received functions delegated by other ministers, as provided for by section 6 of the Emergency Powers Act 1939. Aiken enforced stringent censorship of news, and of material potentially sympathetic to the Allies, in accordance with Ireland&#x27;s neutrality. He was also responsible for air raid precautions, delegated by the Minister for Defence. Seán Moylan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, served also as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.

In April 1941, Aiken went to the United States to ask President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military aid. Roosevelt told Aiken that Ireland should be supporting Britain, prompting Aiken to ask Roosevelt to seek guarantees from the British Government that the UK would not invade Ireland.

In 1943, Labour Party TDs William Davin and Timothy J. Murphy questioned the need for such a minister, and the vagueness of its responsibilities.

The ministry was abolished on 18 June 1945. The following day, Aiken was appointed Minister for Finance.

<doc id="1194138" wikidata="Q1060862" url="?curid=1194138" title="Ssese Islands">
<text>The Ssese Islands are an archipelago of eighty-four islands in the northwestern part of Lake Nalubaale in Uganda. The islands are coterminous with the Kalangala District in southern Central Uganda, which does not have any territory on mainland Uganda.

==Location==

The islands occupy the northwestern corner of Lake Nalubaale, the second-largest freshwater lake in the world. The largest island in the archipelago is called Bugala Island, which accounts for more than half the archipelago&#x27;s land area. Its largest town, called Kalangala serves as the headquarters of the district that carries the same name (Kalangala District). Kalangala is located approximately , across water, southwest of Entebbe, in Wakiso District, on the Ugandan mainland. The coordinates of the district are:0° 26&#x27; 0.00&quot;S, 32° 15&#x27; 0.00&quot;E (Latitude:-0.4333; Longitude:32.2500).

The islands lie in two main groups. The south west can be referred to as the Bugala Group, after Bugala Island, the largest in the archipelago. The northeastern group can be referred to as the Koome Group, after Koome Island, the largest in that group. The two groups are separated by the Koome Channel. Other islands in the Bugala Group include: Bubeke, Bubembe, Bufumira, Bugaba, Bukasa, Buyova, Funve and Serinya. The main islands in the Koome Group include: Damba, Koome and Luwaji.

== History ==
Little is known about the earliest inhabitants of Ssese, but some oral traditions associated with the creation of Buganda claim its founder Kintu hailed from the islands, or at least arrived in Buganda via them. The Baganda revere Ssese as the Islands of the Gods. In pre-colonial times it was customary for the Kings of Buganda to visit the islands and pay tribute to the several balubaale whose main shrines are situated there. These include shrines to Musisi (spirit of earthquakes) and Wanema (physical handicaps) on Bukasa Island, as well as the shrine of Mukasa (spirit of the lake), on Bubembe.

==Overview==
The Ssese Islands are inhabited by the Bantu speaking Bassese tribe, closely related to the Baganda and the Basoga, and speaking a similar, though distinct language. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the islands were one of the most important spiritual centers of the region. About 43 (50%) of the islands are inhabited. The islands vary in size from less than , to over in length for the largest island, Bugala Island.

Henry Morton Stanley described the inhabitants as &quot;the principal canoe builders and the greater number of the sailors of Mtesa&#x27;s empire.&quot;

==Travel==
The most popular route that the islands can be accessed from is through Nakiwogo near Entebbe by MV Kalangala as the main gateway to the archipelagos. Transfer between Nakiwogo and Bugala Island is usually 3½ hours.

From Bukakata: From the western part of Uganda, two free car ferries links Bukakata mainland located 36km east of Masaka with Luku on Bugala Island about 50 minutes sailing. The ferries sail from either directions every few hours from early morning at 7am to late evening at 6pm. The morning trips on Sunday are not available until 8am.

From Kasenyi landing site: To get to Banda Island, there are small wooden boats departing from Kasenyi, a fishing village 7 km off Entebbe-Kampala road; turn off is 5 km outside Entebbe.

On Bugala island there are shared taxis that run from Luku in land port to as far as mulabana at the extreme end of the island and nearby landing sites. Boda boda are also a popular means of transport on the island.

==Economic activity==
The principal industry in the Ssese Islands is fishing for the huge Nile Perch, with much of the catch being exported. Overfishing is a huge concern on these and other islands in Lake Victoria. Other industries include agriculture, forestry and tourism.

Livestock farming is practiced on the islands. It is estimated that 3,000 cattle, 250,000 poultry (chicken and ducks), 1,235 goats and 7,000 pigs are kept on the islands.

BIDCO, a private palm oil processor based in Jinja District, on the mainland, owns a palm oil plantation on the islands. In addition, outgrower farmers grow palm oil on contract with BIDCO and sell their produce to the processor. In 2010, the palm oil plant began generating 1.5MW of electricity through the burning of bagasse and some of the oil. The power supplies the oil processing plant and the excess is sold to Kalangala, the largest town on the islands.

Logging is another economic activity that is practiced on the Ssese Islands.

==Flora and fauna==

The islands are also home to a variety of animals including primates, which are not easily accessible on the mainland. The most common large terrestrial mammal is the Vervet monkey, which is often seen in the vicinity of Lutoboka and Kalangala. Bushbuck and black-and-white colobus are also present, but seldom observed. Since Buggala was separated from the mainland, one endemic creek rat and three endemic butterfly species have evolved on the island. Water and forest birds are prolific. There&#x27;s a variety of hornbills, barbets, turacos, robin-chats, flycatchers and weavers. Particularly common are the jewel-like pygmy kingfisher, the brown-throated wattle-eye and the paradise flycatcher. African fish eagles and palm-nut vultures are often seen near the lake, while immense breeding colonies of little egret and great cormorant occur on Lutoboka and other bays.

This has led to the evolution of a nascent but growing tourism industry on the islands. Infrastructure is still rudimentary but is slowly improving.

<text>The Covox Speech Thing is an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that plugs into the parallel printer port of a PC. It converts 8-bit digital sound using a simple R-2R resistor ladder into an analog signal output.

The Speech Thing was introduced on December 18, 1987 by Covox, Inc. of Eugene, Oregon, for about US$70 () and priced US$79.95 as of 1989. People soon started to build their own (DIY) variants, since its communication protocol and DAC is simple and only requires soldering a few cheap parts. The novelty of its patent &quot;Parallel port pass-through digital to analog converter&quot; (filed in 1987, granted in 1989) wasn&#x27;t specifically the use of a resistor ladder as a DAC, but rather the patent&#x27;s discussion is around its ease of plugging into the parallel port and how its resistor ladder design didn&#x27;t block other devices from using the parallel port. , as sound cards were still very expensive at that time. The plug was also quite popular in the demoscene.

An inherent problem of the design is that its quality relies on how precisely matched the resistors are (see ). If unmatched resistors are used, the resulting voltage levels get shuffled, especially for quiet sounds, resulting in distortion. Nevertheless, the sound quality of the Covox plug is far superior compared to the PC speaker; for some time, a self-built variant was an inexpensive way to give old computers sound capabilities.

== Features ==
The Covox plug received an 8-bit digital byte for each digital audio sample from the parallel port and produced a high impedance mono analog output voltage signal though a mini phone connector. That signal could then be amplified and played back on loudspeakers.

The resistances of the R-2R ladder (100 kΩ and 200 kΩ according to the patent) are deliberately high-enough to prevent excessive loading of the signals, so a printer attached to the output connector will operate normally. 

The original Covox plug itself doesn&#x27;t use sequential logic or a clock signal, so theoretically it can operate with any sampling rate. In practice, however, parallel port speed limits make it rather hard to achieve even standard 44100 Hz (the average 1980s 80286 system could handle sampling rates of 12 kHz, while later the faster 33 MHz 486SX introduced in 1991 could handle 44 kHz). 

Its 15 kΩ load resistor in parallel with a 5 nF capacitor after the R2R resistor ladder results in a passive RC low-pass filter starting around 3 kHz, thus limiting the analog bandwidth. Many DIY variants do not use the same ladder topology and component values, resulting in different timbre. 

Another limiting factor was that the CPU had to be interrupted at the sampling rate to play background audio (thus incurring the cost of a context switch for every sample, many thousands of times a second), since there was no data buffering or direct memory access available.

The sound quality can be increased by software through dithering, which reduces perceptible aliasing noise and increases dynamic range (used in Inertia Player and FastTracker 2 as an interpolating option).

== Commercial products ==
* Covox Speech Thing – a R-2R resistor DAC with parallel port pass through, bundled with speech synthesis software, marketed originally as part of voice synthesis and recognition system.

* Disney Sound Source – a different design to the Covox Speech Thing, though in a superficially similar case also with parallel pass through, marketed by Disney Software in early 1990s.
** Consists of a FIFO buffer with a DAC on the board that plugs into the parallel printer port, which transmits analog audio over a registered jack to a separate amplifier / speaker box. Its price was set to only $14 and it was supported by many games (see below). It used external power (9 volt battery) and could be turned on/off by software. Contrary to the Covox Speech Thing which had no FIFO buffer, the Disney Sound Source features a 16-byte FIFO allowing for autodetection and flow control, which clocks digital output to the resistive DAC at a fixed sample rate of 7 kHz ±5%.
** The printed circuit board DSS007C shows &quot;Ⓟ (1983) U.S. 4,384,170 and others&quot; which is an earlier patent by Forrest S. Mozer. The board a has one integrated circuit only (labeled &quot;ICS1453&quot;) and the schematic shows 8 lines from the parallel port going into one chip with input pins D0-D8 that also has a &quot;DAC output&quot; pin going to an output &quot;sound&quot;. So it can be inferred that that single chip implements both the FIFO and DAC internally, which differs dramatically from the passive R-2R design of the original Covox.
** In 2015 the hardware was reverse engineered so compatible circuits can be built from easily available off the shelf components. It is also emulated by the popular DOSBox emulator.

== Compatibility ==
===Games===
The Covox plug couldn&#x27;t directly substitute any of the popular cards of that age (AdLib, Sound Blaster, Gravis UltraSound, etc.), but several games / platforms supported it directly. It is also usually used in tandem with an AdLib sound card as said card officially was a music card and while it could be put into a mode to handle sampled audio, it could not play sampled audio and music at the same time. Notable entries include:
* &quot;688 Attack Sub&quot; – title music, sound effects
* &quot;Zorro&quot; – sound samples
* &quot;Battle Bugs&quot; – speech, requires expanded memory
* &quot;Star Control II&quot; – sounds 
* &quot;Covox Lemmings&quot; – special promotional edition of &quot;Lemmings&quot; released with Covox sound cards including special levels (only works with Covox sound cards for ISA Bus)
* &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot;
* most older Sierra Entertainment games, such as &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Space Quest&quot; series
* Build Engine games including &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot; and &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;

===Music trackers===
Popular DOS-based trackers used in the demoscene included Covox support, for example:
* Modplay (also ModEdit, DMP, VP and other Mod players from early 1990s) (Up to 4 channel COVOX output or custom assembler routine for user device)
* Inertia Player (mono, stereo-on-1 covox, with dithering option).
* Multiplayer by DGS Italian Software Company
* Galaxy Music Player (can play MODs even on an Intel 8088)
* Scream Tracker version 2.3 direct support. Version 3.21 through virtual-soundblaster driver.
* FastTracker (mono, stereo, stereo-on-1 mode, with dithering).
* Impulse Tracker

===Emulating other soundcards===
Emulators exist that allow a physical Covox to appear as if it is another soundcard:
* Virtual SoundBlaster – can emulate Sound Blaster on Covox
* Covoxer – can emulate Tandy 1000/2000 music synthesizer
* TEMU – can emulate Tandy 1000/2000 music synthesizer and Disney Sound Source

=== Emulating Covox ===
The DOSBox and Fake86 emulators can emulate a virtual Covox (as Disney Sound Source) on machines without a physical Covox.

===Operating systems===
Several operating systems have an installable driver for Covox:
* Windows 3.1x, Windows 95, Windows 98
* Linux
** &quot;Alternate Sound Driver for Linux 2.x&quot; (pcsndrv) – supports a &quot;Mono DAC&quot; using one lp-port (parallel printer port) and a &quot;Stereo DAC&quot; using two lp-ports.
** covox-music-player – not a kernel driver, but rather a userspace program that outputs sound on modern Linux distros to the Covox via port-mapped I/O with the &quot;outb&quot; (output byte) instruction wrapper function (which can be called from user space).
* MenuetOS
* CSI-DOS

===Later variants===
* André LaMothe&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;Black Art of 3D Game Programming&quot; section &quot;Building Your Own Digital Sound Device-DIGIBLASTER&quot; – while not saying the word &quot;Covox&quot;, it does describe how to build a resistor ladder hardware device with a schematic that is essentially a clone of a Covox in stereo that plugs into two parallel printer ports, and describes DOS C code for driving it.
* Simple LPTsnd – also compatible with SoundJR and FTL sound adapters in addition to Covox Speech Thing, allowing more games to be played.
* CVX-4 – features DIP switches to select capacitor for the low-pass filter, to provide extra attenuation, and to bypass coupling capacitor.
* Disney Soundsource 2015 Remake – reverse-engineered from an original adapter.
** Allows software requiring the original Disney hardware to work without the need of any additional software emulators.
* Benedikt&#x27;s remakes:
** Generic 8 bit audio DAC – includes parallel-port pass-through for printer, with intention of being more similar to original Covox.
** Parallel Port Headphone DAC – replica of 1990s SiliconSoft SoundJr device that can drive headphones with power from the parallel port.
** Parallel port audio and joystick adapter – compatible with FTL Sound Adapter.
* ISA LPT DAC r0 – Dual-channel board that plugs into the ISA bus.
** Each channel uses an Analog Devices AD7524 8-bit latched DAC CMOS chip containing a precise integrated thin-film resistor network.

== Other Covox products ==

* Covox Voice Master – Earlier 1984 speech-synthesis board for the Commodore 64 which could playback 64 words stored in memory with BASIC instructions. Word capacity could be extended with disk or tape.
** Covox Voice Master Junior – Later cheaper ($39.95) variant that plugs into Atari joystick port and contains an electret microphone for recording sounds for playback or recognition and a speaker.

Also as described in a 1991 COVOX Company Profile:

* Covox Sound Master – 1984 for Apple II, 1989 for MS-DOS
* Covox Voice Master System II – 1990
* Covox MIDI Maestro – 1990
* Covox Sound Master II – 1990

<text>Slow sand filters are used in water purification for treating raw water to produce a potable product. They are typically deep, can be rectangular or cylindrical in cross section and are used primarily to treat surface water. The length and breadth of the tanks are determined by the flow rate desired for the filters, which typically have a loading rate of per square metre per hour.

Slow sand filters differ from all other filters used to treat drinking water in that they work by using a complex biofilm that grows naturally on the surface of the sand. The sand itself does not perform any filtration function but simply acts as a substrate, unlike its counterparts for ultraviolet and pressurized treatments. Although they are often preferred technology in many developing countries because of their low energy requirements and robust performance, they are also used to treat water in some developed countries, such as the UK, where they are used to treat water supplied to London. Slow sand filters now are also being tested for pathogen control of nutrient solutions in hydroponic systems.

== History ==

The first documented use of sand filters to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in Paisley, Scotland, John Gibb, installed an experimental filter created by engineer Robert Thom, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer James Simpson for the Chelsea Waterworks Company in London in 1829. This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the United Kingdom in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician John Snow during the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant miasma theory that stated that diseases were caused by noxious &quot;bad airs&quot;. Although the germ theory of disease had not yet been developed, Snow&#x27;s observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay &quot;On the Mode of Communication of Cholera&quot; conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in Soho, with the use of a dot distribution map and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The Metropolis Water Act introduced the regulation of the water supply companies in London, including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act &quot;made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water&quot;, and required that all water be &quot;effectually filtered&quot; from 31 December 1855. This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across Europe. The Metropolitan Commission of Sewers was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the Thames were established above Teddington Lock.

Water treatment came to the United States in 1872 when Poughkeepsie, New York, opened the first slow sand filtration plant, dramatically reducing instances of cholera and typhoid fever which had been seriously impacting the local community. Poughkeepsie&#x27;s design criteria were used throughout the country as a model for other municipalities. Poughkeepsie&#x27;s original treatment facility operated continuously for 87 years before being replaced in 1959.

== Method of operation ==

Slow sand filters work through the formation of a gelatinous layer (or biofilm) called the hypogeal layer or &quot;Schmutzdecke&quot; in the top few millimetres of the fine sand layer. The &quot;Schmutzdecke&quot; is formed in the first 10–20 days of operation and consists of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, rotifera and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As an epigeal biofilm ages, more algae tend to develop and larger aquatic organisms may be present including some bryozoa, snails and Annelid worms. The surface biofilm is the layer that provides the effective purification in potable water treatment, the underlying sand providing the support medium for this biological treatment layer. As water passes through the hypogeal layer, particles of foreign matter are trapped in the mucilaginous matrix and soluble organic material is adsorbed. The contaminants are metabolised by the bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The water produced from an exemplary slow sand filter is of excellent quality with 90–99% bacterial cell count reduction. Typically, in the UK slow sand filters have a bed depth of 0.3 to 0.6 metres comprising 0.2 to 0.4 mm sand. The throughput is 0.25 m/h.

Slow sand filters slowly lose their performance as the biofilm thickens and thereby reduces the rate of flow through the filter. Eventually, it is necessary to refurbish the filter. Two methods are commonly used to do this. In the first, the top few millimetres of fine sand is scraped off to expose a new layer of clean sand. Water is then decanted back into the filter and re-circulated for a few hours to allow a new biofilm to develop. The filter is then filled to full volume and brought back into service. The second method, sometimes called wet harrowing, involves lowering the water level to just above the hypogeal layer, stirring the sand; thus precipitating any solids held in that layer and allowing the remaining water to wash through the sand. The filter column is then filled to full capacity and brought back into service. Wet harrowing can allow the filter to be brought back into service more quickly.

== Features ==

Slow sand filters have a number of unique qualities:

# Unlike other filtration methods, slow sand filters use biological processes to clean the water, and are non-pressurized systems. Slow sand filters do not require chemicals or electricity to operate.
# Cleaning is traditionally done by use of a mechanical scraper, which is usually driven into the filter bed once the bed has been dried out. However, some slow sand filter operators use a method called &quot;wet harrowing&quot;, where the sand is scraped while still under water, and the water used for cleaning is drained to waste.
# For municipal systems there usually is a certain degree of redundancy, since it is desirable for the maximum required throughput of water to be achievable with one or more beds out of service.
# Slow sand filters require relatively low turbidity levels to operate efficiently. In summer conditions with high microbial activity and in conditions when the raw water is turbid, blinding of the filters due to bioclogging occurs more quickly and pre-treatment is recommended.
# Unlike other water filtration technologies that produce water on demand, slow sand filters produce water at a slow, constant flow rate and are usually used in conjunction with a storage tank for peak usage. This slow rate is necessary for healthy development of the biological processes in the filter.

While many municipal water treatment works will have 12 or more beds in use at any one time, smaller communities or households may only have one or two filter beds.

In the base of each bed is a series of herringbone drains that are covered with a layer of pebbles which in turn is covered with coarse gravel. Further layers of sand are placed on top followed by a thick layer of fine sand. The whole depth of filter material may be more than 1 metre in depth, the majority of which will be fine sand material. On top of the sand bed sits a supernatant layer of unpurified water.

== Advantages ==

* As they require little or no mechanical power, chemicals or replaceable parts, and they require minimal operator training and only periodic maintenance, they are often an appropriate technology for poor and isolated areas.
* Slow sand filters, due to their simple design, may be created DIY. DIY-slow sand filters have been used by organisations like Tearfund in Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries to aid the poor.
* Slow sand filters are recognized by the World Health Organization, Oxfam, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency as being a superior technology for the treatment of surface water sources in small water systems. According to the World Health Organization, &quot;Under suitable circumstances, slow sand filtration may be not only the cheapest and simplest but also the most efficient method of water treatment.&quot;

== Disadvantages ==

* Due to the low filtration rate, slow sand filters require extensive land area for a large municipal system. Many municipal systems in the U.S. initially used slow sand filters, but as cities have grown, and because of their need to treat high-turbidity source waters, they subsequently installed rapid sand filters, due to increased demand for drinking water.

<doc id="1194146" wikidata="Q372765" url="?curid=1194146" title="Credit rating">
<text>A credit rating is an evaluation of the credit risk of a prospective debtor (an individual, a business, company or a government). It is the practice of predicting or forecasting the ability of a supposed debtor to pay back the debt or default. The credit rating represents an evaluation from a credit rating agency of the qualitative and quantitative information for the prospective debtor, including information provided by the prospective debtor and other non-public information obtained by the credit rating agency&#x27;s analysts.

Credit reporting (or credit score) is a subset of credit rating. It is a numeric evaluation of an &quot;individual&#x27;s&quot; credit worthiness, which is done by a credit bureau or consumer credit reporting agency.

==Sovereign credit ratings==

A sovereign credit rating is the credit rating of a sovereign entity, such as a national government. The sovereign credit rating indicates the risk level of the investing environment of a country and is used by investors when looking to invest in particular jurisdictions, and also takes into account political risk.

The &quot;country risk rankings&quot; table shows the ten least-risky countries for investment . Ratings are further broken down into components including political risk, economic risk. Euromoney&#x27;s bi-annual country risk index monitors the political and economic stability of 185 sovereign countries, with Singapore emerging as the least risky country since 2017 – it is also one of the only few countries in the world as well as the only in Asia to achieve a AAA sovereign credit rankings from all major credit agencies. 

Results focus foremost on economics, specifically sovereign default risk or payment default risk for exporters (also known as a trade credit risk). A. M. Best defines &quot;country risk&quot; as the risk that country-specific factors could adversely affect an insurer&#x27;s ability to meet its financial obligations.

==Short and long-term ratings==
A rating expresses the likelihood that the rated party will go into default within a given time horizon. In general, a time horizon of one year or under is considered short term, and anything above that is considered long term. In the past institutional investors preferred to consider long-term ratings. Nowadays, short-term ratings are commonly used.

==Corporate credit ratings==

Credit ratings can address a corporation&#x27;s financial instruments i.e. debt security such as a bond, but also the corporations itself. Ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies, the largest of which are Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, Moody&#x27;s and Fitch Ratings. They use letter designations such as A, B, C. Higher grades are intended to represent a lower probability of default.

Agencies do not attach a hard number of probability of default to each grade, preferring descriptive definitions such as: &quot;the obligor&#x27;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong,&quot; or &quot;less vulnerable to non-payment than other speculative issues…&quot; (Standard and Poors&#x27; definition of an AAA-rated and a BB-rated bond respectively). However, some studies have estimated the average risk and reward of bonds by rating. One study by Moody&#x27;s claimed that over a &quot;5-year time horizon&quot; bonds it gave its highest rating (Aaa) to had a &quot;cumulative default rate&quot; of 0.18%, the next highest (Aa2) 0.28%, the next (Baa2) 2.11%, 8.82% for the next (Ba2), and 31.24% for the lowest it studied (B2). (See &quot;Default rate&quot; in &quot;Estimated spreads and default rates by rating grade&quot; table to right.) Over a longer period, it stated &quot;the order is by and large, but not exactly, preserved&quot;.

Another study in &quot;Journal of Finance&quot; calculated the additional interest rate or &quot;spread&quot; corporate bonds pay over that of &quot;riskless&quot; US Treasury bonds, according to the bonds&#x27; rating. (See &quot;Basis point spread&quot; in table to right.) Looking at rated bonds for 1973–89, the authors found a AAA-rated bond paid 43 &quot;basis points&quot; (or 43/100 of a percentage point) over a US Treasury bond (so that it would yield 3.43% if the Treasury yielded 3.00%). A CCC-rated &quot;junk&quot; (or speculative) bond, on the other hand, paid over 7% (724 basis points) more than a Treasury bond on average over that period.

Different rating agencies may use variations of an alphabetical combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, with either plus or minus signs or numbers added to further fine-tune the rating (see colored chart). The Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s rating scale uses uppercase letters and pluses and minuses.
The Moody&#x27;s rating system uses numbers and lowercase letters as well as uppercase.

While Moody&#x27;s, S&amp;P and Fitch Ratings control approximately 95% of the credit ratings business, they are not the only rating agencies. DBRS&#x27;s long-term ratings scale is somewhat similar to Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and Fitch Ratings with the words high and low replacing the + and −. It goes as follows, from excellent to poor: AAA, AA (high), AA, AA (low), A (high), A, A (low), BBB (high), BBB, BBB (low), BB (high), BB, BB (low), B (high), B, B (low), CCC (high), CCC, CCC (low), CC (high), CC, CC (low), C (high), C, C (low) and D. The short-term ratings often map to long-term ratings though there is room for exceptions at the high or low side of each equivalent.

S&amp;P, Moody&#x27;s, Fitch and DBRS are the only four ratings agencies that are recognized by the European Central Bank (ECB) for determining collateral requirements for banks to borrow from the central bank. The ECB uses a first, best rule among the four agencies that have the designated ECAI status, which means that it takes the highest rating among the four agencies – S&amp;P, Moody&#x27;s, Fitch and DBRS – to determine haircuts and collateral requirements for borrowing. Ratings in Europe have been under close scrutiny, particularly the highest ratings given to countries like Spain, Ireland and Italy, because they affect how much banks can borrow against sovereign debt they hold.

A. M. Best rates from excellent to poor in the following manner: A++, A+, A, A−, B++, B+, B, B−, C++, C+, C, C−, D, E, F, and S. The CTRISKS rating system is as follows: CT3A, CT2A, CT1A, CT3B, CT2B, CT1B, CT3C, CT2C and CT1C. All these CTRISKS grades are mapped to one-year probability of default.

Under the EU Credit Rating Agency Regulation (CRAR), the European Banking Authority has developed a series of mapping tables that map ratings to the &quot;Credit Quality Steps&quot; (CQS) as set out in regulatory capital rules and map the CQS to short run and long run benchmark default rates. These are provided in the table below:

<text>The Solidaridad Network is an international civil society organisation founded in 1969. Its main objective is facilitating the development of socially responsible, ecologically sound and profitable supply chains. It operates through eight regional expertise centers in over 50 countries. 

==History==

The organization was founded in 1969.

In 1988, Solidaridad founded the Max Havelaar coffee label, considered the starting point for the Fairtrade movement. Having introduced Fairtrade coffee, Solidaridad went on to develop a similar scheme for bananas in 1996. In the 1990s, Solidaridad broadened its scope toward working with companies in corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes and certification. Moving forward, the organization focused further on working with producers in international supply chains by supporting round tables for commodities such as coffee, livestock, soy, cocoa, cotton, livestock, dairy, tea, textiles, sugarcane, fruit &amp; vegetables, gold, textiles, palm oil, and aquaculture.

In 2016, Solidaridad launched a five-year strategic plan focussed on four thematic areas- robust infrastructure, good practices, sustainable landscapes and enabling policy environments.

In 2018, Solidaridad won the Arrell Global Food Innovation Award.

In 2017, Solidaridad launched the Sustainable Cotton Ranking Index with the World Wildlife Fund and Pesticide Action Network UK. This analyzed the performance of 75 companies and their sustainable cotton uptake. The report revealed that the majority of brands are not doing enough to increase their sustainable cotton use.

===Soy===

Solidaridad is one of the founders and board members of the Round Table on Responsible Soy. In 2017, Solidaridad carried out a project that led to the certification of 30,125 tons of soybeans produced by 18 small and medium-scale farmers in the region of Silvânia and Orizona, Goias. This was the first time small and medium-scale soy growers in Goias, Brazil have been able to receive certification from the Round Table on Responsible Soy.

===Gold===

Solidaridad assists small-scale gold mines to reduce their environmental impact. In Ghana, Solidaridad helps miners to implement mercury-free technologies. In 2016, the first mine in Africa to reach Fairtrade certification, Syanyonja Artisan Miners&#x27; Alliance in Uganda, was a partner of a Solidaridad partnership with Fairtrade Foundation in East Africa.

===Palm Oil===

Solidaridad promotes better land-use planning to meet the growing demand for palm oil. In 2014, Solidaridad launched the Sustainable West Africa Palm Oil Programme (SWAPP).

In 2016, Henkel and BASF launched a collaboration with Solidaridad in Indonesia to train 5,500 smallholders implement good agricultural practices. The project spans an area of roughly 16,000 hectares.

<doc id="1194167" wikidata="Q5429324" url="?curid=1194167" title="Faerie faith">
<text>Faerie Faith is a Wiccan branch from the &quot;Old Dianic&quot; tradition (later renamed McFarland Dianic) through the work of Mark Roberts and his high priestess, Epona.

The Faerie Faith founded by Roberts and Epona is distinct from other Neopagan traditions with similar names: the Feri Tradition of Victor Anderson (circa 1960); the Radical Faeries group founded by gay men (1979); or the Faery Wicca of Kisma Stepanich (1998).

==History==
The history of the Faerie Faith begins with &quot;the Dallas Dianics,&quot; founded by Mark Roberts and Morgan McFarland in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area of Texas (in 1999, the name of the tradition was changed to the McFarland Dianic Tradition). McFarland, Roberts, and a third member together formed the Covenstead of Morrigana. According to the McFarland Dianic Homepage, &quot;It was Mark who pointed out to Morgan the reference to &quot;Dianic cults&quot; in Margaret Murray&#x27;s &quot;The Witch Cult in Western Europe&quot;. It spoke to their beliefs and practices, and they adopted the name &quot;Dianic&quot; for their tradition. Later that year, Mark and Morgan began creating rituals based on the Ogham. McFarland went on to initiate several high priestesses who hived off to start other covens. In 1979 she withdrew as high priestess, and now serves as matriarch and advisor to the Council of High Priestesses of the McFarland Dianic Tradition.

In 1979 Roberts moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he met a woman named Epona. Roberts taught her the lessons he had written while with McFarland, and Epona became a high priestess and the founder of the &quot;Eponian&quot; branch of the McFarland Dianics - what is now known as the Faerie Faith. Roberts most likely took the name for this new tradition from &quot;The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries&quot; by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, published in 1911. This book is an oral history and describes a variety of folk beliefs and practices, many still extant at the time the book was written.

Roberts returned to Dallas and started a new tradition, called Hyperborea. Epona continued to teach the Faerie Faith tradition she and Roberts developed, and today there are members of the Faerie Faith spread out across the Southeastern United States.

==Beliefs and practices==

The characteristic of Faerie Faith is the use of the Beth-Luis-Nion &quot;Celtic tree calendar&quot;, allegedly invented by Robert Graves in his book, &quot;The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth&quot;. The system is based on Graves&#x27;s re-interpretation of the Celtic ogham alphabet; however, scholars believe Graves&#x27;s invention is not based on any actual Celtic calendar. In the Faerie Faith, specific lessons are associated with each lunar month, and students experience personal transformation in connection to each tree/letter.

<doc id="1194169" wikidata="Q4386534" url="?curid=1194169" title="CNQX">
<text>CNQX or cyanquixaline (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) is a competitive AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist. Its chemical formula is C9H4N4O4. CNQX is often used in the retina to block the responses of OFF-bipolar cells for electrophysiology recordings.

CNQX is an antagonist of α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). A study of the effects of CNQX on vestibuloocular reflex adaptation was done on goldfish by injecting CNQX into the vestibulo-cerebullum. The injection before adaptation significantly decreased and at the highest doses, completely inhibited the acquisition of adaptive reflex gain increases and decreases during a three-hour training period. Baseline performance was not affected by the CNQX injections. Injections of CNQX at the end of the training period shows a rapid loss of gained vestibuloocular reflex adaptation when the goldfish remained stationary in the dark. Instead of injecting CNQX immediately after training, injection made one to two hours after the initiation of the training period showed no signs of altering performance. CNQX injections did not have long-term permanent effects on the goldfish&#x27;s ability to be retrained 48-hours later and was comparable to a control group that was not subjected to CNQX injections. CNQX did not inhibit adaptive changes while the injection was administered.

== Research applications ==
Excitatory synaptic transmission can be mediated through changing the responsiveness of AMPA receptors. One common method of altering responsiveness is changing the number of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane through endocytosis. Various stimuli, including CNQX, have diverse effects on AMPA receptor internalization. Known to be a competitive antagonist of the AMPA/kainate receptor, CNQX is used in studies investigating whether or not AMPA receptor endocytosis is ligand-dependent. In a culture of hippocampal neurons, CNQX partially inhibited AMPA receptor internalization that was stimulated by AMPA. However, when the hippocampal neurons were treated with CNQX alone, AMPA receptor internalization still took place in both the soma and dendrites. APV (NMDA receptor antagonist) or nimodipine (voltage gated calcium channel blocker) were also not able to block this internalization, suggesting that receptor activation is not a requirement for AMPA receptor endocytosis. The type of AMPA receptors endocytosed as a result of CNQX stimulation can also be identified using CNQX. In HEK cells tagged with GluR subunits, CNQX stimulates the internalization of GluR1 and GluR2 receptors. The intracellular region conserved in both GluR1 and GluR2 on the GluR2 C-terminal tail was identified and deleted. Deletion of this segment resulted in a decrease in constitutive endocytosis of the GluR2 receptor in HEK cells, pinpointing the sequence determining this effect.

CNQX is known to be a selective competitive antagonist for both AMPA receptors, which have an IC50 value of 400 nM, and kainate receptors, which have an IC50 value of 4 μM. It also noncompetitively inhibits NMDA receptors. CNQX is thus used to isolate GABAA receptor mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. The actions of CNQX on the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents are independent of their actions at ionotropic glutamate receptors. Although the EC50 value of CNQX on the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents is similar to the IC50 value on kainate receptors, the blockade of kainate receptors is not responsible for the actions of CNQX. NBQX is a quinoxaline derivative that is known to be more effective than CNQX in blocking kainate receptors, but there was not a large increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Additionally, CNQX&#x27;s effects were not replicated by kynurenate (glutamate receptor antagonist) or NS-102 (selective kainate receptor blocker) since there was no increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Furthermore, D-AP5 and 7-CIK did not affect the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, proving that the action of NMDA receptors do not account for the effects of CNQX.

<text>Rear-Admiral William Allen FRS (25 November 1792 – 23 January 1864) was an English naval officer and explorer.

==Biography==
Allen was born in Weymouth in November 1792. He entered the navy as a volunteer in 1805, and, as midshipman, was present at the passage of the Dardanelles in 1807. He was on board the 36-gun in August 1811 for the capture of Java, and in June 1813 during the successful attack on the pirate base at Sambas, Borneo.

Allen was promoted lieutenant in 1815, commander 1836, and captain 1842. He look part in the Niger expedition of Richard Lander and Oldfield, 1832; but is best known as having commanded the steamer in the elaborately equipped but disastrous Niger expedition of 1841 under Captain Henry Totter. Though Allen cannot be blamed for any of the misfortunes of this expedition, he was on his return placed on half-pay, and retired from the service, as rear-admiral, in 1862, dying at Weymouth 23 January 1864.

Allen collected the type specimen of Allen&#x27;s gallinule (a small waterbird) near the River Niger. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Works==
In 1848, Allen with Thomas Richard Heywood Thomson published, in two volumes as &quot;A Narrative of the Expedition sent by H.M.&#x27;s Government to the River Niger in 1841&quot;. In 1849 he travelled through Syria and Palestine, and published the results in two volumes (1855) as &quot;The Dead Sea, a New Route to India, with other Fragments and Gleanings in the East&quot;, in which he advocated the construction of a canal between the Mediterranean and Red Sea by the Jordan Valley and Dead Sea, and compared that route with the proposed Suez Canal.

In 1846, Allen published a pamphlet on &quot;Mutual Improvement&quot;, advocating the institution of good-conduct prizes to be awarded by ballot by the community divided for the purpose into small groups; and in 1849 a &quot;Plan for the immediate Extinction of the Slave Trade, for the Relief of the West India Colonies, and for the Diffusion of Civilisation and Christianity in Africa by the co-operation of Mammon with Philanthropy&quot;, a scheme of compulsory &quot;apprenticeship&quot; or &quot;temporary bondage&quot;. Allen also brought out two volumes of &quot;Picturesque Views&quot; on Ascension Island (1835) and the River Niger (1840), with papers in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Geographical Society&quot;, vols. vii. viii. xiii. and xxiii. Some of his landscape paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy, from 1828 to 1847.

<doc id="1194185" wikidata="Q545906" url="?curid=1194185" title="Mortgage-backed security">
<text>A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is a type of asset-backed security (an &quot;instrument&quot;) which is secured by a mortgage or collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that securitizes, or packages, the loans together into a security that investors can buy. Bonds securitizing mortgages are usually treated as a separate class, termed residential; another class is commercial, depending on whether the underlying asset is mortgages owned by borrowers or assets for commercial purposes ranging from office space to multi-dwelling buildings.

The structure of the MBS may be known as &quot;pass-through&quot;, where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

In the U.S. the MBS market has more than $11 trillion in outstanding securities and almost $300 billion in average daily trading volume.

A mortgage bond is a bond backed by a pool of mortgages on a real estate asset such as a house. More generally, bonds which are secured by the pledge of specific assets are called mortgage bonds. Mortgage bonds can pay interest in either monthly, quarterly or semiannual periods. The prevalence of mortgage bonds is commonly credited to Mike Vranos.

The shares of subprime MBSs issued by various structures, such as CMOs, are not identical but rather issued as tranches (French for &quot;slices&quot;), each with a different level of priority in the debt repayment stream, giving them different levels of risk and reward. Tranches of an MBS—especially the lower-priority, higher-interest tranches—are/were often further repackaged and resold as collateralized debt obligations. These subprime MBSs issued by investment banks were a major issue in the subprime mortgage crisis of 2006–2008.

The total face value of an MBS decreases over time, because like mortgages, and unlike bonds, and most other fixed-income securities, the principal in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value is measured by the MBS&#x27;s &quot;factor&quot;, the percentage of the original &quot;face&quot; that remains to be repaid.

In the United States, MBSs may be issued by structures set up by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or they can be &quot;private-label&quot;, issued by structures set up by investment banks.

==Securitization==
The process of securitization is complex and depends greatly on the jurisdiction within which the process is conducted. Among other things, securitization distributes risk and permits investors to choose different levels of investment and risk. The basics are:

# Mortgage loans (mortgage notes) are purchased from banks and other lenders, and possibly assigned to a special purpose vehicle (SPV).
# The purchaser or assignee assembles these loans into collections, or &quot;pools&quot;.
# The purchaser or assignee securitizes the pools by issuing mortgage-backed securities.

While a residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) is secured by single-family, one- to four-unit real estate, a commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) is secured by commercial and multi-family properties, such as apartment buildings, retail or office properties, hotels, schools, industrial properties, and other commercial sites. A CMBS is usually structured as a different type of security than an RMBS.

These securitization trusts may be structured by government-sponsored enterprises as well as by private entities that may offer credit enhancement features to mitigate the risk of prepayment and default associated with these mortgages. Since residential mortgage holders in the United States have the option to pay more than the required monthly payment (curtailment) or to pay off the loan in its entirety usually without financial penalty (prepayment), the monthly cash flow of an MBS is not known in advance, and an MBS therefore presents a risk to investors.

In the United States, the most common securitization trusts are sponsored by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, US government-sponsored enterprises. Ginnie Mae, a US government-sponsored enterprise backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, guarantees that its investors receive timely payments but buys limited numbers of mortgage notes. Some private institutions also securitize mortgages, known as &quot;private-label&quot; mortgage securities. Issuances of private-label mortgage-backed securities increased dramatically from 2001 to 2007 and then ended abruptly in 2008, when real estate markets began to falter. An example of a private-label issuer is the real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), a tax-structure entity usually used for CMOs; among other things, a REMIC structure avoids so-called double taxation.

===Advantages and disadvantages===
The securitization of mortgages in the 1970s had the advantage of providing more capital for housing at a time when the demographic bulge of baby boomers created a housing shortage and inflation was undermining a traditional source of housing funding, the savings and loan associations (or thrifts), which were limited to providing uncompetitive 5.75% interest rates on savings accounts and consequently losing savers&#x27; money to money market funds. Unlike the traditional localized, inefficient mortgage market where there might be a shortage or surplus of funds at any one time, MBSs were national and international in scope and regionally diversified. Mortgage-backed securities helped move interest rates out of the banking sector and facilitated greater specialization among financial institutions.

However, mortgage-backed securities may have &quot;led inexorably to the rise of the subprime industry&quot; and &quot;created hidden, systemic risks&quot;. They also &quot;undid the connection between borrowers and lenders&quot;. Historically, &quot;less than 2% of people lost their homes to foreclosure&quot;, but with securitization, &quot;once a lender sold a mortgage, it no longer had a stake in whether the borrower could make his or her payments.&quot;

==History==
Among the early examples of mortgage-backed securities in the United States were the slave mortgage bonds of the early 18th century and the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the mid-19th century which may have contributed to the panic of 1857. There was also an extensive commercial MBS market in the 1920s.

===US government===

In June 1933, the Glass–Steagall Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This legislative initiative separated commercial banking from investment banking, providing safeguards against possible corruption with many types of investment securities (like the MBS). Even though the fixed-rate mortgage did not yet exist at this time, the law deemed it illegal for a banking institution to both sponsor debts and design investment vehicles or market-making tools as the selfsame entity. In other words, the Mortgage-Backed Security could probably not have existed at this time (without a little tweaking of the laws).

As part of the New Deal following the Great Depression, the US federal government created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) with the National Housing Act of 1934 to assist in the construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of residential properties. The FHA helped develop and standardize the fixed-rate mortgage as an alternative to the balloon payment mortgage by insuring them, and helped the mortgage design garner usage.

In 1938, the government also created the government-sponsored corporation Fannie Mae to create a liquid secondary market in these mortgages and thereby free up the loan originators to originate more loans, primarily by buying FHA-insured mortgages. As part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, Fannie Mae was split into the current Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae to support the FHA-insured mortgages, as well as Veterans Administration (VA) and Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) insured mortgages, with the full faith and credit of the US government. In 1970, the federal government authorized Fannie Mae to purchase conventional mortgages—that is, those not insured by the FHA, VA, or FmHA, and created Freddie Mac to perform a role similar to that of Fannie Mae. Ginnie Mae does not invest in conventional mortgages.

===Securitization===
Ginnie Mae guaranteed the first mortgage pass-through security of an approved lender in 1968. In 1971, Freddie Mac issued its first mortgage pass-through, called a &quot;participation certificate&quot;, composed primarily of conventional mortgages. In 1981, Fannie Mae issued its first mortgage pass-through, called a &quot;mortgage-backed security&quot;. In 1983, Freddie Mac issued the first collateralized mortgage obligation.

In 1960 the government enacted the Real Estate Investment Trust Act to allow the creation of the real estate investment trust (REIT) to encourage real estate investment, and in 1977 Bank of America issued the first private label pass-through. In 1983 the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation T to allow broker-dealers to use pass-throughs as margin collateral, equivalent to over-the-counter non-convertible bonds. In 1984 the government passed the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act to improve the marketability of private label pass-throughs, which declared nationally recognized statistical rating organization AA-rated mortgage-backed securities to be legal investments equivalent to Treasury securities and other federal government bonds for federally chartered banks (such as federal savings banks and federal savings associations), state-chartered financial institutions (such as depository banks and insurance companies) unless overridden by state law before October 1991 (which 21 states did), and Department of Labor–regulated pension funds.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allowed the creation of the tax-exempt real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) special purpose vehicle for the express purpose of issuing pass-throughs. The Tax Reform Act may have contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s that resulted in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which dramatically changed the savings and loan industry and its federal regulation, encouraging loan origination.

Nevertheless, probably the most influential action that encouraged the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 (other than the neglectful actions of banking institutions) was the Financial Services Moderation Act (also called the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act). It was signed into law in 1999 by President Clinton, and allowed sole, in-house creation (by solitary banking institutions) of Mortgage-Backed Securities as investment and derivatives instruments. This legislative decision did not just tweak or finesse the preexisting law, it effectively repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the only remaining statutory safeguard poised against the ensuing disaster.

===Subprime mortgage crisis===

Low-quality mortgage-backed securities backed by subprime mortgages in the United States caused a crisis that played a major role in the 2007–08 global financial crisis. By 2012 the market for high-quality mortgage-backed securities had recovered and was a profit center for US banks.

==Types==
 Most bonds backed by mortgages are classified as an MBS. This can be confusing because a security derived from an MBS is also called an MBS. To distinguish the basic MBS bond from other mortgage-backed instruments, the qualifier &quot;pass-through&quot; is used, in the same way that &quot;vanilla&quot; designates an option with no special features.

Subtypes of mortgage-backed security include:

&quot;Pass-through securities&quot; are issued by a trust and allocate the cash flows from the underlying pool to the securities holders on a pro rata basis. A trust that issues pass-through certificates is taxed under the grantor trust rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these rules, the holder of a pass-through certificate is taxed as a direct owner of the portion of the trust allocatable to the certificate. In order for the issuer to be recognized as a trust for tax purposes, there can be no significant power under the trust agreement to change the composition of the asset pool or otherwise to reinvest payments received, and the trust must have, with limited exceptions, only a single class of ownership interests.
** A &quot;residential mortgage-backed security&quot; (RMBS) is a pass-through MBS backed by mortgages on residential property.
** A &quot;commercial mortgage-backed security&quot; (CMBS) is a pass-through MBS backed by mortgages on commercial property. In addition to single-family residential mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also issue multi-family securities, expanding the diversity and reach of their securitization activities.
A &quot;collateralized mortgage obligation&quot;, or &quot;pay-through bond&quot;, is a debt obligation of a legal entity that is collateralized by the assets it owns. Pay-through bonds are typically divided into classes that have different maturities and different priorities for the receipt of principal and in some cases of interest. They often contain a sequential pay security structure, with at least two classes of mortgage-backed securities issued, with one class receiving scheduled principal payments and prepayments before any other class. Pay-through securities are classified as debt for income tax purposes.
A &quot;stripped mortgage-backed security&quot; (SMBS) where each mortgage payment is partly used to pay down the loan&#x27;s principal and partly used to pay the interest on it. These two components can be separated to create SMBS&#x27;s, of which there are two subtypes:
** An &quot;interest-only stripped mortgage-backed security&quot; (IO) is a bond with cash flows backed by the interest component of property owner&#x27;s mortgage payments.
*** A &quot;net interest margin security&quot; (NIMS) is re-securitized residual interest of a mortgage-backed security
** A &quot;principal-only stripped mortgage-backed security&quot; (PO) is a bond with cash flows backed by the principal repayment component of property owner&#x27;s mortgage payments.
There are a variety of underlying mortgage classifications in the pool:

&quot;Prime&quot; mortgages are conforming mortgages with prime borrowers, full documentation (such as verification of income and assets), strong credit scores, etc.
&quot;Alt-A&quot; mortgages are an ill-defined category, generally prime borrowers but non-conforming in some way, often lower documentation (or in some other way: vacation home, etc.) Alt-A mortgages tend to be larger in

==Uses==

There are many reasons for mortgage originators to finance their activities by issuing mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities:
# transform relatively illiquid, individual financial assets into liquid and tradable capital market instruments
# allow mortgage originators to replenish their funds, which can then be used for additional origination activities
# can be used by Wall Street banks to monetize the credit spread between the origination of an underlying mortgage (private market transaction) and the yield demanded by bond investors through bond issuance (typically a public market transaction)
# are often a more efficient and lower-cost source of financing in comparison with other bank and capital markets financing alternatives.
# allow issuers to diversify their financing sources by offering alternatives to more traditional forms of debt and equity financing
# allow issuers to remove assets from their balance sheet, which can help to improve various financial ratios, utilize capital more efficiently, and achieve compliance with risk-based capital standards

The high liquidity of most mortgage-backed securities means that an investor wishing to take a position need not deal with the difficulties of theoretical pricing described below; the price of any bond is essentially quoted at fair value, with a very narrow bid/offer spread.

Reasons (other than investment or speculation) for entering the market include the desire to hedge against a drop in prepayment rates (a critical business risk for any company specializing in refinancing).

==Market size and liquidity==
As of the second quarter of 2011, there was about $13.7 trillion in total outstanding US mortgage debt. There were about $8.5 trillion in total US mortgage-related securities, with about $7 trillion of that securitized or guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises or government agencies, and the remaining $1.5 trillion being pooled by private mortgage conduits.

As of 2021, the volume of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) outstanding in the United States has surpassed 12 trillion U.S. dollars, marking a significant growth in the market size. This expansion reflects the increasing role of MBS in the financing of residential real estate, demonstrating the importance of these securities in the overall financial system and housing market.

According to the Bond Market Association, gross US issuance of agency MBS was:

2005: USD 0.967 trillion
2004: USD 1.019 trillion
2003: USD 2.131 trillion
2002: USD 1.444 trillion
2001: USD 1.093 trillion
This data underscores the fluctuating nature of the MBS market over time, influenced by varying economic conditions, interest rates, and housing market dynamics.

==Pricing==
===Valuation===
The weighted-average maturity (WAM) and weighted average coupon (WAC) are used for valuation of a pass-through MBS, and they form the basis for computing cash flows from that mortgage pass-through. Just as this article describes a bond as a 30-year bond with 6% coupon rate, this article describes a pass-through MBS as a $3 billion pass-through with 6% pass-through rate, a 6.5% WAC, and 340-month WAM. The pass-through rate is different from the WAC; it is the rate that the investor would receive if he/she held this pass-through MBS, and the pass-through rate is almost always less than the WAC. The difference goes to servicing costs (i.e., costs incurred in collecting the loan payments and transferring the payments to the investors).

To illustrate these concepts, consider a mortgage pool with just three mortgage loans that have the following outstanding mortgage balances, mortgage rates, and months remaining to maturity:

====Weighted-average maturity====
The &quot;weighted-average maturity&quot; (WAM) of a pass-through MBS is the average of the maturities of the mortgages in the pool, weighted by their balances at the issue of the MBS. Note that this is an average across mortgages, as distinct from concepts such as weighted-average life and duration, which are averages across payments of a single loan.

The weightings are computed by dividing each outstanding loan amount by total amount outstanding in the mortgage pool (i.e., $900,000). These amounts are the outstanding amounts at the issuance or initiation of the MBS. The WAM for the above example is computed as follows:

Another measure often used is the Weighted-average loan age.

====Weighted-average coupon====
The &quot;weighted-average coupon&quot; (WAC) of a pass-through MBS is the average of the coupons of the mortgages in the pool, weighted by their original balances at the issuance of the MBS. For the above example this is:

===Theoretical pricing===
Pricing a &quot;vanilla&quot; corporate bond is based on two sources of uncertainty: default risk (credit risk) and interest rate (IR) exposure. The MBS adds a third risk: early redemption (prepayment). The number of homeowners in residential MBS securitizations who prepay increases when interest rates decrease. One reason for this phenomenon is that homeowners can refinance at a lower fixed interest rate. Commercial MBS often mitigate this risk using call protection.

Since these two sources of risk (IR and prepayment) are linked, solving mathematical models of MBS value is a difficult problem in finance. The level of difficulty rises with the complexity of the IR model and the sophistication of the prepayment IR dependence, to the point that no closed-form solution (i.e., one that could be written down) is widely known. In models of this type, numerical methods provide approximate theoretical prices. These are also required in most models that specify the credit risk as a stochastic function with an IR correlation. Practitioners typically use specialised Monte Carlo methods or modified Binomial Tree numerical solutions.

====Interest rate risk and prepayment risk====
Theoretical pricing models must take into account the link between interest rates and loan prepayment speed. Mortgage prepayments are usually made because a home is sold or because the homeowner is refinancing to a new mortgage, presumably with a lower rate or shorter term. Prepayment is classified as a &quot;risk&quot; for the MBS investor despite the fact that they receive the money, because it tends to occur when floating rates drop and the fixed income of the bond would be more valuable (negative convexity). In other words, the proceeds received would need to be reinvested at a lower interest rate. Hence the term &quot;prepayment risk&quot;.

Professional investors generally use arbitrage-pricing models to value MBS. These models deploy interest rate scenarios consistent with the current yield curve as drivers of the econometric prepayment models that models homeowner behavior as a function of projected mortgage rates. Given the market price, the model produces an option-adjusted spread, a valuation metric that takes into account the risks inherent in these complex securities. 

There are other drivers of the prepayment function (or prepayment risk), independent of the interest rate, such as:
* economic growth, which is correlated with increased turnover in the housing market
* home prices inflation
* unemployment
* regulatory risk (if borrowing requirements or tax laws in a country change this can change the market profoundly)
* demographic trends, and a shifting risk aversion profile, which can make fixed rate mortgages relatively more or less attractive

====Credit risk====
The credit risk of mortgage-backed securities depends on the likelihood of the borrower paying the promised cash flows (principal and interest) on time. The credit rating of MBS is fairly high because:
# Most mortgage originations include research on the mortgage borrower&#x27;s ability to repay, and will try to lend only to the creditworthy. An important exception to this is &quot;no-doc&quot; or &quot;low-doc&quot; loans.
# Some MBS issuers, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, guarantee against homeowner default risk. In the case of Ginnie Mae, this guarantee is backed with the full faith and credit of the US federal government. This is not the case with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but these two entities have lines of credit with the US federal government; however, these lines of credit are extremely small compared to the average amount of money circulated through these entities in one day&#x27;s business. Additionally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac generally require private mortgage insurance on loans in which the borrower provides a down payment that is less than 20% of the property value.
# Pooling many mortgages with uncorrelated default probabilities creates a bond with a much lower probability of total default, in which no homeowners are able to make their payments (see Copula). Although the risk neutral credit spread is theoretically identical between a mortgage ensemble and the average mortgage within it, the chance of catastrophic loss is reduced.
# If the property owner should default, the property remains as collateral. Although real estate prices can move below the value of the original loan, this increases the solidity of the payment guarantees and deters borrower default.

If the MBS was not underwritten by the original real estate and the issuer&#x27;s guarantee, the rating of the bonds would be much lower. Part of the reason is the expected adverse selection against borrowers with improving credit (from MBSs pooled by initial credit quality) who would have an incentive to refinance (ultimately joining an MBS pool with a higher credit rating).

===Real-world pricing===
Because of the diversity in MBS types, there is a wide variety of pricing sources. In general, the more uniform or liquid the MBS, the greater the transparency or availability of prices. Most traders and money managers use Bloomberg and Intex to analyze MBS pools and more esoteric products such as CDOs, although tools such as Citi&#x27;s The Yield Book, Barclays POINT, and BlackRock&#x27;s AnSer are also prevalent across Wall Street, especially for multi–asset class managers. Some institutions have also developed their own proprietary software.

Complex structured products tend to trade less frequently and involve more negotiation. Prices for these more complicated MBSs, as well as for CMOs and CDOs, tend to be more subjective, often available only from dealers.

The price of an MBS pool is influenced by prepayment speed, usually measured in units of CPR or PSA. When a mortgage refinances or the borrower prepays during the month, the prepayment measurement increases.

If an investor has acquired a pool at a premium (&gt;100), as is common for higher coupons, then they &quot;are&quot; at risk for prepayment. If the purchase price was 105, the investor loses 5 cents for every dollar prepaid, which may significantly decrease the yield. This is likely to happen as holders of higher-coupon mortgages can have a larger incentive to refinance.

Conversely, it may be advantageous to the bondholder for the borrower to prepay if the low-coupon MBS pool was bought at a discount (&lt;100). This is due to the fact that when the borrower pays back the mortgage, he or she does so at &quot;par&quot;. If an investor purchases a bond at 95 cents on the dollar, as the borrower prepays the investor gets the full dollar back, increasing their yield. However, this is less likely to occur, as borrowers with low-coupon mortgages have lower, or no, incentives to refinance.

The price of an MBS pool is also influenced by the loan balance. Common specifications for MBS pools are loan amount ranges that each mortgage in the pool must pass. Typically, high-premium (high-coupon) MBSs backed by mortgages with an original loan balance no larger than $85,000 command the largest pay-ups. Even though the borrower is paying an above market yield, he or she is dissuaded from refinancing a small loan balance due to the high fixed cost involved.

Low Loan Balance: &lt; $85,000
Mid Loan Balance: $85,000–$110,000
High Loan Balance: $110,000–$150,000
Super High Loan Balance: $150,000–$175,000
New Loan Balance Buckets:

$175,000–$200,000
$200,000–$225,000
$225,000–$250,000
$250,000–$275,000
TBA: &gt; $275,000
The plurality of factors makes it difficult to calculate the value of an MBS security. Often market participants do not concur, resulting in large differences in quoted prices for the same instrument. Practitioners constantly try to improve prepayment models and hope to measure values for input variables implied by the market. Varying liquidity premiums for related instruments and changing liquidity over time make this a difficult task. One factor used to express the price of an MBS security is the pool factor.

==Recording and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems==
One critical component of the securitization system in the US market is the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS) created in the 1990s, which created a private system wherein underlying mortgages were assigned and reassigned outside of the traditional county-level recording process. The legitimacy and overall accuracy of this alternative recording system have faced serious challenges with the onset of the mortgage crisis: as the US courts flood with foreclosure cases, the inadequacies of the MERS model are being exposed, and both local and federal governments have begun to take action through suits of their own and the refusal (in some jurisdictions) of the courts to recognize the legal authority of MERS assignments. The assignment of mortgage (deed of trust) and note (obligation to pay the debt) paperwork outside of the traditional US county courts (and without recordation fee payment) is subject to legal challenge. Legal inconsistencies in MERS originally appeared trivial, but they may reflect dysfunctionality in the entire US mortgage securitization industry.

==History==

In 1994, Stagecoach purchased the East London and Selkent operations during the privatisation of London bus services. Both continued to trade under their existing names until November 2000 when Stagecoach consolidated its London operations under the Stagecoach London brand with both remaining as separate legal entities.

In August 2006, Stagecoach sold its London bus operations to Macquarie Bank. The new owner restored the East London and Selkent trading name logos.

In September 2008, Thameside was established to operate route 248.

In October 2010, Stagecoach reacquired its old London operations with all operations once again rebranded as Stagecoach London.

In May 2022, Stagecoach announced it would takeover Tower Transit&#x27;s Lea Interchange garage for £20 million. The takeover was completed on 25 June 2022, with Stagecoach operating the garage under the Lea Interchange Bus Company Limited legal entity.

Following negotiations between the two operators while its regional operations were shut down ahead of entry into administration, in August 2022, social enterprise operator HCT Group&#x27;s Transport for London operations, consisting of 17 bus routes, were purchased by Stagecoach London. The deal saw around 500 members of staff and 160 buses transfer to Stagecoach&#x27;s East London operation, along with leases on the HCT Group&#x27;s Ash Grove and Walthamstow Avenue garages.

==Operations==

Stagecoach London operates services under contract to Transport for London. These are operated by 3 legal entities which all exist but under the Stagecoach London brand:

*East London (East London Bus &amp; Coach Company Limited)
*Selkent (South East London &amp; Kent Bus Company Limited)
*Thameside (East London Bus Limited)
*Lea Interchange Bus Company (Lea Interchange Bus Company Limited)

In 2000, Stagecoach&#x27;s standard bus livery of a dark blue skirt and orange and light blue swirl at the rear with the standard white replaced by red was introduced. After the sale to Macquarie Bank, an all-red livery was introduced.

A coach operation trading under the brand East London Coaches, which ceased in February 2007, and a Travelshop, which closed in March 2009, were both based at the company&#x27;s then-Ilford head office. The head office is now at the West Ham depot.

===Lea Interchange Bus Company===
====Lea Interchange (LI)====

Lea Interchange garage operates routes 58, 86, 97, 135, 236, 276, 308, 339, 488, 678, D8, W13 and W14.

Lea Interchange was opened by First London in 2007 to replace its Waterden Road, Stratford garage that closed as part of the development of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The garage was one of three sold by First in June 2013 to Tower Transit, later being sold as Tower Transit&#x27;s last-remaining garage in May 2022 to Stagecoach London. The garage today operates as a standalone Stagecoach London subsidiary, trading under the legal name Lea Interchange Bus Company Limited.

In 2023, Waltham Forest Council proposed the construction of eight high-rise residential towers, capable of housing up to 5,000 residents, in the Leyton area. One of these towers would be situated on the site of Lea Interchange garage, which is planned to be rebuilt as an all-electric garage at the base of a tower housing 650 apartments.

==Fleet==
As of March 2023, the Stagecoach London fleet consisted of 1,488 buses.

<text>Hortense Ellis (18 April 1941 – 19 October 2000) was a Jamaican reggae musician, and the younger sister of fellow artist Alton Ellis.

==Biography==
Born in Trenchtown, her father worked on the railways while her mother ran a fruit stall. She was 18 years old when she appeared on the Vere Johns Opportunity Hour, then Jamaica&#x27;s foremost outlet for young undiscovered talent. Her version of Frankie Lymon&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not Saying No at All&quot; so impressed both audience and panel that she was invited back the following week. Ellis went on to enter many more competitions and showcases and she reached six semi-finals and four finals. In 1964 she was awarded a silver cup as Jamaica&#x27;s Best Female Vocalist and went on to repeat this feat five years later.

During the 1960s, Ellis toured Jamaica with Byron Lee and The Dragonaires and had begun recording with some of the island&#x27;s top producers such as Ken Lack (&quot;I Shall Sing&quot;, &quot;Hell And Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot;), Coxsone Dodd &quot;I&#x27;ll Come Softly&quot; in 1963 and Duke Reid &quot;Midnight Train&quot;, &quot;Now And Forever&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been A Fool&quot; and &quot;True Love&quot; with Stranger Cole all in 1962.

Alton Ellis was also recording with Dodd at this time and the family connection was exploited by Dodd who produced &quot;female&quot; adaptions of some of Alton&#x27;s hits (for Hortense to record) including &quot;Why Do Birds&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Just A Guy&quot;. Dodd also paired Alton and Hortense in a run of duets such as &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; and &quot;Easy Squeeze&quot;.

The siblings toured Canada in 1970 but the following year, Ellis was back in Jamaica where she married Mikey &quot;Junior&quot; Saunders with whom she had five children in quick succession. Although her live performances suffered as a result, she remained busy in the studio. Recording under the name Mahalia Saunders for producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, she recorded several sides including &quot;Right on the Tip of My Tongue&quot; and &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;.

Ellis&#x27; success came in the late 1970s with a song recorded for Gussie Clarke; &quot;Unexpected Places&quot; was a big hit in Jamaica and also in Britain where it appeared on the Hawkeye label.

For producer Bunny &quot;Striker&quot; Lee, Ellis became Queen Tiney for her &quot;Down Town Ting&quot; – an &quot;answer&quot; record to Althea and Donna&#x27;s big hit &quot;Uptown Top Ranking&quot;, which had itself been based on the rhythm of Alton&#x27;s big hit &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love With You&quot;.

Around this time, Ellis recut many of her Coxsone/Studio One sides with Soul Syndicate, The Aggrovators and the up-and-coming team of Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare. The rise of the Lovers Rock genre in the late seventies and early eighties led to Ellis cutting cover version of several popular soul classics including &quot;Down the Aisle&quot; (Patti LaBelle) and &quot;Young Hearts Run Free&quot; (Candi Staton). Following her divorce from Mikey Saunders, Ellis spent much of the eighties living in New York City and Miami. On returning to Jamaica in 1989, she began suffering health problems, but managed to carry on with occasional local live performances. She recovered sufficiently to make a private visit to New York in the summer of 1999, and then to Miami the following year, where ill health finally caught up with her.

Despite a worsening condition and the pleadings of her daughter, Sandra Saunders, to seek immediate treatment there in Miami, Ellis insisted on returning to her beloved Jamaica where she was hospitalised almost immediately, seriously ill and in considerable pain.

Hortense Ellis died in her sleep in a Kingston hospital on 19 October 2000 from a stomach infection.

<text>Edward Taylor Scott (15 November 1883 – 22 April 1932) was a British journalist, who was editor and briefly co-owner of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, and the younger son of its editor-owner C. P. Scott.

After a brief spell at Oxford University, Ted Scott attended the London School of Economics, and eventually took a University of London external degree, having left the LSE to work as private secretary to Sidney Olivier, the governor of Jamaica. At the LSE, he lodged with the family of the economist and &quot;Guardian&quot; contributor J. A. Hobson, and he later married Hobson&#x27;s daughter Mabel.

Scott joined the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; in 1913 and became its commercial editor and main writer of leaders on economic policy. In the spring of 1915, he joined the army to fight in World War I. In 1918, he was captured as a prisoner of war until the end of hostilities. After the war, he rejoined the paper, eventually succeeding his father as editor on 1 July 1929. Scott&#x27;s most important action as editor was to move the paper from its initial position of support for Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s National Government towards the opposition.

Scott became joint owner of the &quot;Guardian&quot; with his brother John after the death of their father on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1932. Less than four months later, he drowned while sailing on Windermere. His death put the future independence of the &quot;Guardian&quot; in doubt, as the Scott family struggled to pay the inheritance taxes. He was succeeded as editor by William Percival Crozier.
