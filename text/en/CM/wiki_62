<text>Ricki-Lee Dawn Coulter (born 10 November 1985) is an Australian singer and songwriter. She was born in Auckland, New Zealand, raised in Gold Coast, Queensland, and began performing at age 15. Coulter rose to fame in 2004 on the second season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and placed seventh in the competition. She subsequently signed with Australian independent label Shock Records, and released her self-titled debut album &quot;Ricki-Lee&quot; (2005), which produced the top-ten hits &quot;Hell No!&quot; and &quot;Sunshine&quot;. Both singles were certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The following year, Coulter became a member of the Australian pop girl group Young Divas, before leaving in early 2007 to resume her solo career.

Coulter&#x27;s second album &quot;Brand New Day&quot; (2007) was certified gold and included the top-ten singles &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Sing a Different Song&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Touch It&quot;, the latter was certified platinum. Coulter&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;The Singles&quot; was released in 2008, featuring the top-twenty single &quot;Wiggle It&quot;. In 2011, she ended her contract with Shock Records and signed with major label EMI Music Australia. Coulter&#x27;s third album &quot;Fear &amp; Freedom&quot; (2012) debuted at number seven on the ARIA Albums Chart and became her first top-ten album. It included the top-twenty hits &quot;Raining Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Do It Like That&quot;, which were both certified platinum. &quot;Do It Like That&quot; was also a top-ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Japan Hot 100 chart and earned Coulter her first ARIA Music Award nomination for Song of the Year. Her fourth album &quot;Dance in the Rain&quot; (2014) became her second top-fifteen album, and featured the top-forty single &quot;All We Need Is Love&quot;. Coulter independently released her fifth album &quot;On My Own&quot; in 2024, which would become her highest peaking album on the ARIA Albums Chart to date.

Coulter has branched out from recording music, pursuing careers in television and radio. She returned to &quot;Australian Idol&quot; for seasons six and seven, as a presenter and reporter alongside James Mathison and Andrew Günsberg. The role earned her a nomination at the 2009 Logie Awards for Most Popular New Female Talent. She was also a full-time radio presenter for Sydney&#x27;s Nova 96.9 breakfast show in 2010, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. In 2019, Coulter became the host of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. Coulter was announced in September 2022 as the co-host of the 2023 Seven Network reboot of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; alongside Scott Tweedie.

== Early life ==
Ricki-Lee Dawn Coulter was born on 10 November 1985 in Auckland, New Zealand. Her name is a nod to singer Rickie Lee Jones. Her mother Loretta Sheerin, born in Tonga, was a model. Coulter&#x27;s parents separated before she was born, and she was raised by her mother. Coulter and her mother relocated to Gold Coast, Queensland when she was three months old. Coulter&#x27;s father figure at the time was her grandfather Rocky. Coulter&#x27;s mother gave her every chance to visit her biological father in New Zealand when she was a child. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a part of my life. I&#x27;d go over there and stay with him and his family, [but] it was just weird to me. Then when I got to an age where I could speak up to Mum, about six or seven, I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to go; I don&#x27;t like it.&#x27;&quot;

She attended Southport State School and experienced the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as she wanted a life similar to her school friends. &quot;Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I never had that. I&#x27;d get home from school and there was nothing in the cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up&quot;. Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.

As a teenager, she attended Southport State High School. At the age of 15, Coulter had a serious knee injury that required reconstructive surgery. She was told she would never play netball again. Several months later, Coulter&#x27;s ability to sing was discovered by her mother, who overheard her in her bedroom, which led to her performing at gigs in the Gold Coast and Brisbane areas with live bands. Aside from singing, she also learned how to play several instruments, including the tenor saxophone, flute, and trumpet, and would often play them in school concerts and the school stage band. During high school, Coulter excelled in music and sport. After completing high school in 2002, she decided to focus on her music career, and began writing her own songs with her good friend Xy Latu.

== Music career ==
=== 2003–2004: &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and &quot;Popstars Live&quot; ===
In 2003, Coulter auditioned for the first season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; but did not make it past the audition rounds. The following year, Coulter successfully auditioned for the first season of &quot;Popstars Live&quot; and progressed to the top sixty round of the competition but was part of the first group of performers who were sent home. Later that same year, Coulter successfully auditioned for the second season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, singing En Vogue&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love)&quot;, and progressed through to the semi-finals. Following the semi-final process, she had advanced through to the top twelve. Throughout the season, Coulter was regarded as a favourite to win the competition because of her performances of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;til You Get Enough&quot;, Tina Turner&#x27;s version of &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;. In the final seven weeks, Coulter was eliminated from the competition. Following her elimination, &quot;newspapers ran the story as front-page news and Coulter herself couldn&#x27;t quite hide the anger and disappointment she plainly felt&quot;. Like contestant Daniel Belle, who was eliminated the week before her, Coulter never appeared in the bottom three until her elimination.

===2005–2007: &quot;Ricki-Lee&quot; and Young Divas===

Following her departure from &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, Coulter was offered recording contracts by record labels including the show&#x27;s sponsor Sony BMG, but she signed with Australia&#x27;s biggest independent label Shock Records. Coulter explained, &quot;I&#x27;d met with a number of labels and Shock were the only one that asked me what I wanted to do and what kind of album I wanted to make and who I wanted to work with&quot;. Her debut single &quot;Hell No!&quot; was released in June 2005, ahead of the related self-titled debut album, &quot;Ricki-Lee&quot;. The song peaked at number five on the ARIA Singles Chart – remaining in the top-ten for three consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association, for shipments of 35,000 copies. &quot;Sunshine&quot; was released as her second single in September, which peaked at number eight and was also certified gold. &quot;Ricki-Lee&quot; was released on 3 October 2005, which peaked at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Coulter collaborated with several producers and songwriters on the album, including Audius Mtawarira, Israel Cruz, Nitty, Jarrad Rogers and Kara DioGuardi, among others. &quot;Breathe&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third and final single in January 2006, and reached number 14. At the 2006 Australian and New Zealand Urban Music Awards, &quot;Ricki-Lee&quot; was nominated for &#x27;Best R&amp;B Album&#x27;.

That same year, Coulter joined forces with previous &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestants Paulini, Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo to be part of the all-girl singing project called Young Divas. The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer&#x27;s single &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; in May 2006, through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song&#x27;s release. In an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, DeAraugo stated that they are &quot;not an &quot;Idol&quot; supergroup, it&#x27;s just about finding four female voices. It just so happened the four we&#x27;ve gone with are all from &quot;Idol&quot;. The single is just to promote the tour, just to show a taste of what will be on there, but there won&#x27;t be an album&quot;. Young Divas&#x27; version of &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; peaked at number two and remained in the top-ten for fourteen consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified platinum, for shipments of 70,000 copies. Five months after the single&#x27;s release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Happenin&#x27; All Over Again&quot;. The song peaked at number nine and was certified gold.

Their commercial success prompted the release of a debut album of classic disco and pop covers titled, &quot;Young Divas&quot;, on 27 November 2006, establishing themselves as an official group. The album debuted at number four and was certified double platinum, for shipments of 140,000 copies. A cover of Hazell Dean&#x27;s &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot; was released as the group&#x27;s third single, and reached number 40. In February 2007, it was announced that Young Divas had pulled out of their scheduled national tour supporting Irish boy band Westlife, because Coulter had headed overseas to work on her second solo album. The cancellation occurred amid claims that Coulter was set to leave the group, due to personality clashes with DeAraugo. The rumours were denied by the group&#x27;s manager David Champion, who stated that she would return for the group&#x27;s next headlining tour and the recording of their second album. However, on 22 June 2007, Coulter announced her departure to resume her solo career and to plan her then-upcoming wedding to fiancé, Jamie Babbington. Jessica Mauboy, who became runner-up on the fourth season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, was Coulter&#x27;s replacement in the group.

=== 2007–2010: &quot;Brand New Day&quot; and subsequent releases ===
Coulter released &quot;Can&#x27;t Touch It&quot; as the lead single from her second album &quot;Brand New Day&quot; in August 2007. The song peaked at number two and remained in the top-ten for eight consecutive weeks. It is Coulter&#x27;s most successful single, and was certified platinum in 2008. At the 2007 Jägermeister AIR Awards, &quot;Can&#x27;t Touch It&quot; was nominated for &#x27;Best Performing Independent Single/EP&#x27;. &quot;Brand New Day&quot; was released on 11 August 2007, which peaked at number 37. Coulter worked with several producers and songwriters on the album, including KNS, David Gamson, Marc Nelkin, Vince Pizzinga, Andrew De Sylva, Mtawarira and Glenn Cunningham, among others.

At the 2007 Nickelodeon Australian Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, Coulter won the award for &#x27;Fave Female Singer&#x27;. Her version of Swedish recording artist Agnes Carlsson&#x27;s &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;Brand New Day&quot; in November 2007, and peaked at number five. On 18 November 2007, Coulter performed at the first Fluffy Festival in Brisbane alongside acts such as Mr Timothy, Slinkee Minx, Potbelleez, TV Rock, Seany B and Vandalism. A month later, it was announced that Coulter had signed two international record deals, with dance label Ministry of Sound UK and the Japanese independent label Pony Canyon. &quot;Brand New Day&quot; was released in Japan on 9 January 2008, and peaked at number 242 on the Japanese Albums Chart. That same month, Coulter was a supporting act for Hilary Duff&#x27;s Australian leg of her Dignity Tour. &quot;Can&#x27;t Sing a Different Song&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third and final single in March 2008, and peaked at number eight. During this time, Coulter embarked on her Brand New Day Tour in Australia, which served as her first solo headlining tour. At the 2008 Nickelodeon Australian Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, she received two nominations in the categories of &#x27;Fave Aussie&#x27; and &#x27;Fave Singer&#x27;, and won the latter award. In September 2008, Coulter released &quot;Wiggle It&quot;, which peaked at number 11, as the lead single from her first compilation album &quot;The Singles&quot;. The album was released on 8 November 2008, but failed to impact the charts.

In July 2009, Coulter released &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss You&quot;, which peaked at number 24, as the lead single from her proposed third studio album, &quot;Hear No, See No, Speak No&quot;. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number 46. &quot;Hear No, See No, Speak No&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album&#x27;s release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March 2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys&#x27; Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song &quot;Can&#x27;t Touch It&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film, &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney&#x27;s Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. &quot;At the start of [the] year, I couldn&#x27;t imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn&#x27;t even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It&#x27;s hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I&#x27;ve ever wanted to do. I wasn&#x27;t mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I&#x27;d been worn down. I felt defeated&quot;. She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Tour&quot; DVD, she was inspired to perform again.

=== 2011–2014: &quot;Fear &amp; Freedom&quot; and &quot;Dance in the Rain&quot;===

Coulter ended her contract with Shock Records in 2011. Following the release of her single &quot;Raining Diamonds&quot; in October 2011, it was revealed that Coulter had signed a record deal with major label EMI Music Australia. &quot;Raining Diamonds&quot;, which peaked at number 19, was the lead single from Coulter&#x27;s third album, &quot;Fear &amp; Freedom&quot;, and was certified platinum. It earned her two nominations at the 2011 IT List Awards in the categories of &#x27;Single of 2011&#x27; and &#x27;Australian Female Artist&#x27;. &quot;Do It Like That&quot;, the second single, was released in March 2012, which peaked at number 13 and was certified platinum. It also became Coulter&#x27;s first single to chart internationally, reaching number seven on the Japan Hot 100 chart. &quot;Do It Like That&quot; earned Coulter her first ARIA Music Award nomination for Song of the Year.

The third single, &quot;Crazy&quot;, was released in July 2012, and reached number 46. On 30 May 2012 Coulter first performed tracks from &quot;Fear &amp; Freedom&quot;, at the Beresford Hotel, Sydney. The album was released on 17 August 2012, which debuted at number seven and became Coulter&#x27;s first top-ten album as a solo artist. In September 2012, Coulter embarked on her Fear &amp; Freedom Tour in Australia, which served as her second headlining tour. At the 2012 Cosmopolitan Fun, Fearless, Female Women of the Year Awards, Coulter won the award for &#x27;Singer of the Year&#x27;. &quot;Burn It Down&quot;, the fourth and final single from &quot;Fear &amp; Freedom&quot;, was released in December 2012, and reached number 49.

&quot;Come &amp; Get in Trouble with Me&quot; was released as Coulter&#x27;s fourteenth overall single in August 2013, and peaked at number 28. In April–May 2014, Coulter was the supporting act for Jason Derulo&#x27;s Australian leg of his Tattoos World Tour. In May 2014, she released &quot;All We Need Is Love&quot;, which peaked at number 39, as the lead single from her fourth studio album &quot;Dance in the Rain&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Happy Ever After&quot;, was released in July 2014, and debuted at number 65. &quot;Dance in the Rain&quot; was released on 17 October 2014, which debuted at number 14 and became Coulter&#x27;s second top-fifteen album. &quot;Giddyup&quot; was released as the third singles from &quot;Dance in the Rain&quot;, but failed to chart.

===2015–2022: Single releases===
In 2015 and 2016, Coulter took a break from releasing music and spent two years living and writing songs in Los Angeles. After a three-year hiatus, she released the single &quot;Not Too Late&quot; in September 2017. The &quot;lulling, soft ballad&quot; marks a departure from Coulter&#x27;s previous dance releases, and is lyrically about &quot;redemption and it never being too late to right our wrongs and start again.&quot; &quot;Not Too Late&quot; was released through Universal Music Australia, following their purchase of Coulter&#x27;s label EMI, and debuted at number 83. In April 2018, Coulter performed at both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games, held on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Coulter released the single &quot;Unbothered&quot; in October 2018. &quot;Unbothered&quot; was described by Denise Raward of &quot;Sunshine Coast Daily&quot; as an &quot;unashamed&quot; pop track with a &quot;cruisy&quot; tone and &quot;sassy&quot; lyrics. Coulter referred to &quot;Unbothered&quot; as an &quot;anthem&quot; that talks about walking &quot;away from shitty people and shitty situations,&quot; and &quot;taking control back.&quot;

In May 2019, Coulter began to embark on her Ricki-Lee: Live in Concert Tour in Australia, which was held to celebrate her first 15 years in the music industry. The tour featured Coulter performing songs from the film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (2018) and from her time on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; (2004), as well as her greatest hits as a solo artist and with the Young Divas. Coulter&#x27;s first music release in two years, the song &quot;Last Night&quot;, was released on 12 June 2020.

=== 2023–present: &quot;On My Own&quot; ===
In March 2023, Ricki-Lee released &quot;On My Own&quot;, the first single from her fifth studio album. The second single &quot;Point of No Return&quot; was released on 21 July 2023. In November 2023, Coulter released the third single for the album titled &quot;Ghost&quot; and announced her fifth studio album would be released in March 2024, titled &quot;On My Own&quot;. The fourth and final single &quot;I Was Made for Loving You&quot; was released on 1 March 2024, and the album officially dropped on 8 March. On My Own debuted at Number 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart being the highest selling album by an Australian artist that week. 

== Musical style and influences ==
Coulter&#x27;s music has ranged from R&amp;B and pop, to electro, rock and dance. Guy Blackman of &quot;The Age&quot; noted that Coulter&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Ricki-Lee&quot; (2005), &quot;is an infectious collection of R&amp;B-tinged pop tunes that takes a step beyond the usual &quot;Idol&quot; fodder&quot;. Matthew Chisling of Allmusic also noted that the album includes elements of rock, and compared the material to artists such as S Club 7 and Nicole Scherzinger. Her second album, &quot;Brand New Day&quot; (2007), features upbeat dance songs, with elements of disco, reggae, 40s swing music, 70s jazz pop and motown. The lyrics for the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Can&#x27;t Sing a Different Song&quot; are &quot;&#x27;kind of bragging&#x27; about how happy she and her husband&quot; at the time, Babbington, are. In 2009, Coulter released the singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss You&quot; and &quot;Hear No, See No, Speak No&quot;, which showcased a new electropop and rock sound. Coulter admitted that &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss You&quot; was about ending her relationship with Babbington, saying &quot;it was my first break-up and he was my first boyfriend so I can&#x27;t lie&quot;. Aside from recording music, Coulter has co-written much of her own material. She co-wrote four songs on her debut album, ten songs on her second album, and twelve songs on her third album.
Coulter has said that she grew up listening to artists such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, citing the latter as an influence. She has also named Michael Jackson and Beyoncé as influences, she told &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, &quot;[Beyoncé is] so driven, she pushes herself to the limits and she&#x27;s achieved so much but she&#x27;s always looking for what that next thing is and how she can improve from what she&#x27;s done in the past. She&#x27;s really setting the benchmark for female artists and I think she kind of is the Michael Jackson of this generation&quot;. Critics have compared Coulter&#x27;s songs &quot;Do It Like That&quot; (2012) and its accompanying music video, as well as &quot;Giddyup&quot; (2014) to Beyoncé&#x27;s work. Coulter has expressed admiration for other female artists such as Madonna, Pink, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.

== Personal life ==
At age 15, Coulter met Jamie Babbington, a builder from the Gold Coast who was aged 23 at the time. They started &quot;dating seriously&quot; after about a year. Coulter and Babbington married at a secret location in Canungra, Queensland on 7 September 2007. Coulter took her husband&#x27;s last name and became Ricki-Lee Babbington. The couple had their honeymoon in the Maldives for five weeks. The following year, on 18 October 2008, Coulter&#x27;s publicist issued a statement that they had separated due to &quot;distance and time apart&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Herald Sun&quot;″s Jonathan Moran, three years after the marriage ended, Coulter revealed that she had experienced depression during her relationship with Babbington. &quot;I was living my dream but behind closed doors my personal life was a mess. [...] I felt alone, I bottled it all up and it made things worse. I wanted to give up everything. I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house for days at a time. I&#x27;d sit in the house all day and do nothing&quot;.

In September 2009, Coulter began dating her manager Richard Harrison, and in August 2010, the couple went public with their relationship. Before meeting Harrison, Coulter was considered a role model for curvy girls and stated that she was proud of being a size 14 woman.

<doc id="1214135" wikidata="Q208032" url="?curid=1214135" title="Arctostaphylos uva-ursi">
<text>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi is a plant species of the genus &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; widely distributed across circumboreal regions of the subarctic Northern Hemisphere. Kinnikinnick (from the Unami language for &quot;smoking mixture&quot;) is a common name in Canada and the United States. Growing up to in height, the leaves are evergreen. The flowers are white to pink and the fruit is a red berry.

One of several related species referred to as [[bearberry]], its specific epithet &quot;uva-ursi&quot; means &quot;grape of the bear&quot; in Latin, similar to the meaning of the generic epithet &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; (Greek for &quot;bear grapes&quot;).

==Description==
&quot;Arctostaphylos uva-ursi&quot; is a small procumbent woody groundcover shrub growing to high.
Wild stands of the species can be dense, with heights rarely taller than . Erect branching twigs emerge from long flexible prostrate stems, which are produced by single roots. The trailing stems will layer, sending out small roots periodically. The finely textured velvety branches are initially white to pale green, becoming smooth and red-brown with maturity. The small solitary three-scaled buds are dark brown.

The leaves are shiny, small, and feel thick and stiff, measuring about long and wide. Their tops are darker green than their undersides. They have rounded tips tapering back to the base, held vertically by a twisted leaf stalk in an alternate arrangement on the stem. The leaves remain green for 1–3 years before falling in autumn, when their colour changes to a reddish-green or purple, pale on the underside.

Terminal clusters of small urn-shaped flowers bloom from May to June. The flowers are white to pink, and bear round, fleshy or mealy, bright red to pink fruits called drupes. The smooth, glossy skinned fruits range from in diameter. The red fruits persist on the plant into early winter. The fruits are bittersweet when raw, but sweeter when boiled and dried. Each drupe contains 1 to 5 hard seeds, which need to be scarified and stratified prior to germination to reduce the seed coat and break embryo dormancy. There is an average of 40,900 cleaned seeds per pound.

===Chemistry===
The plant contains diverse phytochemicals, including ursolic acid, tannic acid, gallic acid, some essential oils and resin, hydroquinones (mainly arbutin, up to 17%), tannins (up to 15%), phenolic glycosides and flavonoids.

== Subspecies ==
As many as 14 subspecies have been accepted, however as of 2024 they are considered synonyms by major sources such as Plants of the World Online and World Flora Online.

== Etymology ==
The genus name of &quot;Arctostaphylos uva-ursi&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;arctos&quot; (meaning bear) and &quot;staphyle&quot; (meaning &quot;bunch of grapes&quot;) in reference to the fruits which form grape-like clusters. In the wild, the fruits are commonly eaten by bears. The specific epithet, &quot;uva-ursi&quot;, comes from the Latin words &quot;uva&quot; (meaning grape) and &quot;ursus&quot; (bear), reflected by the &quot;bearberry&quot; nickname.

The common name, &quot;kinnikinnick&quot;, is an Algonquin word meaning &quot;smoking mixture&quot;. Native Americans and early pioneers smoked the dried &quot;uva-ursi&quot; leaves and bark alone or mixed with other herbs, tobacco or dried dogwood bark in pipes. Numerous common names exist, depending on region, such as mealberry, sandberry, mountain-box, fox-plum, hog-crawberry, and barren myrtle.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The distribution of &quot;Arctostaphylos uva-ursi&quot; is circumpolar, and it is widespread in northern latitudes, but confined to high altitudes further south: 
* in Europe, from Iceland and North Cape, Norway south to southern Spain (Sierra Nevada); central Italy (Apennines) and northern Greece (Pindus mountains);
* in Asia from arctic Siberia south to Turkey, the Caucasus, the Levant and the Himalaya;
* in North America from arctic Alaska, Canada and Greenland, south to California, north coast, central High Sierra Nevada (above Convict Lake, Mono County, California), Central Coast, California, San Francisco Bay Area, to New Mexico in the Rocky Mountains; and the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast United States. It is prevalent across all regions of British Columbia and Alberta.

== Ecology ==
It is a fire-tolerant species and may be a seedbanking species.

&quot;Arctostaphylos uva-ursi&quot; is an alternate host for spruce broom rust.

Bears and other animals eat the berries.

==Conservation==
The plant is rare or endangered in several states of the Midwestern United States.

==Toxicity==
One review indicated that ingestion of large doses can cause allergic reactions, with nausea and seizures, as a potential emergency condition. Preliminary studies indicate that arbutin may be toxic when ingested in high doses. Uva ursi may cause adverse effects in people with liver or kidney disease, or pregnant and breastfeeding women.

The leaves contain arbutin, which metabolizes to form hydroquinone, a potential liver toxin.

==Uses==
Bearberry fruits and leaves are used by members of the Blackfeet Nation as food. While edible raw, the fruits are fairly bland that way, but can be used to make jelly. The berries were used as seasoning and cooked with meat. The young leaves can be made into tea.
Teas and extracts of the leaves have been used in traditional medicine of First Nations people over centuries as urinary tract antiseptics, diuretics, and laxatives. In herbalism, leaf tea is used to treat urinary tract inflammation. Though thought to be an astringent or cure for sexually transmitted diseases, as of 2017, there was no high-quality evidence from clinical research that such treatments are effective or safe.

Dried bearberry leaves are the main component in many traditional North American Native smoking mixes, known collectively as &quot;kinnikinnick&quot; (Algonquin for &quot;smoking mixture&quot;) used especially among western First Nations, often including other herbs and sometimes tobacco.

Indigenous peoples also used the plant to make yellow dye.

There are several cultivars that are propagated for use as ornamental plants. It is an attractive year-round evergreen groundcover for gardens, and is useful for controlling erosion on hillsides and slopes due to its deep roots. It is tolerant of sun and dry soils, and is thus common groundcover in urban areas, in naturalized areas, and in native plant or rock gardens. As the seeds are difficult to germinate they are most often propagated using rooted stems.

<text>The New York Mets Hall of Fame was created in order to recognize the careers of former New York Mets players, managers, broadcasters and executives. There are presently 30 members. Originally located in the Diamond Club at Shea Stadium, the inductees were honored with plaques in the Mets Hall of Fame and Museum at Citi Field, which opened in April 2010. In Citi Field&#x27;s first season, 2009, the space was part of the Mets Team Store. Following the 2023 season, the Hall of Fame was moved to the Field Level of the Jackie Robinson Rotunda while the museum was closed to expand the Team Store.

<doc id="1214165" wikidata="Q441904" url="?curid=1214165" title="Gary Lucas">
<text>Gary Lucas (born June 20, 1952) is an American guitarist, songwriter, and composer who was a member of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s band. He formed the band Gods and Monsters in 1989.

Lucas has released more than 50 albums to date as a solo artist or band leader in a variety of genres, touring internationally.

Lucas has collaborated with Leonard Bernstein, Jeff Buckley, John Cale, Nick Cave, David Johansen, and Lou Reed. He has also worked with Chris Cornell, Najma Akhtar, DJ Spooky, Dr. John, Amanda Palmer, Bryan Ferry, The Future Sound of London, Allen Ginsberg, Peter Hammill, Warren Haynes, Dave Liebman, Joe Lovano, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, Geoff Muldaur, Bob Neuwirth, Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, Graham Parker, Van Dyke Parks, Iggy Pop, Roswell Rudd, Fred Schneider, Richard Barone, John Sebastian, Adrian Sherwood, Patti Smith, Peter Stampfel, Damo Suzuki, Steve Swallow, Bob Weir, John Zorn, Nona Hendryx, Emir Kusturica and the No Smoking Orchestra, Hal Willner, Kip Hanrahan, Elli Medeiros, Haydee Milanes, Suylen Milanes, Los Van Van, and Alabama Three.

In 2020, instead of doing live performances, which was not possible due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Lucas started a Pandemic Live Streaming every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 3pm EST on his Facebook page, which has gathered fans from all over the world.

==Early life==
Lucas was born in Syracuse, New York. He obtained a degree in English from Yale University (1974), before establishing his career in music first as a college DJ and then as music director at the college radio station, WYBC FM.

According to his website, Lucas was encouraged by his father to try the guitar at the age of nine, while simultaneously studying the French horn, and played in jazz and rock groups during his teens in the 1960s.

== Career ==
His next album, &quot;The Essential Gary Lucas&quot; (Knitting Factory Records), a 36-track, two-CD anthology was released in January, 2021, spanned 40 years of Lucas&#x27;s music. &quot;Broadway World&quot; wrote that the album, &quot;offers ample evidence of this maverick artist&#x27;s trailblazing and unique career... a truly epic body of work that spans psychedelic rock, film music, classical, electronica, jazz, blues, avant-garde, and world music excursions through 1930s Chinese pop, Hungarian folk, raga, and more, all unified by Lucas&#x27;s virtuosic guitar and ceaselessly questing spirit.&quot;

In late October 2020, Lucas was invited with the authorization of the Dutch government to play the So What&#x27;s Next? Festival in Eindhoven in the Netherlands with his live solo score accompanying the Spanish &quot;Dracula&quot; on Halloween, and a new duo project with Dutch acoustic bassist and singer Peter Willems. Lucas successfully overrode the travel ban on Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic to journey to the Netherlands, the first country in Europe to get behind his music in a big way, and his shows were live-streamed on social media from the Eindhoven Muziekgebouw. While there, he recorded a new album with Willems, scheduled for 2021 release.

=== Le Beast Concrète ===
On July 1, 2021, Lucas released a new electronica collaboration, Le Beast Concrète, with producer/DJ David Sisko.&quot;&quot; First was the digital single &quot;Realize It&quot;, with accompanying psychedelic animated clip by 3XA. About their new single, &quot;La Ruta&quot; (Spain) wrote: &quot;Always surprising and unfathomable, Gary Lucas presents a new single with producer and engineer David Sisko combining Gary&#x27;s signature guitar riffs and lines with Sisko&#x27;s deep 808 trap and relentless dancefloor beats with a result that reflects the guitar player&#x27;s complexity mixing genres such as blues, rock, dance, trap and avant-garde&quot;. More positive reviews followed in &quot;UnCut&quot; magazine and elsewhere.

Lucas also published several articles at Please Kill Me.com during the pandemic, including an extensive piece about his relationship with Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa, a memoir of working on a rap record with Vin Diesel and Arthur Russell, and an appreciation of the Bonzo Dog Band&#x27;s Vivian Stanshall, the original Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s leader Peter Green, and the Rolling Stones&#x27; Brian Jones.

On September 11, 2021, Lucas celebrated his 40th anniversary in music at Le Poisson Rouge in NYC with a 2 hour show featuring Ernie Brooks, Jerry Harrison, Thurston Moore and other special guests. On September 15, 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine published their revised list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time which included Lucas and Jeff Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Grace&quot;, as featured on Buckley&#x27;s two million selling 1994 album &quot;Grace&quot;.

Some of these collaborations appear on his retrospective 2000 album &quot;Improve the Shining Hour&quot;, which also features his film and TV music for &quot;ABC News&quot;, &quot;20/20,&quot; and &quot;Turning Point&quot;. He has produced albums for composer/saxophonists Tim Berne and Peter Gordon, and for the French avant-rock band Tanger. He co-wrote Joan Osborne&#x27;s Grammy-nominated song &quot;Spider Web&quot; from her triple platinum album &quot;Relish&quot; and co-wrote Jeff Buckley&#x27;s anthems &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; from the &quot;Grace&quot; album, often cited as one of the Top 50 Albums of All Time.

=== Captain Beefheart ===
During his last year in high school, Lucas played for the documentary film unit of the Upstate Medical Center and wrote the musical score on his first film assignment. In 1971, he traveled from New Haven to New York City to see his childhood hero Captain Beefheart (Don Van Vliet) make his New York concert debut, and later became close friends. From being a Beefheart fan, he eventually became his co-manager in 1980 with his then wife Ling Lucas, and occasionally performed on stage all over Europe and the U.S. during the 1980–81 tours with Beefheart&#x27;s band, performing the difficult and complex solo guitar piece &quot;Flavor Bud Living&quot;.

After gaining his degree, Lucas played for a few years with the O-Bay-Gone Band in Taipei, Taiwan while working for his father after college. He played with them for a few years before gaining a significant step in his career during 1980–82, when he was engaged to record on two Beefheart albums released by Virgin Records, on one of which he was full-time lead alongside Moris Tepper. Lucas performed over a period of five years with the last incarnation of Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band. He performed as a special guest—his first appearance on an album—on Beefheart&#x27;s 1980  &quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot;, which had put him on the musical map with critics and fans. He also read one of Van Vliet&#x27;s poems (“One Man Sentence” or “Untitled”), and joined the Magic band on guitar (“Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles”) and bass (“Making Love to a Vampire with a Monkey on My Knee”). On 1982&#x27;s &quot;Ice Cream for Crow&quot;, he was a full Magic Band member playing twin lead guitar alongside Tepper. In 1982 he became Van Vliet&#x27;s sole manager as well as a full member of Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band.

After Captain Beefheart retired in the 1980s, Lucas continued to be associated with the Magic Band&#x27;s former members. Several of Beefheart&#x27;s former band members reformed the group, touring as the Magic Band from 2003 to 2006. Their 2007 double album and DVD, &quot;21st Century Mirror Men&quot;, followed up their debut album &quot;Back to the Front&quot;, which was chosen as one of the best albums of 2004 by &quot;The Wire&quot;. In 1988, Lucas performed at New York&#x27;s Knitting Factory. Shortly after, he was invited to appear at the 1988 JazzFest Berlin.

In 2006 Lucas co-led with saxophonist Philip Johnston an all-instrumental Beefheart tribute band, Fast &#x27;n&#x27; Bulbous: the Captain Beefheart Project etc. Their debut album &quot;Pork Chop Blue Around the Rind&quot; was profiled on NPR and charted on college radio in the United States. In Fall 2006, they toured Europe extensively, selling out shows at the London Jazz Festival, in Amsterdam&#x27;s Bimhuis, as well as playing in Bern, Switzerland; Vienna and Schwaz, Austria; and Ljubljana, Slovenia. The group released its second album, &quot;Waxed Oop&quot;, on Cuneiform Records in 2008, and performed at the Zappanale in Bad Doberan Germany in 2012.

2017 marked the 50th anniversary of the release of Beefheart&#x27;s album &quot;Safe as Milk,&quot; and saw Lucas engaged in numerous projects to mark the occasion. This included feature coverage in &quot;MOJO&quot; magazine that coincided with the Captain Beefheart Weekend in Liverpool, England, where Lucas served on a panel at the participating Bluecoat Gallery. In collaboration with Dutch DJ/producer Co de Cloet, the final interview given by Don Van Vliet was set to music composed by Lucas. Titled &quot;I Have a Cat,&quot; it was commissioned by Dutch national radio NPS where it was first broadcast in 1993. Later the project was released digitally by OkayMusic, and the pair performed the work live at the Zappanale in Germany as well as at the BimHuis in Amsterdam.

On February 17, 2013, Lucas led the 65-piece Metropole Orchestra in a symphonic tribute to Captain Beefheart at the Paradiso Amsterdam, produced by Co De Kloet. Titled &quot;The World of Captain Beefheart&quot;, the concert featured Nona Hendryx (Labelle) as well as Jolene Grunberg, Tom Trapp and other Dutch singers.

In September 2017, the scaled-down five-piece Captain Beefheart tribute ensemble, The World of Captain Beefheart, led by Lucas and Nona Hendryx, performed an album teaser performance at the Public Theater. The self-titled album was released in November 2017 on Knitting Factory Records. January 22, 2018 saw a special multimedia performance of The World of Captain Beefheart at City Winery, New York.

=== Jeff Buckley/Gods and Monsters ===
In 1989, Lucas formed his band Gods and Monsters. He took the name from a line from the film &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;: &quot;To a new world of gods and monsters!&quot; Originally an instrumental ensemble featuring two bass players, Lucas began writing songs and inviting singers to perform at an ad hoc basis in 1990. Lucas first met Jeff Buckley in New York at the 1991 Tim Buckley tribute concert, mounted by producer Hal Willner at St. Anne&#x27;s Church in Brooklyn. Buckley stayed in New York and joined Gods and Monsters. Lucas composed solo guitar instrumentals for &quot;Rise Up to Be&quot; and &quot;And You Will&quot;, which later became the musical templates for &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Mojo Pin&quot;, which Lucas co-wrote with Buckley for his album, &quot;Grace&quot;. Early collaborations can also be heard on the Jeff Buckley and Gary Lucas album &quot;Songs to No One&quot;, which charted internationally with worldwide sales approaching 100,000. In the film &quot;Greetings from Tim Buckley&quot; (2013), Penn Badgely plays Buckley, and Tony Award winner Frank Wood plays Gary Lucas.

In May 2011, Lucas released a new studio album with Gods and Monsters, titled &quot;The Ordeal of Civility&quot;. Gods and Monsters celebrated their 25th anniversary in June 2014 with a special performance at (Le) Poisson Rouge.

Early in 2018, Lucas performed a special concert of the dozen songs he co-wrote with Jeff Buckley. He performed with Jolene Grunberg and other singers, was accompanied by the 65-piece Metropole Orchestra at the Paradiso Amsterdam, and the show was produced by Co de Kloet.

In the fall of 2019, Lucas released &quot;The Complete Jeff Buckley and Gary Lucas Songbook&quot; (Esordisco) with Italian singer The Niro (Davide Combusti). The album was recorded in Rome at the end of 2018 and featured new studio versions of all 12 songs co-written by Jeff Buckley and Gary Lucas including five never before officially released. By Christmas that year, the album was voted Best Album of 2019 by Classic Rock Magazine Italia.

Lucas has continued to operate Gods and Monsters on and off since 1989. Their last studio album was 2012&#x27;s &quot;The Ordeal of Civility&quot;, which was produced by Jerry Harrison, who was also a group member for several years. The lineup also features Ernie Brooks (The Modern Lovers) on bass, Billy Ficca (Television) on drums, and Jason Candler (Hungry March Band) on saxophone. The full lineup has performed in St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Austin Texas.

=== The Edge of Heaven ===
Gary has a long history working with Chinese music, stemming back to two years working for the family business in Taipei Taiwan from 1975 to 1977.

==Reception==
Lucas draws from the blues tradition and includes styles such as psychedelic rock, world music, and jazz, as well as classical works. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described his guitar playing: &quot;Gary Lucas plays guitar the way Salvador Dalí painted, with dazzling displays of technique, wicked humor, and a thirst to completely refashion his art from its basic elements&quot;.

Lucas has been described as a &quot;guitarist with a global guitar&quot; (Larry Rohter, 9 May 2011, &quot;New York Times&quot;) &quot;one of the best and most original guitarists in America&quot; (David Fricke, 16 November 2006, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;); a &quot;legendary leftfield guitarist&quot; (&quot;The Guardian&quot;, 24 December 2005); &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s guitar hero&quot; (&quot;The New Yorker&quot;, 8 January 2007), &quot;perhaps the greatest living electric guitar player&quot; (Daniel Levitin) and one of &quot;the most innovative and challenging guitarists playing today&quot; (&quot;fRoots&quot;, March 2002). Lucas&#x27; style melds easily into rock and blues, has &quot;avant-garde affinities&quot;, but is &quot;not easily typecast&quot; according to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

February 2014 saw the release of &quot;Otherworld&quot;, an experimental collaboration between Lucas and Peter Hammill. The album was well received by critics, with &quot;MAX Magazine Italy&quot; writing, &quot;Guitars, abstract landscapes, breathtaking texts (as always when a true poet as Hammill gathers in the field), spectral songs, layers, all conspire to create something unexpectedly powerful and disarming&quot;. Lucas and Hammill were featured on the covers of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine and &quot;Rock Society&quot; magazine for the project, in addition to featured coverage in &quot;Prog&quot; magazine. &quot;Record Collector&quot; gave the album four stars (out of four), and &quot;Uncut&quot; marked it seven out of ten.

It was #1 on the World Music Charts in Canada and garnered international attention, England&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; magazine awarding it 4 stars, and &quot;Mojo&quot; writing: &quot;It is simply gorgeous&quot;. The album was chosen as one of the best discs of the year in France&#x27;s &quot;Libération&quot; newspaper. There was a lengthy profile for the album in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, as well as an NPR interview. Lucas released an expanded concert version of &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot; with his band, Gods and Monsters, and vocalists Sally Kwok and Mo Hai Jin, both from Shanghai. The group received standing ovations at the Holland Festival in Amsterdam in June 2011.

2016 saw three new releases have a positive critical response. &quot;Fleischerei: Music from Max Fleischer Cartoons&quot;, featuring Joe Fiedler, Jeff Lederer, Michael Bates, Rob Garcia, and Sarah Stiles, was named &quot;One of the Best Albums of 2016&quot; by Down Beat and &quot;One of the Best Indie Albums of 2016&quot; by Goldmine (magazine). &quot;Pearly Clouds&quot;, an exploration of traditional Hungarian folk music, featuring saxophonist Toni Dezso and vocalist Eniko Szabo, was called &quot;a record of spiritual longing and timeless musical transcendence&quot; by FRoots and described as &quot;unusual and compelling listening&quot; by BBC Three. The acoustic folk pop collaboration with Jann Klose, &quot;Stereopticon&quot; was given four stars by Mojo (magazine). No Depression (magazine) wrote of the record, saying &quot;the harmonies, vocal interactions, and clear precise acoustic guitar provide the listener with enchanting listening.”

2021 finally saw the release of Gary&#x27;s 40-year retrospective double album THE ESSENTIAL GARY LUCAS on Knitting Factory Records, after many delays in the previous year due to the pandemic. The critical response to date to the compilation has been tremendous, with 3 high-profile reviews in the UK. MOJO gave the album four stars, calling it an &quot;extraordinary 2-CD retrospective.&quot; The Wire said, “There isn&#x27;t a single item here that doesn&#x27;t have Lucas&#x27;s musical personality running through it like quartz. Essential? It&#x27;s all essential.&quot; UnCut called it &quot;A testament to the man&#x27;s restless energy and imagination.&quot;

The media coverage continued with an hour-plus appearance on music critic David Fricke&#x27;s show, &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Block&quot;, on the SIRIUS XM radio February 10, and an interview in Aquarium Drunkard. Lucas was Artist of the Week in the second week of February on WPKN in Bridgeport Conn where his track &quot;King Strong&quot; rose to #3 Favorite Track of the Week.

<text>Barry Unsworth FRSL (10 August 19304 June 2012) was an English writer known for his historical fiction. He published 17 novels, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times, winning once for the 1992 novel &quot;Sacred Hunger&quot;.

==Biography==
Unsworth was born on 10 August 1930 in Wingate, a mining village in County Durham, England, to a family of miners. His father first entered the mines at age 12 and ordinarily Unsworth would have followed him as a miner. However, when his father was 19, he travelled to the United States for a few years and on returning to Britain entered the insurance business and thus began moving his family up the economic ladder and out of the mines. &quot;He rescued my brother and me from that long chain of continuity that happens in mining villages,&quot; Unsworth said.

He graduated from the University of Manchester in 1951, and lived in France for a year teaching English. He also travelled extensively in Greece and Turkey during the 1960s, lecturing at the University of Athens and the University of Istanbul. His novels about fin-de-siecle Ottoman Empire, &quot;The Rage of the Vulture&quot; and &quot;Pascali&#x27;s Island&quot;, were inspired by these experiences. He published his first novel in 1966, his second novel, &quot;The Greeks Have a Word For It&quot;, was an outgrowth of his teaching experience in Athens.

In 1999 he was a visiting professor at the University of Iowa&#x27;s Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. In 2004 he taught literature and creative writing classes at Kenyon College in Ohio.

In the last years of his life, he lived in Perugia, a city in the Umbria region of Italy, with his second wife, a Finnish national. His novel &quot;After Hannibal&quot; is a fictionalised description of his efforts at settlement in the Italian countryside.

Unsworth died in Perugia, Italy in 2012, of lung cancer. He was 81. Unsworth died the same day as Ray Bradbury; as Cynthia Crossen said in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bradbury invented the future; Mr. Unsworth invented the past.&quot;

==Work==
Unsworth&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Partnership&quot;, was published in 1966 when he was 36. &quot;...in my earlier novels, especially the two written in the early &#x27;70s, &quot;The Hide&quot; and &quot;Mooncranker&#x27;s Gift&quot;, there was a baroque quality in the style, a density. The mood was grim, but the language was more figurative and more high-spirited. There was more delight in it, more self-indulgence, too. Among my earliest influences as a writer were the American novelists of the deep south, especially Eudora Welty, and some of that elated, grotesque comedy stayed with me.&quot; &quot;Mooncranker&#x27;s Gift&quot; (1973) won the Heinemann Award. Other novels included &quot;Stone Virgin&quot; (1985) and &quot;Losing Nelson&quot; (1999). In addition to Eudora Welty, he counted William Faulkner and Carson McCullers as his major influences.

Unsworth did not start to write historical fiction until his sixth novel, &quot;Pascali&#x27;s Island&quot; (1980), the first of his novels to be shortlisted for the Booker Prize. &quot;Pascali&#x27;s Island&quot; is set on an unnamed Aegean island during the last years of the Ottoman Empire. Reflecting on this shift, Unsworth explained: &quot;Nowadays I go to Britain relatively rarely and for short periods; in effect, I have become an expatriate. The result has been a certain loss of interest in British life and society and a very definite loss of confidence in my ability to register the contemporary scene there – the kind of things people say, the styles of dress, the politics etc.– with sufficient subtlety and accuracy. So I have turned to the past. The great advantage of this, for a writer of my temperament at least, is that one is freed from a great deal of surface clutter. One is enabled to take a remote period and use it as a distant mirror (to borrow Barbara Tuchman’s phrase), and so try to say things about our human condition – then and now – which transcend the particular period and become timeless.&quot; A film version directed by James Dearden, starring Charles Dance, Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley, as the title character, was released in 1988.

&quot;Morality Play&quot;, shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1995, is a murder mystery set in 14th century England about a travelling troupe of players that put on Bible plays. It was adapted as a film, &quot;The Reckoning&quot; (2004), starring Paul Bettany and Willem Dafoe.

&quot;Sacred Hunger&quot; (1992) centres on the Atlantic slave trade that moves from Liverpool to West Africa, Florida and the West Indies. It was joint winner of the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1992, along with Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s &quot;The English Patient&quot;. It is generally considered his masterpiece. The story is set in the mid-18th century and centres around the &quot;Liverpool Merchant&quot;, a slave ship employed in the triangular trade, a central trade route in the Atlantic slave trade. The two main characters are cousins Erasmus Kemp, son of a wealthy merchant from Lancashire, and Matthew Paris, a physician and scientist who goes on the voyage. The novel&#x27;s central theme is greed, with the subject of slavery being a primary medium for exploring how selfish desire for profit can result in evil and barbarism. The &quot;sacred hunger&quot; of the title refers to the profit motive. The story line has a very extensive cast of characters, some featuring in only one scene, others continually developed throughout the story, but most described in intricate detail. The narrative interweaves elements of appalling cruelty and horror with extended comedic interludes, and employs frequent period expressions. A sequel, &quot;The Quality of Mercy&quot;, was published in 2011, it was his last book.

&quot;Sugar and Rum&quot; (1988) was a novel set in contemporary Liverpool about a writer who is trying to write a novel about the Liverpool slave trade, and who is suffering from writer&#x27;s block; Unsworth wrote this novel to try to get over his own block during the writing of &quot;Sacred Hunger&quot;.

==Style==
Unsworth&#x27;s style is not heaped in historical minutiae, &quot;I don&#x27;t really care how many buttons someone had on his waistcoat. It would be good to get it right, but what really matters is trying to get hold of the spirit of the age, what it was like to be alive in that age, what it felt like to be…an ordinary person in the margins of history.&quot;

On writing and growing old, Unsworth said, &quot;With time I have grown more sparing with the words. I think less of fire-works and flourishes. I try to get warmth and colour through precision of language. This is more difficult, I think, which may be why I find writing novels so challenging and exacting.&quot;

Some critics have attacked historical fiction as being un-literary, for example James Wood writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it a &quot;somewhat gimcrack genre not exactly jammed with greatness.&quot; However Unsworth defended the form, saying &quot;The term historical fiction is a blunt instrument in literary criticism. When people ask, &#x27;Is it a good historical novel?&#x27; they may as well ask, &#x27;Is it a good Protestant novel?&#x27; or &#x27;Is it a good transvestite novel?&#x27; I write stories that are set in the past. Fiction set in the past should be judged by the same criteria as any other fiction. Does the novel convey a sense of life, touch the reader&#x27;s mind and heart? Does it belong to what D.H. Lawrence called the one bright book of life?&quot;

<doc id="1214168" wikidata="Q796306" url="?curid=1214168" title="BMC ADO16">
<text>The BMC ADO16 is a range of small family cars built by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and, later, British Leyland. Launched in 1962, it was Britain&#x27;s best-selling car from 1963 to 1966 and from 1968 to 1971. The ADO16 was marketed globally under various make and model names; the most prolific variant was the Austin 1100 and Morris 1100. A the height of its popularity, it was widely known as the 1100 (eleven-hundred) in its home market, or as the 1300 when equipped with the 1275cc engine.

In production for 12 years, production of the ADO16 reached 2.1 million between 1962 and 1974, more than half of those sold in the UK home market. British Leyland phased out the 1100/1300 between 1971 and 1974 in favour of the Morris Marina and the Austin Allegro.

==Naming==
The ADO16 was marketed under numerous make and models, including:

* Austin: 1100, 1300 and 1300GT
* Austin: 11/55, America, Apache, De Luxe, Glider and Victoria
* Innocenti: Austin I4 and Austin I4S 
* Innocenti: Morris IM3 and Morris IM3S 
* Innocenti I5
* MG: 1100, 1275 and 1300
* MG: Princess, Sports Sedan, 1100S and MG-S 1300
* Morris: 1100, 1300 and 1300GT
* Morris: 11/55, 1100S, Marina and Marina GT
* Riley: Kestrel, Kestrel 1275, Kestrel 1300 and 1300 
* Vanden Plas: Princess 1100, Princess 1275 and Princess 1300
* Wolseley: 1100, 1275 and 1300
* Wolseley: 11/55 &lt;ref name=&quot;aronline_1100/1300&quot;&gt;&quot;Also known as : BMC 1100/1300&quot;, www.aronline.co.uk Retrieved on 3 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; Wesp 

In line with BMC&#x27;s policy at the time, Austin badged versions of the ADO16 were built at Longbridge, whilst Morris and MG versions were assembled at Cowley. However, some were also built in Spain by Authi, in Italy by Innocenti, in Yugoslavia (Slovenia) by IMV, and at the company&#x27;s own plant in Belgium. It was the basis for locally adapted similar cars manufactured in Australia and South Africa. Various versions including Austin, Morris, MG, Wolseley and Riley were assembled in New Zealand and Malta from CKD kits from 1963 until the final Austin/Morris versions were discontinued in 1974, a year after the launch of its replacement, the Austin Allegro.

The vehicle was launched as the Morris 1100 on 15 August 1962. The range was expanded to include several rebadged versions, including the twin-carburettor MG 1100 (introduced at the end of September 1962), the Austin 1100 (August 1963), the Vanden Plas Princess 1100 (October 1963) and finally the Wolseley 1100 (1965) and Riley Kestrel (1965). The Morris badged 1100/1300 models were discontinued on the launch of the Morris Marina in 1971, but the Austin and Vanden Plas versions remained in production in the UK until June 1974.

The three-door estate version followed in 1966, called &quot;Countryman&quot; in the Austin version and &quot;Traveller&quot; in the Morris one, continuing the established naming scheme. The Austin 1100 Countryman appeared in the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;Gourmet Night&quot;, in which the short-tempered owner of Fawlty Towers Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) gave it a &quot;damn good thrashing&quot;. This episode was first shown in October 1975, by that time it was already out of production. 

In 1964, the 1100 was &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year.

For most of its production life, the ADO16 was Britain&#x27;s best selling car, holding around 15% of the new car market at its peak, before finally being outsold by the Ford Cortina in 1972.

==Design and development==
The ADO16 (Amalgamated Drawing Office project number 16) was designed by Sir Alec Issigonis. Following his success with the Mini, Issigonis set out to design a larger and more sophisticated car which incorporated more advanced features and innovations. Pininfarina, the Italian styling studio that had worked with BMC before on the Austin A40 Farina, was commissioned to style the car. ADO16 had comparable interior space to the larger Ford Cortina.

In common with the Mini, the ADO16 was designed around the BMC A-Series engine, mounted transversely and driving the front wheels. As well as single piston swinging caliper disc brakes at the front, which were not common on mass-produced cars in the early 1960s, the ADO16 featured a Hydrolastic interconnected fluid suspension system designed by Alex Moulton. The mechanically interconnected Citroen 2CV suspension was assessed in the mid-1950s by Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton (according to an interview by Moulton with &quot;Car&quot; magazine in the late 1990s), and was an inspiration in the design of the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked.

BMC engineer Charles Griffin took over development work from Issigonis at the end of the 1950s while Issigonis completed work on the Mini. Griffin ensured the 1100 had high levels of refinement, comfort and presentation. Griffin would later have overall responsibility for the Princess, Metro, Maestro and Montego ranges.

&quot;Autocar&quot; reports in October 1973, while the car was still in production, that approximately 2,365,420 ADO16s had been produced.

==Mark I (1962–1967)==

The original Mark I models were distinctive for their use of a Hydrolastic suspension. Marketing material highlighted the spacious cabin when compared to competitor models which in the UK by 1964 included the more conservatively configured Ford Anglia, Vauxhall Viva and BMC&#x27;s own still popular Morris Minor. Unlike almost all of its competitors, the AD016 featured front-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive.

The Mark I Austin / Morris 1100 was available, initially, only as a four-door saloon. In March 1966 a three-door estate became available, badged as the Morris 1100 Traveller or the Austin 1100 Countryman. Domestic market customers looking for a two-door saloon would have to await the arrival in 1967 of the Mark II version, although the two-door 1100 saloon had by now been introduced to certain overseas markets, including the United States where a two-door MG 1100 was offered.

An Automotive Products (AP) four-speed automatic transmission was added as an option in November 1965. In order to avoid the serious levels of power loss then typical in small-engined cars with automatic transmission the manufacturers incorporated a new carburettor and a higher compression ratio in the new 1965 automatic transmission cars: indeed a press report of the time found very little power loss in the automatic 1100, though the same report expressed the suspicion that this might in part reflect the unusually high level of power loss resulting from the way in which the installation of the transversely-mounted &quot;normal&quot; manual gearbox had been engineered.

===Engine===
* 1962–1974: 1098 cc &quot;A-Series&quot; I4

==Mark II (1967–1971)==
At the end of May 1967, BMC announced the fitting of a larger 1275 cc engine to the MG, Riley Kestrel, Vanden Plas and Wolseley variants. The new car combined the 1275 cc engine block already familiar to drivers of newer Mini Cooper S and Austin-Healey Sprite models with the 1100 transmission, its gear ratios remaining unchanged for the larger engine, but the final-drive being significantly more highly geared.

The Mark II versions of the Austin and Morris models were announced, with the larger engine making it into these two makes&#x27; UK market ranges in October 1967 (as the Austin 1300 and Morris 1300). An 1100 version of the Mark II continued alongside the larger-engined models.

Unusually for cars at this end of the market, domestic market waiting lists of several months accumulated for the 1300-engined cars during the closing months of 1967 and well into 1968. The manufacturers explained that following the devaluation of the British Pound in the Fall / Autumn of 1967 they were working flat out to satisfy export market demand, but impatient British would-be customers could be reassured that export sales of the 1300s were &quot;going very well&quot;. MG, Wolseley, Riley and Vanden Plas variants with the 1300 engines were already available on the home market in very limited quantities, and Austin and Morris versions would begin to be &quot;available here in small quantities in March 1968&quot;.

The addition of a larger engined model to the ADO16 range came at a time when most cars of this size were now available with larger engines than the 1100 cc unit which until then had been the only engine available in the whole range. Its key rivals in the 1960s were the Vauxhall Viva (in HA form from 1963 and HB form from 1966) and the Ford Anglia (and from the end of 1967, the Anglia&#x27;s successor, the Escort). From 1970, it had gained another fresh rival in the form of the HC Viva, and also from a new Rootes Group model, the Hillman Avenger.

On the outside, a slightly wider front grille, extending a little beneath the headlights, and with revised detailing, differentiated Austin / Morris Mark IIs from their Mark I predecessors, along with a slightly smoother tail light fitting which also found its way onto the FX4 London taxi of the time. Austin and Morris grilles were again differentiated, the Austin having wavy bars and the Morris straight ones. The 1100 had been introduced with synchromesh on the top three ratios: all synchromesh manual gearboxes were introduced with the 1275 cc models at the end of 1967 and found their way into 1098 cc cars a few months later.

Mark II versions of the MG, Riley, Vanden Plas and Wolseley were introduced in October 1968, at which time Riley abandoned the Kestrel name. The Riley 1300 Mark II was discontinued in July 1969, and signalled the demise of the Riley marque, proving to be a shade of things to come as the 1970s would see British Leyland discontinue the Wolseley marque and sell most of its model ranges under a solitary brand.

At the London Motor Show in October 1969 the manufacturers introduced the Austin / Morris 1300 GT, featuring the same 1275 cc twin carburetter engine as that installed in the MG 1300, but with a black full width grille, a black vinyl roof and a thick black metal strip along the side. This was BMC&#x27;s answer to the Ford Escort GT and its Vauxhall counterpart. Ride height on the Austin / Morris 1300 GT was fractionally lowered through the reduction of the Hydrolastic fluid pressure from 225 to 205 psi.

During 1970, despite being fundamentally little changed since the introduction of the Morris 1100 in 1962, the Austin/Morris 1100/1300 retained its position as Britain&#x27;s top-selling car, with 132,965 vehicles registered as against 123,025 for the Ford Cortina, in that year entering its third incarnation. By the time the two millionth ADO16 was produced, at the end of June 1971, the Morris-badged version of the car had been withdrawn in order to create space in the range and in the showrooms for the Morris Marina. 1971 turned out to be the 1100/1300&#x27;s last year at the top of the UK charts.

==Mark III (1971–1974)==
The Mark III models were introduced in September 1971. At the launch of the Morris 1100 in 1962 the manufacturer stated that they intended for the ADO16 models to remain in production for at least ten years, which despite BMC&#x27;s vicissitudes through the 1960s turned out to be reasonably prescient. The range was gradually reduced, with the MG 1300 dropped in 1971 and the Wolseley 1300 in 1973. The final British ADO16, a Vanden Plas Princess 1300, left the factory on 19 June 1974. When British Leyland replaced the ADO16, it was replaced variously by the Austin Maxi (1969), the Morris Marina (1971), and the Austin Allegro (1973). The luxury Vanden Plas 1500 version of the Allegro debuted in 1975.

By this time, its original rival, the Ford Cortina, had long since grown larger, putting ADO16 into the small, rather than medium-sized class, which British Leyland was now competing in with the Austin Maxi, Morris Marina as well as the long-running Austin 1800 saloons. The ADO16&#x27;s final key rivals were the Ford Escort, Vauxhall Viva and Hillman Avenger. Foreign cars were also becoming increasingly popular on the UK market during the early 1970s, with perhaps the biggest imported rival to the ADO16 being the Datsun Sunny from Japan.

==Legacy==
As of February 2016 according to DVLA data there were 640 examples that were taxed and on UK roads.

During the Worboys Committee in the 1960s when the British road signage system was being redesigned, the silhouette of the ADO16 (since it was the UK&#x27;s best selling car of the time) was used in many of the new road sign designs which are all still in use.

==ADO16 overseas==

The car was sold with various names in different markets.

In Spain it was sold as Morris, Austin and MG, starting production in the Pamplona &quot;Authi&quot; (&quot;Automóviles de Turismo Hispano Ingleses&quot;) factory in 1966, and evolving by 1972 into the Austin Victoria.

In Denmark the ADO16 bore the Morris Marina name from 1962 to 1972 - the same name as the British-built and better-known range of saloons produced in the British Leyland range from 1971 to 1980. The MG models were sold as the MG Sports Sedan there, as it was in North America from 1962, and was available with a two-door bodyshell that was unavailable in the UK until 1968. The Vanden Plas Princess was briefly the MG Princess 1100 in North America, while that market also saw an unusual two-door Austin 1100 (with a hybrid of Mark I and Mark II components). The ADO16 was not a strong seller in the Northern American markets - particularly in the USA where it was by far one of the smallest cars on sale. In the Netherlands the Austin version was sold as the Austin Glider.

The Austin America was sold in the US, Canada and Switzerland between 1968 and 1972. This two-door version of the car featured a 1275 cc engine. Various modifications were made to suit the US market including an &quot;anti-pollution air injection system&quot;, a split circuit braking system, rocker switches in place of some of the dashboard mounted knobs, a &quot;hazard warning system&quot; and flush door locks.

The ADO16 also formed the basis of the Australian Morris 1500 sedan (coded YDO15 ), Morris 1300 sedan (YDO15 ) and Morris Nomad five-door (YDO9 ), the Italian Innocenti Morris IM3 and Austin I4 and I5, the more powerful South African Austin, Morris and Wolseley 11/55 and Austin Apache and the Spanish Austin Victoria and the Austin de Luxe of 1974 to 1977, which had a 998 cc engine.

The Austin Apache was produced until 1977, the last of the ADO16 line, ending a production run of 15 years.
==BMC 1100 Aerodinamica==
In 1967 Pininfarina unveiled at the Turin Motor Show a concept car based on the BMC ADO17 (BMC 1800 aka the Landcrab) called the BMC 1800 Aerodinamica. The sleek design predated the Citroen CX by some seven years. The car was evaluated by BMC, and Pininfarina developed a further smaller model based on the BMC ADO16 model, but the design was not taken up by the then merged British Leyland. This was after BMC had investigated a Mini shaped version. The 1800 version was however used by chief engineer Harry Webster and was known within the Austin Morris division as the Yellow Peril.

<text>The Buckner Building is an abandoned former U.S. military building in Whittier, Alaska, on the Western edge of the Prince William Sound.

== History ==
During the early stages of World War II, General Simon Buckner commanded the defense of Alaska and was concerned they would be attacked by air. To protect the troops, General Buckner recommended a facility that was independent from local power plants, bomb-proof, and that had sufficient storage spaces. Whittier, Alaska was the perfect place to have this military base.

First, the bay area around Whittier, Alaska has deep-water ports that stay ice-free year round. With Whittier being one of two all-weather railroad ports that supplied Anchorage with military necessities, it was important that it would stay functioning and safeguarded. Second, the almost constant cloud coverage would protect the facility from air strikes.

=== Annex ===
The Cold War triggered the United States Army Corps of Engineers to quickly build housing and recreational spaces for 1,000 soldiers moving to Whittier. The Composite Bachelor Housing Service and Recreation Center, also known as the Buckner Building, was completed in 1953. This combined building had a mess hall, sleeping quarters, movie theatre, bowling alley, small jail, and tunnels connecting the town of Whittier, Alaska.

The building used to be one of the largest in Alaska, often being referred to as &quot;the city under one roof&quot;. The building is six stories tall, about 500 feet long by 50–150 feet wide and is approximately 275,000 square feet. The building was cast in place by reinforced concrete on slate/greywacke bedrock, 8,1.

=== Earthquake ===
In 1964, Whittier was hit by an earthquake that lasted about four and a half minutes. A total of 13 people died in Whittier and damages to federal and privately owned land was estimated to cost over $5 million. The Buckner Building was slightly damaged, though it was minimized due to the foundation being on bedrock, as opposed to the majority of the town which rests on unconsolidated sediment and therefore received more damage. The Buckner Building also runs northeast–southwest, oblique to the seismic motion, decreasing the effect of the earthquake on the building. There was no structural damage to the building, and subsequent inspections found the building to be in good condition.

=== Decline ===

The building continued to operate until 1966, at which point the military pulled out and the Port of Whittier was transferred to the General Services Administration. After the military left, the ownership of the Buckner Building went through a handful of private citizens, starting in 1972. At one point, it was owned by one Pete Zamarello who wanted to turn it into the state prison. With the windows and doors missing, the elements began to take it over in the 1980s. Water infiltrated, leaving the building in a constant state of freezing and thawing.

The building went into foreclosure in 2016. The city assumed ownership and a fence was built to keep trespassers out. A structural assessment of the building in 2016 concluded that it was unlikely that any significant portion of the building could be rehabilitated for occupancy.

<text>Abd al-Mu&#x27;min (c. 1094–1163) (; full name: ʿAbd al-Muʾmin ibn ʿAlī ibn ʿAlwī ibn Yaʿlā al-Kūmī Abū Muḥammad) was a prominent member of the Almohad movement. Although the Almohad movement itself was founded by Ibn Tumart, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min was the founder of the ruling dynasty and creator of the Almohad empire. As a leader of the Almohad movement he became the first Caliph of the Almohad Empire in 1133, after the death in 1130 of the movement&#x27;s founder, Ibn Tumart, and ruled until his death in 1163. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min put his predecessor&#x27;s doctrine of Almohadism into practice, defeated the Almoravids, and extended his rule across Al-Andalus (on the Iberian Peninsula) and as far as Tunis in Ifriqiya (present-day Tunisia), thus bringing the Maghreb in North Africa and Al-Andalus in Europe under one creed and one government.

== Early life ==
Abd al-Mu&#x27;min was born in the village of Tagra, near Tlemcen, in the Kingdom of the Hammadids, present-day Algeria, into the Kumiya tribe, an Arabized section of the Berber Zenata tribal confederation. This tribe settled in the north of what is now the province of Oran, not far from Nedroma. His father was a potter from Nedroma.

While young, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min went to Tlemcen to learn the Fiqh. His tutor died before he could complete his study. He then was made aware of a learned and pious Faqih called &quot;Feqih Soussi&quot; (later known as Ibn Tumart) who was travelling from the east on his way to his native land in Tinmel, present-day Morocco. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min and his peers wanted to convince Ibn Tumart to settle in Tlemcen, so he was sent to Ibn Tumart with a letter from the students inviting him to come to their land. The two met at Mellala near Bejaïa. Ibn Tumart turned down the invitation, but Abd al-Mu&#x27;min stayed with him and they continued the journey together to Morocco.

== Political life ==

Some time around 1117, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min became a follower of Ibn Tumart, leader of the Masmudas (a Berber tribe of present-day western Morocco), a religious and military leader of renowned piety who had founded the Almohads as a religious order with the goal of restoring purity in Islam. His group had long been at odds with the Almoravids and had been forced into exile in the mountains. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min stayed with Ibn Tumart as he journeyed slowly towards Marrakesh. It was there that his mentor declared himself the &quot;Mahdi&quot; (divinely guided one) and that he was opposed to the Almoravid dynasty. After this pronouncement, the group moved to the Atlas Mountains and gathered followers there. In time they created a small Almohad state. During an attack on Marrakesh, al-Bashir the second in command, was killed and Abd al-Mu&#x27;min was named to take his place.

When Ibn Tumart died in 1130 at his ribat in Tinmel, after suffering a severe defeat at the hands of the Almoravids, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min and the council of ten kept the death of Ibn Tumart secret for 3 years, since the Almohads were going through a difficult time in their fight against the Almoravids. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min also feared that the Masmuda (the Berber tribe of Ibn Tumart) would not accept him as their leader since he was an outsider. He did eventually lead the Almohads when a family relationship was arranged between him and Cheikh Abu Hafs, the leader of the Masmuda. He then came forward as the lieutenant of Ibn Tumart, became the leader of the movement, and forged it into a powerful military force. He proclaimed himself Caliph, with the titles of (&#x27;Representative of the Mahdi&#x27;) and later – probably after the conquest of Marrakesh – of &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot; (&#x27;Prince/Commander of the Believers&#x27;). He eventually adopted an Arab Qaysi genealogy that included the prophet Muhammad. Under him, the Almohads swept down from the mountains, eventually destroying the power of the faltering Almoravid dynasty by 1147.

Abd al-Mu&#x27;min created his empire by first winning control of the high Atlas Mountains, then the Middle Atlas, into the Rif region, eventually moving into his homeland north of Tlemcen. In 1145, after the Almoravids lost the leader of their Catalan mercenaries, Reveter, the Almohads defeated them in open battle. From this point the Almohads moved west onto the Atlantic coastal plain. After laying siege to Marrakesh, they finally captured it in 1147. Traditional accounts state that after establishing his capital at Marrakesh, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min created a dilemma in that the Almohads considered it a city of heretics. He contented himself with the destruction of their palace and mosques, although it is not clear whether these were actually demolished or merely abandoned.

The Almohads&#x27; involvement in Al-Andalus began as early as 1145, when Ali ibn Isa ibn Maymun, the Almoravid naval commander of Cadiz, defected to &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min. In the same year, Ibn Qasi, the ruler of Silves, was one of the first Andalusian leaders to appeal for Almohad intervention in Al-Andalus in order to stop the advance of the Christian kingdoms, whom the faltering Almoravids were unable to contain. In 1147 Abd al-Mu&#x27;min sent a military force led by another Almoravid defector, Abu Ishaq Barraz, who captured Algeciras and Tarifa before moving west to Niebla, Badajoz, and the Algarve. The Almoravids in Seville were besieged in 1147 until the city was captured in 1148 with local support.

Around this time a major rebellion centred in the Sous valley, led by Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd Allah al-Massi, shook the Almohad Empire and took on religious dimensions, rallying various tribes to counter the Almohads. Some important cities such as Ceuta, Salé, and Sijilmassa overthrew their Almohad governors. An Almoravid, Yahya ibn al-Sahrawiyya, was declared ruler of Ceuta. After initial Almohad setbacks, the rebellion was eventually suppressed thanks to Abd al-Mu&#x27;min&#x27;s lieutenant, Umar al-Hintati, who led a force that killed al-Massi. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min is said to have resorted to more draconian measures afterwards and initiated a purge of people he thought might be disloyal among the subject Berber tribes, allegedly resulting in around 30,000 executions.

The rebellion had taxed Almohad resources and resulted in temporary reversals in Al-Andalus too, but the Almohads soon went on the offensive again. Responding to local appeals from Muslim officials, they took control of Cordoba in 1149, saving the city from the forces of Alfonso VII. The remaining Almoravids in Al-Andalus, led by Yahya ibn Ghaniya, were by then confined to Granada. In 1150 or 1151 Abd al-Mu&#x27;min summoned the leaders and notables of Al-Andalus under his control to Ribat al-Fath (Rabat), where he made them pledge loyalty to him, apparently as a political demonstration of his power. The Almoravids in Granada were defeated in 1155 and retreated to the Balearic Islands, where they held out for several decades.

For much of the 1150s, however, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min concentrated his efforts on expanding eastwards across North Africa to Ifriqiya. By 1151, he had reached Constantine where he confronted a coalition of Arab tribes that had been marching through Berber lands. Rather than destroying these tribes, he utilised them for his campaigns in al-Andalus and they also helped to quell any internal opposition from the family of Ibn Tumart. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min led his forces to conquer Tunis in 1159, going on to progressively establish control over Ifriqiya by conquering the cities of Mahdia (then held by Roger II of Sicily), Kairouan, and other coastal cities as far as Tripoli (in modern-day Libya). He then returned to Marrakesh and left for an expedition to Al-Andalus in 1161. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min had ordered the construction of a new citadel at Gibraltar, where he based himself during his stay in Al-Andalus.

== Final years ==

The Almohad empire was built by Abd al-Mu&#x27;min and effectively ruled by his family (known as the Mu&#x27;minids). This plus his ongoing military activity angered those who considered themselves the founders of the Almohad movement. These founders made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Abd al-Mu&#x27;min in 1160.

Abd al-Mu&#x27;min returned from Al-Andalus to the Maghreb in 1162. Over the next year he stayed in Ribat al-Fath and began to gather troops within its walls with the intention of launching another expedition to Al-Andalus. However, he fell ill and, after long period of sickness, died there in May 1163 (Jumada II 558 AH). His body was transported to Tinmel, where he was buried, following a ceremony, next to Ibn Tumart in the religious complex (which was centred around the Great Mosque of Tinmel) he had built there years earlier. His son Abu Ya&#x27;qub Yusuf succeeded him.

== Legacy ==
Abd al-Mu&#x27;min established a central government that would control North Africa for more than a half century after he died. He founded a dynasty which his family, the Mu&#x27;minids, controlled. He added to the traditional clan organisations of the Berbers the concept of &quot;Makhzan&quot;, a central administration staffed by Spanish Muslims. To keep the Empire&#x27;s revenue flowing, he created a land registry. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min also supported the arts, but in keeping with the founders&#x27; wishes, when mosques were built he kept them simple and plain compared to other structures of that time. He is considered as a national hero in Algeria.

He was also a prodigious builder of monuments and palaces. He notably founded the Kutubiyya Mosque in Marrakesh and the Mosque of Tinmel. In 1150 he built the Kasbah of the Udayas, across the river from Salé, and founded an adjacent settlement. Naming the new fortress &quot;al-Mahdiyya&quot; or &quot;Ribat al-Fath&quot;, he intended to use it as a staging point for future campaigns on the Iberian Peninsula. The settlement was further embellished and fortified by Yaq&#x27;ub al-Mansur at the end of the 12th century, and eventually became modern-day Rabat.

<text>Notre musique (English: &quot;Our Music&quot;) is a 2004 film directed by Jean-Luc Godard. The film reflects on violence, morality, and the representation of violence in film, and touches especially on past colonialism and the current Israeli–Palestinian conflict. It was screened out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;Notre musique&quot; received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
The film is divided into three parts inspired by the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante. &quot;Realm 1: Hell&quot; is a relatively brief, non-narrative montage composed of appropriated documentary and narrative fictional footage depicting war, carnage, and violence.

The second segment, &quot;Realm 2: Purgatory&quot;, makes up the bulk of the film. Godard, playing himself, is waiting at the airport to depart to a European arts conference in Sarajevo. There he meets Ramos Garcia, a nationalized French Israeli, who is going to the conference as an interpreter. Ramos is looking forward to seeing his niece at the conference, Olga Brodsky, a French-speaking Jew of Russian descent. Another young woman at the conference, Judith Lerner, a journalist from Tel Aviv, visits the French ambassador and entreats him to have an on-the-record conversation about Jewish-Palestinian relations (&quot;not a just conversation; just a conversation&quot;). Later she interviews the poet Mahmoud Darwish, who says that Israel defines the Palestinian struggle. In between these encounters, Judith surveys the city, and visits the Mostar bridge, where she reads Emmanuel Levinas (&quot;Entre Nous&quot;).

Meanwhile, Olga attends Godard&#x27;s lecture, ostensibly about the relationship between image and text. In addition to touching on a variety of other topics, Godard explains his opposition to the common cinematic trope of &quot;shot/reverse shot,&quot; the cutting back and forth between two characters in a conversation or an exchange. Godard explains that presenting two characters in such a way, framed identically, regressively effaces their differences, and can be used as a tool of propaganda. Later Olga meets with her uncle Ramos, and discusses with him the philosophical problem of suicide.

After the conference, Godard is back home, watering his garden. He gets a call from Ramos Garcia, who tells Godard about a young woman who ran into a theater and declared she had a bomb in her bag. She asked for one person to die with her for Israeli-Palestinian peace; everyone left the theater. The police came and shot her. When they opened her bag, all they found were books. Garcia tells Godard that he is sure it was Olga.

In &quot;Realm 3: Heaven,&quot; a brief postlude, Olga wanders contemplatively through an idyllic lakeside setting that appears to be guarded by American marines.

A part on the soundtrack of the movie is made by Meredith Monk, an American composer.

==Critical reception==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 65% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 52 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 77 out of 100, based on 19 reviews.

==Awards and nominations==
* European Film Awards
** Nominated: Best Actress (Sarah Adler)
** Nominated: Best Screenwriter (Jean-Luc Godard)

<text>Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML, APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer of the white blood cells. In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes. The disease is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (&quot;RARA&quot;) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-&quot;trans&quot; retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness, with a median survival time of less than a week. Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms tend to be similar to AML in general with the following being possible symptoms:

* Anemia
* Fatigue
* Weakness
* Chills
* Depression
* Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
* Low platelets (thrombocytopenia) leading to easy bleeding
* Fever
* Infection as a result of low neutrophils (neutropenia)
* Elevated white blood cells (leukocytosis)
* Coagulopathy (including disseminated intravascular coagulation)
* Bicytopenia

Easy bleeding from low platelets may include:
* Bruising (ecchymosis)
* Gingival bleeding
* Nose bleeds (epistaxis)
* Bleeding from the gums
* Increased menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)
* Brain bleed (intracerebral hemorrhage)

==Pathogenesis==
Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (&quot;RARA&quot;) gene on chromosome 17. In 95% of cases of APL, the &quot;RARA&quot; gene on chromosome 17 is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the promyelocytic leukemia gene (&quot;PML&quot;) on chromosome 15, a translocation denoted as t(15;17)(q22;q21). The RAR receptor is dependent on retinoic acid for regulation of transcription.

Eight other rare gene rearrangements have been described in APL fusing &quot;RARA&quot; to promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (&quot;PLZF&quot;), nucleophosmin, nuclear matrix associated, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (&quot;STAT5B&quot;), protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1α (&quot;PRKAR1A&quot;), factor interacting with PAPOLA and CPSF1 (&quot;FIP1L1&quot;), BCL-6 corepressor or oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold containing 2A (&quot;NABP1&quot;) genes. Some of these rearrangements are ATRA-sensitive or have unknown sensitivity to ATRA because they are so rare; STAT5B/RARA and PLZF/RARA are known to be resistant to ATRA.

The fusion of &quot;PML&quot; and &quot;RARA&quot; results in expression of a hybrid protein with altered functions. This fusion protein binds with enhanced affinity to sites on the cell&#x27;s DNA, blocking transcription and differentiation of granulocytes. It does so by enhancing interaction of nuclear co-repressor (NCOR) molecule and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Although the chromosomal translocation involving &quot;RARA&quot; is believed to be the initiating event, additional mutations are required for the development of leukemia.

RARA/PLZF gene fusion produces a subtype of APL that is unresponsive to tretinoin therapy and less responsive to standard anthracycline chemotherapy hence leading to poorer long-term outcomes in this subset of patients.

==Diagnosis==

Acute promyelocytic leukemia can be distinguished from other types of AML based on microscopic examination of the blood film or a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy as well as finding the characteristic rearrangement. The presence of promyelocytes containing multiple Auer rods (termed faggot cells) on the peripheral blood smear is highly suggestive of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Definitive diagnosis requires testing for the PML/RARA fusion gene. This may be done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization, or conventional cytogenetics of peripheral blood or bone marrow. This mutation involves a translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17. On rare occasions, a cryptic translocation may occur which cannot be detected by cytogenetic testing; on these occasions PCR testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis.
==Treatment==

===Initial treatment===



APL is unique among leukemias due to its sensitivity to all-&quot;trans&quot; retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin), the acid form of vitamin A. Treatment with ATRA dissociates the NCOR-HDAC complex from RAR and allows DNA transcription and differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes by targeting the oncogenic transcription factor and its aberrant action. Unlike other chemotherapies, ATRA does not directly kill the malignant cells. ATRA induces the terminal differentiation of the leukemic promyelocytes, after which these differentiated malignant cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis on their own. ATRA alone is capable of inducing remission but it is short-lived in the absence of concurrent &quot;traditional&quot; chemotherapy. As of 2013 the standard of treatment for concurrent chemotherapy has become arsenic trioxide, which combined with ATRA is referred to ATRA-ATO; before 2013 the standard of treatment was anthracycline (e.g. daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin or mitoxantrone)-based chemotherapy. Both chemotherapies result in a clinical remission in approximately 90% of patients with arsenic trioxide having a more favorable side effect profile.

ATRA therapy is associated with the unique side effect of differentiation syndrome. This is associated with the development of dyspnea, fever, weight gain, peripheral edema and is treated with dexamethasone. The etiology of retinoic acid syndrome has been attributed to capillary leak syndrome from cytokine release from the differentiating promyelocytes.

The monoclonal antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been used successfully as a treatment for APL, although it has been withdrawn from the US market due to concerns regarding potential toxicity of the drug and it is not currently marketed in Australia, Canada or the UK. Given in conjunction with ATRA, it produces a response in around 84% of patients with APL, which is comparable to the rate seen in patients treated with ATRA and anthracycline-based therapy. It produces less cardiotoxicity than anthracycline-based treatments and hence may be preferable in these patients.

According to recent updates, the combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO) is now preferred for induction therapy in many cases, offering at least as effective results with fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. In cases of relapse, options include re-treatment with ATO or the targeted drug gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg). 

===Maintenance therapy===

After stable remission was induced, the standard of care previously was to undergo 2 years of maintenance chemotherapy with methotrexate, mercaptopurine and ATRA. A significant portion of patients relapsed without consolidation therapy. In the 2000, European APL study, the 2-year relapse rate for those that did not receive consolidation chemotherapy (ATRA not included) therapy was 27% compared to 11% in those that did receive consolidation therapy (p&lt;0.01). Likewise, in the 2000 US APL study, the survival rates in those receiving ATRA maintenance was 61% compared to just 36% without ATRA maintenance.

However, recent research on consolidation therapy following ATRA-ATO, which became the standard treatment in 2013, has found that maintenance therapy in low-risk patients following this therapy may be unnecessary, although this is controversial.

===Relapsed or refractory disease===
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is currently being evaluated for treatment of relapsed/refractory disease. Remission with arsenic trioxide has been reported.
Studies have shown arsenic reorganizes nuclear bodies and degrades the mutant PML-RAR fusion protein. Arsenic also increases caspase activity which then induces apoptosis. It does reduce the relapse rate for high risk patients. In Japan a synthetic retinoid, tamibarotene, is licensed for use as a treatment for ATRA-resistant APL.

===Investigational agents===
Some evidence supports the potential therapeutic utility of histone deacetylase inhibitors such as valproic acid or vorinostat in treating APL. According to one study, a cinnamon extract has effect on the apoptotic process in acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells.

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis is generally good relative to other leukemias. Because of the acuteness of onset compared to other leukemias, early death is comparatively more common. If untreated, it has median survival of less than a month. It has been transformed from a highly fatal disease to a highly curable one. The cause of early death is most commonly severe bleeding, often intracranial hemorrhage. Early death from hemorrhage occurs in 5–10% of patients in countries with adequate access to healthcare and 20–30% of patients in less developed countries. Risk factors for early death due to hemorrhage include delayed diagnosis, late treatment initiation, and high white blood cell count on admission. Despite advances in treatment, early death rates have remained relatively constant, as described by several groups including Scott McClellan, Bruno Medeiros, and Ash Alizadeh at Stanford University.

Relapse rates are extremely low. Most deaths following remission are from other causes, such as second malignancies, which in one study occurred in 8% of patients. In this study, second malignancies accounted for 41% of deaths, and heart disease, 29%. Survival rates were 88% at 6.3 years and 82% at 7.9 years.

In another study, 10-year survival rate was estimated to be approximately 77%.

==Epidemiology==
Acute promyelocytic leukemia represents 10–12% of AML cases. The median age is approximately 30–40 years, which is considerably younger than the other subtypes of AML (70 years), however in elderly population APL has peculiar characteristics. Incidence is higher among individuals of Latin American or South European origin. It can also occur as a secondary malignancy in those that receive treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors (such as the anthracyclines and etoposide) due to the carcinogenic effects of these agents, with patients with breast cancer representing the majority of such patients. Around 40% of patients with APL also have a chromosomal abnormality such as trisomy 8 or isochromosome 17 which do not appear to impact on long-term outcomes.

<text>Clearly Canadian is a brand of premium sparkling waters produced by The Clearly Food &amp; Beverage Company Ltd., in Canada. The brand was founded in 1987 in British Columbia, Canada and is widely recognized in United States, parts of Europe and Japan.

==History==
Clearly Canadian was founded in 1987 by Gordon Sim, Doug Mason and others in British Columbia. It is often considered as one of the first premium &quot;new age beverage&quot; products, helping to pave way for the multibillion-dollar market in this category. The brand has produced its products every year since 1987, except for a brief haitus in 2010 and 2011.

Clearly Canadian experienced rapid market-dominating growth throughout the 1990s alongside Snapple and Red Bull, but fell into broad corporate mismanagement beginning in 2000 and up to 2012, when it was acquired by serial entrepreneur, Robert R. Khan, under his 4NCapital Partners investment firm. Large-scale commercial production resumed shortly thereafter in Canada and was precipitated by an online crowd-sourcing campaign that pre-sold in excess of 40,000 cases. Rhett and Link, celebrity hosts of internet comedy show &quot;Good Mythical Morning&quot;, played a major role in promoting the campaign to save the beverage of their childhood.

==Volcano==
To the west of the suburb is Mount Wellington, a 137-metre volcanic peak which is part of the Auckland volcanic field, and which was formed by an eruption around 9,000 years ago.

==Related names==
By a quirk of geographical naming, the suburb of East Tāmaki is located several kilometres to the south of Tāmaki because it takes its name from the fact that it is on the eastern side of the Tamaki River, rather than from its relationship to Tāmaki.

The name &quot;Tāmaki&quot; was the Māori name for the Auckland isthmus, and was later applied to the eastern part of early Auckland (towards the Tamaki River), as in the name of the Tamaki Road Board.

The name &quot;Tāmaki&quot; is of contested origin. It is an ancient Polynesian word for &quot;battle&quot;; it can also mean &quot;full of people&quot;, i.e., heavily populated – an ironic possibility given that the Māori name of the heavily populated Auckland isthmus in Māori is &quot;Tāmaki-makau-rau&quot;. A third possible origin of the names is &quot;Tā-Maki&quot;, meaning &quot;successful attack by Maki&quot;, which was the name of a local tribal chief.

<text>The New River Tunnel, officially known as the Henry E. Kinney Tunnel, is a highway tunnel that carries U.S. Route 1 underneath the New River and Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The tunnel replaced the Federal Aid Highway Bridge, a drawbridge opened on August 26, 1926, and closed in 1958. Upon its completion in 1960, it was the only operating public tunnel in Florida (this changed with the completion of the Port of Miami Tunnel in 2014. Two private tunnels exist at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista). Alfred Spear as head of Thorington Construction Company of Providence, R.I., was responsible for the construction of the project.

The tunnel was built after a lengthy debate on whether to construct another bridge or a tunnel. The predecessor drawbridge operated so slowly that it sometimes took motorists 45 minutes to cross from one end of the bridge to the other, creating massive traffic jams in the heart of the city.

In 1986 it was renamed in honor of Henry E. Kinney, who had advocated its construction while he was chief of the Fort Lauderdale/Broward Edition of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; newspaper.

<text>Charalambides is an avant-garde musical group originally from Houston, Texas, United States and lately of Austin, Texas. They were formed in 1991 under the short-lived name Mutual Admiration Society by Tom Carter, Christina Carter and Kyle Silfer, and later members have since included Jason Bill and Heather Leigh Murray. The band has long considered itself primarily a duo between Tom and Christina Carter. Their music contains elements typical of psychedelic music such as reverb, backwards recording, extended instrumental jamming and the use of found sounds, which led to them being described as part of the New Weird America movement. In addition to several major releases on labels such as Kranky, Eclipse Records, and Time-Lag Records, they have also released many small edition CD-Rs on their own Wholly Other label, and other small independent labels, some of which have later been re-issued (&quot;Our Bed is Green&quot;, and &quot;Historic Sixth Ward&quot; for example).

Their name derives from the surname of a customer at the record shop where core members Tom Carter and Christina Carter met, who are divorced but remain together as a musical unit. They have also released albums on Kranky and Eclipse Records under their own names, as well as several small edition CD-Rs. In addition, the two have collaborated with numerous other musicians such as Loren Mazzacane Connors, Yellow Swans and Robert Horton.

<text>In linear algebra, a Block LU decomposition is a matrix decomposition of a block matrix into a lower block triangular matrix &quot;L&quot; and an upper block triangular matrix &quot;U&quot;. This decomposition is used in numerical analysis to reduce the complexity of the block matrix formula.

==Block LDU decomposition==
:formula_1

==Block Cholesky decomposition==
Consider a block matrix:
:formula_2
where the matrix formula_3 is assumed to be non-singular,
formula_4 is an identity matrix with proper dimension, and formula_5 is a matrix whose elements are all zero.

We can also rewrite the above equation using the half matrices:
:formula_6
where the Schur complement of formula_3
in the block matrix is defined by
:formula_8 
and the half matrices can be calculated by means of Cholesky decomposition or LDL decomposition.
The half matrices satisfy that
:formula_9

Thus, we have
:formula_10
where
:formula_11

The matrix formula_12 can be decomposed in an algebraic manner into
::formula_13

<doc id="1214234" wikidata="Q1139054" url="?curid=1214234" title="Régional">
<text>Régional Compagnie Aérienne Européenne (often shortened to Régional) was a subsidiary airline wholly owned by Air France which connected hubs at Paris and Lyon to 49 airports in Europe. The airline operated in Air France livery, retaining its name in small titles and logo on the front fuselage and engines. It became the first European operator of the Embraer E190 aircraft in November 2006. It was headquartered in Bouguenais at the Nantes Atlantique Airport.

The airline, along with Brit Air and Airlinair, was fully merged in HOP! since 2017 after a year of negotiation process.

== History ==
On 30 March 2001, Flandre Air, Proteus Airlines, and Regional Airlines merged into Régional.

Régional as of 2006 was upgrading and consolidating its fleet, considering to ally with a turboprop partner as it increasingly turned its focus to its jet operations. The two remaining Saab 2000s were phased out in 2006 and the last of its nine Embraer EMB-120s followed in 2008, marking the exit of all of Régional&#x27;s turboprop aircraft.

From 31 March 2013, Régional services were operated under the HOP! brand. Régional ceased all flight operations in March 2017 after its merger in HOP!.

== Fleet ==
The Régional fleet includes the following aircraft in March 2013, the average fleet age is 12.3 years.
It became the first European operator of the Embraer E190 on 23 November 2006, when the first of six on order was delivered. The 100-seat aircraft would operate domestic and intra-European services in full Air France colours. Régional received its first Embraer E170 of 6 orders, which wears the new Régional logo, on September 2, 2008.

The Embraer E190s are part of a new order over the Air France-KLM group with another 18 further options. All Fokkers have been transferred to KLM Cityhopper. The last propeller aircraft Embraer EMB-120 left the fleet on October 10, 2008, replaced by the ERJ-135.

==Head office==

The head office of the airline was located on the grounds of Nantes Atlantique Airport in Bouguenais, near Nantes. The head office was adjacent to the airport hotels. Nantes Atlantique Airport had the head office of Regional Airlines, the largest of the three companies that were merged into the new Régional.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 25 January 2007, Air France Flight 7775 from Pau to Paris, operated by Régional, crashed shortly after take-off. All 54 passengers and crew escaped from the Fokker 100 although one person was killed on the ground. An investigation by the BEA revealed that the cause of the accident was ice on the wings of the aircraft involved.

<text>Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant is the fourth album from the Scottish group Belle &amp; Sebastian released in 2000.

==Background and recording==
While promoting their third studio album &quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; (1998), Belle and Sebastian made their TV debut on 20 November 1999, appearing on &quot;Apocalypse Tube&quot;. Shortly afterwards, on New Year&#x27;s Day 2000, they previewed songs that were set to appear on their next album.

Stuart Murdoch recalled that this album felt more difficult to make than prior albums. Musically the songs were more complex and &quot;demanded a pop precision that you just couldn’t skirt around&quot; requiring the group to practice and refine things more than they had traditionally.

The band introduced many stylistic changes on this album, such as an organic strings section and more songs with lead vocals by other members of the band; Sarah Martin sings on &quot;Waiting for the Moon to Rise&quot;, Isobel Campbell sings on &quot;Family Tree&quot;, and performs duets with Stevie Jackson on &quot;Beyond the Sunrise&quot; and Stuart Murdoch on &quot;Women&#x27;s Realm&quot;. Jackson also sings lead vocal on &quot;The Wrong Girl&quot; and duets with Murdoch on &quot;The Model&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave the Light On Baby&quot;. It is the last Belle &amp; Sebastian album to feature bass player Stuart David, who departed the band after the album&#x27;s completion.

==Artwork and title==
The twin sisters pictured on the cover are Icelandic musicians Gyða and Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir, both from the band Múm.

Within the album&#x27;s photography collection are pictures of two books, &quot;Beyond the Sunrise&quot; and &quot;I Fought in a War&quot;. Both books are titles of songs on the album, but the books are fictional creations of Murdoch&#x27;s. Due to the band&#x27;s interest in literature, fans have tried to locate the books that they believed had &quot;inspired&quot; the songs. Belle &amp; Sebastian have informed fans about the fictive nature of the books on the &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; section of their website.

The album&#x27;s title comes from a piece of graffiti on a public toilet wall Stuart Murdoch had seen years earlier and remembered.

==Reception==
The album was released to generally favourable reviews. &quot;Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant&quot; debuted at No. 80 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has sold 113,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<text>Alphonsus Edward &quot;Phonse&quot; Kyne (29 October 1915 – 8 April 1985) was an Australian rules footballer who played for and coached Collingwood in the Victorian Football League. He is an inductee of the Australian Football Hall of Fame and a member of the official Collingwood Team of the Century. Along with Allan La Fontaine, he is widely regarded as one of the two best footballers to graduate from St Kevin&#x27;s College, Toorak.

== Playing career ==
A centre half-forward and ruckman during his playing career, Kyne was a member of Collingwood premiership sides in 1935 and 1936.

He won his first best and fairest in 1946, winning the award again the following two seasons to become the first player to win the Copeland Trophy three years in succession. Kyne had his first stint as captain in 1942 before being appointed to the role permanently from 1946 to 1949. He had served in the Australian Army (22nd Battalion) between 1942 and 1945.

A regular Victorian interstate representative, Kyne played a total of 11 games for the state and captaining them at the 1947 Hobart Carnival.

== Coaching career ==
In 1950, Kyne was appointed coach of Collingwood and took the field seven times that season before becoming a non-playing coach from 1951 onwards. His 272 games as coach is the second most by a Collingwood player, and he was a premiership-winning coach in 1953 and 1958.

== In popular culture ==
Collingwood historian Michael Roberts speculated that Kyne is one of three Collingwood footballers depicted in John Brack&#x27;s 1953 painting &quot;Three of the Players&quot;.

<doc id="1214242" wikidata="Q1136047" url="?curid=1214242" title="Torch song">
<text>A torch song is a sentimental love song, typically one in which the singer laments an unrequited or lost love, either where one party is oblivious to the existence of the other, where one party has moved on, or where a romantic affair has affected the relationship. The term comes from the saying, &quot;to carry a torch for someone&quot;, or to keep aflame the light of an unrequited love. It was first used by the cabaret singer Tommy Lyman in his praise of &quot;My Melancholy Baby&quot;. 

The term is also explicitly cited in the song &quot;Jim&quot;, popularized by versions by Dinah Shore, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald: 
Torch-singing is more of a niche than a genre and can stray from the traditional jazz-influenced style of singing; the American tradition of the torch song typically relies upon the melodic structure of the blues. Examples of a collection are Billie Holiday&#x27;s 1955 album &quot;Music for Torching&quot; and &quot;Entre eux deux&quot; by Melody Gardot and Philippe Powell.

<doc id="1214243" wikidata="Q7893240" url="?curid=1214243" title="United States v. Carolene Products Co.">
<text>United States v. Carolene Products Company, 304 U.S. 144 (1938), was a case of the United States Supreme Court that upheld the federal government&#x27;s power to prohibit filled milk from being shipped in interstate commerce. In his majority opinion for the Court, Associate Justice Harlan F. Stone wrote that economic regulations were &quot;presumptively constitutional&quot; under a deferential standard of review known as the &quot;rational basis test&quot;.

The case is most notable for Footnote Four, in which Stone wrote that the Court would exercise a stricter standard of review when a law appears on its face to violate a provision of the United States Constitution, restricts the political process in a way that could impede the repeal of an undesirable law, or discriminates against &quot;discrete and insular&quot; minorities. Footnote Four would influence later Supreme Court decisions, and the higher standard of review is now known as &quot;strict scrutiny&quot;.

== Background ==
The case dealt with a federal law that prohibited filled milk (skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat to resemble milk or cream) from being shipped in interstate commerce. The defendant, a company that traded in a form of filled milk consisting of condensed skim milk and coconut oil (which the company labeled &quot;Milnot&quot; or &quot;Milnut&quot;), argued that the law was unconstitutional because of both the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause.

In its previous term, the Court had dramatically increased the number of activities considered to be in or to affect interstate commerce. It had also altered its settled jurisprudence in the area of substantive due process, the doctrine dealing with rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. The changes meant that many New Deal programs that the Court would previously have struck down as unconstitutional would now be found constitutional.

The defendant company, charged with breaking the law, at trial filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois granted the defendant&#x27;s motion, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court&#x27;s ruling.

==Decision==
Justice Harlan Stone, writing for the Court, held that the law was &quot;presumptively constitutional&quot; properly within legislative discretion. It was not for the courts to overrule because it was supported by substantial public-health evidence and was not arbitrary or irrational. In other words, the Court applied a &quot;rational basis&quot; test.

==Footnote Four==
&quot;Carolene Products&quot; is best known for its Footnote Four, which is considered to be &quot;the most famous footnote in constitutional law.&quot; Although the Court had applied minimal scrutiny (rational basis review) to the economic regulation in this case, Footnote Four reserved for other types of cases other, stricter standards of review.

Stone said that legislation aimed at &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot; without the normal protections of the political process would be one exception to the presumption of constitutionality and justify a heightened standard of judicial review. The idea has greatly influenced jurisprudence on the Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence and judicial review. It recapitulated common law jurisprudence by which evidence of fraud or other significant legal defects in the transaction, such as self-dealing or other impropriety, may justify overturning a rule.

Louis Lusky, Stone&#x27;s law clerk during the 1937 term, helped draft Footnote Four. The constitutional law scholar John Hart Ely based his major work, &quot;Democracy and Distrust,&quot; on Footnote Four&#x27;s second and third paragraphs, which correspond to the &quot;Democracy&quot; and &quot;Distrust&quot; of his title.

===Text===
===Significance===
In keeping with the New Deal Revolution, &quot;Carolene Products&quot; applies the &quot;rational basis test&quot; to economic legislation. An extremely low standard of judicial review, there is a presumption that the legislation in question is constitutional and the challenging party must show that the law fails the test. Most legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures that deals with economic regulation falls under rational basis review and, therefore, must only be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. However, &quot;Carolene Products&quot; is most famous for Footnote Four.

Footnote Four describes certain legislative acts that might give rise to a higher level of scrutiny. If a law:

# appears on its face to violate a provision of the US Constitution, especially in the Bill of Rights,
# restricts the political process that could repeal an undesirable law, such as restricting voting rights, organizing, disseminating information etc., or
# discriminates against &quot;discrete and insular&quot; minorities, especially racial, religious, and national minorities and particularly those who lack sufficient numbers or power to seek redress through the political process.

This higher level of scrutiny, now called &quot;strict scrutiny&quot;, was applied to strike down an inmate forced sterilization law in &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot; (1942) and in Justice Black&#x27;s infamous opinion in &quot;Korematsu v. U.S.&quot; (1944) in which Japanese internment was upheld despite being subject to heightened scrutiny. Under strict scrutiny, a law will be struck down unless it serves a compelling governmental interest and is necessary to achieve that end, which means that less restrictive alternatives to the law must be considered by the government even if there is a compelling interest. Therefore, the law must be narrowly tailored to serve the governmental interest and employ the least restrictive alternative.

Intermediate scrutiny, which is often applied in gender discrimination cases, did not arise until decades later. When applied, the law must serve an important governmental interest and be substantially related to that end.

Some argue that the &quot;most famous footnote&quot; was in fact written by not Stone but his law clerk, Louis Lusky. In fact, the cited work above, while quite useful on the origin and growth of the footnote, does not claim that the law clerk was the author, and it implies the opposite, based on letters between the justices. In his later work, &quot;Our Nine Tribunes: The Supreme Court in Modern America&quot;, however, Lusky includes facsimiles of the original drafts of the footnote, the first of which is in his own hand. Stone edited the second, typed draft, and at the behest of the Chief Justice, he added certain passages.

<text>Willie Anderson (born 3 April 1955) is a rugby union coach and former Ireland international. A lock, Anderson was capped 27 times for the national side between 1984 and 1990, some of which as captain. In one notable appearance as captain against the All Blacks, Anderson led his side into a confrontation with their opponents while they were performing the haka.

While on a 1980 tour in Buenos Aires, Anderson was imprisoned for three months by the Argentinian authorities after attempting to smuggle a flag from a government building. He was later cleared of &quot;demeaning a patriotic symbol&quot;.

In a memorable moment, Anderson along with his French rugby counterpart Jean Condom, unwittingly became the subject of an amusing banner spotted by TV cameras in the crowd during a 5 Nations rugby match at Lansdowne Road in Ireland&#x27;s championship campaign of 1985. The banner proudly read &#x27;Our Willie&#x27;s bigger than your Condom!&#x27;. Willie is also the father of fashion designer Jonathan Anderson who designed the Super Bowl performance outfit worn by the singer Rihanna in February 2023.

He attended Omagh Academy.

==Coaching==
After retiring he became assistant coach of Leinster and later the Scottish national team, both under head coach Matt Williams. After a spell as a full-time physical education teacher and rugby coach at Grosvenor Grammar School and later at Sullivan Upper School, Anderson was appointed head coach of Rainey Old Boys in July 2007.

Anderson coaches Coolmine R.F.C.&#x27;s senior first XV. They play in Division 1 of the Leinster League. On 22 March 2011, Willie Anderson led Sullivan Upper School to their second Medallion Shield Victory defeating Limavady Grammar School 17–0.

<text>The Battle of Manimani was a failed American landing attempt west of Bahia Honda, Cuba. On July 23, 1898, the U.S.S. &quot;Wanderer&quot; was disabled at the mouth of the Manimani River, after Spanish forces opened fire and shot two men. The ship eventually reached safety after Lieutenant John Heard took their position and transmitted orders to the engine room.

It was one of the final engagements of the Spanish–American War in Cuba.

==Background==
On July 23, 1898, Lieutenant John Heard anchored his force at the mouth of the Mani-Mani River and began unloading supplies intended for the Cuban insurgents operating in northwestern Cuba, unaware that the Spanish had discovered his presence and assembled a large force of cavalry in the environs.

==Battle==
Catching the Americans off guard, Spanish cavalry advanced out onto the beach and opened fire upon the landing parties. Heard ordered his men to take cover and return fire. Pounded by accurate American volleys, the Spanish withdrew back into the jungle.

Lieutenant Heard used the temporary respite to order an immediate retreat, evacuating his wounded into the USS &quot;Wanderer&quot; and preparing to lift anchor just as the Spaniards reappeared, unleashing a hail of fire at those on the deck.

==Aftermath==
John Heard was awarded a Medal of Honor on June 21, 1899, for his actions at Manimani. The award noted:After two men had been shot down by Spaniards while transmitting orders to the engine-room on the &quot;Wanderer&quot;, the ship having become disabled, this officer took the position held by them and personally transmitted the orders, remaining at his post until the ship was out of danger.

<text>The Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) is a research institute located in Shimla, India. It was set up by the Ministry of Education, Government of India in 1964 and started functioning from 20 October 1965. It is currently housed in the Rashtrapati Niwas.

==History and establishment==
The building that houses the institute was originally built as a home for Lord Dufferin, Viceroy of India from 1884 to 1888, and was called the Viceregal Lodge. It housed all the subsequent viceroys and governors-general of India. It occupies Observatory Hill, one of the seven hills that Shimla is built upon.
The building was designed by Henry Irwin, an architect in the Public Works Department. The Viceregal Lodge had electricity as early as 1888, much before the rest of the town of Shimla. The building also was equipped with a sophisticated firefighting mechanism through wax-tipped water ducts.

Many historic decisions were taken in the building during the Indian independence movement. The Simla Conference, to discuss self-rule for India, was held here in 1945. The decision to carve out Pakistan and East Pakistan from India was also taken here in 1947.

After India gained independence, the building was renamed as Rashtrapati Niwas and was used as a summer retreat for the president of India. However, due to its neglect, Dr. S Radhakrishnan decided to turn it into a centre of higher learning. The summer retreat of the president was shifted from here to a building known as &quot;The Retreat&quot; situated in Chharabra, on the outskirts of Shimla.

The Indian Institute of Advanced Study was first created as a society on 6 October 1964. The institute was formally inaugurated by Prof. S. Radhakrishnan on 20 October 1965. The eminent historian, professor Niharranjan Ray, was appointed as the first director of the institute.

Around 2004, a rare stické court was discovered on the grounds of the Viceregal Lodge complex.

A bell made of eight metals which was presented by the king of Nepal was available to be admired by tourists until it was stolen in April 2010.

The lawn in front of the lodge is above a water tank. All the rainwater from the building goes to this water tank. This rainwater harvesting system goes back to the 19th century when this building was designed.

The Institute of Advance Studies was the first electrified building in Shimla. This electricity was produced by steam engines which were brought from Britain.

Chandrakala Padia was the first women chairperson of IIAS.

==Administration==
The institute is administered by a Society and a Governing Body, the members of which come from varied backgrounds. A statutory Finance Committee advises the Governing Body in financial matters.

The director of the institute is assisted by a secretary, a deputy secretary a public relations officer and other supervisory staff.

==Academics==

==Fellowship==
The institute has two fellowship programs National Fellows and Fellows. The term National Fellows at the institute is for a maximum period of two years. For Fellows, the backbone of the institute, the duration of regular fellowships ranges from a minimum of six months to a maximum of two years. This depends on the nature of work and its progress. Initially, a fellowship is awarded for a year.

While fellows of the institute are primarily engaged in their own research on themes approved by the institute, the considerable formal and informal interaction amongst them encourages a healthy interdisciplinary dialogue. From April to November, the fellows&#x27; weekly seminar is the primary forum for formal interaction. During their term, fellows remain in residence from April to November. From December to March, they may engage in field work, library and archival consultations outside Shimla. Upon the completion of their term, fellows are required to submit their completed research work in the form of a monograph to the institute. The monographs submitted by them are considered for publication by the Institute – which also retains the first right of publication.

=== Visiting professors, visiting scholars and guest scholars ===
Apart from fellows, other scholars also contribute to, and benefit from, the institute. They come as visiting professors, visiting scholars and guest scholars. Visiting professors are eminent scholars invited by the Governing Body of the institute to deliver lectures and give seminars at the institute. During an in-residence stay of up to four weeks, they also interact informally with fellows of the institute. Similarly, visiting scholars also come to the institute on invitation. Like visiting professors, they too are distinguished in their respective fields, but their stay is limited to a week and all facilities of the institute are extended to them. Guest scholars visit the Institute – subject to the availability of accommodation; they too are welcome to utilize the facilities on a nominal payment. The visiting professors to IIAS includes a large number of philosophers which include Prof. Kanchana Natarajan, and Prof. Enakshi Ray Mitra.

==The International Centre for Human Development (IC4HD)==
The International Centre for Human Development (IC4HD) is set up in IIAS to support efforts by governments of the South to integrate human development approaches and ensure improved development outcomes for poor and marginalized people. The IC4HD center was inaugurated on 19 August 2013 in the institute with the aim to promote policy dialogue on human development in the Global South and work towards translating human development analysis into action. The partnership between the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was officially launched at an event held in Delhi on 4 January 2013. The centre will provide a range of services to national governments in translating human development approach into policy through a four-pronged approach viz. Policy Advisory Services, South-South Cooperation, Research on HD issues and Monitoring and Evaluation.

==Tagore Centre==
On the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) was awarded the Tagore Centre for the Study of Culture and Civilization by the HRD Ministry of Government of India.

Activities of the Tagore Centre
* There are four fellows in residence at the Centre every year. None of the fellows are permanent and their term is for a minimum of six months to a maximum of two years. They enjoy facilities similar to those enjoyed by the fellows of IIAS. One of the fellows may be either a poet, or a writer, or an artist-in-residence as a tribute to Tagore&#x27;s multifaceted personality. Another may be a scholar from outside India. The fellows are known as Tagore Fellows.
* An annual International Seminar on some aspect of Tagore&#x27;s concerns is proposed to be conducted. This will preferably not be of an exegetical nature but more an engagement with his substantial concerns as stated in the vision document.
* A study week on Tagore&#x27;s works would be organized every alternate year.
* An artist camp could perhaps be organized every alternate year.
* An annual Tagore Lecture would be organized.
==IIAS Library==
Established in 1965, the library has been established to facilitate, promote and support research to Fellows of the institute. It is one of the leading research and reference libraries in Humanities and Social Science in the country. .The social science collections, in fact, are worldwide in coverage and significance.
==Publications==
The institute has published over 450 works. These include monographs submitted by its fellows; edited proceedings of seminars, symposia, workshops and conferences held at the institute; lectures given by visiting professors; and occasional papers presented by fellows and visitors to the institute.

The institute also publishes two academic journals. Their review journal, &quot;Summerhill: IIAS Review&quot;, carries reviews of books published by the institute and those received from outside, as well as interviews and important information about the various academic activities of the institute. A biannual journal, &quot;Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences&quot;, is published under the auspices of the Inter-University Centre for Humanities and Social Sciences.

<doc id="1214268" wikidata="Q269654" url="?curid=1214268" title="Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula">
<text>The Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula (; ), usually shortened to the Cathedral of St. Gudula or St. Gudula by locals, is a medieval Catholic cathedral in central Brussels, Belgium. It is dedicated to Saint Michael and Saint Gudula, the patron saints of the City of Brussels, and is considered to be one of the finest examples of Brabantine Gothic architecture.

The Romanesque church&#x27;s construction began in the 11th century, replacing an earlier chapel, and was largely complete in its current Gothic form by the 16th, though its interior was frequently modified in the following centuries. The building includes late-Gothic and Baroque chapels, whilst its neo-Gothic decorative elements, including some of its stained glass windows in the aisles, date from restoration work in the 19th century. St. Gudula also stands out for its musical components, notably its two pipe organs and its immense church bells. The complex was designated a historic monument in 1936.

The church was elevated to cathedral status in 1962 and has since been the co-cathedral of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Mechelen–Brussels, together with St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral in Mechelen. As the national church of Belgium and the Primate of Belgium&#x27;s official seat, it frequently hosts royal weddings, state funerals and other official ceremonies, such as the &quot;Te Deum&quot; on Belgian National Day.

Since the mid-20th century, following the construction of the North–South connection, St. Gudula has been situated on the /, a large forecourt east of the /. This area is served by Brussels-Central railway station, as well as by Parc/Park metro station on lines 1 and 5 of the Brussels Metro.

==History==

===Early history===
The cathedral&#x27;s origins are obscure, but historians agree that, as early as the 9th century, a chapel dedicated to Saint Michael probably stood in its place, on what was the most important point of Brussels at the time; the crossroads of two major trade routes—a first one connecting the County of Flanders and Cologne, and another between Antwerp and Mons, then France. These crossroads were located on the &quot;Treurenberg&quot; hill (; &quot;Mount of sorrows&quot;), where the St. Gudula Gate stood (integrated in the first city walls), and which was later used as an ominously famous prison, hence its name.

In the 11th century, this first chapel was replaced by a Romanesque church. In 1047, Lambert II, Count of Leuven, and his wife Oda of Verdun, founded a chapter in this church, and organised the transportation to it of the relics of the martyr Saint Gudula, which were housed before then in Saint Gaugericus&#x27; Church on Saint-Géry Island (where today&#x27;s / are located). In 1072, the church was reconsecrated, probably following a fire.

At the end of the 12th century, a Romanesque avant-corps was added to the west of the nave. In the 13th century, Henry I, Duke of Brabant, ordered two round towers to be added to the church. His son, Henry II, Duke of Brabant, instructed the building of a Brabantine Gothic collegiate church in 1226. The choir was constructed between 1226 and 1276. The nave and transept date from the 14th and 16th centuries. The entire church took about 300 years to complete. The main structure was finalised just before Emperor Charles V&#x27;s reign began in 1519.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the church underwent several modifications, the most remarkable of which was the addition of some chapels: the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament of the Miracle (1534–1539), the Chapel of Our Lady of Deliverance (1649–1655) and the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalen (also called the Maes Chapel) (1672–1675). On 6 June 1579, the collegiate church was pillaged and wrecked by Protestant &quot;Geuzen&quot; (&quot;Beggars&quot;), and Saint Gudula&#x27;s relics were disinterred and scattered. In the 1790s, it also suffered looting and destruction by French revolutionaries known as the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, including the loss of its original carillon.

===19th century–present===
The church was designated a historic monument on 5 March 1936. In the mid-20th century, it was narrowly spared during the building of the North–South connection, a major railway link through central Brussels. On that occasion, a large forecourt, known as the /, was built in front of it. It was not until 1962, with the creation of the Archdiocese of Mechelen–Brussels, that the collegiate church was promoted to the rank of co-cathedral, when it became the Archbishop&#x27;s seat, together with St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral in Mechelen. The church&#x27;s current patron saints, Saint Michael and Saint Gudula, are also those of the City of Brussels.

Restoration work was carried out in the 19th century under the direction of the architect Tilman-François Suys who, from 1839 to 1845, restored the towers and portals, and again in the 20th century under the direction of Jean Rombaux, then Victor Gaston Martiny, chief architect-town planner of the Province of Brabant and member of the Royal Committee for Monuments and Sites. The cathedral was once again thoroughly restored between 1983 and 1999. On those occasions, archaeological excavations were undertaken, which led to the discovery of remains of the Romanesque church and crypt underneath the current choir.

==Description==
Most of the cathedral is in the Brabantine Gothic style, although some parts are in the newer Baroque style. It is traditionally listed, alongside the Church of Our Lady of the Chapel and the Church of Our Lady of Victories at the Sablon, as one of the three Gothic churches still standing in central Brussels. The cathedral is built of stone from the Gobertange quarry, which is located in present-day Walloon Brabant, approximately south-east of the cathedral&#x27;s site.

The building adopts the classic plan: a Latin cross with a three-bay long choir ending in a five-sided apse surrounded by an ambulatory. It is imposing by its sheer size: long, wide ( at the level of the choir), and high (the entrance towers reach a height of ).

==Exterior==

===Main façade and towers===
The main (western) façade with its three portals surmounted by gables and two towers are typical of the French Gothic style, but without a rose window, as it features instead a large ogival window in the Brabantine Gothic style. The whole structure is supported by sturdy flying buttresses with double spans, influenced by Soissons Cathedral, crowned by pinnacles and gargoyles.

The two towers, built between 1470 and 1485, the upper parts of which are arranged in terraces, are attributed to Jan Van Ruysbroeck, the court architect of Philip the Good, who also designed the tower of Brussels&#x27; Town Hall and the Collegiate Church of St. Peter and St. Guido in Anderlecht. They appear to be unfinished, lacking the spires seen in other Gothic cathedrals, and were originally meant to be much higher, in a style close to the Town Hall&#x27;s tower or the north tower of the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp. They nonetheless remain a prominent feature in the skyline of downtown Brussels.

The strong predominance of the vertical lines of this façade is impressive; four robust buttresses close and separate the three portals. The two at the ends become more important by integrating two tall buttressed turrets that rise from the base to the top of the towers themselves. Furthermore, the façade is divided horizontally into three levels: a lower one entirely centred on the three portals; a median one opened by the large multi-light window flanked by two high three-light windows, each inscribed in the axis of one of the towers; and an upper one characterised by the large triangular tympanum which, developing from a gallery with fine columns, is topped by several flaming pinnacles, of which the central, more imposing, reaches a height of .

===Chapels===
From the transept, on each side of the choir, two large late-Gothic chapels, added in the 16th century (for the northern Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament of the Miracle), and the 17th century (for the southern Chapel of Our Lady of Deliverance), protrude. The large proportion of these chapels gives the impression that the building has three choirs. Behind the apse, on the church&#x27;s central axis, the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalen (also called the Maes Chapel), in Baroque style, was inserted in 1672–1675 between the buttresses, with an octagonal plan with a dome and lantern.

===Staircase and forecourt===
The monumental staircase in front of the cathedral, designed by Pieter Paul Merckx, was placed in the period 1702–1707. This staircase, a gift from the City of Brussels, was originally built against the city walls to provide access to the promenade on the stretch between the Laeken Gate and the Schaerbeek Gate.

In the centre of the gardens located in front of the cathedral&#x27;s forecourt stands a bust of King Baudouin. It is the work of the sculptor . The bust was completed on 6 June 1996, and remained at the city&#x27;s administrative centre until road works on the / were completed. It was integrated into its current environment in 2003–04, as part of the renovation of this green space. It was vandalised in June 2020, following the George Floyd protests in Belgium.

==Interior==

===Nave===
The nave possesses all the characteristics of Brabantine Gothic; the four-part vaults are moderately high and the robust cylindrical columns that line the nave&#x27;s central aisle are topped with capitals in the shape of cabbage leaves. Statues of the twelve apostles are attached to the columns. These statues date from the 17th century and were created by Lucas Faydherbe, Jerôme Duquesnoy the Younger, Johannes van Mildert and Tobias de Lelis, all renowned sculptors of their time. The statues replaced those destroyed by iconoclasts in 1566. The nave also contains a Baroque pulpit from the 17th century, made by the Antwerp sculptor Hendrik Frans Verbruggen in 1699. The base represents Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden of Eden after plucking the forbidden fruit. At the top, the Madonna and Child piercing the serpent symbolise redemption.

To the right of the portal of the northern transept is an elegant 17th-century sculpture depicting &quot;The education of the Holy Virgin by Saint Anna&quot; by Jerôme Duquesnoy the Younger after a painting by Rubens. The side aisles contain 17th-century oak confessionals formerly attributed to the sculptor Jan van Delen. The cathedral also contains the unmarked burial place of Dermot O&#x27;Mallun, the last Irish-born chief of the name of the O&#x27;Moloney sept of Thomond.

===Choir and chapels===
The choir is Gothic and has three rectangular bays and a five-sided apse. It also contains the mausoleums of the Dukes of Brabant and Archduke Ernest of Austria made by Robert Colyn de Nole in the 17th century. Its elevation is on three levels; large arcades communicating with the ambulatory, triforium and high windows.

Left of the choir is the Flamboyant Gothic Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament of the Miracle (1534–1539). It now houses the Treasure of the Cathedral, where the famous Drahmal Cross (also known as the Brussels Cross), an early 11th-century Anglo-Saxon inscribed cross-reliquary, is stored. Jean Micault, receiver general of Charles V, and his wife, Livine Cats van Welle, were buried there, and an altarpiece, probably commissioned by their son Nicolas, was dedicated to them. It was made by the Renaissance painter and tapestry designer Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen. This triptych is now in the collections of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.

Right of the choir is the Chapel of Our Lady of Deliverance (1649–1655), which was built in a late Gothic style and contains a Baroque altar by Jan Voorspoel (1666). Behind the choir is a Baroque chapel dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen (also called the Maes Chapel) dated 1672–1675, and a marble and alabaster altarpiece depicting the Passion of Christ by the sculptor Jean Mone dated 1538.

==Stained glass==
The cathedral has stained glass windows from the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries; most of which date from between 1525 and 1663. Particularly noteworthy is the large window in the western façade representing the Last Judgement. It was made in 1528 by the Antwerp glassmaker Jan Haeck, based on drawings by Bernard van Orley.

Haeck and Van Orley were also responsible for the windows adorning the northern and southern transepts. The northern window dates from 1537 and represents Charles V and his wife Isabella of Portugal in adoration for the Holy Sacrament and accompanied by their patron saints Charlemagne and Elizabeth of Hungary. The southern window dates from 1538 and represents Charles&#x27; brother-in-law, Louis II of Hungary, with his wife Mary of Hungary in adoration for the Holy Trinity and accompanied by Saint Louis and the Virgin Mary.

The Chapel of Our Lady of Deliverance is decorated with stained glass windows by the glass painter Jean De Labaer, based on drawings by Theodoor van Thulden, one of Rubens&#x27;s pupils. These windows, created between 1654 and 1663, describe the main episodes in the life of the Virgin Mary.

Also worth mentioning are the impressive series of fifteen stained glass windows from the 19th century in the aisles, produced by Jean-Baptiste Capronnier. They were created in 1870 for the celebration of the fifth centenary of the Sacrament of Miracle, an antisemitic canard of host desecration. In 1977, then-Cardinal of Mechelen–Brussels, Leo Joseph Suenens, installed a plaque in the cathedral disavowing the 1370 events.

==Organs==
The large pipe organ in the nave was inaugurated in October 2000. It hangs as a swallow&#x27;s nest organ at the level of the triforium, and has a total of 4300 pipes, 63 stops, 4 keyboards and the pedal-board. This instrument is the work of the German organ-builder Gerhard Grenzing, based in Barcelona, in collaboration with the English architect Simon Platt.

The two-manual choir organ was created in 1977 in the workshop of the organ-builder .

==Bells==
Both towers contain bells. The south tower contains a 49-bell carillon from 1966 by the Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry, on which Sunday concerts are often given. Out of all the bells in the carillon, only seven of them can ring. They are, from heaviest to lightest: Fabiola, Maria, Michael, Gudula, Philippe, Astrid, and Laurent. Fabiola, Philippe, Astrid and Laurent are named after members of the Belgian royal family.

The north tower contains a single bourdon called &quot;Salvator, it&quot; was cast by Peter van den Gheyn in 1638. There is also another empty space where a second bourdon used to be. The bourdon has a deep crankshaft, but counterweights have already been removed. There are plans to hang it again on a straight axis with a flying clapper.

==Trivia==

===Falcons in the cathedral===
At the end of the 1990s, local ornithologists discovered a couple of peregrine falcons roosting on top of the cathedral&#x27;s towers. In 2001, ornithologists of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS) in association with the (FIR), a French association dedicated to the protection of raptors, installed a laying-nest on the edifice in an attempt to encourage nest-building. This laying-nest was never used, but in the spring of 2004, a pair of falcons nested on a balcony on top of the cathedral&#x27;s northern tower. At the beginning of March, the female laid three eggs.

As a result of watching the three chicks perform acrobatic feats on the cathedral&#x27;s gargoyles, at the end of May 2004, the project &quot;Falcons for everyone&quot; was developed by the RBINS in association with the . The project installed cameras with a live video stream on their website.

==Administration==
The Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula serves as the co-cathedral of the Archbishop of Mechelen–Brussels, the Primate of Belgium, who is currently Archbishop Luc Terlinden. Due to its location in the national capital, it is often used for Catholic ceremonies of national interest, such as royal marriages and state funerals. For example, in 1999, it was the setting for the wedding of Prince Philippe and Mathilde d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz. Other official ceremonies organised in the cathedral include the &quot;Te Deum&quot; on Belgian National Day, attended by the king and other dignitaries.

<text>The Lantingji Xu (), or Lanting Xu (&quot;Orchid Pavilion Preface&quot;), is a piece of Chinese calligraphy work generally considered to be written by the well-known calligrapher Wang Xizhi (303–361) from the Eastern Jin dynasty (317–420).

In the ninth year of the Emperor Yonghe (353 CE), a Spring Purification Ceremony was held at Lanting, Kuaiji Prefecture (today&#x27;s Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province), where Wang was appointed as the governor at the time. During the event, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a &quot;winding stream&quot; drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water downstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, he had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot;, as a preface to the collection was produced by Wang on the spot. The original preface was long lost, but multiple copies with ink on papers or stone inscriptions remain until today.

==Form and content==
The &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; was written in the running (or semi-cursive) style on a cocoon paper with a weasel-whisker brush. It consists of 324 characters in 28 columns. The script of the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; was often celebrated as the high point of the running style in the history of Chinese calligraphy. The improvisational work demonstrated Wang&#x27;s extraordinary calligraphy skill with the elegant and fluent strokes in a coherent spirit throughout the entire preface. The character &quot;Zhi&quot; (“之”) also appeared 20 times but was never written the same way.

Not only the aesthetic form of the manuscript is highly appreciated but also the transcendent sentiments expressed in the preface about life and death is a timeless classic. The preface starts off with a delightful description of the pleasant surroundings and the joyful ceremony, but carries on to reveal melancholy feelings towards how the transient delights brought by the vast universe would soon turn into retrospection. Wang reckoned the same emotion would be shared by the ancestors and his future generations even though the world and circumstances would be different. Scholars who study Wang, refer to his ideology expressed in the preface as a fusion of the Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism.

== Original and copies of the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; ==

The original of the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; was told to be completed by Wang in the state of insobriety. Wang tried to rewrite the preface but failed to create the same sublime beauty as the first time. When it came to the reign of the second Emperor from the Tang dynasty (618–907), Emperor Taizong (598?–649) was an admirer of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy and he had collected approximately two-thousand pieces of Wang&#x27;s works. His tracking of the original &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; became a widely circulated anecdote – the Emperor’s senior court official Xiao Yi was tasked to acquire the original from Bian Cai, a monk who inherited Wang&#x27;s &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; from the friar Zhi Yong, the seventh grandson of Wang. Xiao managed to gain the trust from the monk and successfully spirited away the original work (Figure 1). The overjoyed Emperor shortly requested several court officials and calligraphers to copy the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; and upon Taizong&#x27;s death, the original was said to have been buried together in his mausoleum in Shaanxi Province.

Today, among the existing copies of the preface, a few outstanding imitations were attributed to Feng Chengsu (617–672), Ouyang Xun (557–641), Yu Shinan (558–638) and Chu Suiliang (596–659) from the Tang dynasty. Feng&#x27;s version, also called the &quot;Shenlong&quot; version (Figure 2), was regarded as the closest resemblance to the original. Feng, as the royal copyist, mastered the calligraphy tracing technique which was named Xiang Tuo. The method requires the copyist to stay in a dark room and stick the artwork against a window where the sunlight can shine through the paper to expose every detail of the characters; Another empty paper is then attached to the original piece to trace the outline of each stroke meticulously before filling in with ink. The &quot;Shenlong&quot; version is currently preserved at the Palace Museum in Beijing.

==Authenticity of the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot;==
Given that there is not a single piece of original work by Wang&#x27;s own hand which has survived to our time, the authenticity of the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; has been a subject of controversy, particularly from the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) onwards. In the 1960s, the debate about the authenticity of the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; was intensified along with discoveries of more calligraphy rubbings and antique documentations. Much of the debate upon the authenticity of the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; surviving manuscripts is based upon the historical development of Chinese script styles, and whether Wang Xizhi could have written in a calligraphic style which seems to be much more typical of running style script from a time centuries later than Eastern Jin. Some of the answers to questions about authenticity are approached through the means of examining Chinese rubbings from stones carved in various calligraphic styles. Typically the stone inscriptions last much longer than the paper versions, and so may contribute to the general understanding of Chinese script styles, and particularly the role or authenticity of &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; as part of this process.

===Questions of authenticity===
Due to the loss of the original &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot;, questions have been raised as to whether the surviving copies are true copies, or based on a mere reconstruction. The voice of forgery, with a key representative Guo Moruo (1892 – 1978), the first President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, claims the Running Style only matured after the Tang dynasty as the artworks and records around the Han to Jin Dynasty imply a heavy dependence of using the Clerical script (evolved around 300 BCE) instead of the Running style, such examples include the stone inscriptions demonstrated in Figure 3 and 4. Moreover, the earliest anecdotes collection in China &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot; (“A New Account of Tales of the World”), annotated by writer Liu Xiaobiao (463 – 521), asserted that the preface written by Wang was actually named &quot;Linhe Xu&quot; (“The Preface to the Riverside Gathering”). The content of the &quot;Linhe Xu&quot; recorded in the &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;, comparing with the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; manuscript, was shortened by a hundred and sixty-seven characters in the middle paragraph but added on forty more characters at the end. Guo also stated that the emotions manifested in the preface were overly pessimistic for an aristocrat so that it was not a true reflection of Wang’s temperament. As a result, by the early 1970s, the conclusion was almost reached that the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; scroll was a work forged by Wang’s descendant.

===Role of rubbings===
Reproduction of inscriptions on stone (or other depictions on other hard surfaces) through a process of rubbing at the surface, using a combination of ink and paper or other absorbent material, has a long history in China, and has been central to cultural preservation and understanding, including the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot;. The discussion around the Orchid pavilion preface, revived from the 1980s, with supporters of Wang’s &quot;Langtingji Xu&quot; countering the above arguments with rubbing examples such as Figures 5 and 6, suggesting the formation of the Running Style was already complete before Wang’s time. In addition, since the preface was attributed by the later ages to Wang, it is not surprising that more than one name may exist pointing to the same work. In fact, before Liu Xiaobiao’s annotations, the earlier version of the &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot; compiled by the first editor Liu Yiqing (403 – 444) was already referring to the preface by Wang as &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; The revision of the content may also be understood as a common practice applied in historical annotated books like the &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;. When it comes to Wang’s ideology, by the time the preface was created, Wang was in his early fifties and had experienced chaos of the wars and the disintegration of his nation. Hence, some scholars proposed that rather than pessimism, the content should be explained as a reflection of Wang’s Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist influences instead. These arguments, as a result, led to a broader modern recognition that the &quot;Lantingji Xu&quot; was originally produced by Wang.

<text>SKYY vodka is an American vodka spirit produced by the Campari America division of Campari Group of Milan, Italy, formerly SKYY Spirits LLC. SKYY Vodka is 40% ABV or 80 proof, except in Australia and New Zealand where it is 37.5% ABV / 75 Proof and in South Africa where it is 43% ABV / 86 Proof. Its creator, Maurice Kanbar, claims the vodka is nearly congener-free due to its distillation process. That is why the popular company slogan is &quot;Vodka so filtered - we even took the Russia out of it&quot;. The bottle is a cobalt blue with a clear, adhesive label. In 2008, SKYY expanded the SKYY Vodka line with seventeen new flavors, referred to as SKYY Infusions. These SKYY Infusions are made with fruit.

==Brand ownership history==
SKYY vodka was originally sold by SKYY Spirits LLC, established in 1992 by Maurice Kanbar. In 2009 SKYY Spirits LLC was acquired by Campari Group, and in 2012 was renamed Campari America. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Gruppo Campari, and markets not only the vodka line, but other Campari products as well.

==Manufacturing==
Production and bottling of the product was initially outsourced to Frank-Lin Distillers Products in San Jose, California. Bulk ethanol was delivered in railroad tank cars to Frank-Lin&#x27;s railroad siding near the San Jose rail yards. The ethanol was mixed with filtered and deionized water, flavoring was added, and the product was bottled using a 42-head US Bottlers Machinery Company filling machine to ensure uniform product level.

The ethanol was purchased from MGP Ingredients of Atchison, Kansas, a bulk ethanol producer for beverage, industrial, and fuel applications. MGP uses wheat as a feedstock for the process. The distillation plant is in Pekin, Illinois and is currently powered by natural gas, but United States Environmental Protection Agency approval has been requested to convert the plant to burn coal.

After the acquisition of the brand by Gruppo Campari, production was moved to Campari facilities.

==Awards==
The unflavored SKYY won silver medals at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

<doc id="1214293" wikidata="Q1549793" url="?curid=1214293" title="National Party (Uruguay)">
<text>The National Party (, PN) also known as the White Party (), is a major political party in Uruguay. Founded in 1836 by General Manuel Oribe, it is the country&#x27;s oldest active political party, and along with the Colorado Party, its origin dates back to the establishment of Uruguay as an independent state.

Positioned on the centre-right of the political spectrum, the National Party is ideologically liberal, nationalist, Pan-Americanist and humanist. Considering the interim co-government of the &quot;Gobierno del Cerrito&quot; headed by Manuel Oribe, and the Defense Government from Montevideo led by the Colorado Joaquín Suarez, in the middle of the Uruguayan Civil War, and with the exception of the current administration of Luis Lacalle Pou, the PN has ruled the country for 35 years interruptedly throughout its history. Although Manuel Oribe is recognized as the party&#x27;s founder, Aparicio Saravia is considered its idealist and main historical &quot;caudillo&quot;.

The National Party is a defender of decentralization, and its demographic base skews toward people living in rural areas.

== History ==

The identity of the National Party dates back to 10 August 1836, when the then president Manuel Oribe decreed the use of the white banner with the inscription &quot;Defenders of the Laws&quot;, in the battle of Carpintería, Oribe faced the revolutionary army of Fructuoso Rivera and colored badges were used to distinguish between the parties. For this reason, the National Party is also known as the &quot;White Party.&quot;

On 7 July 1872, the first &quot;Program of Principles&quot; was approved, in which respect for freedoms, the maintenance of peace as the supreme good for the Nation, the representation of minorities, the decentralization of the country, the strengthening of justice, and the promotio of education and instruction.

In March 2020, National Party&#x27;s Luis Lacalle Pou was sworn as the new President of Uruguay, meaning Uruguay got the first conservative government after 15 years of left-wing leadership under the Broad Front coalition.

== Ideology and factions ==
Positioned on the center-right of the political spectrum, the Uruguay National Party encompasses both conservative and liberal tendencies. Ideologically, it has been described as liberal, nationalist, Pan-Americanist and humanist. Additionally, in the party there is a lack of internal agreement on social issues such as the legalisation of abortion, euthanasia, the age of criminal responsibility and same-sex marriage. However, over time, several sectors and the party&#x27;s youth wing have demonstrated a favorable position on LGBT rights.

Throughout its history, the National Party has had a strong base of votes in the interior of the country and support from rural voters, due to its historical policy of decentralization of power, compared to the capital&#x27;s centralist and unitary policy of the Colorado Party.

The National Party is composed of numerous sectors that encompass different ideologies that range from the center-right to the right-wing. The three main factions are the centrist and Christian democratic National Alliance, the economic liberal and conservative Herrerism, and the social-liberal Wilsonist Current.

== Electoral history ==

=== Presidential elections ===
==== Note ====
Under the electoral system in place at the time called Ley de Lemas system, each political party could have as many as three presidential candidates. The combined result of the votes for a party&#x27;s candidates determined which party would control the executive branch, and whichever of the winning party&#x27;s candidates finished in first place would be declared President this system was used form the 1942 election until the 1994 election until in 1996, a referendum amended the constitution to restrict each party to a single presidential candidate, effective from the 1999 elections.

=== Parliamentary elections ===
=== National Council of Administration and National Council of Government elections ===
==== Note ====
The National Council of Administration ruling alongside the President of the Republic between 1918 and 1933 and it was re-established as National Council of Government was the ruling body in Uruguay between 1952 and 1967.

<doc id="1214296" wikidata="Q6670718" url="?curid=1214296" title="London Road Fire Station, Manchester">
<text>London Road Fire Station is a former fire station in Manchester, England. It was opened in 1906, on a site bounded by London Road, Whitworth Street, Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street. Designed in the Edwardian Baroque style by Woodhouse, Willoughby and Langham in red brick and terracotta, it cost £142,000 to build and was built by J. Gerrard and Sons of Swinton. It has been a Grade II* listed building since 1974.

In addition to a fire station, the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner&#x27;s court, and a gas-meter testing station. The fire station operated for 80 years, housing the firemen, their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles a few years after its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade&#x27;s wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the fire station became expensive to maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in. The building was the headquarters of the Manchester Fire Brigade until the brigade was replaced by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974. The fire station closed in 1986, since when it has been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals.

It was placed on English Heritage&#x27;s Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010; Manchester City Council served a compulsory purchase order on the fire station&#x27;s owner, Britannia Hotels. Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building after nearly 30 years of dereliction. It was sold to Allied London in 2015 and renovation commenced in 2018 with the building to be redeveloped as a mixed-use comprising leisure and hotel facilities.

==Construction==
In 1897 the Manchester Watch Committee was considering a replacement for its fire station on Jackson&#x27;s Row. A five-man sub-committee was set up and recommended a site on Newton Street. In 1899, George William Parker, who had designed fire stations in Bootle and Belfast, and been referred to as the &quot;architect of the world&#x27;s fire service&quot;, was appointed Chief of the Manchester Fire Brigade and
asked his opinion on the proposal. Parker reported that the site on Newton Street was unsuitable and submitted plans for a fire station on a site bounded by London Road, Whitworth Street, Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street.

Parker&#x27;s proposal was for a 7-bay fire station on a site more than double the size of the one proposed on Newton Street. The choice of London Road was influenced by its proximity to a development of warehouses on Whitworth Street and Princess Street. Parker convinced the city council to choose his proposals rather than those on Newton Street.

A competition, with prizes of £300, £200 and £100 (equivalent to £, £ and £ in 2025) was organised to design the new fire station. The competition drew interest from across the country, attracting 25 entries. The winning entry was by John Henry Woodhouse, George Harry Willoughby and John Langham, a team of local architects. Their design was based closely on Parker&#x27;s initial plans. The fire station was described by &quot;Fire Call&quot; magazine as &quot;the finest fire station in this round world&quot; before construction started.

The fire station was built between 1904 and 1906 at a cost of £142,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025). The building&#x27;s substructure and foundations were built by C. H. Normanton of Manchester. The superstructure was built by Gerrard&#x27;s of Swinton at a cost of £75,360. It was faced with red brick and terracotta by Burmantofts, a common choice for early 20th-century buildings in Manchester as it was cleanable and resisted the pollution and acid rain caused by local industry. Other notable Manchester buildings from this era making use of terracotta include the Midland Hotel, the Refuge Assurance Building, the University of Manchester&#x27;s Sackville Street Building and the Victoria Baths. The building&#x27;s exterior featured sculptural models by John Jarvis Millson representing the functions of the building such as justice, fire and water.

The building had stained glass windows and the interior was decorated with glazed bricks, similar to other public buildings of this era in the city, such as the Victoria Baths. The similarities suggest the influence and adoption of a standard design by Henry Price&#x27;s newly created City Architect&#x27;s Department.

==Operation==

The building was opened on 27 September 1906 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester James Herbert Thewlis. In addition to the fire station, it housed a police station on Whitworth Street, an ambulance station on Minshull Street South, a branch of Williams Deacon&#x27;s Bank at the corner of London Road and Fairfield Street, a coroner&#x27;s court, and a gas-meter testing station on London Road. The coroner&#x27;s court and gas-meter testing station replaced the proposed public library and gym.
The fire station contained flats for 32 firemen and their families and six single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children&#x27;s play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith&#x27;s workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen&#x27;s response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station&#x27;s first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.

The building has a hose tower and a ventilation system designed by Musgrave and Company to prevent the odour from the horses&#x27; stalls entering the firemen&#x27;s living quarters. Fresh air was drawn in through the top of the fire station&#x27;s tower, purified and circulated around the building. When the air reached the end of the circuit, in the stalls, it was extracted from the building. The system meant that the air in the building was replaced every 10 minutes.

During the Second World War, the basement was converted into an air-raid shelter and an extension built in the yard to provide more space in the control room. The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters&#x27; efforts, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.

After the war, the Manchester Fire Brigade was again municipalised, and reorganised. London Road Fire Station was restored as the headquarters of the brigade and became the only fire station serving the city centre. A fire service training centre was established in 1948. At about the same time, the ambulance station closed and was converted into the fire brigade&#x27;s workshops. The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls.

The interior was refurbished in 1955. The exterior had been cleaned every year since the fire station opened, and as a result was in pristine condition when the building celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 6 October 1956.

==Decline==

By the end of the 1960s, maintenance was becoming increasingly expensive, and the building&#x27;s design ill-suited to modern fire appliances. Plans to replace the fire station were put on hold pending the formation of the Greater Manchester Fire Service.

The building has been Grade II* listed since 1974, the same year that the replacement of the Manchester Fire Brigade by the Greater Manchester Fire Service precipitated the relocation of the brigade&#x27;s headquarters to a new facility in Swinton. As part of the reorganisation, London Road became the headquarters of the brigade&#x27;s &quot;E Division&quot;, with the station&#x27;s control room responsible for two divisions covering the City of Manchester, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport and Tameside.

The reorganisation meant the number of appliances was reduced, until only three remained at the station. The control room at London Road closed in 1979, replaced by a single computerised control room at brigade headquarters in Swinton.

In the same year, following the establishment of Greater Manchester Police and a reorganisation of policing in the city, the police station in the building also closed. The closure left the ground floor on the Whitworth Street side empty. The last tenants of the bank section, a firm of solicitors, and the fire brigade&#x27;s workshops, also vacated the building at about the same time.

In 1984 construction work began on a £, replacement on Thompson Street and in 1985 the old London Road Fire Station was brought within the Whitworth Street Conservation Area. In 1986 the fire service left London Road for its new fire station, London Road Fire Station closed and the building was sold.
==Dereliction and redevelopment==
=== 1986 purchase and decline ===
After the sale in 1986, the building was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, with varying degrees of success. The coroner&#x27;s court was the last to vacate the premises, in 1998. In 2001, the building was placed on English Heritage&#x27;s Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum was building for the fire station&#x27;s owner, Britannia Hotels, to act.

=== 2006 plans ===
In February 2006, Argent proposed leasing the building from Britannia Hotels to transform it into a music and arts venue. Manchester City Council backed the plans and refused to rule out a compulsory purchase order (CPO) if the owner did not act to redevelop the building. Britannia Hotels branded Argent&#x27;s plans &quot;unworkable&quot; and proposed turning the building into a company headquarters, 200-bed hotel, and fire station museum. A planning application was promised by March 2006, but by May none had been made. Work was carried out by February 2007 to make the building watertight and in autumn 2007 a proposal was made by Britannia to convert the building into a hotel.

Britannia Hotels appointed Purcell Miller Tritton to draw up plans to convert the building into a hotel in 2008 but none were produced by May 2009 and the city council lost faith in Britannia Hotels&#x27; commitment to its redevelopment. The city council was concerned that the state of the fire station was limiting regeneration in the area, including a proposed government complex on the former Mayfield Railway Station site. The city council set a deadline of July 2009 for progress on redevelopment. Britannia Hotels&#x27; proposal in July 2009 was to convert the fire station into a hotel with a 15-storey tower in its courtyard and promised a planning application by October 2009, but none was made and the city council&#x27;s chief executive recommended issuing a CPO. 

=== 2010 CPO issued ===
A meeting of the city council in January 2010 approved a request for up to £5.25 million to cover the costs associated with the fire station&#x27;s acquisition. Britannia Hotels responded by pledging to make a new proposal by February 2010, rendering the CPO unnecessary. Britannia submitted an application to turn the fire station into a 227-bed 4-star hotel in June 2010. The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion. Manchester City Council decided to continue with the CPO. The city council issued a CPO on 5 August 2010. Despite the plans being approved on 16 September 2010, the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011. 

=== 2011 CPO rejected ===
Britannia&#x27;s objection to the CPO led to a public inquiry in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected. Despite Britannia&#x27;s guarantee at the inquiry to proceed with the development, it reconsidered its plans. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable for the foreseeable future. Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan. English Heritage and the city council expressed disappointment. The city council offered to buy the building at market value.

=== 2013 campaign for a second CPO ===
In February 2013 after a public meeting, the Friends of London Road Fire Station (FoLRFS) was formed to pressurise Britannia Hotels and persuade the council to attempt a second CPO. The group organised an online petition, fundraising events, public meetings, an online survey to discover locals&#x27; views, an art exhibition and public engagement with its history, and published the outcome of a Freedom of Information Act request on what the council had done regarding surveying the building and issuing urgent-works notices. In November 2013, Britannia applied to extend the 2010 planning permissions but despite objections the applications were approved on technical grounds in December 2013. 

=== 2014 second CPO started ===
The council considered applying for a CPO for the second time in September 2014 and confirmed its intention to do so in December 2014 and meet with FoLRFS in early 2015. FoLRFS received a grant from Locality&#x27;s Community Assets in Difficult Ownership (CADO) programme to pay for public outreach work. On 30 April 2015, FoLRFS met Pat Bartoli, head of the council&#x27;s urban regeneration team and Howard Bernstein who praised their campaign. 

=== 2015 owner sells the building ===
It was announced immediately after the meeting that Britannia Hotels had decided to sell the building. London Road Fire Station was put on the market on 1 May 2015 and expected offers of around £10 million while restoration is expected to cost £20–30 million. Allied London acquired the fire station on 16 November 2015.

<text>Brisbane Stadium (Lang Park), currently known as Suncorp Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a multi-purpose stadium in the suburb of Milton, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Nicknamed The Cauldron, it is a three-tiered rectangular sporting stadium with a capacity of 52,500. The traditional home of rugby league in Brisbane, the modern stadium is also now used for rugby union and soccer and has a rectangular playing field of . The stadium&#x27;s major tenants are the Brisbane Broncos, the Dolphins, the Brisbane Roar, the Queensland Maroons and the Queensland Reds.

Lang Park was established in 1914, on the site of the former North Brisbane Cemetery; in its early days it was home to a number of different sports, including cycling, athletics and soccer. The lease of the park was taken over by the Brisbane Rugby League in 1957, before it became the home of the game in Queensland (remaining so to this day). It has also been the home ground of major rugby union and soccer matches in Queensland since its modern redevelopment, including the Queensland Reds and the Brisbane Roar, as well as some Wallabies, Matildas and Socceroos matches. It hosted the 2008 and 2017 Rugby League World Cup finals, besides the 2021 NRL Grand Final. In addition to this, the ground hosted Rugby World Cup quarter finals and two Super Rugby grand finals, with the Queensland Reds winning on both occasions. The venue hosted several matches for the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup including the third-place match, and will host the rugby sevens and soccer tournaments at the 2032 Summer Olympics, including the gold medal matches in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer events.

==History==
===Origins===
The site of Lang Park was originally the North Brisbane Cemetery, and until 1875 was Brisbane&#x27;s primary cemetery. By 1911, the area was heavily populated, so the Paddington Cemeteries Act (1911) was introduced, and the site was redeveloped as a recreational site. In 1914, it was fenced off and named Lang Park after John Dunmore Lang.

The ground was leased by the Queensland Amateur Athletics Association (QAAA) in the 1920s. In 1935, the Queensland Soccer Council (QSC) became a sub-tenant of the QAAA, with a view to using it as the home ground for Brisbane soccer fixtures (leaving its former home, the Brisbane Cricket Ground). The Latrobe Soccer Club, in turn, became a sub-tenant of the QSC, using the ground for its home games (see image below).

However, by 1937, the QSC was considering sub-leasing Lang Park to &quot;another code of football&quot; (most likely Western Suburbs Rugby League) as it &quot;was not satisfied with the financial returns ... under the sub-lease to the Latrobe-Milton club&quot;. Latrobe in turn responded that &quot;&#x27;If no action Is taken to introduce the Ipswich clubs into the Brisbane competition this&#x27; season ... the Latrobe-Milton Club cannot accept an increase in rental for Lang Park. Give us competition play with Ipswich and my club will hold the ground as headquarters for the code.&quot;

On 11 February 1950, the official opening of the Lang Park Police Citizens Youth Club took place and youth activities commenced because of the concerns with the increase of juvenile delinquency. Activities such as boxing, wrestling, basketball and gymnastics all occur at these premises to this day. Contemporaneous records are scant, but it appears the QSC did not renew the lease the ground after the intervening World War II. In 1953 the Brisbane Rugby League (BRL) amalgamated with the Queensland Rugby League (QRL). QRL secretary Ron McAullife negotiated a 21-year lease of Lang Park from the Brisbane City Council in order to give the QRL a financially viable base of operations. The park had only the most basic facilities, and the QRL contributed £17,000 to its development. Lang Park hosted its first game of first grade rugby league during the 1930s, with regular BRL games commencing there in 1955. In 1958, it hosted its first Brisbane rugby league grand final in which Brothers defeated Valleys 22 points to 7. A record crowd of 19,824 saw Northern Suburbs defeat Fortitude Valley at Lang Park in the BRL grand final in September 1961.

In the 1960s, Fonda Metassa famously burst from the back of an ambulance to return to the field after being carted off injured in a match for Norths against Redcliffe. As the ground was used increasingly by the QRL, it became no longer viable for use as a public recreation facility due to spoilage of the running track. In 1962, the Lang Park Trust was created under an act of Parliament. This allowed for the construction of the Frank Burke Stand (1962), Ron McAuliffe Stand (1975), and the Western Grandstand (1994). The Trust had on its board one member from the Queensland Government, one member from the Brisbane City Council, two members from the Queensland Rugby League and one member from the Brisbane Rugby League.

From the 1960s, Lang Park hosted interstate and international rugby league, including the inaugural State of Origin match. Up until 1972, it was the home ground of the Western Suburbs Panthers.

===NSWRL/ARL years===
In 1988, the Brisbane Broncos entered the NSWRL Premiership along with the Gold Coast Chargers and the Newcastle Knights. The Broncos played out of Lang Park from 1988 until 1992, when they moved to the 60,000 capacity ANZ Stadium, the stadium for the 1982 Commonwealth Games. The move occurred due to a dispute over the Broncos sponsor, Power&#x27;s Brewery, being a competitor of the QRL&#x27;s sponsor XXXX.

In 1994, the stadium&#x27;s name was changed to Suncorp Stadium, when naming sponsorship was attained by Queensland financial institution, Suncorp. The venue is currently managed by AEG Ogden. On 25 May 1997, the 1996/1997 National Soccer League Grand final was played in front of then a capacity crowd of 40,446, where the Brisbane Strikers FC defeated Sydney United FC 2–0.

===Redevelopment===
Lang Park was heavily redeveloped in the early 2000s into a 52,500 all-seater state of the art rectangular stadium.

Lang Park suffered significant damage during the 2010–2011 Queensland floods with the entire playing field being covered by flood water. An electrical fire started in a transformer room due to water ingress, however there was no major damage from the fire.

===Today===
Although the stadium has been the traditional home of rugby league in Queensland, it has also become the state&#x27;s premier venue for soccer, as well as rugby union. The re-developed stadium first hosted rugby union games at the 2003 Rugby World Cup and in 2005, the stadium became the new home of the Queensland Reds Super Rugby team when they moved from their former home at Ballymore Stadium. This move caused some disquiet amongst rugby traditionalists, however was accepted by Queensland Rugby Union CEO Theo Psaros, who said that &quot;our hearts may be at Ballymore but our heads say it&#x27;s time to move.&quot;. The year before the Reds&#x27; move, the newly established football team Queensland Roar of the A-League also elected to play their home games at Suncorp Stadium.

New Zealand rugby journalist Wynne Gray called Suncorp Stadium perhaps the best rugby stadium in the world. &quot;It is so intimate you can hear the smack of bodies, the boot on leather, you feel the power and rhythm of the games.&quot;

The stadium has also been favourably compared to Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium and London&#x27;s Twickenham Stadium.

On 29 July 2006, the Bledisloe Cup clash between the Wallabies and the All Blacks returned to Brisbane for the first time in over a decade for the 2006 Tri Nations Series. Though Australia narrowly lost the match, the game saw a new ground record set.

A month later on 7 October the stadium hosted a 1–1 friendly soccer game between Australia and Paraguay in which Tony Vidmar, Stan Lazaridis, Zeljko Kalac and goal scorer Tony Popovic all retired from international soccer.

On 8 November 2006, a crowd of 44,358 saw the Great Britain national rugby league team play against Australia for the last time.

On Wednesday 13 and Thursday 14 December, the stadium hosted its first music concert since the 1980s and the stadium&#x27;s redevelopment when Robbie Williams performed in front of two 52,413 sell-out crowds during his &quot;Close Encounters&quot; tour of Australia, and was the venue for the U2 360 tour in December 2010. That same month the stadium hosted Bon Jovi as part of The Circle Tour.

The Stadium was also the site of the 2011 A-League Grand Final, drawing a crowd of over 50,000. The match was one of the most dramatic in A-League history, with the Brisbane Roar scoring two goals in the last five minutes to level the scores with the Central Coast Mariners after several hundred home supporters had left the stadium early, many returning after hearing the stadium erupt while waiting for the train. The Roar went on to win 4–2 in the penalty shootout, making for an incredible victory.

The stadium is also home to the Lang Park Police Citizens Youth Club.

American Singer-Songwriter Taylor Swift played at Suncorp Stadium for her Red Tour on 7 December 2013.

In September 2016, it was announced that the video screens, originally installed in 2003, would be replaced. Construction started on the new video screens in March 2017 and was finished in early May 2017 in time for an NRL double header.

In 2019, the stadium hosted the NRL&#x27;s inaugural Magic Round, in which all eight matches in a single round are played at the one venue.

In 2020, the Melbourne Storm played their &quot;home&quot; finals at the venue, as it was not possible for the team to play them at its regular home ground, AAMI Park, due to the state of Victoria being locked down during the state&#x27;s second wave of coronavirus infections.

On 26 June 2021, the Queensland Maroons played at home against the New South Wales Blues in the State of Origin series. Queensland lost the game 26–0, and henceforth the series.

Due to a COVID-19 lockdown in New South Wales, which began on 26 June 2021 and was still in effect into October, the stadium hosted twenty-one extra games on top of its normal commitments to the Brisbane Broncos as well as Magic Round, including the 2021 NRL Grand Final on 3 October 2021. This was the second time that a rugby league premiership Grand Final was played outside of Sydney, following the 1997 Super League Grand Final.

In 2023, the stadium hosted several matches of the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

On February 15, 2025, All Elite Wrestling will make its Australian debut with AEW Grand Slam Australia at the stadium.

==Popular culture==

In the 1980s, Brisbane rugby league icon Wally Lewis became known as &quot;The Emperor of Lang Park&quot; after his performances in State of Origin matches played at the ground. Brisbane-based beer XXXX, which is brewed at the nearby Castlemaine Brewery, ran a television advertisement celebrating this title in song:
In 2006, Queensland Minister for Sport, Tom Barton introduced the Stadium&#x27;s Sports Media Hall of Fame which honours the achievements of media representatives who have covered the major football codes played at this historic ground over the past 40 years. So far, there are five inductees: rugby league commentator George Lovejoy, rugby league journalists Jack Reardon and Steve Ricketts, Gerry Collins and Frank O&#x27;Callaghan.

===Statues===
There are several commemorative bronze statues outside the stadium:
* Wally Lewis (Rugby league) 
* Darren Lockyer (Rugby league) 
* Mal Meninga (Rugby league)
* Arthur Beetson (Rugby league)
* John Eales (Rugby union)
* Allan Langer (Rugby league)
* The Matildas 2023 World Cup team (Soccer)

== Awards ==
In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Suncorp Stadium (Lang Park) was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;structure and engineering feat&quot;.

==Concerts==
==Accessibility==
Controversially, the redevelopment was the first major sporting facility in Australia with no car parking, primarily due to concerns with traffic congestion in the surrounding residential neighbourhood. Instead, the stadium&#x27;s is surrounded by pubs, restaurants, cafes, bars and the XXXX brewery. This together with dedicated pedestrian links to Milton railway station and Brisbane CBD adds to the match day experience and is seen as a model for new stadiums and large entertainment venues. The stadium redevelopment has been the catalyst for the Barracks urban renewal development at Petrie Terrace midway along the dedicated pedestrian link to the CBD.

==Controversies==
On Thursday, 16 June 2011, The Weekend Australian revealed that Suncorp Stadium was in danger of either losing the hosting rights to all Queensland based NRL finals matches to Sydney, or having its capacity limited to 25,000 seats, due to a condition included in the legislation regarding the Stadium&#x27;s redevelopment that only 24 &#x27;special events&#x27; (i.e. with attendance in excess of 25,000) a year can be hosted at the venue. This number of special events was reached when the Brisbane Broncos faced the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in Round 26 of the 2011 NRL Telstra Premiership Season. On 6 September 2011, legislation was passed to lift the crowd capacity limit to 35,000 for those 24 events, enabling the Broncos to host finals matches should they progress that far.

The stadium&#x27;s grass quality was criticised by coaches and players during the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

==Rugby league test matches==
The venue has hosted forty-two Australia internationals. The results were as follows;
It also hosted three non Australia matches. Incidentally, they were all England matches. The first was a 1975 Rugby League World Cup match against Wales on 10 June 1975 with 6,000 in attendance and lost 12 – 7. The second was a 2008 Rugby League World Cup match against New Zealand on 15 November 2008 with 26,659 in attendance and lost 32 – 22. The third and final to date was a 2014 Four Nations match between against Samoa with 47,813 in attendance and was a double header which was followed by the Australia New Zealand match. England won 32 – 26.

Suncorp Stadium hosted two matches of the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. The venue played host to the first semi-final on 24 November and the tournament final on 2 December.

==Rugby union internationals==
==Men&#x27;s soccer internationals==
== Women&#x27;s soccer internationals ==
==Boxing==
Suncorp Stadium was the host of the Manny Pacquiao vs. Jeff Horn fight for the WBO welterweight championship with 51,052 people in attendance.

<doc id="1214326" wikidata="Q2034345" url="?curid=1214326" title="Seal of Michigan">
<text>The Great Seal of the State of Michigan depicts the coat of arms of the U.S. state of Michigan on a light blue field. On the dark blue shield the Sun rises over a lake and peninsula, a man holding a long gun with a raised hand represents peace and the ability to defend his rights. The elk and moose are symbols of Michigan, while the bald eagle represents the United States.

The design features three Latin mottos. From top to bottom they are:
#On the red ribbon: , &quot;Out of many, one&quot;, a motto of the United States
#On the blue shield: , &quot;I will defend&quot;
#On the white ribbon: , &quot;If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you&quot;, which is the official state motto. It was adopted in 1835 and is said to have been suggested by the tribute to architect Christopher Wren at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, which reads (Latin &quot;If you seek [his] monument, look around you&quot;).

This seal was adopted in the year of 1835, on June 22.

Public Act 19 of 1963 states that &quot;The great seal shall be the coat of arms of the state around which shall appear the words &#x27;great seal of the state of Michigan, A.D. MDCCCXXXV&#x27;.&quot;

==Coat of arms of Michigan==
Legally distinct from, but adopted simultaneously alongside the Great Seal in 1835, is the coat of arms of Michigan. The current rendition of the coat of arms was adopted by the Legislature in 1911 (MCL 2.21). It is identical to the Great Seal of Michigan with the legend or circle, &quot;The Great Seal of the State of Michigan, A.D. MDCCCXXXV&quot;, omitted. Unlike the Great Seal, the coat of arms may be printed on documents, stationery, or ornaments with no design or words and disconnected with any advertisement (MCL 750.247). However, a person who improperly exhibits and displays the coat of arms is guilty of a misdemeanor (MCL 750.245).

<doc id="1214335" wikidata="Q967251" url="?curid=1214335" title="HMS Yarmouth (F101)">
<text>HMS &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was the first modified Type 12 frigate of the &quot;Rothesay&quot; class to enter service with the Royal Navy.

She was rammed in the Third Cod War by the Icelandic gunboat &quot;Baldur&quot; and had to limp away from the patrol area for repairs.

During the Falklands War, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; took part in the only encounter between armed ships of the war, when she and HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; shelled the Argentine coaster ARA &quot;Monsunen&quot;. In the last action of the conflict, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; and HMS &quot;Endurance&quot; recaptured the South Sandwich Islands.

==Design==
The &quot;Rothesay&quot;-class was an improved version of the &quot;Whitby&quot;-class anti-submarine frigate, with nine &quot;Rothesay&quot;s ordered in the 1954–55 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy to supplement the six &quot;Whitby&quot;s.

&quot;Yarmouth&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The &quot;Rothesay&quot;s were powered by the same Y-100 machinery used by the &quot;Whitby&quot;-class. Two Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers fed steam at and to two sets of geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts, fitted with large ( diameter) slow-turning propellers. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Crew was about 212 officers and men.

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward, with 350 rounds of ammunition carried. It was originally intended to fit a twin 40 mm L/70 Bofors anti-aircraft mount aft, but in 1957 it was decided to fit the Seacat anti-aircraft missile instead. Seacat was not yet ready, and &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was completed with a single L/60 40 mm Bofors mount aft as a temporary anti-aircraft armament. The design anti-submarine armament consisted of twelve 21-inch torpedo-tubes (eight fixed and two twin rotating mounts) for Mark 20E Bidder homing anti-submarine torpedoes, backed up by two Limbo anti-submarine mortars fitted aft. The Bidder homing torpedoes proved unsuccessful however, being too slow to catch modern submarines, and the torpedo tubes were soon removed.

The ship was fitted with a Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast, with a Type 277 height-finding radar on a short mast forward of the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship&#x27;s bridge, while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. The ship&#x27;s sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Limbo and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor.

&quot;Yarmouth&quot; was laid down at John Brown&#x27;s Clydebank dockyard on 29 November 1957, was launched on 23 March 1959 and completed on 26 March 1960.

===Modernisation===
From 1966 to 1968 &quot;Yarmouth&quot; underwent a major modernisation, which brought the ship close in capacity to the &quot;Leander&quot;-class. A hangar and flight deck was added aft to allow a Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, at the expense of one of the Limbo anti-submarine mortars, while a Seacat launcher and the associated GWS20 director was mounted on the hangar roof. Two 20-mm cannons were added either side of the ship&#x27;s bridge. A MRS3 fire control system replaced the Mark 6M, and its integral Type 903 radar allowed the Type 277 height finder radar to be removed. A Type 993 surface/air-search radar replaced the existing Type 293Q radar, while the ship&#x27;s defences were enhanced by the addition of the Corvus chaff rocket dispenser.

==Operational history==
&quot;Yarmouth&quot; commissioned on 24 March 1960, with the Pennant number F101, and joined the 6th Frigate Squadron of the Home Fleet as leader. She was refitted at Devonport from December 1961 to February 1962, then became the leader of the 20th Frigate Squadron at Londonderry, serving in that role until 1966.

On 13 July 1965 she collided with the submarine &quot;Tiptoe&quot;, 10 miles south east of Portland Bill. &quot;Tiptoe&quot; survived, and was able to make Gosport under her own power, and was repaired at the yards of Cammell Laird. &quot;Tiptoe&quot;″s commanding officer was found guilty of negligence for the accident. In May 1966 she began a long refit and modernisation at Portsmouth Dockyard. The main alterations were to build a hangar and flight deck for a Wasp Helicopter and to fit Seacat anti-aircraft missiles. She recommissioned on 1 October 1968 for service in the Western Fleet and then in the Far East Fleet. In 1971 she was present at Portsmouth Navy Days.

In April 1970 whilst on the Beira Patrol she was diverted to be a long stop for the rescue of Apollo 13. Communications in the Indian Ocean were very poor. The recovery instructions were sent from Houston to Halifax, Nova Scotia where the Royal Canadian Navy sent them by Morse Code to the ship. The recovery manual was taken down by communications ratings, two at a time, with pencil and paper. Luckily the space craft came down amongst a US Navy task force with two aircraft carriers and television cameras in the Pacific Ocean.

On 9 November 1970 the aircraft carrier collided with the Soviet Kotlin-class destroyer, &quot;Bravyy&quot;, which had been shadowing the carrier during exercises in the Mediterranean and cut across the bows of &quot;Ark Royal&quot; while the carrier was launching aircraft. Several of &quot;Bravyy&quot;″s crew were washed overboard in the incident with &quot;Yarmouth&quot; rescuing two of them, although two of the seven Soviet sailors were lost in the accident. A few days later, the tanker &quot;Esso Chile&quot; suffered an explosion off Malta which had killed one and injured two of the tanker&#x27;s crew. &quot;Yarmouth&quot;″s helicopter flew a doctor over to &quot;Esso Chile&quot; and ferried the wounded to shore for further medical treatment.

===Third Cod War===
On 28 February 1976, in the course of the Third Cod War, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; collided with &quot;ICGV Baldur&#x27;s&quot; stern, severely damaging the frigate&#x27;s bow, and forcing her to limp away from the patrol area assisted by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service tug &quot;Rollicker&quot;. &quot;Yarmouth&quot; underwent repairs at Chatham, where she was fitted with a new bow section. The heavy damage and pressure on the defense budget saw HMS &quot;Yarmouth&quot; offered to the RNZN later in 1976, but the offer was rejected on account of the frigate&#x27;s age.

===Falklands War===
She arrived off the Falklands in late April 1982 and began protective escort for the Task Force. On 4 May, when was hit by an Exocet missile, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; provided anti-submarine protection as attempted to fight the fire. After &quot;Sheffield&quot; had been abandoned, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; took her in tow in order to get her to a safe area. However, after 29 hours the winds rose to gale force and &quot;Sheffield&quot; finally sank on 10 May at 7 am.

When the amphibious task force arrived on 19 May, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; provided an anti-air and anti-submarine escort as the force moved into San Carlos Water as part of Operation Sutton. On 21 May when was hit and set on fire by Argentine Skyhawks, Yarmouth rescued the crew of the stricken ship and later transferred them to the SS &quot;Canberra&quot;. For the next ten days she continued to act in an air defence role during the battle of San Carlos by day, but by night operated a variety of missions including shore bombardment, anti-submarine patrols, covert operations and escorting merchant ships to and from the landing area.

In the early hours of 23 May &quot;Yarmouth&quot; and intercepted the Argentine coaster ARA &quot;Monsunen&quot;. &quot;Yarmouth&quot; engaged the coaster with her 4.5&quot; guns west of Lively Island; the Argentine vessel evaded capture by running aground at Seal Cove.

On 25 May &quot;Yarmouth&quot; claimed to have shot down an A-4C Skyhawk (C-319), flown by Teniente Tomás Lucero, with her Sea Cat missile system, although this aircraft was subjected to the full force of the San Carlos&#x27; air defences, with other claims from Rapier, Blowpipe and ship-based gunfire. Lucero ejected and was recovered by .

After two days of maintenance in the repair area, she returned to bombardment duties beginning on 6 June. These she carried out by night while by day she travelled some 200 miles back to the task force to replenish fuel and ammunition. During one of these missions, she came across a small coaster whose propeller had become fouled with rope while ferrying Gurkhas and supplies to Goose Green. Her diving team managed to free the ship. On another occasion she gave firefighting and medical assistance to when the destroyer was hit by a land-based Exocet. On 13–14 June, she and shelled Argentine positions during the Battle of Mount Tumbledown. During the war, she fired over 1,000 shells from her main guns, mostly during shore bombardment, and 58 anti-submarine Limbo mortar rounds.

After the Argentine surrender of the Falkland Islands, &quot;Yarmouth&quot;, HMS &quot;Endurance&quot;, RFA &quot;Olmeda&quot; and the tug &quot;Salvageman&quot; sailed to the South Sandwich Islands where Argentina had established a base in South Thule since 1976. Following a demonstration of the &quot;Yarmouth&quot;&#x27;s guns, the ten Argentine military personnel surrendered.

Before leaving South Thule, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was refuelled by the RFA &quot;Olmeda&quot; on 21 June, which may have been the most southerly RAS(L) in the history of the Royal Navy.

==Decommissioning==

She was decommissioned on 30 April 1986, and in 1987 towed out to the North Atlantic and sunk by weapons from in that year&#x27;s SinkEx on 16 June 1987.

<doc id="1214340" wikidata="Q1351401" url="?curid=1214340" title="René Schneider">
<text>René Schneider Chereau (; December 31, 1913 – October 25, 1970) was a Chilean military official who served as commander-in-chief of the Chilean Army at the time of the 1970 Chilean presidential election, when he was assassinated during a botched kidnapping attempt. He coined the doctrine of military-political mutual exclusivity that became known as the Schneider Doctrine.

==Background==
He was born in Concepción, Chile, as a descendant of ethnic German and French immigrants, and joined the army in 1929. After a brilliant career, he was named Commander-in-Chief on October 27, 1969, by President Eduardo Frei Montalva, as a result of the Tacna agreement.

Schneider had expressed firm opposition to the idea of preventing Salvador Allende&#x27;s inauguration by means of a coup d&#x27;état; as a constitutionalist, he wished to continue the Chilean military&#x27;s long apolitical history.

==Assassination==
After the 1970 Chilean presidential election, a plot to kidnap Schneider was developed. &quot;Neutralizing&quot; Schneider became a key prerequisite for a military coup; he opposed any intervention by the armed forces to block Allende&#x27;s constitutional election. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who considered Schneider &quot;a major stumbling block for military officers seeking to carry out a coup,&quot; supplied a group of Chilean officers led by General Camilo Valenzuela with &quot;sterile&quot; weapons for the operation which was to be blamed on Allende supporters.

===First and second attempts===
On October 16, 1970, based on an anonymous tip on Schneider&#x27;s whereabouts, the first group attempted to kidnap him from his home. The tip turned out to be false as he had been on vacation since two days earlier and didn&#x27;t return until the next day.

On the evening of October 19, 1970, a second group of coup-plotters loyal to General Roberto Viaux, equipped with tear gas grenades attempted to grab Schneider as he left an official dinner. The attempt failed because he left in a private car and not the expected official vehicle. The failure produced an extremely significant cable from CIA headquarters in Washington to the local station, asking for urgent action because &quot;Headquarters must respond during morning 20 October to queries from high levels.&quot; Payments of $50,000 each to Viaux and his chief associate were then authorised on the condition that they made another attempt.

===Final attempt===
On October 22, 1970, the coup-plotters again attempted to kidnap Schneider. His official car was ambushed at a street intersection in the capital city of Santiago. Schneider drew a gun to defend himself, and was shot point-blank several times. According to a report by the Chilean military police, &quot;five individuals, one of who, making use of a blunt instrument similar to a sledgehammer, broke the rear window and then fired at General Schneider, striking him in the region of the spleen, in the left shoulder, and in the left wrist.&quot; He was rushed to a military hospital, but the wounds proved fatal and he died three days later, on October 25.

The attempt to kidnap him was because Schneider was the army Commander-in-Chief and considered a constitutionalist, which in practical terms meant that he would not support a coup. This incident and his death provoked national outrage, and caused the citizens and the military to rally behind the just-elected Allende, who was ratified by the Chilean Congress on October 24. It also helped to ensure an orderly transfer of power to Allende.

Military courts in Chile found that Schneider&#x27;s death was caused by two military groups, one led by Viaux and the other by General Camilo Valenzuela. Viaux and Valenzuela were eventually convicted of charges of conspiring to cause a coup, and Viaux also was convicted of kidnapping. The lawsuit asserted that the CIA had aided both groups, but the charges were deemed not-satisfactorily-proven (despite evidence of the CIA sponsoring the kidnap-turned-murder with tens of thousands of dollars and submachine guns). Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive&#x27;s Chile Documentation Project, asserts that CIA documents show &quot;Viaux was not acting independently or unilaterally, but clearly as a co-conspirator with Valenzuela...&quot;

On October 26, 1970, President Eduardo Frei Montalva named General Carlos Prats as Commander-in-Chief to replace Schneider. This happened at the same time that $35,000 was given by the CIA to the kidnappers &quot;to keep the prior contact secret, maintain the goodwill of the group, and for humanitarian reasons.&quot;

==Lawsuits==
On September 10, 2001 Schneider&#x27;s family filed a suit against Henry Kissinger, accusing him of collaborating with Viaux in arranging for Schneider&#x27;s murder. While declassified documents show the CIA, displeased with the socialist victory, had explored the idea of supporting Viaux in a coup attempt, they also show that the agency decided on tracking down other members of the Chilean military, deciding that a Viaux coup would fail. Nevertheless, Viaux, acting on the advice of the CIA, teamed up with other coup plotters. CIA documents show unwavering support for Viaux&#x27;s co-conspirator, Camilo Valenzuela, and also show a $50,000 payment to the kidnap team Viaux had hired. Documents written at the time of the assault on Schneider describe it as part of the &quot;Valenzuela group coup plan.&quot; On October 15, 1970 Kissinger allegedly told U.S. President Richard Nixon that he had &quot;turned off&quot; plans to support Viaux, explaining that &quot;Nothing could be worse than an abortive coup.&quot; The CIA claimed that no such &quot;stand-down&quot; order was ever received.

The U.S. government claims it did not intend for Schneider to be murdered, only kidnapped. When Alexander Haig, Kissinger&#x27;s aide, was asked &quot;is kidnapping not a crime?&quot; he replied &quot;that depends.&quot; Such an argument would carry no weight in any court of law. Christopher Hitchens noted that Chilean authorities treated the crime as a straightforward murder. He argued that, &quot;under the law of every law-bound country (including the United States), a crime committed in the pursuit of a kidnapping is thereby aggravated, not mitigated. You may not say, with a corpse at your feet, &#x27;I was only trying to kidnap him.&#x27;&quot;

The lawsuit against Kissinger was eventually dismissed in the federal district court; the dismissal was subsequently upheld by the D.C. Court of Appeals. A petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied.

<doc id="1214344" wikidata="Q1816122" url="?curid=1214344" title="Little Barrier Island">
<text>Little Barrier Island, or Hauturu in Māori (the official Māori title is Te Hauturu-o-Toi), lies off the northeastern coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. Located to the north of Auckland, the island is separated from the mainland to the west by the Jellicoe Channel, and from the larger Great Barrier Island to the east by the Cradock Channel. The two aptly named islands shelter the Hauraki Gulf from many of the storms of the Pacific Ocean.
Settled by the Māori between 1350 and 1650, the island was occupied by them until the New Zealand government declared the island a wildlife sanctuary in 1897. Since the island came under control of the government, it has been under limited access, with only a few rangers living on the island. In the Māori language, the name of the island name means &quot;the resting place of lingering breezes&quot;. Along with its larger neighbour Great Barrier, it was given its English name by Captain James Cook in 1769.

The island is a nature sanctuary which has been described by the MBIE as &quot;the most intact [native] ecosystem in New Zealand&quot;. However, several invasive species were introduced by both Maori and European settlers, including cats, which were destructive to local small bird and reptile species until they were eradicated between July 1977 and June 1980 in what was possibly New Zealand&#x27;s costliest pest control programme. This was followed by a rat eradication programme from 2004. A cost benefit analysis has been published.

== History ==
Māori occupied the island for centuries prior to the first European visits, probably first settling there between 1350 and 1650 CE. The initial occupation was by descendants of Toi te Huatahi, followed by Tainui, who were then conquered by Ngāti Wai. By 1881 only a few Ngāti Wai were still living there and the British Crown attempted to buy the island in order to turn it into a nature reserve. After the purchase fell through, the island was instead appropriated through an Act of Parliament in 1894 and became New Zealand&#x27;s first nature reserve the following year. Maori such as Rahui Te Kiri were evicted from the island by force in 1896. Since 1897, there has always been a caretaker or ranger resident on the island. In 2011 the crown settled treaty claims with local iwi, Hauturu was returned to iwi who in turn gifted it back to the people of Aotearoa.

Access is heavily restricted for conservation reasons, and the island is uninhabited except for rotational conservation staff, scientists and rangers under the authority of the Department of Conservation. Electricity for their needs was provided by a diesel generator linked to a battery bank until 2005, and has since been replaced by twenty 175-watt solar panels, with the generator remaining solely for backup. Over the expected 20-year life-span, the new system is expected to generate fuel savings sufficient to replace its purchase costs.

===Stonework===
Māori stonework has been found in fourteen locations on the island, primarily around the coastal flats at Te Titoki Point. Man-made cuttings, which were described in 1895 as ruts for hauling canoes, can be seen on the boulder beach ridge at Te Titoki Point. There are also stone rows measuring up to long, wide and high, located near the mouth of Te Waikohare Stream.

Stone rows and heaps can be found to from the mouths of Te Waikohare and Tirikawa Streams. The largest is high and wide. The most extensive stonework is located in the northwest of the island, near the ridge south of Te Hue Stream, where it is spread over several hectares. This site includes a number of terraces, which are stone-faced or have stone retaining walls. There are also numerous stone heaps and rows, and several free standing stone walls.

Stonework in the northeast of the island is more weathered than in other areas and partially buried. Because of this weathering these features are thought to be older than at the other sites.

== Geography ==
The island is an extinct andesitic stratovolcano, roughly circular in shape, about across, with an area of . Its earliest volcanic activity is estimated to have occurred 3 million years ago and the latest 1.2 million years ago. The volcano is most closely related to two volcanoes over northwest, near Whangārei. The volcanic activity on the island is associated with the Coromandel Volcanic Zone, which later moved southwards to form the modern Taupō Volcanic Zone. The island was one of the final volcanic events in the zone, as most volcanism in the zone occurred between 18 and 4 million years ago.

The island is steeply sloping, and deeply dissected by ravines radiating from a central range that peaks at Mount Hauturu whose altitude is . Te Titoki Point is the only area of flat land on the island.

Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, Little Barrier Island was landlocked to the North Island, surrounded by a vast coastal plain where the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana exists today. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which Little Barrier became an island separated from the rest of New Zealand. During the glacial period, a river formed by the Mahurangi River and Waitematā Harbour river flowed between Little Barrier Island and Great Barrier Island.

==Environment==
A dense forest cover shelters numerous rare or endangered animal species. The total number of species of native plants is thought to range around 400, and the island may shelter more endangered birds than any other island in New Zealand. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a nesting site for vulnerable Cook&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s petrels. In February 2013, there were reports of the critically endangered New Zealand storm petrel (&quot;Oceanites maorianus&quot;) breeding on the island. 
When Māori occupied the island, as much as a third of the island was cleared of forest. However, since the acquisition of the land by the New Zealand government, all but 20 hectares of the island have been reforested.

Bryde&#x27;s whales, orcas and bottlenose dolphins live in the waters around the island. Blue whales and southern right whales rest in this area during migration. In 2012, there were reports that a southern right whale may have calved near the island.

The island was, until recently, the last refuge for two species: the Stitchbird and the wētāpunga. By 1883, the Stitchbird was confined to Little Barrier Island due to introduced species and deforestation on the mainland. Thanks to the actions of Department of Conservation, the species has been reintroduced to several other offshore islands as well as some mainland sanctuaries that have predator-proof fences, such as the Bushy Park forest reserve. The wētāpunga, on the other hand, has been confined to this island since its extinction in the Northland and Auckland regions sometime in the 19th century. The last population continued to decline until the removal of kiore in 2004. Since then, the population has made a rapid recovery, and the species has been reintroduced to numerous predator-free places and islands as well.

There are several invertebrate species that are only known from this island, namely the ground beetle &quot;Mecodema haunoho&quot; and the spiders &quot;Migas insularis&quot; and &quot;Stanwellia hapua&quot;.

=== Kākāpō ===
Kākāpō (night parrots), also critically endangered, were first translocated to Little Barrier Island/Hauturu in 1982. Kākāpō successfully bred on the island in the 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s with the support of supplementary food. All birds were later removed in 1999, so that kiore (Polynesian rats) could be eradicated from the island using poison bait.

Kākāpō were then (re)introduced to the island in 2012; as of July 2017, their population on the island stood at 14.

Hauturu is a testing site to see if the kākāpō can breed and raise their young successfully without human intervention. As Hauturu is a large predator free island, there is great potential for the kākāpō in the long term.

===Invasive species===
====Mammals====
The Polynesian rat or kiore (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) were likely introduced as invasive species during the initial settlement of the island by Māori. Rat eradication took place by aerial-dropped poison baits in 2004.

Feral cats arrived on the island in the early 1870s. As in other places where predatory species were introduced, small animals not accustomed to predation likely experienced a decline in population, being pushed towards endangerment or extinction. In a survey of studies about eradicating the cats, scientist C.R. (&quot;Dick&quot;) Veitch mentions several small species which were likely affected by the cats, including small reptiles and birds, such as the North Island snipe (&quot;Coenocorypha barrierensis&quot;), which only survived into the European era on this island and was formerly distributed across the entirety of the North Island, North Island saddleback (&quot;Philesturnus rufusater&quot;), grey-faced petrel (&quot;Pterodroma macroptera gouldi&quot;), Cook&#x27;s petrel (&quot;Pterodroma cookii&quot;) and black petrel (&quot;Proeellaria parkinsoni&quot;). Cat eradication was completed by a dedicated team from July 1977 to 23 June 1980, and 151 cats were killed using traps and poison.

====Insects====
Introduced wasps such as (German, Common, Asian Paper, and Tasmanian paper wasps) may be present on the island. In terms of established populations of introduced wasps a survey reported in 2020 no &quot;Vespula&quot; species (Common and German wasps) but &quot;Polistes&quot; species (Asian Paper and Tasmanian wasps) were present. German wasps had been reported on the island by the 1980s. A potential relationship between rat eradication and decline in &quot;Vespula&quot; species has been reported, but no such link was found in later work.

====Plants====
Prior to 1995, very little attention was paid to weed species on the island. The rangers&#x27; garden had been planted in exotics, and bird and wind dispersed colonising species that spread rapidly. In 1996 a weed control programme, based on the successful work on the Kermadecs, was implemented with teams of weeders grid-searching the island. The main target species were climbing asparagus, the Mexican devil, and the mist flower.

<doc id="1214354" wikidata="Q6837430" url="?curid=1214354" title="Michigan, My Michigan">
<text>&quot;Michigan, My Michigan&quot; is a popular anthem in the State of Michigan. The actual state song, &quot;My Michigan&quot;, was formally adopted in 1937 but remains relatively obscure, partially because of the misconception that the official song is &quot;Michigan, My Michigan&quot;. A 2003 bill to make the song an official state song failed to pass.

==History==
Winifred Lee Brent Lyster of Detroit wrote the original 1862 lyrics of &quot;Michigan, My Michigan&quot; to the tune of &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; (known in English as &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot;), and which was also the melody of &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;, a former state song of the state of Maryland. Her husband, Henry, was a physician who rose to be Medical Inspector and Acting Medical Director of III Corps in the Union Army. He served from the First Battle of Bull Run to the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Mrs. Lyster was inspired to write the song after the Battle of Fredericksburg.

Major James W. Long of Grand Rapids wrote new lyrics in 1886 but kept the original tune and original Civil War sentiment. In 1902, Douglas Malloch wrote the current lyrics for a convention of the Michigan State Federation of Woman&#x27;s Clubs in Muskegon. He deemed them more suitable for a peacetime anthem. A new tune was also composed for the song by composer W. Otto Miessner of Detroit.


==1862 lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;Home of my heart, I sing of thee!
Michigan, My Michigan,
Thy lake-bound shores I long to see,
Michigan, my Michigan.
From Saginaw’s tall whispering pines
To Lake Superior’s farthest mines,
Fair in the light of memory shines
Michigan, my Michigan.
Thou gav’st thy sons without a sigh,
Michigan, my Michigan,
And sent thy bravest forth to die,
Michigan, my Michigan.
Beneath a hostile southern sky
They bore thy banner proud and high,
Ready to fight but never fly,
Michigan, my Michigan.
From Yorktown on to Richmond’s wall,
Michigan, my Michigan,
They bravely fight, as bravely fall,
Michigan, my Michigan.
To Williamsburgh we point with pride—
Our Fifth and Second, side by side,
There stemmed and stayed the battle’s tide,
Michigan, my Michigan.
When worn with watching traitor foes,
Michigan, my Michigan,
The welcome night brought sweet repose,
Michigan, my Michigan.
The soldier, weary from the fight,
Sleeps sound, nor fears the rebels’ might,
For &quot;Michigan’s on guard tonight!&quot;
Michigan, my Michigan.
Afar on Shiloh’s fatal plain,
Michigan, my Michigan,
Again behold thy heroes slain,
Michigan, my Michigan.
&quot;Their strong arms crumble in the dust,
And their bright swords have gathered rust;
Their memory is our sacred trust,&quot;
Michigan, my Michigan.
And often in the coming years,
Michigan, my Michigan,
Some widowed mother ‘ll dry her tears,
Michigan, my Michigan,
And turning with a thrill of pride,
Say to the children at her side,
At Antietam your father died,
For Michigan, our Michigan.
With General Grant’s victorious name,
Michigan, my Michigan,
Thy sons still onward march to fame,
Michigan, my Michigan.
And foremost in the fight we see,
Where e’er the bravest dare to be,
The sabres of thy cavalry,
Michigan, my Michigan.
Dark rolled the Rappahannock’s flood,
Michigan, my Michigan,
The tide was crimsoned with thy blood,
Michigan, my Michigan.
Although for us the clay was lost,
Still it shall be our broadest boast:
At Fredericksburg our Seventh crossed!
Michigan, my Michigan.
And when the happy time shall come,
Michigan, my Michigan,
That brings thy war-worn heroes home,
Michigan, my Michigan,
What welcome from their own proud shore,
What honors at their feet we’ll pour,
What tears for those who’ll come no more,
Michigan, my Michigan.
A grateful country claims them now,
Michigan, my Michigan,
And deathless laurel binds each brow,
Michigan, my Michigan;
And history the tale will tell,
Of how they fought and how they fell,
For that dear land they loved so well,
Michigan, my Michigan.&lt;/poem&gt;

== 1886 lyrics ==
&lt;poem&gt;Land of my love, I sing of thee,
Michigan, my Michigan;
With lake-bound shore, I&#x27;m proud of thee,
Michigan, my Michigan.
The sweet winds whisper through thy pines,
The jewels glitter in thy mines,
And glory on thy chaplet shines—
Michigan, my Michigan.

I&#x27;ve traveled all thy confines o&#x27;er,
Michigan, my Michigan;
From lake to lake, and shore to shore,
Michigan, my Michigan.
I&#x27;ve seen thy maimed, thy halt, thy blind,
I’ve seen the ones bereft of mind,
To all of them thou art so kind—
Michigan, my Michigan.

Thou art so pure, but modest, too,
Michigan, my Michigan;
Thou art so brave and still so true,
Michigan, my Michigan.
No promise unfulfilled;—on trust
Thy noble sons have bit the dust,
Remembered are they. For thou art just—
Michigan, my Michigan.

The axe resounds &#x27;mid woodland trees,
Michigan, my Michigan;
The sails of commerce court thy breeze,
Michigan, my Michigan.
And templed cities rise in sight,
And happy eyes catch heaven&#x27;s light,
Our God protects thee through the night,
Michigan, my Michigan.

Oh! Alma Mater, at thy shrine,
Michigan, my Michigan;
I worship thee as most divine,
Michigan, my Michigan,
&quot;Tuebor&quot; &quot;I’ll protect,&quot; &#x27;tis true—
Oh, fair peninsula! and you—
Shine out a gem in starry blue,
Michigan, my Michigan,

Thy diadem—thy hero sons,
Michigan, my Michigan;
Thy choicest love—their helpless ones,
Michigan, my Michigan.
And just as long as song shall ring
From those who bring an offering,
To thee, my love, this song shall sing—
Michigan, my Michigan.&lt;/poem&gt;
== 1902 lyrics ==
&lt;poem&gt;A song to you, fair State of mine,
Michigan, my Michigan.
But greater song than this is thine,
Michigan, my Michigan.
The whisper of the forest tree,
The thunder of the inland sea,
Unite in one grand symphony
Of Michigan, my Michigan.

I sing a State of all the best—
Michigan, my Michigan.
I sing a State with riches blessed—
Michigan, my Michigan.
Thy mines unmask a hidden store,
But richer thy historic lore,
More great the love thy builders bore,
Oh, Michigan, my Michigan.

How fair the bosom of thy lakes,
Michigan, my Michigan.
What melody each river makes,
Michigan, my Michigan.
As to thy lakes, the rivers tend,
Thine exiled children to thee send
Devotion that shall never end,
Oh, Michigan, my Michigan.

Rich in the wealth that makes a State,
Michigan, my Michigan.
Great in the things that make men great,
Michigan, my Michigan.
Our loyal voices sound thy claim
Upon the golden roll of fame;
Our loyal hands shall write the name
Oh Michigan, my Michigan,Michigan,Michigan
,Michigan,Michigan.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Rangitoto Channel is an area of the Hauraki Gulf in the Auckland Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The channel is north-east of the Waitematā Harbour, and is located between the North Shore and Rangitoto Island. The channel&#x27;s traditional Ngāi Tai name is , and is an important deep water shipping channel to reach the Ports of Auckland.

==Geography==

The Rangitoto Channel is located in Auckland, between the North Shore and Rangitoto Island. During the Last Glacial Maximum (known locally as the Ōtira Glaciation), the area was a valley for the Waitematā River, which when sea levels rose between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago became the Waitematā Harbour. The channel is an important stretch of water as it is the only deep water approach to Auckland Port for large ships such as container cargo ships and passenger cruise liners.

== History ==

The traditional Ngāi Tai name for the Rangitoto Channel is or &quot;The Great Channel of Peretū&quot;, named after an early ancestor in Tāmaki Makaurau, who lived at Narrow Neck and kept a kākā parrot reserve on Rangitoto Island. The channel was visited by the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe after arriving in Tāmaki Makaurau.

During the Russian scare of the 1880s, coastal fortifications were built along the Rangitoto Channel, including a fort at North Head and a military camp, Fort Cautley, at Narrow Neck. These were upgraded during World War II, and further gun emplacements were constructed at Castor Bay and other East Coast Bays areas to the north.

The channel was last dredged from a depth of 11.2m to 12.5m in a two-stage process in 2004. The first stage involved the mechanical excavation of hard rock. Blasting was not required. This was followed by the removal of softer material. All dredged material was used in the reclamation at Fergusson wharf.

<doc id="1214363" wikidata="Q7728623" url="?curid=1214363" title="The Daily Buzz">
<text>The Daily Buzz (occasionally abbreviated &quot;theDBZ&quot;) is a nationally syndicated news and infotainment program. The show premiered as a 3-hour weekday morning television show on September 16, 2002, initially airing on 10 stations owned and operated by the show&#x27;s founding owner, ACME Communications. By the time of its April 17, 2015 cancellation (the result of show owner Mojo Brands Media declaring bankruptcy), the show was distributed to stations in 149 U.S. television markets. Two years after leaving the air, &quot;Buzz&quot; would be revived as a weekly series in June 2017, after KEF Media acquired the show&#x27;s trademark. Despite the fact the revival now broadcasts weekly, the show retains the &quot;Daily Buzz&quot; name.

From its launch, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; has generally catered to a younger-skewing audience demographic, historically employing an informal atmosphere and a drive-time radio-style approach to presenting and discussing subjects in the realms of current events, lifestyle, entertainment, gossip, and pop culture, as well as celebrity interviews and paid publicity content. The approach set &quot;theDBZ&quot; apart, during its weekday run, from the traditional tone of network news programs, and would serve as an unofficial template for future national, syndicated, and local morning news shows.

In its weekday run, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; initially aired live for three hours, (6:00–9:00 a.m. ET), eventually shortening to a two-hour time slot (5:00–7:00 a.m. ET) for its last years as a weekday program. Start and running times varied by market, with some stations airing the show as a whole or only one or two hours. For most of its time on air, The CW Plus and its predecessor, The WB 100+ Station Group, carried the show in most smaller markets. &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; was also featured on the schedules of the Youtoo TV and Soul of the South networks; streamed live-to-air on the program&#x27;s website, and uploaded daily to Hulu. When it was revived as a weekly series, &quot;Buzz&quot; was re-added to the Youtoo America and Soul of the South schedules, added to the schedule of cable network Pop, and offered to various local stations.

==Series history==
===Original series (2002-2015)===
&quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; was conceived out of a desire by station owner ACME Communications to increase original content to its stations&#x27; schedules, most of which aired infomercials and reruns in its morning drive hours, and to bolster local ad revenue for those stations. &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; formally launched on the morning of September 16, 2002, airing on 10 ACME-owned stations, all of which were affiliates of The WB Television Network, including the station from which it originated during its first two years on-air, WBDT in Dayton, Ohio. The original on-air talent included anchors Ron Corning and Andrea Jackson, newsreader Peggy Bunker, and weather and features presenter Mitch English.

From its launch, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; employed a personality-driven on-air approach, one that was looser, faster in pace, and sometimes edgy in comparison to tradition-bound network morning television shows broadcast by ABC (&quot;Good Morning America&quot;), CBS (&quot;The Early Show&quot;), and NBC (&quot;Today&quot;): Slang terms, pop music, and host commentaries would be interjected in the news summaries. Pop culture segments were liberally employed (see below). The hosts&#x27; employed not-as-formal forms of dress and demeanor (dancing in the lead-outs to commercial breaks were not uncommon). And above all, the liveliness trumped the serious. The lively tone was intentional, as it was meant to attract an audience that was younger in age and were more likely to get their news from sources other than traditional local and network TV newscasts. As Andrea Jackson described it to the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; in 2005, &quot;We always talk about [&quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;] as morning radio on television or late-night television in the morning. It&#x27;s infotainment.&quot;

During its early years, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; included several live or prerecorded standing features in its broadcast, all utilizing the show&#x27;s overall irreverent tone. Among the features were:
*&quot;Plugged Into the News&quot; (the latest news headlines, utilizing content from CNN and Associated Press)
*&quot;News by the Numbers&quot; (a highlighting of numerical figures in notable news stories)
*&quot;Keeping Them Honest&quot; (a clearinghouse for the most ridiculous government- and politically-themed news)
*&quot;Mitch&#x27;s World&quot; (Mitch English giving his take on the news, ending the segment with a story-related punchline)
*&quot;Old School&quot; (poking fun at vintage commercials, PSAs, and instructional/educational films)
*&quot;Viewer Calls&quot; (calls from actual viewers to a &quot;Daily Buzz&quot; hotline augmented for TV through the use of 2-frame animation)
*&quot;Water Cooler&quot; (viewer comments shared by Clayton Morris)

On January 1, 2004, ACME Communications would sell a 50% interest in &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; to fellow broadcaster Emmis Communications. The deal would lead in a relocation of the show in August 2004 from Dayton to the Orlando, Florida area, and into the Lake Mary studios of Emmis-owned WKCF. In early 2007, WKCF moved to WESH&#x27;s studios in Winter Park after WESH owners Hearst-Argyle Television acquired WKCF to create a duopoly in the Orlando market; soon afterward, Emmis sold its stake in &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; back to ACME.

In mid-April 2007, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;″s previous studios were acquired by faith-based Trinity Broadcasting Network and Good Life Broadcasting for new studios for their respective stations, WTGL-TV (now WHLV-TV) and WLCB-TV (the present-day WTGL). At this time, the show also changed Orlando affiliates, from WKCF to WRDQ, and relocated for six weeks to a temporary home inside the Disney-MGM Studios. The show&#x27;s time at Disney was an interim period until new, permanent studios were completed on the campus of Full Sail University in Winter Park in June 2007. &quot;The Daily Buzz&#x27;s&quot; first show at Full Sail aired on June 19, 2007, and they continued to broadcast there until the show&#x27;s 2015 cancellation.

By the end of the 2000s decade, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; would mature somewhat in tone: Many of the show&#x27;s looser recurring segments, including some of those mentioned above, were phased out, and &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; began to utilize a tone that was tighter and more organized yet still utilizing some of the humor and irreverence it had used since its debut. Also by this time, &quot;Buzz&quot; producers would allow the show&#x27;s affiliates two windows each hour to insert their own local content, with national content continuing for stations who did not insert their own segments. The likely genesis for this move was the success of ACME-owned &quot;Buzz&quot; affiliate WBUW-Madison, Wisconsin, who began adding their own segments (&quot;Buzzed Into Madison&quot;) in early 2007.

In 2010, Fisher Communications joined ACME Communications on a licensing and consulting agreement for &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;. The agreement allowed Fisher to take over production of the show on ACME&#x27;s behalf (they would move production to HD in 2010), and gave Fisher the option of purchasing the show from ACME. The agreement also allowed Fisher to create Buzz Brands, a service that offered multimedia content, both local in nature and from &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;, to local affiliates for multiple media platforms (including TV, online, and even radio). The first Buzz Brand platform to launch was &quot;GalTime,&quot; a female-oriented platform that began with an October 2010 soft launch before expanding nationwide in early 2011; &quot;HeadDrama,&quot; which is geared toward advice on mental health concerns, became the second Buzz Brand platform in May 2011. All of the &quot;Buzz Brand&quot; platforms would eventually be phased out, though content from &quot;Emotional Mojo&quot;, a Mojo Brands-produced program featuring advice on personal development, would be featured on &quot;Buzz&quot; segments until the shows&#x27; 2015 cancellation.

On August 6, 2012, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; unveiled what may have been its most noteworthy transition, introducing a new anchor team that featured actor Charles Divins, veteran TV anchor Lisa Spooner, &quot;CMT’s Top 20 Countdown&quot; host Lance Smith, and radio personality Jessica Reyes. Original co-host Andrea Jackson remained with the program to host recurring interview segments until October 2013; fellow &quot;Buzz&quot; veterans Andy Campbell, Mitch English and Kia Malone left the series outright.

By the first quarter of 2013, &quot;Daily Buzz&quot; owner ACME Communications and operator Fisher Communications had been in the process of a gradual exit from the television business (ACME sold its last remaining TV stations in 2012 and would dissolve as a corporation in 2016; Fisher was in the process of being merged into Sinclair Broadcast Group). On April 1, 2013, ACME sold &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;, its last remaining TV property, to Mojo Brands Media. As part of the transaction, Sinclair began to broadcast &quot;Buzz&quot; on some of its stations beginning in the 2013-14 season; the group had previously not carried the show, with many of its The CW Television Network, MyNetworkTV, and independent stations preferring to carry E/I or paid programming in their morning time slots instead.

===Cancellation (2015)===
&quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; unexpectedly ceased production after its April 17, 2015 episode. In an interview that day with the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Mojo Brands Media COO Troy McGuire noted the cancellation was due to a disagreement with an investor in Mojo, who as a result withdrew their financial support in the company. McGuire did not elaborate further in the interview, citing legal reasons. Details would surface, however, in court documents related to Mojo&#x27;s Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation filing on May 5, 2015: One creditor of the company, Richard Botnick, had filed suit against Mojo earlier in 2015, alleging the company fell behind on their debt obligations and had defaulted on a loan they made with Botnick. After Botnick&#x27;s company obtained a garnishment against their bank accounts, Mojo made the decision to immediately cancel &quot;Buzz&quot; as well as sister program &quot;Emotional Mojo&quot;.

The cancellations of both &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; and &quot;Emotional Mojo&quot; resulted in the loss of 37 positions involved in the production of both shows, many of whom, it was revealed in Mojo Brands&#x27; bankruptcy filing, were still owed money for wages and other expenses. Since &quot;Buzz&quot;″s demise had a sudden, immediate effect, there was no opportunity for an on-air goodbye from the show&#x27;s staff, who had hoped to reconvene at a later date and deliver an online farewell and thank-you to the show&#x27;s audience, a plan that would not come to fruition.

&quot;Buzz&quot;, as a daily show, would leave behind a legacy of being, as termed by reviving company KEF Media, &quot;the gold standard of combining news, hot topics, and [product] integration in a fun, seamless format.&quot; Indeed, by the mid-2010s, many national breakfast television programs, and news programs in general, would begin to utilize a not-as-staid presentation. Nationally, Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; has long incorporated lively banter and opinions; broadcast shows such as &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot; would over time begin to increase their own entertainment, pop culture, and &quot;water cooler&quot; discussion segments; and Tribune Broadcasting would follow suit, launching &quot;EyeOpener&quot; on a handful of its stations in 2011 and replacing it with the social media-oriented &quot;Morning Dose&quot; in 2017.

===Revival (2017-present)===
In May 2017, two years after Mojo Brands Media&#x27;s bankruptcy led to the cancellation of &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;, broadcast and digital public relations company KEF Media announced that it would revive &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;, after acquiring the show&#x27;s trademark and branding. Contradicting its title somewhat, the show would be offered initially to broadcasters as a one-hour, once-per-week series (also available as a half-hour weekly series, as it airs on Youtoo), in addition having daily updates on digital platforms. Additional broadcast and digital airings would eventually be added as the show grows.

&quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; would return to air the weekend of June 18, 2017 (two weekends later than previously announced). As with the original version of the show, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; includes various features on news, pop culture, gossip, entertainment, and other subjects. The show also offers &quot;vertical&quot; segments on consumer affairs, fashion, finance, healthy, hospitality, sports, and travel, utilizing integration of content from the show&#x27;s sponsors.

The revived &quot;Daily Buzz&quot; originates from the same studios as the daily version prior to its 2015 cancellation (Full Sail University in Orlando), and is overseen by many of the creative and production personnel from the first incarnation. Two former &quot;Buzz&quot; hosts have also returned to host the revival, Lance Smith and Kia Malone. Scott Carty (based in Los Angeles) and Josh McBride (based in New York City), joined at the restart as entertainment correspondents, with Howard Henley and Summer Jackson joining later as West Coast and East Coast correspondents respectively.

==Distribution==
===2002-2015===
At the time of its April 2015 cancellation, the original version of &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; aired in 149 television markets across the United States, reaching roughly 80.9 million homes and 70.9% of the US population. (The show reached roughly 175 markets at its peak.) Rather than airing on stations affiliated with the Big 3 broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC), which rely on their own newscasts and that of those networks, &quot;Buzz&quot; was offered and sold to various larger- or-middle-sized markets affiliated with Fox, MyNetworkTV, The CW, or independents such as WRDQ in Orlando, &quot;The Daily Buzz&#x27;s&quot; home city.

In markets where, for various reasons, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; could not be offered to individual stations, the show was featured on the schedules of cable network Youtoo TV as well as that of digital subchannel network Soul of the South; both networks aired the show on late-morning tape-delay. The show was also featured live-to-air on The CW Plus, The CW network&#x27;s service for small-market stations (roughly those ranked 100 or lower), an arrangement that ended in September 2014.

Though many stations that aired &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; showed the full 2-hour broadcast live-to-air during the 5 a.m.-7 a.m. (ET) time slot, a few stations carried only one hour of the program, while others tape-delayed all or part of the show for a mid- or late-morning airing (between 7-11 a.m.). The full &quot;Daily Buzz&quot; broadcast also streamed live-to-air online, weekday mornings between 5:00 a.m.–7:00 a.m. (ET) through the program&#x27;s website. The show was also uploaded daily post-broadcast to Hulu.

During Mojo Brands Media&#x27;s 2013 acquisition of &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;, the company announced plans to distribute the program to international markets in the Caribbean and Latin America. At the time of &quot;Buzz&quot;″s cancellation, it was unclear if or how the show was offered internationally.

The 2015 cancellation of &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; left the show&#x27;s affiliates scrambling for replacement programming to fill the abandoned time slots on their schedules, be it other syndicated shows (a route WCWF/Green Bay would take with second airings of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;), barter lifestyle programming (the route WCGV-TV/Milwaukee would take), paid programming, straight rebroadcasts of a sister station&#x27;s morning newscast until the fall (which WFNA/Gulf Shores-Mobile, Alabama would do), or their own local content. One &quot;Buzz&quot; affiliate&#x27;s program director, commenting to the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; the day of &quot;Buzz&quot;″s cancellation, felt &quot;more than a little steamed&quot; that he learned of the show&#x27;s demise second-hand. Mojo Brands&#x27; McGuire, in that same &quot;Sentinel&quot; interview, noted that his company, for its part, was in the process of notifying and working with &quot;Buzz&quot; affiliates post-cancellation, suggesting that the show&#x27;s demise was &quot;as unexpected for us as for the affiliates.&quot;

Note: The below list is a partial compilation of noteworthy &quot;Daily Buzz&quot; affiliates at the time of the show&#x27;s 2015 closure and should not be construed a complete list of stations that aired the program. A January 2015 full list of markets and stations where &quot;Buzz&quot; was available is posted on the Mojo Brands Media website.

===2017-present===
The 2017 revival of &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; is being carried on both the Soul of the South and Youtoo America networks, both of which carried the original program prior to its 2015 cancellation. Soul of the South airs the program Friday mornings at 8AM (ET), while Youtoo America airs it Saturday mornings at 5AM (ET). &quot;Buzz&quot; also airs Thursday mornings (8:30AM ET) on the cable network Pop. It is unclear as to how many over-the-air stations offer &quot;Buzz&quot; on its schedules, although it is shown on the schedule of at least one former affiliate of the previous &quot;Buzz&quot; version (WIFS/Madison, the former WBUW). Video of &quot;Buzz&quot; segments also air on the program&#x27;s website, DailyBuzzTV.com, as well as through its official Facebook page.

<text>The Tāmaki Strait is an area of the Hauraki Gulf in the Auckland Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The strait is east of the Waitematā Harbour, and is located between Waiheke Island, East Auckland and the Pōhutukawa Coast.

==Geography==
The Tāmaki Strait is located to the east of Auckland, south of Waiheke Island and north of the Pōhutukawa Coast. During the Last Glacial Maximum (known locally as the Ōtira Glaciation), the area was primarily a flat river valley, until between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago when sea levels rose. The westernmost points of the strait are Rangitoto Island and Achilles Point, and the easternmost are Ponui Island and Raukura Point. Within the strait is Te Matuku Marine Reserve, on the south-eastern coast of Waiheke Island.

The strait is shallow, with the majority of the area being within 10 metres under sea-level.

== History ==

The Tāmaki Strait was one of the locations visited by the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka, as the crew explored the eastern bays of the Auckland Region. The area was explored by Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki ancestor Peretū. The strait&#x27;s traditional name is Te Maraetai, meaning &quot;Marae Enclosed by the Tides&quot;, referring to how the sheltered ocean of the strait acted like a flat marae ātea (marae entrance courtyard). An alternative name that was used was (&quot;The Long Channel&quot;).

<text>Roberto Urbano Viaux Marambio (May 25, 1917 in Talca – September 5, 2005 in Santiago) was a Chilean Army General and the primary planner of two attempted coups d&#x27;état in Chile in 1969 and 1970. The first was against President Eduardo Frei Montalva, and the second sought to prevent Socialist Salvador Allende&#x27;s election.

==Biography==
Prior to his involvement in the René Schneider case, Viaux was a very well respected and admired military leader. He became famous when he led a small military insurrection (the &quot;Tacnazo&quot;) on October 21, 1969. In the &quot;Tacnazo&quot;, Viaux shut himself up with the Tacna regiment inside its barracks and went on a strike. He demanded a pay-raise for the Army and the resignation of both the Defense Minister and the Army Commander-in-Chief. After tense negotiations with the government, he ended his strike when the Commander-in-Chief resigned and the government promised to study his salary demands.

On October 22, 1970, coup plotters loyal to Viaux attempted to kidnap constitutionalist Chilean Army Commander-in-chief General René Schneider, who was adamantly opposed to any prospect of a coup. General Schneider&#x27;s official car was ambushed at a street intersection in the capital city of Santiago, Chile. When the general drew a gun to defend himself, he was shot point-blank several times. Though he was rushed to a military hospital, General Schneider&#x27;s wounds proved fatal and he died three days later, on October 25. General Viaux was later convicted of involvement with the plot and imprisoned.

Critics of U.S. policy in Chile at the time, including journalist Christopher Hitchens, have accused former U.S. National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger of conspiring with Viaux in the murder of General Schneider. Yet declassified U.S. documents show that the Central Intelligence Agency had explored the possibility of supporting a Viaux coup but decided that his ideology was &quot;far out&quot; and, while maintaining contact with him, did not provide direct support. In a declassified October 15 conversation with President Richard Nixon, Kissinger said, &quot;This looks hopeless. I turned it off. Nothing could be worse than an abortive coup.&quot;

Although contact with the Viaux group was ended, a cable from CIA headquarters to the Santiago station reveals that the CIA did arrange the delivery of submachine guns and ammunition to a group led by General Valenzuela; Schneider was shot later that same day. The weapons, along with $50,000, were later recovered by U.S. military attaché to Chile Colonel Wilmert after he &quot;pistol-whipped&quot; General Valenzuela, who at first refused to hand the money over. Wilmert then drove to Vina del Mar, where he threw the submachine guns into the Pacific Ocean.

In August, 1973, Viaux was released and exiled to Paraguay. He was not involved in the successful Chilean coup of 1973, and was allowed to return to Chile only in 1990, by President Patricio Aylwin. Viaux lived quietly in retirement in Santiago, until his death on September 5, 2005.

<doc id="1214377" wikidata="Q4134258" url="?curid=1214377" title="Goucher College">
<text>Goucher College ( &quot;&quot;) is a private liberal arts college in Towson, Maryland. Founded in 1885 as a non-denominational women&#x27;s college in Baltimore&#x27;s central district, the college is named for pastor and missionary John F. Goucher, who enlisted local leaders of the Methodist Episcopal Church to establish the school&#x27;s charter. Goucher relocated to its Towson campus in 1953 and became coeducational in 1986.

Goucher grants BA and BS degrees in a range of disciplines across 31 majors and 39 minors. Goucher is one of only two colleges in the United States to integrate a study abroad experience into its undergraduate curriculum requirements and the only one to provide options for students to fulfill that requirement through either a three-week faculty-led Intensive Course Abroad (ICA) during a winter or summer session, or a traditional semester or year-long study abroad program at one of the over 80 different institutions around the world with whom the college has reciprocal student exchange programs with. Goucher is a member of the Landmark Conference and competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III in lacrosse, tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, and horseback riding. Goucher partners with nearby Johns Hopkins University, Loyola University Maryland, and the University of Baltimore to allow students to earn accelerated post-graduate or combined undergraduate degrees. Goucher also offers a postbaccalaureate premedical program, master&#x27;s programs in the arts and humanities, and professional development courses in writing and education. , Goucher enrolls approximately 1,100 undergraduates and 900 post-graduates. Loren Pope profiled Goucher among forty institutions of higher learning in his 1996 book &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;.

Goucher counts notable alumni in law, business, journalism, academia, and government, including conservative journalist Jonah Goldberg, former First Lady of Puerto Rico Lucé Vela, Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander of the District Court for the District of Maryland, 27th Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard Sally Brice-O&#x27;Hara, former president of First Republic Bank Katherine August-DeWilde, and the third president of California State University, San Marcos, Karen S. Haynes.

==History==
Early in its history, Goucher played an important role nationally in providing women access to higher education. Many ground-breaking women doctors, researchers, and scientists graduated from Goucher in the early 20th century, including Hattie Alexander, Florence B. Seibert, and Margaret Irving Handy. Judge Sarah T. Hughes of Texas, who was famously photographed administering the presidential oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson aboard Air Force One, graduated from Goucher in 1917. A daughter of President Woodrow Wilson, Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre, also graduated Goucher and went on to play a significant role in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

=== 19th century ===

In 1881, the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church passed a resolution to found a seminary. The proposal was met with some objection, with one member stating, &quot;I would not give a fig for a weakling little thing of a seminary. We want such a school, so ample in its provisions, of such dignity in its buildings, so fully provided with the best apparatus, that it shall draw to itself the eyes of the community and that young people shall feel it an honor to be enrolled among its students.&quot; Minister and conference member John B. Van Meter asserted &quot;that the Conference [should] make the foundation and endowment of a female college the single object of its organized effort.&quot;

Van Meter was joined by fellow minister John Franklin Goucher (1845–1922) and together they eventually persuaded the conference to found a college, instead. Subsequently, the Women&#x27;s College of Baltimore City (&quot;City&quot; was later dropped) was chartered on January 26, 1885. It opened its doors in 1888, and four years later graduated its first class of just five students.

John F. Goucher, despite being the school&#x27;s namesake and co-founder, was not the college&#x27;s first president. Although offered the post, he declined, and it went to William Hersey Hopkins, who had served as president of St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis. After Hopkins resigned in 1890 to join the faculty, the board of trustees voted unanimously to renominate Goucher. Under pressure from the board, Goucher relented and accepted the position, which he held for nearly two decades. Goucher and his wife Mary Cecilia Fisher made significant financial contributions to the college, including the bequest of a portion of his estate.

=== 20th century ===
During President Goucher&#x27;s tenure, enrollment grew but the college suffered financial deficits. In 1904, the college became the second in Maryland to establish a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, after Johns Hopkins University. Goucher stepped down in 1908 to resume his international missionary work but remained involved with the school as president emeritus until his death in 1922. In 1910, the school was renamed Goucher College in his honor.

In 1913, the college inaugurated its fourth president, William W. Guth, who oversaw the construction of several new residence halls and a successful million-dollar fundraising campaign. Around this time, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, whose daughter Jessie was a Goucher alumna, expressed support for the college&#x27;s fundraising efforts in correspondence with the administration, writing in March 1913, &quot;It would, indeed, be ... evidence that our great educational public does not fully understand its own interests if an institution which has served with such faithfulness ... in the cause of woman&#x27;s education should be allowed to break up for the lack of money.&quot; By 1914, Goucher was one of six &quot;Class I&quot; colleges for women in the U.S.

In 1921, Goucher purchased 421 acres of land in nearby Towson that had belonged to the estate of a prominent Baltimore family, for $150,000. The move from Baltimore to the Towson suburbs was completed in 1953. Before 1950, Goucher hosted nearly a dozen sorority chapters on campus including Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Gamma Phi Beta, and Pi Beta Phi, but they were disbanded on the move to Towson.

Goucher turned coeducational in 1986 when the board of trustees voted to admit men, citing declining enrollment and reduced national interest by women in single-sex colleges. The decision was controversial among many students and a minority of alumnae. However it was followed by increased enrollment and sustained support from the school&#x27;s donors, with Goucher&#x27;s endowment growing nearly five-fold from $45 million in 1986. President Rhoda M. Dorsey, who also initially resisted the proposal, relented and presided over the transition.

==== Old Goucher ====

Goucher&#x27;s former Baltimore campus became known as Old Goucher. The school maintained no affiliation with the property after its sale. The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Many of its Romanesque structures have been preserved and re-purposed for commercial, public, and residential use. The school&#x27;s Towson campus was added to the historic register in 2007.

==Campus==
Goucher occupies a green, wooded campus that is proximate and northeast to downtown Towson. Surrounding the central campus infrastructure is a dense forest, owned by the school, which features low hills and hiking and jogging trails, some of which are also used by the college&#x27;s equestrian riders. The non-denominational Haebler Memorial Chapel lies near the center of campus. A walking path, called the Van Meter Highway, connects to most of the college&#x27;s residential, academic, recreational, and athletic buildings, while one road, the Loop Road, circles campus. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine described the campus as &quot;unusually bucolic.&quot; It has also been referred to by CBS Baltimore as one of Baltimore County&#x27;s most scenic college campuses. A scene at the fictional Hammond University from the fourth season of the Netflix series &quot;House of Cards&quot; was filmed on Goucher&#x27;s campus, with most shots taking place at the Athenaeum and the Rhoda M. Dorsey College Center.

=== Academic buildings ===

Goucher&#x27;s main academic buildings, including Van Meter Hall and Julia Rogers, are located at the northern portion of campus, called the &quot;academic quad&quot;. The Hoffberger Science Building houses the school&#x27;s science departments and is adjacent to the Meyerhoff Arts Building, which contains a theater, photo studio, and several galleries and where the dance, theater, and art departments are based. Student Administrative Services and the admissions office are located in the Rhoda M. Dorsey College Center. Near the center of the campus and opposite Mary Fisher Hall is the Athenaeum, or &quot;the Ath,&quot; a modern, multipurpose facility built in 2009 encompassing the main library, a restaurant, classrooms, lecture halls, and an open auditorium. The Athenaeum is where speakers who visit the campus are typically hosted. The Merrick Lecture Hall, a partial amphitheater situated near Van Meter Hall, is also a venue for on-campus recitals, performances, sponsored political debates, and other productions. The college is fundraising to build its Science Innovation Center, which will be a 44,000-square foot annex to the Hoffberger Science Building.

=== Housing ===

The college&#x27;s residence halls are concentrated on the south side of campus. They are Heubeck, Froelicher, Stimson, Mary Fisher, Sondheim, Stimson, Welsh Hall, known by students as &quot;the T&quot; for its T-shaped design, which was completed in 2005. In 2018, the school completed construction of the &quot;First-year Village&quot; for freshmen, which includes Pagliaro Selz Hall, Fireside Hall, and Trustees Hall. Campus housing for students includes singles, doubles, triples, suites, and on-campus apartments. Sondheim is the sole residence hall designated as substance-free. In July 2018, Goucher announced a campus-wide ban on cigarettes and smoking devices like electronic cigarettes.

=== Athletic and recreational facilities ===
The campus&#x27;s outdoor sports facilities include a 107,000 square foot turf stadium field named Gopher Stadium, three grass practice fields, an outdoor track, twelve tennis courts that opened in 2019 as part of the Evelyn Dyke Schroedl &#x27;62 Tennis Center, as well as separate courts for racquetball and squash, and an equestrian center. The Decker Sports and Recreation Center contains a six-lane, 25-yard pool, dance studios, a basketball court, gymnasium, varsity locker rooms, a fully equipped weight room, and a cardio fitness center. The equestrian center lies on the northernmost edge of campus and contains two barns, 10 turnout paddocks, indoor and outdoor riding rings, and several riding fields, in addition to wooded trails shared with pedestrians.
=== Design, layout, and sustainability ===
The architectural design firm responsible for planning the campus, Moore and Hutchins, elected to group buildings together into informal zones based on function, departing from the Romanesque style of the previous Baltimore campus. The buildings on campus are clad in tan-colored Butler stone chosen to reflect a Modernist theme. Over the years, the architecture of the campus has won numerous awards. The campus has also been recognized for its commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency, being called a &quot;Top 25 Green College.&quot; In 2009, Goucher announced a goal for all new and existing buildings to achieve at least a Silver rating according to the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building certification system. In 2007, the campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The campus underwent significant changes when in 2017 several of its primary residential buildings were relocated as part of an extensive plan to construct a &quot;First-year Village&quot; comprising modernized residential halls and recreational facilities for newly matriculated freshmen. The new freshmen dorms have a capacity of 450 and opened in the fall of 2018. These developments coincided with substantial renovations to Mary Fisher Hall, with its campus cafe upgraded to a full-fledged, 550-seat dining hall. Goucher also announced plans to build a new Science Research Center to provide additional lab space and resources for expanded biology, chemistry, and environmental science departments. To raise capital for these projects, Goucher initiated a fundraising campaign to raise $100 million from alumni and other donors, of which it has raised $96 million.

==Academics==

=== Rankings and reputation ===
In the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; annual college rankings for 2021, Goucher tied for 120th among national liberal arts colleges, 11th in Most Innovative Schools, 72nd in Social Mobility, and 5th in Study Abroad. &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2019 ranked Goucher at 138 in Liberal Arts Universities, 161 in the Northeast, 272 nationally among private colleges, and 410 overall among the best 650 colleges and universities in the U.S. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Goucher 67th among liberal arts colleges in 2019.

The &quot;Princeton Review&quot; included Goucher in its 2019 edition of the &quot;Best 384 Colleges&quot; and ranked it No. 5 in &quot;Most Popular Study Abroad Program.” Goucher was recognized as a top producer of Fulbright scholars by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; in 2018. It was also profiled in the book &quot;Colleges that Change Lives&quot; by Loren Pope as one of forty institutions. The school was one of the first in the country to require a study abroad of all undergraduates, along with Susquehanna University and Soka University of America.

=== Admissions ===
Goucher&#x27;s admissions process is rated as &quot;selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the class of 2022, Goucher received 3,474 applications and had an acceptance rate of 79%. Goucher has been SAT-optional since 2006.

In 2014, the school received national coverage when it announced it would accept video-only applications without transcripts, essays, or test scores. The decision was criticized by some who suggested that doing so represented a lowering of standards. The school defended the decision as part of an effort to increase diversity among the student body and later reported that the average GPA of students admitted via the video application process met or exceeded that of students who submitted traditional applications. For 2021, the average matriculated student&#x27;s GPA was 3.14, with those reporting, the average SAT score was 1200, and average ACT score was 25.

===Undergraduate level===

As of 2023, students choose from 31 majors, including an individualized interdisciplinary major, and 39 minors; there are also special orientation courses for first-year students. The most popular majors are in the humanities and social sciences, languages, biological sciences, and performing arts. Goucher is also well-known for its creative writing, dance, and pre-med departments. The student-faculty ratio is 10:1, and the average class size is 16. The college also offers 4+1 bachelor’s/master’s programs itself and with Johns Hopkins University, Loyola University Maryland, Middlebury College, and University of Maryland, Baltimore and a dual degree engineering program with Columbia University. Goucher is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

Goucher began requiring all undergraduates to study abroad in 2006, which was the most notable of several reforms to the school&#x27;s curriculum in that period. A popular choice for students is a three-week course abroad during the winter, spring, or summer. Goucher offers over 60 semester and yearlong study-abroad programs in 30 countries but allows students to register in programs by other schools. Undergraduates are also expected to either complete an internship, participate in community engagement work, or work as a faculty research assistant. Goucher sponsors a competitive grant program for students participating in summer internships.

In 2017, Goucher instituted a revamped set of general education requirements into the curriculum called &quot;Goucher Commons&quot; including a first-year seminar, emphasis on writing, data analytics, and foreign language and culture, a capstone course, and inquiry into at least two areas. In 2018, Goucher announced plans to eliminate seven majors, including mathematics, physics, religion, music, and Russian studies, following a &quot;Program Prioritization Process&quot; involving faculty which cited low overall interest in those majors among students. The school said that advanced courses in these subjects will remain part of the overall curriculum and that the class of 2022 and students that were studying in those majors will be unaffected by the change.

===Graduate level===

Goucher&#x27;s graduate program is run out of the Welch Center for Graduate and Professional Studies, which is named for late former acting president Robert S. Welch. The school grants Master of Arts, Master of Education, and Master of Fine Arts degrees in fields including art and technology and historic preservation.

===Certificate and other programs===
Since 1993, Goucher has offered a full-time post-baccalaureate pre-medical program with 96% of students over the course of its history gaining acceptance to medical school and 99.7% over the past decade. The program accepts approximately 32 students annually. It has linkage agreements with several schools including the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, George Washington University School of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

Goucher also grants certificates through a program for teachers called the AP (Advanced Placement) Summer Institute recognizing specialties with at-risk learners, middle school, reading instruction, improving school leadership, and educational technology.

=== Goucher Prison Education Partnership ===
In 2012, Goucher founded the Goucher Prison Education Partnership (GPEP), a division of the college that expands the academic community to include individuals incarcerated in two Maryland state prisons. In 2015, GPEP hosted the Department of Education at the Maryland Correctional Institution - Jessup (MCI-J) to announce the Second Chance Pell Grant pilot program and became one of 67 colleges selected in 2016 to provide individuals incarcerated in the U.S. the opportunity to use federal Pell grants to earn college credits. Goucher offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in American Studies to students enrolled through GPEP. The division primarily operates on private grants and donations raised by its staff, with some funds provided through federal Pell grants. Each year, around 130 GPEP students at MCI-J and the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women (MCIW) enroll in college classes taught by faculty from Goucher and other local colleges and universities.

==Student life==
===Clubs and extracurriculars===
Goucher has over 60 student-run clubs including the Chem Club, which is the oldest continuously operating club on campus, , an a capella group called Red Hot Blue, a poetry club, a black student union called Umoja, Model United Nations, and a student-labor action committee. The college publishes a bi-weekly student newspaper called &quot;The Quindecim&quot; and a literary arts journal called &quot;Preface&quot;. Other media run by the school is Goucher Student Radio, which contains a host of student, staff, and faculty programming and is streamed online. Many students participate in Goucher Student Government, which holds elections, oversees the activities of clubs, passes resolutions, and votes on matters affecting the general student body. Similar to other private liberal arts schools in the northeast, Goucher no longer recognizes any fraternities or sororities on campus.

===Athletics===

Goucher&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Gophers. In 2007 the college joined the Landmark Conference after competing as a member of the Capital Athletic Conference from 1991 to 2007. Goucher competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III, fielding men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in lacrosse, soccer, basketball, track and field, cross country, golf, swimming, and tennis, as well as women&#x27;s teams in field hockey and volleyball. Goucher also competes nationally in co-ed equestrian sports through the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association.

===Demographics===
Approximately 67% of undergraduates are female. About 37% of the student body identifies as African-American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native-American. Goucher also has one of the highest percentages of Jewish students in the country at 26%, according to Hillel International. Goucher attracts students both nationally and internationally; undergraduates in 2017 came from 46 states and 50 countries. Twenty-five percent of students qualify for Pell Grants, and Goucher has been recognized for its success in graduating Pell Grant recipients compared to the national average. For the class of 2022, the top five represented home states were Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey, and 26% of the incoming class were first-generation college students, while more than one-third of that class were in the top 20% of their graduating high school class.

===Other activities on campus===
Goucher has hosted the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth summer program for gifted students. Goucher students conceived the nationally popular campus game Humans vs. Zombies, which is organized by students annually, and the commercial party game &quot;Cards Against Humanity&quot;. Another of the school&#x27;s annual traditions is GIG, &quot;Get into Goucher,&quot; in which students participate in campus-wide celebrations, concerts, and other festivities. Goucher also hosts English as a second language and computer literacy classes under a program called the Futuro Latino Learning Center, run by students and college instructors.

==== Goucher College Poll ====
The school regularly conducts the Goucher College Poll, which operates under the Sarah T. Hughes Center for Politics, a member of the Association of Academic Survey Research Organizations and the American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative. The Goucher College Poll is conducted by phone and asks Maryland residents statewide their opinions on politics, the economy, and cultural issues. The polling is performed by Goucher students out of a 40-station computer-aided telephone interview lab. The poll is typically conducted twice a year, and a methodology statement is provided with each release. The results are covered in local and regional media like &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

The Hallowed Ground Project started in 2018, as the Goucher History Project, to research the history of the enslaved people who were forced to live and labor on the land in Towson prior to emancipation in the state in 1864. Students and faculty are working to digitize records and develop initiatives to acknowledge the history of slavery on the campus’ land through the curriculum and other means. Goucher College has also joined the Universities Studying Slavery (USS) consortium.

==Notable faculty and alumni==
Well-known Goucher faculty and professors emeritus include Jean H. Baker and Julie Roy Jeffrey of the history department, Nancy Hubbard from the business and accounting department, president emeritus Sanford J. Ungar, and authors Madison Smartt Bell and Elizabeth Spires, who oversee the college&#x27;s Kratz Center for Creative Writing.

Goucher has over 21,000 living alumni, and many of its graduates have gone on to make contributions in the arts and literature, sciences, journalism, business, academia, government, and other fields.

Historical alumni include women scientists like Helen Dodson Prince, Ruth Bleier, and Florence Seibert, and doctors like Bessie L. Moses (graduated 1915), who was founder of Baltimore&#x27;s Bureau for Contraceptive Advice, and Georgeanna Seegar Jones. Other historical graduates include Mary Cromwell Jarrett, who made scientific breakthroughs within post-traumatic stress disorder studies, Judge Sarah T. Hughes, who swore in Lyndon B. Johnson to the presidency, former First Daughter Jessie Woodrow Wilson, and the Academy-Award nominated actress Mildred Dunnock.

Living alumni include authors Sarah Pinsker, Darcey Steinke, and Jesse J.

<text>Black Orpheus (Portuguese: Orfeu Negro ) is a 1959 romantic tragedy film directed by French filmmaker Marcel Camus and starring Marpessa Dawn and Breno Mello. It is based on the play &quot;Orfeu da Conceição&quot; by Vinicius de Moraes, which set the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice in a contemporary &quot;favela&quot; in Rio de Janeiro during &quot;Carnaval&quot;. The film was an international co-production among companies in Brazil, France and Italy.

The film is particularly noted for its soundtrack by two Brazilian composers: Antônio Carlos Jobim, whose song &quot;A felicidade&quot; opens the film, and Luiz Bonfá, whose &quot;Manhã de Carnaval&quot; and &quot;Samba de Orfeu&quot; have become classics of bossa nova. The songs performed by Orfeu were dubbed by singer Agostinho dos Santos. Lengthy passages of filming took place in the Morro da Babilônia, a favela in the Leme neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro.

&quot;Black Orpheus&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, the 1960 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the 1960 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film and was nominated for the 1961 BAFTA Award for Best Film.

While the 1959 adaptation has been celebrated internationally, it has been criticized by Brazilians and scholars for exoticizing Brazil for an international audience and reinforcing harmful stereotypes.

==Plot==
A marble Greek bas-relief explodes, revealing Afro-Brazilian men dancing the samba to drums in a favela. Eurydice arrives in Rio de Janeiro and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu. New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes, who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina.

Although engaged to Mira, Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about their upcoming marriage. The couple goes to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu&#x27;s name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for Carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring.

When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man whom she believes wants to kill her. The man – Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume – finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina&#x27;s sailor boyfriend Chico shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed, and they make love.

Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her Queen of the Night costume so that she can spend more time with Chico. A veil conceals Eurydice&#x27;s face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira.

Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydice&#x27;s veil. Eurydice is forced once again to run for her life, first from Mira and then from Death. Trapped in Orfeu&#x27;s own trolley station, she hangs from a power line to get away from Death and is accidentally killed by Orfeu when he turns the power on and electrocutes her. Death tells Orfeu, &quot;Now she&#x27;s mine,&quot; before knocking him out.

Distraught, Orfeu looks for Eurydice at the Office of Missing Persons, although Hermes has told him she is dead. The building is deserted at night, with only a janitor sweeping up. He tells Orfeu that the place holds only papers and that no people can be found there. Taking pity on Orfeu, the janitor takes him down a large darkened spiral staircase – a reference to the mythical Orpheus&#x27; descent into the underworld – to a Macumba ritual, a regional form of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé.

At the gate, they pass a guard dog named Cerberus. During the ritual, the janitor tells Orfeu to call to his beloved by singing. The spirit of Eurydice inhabits the body of an old woman and speaks to him. Orfeu wants to gaze upon her, but Eurydice begs him not to, lest he lose her forever. When he turns and looks anyway, he sees the old woman, and Eurydice&#x27;s spirit departs, as in the Greek myth.

Orfeu wanders in mourning. He retrieves Eurydice&#x27;s body from the city morgue and carries her in his arms across town and up the hill toward his home, where his shack is burning. A vengeful Mira flings a stone that hits him in the head and knocks him over a cliff to his death, with Eurydice still in his arms.

Two children, Benedito and Zeca – who have followed Orfeu throughout the film – believe Orfeu&#x27;s tale that his guitar playing causes the sun to rise every morning. After Orfeu&#x27;s death, Benedito insists that Zeca pick up the guitar and play so that the sun will rise. Zeca plays, and the sun comes up. A little girl appears, gives Zeca a single flower, and the three children dance.

==Cast==

* Breno Mello as Orfeu
* Marpessa Dawn as Eurydice
* Marcel Camus as Ernesto
* Fausto Guerzoni as Fausto
* Lourdes de Oliveira as Mira
* Léa Garcia as Serafina
* Adhemar da Silva as Death
* Alexandro Constantino as Hermes
* Waldemar De Souza as Chico
* Jorge Dos Santos as Benedito
* Aurino Cassiano as Zeca

Notes
* Marpessa Dawn was not from Brazil, but was born near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
* Breno Mello was a soccer player with no acting experience at the time he was cast as Orfeu. Mello was walking on the street in Rio de Janeiro when director Marcel Camus stopped him and asked if he would like to be in a film.
* Da Silva, the actor who played Death, was a triple jumper who won two Olympic gold medals, in 1952 and 1956.
* The role of Zeca was played by Aurino Cassiano, a young musician from a large musical family. With brother Amaury on cavaquinho and Aurino on pandeiro, they performed in the streets, calling themselves &quot;Dupla Chuvisco&quot;. In 1957, they were invited to perform in a film, &quot;Pega Ladrão&quot;, and then Aurino appeared in another, &quot;Vai que é Mole&quot;. It was during the filming of &quot;Vai que é Mole&quot; that Marcel Camus saw Aurino performing on location, and invited him to test for &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 87% from 71 reviews, and an average rating of 7.9/10, with the consensus: &quot;Colorful, atmospheric, and infectious, &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; takes an ancient tale and makes it fresh anew, thanks in part to its bewitching bossa nova soundtrack.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

However, the film has been criticized, especially in Brazil. Vinicius de Moraes, author of the 1956 play &quot;Orfeu da Conceição&quot; upon which the film was based, was outraged and left the theater in the middle of the screening. Critics of the adaptation by Marcel Camus argued that it reinforced various stereotypes about Brazilian culture and society and about Afro-Brazilians specifically, portraying the characters as &quot;simple-minded, overtly sexual, and interested only in singing and dancing.&quot; Setting out to make itself more &quot;appealing&quot; to foreign audiences, the film resorts to a &quot;cheap and problematic exoticism&quot; of Brazil.
===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Black Orpheus&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, the 1960 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the 1960 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film, and was nominated for the 1961 BAFTA Award for Best Film. In the last case, Brazil was credited together with France and Italy. In July 2021, the film was shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.

==Influence==
&quot;Black Orpheus&quot; was cited by artist Jean-Michel Basquiat as one of his early musical influences, while Barack Obama notes in his memoir &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot; (1995) that it was his mother&#x27;s favorite film. Obama, however, did not share his mother&#x27;s preferences upon first watching the film during his first years at Columbia University: &quot;I suddenly realized that the depiction of the childlike blacks I was now seeing on the screen, the reverse image of Conrad&#x27;s dark savages, was what my mother had carried with her to Hawaii all those years before, a reflection of the simple fantasies that had been forbidden to a white, middle-class girl from Kansas, the promise of another life: warm, sensual, exotic, different.&quot;

The film&#x27;s soundtrack also inspired Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s 1962 album &quot;Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus&quot;.

As a child, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho watched the film on Korean television and it made a big impact on him.

Arcade Fire&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Reflektor&quot; (2013) featured themes linked and inspired by the film.

<doc id="1214387" wikidata="Q768888" url="?curid=1214387" title="Miliaria">
<text>Miliaria, commonly known as heat rash, sweat rash, or prickly heat, is a skin disease marked by small, itchy rashes due to sweat trapped under the skin by clogged sweat-gland ducts. Miliaria is a common ailment in hot and humid conditions, such as in the tropics and during the summer. Although it affects people of all ages, it is especially common in children and infants due to their underdeveloped sweat glands.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of miliaria include small, red rashes, called papules, which are irritated and itchy. These may simultaneously occur at a number of areas on a patient&#x27;s body, the most common including the upper chest, neck, elbow creases, under the breasts, and under the scrotum. Other areas include skin folds and areas of the body that may rub against clothing, such as the back, chest, and stomach. 

A related and sometimes simultaneous condition is folliculitis, where hair follicles become plugged with foreign matter, resulting in inflammation.

The symptoms relating to miliaria should not be confused with shingles, as they can be very similar. Shingles is limited to one side of the body, but also has a rash-like appearance. It is also accompanied by a prickly sensation and pain throughout the region. Those who suspect they have shingles and not miliaria should seek medical advice immediately as the sooner antivirals are taken, the better.

==Types==
Miliaria can be classified according to the top level at which obstruction occurs in the sweat glands.

===Miliaria crystallina===
The most superficial obstruction (with the most mild clinical presentation), is known as miliaria crystallina; instead of a rash, the patient presents with multiple, tiny, blister-like lesions that look like beads of perspiration and essentially cause no symptoms. Miliaria crystallina is also known as sudamina or miliaria crystalline. The superficial vesicles are not associated with an inflammatory reaction.

===Miliaria rubra===
The most commonly encountered form of the illness is miliaria rubra, in which obstruction causes leakage of sweat into the deeper layers of the epidermis, provoking a local inflammatory reaction and giving rise to the typical appearance of redness (hence rubra) and larger (but still only a few millimetres), blister-like lesions. This form of the illness is often accompanied by the typical symptoms—intense itching or &quot;pins and needles&quot; with a lack of sweating (anhidrosis) to affected areas. A small risk of heat exhaustion exists due to inability to sweat if the rash affects a large proportion of the body&#x27;s surface area or the patient continues to engage in heat-producing activity. Miliaria rubra is also known as prickly heat and heat rash. Differential diagnosis should be used to rule out polycythemia vera, which is a rare hematological disorder and appears more often in males than females, generally not before the age of 40. Both disorders share a common trait of appearing after taking a hot shower.

===Miliaria profunda===
The most severe form of miliaria, miliaria profunda, sometimes referred to as &quot;wildfire&quot; due to the rapid spread and severe burning sensations, generally occurs as a complication of repeated episodes of miliaria rubra. The obstruction is deep in the structure of the sweat gland, causing the gland&#x27;s secretions to leak between the superficial and deep layers of the skin. The rash and associated symptoms tend to appear within hours of an activity provoking sweating, but similarly fade within hours when the stimulus for the sweating is removed. Miliaria profunda is characterised by nonpruritic, flesh-coloured, deep-seated, whitish papules. The rash tends to be flesh-coloured as opposed to the prominent redness of miliaria rubra, and the risk of heat exhaustion is larger. Miliaria profunda is also less commonly known as &quot;mammillaria&quot; 

===Miliaria pustulosa===
Miliaria pustulosa describes pustules due to inflammation and bacterial infection. Miliaria pustulosa is preceded by another dermatitis that has produced injury, destruction, or blocking of the sweat ducts.

===Postmiliarial hypohidrosis===
Postmiliarial hypohidrosis is a skin condition that results from occlusion of sweat ducts and pores, and may be severe enough to impair an individual&#x27;s ability to perform sustained work in a hot environment.

===Tropical anhidrotic asthenia===
Tropical anhidrotic asthenia is a skin condition, a rare form of miliaria, with long-lasting poral occlusion, which produces anhidrosis and heat retention.

===Occlusion miliaria===
Occlusion miliaria is a skin condition that is accompanied by anhidrosis and increased heat-stress susceptibility, all after the application of extensive polyethylene film occlusion for 48 hours or longer.

===Colloid milium===
Colloid milium is a skin condition characterized by a translucent, flesh-colored, or slightly yellow, 1 to 5 mm papules.

==Pathophysiology==
Miliaria occurs when sweat glands become clogged due to dead skin cells or bacteria such as &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, a common bacterium that occurs on the skin, which is also associated with acne.

The trapped sweat leads to irritation (prickling), itching, and a rash of very small blisters, usually in a localized area of the skin.

==Prevention==
Prickly heat can be prevented by avoiding activities that induce sweating, using air conditioning to cool the environment, wearing light clothing, and in general, avoiding hot and humid weather. Frequent cool showers or cool baths with mild soap can help to prevent heat rash.

==Treatment==

The primary remedy for prickly heat or rash is to wear lighter clothing, or otherwise avoid overheating one&#x27;s body. The immediate treatment of the involved skin areas involves the use of a soothing ointment, such as calamine lotion.

Medical assistance should be sought for the first episode of a rash with the appearance of miliaria. The differential diagnosis includes several conditions that an experienced practitioner should be able to recognise and may require treatment distinct from the usual measures taken for miliaria. In most cases, the rash of miliaria resolves without intervention, but severe cases can last for weeks and cause significant disability. General measures should be recommended for all patients, including moving to an air-conditioned environment if possible, avoiding sweat-provoking activities and occlusive clothing, and taking frequent, cool showers.

The use of topical antibacterials (including antibacterial soaps) may shorten the duration of symptoms in miliaria rubra even in the absence of obvious superinfection. Other topical agents that may reduce the severity of symptoms include anti-itch preparations such as calamine or menthol- or camphor-based preparations, and topical steroid creams. Caution should be used, however, with oil-based preparations (ointments and oily creams as opposed to water-based or aqueous lotions) that may increase blockage of the sweat glands and prolong the duration of illness. Other agents have been investigated including supplemental vitamin A and C and vitamin A based medications, but little scientific evidence supports any of the above treatments in reducing the duration of symptoms or frequency of complications.

In most tropical areas, the local dispensaries sell prickly heat powder, a talc admixture containing drying milk proteins (labilin) and Triclosan to fight bacterial infection. These include cooling menthol to help alleviate difficulty getting to sleep. This is an effective treatment; the powder stays on the skin longer and treats bacteria dispersed into bed linens, providing a reasonably dry refuge area for healing. Miliaria often covers large areas, and generous use of cortisone may be contraindicated for reasons stated on package warnings. Regular talcum powder does not reduce the rash, but can alleviate burning and itching. In cases where the rash has developed into open blisters or pustular lesions, a doctor should be consulted since more aggressive, medically monitored treatment may be required.

<doc id="1214393" wikidata="Q7979319" url="?curid=1214393" title="Weeble">
<text>Weebles are a range of children&#x27;s roly-poly toys that was introduced in 1971 by the US toy company Hasbro and currently marketed under their Playskool brand. They are egg-shaped, so tipping one causes a weight located at the bottom-center to be raised. Once released, the Weeble is restored by gravity to an upright position. Weebles have been designed with a variety of shapes, including some designed to look like people or animals.

The catchphrase &quot;Weebles wobble, but they don&#x27;t fall down&quot; was used in advertising during their rise in popularity in the 1970s and during successive relaunches in the early 2000s. The line was coined by advertising executive J. Mitchell Reed in his Madison Ave Office.

In the United Kingdom, Weebles were manufactured and marketed by Airfix under licence from 1973 until Airfix&#x27;s collapse in 1981.

In 2023, PlayMonster acquired an international licence from Hasbro to manufacture and sell Weebles.

==Design principle==
Weeble is shaped like an egg—in order for the physics principles to work as intended, the shape must have a bottom which is a more or less smooth (unfaceted) (to allow the Weeble to roll) and from the central vertical axis the shape must be nearly cylindrically symmetrical (that is, any plane cut through the vertical axis line must produce close to the same profile). Next, the shape must be filled with two basic types of unmixed solids, and the volume of the lighter solid must be greater than that of the heavier solid. Next, the overall shape must have constant positive curvature. Next, the relationship between the heavy solid and the light solid must be such that any orientation of the object off of the vertical axis line must cause the object&#x27;s centroid to raise and to become offset. Lastly, the object must have only one position in which it can achieve stable mechanical equilibrium.

Combining these characteristics produces a basic Weeble. In theory, it is not possible to have a Weeble with a centroid that is too low to achieve a stable mechanical equilibrium.

== List of playsets ==
Numerous playsets were made and marketed in the US throughout the 1970s including a Haunted House, Treehouse, Tarzan, Camper, Playground, Marina, Circus, Fun House, Mickey Mouse Club Set, Mickey Mouse Magic Kingdom, Western Theme Set, Weekender and others. Playsets often came with certain figures, though these could also be purchased separately. 

The &quot;Weebles 1971–2011 Price Guide and Index&quot; lists and shows every Weeble model made over the preceding 40 years. There are 116 Weebles in total (83 regular; 21 peelable; 12 tumbling) including all egg-shaped sizes and variations made during 1971–1983. In 2011 Hasbro started making a new line of larger egg-shaped Weebles and had produced 42 new Weebles by July 2011. A wide range of accessories was available for the Weebles, including vehicles, buildings and furniture. Some sets had themes, such as the Weebles circus set.

There are 44 Weebles sets that include at least one Weebles figure and a vehicle, or larger sets made between 1972 and 1982.

A new line of Weebles was created in 2004 that were not egg-shaped but rather shaped like different animals. These were produced for a couple of years.

<text>The Short Films of David Lynch (2002) is a DVD collection of the early student and commissioned film work of American filmmaker David Lynch. As such, the collection does not include Lynch&#x27;s later short works, which are listed in the filmography.

The DVD contains introductions by Lynch to each film.

== &quot;Six Figures Getting Sick (Six Times)&quot; ==

&quot;Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)&quot; (1966). Originally untitled, &quot;Six Men Getting Sick&quot; is a one-minute color animated film that consists of six loops shown on a sculptured screen of three human-shaped figures (based on casts of Lynch&#x27;s own head as done by Jack Fisk) that intentionally distorted the film. Lynch&#x27;s animation depicted six people getting sick: their stomachs grew and their heads would catch fire.

Lynch made this film during his second year at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art. The school held an experimental painting and sculpture exhibit every year and Lynch entered his work in the Spring of 1966. The animated film was shown on &quot;an Erector-set rig on top of the projector so that it would take the finished film through the projector, way up to the ceiling and then back down, so the film would keep going continuously in a loop. And then I hung the sculptured screen and moved the projector back till just what I wanted was on the screen and the rest fell back far enough to disappear&quot; (Chris Rodley, editor of &quot;Lynch on Lynch&quot;). Lynch showed the whole thing with the sound of a siren as accompaniment. The film cost $200 and was not intended to have any successors. It was merely an experiment on Lynch&#x27;s part because he wanted to see his paintings move.

== &quot;The Alphabet&quot; ==

&quot;The Alphabet&quot; (1968) was made for the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and combines animation and live action and goes for four minutes. It has a simple narrative structure relating a symbolically rendered expression of a fear of learning.

The idea for &quot;The Alphabet&quot; came from Lynch&#x27;s wife, Peggy Lentz, a painter whose niece, according to Lynch in Chris Rodley&#x27;s &quot;Lynch on Lynch&quot; book, &quot;was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that&#x27;s sort of what started &quot;The Alphabet&quot; going.&quot; Based on the merits of this short film, Lynch was awarded an American Film Institute production.

In 2023, MovieWeb ranked &quot;The Alphabet&quot; as the 9th creepiest short horror film of all time, writing that the film captures &quot;Lynch&#x27;s unique talent for crafting an atmosphere of absolute dread&quot;.

== &quot;The Grandmother&quot; ==

&quot;The Grandmother&quot; (1970, 33 minutes). After the success of &quot;The Alphabet&quot;, one of Lynch&#x27;s friends, Bushnell Keeler, recommended that he check out the American Film Institute. Keeler&#x27;s brother-in-law had been involved in setting up the AFI. Lynch submitted &quot;The Alphabet&quot;, and wrote a script for a short film entitled &quot;The Grandmother&quot;. He sent the script and a print of &quot;The Alphabet&quot; to the AFI in Washington. Lynch got a call from George Stevens Jr. and Tony Vellani at the AFI, who wanted to know if Lynch could make &quot;The Grandmother&quot; for $5,000 (it eventually cost $7,200).

The short film combines live action and animation. The story revolves around a boy who grows a grandmother to escape neglect and abuse from his parents. It is mostly silent with only occasional vocal outbursts of gibberish and soundtrack cues used to convey story.

The music in the film was provided by a local group known as Tractor, and marked the first time Lynch would work with Alan Splet, who was recommended to the filmmaker by the soundman of &quot;The Alphabet&quot;. Initially, Lynch and Splet intended to use a collection of sound effects records for the film, but after going through them all they found that none of them were useful. So, Lynch and Splet took sixty-three days to make and record their own sound effects.

After finishing &quot;The Grandmother&quot;, Lynch took the film to be shown at the AFI in Washington, D.C. The head of the AFI at the time, George Stevens Jr. found that after all the films had been categorized, only Lynch&#x27;s defied easy categorization. Stevens and Vellani recommended that Lynch apply to the AFI&#x27;s Center for Advanced Film Studies. This was a filmmaking conservatory that Vellani had recently started in Beverly Hills. Lynch and Splet both applied for scholarships, and on the strength of &quot;The Grandmother&quot; (which won awards at film festivals in Atlanta, Bellevue and San Francisco), they were accepted into the program.

== &quot;The Amputee&quot; ==

&quot;The Amputee&quot; (1974) was made for the American Film Institute while &quot;Eraserhead&quot; was in financial limbo. The AFI was testing two different stocks of black and white video, and enlisted Frederick Elmes to test each one. Lynch asked Elmes if he could shoot something with this stock, and he allowed him, so Lynch and Catherine Coulson stayed up all night writing the script. The result was a one shot scene with Catherine Coulson about a woman attempting to write a letter while a nurse (played by Lynch) tends to her leg stumps. It exists in two versions: one that goes for 4 minutes and 50 seconds, and one that goes for 4 minutes and 4 seconds.

== &quot;The Cowboy and the Frenchman&quot; ==

&quot;The Cowboy and the Frenchman&quot; (1988, 26 minutes) is slapstick, made for French television as part of the series &quot;The French as Seen by...&quot; by French magazine &quot;Figaro&quot;. It stars Harry Dean Stanton, Frederic Golchan, Michael Horse, Tracey Walter, and Jack Nance.

== &quot;Premonitions Following an Evil Deed&quot; ==

&quot;Lumière: Premonitions Following an Evil Deed&quot; (1996, 52 seconds) was originally included as a segment in the 1995 film &quot;Lumière et compagnie&quot;. Forty acclaimed directors created works using the original Cinematographe invented by the Lumière brothers. In five shots, Lynch&#x27;s film depicts a woman having troubled thoughts as police discover a body.

<doc id="1214400" wikidata="Q744016" url="?curid=1214400" title="Konopiště">
<text>Konopiště Castle (; , ) is a four-winged, three-storey castle located in Konopiště, now a part of the town of Benešov in Central Bohemian Region, Czech Republic. It has become famous as the last residence of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, whose assassination in Sarajevo triggered World War I. The bullet that killed him, fired by Gavrilo Princip, is now an exhibit at the castle&#x27;s remote museum.

==History==

The castle was apparently established around 1294 by Prague Bishop Tobiáš of Benešov as a Gothic fortification in the style of a French castle with a rectangular plan and round towers protruding from the corners, making the most effective defence possible. Accounts show that the Benešovic family from nearby Benešov were the owners in 1318, and that in 1327 the castle passed into the hands of the Šternberks. In 1468, it was conquered by the troops of George of Poděbrady after a siege that lasted almost two years.

In 1603, the estate was purchased by Dorota Hodějovská of Hodějov, who made Renaissance alterations to the old gothic fortification. The Hodějovský family fortified their property because of their active participation in the Bohemian Revolt in 1620. Albrecht von Wallenstein acquired the castle, and after him it was passed to Adam Michna of Vacínov. Michna gained notoriety through his repression of the serfs, who revolted against him and conquered Konopiště in 1657.

The Swedes occupied and plundered Konopiště in 1648, and the Vrtba family then purchased the dilapidated structure. After 1725, they had it transformed into a Baroque style château. The drawbridge was replaced by a stone bridge, and near the east tower a new entrance was inserted in the wall. The gate which embellished it was designed by František Maxmilián Kaňka and featured statues from the workshop of Matthias Braun. In 1746, the upper levels of four of the towers were destroyed and one tower was completely demolished. During repair of the interiors, mythological and allegorical frescoes were painted on the ceilings of the great hall, and marble fireplaces with carved decorations by Lazar Wildmann were created.

Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria bought Konopiště in 1887 with his inheritance from the deposed Francis V, Duke of Modena. He had it repaired between 1889 and 1894 by the architect Josef Mocker into a luxurious residence, suitable for a future Emperor, which he preferred to his official residence, the Belvedere, Vienna. The extensive 225 ha (550-acre) English landscape garden with terraces, a rose garden and statues, was established at the same time.

He invited Wilhelm II, German Kaiser to see his roses early in June 1914. Insofar as they discussed politics, they discussed Romania, but undocumented conspiracy theories about their planning an attack on Serbia or a division of the Austro-Hungarian Empire arose at the time.
===State ownership===

The castle was seized in 1919 and its confiscation was ratified in 1921. Since then, the castle has been the property of the Czechoslovak and later Czech state, one of 90 such properties in state ownership. The Ministry of Culture was said to spend more than US$800,000 per year to maintain the castle, and it recovers about as much from entrance ticket sales and rental fees for occasional functions.

In 2000, Princess Sophie von Hohenberg, great-granddaughter of Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, filed a lawsuit seeking restitution of the castle to the Hohenberg family. The lawsuit, filed in Benešov, sought restitution of the castle, of woodland and a brewery. The series of lawsuits was still ongoing in 2013.

==Tourism==
Konopiště has been open to the public since 1971. Visitors can observe the residential rooms of Franz Ferdinand, who was also an enthusiastic hunter, a large collection of antlers, the &quot;Obizzi-Este collection&quot; (the third largest European collection of armoury and medieval weapons from Castello del Catajo, Padua, Italy), a shooting hall with moving targets, and a garden with Italian Renaissance statues and greenhouses.

==In popular culture==
Part of the film &quot;The Illusionist&quot; was filmed in Konopiště, the prince&#x27;s castle in the movie.

<doc id="1214401" wikidata="Q665315" url="?curid=1214401" title="Pudhumaipithan">
<text>C. Viruthachalam (25 April 1906 – 30 June 1948), better known by the pseudonym Pudhumaipithan (also spelt as Pudumaipithan or Puthumaippiththan), was one of the most influential and revolutionary writers of Tamil fiction. His works were characterized by social satire, progressive thinking and outspoken criticism of accepted conventions. Contemporary writers and critics found it difficult to accept his views and his works were received with extreme hostility. He as an individual and his works have been extensively reviewed and debated for over sixty years since his death. His influence has been accepted and appreciated by the present day writers and critics of Tamil fiction. In 2002, the Government of Tamil Nadu nationalised the works of Pudumaippithan.

==Life and career==
Pudhumaipithan was born in Thiruppadirippuliyur (Cuddalore district). His early education was obtained in places like Gingee, Kallakurichi and Tindivanam. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree from Tirunelveli Hindu college in 1931. In the same year he married Kamala and moved to Madras.

His career as a writer began in 1933 with an essay &quot;Gulabjaan Kaadhal&quot; (Love for Gulab jamun) published in the magazine &quot;Gandhi&quot;. His first short story &quot;&quot;Aatrangarai Pillaiyaar&quot; (Pillaiyaar on the river bank) was published in 1934 in &quot;Manikodi&quot;&quot; and from then on his short stories appeared regularly in it. His short stories appeared in a number of magazines like &quot;Kalaimakal&quot;, &quot;Jothi&quot;, &quot;Sudantira Chanku&quot;, &quot;Oozhiyan&quot; and &quot;Thamizh Mani&quot; and the annual issue of &quot;Dina Mani&quot;. He worked briefly as a sub editor at &quot;Oozhiyan&quot; and later at &quot;Dina Mani&quot;. In 1943, he left &quot;Dina Mani&quot; to join &quot;Dinasari&quot;. In 1940, his book &quot;Pudhumaipithan Kadhaigal&quot;(The stories of Pudhumaipithan), an anthology of his short stories was published. He slowly ventured into the world of Tamil cinema and worked as a scriptwriter in the films &quot;Avvaiyaar&quot; and &quot;KaamaValli&quot;. In 1945, he started &quot;Parvatha Kumari Productions&quot; and made an abortive attempt at producing a film called &quot;&quot;Vasanthavalli&quot;. While working for the movie &quot;Raja Mukthi&quot;&quot;, in Pune he contracted tuberculosis. He died on 5 May 1948 in Thiruvananthapuram.

==Works and themes==

Pudumaippithan&#x27;s active writing period was less than 15 years (1934–46) in which he wrote nearly 100 short stories, an equal number of essays on a variety of subjects, 15 poems, a few plays and scores of book reviews. His writings gave him a reputation as a maverick. His works were influenced by the French short story writer Guy de Maupassant among others. The subjects he wrote on and the characters he chose to portray were completely new to Tamil fiction. He felt that Tamil literature had been crippled by unspoken conventions and openly criticized those who adhered to them. In one of his essays he expressed his displeasure as:

He was unfazed by the hostile reception that his works received from contemporary writers and critics alike. Dismissing his critics, he wrote :

To voice his views he used a wide range of characters, both common – husbands wives, students, children, rickshaw pullers, villagers, beggars, whores, oppressed people, saints, revolutionaries; and uncommon – God, ghosts, monsters, hospital beds. Some of his favourite themes were – conflicts between emotion and reason, Hindu religion – its rules, rituals and laws, caste system, struggles for survival and oppression of women in the Indian society.

===Short stories===

Pudumaipithan is primarily known for his short stories. Of the 108 stories that have been identified as works of Pudumaipithan, only 48 had been published in book form during his lifetime. Most of his works were published in magazines like &quot;Manikodi&quot;, &quot;Kalaimagal&quot;, &quot;Jothi&quot;, &quot;Sudantira Chanku&quot;, &quot;Oozhiyan&quot;, &quot;Thamizh Mani&quot;, &quot;Dina mani&quot;, &quot;Dina Sari&quot; and &quot;Nandan&quot;. The rest have been published posthumously in various anthologies, the latest one being in 2000. He belonged to the &quot;Manikodi&quot; movement (named for the magazine) which flourished in 1930s. Ku. Paa Rajakoopaalan, B. S. Ramaiya and Va. Ramasamy were his contemporaries in the &quot;Manikodi&quot; movement.

===Translations===
He was also a prolific translator of literary works from other languages into Tamil. He translated around 50 short stories, including the works of Molière, Kay Boyle, Maxim Gorky, Sinclair Lewis, Ernst Toller, William Shakespeare, E. M. Delafield, William Saroyan, E. V. Lucas, Moshe Smilansky, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bret Harte, John Galsworthy, Aleksandr Kuprin, Anton Chekhov, Franz Kafka, Ilya Ehrenburg, Guy de Maupassant, Valery Bryusov, Anatole France, Leonid Andreyev, Henrik Ibsen, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Murray Gilchrist, Frances Bellerby, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Leonard Strong, Jack London, Peter Egge, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov, Thomas Wolfe and James Hanley. He had strong views on doing translations and adaptations. He equated adaptations to literary theft and held the view that translation was the proper way to bring literary works of other languages to Tamil. In 1937, he was involved in a literary feud with Kalki Krishnamurthy on the issue of translations vs adaptations

===Poems===
Pudumaipithan wrote about fifteen poems in total. His first published poem was &quot;Thiru Angila arasanga thondaradipodi azhwar vaibhavam&quot;, which appeared in 1934. Most of his poems were written as letters to his friend T. M. Chidambara Ragunathan in the form of &quot;Venpas&quot;. The fifteen poems were published posthumously in 1954. Like his short stories, his poems are full of wit and satire. The most famous of his poems is the abusive limerick &quot;Moonavarunasalamae&quot; written in review of a book on Tamil prose, which failed to mention the &quot;Manikodi&quot; movement.

===Political books===
Pudumaipithan&#x27;s political orientation was socialist. Among his political essays and books, four are considered important – &quot;Fascist Jatamuni&quot; (a biography of Benito Mussolini), &quot;Gapchip Durbar&quot; (a biography of Adolf Hitler), &quot;Stalinukku Theriyum&quot; and &quot;Adhikaram yarukku&quot; (both endorsing communism and policies of Joseph Stalin). All the four books contain scathing indictments of fascism and a general agreement with Stalinist policies.

==Writing style==

Pudhumaipithan was the first Tamil writer to successfully use a dialect of Tamil other than that of Chennai or Tanjore. Most of his characters spoke the Tirunelveli dialect. His stories were set either in Madras or in Tirunelveli, the two places where he spent considerable portions of his life. His writing style had a mixture of colloquial and classical words. Gentle satire even while handling complicated and serious situations was his hallmark. He used harsh language while arguing with his literary opponents like Kalki Krishnamoorthy and wrote insulting limericks in his book reviews.

==Plagiarism and other criticisms==
Pudumaippithan has been accused by some of his contemporaries and later critics of having plagiarized from the works of Maupassant. Chief among the accusers were his contemporaries Pe. Ko. Sundararajan (Chitty) and So. Sivapathasundaram and literary critic Kaarai Krishnamoorthy. Pudumaipitthan himself published the short story &quot;Tamil Paditha Pondaati&quot; (The wife who knew Tamil) with the foreword that it was based on Maupassant&#x27;s work. Pudumaipithan&#x27;s biographer T.M. Chidambara Ragunathan has identified the stories &quot;samadhi&quot;, &quot;Nondi&quot;, &quot;Bayam&quot;, &quot;Kolaikaran kai&quot;, &quot;Nalla velaikaran&quot; and &quot;Andha muttal venu&quot; as adaptations of Maupassant&#x27;s works and the story &quot;Pithukuli&quot; as the adaptation of a Robert Browning poem. A few more stories like &quot;Doctor Sampath&quot;, &quot;Naane Kondren&quot;, &quot;Yaar Kurravali&quot; and &quot;Thekkangandrugal&quot; have also been tentatively identified as possible adaptations. His defenders (including Ragunathan and historian A R Venkatachalapathy) have argued that those were adaptations and not plagiarizations. Pudumaipithan did not publish the short stories which have been identified (except &quot;Tamil Paditha Pondaati&quot;) as adaptations when he was alive. They were published posthumously only after 1953. Thus, the defenders infer he would have acknowledged them as adaptations if he had published them himself (as he did in the case of &quot;Tamil Paditha Pondaati&quot;). Further they contend Pudhumaipithan did not know French and during his lifetime the other Maupassant stories he has been accused of plagiarizing had not been translated into English. In their view, Pudumaipithan has had to suffer the accusation of plagiarism due to the callousness of his posthumous publishers. All of Pudhumaipithan&#x27;s adaptations were written before 1937, when he became involved in a literary feud with Kalki Krishnamurthy about adapting works from other languages. During the feud he wrote biting essays equating adaptations with literary theft.

He has been criticized for just raising uncomfortable issues and not proposing any solutions for them. He had responded by pointing out that his job was only raising the issue and leaving the reader to figure out the solution. There have also been minor criticisms regarding his writing style like his digressing from the plot due to elaborate descriptions of environment and characters. Recently, Tamil critic A. Marx has criticised Pudumaipithan&#x27;s portrayal of Dalits, Christians, Maravars and meat eaters as derogatory.

==Pseudonyms==
Pudhumaipithan wrote under different pseudonyms, but the name &quot;Pudhumaipithan&quot; was the one that became famous. He himself preferred the name as he felt that this name was partially responsible for the appeal of his stories. Some of his other pseudonyms were &quot;So.Vi&quot;, &quot;Rasamattam&quot;, &quot;Mathru&quot;, &quot;Koothan&quot;, &quot;Nandhan&quot;, &quot;Oozhiyan&quot;, &quot;Kabhali&quot;, &quot;Sukraachari&quot; and &quot;Iraval visirimadippu&quot;. For publishing poems he used the pseudonym &quot;Velur Ve. Kandasamy Pillai&quot;. Due to the accusation of plagiarism his pseudonyms have been extensively researched. T.M. Chidambara Ragunathan in his pudhumaipithan biography &quot;Pudumaippithan kathaigal: sila vimarsanangalum vishamangalum&quot;, has advanced the theory that all the works published under the name of &quot;Nandhan&quot; are adaptive works rather than original ones.

<text>Dame Gillian Karawe Whitehead (born 23 April 1941) is a New Zealand composer. She is of Māori Ngāi Te Rangi descent. Her Māori heritage has been an important influence on her composing.

== Early life ==
Whitehead was born in Hamilton in 1941. The daughter of Ivan and Marjorie Whitehead, she is of Ngāi Te Rangi descent. Her father was a music teacher and conductor of the Waipu Choral Society and her mother played the piano. She began composing early, making clear to her mother at age 17 that she wanted to be a composer.

== Education ==
She studied at the University of Auckland from 1959 to 1962, and Victoria University of Wellington in 1963, graduating BMus(Hons) in 1964. She then studied composition at the University of Sydney with Peter Sculthorpe from 1964–65, graduating MMus in 1966. That same year she attended a composition course given by Peter Maxwell Davies and in 1967 travelled to England to continue studying with him.

==Career==
Whitehead worked in London composing and copying music for two years and then with the assistance of a New Zealand Arts Council grant worked in Portugal and Italy from 1969 to 1970. For the next seven years she continued freelance composing, principally based in the United Kingdom. From 1978 to 1980, she held an English academic post, having been during that time Composer in Residence for Northern Arts attached to Newcastle University.

In 1981, she returned to New South Wales, to join the staff of the Composition School at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. She was Head of Composition for four years. She left the Conservatorium in 1996. Since then she has spent most of her time in New Zealand, mostly in Dunedin.

In 1989 she was Composer in Residence at Victoria University of Wellington. She took up the Mozart Fellowship at the University of Otago in 1992. During 2000 and 2001 she was Composer in Residence at the Auckland Philharmonia. Her major orchestral work, &quot;The Improbable Ordered Dance&quot;, written during the Residency won the 2001 SOUNZ Contemporary Award.

From 1998 to 2003 she was president of the Composers Association of New Zealand. In 2005–2006 she was the Composer in Residence at the New Zealand School of Music at Victoria University. She was the first Composer in Residence to stay at the Lilburn Residence.

In 2009 Whitehead was one of the 2009 Henderson Arts Trust artists-in-residence in Alexandra.

== Compositions ==
Whitehead has written a wide range of music including works for solo, chamber, choral, orchestral and operatic forces, most of them direct commissions from performers and funding organisations. A number of her works have been recorded for commercial release, including a CD of her chamber works by Wai-te-ata Music Press and a recording of her opera, &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;.

&quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1998) was commissioned by the Otago Commemorative Opera Group, Te Atamira Whakamaumahara to mark 150 years since the founding of the city of Dunedin and Otago province. Another opera, &quot;The Art of Pizza&quot; (1995), was commissioned by Chamber Mode, a Melbourne opera group. Set in a Sydney shopping mall it looks at the situation of refugees.

The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra commissioned Whitehead to write a piece to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook&#x27;s arrival in New Zealand; she produced &quot;Turanga-nui&quot; (2018), referring to the name of Gisborne and Cook&#x27;s landfall there.

In 2020 she wrote a piece especially for the baroque ensemble Juilliard451 from the Juilliard School of Music in New York who toured New Zealand.

=== Influence of Māori heritage and instruments ===
Since her time in London Whitehead has used Māori themes in her work. &quot;Pakuru&quot; (1967), for baritone and ensemble, is based on Māori sayings and the seasonal cycle. She began to incorporate taonga pūoro (traditional Māori instruments) in her work in the 1990s after meeting Hirini Melbourne and Richard Nunns. Her Lilburn Lecture in 2019 examined how she uses the sounds of taonga pūoro. Other works with Māori themes include &quot;Ahotu (ō matenga)&quot; (1984), &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1998), &quot;Hineraukatauri&quot; (1999) and &quot;Hine-pu-te-hue&quot; (2001).

=== Use of magic squares ===
Whitehead has used magic squares in her composition, also used by Peter Maxwell Davies and others. She first read about them in the 1970s and used them for the next 20 years. In the 1980s when she moved to Sydney she used squares but much more freely and later pieces combined prime numbers and squares in a more integrated way. Squares remained as the starting point of her composing but later she moved to compose more instinctively. She acknowledged the process of using a systematic approach, its potential and then moving away from it.
==Honours and awards==
In the 1999 New Year Honours, Whitehead was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music. She has received two awards from the Arts Foundation: an Arts Foundation Laureate in 2000 and an Arts Foundation Icon in 2018. Victoria University of Wellington awarded her an honorary DMus in 2003. In 2007 she received the Composers Association KBB/CANZ Citation for Services to Music. In the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she was promoted to Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, also for services to music. In 2009, following the reinstatement of titular honours by the New Zealand government, Whitehead accepted redesignation as a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

<text>Charles Michael Adler (born October 2, 1956) is an American voice actor and voice director. He is known for his roles as Buster Bunny on &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, the Bigheads on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, Ickis on &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, Doctor Doom, Wrecker, Sabertooth and others in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot;, MODOK in various Marvel media, Cobra Commander in &quot;GI Joe: Resolute&quot; and &quot;Renegades&quot;, Starscream in the &quot;Transformers&quot; film series, Mr. Whiskers of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers&quot;, the titular characters of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; along with its main antagonist, The Red Guy, Professor Monkey-for-a-Head in &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, I.R. Baboon in &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;, T-Bone in &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot; and Tex Hex in &quot;Bravestarr&quot;.

==Early life==
In the mid-1960s, Adler&#x27;s family moved to Nanuet, New York and later to Massachusetts. He was given the nickname &quot;Beanie&quot; due to always wearing a Beanie cap. His sister Cheryl Adler is a psychotherapist who wrote the book &quot;Sober University&quot;.

Growing up, Adler was a self-described &quot;TV junkie&quot;, and an avid fan of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; and Irene Ryan&#x27;s Granny Moses from &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

==Career==
Adler&#x27;s first professional acting job was in a commercial in 1971. Afterward, he took a hiatus from acting. During this time, he worked a variety of jobs, including waiter, janitor, paper delivery man, floor stripper, house painter, remedial reading teacher and caretaker for an Episcopal church.

In 1984 and 1985, he starred as Arnold Beckoff in &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, for which he was nominated for the 1985 Helen Hayes Best Actor Award, in New York City before moving to California in 1986.

Adler&#x27;s first animation role was recorded in New York City, voicing Spike in &quot;Rescue at Midnight Castle&quot;.

In 1985, after convincing the head of the Abrams, Rubiloff and Lawrence agency to allow him to audition for their voice-over department, Adler later attended a private audition for Ginny McSwain and Arlene Thornton. An agent had praised him in front of them as the &quot;next Frank Welker&quot;. McSwain recalls that &quot;he blew their minds&quot; but he claims that initially they had no interest in him. Having no demo, they arranged for him to record an audition. He improvised characters during the tape, which impressed both McSwain and Thornton; however, Adler was so embarrassed with his performance that he performed with his back to them and his face hidden with a hat and sunglasses.

His voice acting career took off when Adler landed the roles of Nat Smurfling in the fourth season of &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;&quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper&quot; on &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot;, Silverbolt on &quot;The Transformers&quot; and Eric Raymond, Techrat and Zipper in &quot;Jem&quot;.

He was disenchanted with live-action acting after working on &quot;The Redd Foxx Show&quot;, in which he portrayed Ralph/Rita. In an interview for The Magic Behind the Voices, Adler commented on the experience: &quot;you spend your whole life going, &quot;God, I just want to be in a TV show and have a parking space&quot;. Then I got it and it was just so not what I wanted to do.&quot;

He became active in animation, his roles include reprising Spike on &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, Low-Light on &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, Mr. O&#x27;Greasy on &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, Deputy Fuzz and Tex Hex on &quot;Bravestarr&quot;, Cavey Jr. on &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot;, Pinky Dalton on &quot;The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound&quot;, Quark and Zappy on &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Judy Jetson&quot;, the TurkeyBoy and sometimes Hamburglar in McDonald&#x27;s commercials and The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald, Mad Dog, Hacksaw, and Howard Huge in &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, Dripple on &quot;Tom and Jerry Kids&quot;, and the titular character on &quot;Paddington Bear&quot;.

In 1990, Adler lent his voice to Buster Bunny on &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;. Producer Tom Ruegger recalled that he and voice director Andrea Romano insisted Steven Spielberg cast him due to the &quot;great deal of energy&quot; he brought to Buster. In 1992, during the show&#x27;s third season, he abruptly left the show after a disagreement with the producers; while voice actors with smaller roles in the show were given starring roles in its successor &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, he was offended when he was not offered a role in that series. John Kassir replaced him for the remainder of &quot;Tiny Toons&quot;.

In 1993, Adler went on to play Chance &quot;T-Bone&quot; Furlong on &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot;, Bill on &quot;The Terrible Thunderlizards&quot;, Ickis on &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, Ed and Bev Bighead on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, Stalker Slaughter on &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; and Screwball Squirrel, as well as reprising Dripple for &quot;Droopy, Master Detective&quot;.

In 1995, Adler voiced several characters on &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;. In the latter, he played Cow, Chicken and The Red Guy. &quot;No Smoking&quot; was a pilot created by David Feiss, which was greenlit to be a series in 1997 with him on board to reprise his characters, for a new series, titled &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;. &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; ran from 1997 to 1999, receiving multiple awards and nominations, including an Annie Award for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production&quot; for Adler as Cow. Later on &quot;I Am Weasel&quot; was made into a spinoff series, in which he reprised the three characters and also voice I.R. Baboon.

His voice directing career began in the late 1990s with &quot;Rugrats&quot; and later collaborated with Klasky Csupo. Adler has directed &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, &quot;Rocket Power&quot;, &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack&quot;, &quot;The Replacements&quot;, among others.

In 2002, Adler, with David Feiss and Michael Ryan, directed his own short film &quot;No Prom for Cindy&quot;.

Adler also voiced Dr. Peacock in Froot Loops commercials, Padrig Winks and Mr. Hornsby on &quot;Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks&quot;, SAVO on &quot;Danger Rangers&quot;, Mr. Whiskers on &quot;Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers&quot;, Optimatus on &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; and Doctor Doom on &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot;.

In 2007, Adler provided the voice of Starscream in Michael Bay&#x27;s live-action &quot;Transformers&quot; film franchise. Just as Chris Latta voiced both Starscream and Cobra Commander in the Sunbow cartoons, Adler voiced Cobra Commander on &quot;G.I. Joe: Resolute&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe: Renegades&quot;. He also voiced the titular character in the webtoon &quot;Inspector Beaver&quot;.

Adler was the guest of honor at the 2017 edition of AnthroCon.

His subsequent credits as voice director include Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Blaze and the Monster Machines&quot;, &quot;Wabbit&quot; (season 1), &quot;Kulipari: An Army of Frogs&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny&quot;. He also plays MODOK on &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;.

<text>Ponui Island (also known as Chamberlin&#x27;s Island) is a privately owned island located in the Hauraki Gulf, to the east of the city of Auckland, New Zealand. It is located to the southeast of Waiheke Island, at the eastern end of the Tamaki Strait, which separates the island from the Hunua Ranges on the mainland to the south.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;long night&quot; for &quot;Pōnui&quot;. The island is the site of some of the earliest archaeological remains of early Māori in the Auckland region, dating to at least the 1400s.

The island has an area of 18 km2 and has been farmed by the Chamberlin family since 1853. The island now consists of three farms, two owned by the Chamberlin family and one by John Spencer. The only permanent inhabitants (nine in the 2001 census) are associated with the farms which are predominantly used for sheep. From the 1880s until the early 20th century, stone and sand from the island was extracted for use in concrete structures in Auckland.
The island is a popular site for youth camps for organisations such as Scouts. Crusader camps (now under the banner of Scripture Union) have been held on the island since 1932.

The island is the home of New Zealand&#x27;s only feral donkey breed, the Ponui donkey. It also has a large population of kiwi.

<doc id="1214416" wikidata="Q4584" url="?curid=1214416" title="Malagasy ariary">
<text>The ariary (sign: Ar; ISO 4217 code MGA) is the currency of Madagascar. It is notionally subdivided into 5 &quot;iraimbilanja&quot; and is one of only two non-decimal currencies currently circulating (the other is the &quot;Mauritanian ouguiya&quot;). The names ariary and iraimbilanja derive from the pre-colonial currency, with ariary (from the Spanish word &quot;real&quot;) being the name for a silver dollar. Iraimbilanja means literally &quot;one iron weight&quot; and was the name of an old coin worth of an ariary. However, as of May 2023, the unit is effectively obsolete since the iraimbilanja has practically no purchasing power, and the coins have fallen into disuse.

==History==
The ariary was introduced in 1961. It was equal to 5 Malagasy francs. Coins and banknotes were issued denominated in both francs and ariary, with the sub-unit of the ariary, the &quot;iraimbilanja&quot;, worth of an ariary and therefore equal to the franc. The ariary replaced the franc as the official currency of Madagascar on 1 January 2005.

Coins and banknotes were denominated in both the official francs and the semi-official ariary and iraimbilanja since 1961. On early issues, the franc denomination was the most prominent. However, from 1978, higher value coins were issued denominated only in ariary. In 1993, new 500 ariary-2500 franc note and 5000 ariary-25,000 franc were issued with ariary slightly more prominent. On banknotes issued since 31 July 2003, the ariary denomination is displayed prominently and the franc denomination in small print. Lower denomination coins are also now issued denominated in ariary but with the main design unchanged.

==Coins==
In 1965, 1 franc (1 iraimbilanja) and 2 francs (venty sy kirobo) coins were issued, followed by 5 francs (1 ariary) in 1966 and 10 and 20 francs (2 and 4 ariary) in 1970. The term &quot;venty sy kirobo&quot; derives from names used in the 19th century for and of a silver dollar or 5 francs piece, since += of 5 francs is approximately 2 francs.

In 1978, 10 and 20 ariary coins were issued which did not show the denomination in francs. These were followed in 1992 by 5 and 50 ariary coins as well as smaller 10 and 20 ariary. In 2003–04, 1 and 2 ariary coins not bearing the franc denomination were also introduced.

Coins in circulation are listed below. Bold denotes the most prominent denomination, while italic denotes an equivalence that is not shown on the coin.
==Banknotes==
In 1961, the Institut d&#x27;Émission Malgache (Malagasy Issuing Institute) introduced banknotes in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 francs. These notes were overprints on earlier notes of the Bank of Madagascar and Comoros, with the denomination in ariary (10, 20, 100, 200 and 1000) included in the overprint. Regular banknotes in the same denominations followed between 1963 and 1969. The denomination in ariary was written only in words, not numerals.

On 12 June 1973, the Banky Foiben’ny Repoblika Malagasy (Central Bank of the Malagasy Republic) was created by Ordinance No. 73-025, taking over the functions of the Institut d’Émission Malgache, including the issuance of banknotes. In 1974 new notes were issued in the same denominations as had been used earlier.

In December 1975, a draft constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, and the Second Malagasy Republic, to be called the Repoblica Demokratika Malagasy (Democratic Republic of Madagascar), was proclaimed. As a result of the change in the country&#x27;s name, the former Banky Foiben’ny Repoblika Malagasy was renamed Banky Foiben’i Madagasikara (Central Bank of Madagascar). resulting in a new series of notes which included 10,000 francs (2000 ariary) notes but did not include 50 or 100 francs.

In 1993, notes for 500 ariary and 5000 ariary were introduced which bore the ariary denominations in numerals as well as the franc denominations (2500 and 25,000) in smaller numerals. However, in 1998, these notes were replaced by new issues which only gave the franc denominations in numerals.

In 2003–2004, new notes were introduced in denominations of 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10,000 ariary. These notes also bear the franc denominations on notes up to 1000 ariary (500, 1000, 2500, 5000) in very small numerals.

In 2017, the Bank Foiben’i Madagasikara (Central Bank of Madagascar) introduced a new family of banknotes. The new series of notes, like its previous series, remains &quot;Madagascar and its Riches&quot;, highlighting its economic activities, biodiversity, culture and tourist sites. Part of this series includes a new denomination, 20,000 ariary. The first four denominations in this series, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 ariary were issued on 17 July 2017. The four other denominations, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 ariary, were issued on 17 September 2017.

Banknotes currently in circulation are listed below.

<text>Kensington is a suburb in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is located four kilometres south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area (LGA) of the City of Randwick. 

Kensington lies to the immediate south of Moore Park and west of Randwick Racecourse. The principal landmarks of the suburb are the main campus of the University of New South Wales, National Institute of Dramatic Art and the Australian Golf Club. Kensington is also a residential suburb close to the Sydney central business district.

==History==

=== Indigenous inhabitants ===
Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by the Cadigal people, one of the salt-water clans of the Darug language group. The Cadigal people were known for their fishing skills and often travelled in canoes. The 1828 census showed some 50–60 clans of Cadigal people living by the Lachlan swamps of Kensington and surrounding areas. Swamps provided fruit, nectar, roots and tubers. Very few Aboriginals live in Kensington today.

===European settlement===
The suburb now known as Kensington was once called the &quot;Lachlan Mills Estate&quot;, &quot;Stannumville&quot; and then &quot;Epsom&quot;. It became Kensington in the late 1880s, starting life as an industrial suburb. Samuel Terry, the convict who became Australia&#x27;s first millionaire, received a land grant in 1819. Daniel Cooper (1785–1853), also an ex-convict acquired land here in 1825 with his partner Solomon Levey, whom he later bought out. Cooper&#x27;s nephew Daniel (1821–1902) planned to subdivide but in 1865 all developments was forbidden. Residential land was issued in the late 1880s and Kensington was to be the equivalent of London&#x27;s distinguished suburb, Kensington.

Kensington Racecourse opened in 1893 on the site of the current University of New South Wales. It did not compete with nearby Randwick Racecourse because it held midweek meetings, pony racing and related sports like polo. The course was also used to house troops and horses during the Boer War, World War I and World War II. Many of the first Anzacs trained at Kensington Racecourse in 1914 before leaving for Egypt and Gallipoli. It was a migrant hostel during the late 1940s. The land was resumed in 1950 to construct Sydney&#x27;s second university.


The WD &amp; HO Wills tobacco factory opened in Todman Avenue in 1902. The factory site also featured the Raleigh Park Social Club, an extensive sporting complex named after Sir Walter Raleigh who first introduced tobacco from North America to Europe. The factory closed in 1989 and was slowly converted into a residential neighbourhood by the Mirvac Group and Westfield in a joint venture known as Raleigh Park. The building used by the company is a two-storey brick building in the Georgian Revival style. It was designed by Joseland and Gilling and built c.1930. It was used by the Menzies Group of Companies as of 2013. It is heritage-listed.

Kensington&#x27;s streets are named after local people, places in London and local flora. Some examples are:
*Balfour Lane – named after Arthur James Balfour, the first earl of Balfour, a British statesman and Prime Minister (1902–1905)
*Doncaster Avenue – named after Doncaster Racecourse in England
*Boronia Street – &quot;Boronia&quot; is a flowering shrub grown extensively in the area.

===Sacred Heart Monastery===

The hill that dominates West Kensington is occupied by the Sacred Heart Monastery, the Australian headquarters of the Catholic Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. The monastery was designed by Sheerin &amp; Hennessy and built in 1895. It is a large stone building in the Gothic style and features an attic storey and a prominent central tower. It also includes a brick chapel in a Romanesque-Byzantine style which was designed by Mullane and built in 1939, and which is joined to the monastery by a matching brick cloister. The monastery is a prominent landmark which can be seen from various parts of Kensington and is now listed on the Register of the National Estate. In the mid-twentieth century, the monastery was the home of the anti-Communist organiser Dr P.J. (&#x27;Paddy&#x27;) Ryan, the popular Catholic controversialist Dr Leslie Rumble, the former athlete Jim Carlton, the retired missionary Francis Xavier Gsell and the editor Fr Paul Stenhouse. The monastery published the long-running magazine &quot;Annals Australasia&quot;.

Adjacent to the monastery is the Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Convent, a brick building in Federation Gothic style, which was built in 1897. It was the original site for primary and secondary colleges that were established soon after the construction of the convent, but these soon outgrew the premises. It is now the base for OLSH Provincial House and St Joseph&#x27;s Aged Care Facility, while Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College is situated next door. Across the road is Our Lady of the Rosary Church (built 1906), Jubilee Hall and the Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School, which complete a large religious complex. The convent and church are heritage-listed.

===Tram history===

The line from Surry Hills to West Kensington commenced as a steam powered system in 1881. At this point the line travelled along Crown Street as far as Cleveland Street. The line was then extended to Phillip Street in 1909, Todman Avenue in 1912, and then to its final terminus down Todman Avenue, West Kensington in 1937.

The line commencing from the city branched off from the tramlines in Oxford Street and ran down Crown Street to Cleveland Street in Surry Hills, then south along Baptist Street to Phillip Street, where it swung left into Crescent Street before running south along Dowling Street, tuning left into Todman Avenue where it terminated. Services operated full-time from Circular Quay, and to Railway Square in peak hours. The line down Crown Street closed in 1957, the remainder stayed open until 1961 to allow access to Dowling St Depot, (the current site of the Supa Centa Moore Park – Shopping Centre).

As well as servicing West Kensington, tram services also operated on Anzac Parade, servicing the Maroubra and La Perouse line.

Tay Park (bounded by Tay Street, Anzac Parade and Alison Road) is the site of the old Toll Bar where local maintenance revenue was collected from 1854 to 1894. The toll was 1 shilling for a four-wheeled wagon drawn by 2 horses.

==Commercial area==
Kensington is heavily influenced by the University of New South Wales and the racing industry. It has a handful of cafes, restaurants and shops. Kensington has a shopping strip that extends most of the length of Anzac Parade and further south into Kingsford. Peters of Kensington is a well known retail store on Anzac Parade. Kensington is next to Randwick Racecourse and Centennial Park.

==Transport==
Anzac Parade is the main road through Kensington. Numerous buses frequently service Kensington, linking it with the city and surrounding suburbs. A proposed extension of the Eastern Suburbs railway line to Kingsford was abandoned in 1976.

In April 2020, the CBD and South East Light Rail from Circular Quay opened.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Kensington is located in the geographic zone known as the Botany Lowlands. The sands beneath Kensington act as a large water reservoir. Originally, Kensington was quite rugged, consisting of hills, deep gullies and 768 acres (3.1 km²) of swamps, crossed by the Lachlan Stream. Evidence of the swamps can be seen in the south-west corner of the Royal Randwick Racecourse and the ponds of Centennial Park. After long periods of heavy rain some parts of Kensington are prone to flooding. Today Kensington has been levelled with hills cut down and voids filled with the excess soil from the hills. 

===Parks, flora and fauna===

In the three square kilometres that cover Kensington, there are six parks. Banksia, Bottlebrush, Waratah, Wattles and Eucalypt are some of the approximately four hundred native plants found in Kensington. Randwick City Council has recorded approximately two hundred and fifty species of indigenous native vertebrates. Two hundred and six species of native birds have been identified since 1788. The largest park, Kensington Park, covers approximately 2.8 hectares and attracts a wide variety of birdlife, including galahs, crows, ibises and magpies.

Parks:
* Fitzpatrick Park, Day Avenue
* Ingram Street Reserve, Ingram Street
* Kokoda Park, Goodwood Street
* Raleigh Park, Brompton Road
* Wills Reserve, Duke Street
* Kensington Park, Edward Avenue

<doc id="1214419" wikidata="Q909899" url="?curid=1214419" title="Peter Woulfe">
<text>Peter Woulfe (1727–1803) was an Anglo-Irish chemist and mineralogist. He first had the idea that wolframite might contain a previously undiscovered element (tungsten).

In 1771, Woulfe reported the formation of a yellow dye when indigo was treated with nitric acid. 

Later it was discovered by others that he had formed picric acid, which eventually was used as the first synthetic dye, an explosive and an antiseptic treatment for burns.

Woulfe is credited with inventing, around 1767, the , an apparatus for purifying or dissolving gases, which employed a bottle with two or three necks.

== Alchemy ==
Woulfe has been described as being as much an alchemist and mystic as a scientist. As recorded by John Timbs:

&quot;The last true believer in alchemy was not Dr. Price, but Peter Woulfe, the eminent chemist, and Fellow of the Royal Society, and who made experiments to show the nature of mosaic gold [ tin(IV) sulfide, SnS2]. […] He had long vainly searched for the Elixir, and attributed his repeated failures to the want of due preparation by pious and charitable acts. I understand that some of his apparatus is still extant, upon which are supplications for success and for the welfare of the adepts.&quot;

<doc id="1214420" wikidata="Q2348740" url="?curid=1214420" title="Death of Azaria Chamberlain">
<text>Azaria Chantel Loren Chamberlain (11 June 1980, Mount Isa – 17 August 1980, Uluru) was a two-month-old Australian baby girl who was killed by a dingo on the night of 17 August 1980 during a family camping trip to Uluru in the Northern Territory. Her body was never found. Her parents, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a dingo. However, Lindy was tried for murder and spent more than three years in prison. Michael received a suspended sentence. Lindy was released only after Azaria&#x27;s jacket was found near a dingo lair and new inquests were opened. In 2012, 32 years after Azaria&#x27;s death, the Chamberlains&#x27; version of events was officially supported by a coroner.

An initial inquest held in Alice Springs in the supreme court supported the parents&#x27; claim and was highly critical of the police investigation. The findings of the inquest were broadcast live on television—a first in Australia. Subsequently, after a further investigation and a second inquest held in Darwin, Lindy was tried for murder, convicted on 29 October 1982 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Azaria&#x27;s father, Michael, was convicted as an accessory after the fact (&quot;i.e.&quot; aiding the principal after the crime has been committed, but playing no role in the crime itself) and given a suspended sentence. The media focus for the trial was unusually intense and aroused accusations of sensationalism, while the trial itself was criticised for being unprofessional and biased. The Chamberlains made several unsuccessful appeals, including the final High Court appeal.

After all legal options had been exhausted, the chance discovery in 1986 of Azaria&#x27;s jacket in an area with numerous dingo lairs led to Lindy&#x27;s release from prison. On 15 September 1988, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously overturned all convictions against Lindy and Michael. A third inquest was conducted in 1995, which resulted in an &quot;open&quot; finding. At a fourth inquest held on 12 June 2012, Coroner Elizabeth Morris delivered her findings that Azaria Chamberlain had been taken and killed by a dingo. After being released, Lindy was paid $1.3 million for false imprisonment and an amended death certificate was issued.

Numerous books have been written about the case, and there exist several pop culture references notably using some form of the phrase &quot;A dingo ate my baby&quot; or &quot;A dingo took my baby&quot;. The story has been made into a television movie, a feature film entitled &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (released outside Australia and New Zealand as &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot;), a television mini-series, a theatrical production, a concept album by Australian band The Paradise Motel, and an opera (&quot;Lindy&quot;, by Moya Henderson).

==Coroner&#x27;s inquests==
The initial coronial inquest into the disappearance was opened in Alice Springs on 15 December 1980 before magistrate Denis Barritt. On 20 February 1981, in the first live telecast of Australian court proceedings, Barritt ruled that the likely cause was a dingo attack. In addition to this finding, Barritt also concluded that, subsequent to the attack, &quot;the body of Azaria was taken from the possession of the dingo, and disposed of by an unknown method, by a person or persons, name unknown&quot;.

The Northern Territory Police and prosecutors were dissatisfied with this finding. Investigations continued, leading to a second inquest in Darwin in September 1981. Based on ultraviolet photographs of Azaria&#x27;s jumpsuit, James Cameron of the London Hospital Medical College alleged that &quot;there was an incised wound around the neck of the jumpsuit—in other words, a cut throat&quot; and that there was an imprint of the hand of a small adult on the jumpsuit, visible in the photographs. Their Yellow Holden Torana was also seized in Queensland and flown by military aircraft to Alice Springs. Following this and other findings, the Chamberlains were charged with Azaria&#x27;s murder.

In 1995, a third inquest was conducted which failed to determine a cause of death, resulting in an &quot;open&quot; finding.

==Case against Lindy Chamberlain==

The Crown alleged that Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria&#x27;s throat in the front seat of the family car, hiding the baby&#x27;s body in a large camera case. She then, according to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, before going to the tent and raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from the campsite were searching, she disposed of the body.

The key evidence supporting this allegation was the jumpsuit, discovered about a week after the baby&#x27;s disappearance about 4 km from the tent, bloodstained about the neck, as well as a highly contentious forensic report claiming to have found evidence of foetal haemoglobin in stains on the front seat of the Chamberlains&#x27; 1977 Holden Torana hatchback. Foetal haemoglobin is present in infants six months and younger; Azaria was nine-and-a-half weeks old at the time of her disappearance.

Lindy Chamberlain was questioned about the garments that Azaria was wearing. She claimed that Azaria was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but the jacket was not present when the garments were found. She was questioned about the fact that Azaria&#x27;s singlet, which was inside the jumpsuit, was inside out. She insisted that she never put a singlet on her babies inside out and that she was most particular about this. The statement conflicted with the state of the garments when they were collected as evidence. The garments had been arranged by the investigating officer for a photograph.

In her defence, eyewitness evidence was presented of dingoes having been seen in the area on the evening of 17 August 1980. All witnesses claimed to believe the Chamberlains&#x27; story. One witness, a nurse, also reported having heard a baby&#x27;s cry after the time when the prosecution alleged Azaria had been murdered. Evidence was also presented that adult blood also passed the test used for foetal haemoglobin, and that other organic compounds can produce similar results on that particular test, including mucus from the nose and chocolate milkshakes, both of which had been present in the vehicle where Azaria was allegedly murdered.

Engineer Les Harris, who had conducted dingo research for over a decade, said that, contrary to Cameron&#x27;s findings, a dingo&#x27;s carnassial teeth can shear through material as tough as motor vehicle seat belts. He also cited an example of a captive female dingo removing a bundle of meat from its wrapping paper and leaving the paper intact.

The defence&#x27;s case was rejected by the jury. Lindy Chamberlain was convicted of murder on 29 October 1982 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Michael Chamberlain was found guilty as an accessory after the fact and was given an 18-month suspended sentence.

===Appeals===
An unsuccessful appeal was made to the Federal Court in April 1983. Subsequently, the High Court of Australia was asked to quash the convictions on the ground that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. However, in February 1984 the court refused the appeal by majority (3-2).

==Release and acquittal==

The final resolution of the case was triggered by a chance discovery. In early 1986, British tourist David Brett fell to his death from Uluru during an evening climb. Because of the vast size of the rock and the scrubby nature of the surrounding terrain, it was eight days before Brett&#x27;s remains were discovered, lying below the bluff where he had lost his footing and in an area full of dingo lairs. As police searched the area, looking for missing bones that might have been carried off by dingoes, they discovered Azaria&#x27;s missing matinee jacket.

The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory ordered Lindy Chamberlain&#x27;s immediate release and the case was reopened. On 15 September 1988, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously overturned all convictions against Lindy and Michael Chamberlain.

The questionable nature of the forensic evidence in the Chamberlain trial, and the weight given to it, raised concerns about such procedures and about expert testimony in criminal cases. The prosecution had successfully argued that the pivotal haemoglobin tests indicated the presence of foetal haemoglobin in the Chamberlains&#x27; car and it was a significant factor in the original conviction. But it was later shown that these tests were highly unreliable and that similar tests, conducted on a &quot;sound deadener&quot; sprayed on during the manufacture of the car, had yielded virtually identical results.

Two years after they were exonerated, the Chamberlains were awarded $1.3 million in compensation for wrongful imprisonment, a sum that covered less than one third of their legal expenses.

The findings of the third coroner&#x27;s inquest were released on 13 December 1995; the coroner found &quot;the cause and manner of death as unknown.&quot;

In December 2011, Elizabeth Morris, then one of the Northern Territory coroners, announced that a fourth inquest would be held in February 2012, which was to be done &quot;largely in relation to information provided by [the Chamberlains&#x27;] counsel about dingo attacks since the death of Azaria&quot; as part of a campaign by the Chamberlains for a new inquest to establish that Azaria had been taken by a dingo. On 12 June 2012, at a fourth coronial inquest into the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain, Morris ruled that a dingo was responsible for her death in 1980. Morris made the finding in the light of subsequent reports of dingo attacks on humans causing injury and even death. She stated, &quot;Azaria Chamberlain died at Ayers Rock on 17 August 1980. The cause of her death was as a result of being attacked and taken by a dingo.&quot; She subsequently offered her condolences to the parents and siblings of Azaria Chamberlain &quot;on the death of [their] special and dearly loved daughter and sister&quot;, and stated that a new death certificate with the cause of death had been registered.

==Media involvement and bias==
The Chamberlain trial was highly publicised. Given that most of the evidence presented in the case against Lindy Chamberlain was later rejected, the case is now used as an example of trial by media, wherein media coverage and bias can adversely affect a trial.

Public and media opinion during the trial was polarised, with &quot;fanciful rumours and sickening jokes&quot; and many cartoons. In particular, antagonism was directed towards Lindy Chamberlain for reportedly not behaving like a stereotype of what would be expected from a grieving mother. Much was made of the Chamberlains&#x27; Seventh-day Adventist religion, including allegations that the church was actually a cult that killed infants as part of bizarre religious ceremonies.

One anonymous tip was received from a man, claiming to be Azaria&#x27;s doctor in Mount Isa, that the name &quot;Azaria&quot; meant &quot;sacrifice in the wilderness&quot; (it actually means &quot;Helped by God&quot;). In addition to being subject of a figurative witch-hunt, some claimed she was literally a witch.

It was reported that Lindy Chamberlain dressed her baby in a black dress. This provoked negative opinion.

==Subsequent events==
Since the Chamberlain case, proven cases of attacks on humans by dingoes have been discussed in the public domain, in particular dingo attacks on K&#x27;gari (off the Queensland coast), the last refuge in Australia for isolated pure-bred wild dingoes. In the wake of these attacks, it emerged that there had been at least 400 documented dingo attacks on K&#x27;gari. Most were against children, but at least two were on adults. For example, in April 1998, a 13-month-old girl was attacked by a dingo and dragged for about one metre (3 ft) from a picnic blanket at the Waddy Point camping area. The child was dropped when her father intervened.

In July 2004, Frank Cole, a Melbourne pensioner, claimed that he had shot a dingo in 1980 and found a baby in its mouth. After interviewing Cole on the matter, police decided not to reopen the case. He claimed to have the ribbons from the jacket which Azaria had been wearing when she disappeared as proof of his involvement. However, Lindy Chamberlain claimed that the jacket had no ribbons on it. Cole&#x27;s credibility was further damaged when it was revealed he had made unsubstantiated claims about another case.

In August 2005, a 25-year-old woman named Erin Horsburgh claimed that she was Azaria Chamberlain, but her claims were rejected by the authorities and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; programme, which stated that none of the reports linking Horsburgh to the Chamberlain case had any substance.

==Later events==
Michael Chamberlain died of leukemia on 9 January 2017, aged 72.

The National Museum of Australia has in its collection more than 250 items related to the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain, which Lindy Chamberlain has helped document. Items include courtroom sketches by artists Jo Darbyshire and Veronica O&#x27;Leary, camping equipment, the Chamberlain family&#x27;s car, outfits worn by Lindy Chamberlain, the number from her prison door, and the black dress worn by Azaria. The National Library of Australia has a small collection of items relating to Azaria, such as her birth records, as well as a manuscript collection which includes around 20,000 documents including some of the Chamberlain family&#x27;s correspondence and a large number of letters from the general public. Later the actual car itself was sold to the museum by Michael Chamberlain.

==Media and cultural impact==
===Movies and TV===

The death of Azaria Chamberlain has been the subject of several books, films and television shows, and other publications and accounts. The John Bryson book &quot;Evil Angels&quot; was published in 1985, and subsequently adapted by Australian film director Fred Schepisi into a 1988 feature film of the same name (released as &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot; outside of Australia and New Zealand), starring Meryl Streep as Lindy Chamberlain and Sam Neill as Michael. The film gave Streep her eighth Academy Award nomination and her first AFI Award.

In 2002, &quot;Lindy&quot;, an opera by Moya Henderson, was produced by Opera Australia at the Sydney Opera House.

The story was dramatised as a television miniseries, &quot;Through My Eyes&quot; (2004), with Miranda Otto and Craig McLachlan as the Chamberlains. This miniseries was based on Lindy&#x27;s book of the same name.

===Podcast===
The death of Azaria and the story of the search, inquests, trial and eventual exoneration of the Chamberlains was documented in a commercial podcast, &quot;A Perfect Storm: The True Story of the Chamberlains&quot;. The case was also covered by the &quot;Casefile&quot; podcast, episode 136, the debunking podcast &quot;You&#x27;re Wrong About,&quot; the &quot;Killer Queens&quot; podcast, episode 180, and the crime podcast &quot;International Infamy with Ashley Flowers.&quot; This case was also covered in a 2024 episode of “The Red Thread”.

===Popular culture references===
The event was transmuted from tragedy to morbid comedy material for US television series such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &#x27;became deeply embedded in American pop culture&#x27; with phrases such as &#x27;a dingo&#x27;s got my baby!&#x27; serving as &#x27;a punchline you probably remember hearing before you knew exactly what a dingo was&#x27;. Lindy Chamberlain&#x27;s release from jail is a significant event in episode three of &quot;The Newsreader&quot;. In the 1998 animated film &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, a reporter makes a reference to this case by saying, &quot;Is it true a dingo ate your baby?&quot;. Australian puppet-comedian Randy Feltface also referenced the event in his 2021 live show &quot;Purple Privilege&quot;, where he claimed he was &quot;...born on the day Lindy Chamberlain&#x27;s baby was eaten by a dingo.&quot;

===Theatrical production===
Playwright Alana Valentine conceived a production in 2013, featuring criticism and outrage towards Lindy Chamberlain surrounding the events and aftermath of the death of Azaria. The production continues a decade later; in 2023 amateur theatre company Milton Follies starred Ashley Howes as Lindy.

<doc id="1214422" wikidata="Q3424246" url="?curid=1214422" title="Japan–United Kingdom relations">
<text>are the bilateral relations between Japan and the United Kingdom.

== History ==
The history of the relationship between Japan and England began in 1600 with the arrival of William Adams (Adams the Pilot, &quot;Miura Anjin&quot;), the first of very few non-Japanese samurai, on the shores of Kyushu at Usuki in present-day Ōita Prefecture. During the Sakoku period (1641–1853), there were no formal relations between the two countries, while the Dutch acted as intermediaries.

Formal diplomatic ties began with the treaty of 1854, which eventually led to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. This alliance marked the end of Britain&#x27;s &#x27;splendid isolation&#x27; since 1815, while, for Japan, it brought much-needed British support ahead of the looming Russo-Japanese War. Japan&#x27;s victory over Russia solidified the alliance, which lasted for two decades. However, American pressure and the subsequent Four-Power Treaty of 1921 brought it to an end.

Relations deteriorated rapidly during the 1930s due to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and the cutoff of oil supplies in 1941 further escalated tensions. Japan declared war in December 1941 and, with overwhelming force, seized most British possessions east of India, including Hong Kong, British Borneo (with its vital oil reserves), Malaya, Singapore, and Burma. However, the British began pushing Japanese forces back after they reached the outskirts of India.

Relations improved in the 1950s–1970s and, as memories of the conflict faded, grew increasingly warm. In the 1970s, Emperor Hirohito and Queen Elizabeth II paid state visits to each other’s countries. Today, the United Kingdom and Japan have strong economic ties, with both being members of the G7 and the CPTPP. The two nations are also collaborating in the field of defence, most notably through the GCAP programme, the joint development of the next-generation fighter jet alongside Italy.

They are the first known Japanese men to have set foot in the British Isles.
*1593. Richard Hawkins leaves England on board the Dainty in a bid to discover the &#x27;Iſlands of Japan&#x27; via the Magellan Strait in 1594, the very route William Adams would take himself in 1599.

He also became one of the first English samurai.
*1605. John Davis, the famous English explorer, was killed by Japanese pirates off the coast of Thailand, thus becoming the first known Englishman to be killed by a Japanese.

*1613. Following an invitation from William Adams in Japan, the English captain John Saris arrived at Hirado Island in the ship &quot;Clove&quot; with the intent of establishing a trading factory. Adams and Saris travelled to Suruga Province where they met with Tokugawa Ieyasu at his principal residence in September before moving on to Edo where they met Ieyasu&#x27;s son Hidetada. During that meeting, Hidetada gave Saris two varnished suits of armour for King James I, today housed in the Tower of London. On their way back, they visited Tokugawa once more, who conferred trading privileges on the English through a Red Seal permit giving them &quot;free licence to abide, buy, sell and barter&quot; in Japan. The English party headed back to Hirado Island on 9 October 1613. However, during the ten-year activity of the company between 1613 and 1623, apart from the first ship (&quot;Clove&quot; in 1613), only three other English ships brought cargoes directly from London to Japan.

*1673. An English ship named &quot;Returner&quot; visited Nagasaki harbour with factors from the first Hirado factory, and asked for a renewal of trading relations. But the Edo shogunate refused after Dutch prompting. The government cited the withdrawal 50 years earlier, and found it unacceptable that the English king had married the Portuguese Catherine of Braganza, claiming the English to favour the Roman Catholic Church.

<text>Calvin Leon Graham (April 3, 1930 – November 6, 1992) was the youngest U.S. serviceman to serve and fight during World War II and was one of the few known child soldiers to fight on behalf of the United States in the conflict. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Navy from Houston, Texas on August 15, 1942, at the age of 12. His case was similar to that of Jack W. Hill, who was granted significant media attention due to holding service number one million during World War II, but later was discovered to have lied about his age and subsequently discharged.

== Early life ==
Graham was born in Canton, Texas, and was attending elementary school in Houston before he decided to join the Navy, after his father had died and his mother had remarried.

== US Navy, World War II ==
Graham enlisted in the Navy on August 15, 1942. He went through boot camp in San Diego, California for six weeks. He was deployed to the USS &quot;South Dakota&quot;, at Pearl Harbor in Oahu, Hawaii.

=== USS &quot;South Dakota&quot; ===
On October 26, 1942, he saw action in the Battle of the Santa Cruz. The &quot;South Dakota&quot; and her crew received a Navy Unit Commendation for their service. On the night of November 14–15, 1942, Graham was wounded during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. He served as a loader for a 40 mm anti-aircraft gun and was hit by shrapnel while taking a hand message to an officer. Though he received fragmentation wounds, he helped in rescue duty by aiding and pulling the wounded aboard ship to safety. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart, and he and his crew mates were awarded another Navy Unit Commendation.

The &quot;South Dakota&quot; returned to the East Coast on December 18, 1942, for an overhaul and battle damage repairs (she had taken 42 hits from at least three enemy ships) in New York City, and since then, was named &quot;Battleship X&quot; in order to make the Japanese think she had been sunk. Graham&#x27;s mother revealed his age after he traveled to his grandmother&#x27;s funeral in Texas (he arrived a day late) without permission from the Navy, for which he spent three months in a Texas brig. He was released after his sister threatened to contact the newspapers. Although he had tried to return to his ship, he was discharged from the Navy on April 1, 1943, and his awards were revoked. The &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s gunnery officer who was involved in handling his case was Sargent Shriver.

He then worked in a Houston shipyard as a welder after dropping out of school. At age 14 he married and became a father the following year. At age 17 he was divorced when he enlisted in the Marine Corps.

== US Marine Corps, 1948–1951 ==
Graham joined the United States Marine Corps in 1948 at age 17. His enlistment in the Marines also ended early when he fell from a pier and broke his back in 1951 during the Korean War. Although serving in the Marine Corps qualified him as a veteran, he would spend the rest of his life fighting for full medical benefits and clearing his military service record.

==Post military service==
In 1978, Graham was finally given an honorable discharge for his service in the Navy, and after writing to Congress and with the approval of President Jimmy Carter, all medals except his Purple Heart were reinstated. His story came to public attention in 1988, when his story was told in the TV movie, &quot;Too Young the Hero&quot; starring Rick Schroder.

In 1988, Graham received disability benefits and back pay for his service in the Navy after President Ronald Reagan signed legislation that granted Graham full disability benefits, increased his back pay to $4,917 and allowed him $18,000 for past medical bills, contingent on receipts for the medical services. By this time, some of the doctors who treated him had died and many medical bills were lost. He received only $2,100 of the possible $18,000. While the money for the rights to his story for the movie, &quot;Too Young The Hero&quot; amounted to $50,000, 50% went to two agents and 20% went to a writer of an unpublished book about Graham. He and his wife received just $15,000 before taxes.

=== Death ===
Graham&#x27;s Purple Heart was finally reinstated, and presented to his widow, Mary, on June 21, 1994, by Secretary of the Navy John Dalton in Arlington, Texas, nearly two years after his death from heart failure. He was buried at Laurel Land Memorial Park in Fort Worth, Texas.

==Military awards==

<text>Peter Brown (1837 – 10 September 1894) was a Swedish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Brown was approximately 42 years old, and a Trooper in the Cape Mounted Riflemen, Cape Colonial Forces during the Morosi&#x27;s Mountain 1879 Campaign when, on 8 April 1879 during the assault on Morosi&#x27;s Mountain, South Africa, Trooper Brown spent all day carrying water to his wounded comrades who were lying under rocks where they had taken shelter. He did this within 200 yards of the enemy who were firing from redoubts up the sides of the mountain and he was severely wounded during the day, his forearm was shattered and he was also hit in the leg. Nevertheless, he did not cease his efforts until his water bottle was shot through and became useless.

The published citation read:

==Death==
He died at his home in Cape Town from Bright&#x27;s disease.

<text>Double Bay is a harbourside eastern suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 4 kilometres east of the Sydney central business district. It is the administrative centre of the local government area of the Municipality of Woollahra.

Double Bay takes its name from the bay of Sydney Harbour and refers to the two geographical formations between Point Piper and Darling Point, which are interrupted by a miniature point in between. The eastern part is also known as Blackburn Cove. It has some of the most expensive real-estate in Australia and is colloquially often referred to as &quot;Double Pay&quot;, a term coined due to the high income of people living there, and the nature of the shopping area which features high-end fashion labels.

== History ==
Double Bay developed soon after initial European settlement in 1788. In the early years of the colony, Double Bay was used as shelter for fishermen who would regularly fish around the harbour. Farming mostly cattle and lettuce a farm had developed and by 1814 it had increased to envelop the valleys leading into Woollahra, Bondi Junction, Bellevue Hill, and Point Piper.

Charles Amos Messenger became the sculling champion of Victoria on 1 July 1878, Rowing Champion of New Zealand in 1881, and a contender for the sculling championship of the world in 1887. Charles Amos also established the first boatshed on Sydney Harbour at Balmain, from where it was later transferred by flotation to Double Bay. The early life of Double Bay revolved around the Messenger boatshed.

Charles Amos was the father of rugby league and rugby union player Dally Messenger, and Wally Messenger, who also played Rugby League for Australia. From their boatshed the Messenger brothers would row people across Sydney Harbour, including William Bede Dalley, the acting premier of New South Wales in 1885, who owned a castle in Manly.

<doc id="1214433" wikidata="Q5249403" url="?curid=1214433" title="Declarant">
<text>A declarant, generally speaking, is anyone who composes and signs a statement or alleging that the information he has given therein is true. This differs from an &quot;affiant,&quot; as in the case of an affidavit the facts therein are sworn to before a notary public or other official, whereas a declaration is usually made by one person for the use of another.

Uttering a statement or declaration which is proven to be false is a crime in many jurisdictions, though usually a separate offence from perjury.

The word declarant, when discussing the hearsay rule and its exceptions, refers to the person who makes an out-of-court statement. For example, if John is on the witness stand and says &quot;Mary said that she was afraid.&quot; Mary is the declarant, not John. This concept is important in understanding many applications of the hearsay rule and its exceptions.

<text>Walter Ernest Brown, (3 July 1885 – 28 February 1942) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth forces. He was born in Tasmania and worked as a grocer before enlisting in the Australian Army in 1915, following the outbreak of First World War. Initially he was sent to Egypt where he served in the Australian Service Corps before being transferred to the Western Front where he served in the infantry with the 20th Battalion. In July 1918, during the fighting at Villers-Bretonneux he single-handedly destroyed a German machine-gun post, taking a number of prisoners in the process. For this act he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was also later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for a previous act of bravery.

Following the war, Brown was repatriated to Australia and returned to civilian life. When the Second World War began, he lied about his age and previous experience in order to re-enlist in the Second Australian Imperial Force, this time serving in the Royal Australian Artillery. In 1942 Brown&#x27;s unit, the 2/15th Field Regiment, participated in the Malayan campaign following the Japanese invasion of Malaya, and retreated to Singapore. The garrison at Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942. Brown is believed to have been killed subsequently, with his date of death given as 28 February 1942, although his body has never been recovered.

==Early life==
Walter Ernest Brown was born on 3 July 1885 in New Norfolk, Tasmania. His parents were Sidney Francis Brown—a miller—and Agnes Mary Brown (née Carney). After finishing his schooling, he worked as a grocer in Hobart until 1911, when he moved to Petersham, New South Wales, where he remained in the same line of work until the First World War broke out.

==First World War==
Brown enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in July 1915 and was initially assigned to the 1st Australian Light Horse Regiment, before being transferred to the Imperial Camel Corps in Egypt. After being transferred to France he was assigned to the 55th Battalion, Australian Infantry; 1st and 2nd Field Butcheries, Australian Service Corps; and then, finally, the 20th Battalion, 5th Brigade, 2nd Division.

He managed to secure his transfer to the infantry by claiming that he had lost his false teeth, which meant that he had to be removed from the theatre and returned to Egypt, where he was able to attach himself to the infantry reinforcements that were being concentrated there prior to being sent to France to join the 20th Battalion.

His transfer to the 20th Battalion took place in July 1917 and he joined them while they were stationed in the line around St Omer. During September and October 1917, Brown took part in the fighting around Passchendaele and it was for his actions during this time that he was later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. On 19 October he was promoted to lance corporal. In November he was wounded, however, he returned to his unit shortly after and on 7 April 1918 he was promoted to the rank of corporal.

On 6 July 1918 at Villers-Bretonneux, France he performed the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross: Brown had rushed a machine-gun post armed with a hand grenade, taking one officer and 11 men prisoner under heavy machine-gun fire. After this incident Brown remained at the front until the end of the war, and despite being wounded again in August he was promoted to sergeant on 13 September 1918.

Following the war he was repatriated to Australia in late 1919 before being discharged on medical grounds in February 1920.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The award of the Victoria Cross to Brown was published in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 17 August 1918, reading:

==Inter war years==
After being discharged from the AIF in early 1920, Brown went to live in Sydney. During this time he undertook a number of different lines of work, being employed as a brass-finisher up until 1930 when he moved to Leeton and taking up a position as a water-bailiff in the New South Wales Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission. He remained in this job until he rejoined the Army in 1940.

On 4 June 1932 Brown married Maude Dillon at Christ Church in Bexley. The couple had two children, a boy and a girl.

==Second World War==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Brown enlisted as a gunner under his real name in the 2/15th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery in June 1940. Hoping to avoid attention and wanting to secure a posting to the front lines, he declared that he had &quot;no previous military experience&quot; and also claimed he had been born in 1900 in order to meet the age requirements for front line service. Although his identity became public knowledge, the military authorities allowed him to continue serving. He was briefly promoted to lance-sergeant, but requested to revert to the rank of gunner. His unit was sent to Malaya in August 1941 where they were attached to the 27th Brigade, and then to Singapore in February 1942 when it was invaded.

On 15 February 1942, Brown&#x27;s regiment moved up to the front line to make a final stand. Sources disagree as to what happened to Brown after this. When the order to surrender came, some witnesses alleged him to have calmly picked up some grenades and said: &quot;No surrender for me&quot;, before walking towards the enemy lines, never to be seen again.

Author John Moremon, however, suggests, from records held at the Australian War Memorial, that Brown sought to escape and after gaining permission from his commanding officer, led a group of 2/15th men to Rengat, in Sumatra, in a rowing boat. From there it is believed that Brown and the others attempted to link up with other troops that were being evacuated via bus, but they became separated and although some managed to get away to Padang, Brown is believed to have been killed while waiting for transport.

Although his date of death is uncertain, it has been presumed that Brown was killed some time after he went missing, and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission officially records his date of death as 28 February 1942. As his body was never found, Brown has no known grave, although he is commemorated at the Singapore Memorial at Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore.

==Medals==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.



Brown&#x27;s service in World War II resulted in the posthumous award of five further service medals, these being the 1939–1945 Star, Pacific Star, Defence Medal (United Kingdom), War Medal 1939–1945, and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945.

<text>Stevenson University is a private university in Baltimore County, Maryland with two campuses, one in Stevenson and one in Owings Mills. The university enrolls approximately 3,615 undergraduate and graduate students. Formerly known as Villa Julie College, the name was changed to Stevenson University in 2008.

==History==

===Founding===
Stevenson University was founded in Maryland as Villa Julie College in 1947 by the Roman Catholic women&#x27;s religious order Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur as a one-year school training women to become medical secretaries. The college was named for Saint Julie Billiart, foundress of the Sisters of Notre Dame.

Stevenson&#x27;s Greenspring Valley campus is in the Green Spring Valley area within northwestern portion of Baltimore County. It is located on the former estate of the George Carroll Jenkins family. The estate&#x27;s name was &quot;Seven Oaks&quot;, a reference to huge old oak trees planted on the property. They were thought to mark a traditional Lenni Lenape burial ground. One of these seven oaks still survived on campus until August 2007, when it was deemed potentially hazardous and cut down.

===Accreditation and expansion (1950s–1990s)===
Villa Julie was approved as a two-year college by the Maryland State Department of Education in 1954 and received its first Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation in 1962. In 1967, the college established a board of trustees and became independent of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur and the Roman Catholic Church. Villa Julie became coeducational in 1972, admitting its first male student that year.

Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs were added in 1984, starting with degrees in computer information systems and paralegal studies.

Traditionally a commuter college for local residents, by the early 1990s Villa Julie started attracting students interested in college housing. Without the proper zoning for such an addition to the Stevenson campus, the college leased off-campus apartments in Pikesville and later in the county seat of Towson, where resident students began living in 1993. Villa Julie was granted admission to the National Collegiate Athletic Association and its NCAA Division III in 1994.

It started offering master&#x27;s degrees in 1995. A major 1997 campus expansion more than doubled the amount of instructional space on campus, including expanded athletic facilities.

===Continued growth===
On October 28, 2000, Villa Julie College inaugurated its fourth president Kevin J. Manning, who succeeded Carolyn Manuszak. Under Manning, enrollment continued to increase and the demand for college-owned student housing intensified. The college broke ground on a second campus in Owings Mills in August 2003, opening it a year later. The Owings Mills campus included several major residence complexes.
In 2006 Rockland Center, a new student union and dining hall, was completed. The Caves Sports and Wellness Center also opened that same year.

===Stevenson University (2007–present)===

In late 2007, the school&#x27;s leaders decided to make changes needed to attain university status. Meetings were held to help determine whether the name should be changed to Villa Julie University, or something different, given its broader reach. Other names considered were Great Oaks University, Tufton University, Greenspring University, Rockland University, Sagamore University, and Billiart University. On June 11, 2008, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted to name the school Stevenson University: it referred to the original location of Villa Julie College and Robert Stevenson, a prominent Baltimore grain merchant who married Deborah Owings, the granddaughter of the founder of Owings Mills.

Today, Stevenson University is composed of seven schools. The Howard S. Brown School of Business and Leadership opened for the fall 2008 semester and houses the school&#x27;s Accounting, Business Administration, Business Information Systems, Computer Information Systems, Marketing, and Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics programs. Formerly housed on the Greenspring campus, the School of Design moved to a new building on a property purchased from Shire Pharmaceuticals in 2013 to create what is now the Owings Mills North location of the Owings Mills campus. In September 2016, the Kevin J. Manning Academic Center opened and today houses the Beverly K. Fine School of the Sciences, the Sandra R. Berman School of Nursing and Health Professions, and additional facilities for the School of Design. Facilities in Garrison Hall on the Owings Mills campus serve as the headquarters for Stevenson University Online, the university&#x27;s online school for working professionals seeking master&#x27;s degrees or to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The School of Humanities and Social Sciences and School of Education remains on the Greenspring campus.
On July 3, 2017, Stevenson University&#x27;s sixth president, Elliot Hirshman, joined the university after serving as president of San Diego State University since 2011 and previously as provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

The university expanded its athletic facilities in 2010 with the opening of a gymnasium and the 3,500-seat Mustang Stadium on the Owings Mills Campus. In summer 2017, Stevenson University reached an agreement with the state of Maryland to acquire the former Rosewood Center property in Owings Mills. The 117-acre site is adjacent to Stevenson&#x27;s existing Owings Mills campus and nearly doubles the total acreage of the university. The Rosewood project has included remediation and demolition of 20 buildings on the site in spring 2018. Grading of the site began in summer 2018.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate programs===
Stevenson offers over 90 majors, minors, tracks, and concentrations. All degree programs have a core curriculum in the liberal arts and a career emphasis. In 2018, the university introduced five professional minors—Applied Management, Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development, Human Resources, Real Estate, and Software Design and Coding—designed to pair with students’ majors to give them additional career options and a competitive edge in the job market. The school reported that 92 percent of graduates were employed or started graduate school within six months of graduation.

Traditional undergraduate students can also complete a master&#x27;s degree program through the university&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s to master&#x27;s option, designed to allow completion of both degrees in five years.

===Leadership, Service, and Honors Scholars programs===
Stevenson offers Leadership, Service, and Honors Scholars programs for students who wish to engage in leadership education, extend their civic engagement with the community, or partake in rigorous academic opportunities.

===Online programs===
Stevenson University Online, formerly the School of Graduate and Professional Studies, offers online master&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, and certificate programs for working professionals. Admission is granted on a rolling basis, and courses are offered year-round in 8-week sessions. Areas of study include nursing and healthcare; forensics, cyber forensics, law, and criminal justice; business &amp; technology management and business communications; community-based education and leadership; and STEM-focused teaching.

===Enrollment===
Stevenson University enrolls approximately 3,600 undergraduate and graduate students in more than 40 bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs. Stevenson&#x27;s total enrollment has more than doubled since 2001.

==Student life==
===Residence life and activities===
The freshman enrollment and housing enrollments rose dramatically between 2009–2010 and 2010–2011. In the fall semester 2010, there were over 900 freshman students, around 700 of whom were residents. In 2013, nearly 2,000 students lived in 13 residence halls on the Owings Mills campus.

In February 2018, Stevenson opened a Student Activities Commons in Garrison Hall on the Owings Mills campus to serve as a student club and activities center. The Commons include club sports offices, three meeting rooms, a fitness center, and a console video gaming room. It also serves as the home for Stevenson&#x27;s esports team, which has its own esports arena. In fall 2018, a reading room and the university&#x27;s fourth fitness center were also opened in Garrison Hall.

From community services and the arts to education and religion, there are more than 80 clubs and extracurricular activities for students. Mustang Activities and Programming (MAP) hosts over 40 student events a year, popular events include: Homecoming, Founders Day Talent Show, Rockland Blowout, and Food Truck Rally.

===Athletics===
The university&#x27;s athletic facilities include the Caves Sports and Wellness Center (formerly the training facility of the Baltimore Colts), the Owings Mills gymnasium, and Mustang Stadium. In 2017, purchase of the Rosewood property has been further developed into what is now known as East Campus. The newest campus features spaces for field hockey, soccer, baseball, softball, and track and field.

Stevenson teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Mustangs are a member of the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC). Stevenson used to compete in the Capital Athletic Conference(now the Coast-to-Coast Conference [C2C]) from 2007–08 to 2011–12. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and swimming. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor), volleyball (indoor and beach), and swimming. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey compete in the United Collegiate Hockey Conference.

In 2016, Stevenson University became the first NCAA Division III Institution to add Women&#x27;s Beach Volleyball as a collegiate sport. This is also the same year men&#x27;s ice hockey began their first season of competition. In Spring of 2022, Stevenson broadened their sport count to 28 with the addition of Acrobatics &amp; Tumbling, a competitive sport with similarities to cheer, gymnastics, and stunt. In September of that same year, Stevenson began their first season of competition for their 29th sport, Men&#x27;s Beach Volleyball, hosting the USA Volleyball Men&#x27;s Beach Collegiate Challenge tournament for the first time that year.

In 2013, the Stevenson Mustangs men&#x27;s lacrosse team took home the 2013 Division III national championship, the first national championship of any kind for the school. They advanced to the finals after defeating their rival Salisbury University. Overall, as of Fall 2018, Stevenson has won 39 conference championships.

=== Greek life ===
In Spring 2018, the university invited two national fraternities, Phi Mu Delta and Phi Beta Sigma, to colonize on campus. The university has three sororities, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Phi Mu and Phi Sigma Sigma.

===Marching band===
With the induction of the football team in 2011, the university added a marching band. The Stevenson University Marching 100 is a modern-style marching band that plays both contemporary and traditional marching band music. The band uses woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments along with synthesizers, guitars, and color guard. The band plays at football games, open houses, and other university events. It is directed by Mark Lortz.

==Arts and culture==
Since 2006, Stevenson University has sponsored the Baltimore Speakers Series, which takes place at the Joseph Meyerhoff Center in Baltimore City. Speakers have included former President Bill Clinton, electronics engineer Steve Wozniak, former FBI director James Comey, television journalist Tom Brokaw, Monty Python actor John Cleese, former First Lady Laura Bush, author and radio personality Garrison Keillor, and author/historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.

Through its Arts Alive! initiative, the university offers a year-round calendar of cultural programs, including art exhibitions, theatre productions, film screenings, musical performances, and guest speakers. Arts Alive is a way for students, faculty and staff, and members of the art community to showcase their work.
