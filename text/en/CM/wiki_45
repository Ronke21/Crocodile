<text>Below is a list of railroads that were bought, leased, or in other ways had their track come under ownership or control by the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] or one of its predecessors.

The Seaboard Air Line Railroad merged with the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] on July 1, 1967, to form the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]].

==Predecessor lines==

<doc id="1208647" wikidata="Q1522063" url="?curid=1208647" title="Hockliffe">
<text>Hockliffe is a village and civil parish in Bedfordshire on the crossroads of the A5 road which lies upon the course of the Roman road known as Watling Street and the A4012 and B5704 roads.

It is about east of Leighton Buzzard. Nearby places are Heath and Reach, Eggington, Stanbridge, Battlesden, Toddington, Tebworth and Tilsworth.

Hockliffe is in Heath and Reach ward which sends a councillor to Central Bedfordshire Council. The ward includes the villages of Heath and Reach, Hockliffe, Eggington, Stanbridge, Tilsworth, Tebworth and Wingrave. The ward was created in 2011 and has since been represented by Councillor Mark Versallion.

==Clipstone Brook==

There was a term applied from the 18th century which was &quot;as straight as Hockley Brook&quot; because of the meandering bends of the said brook. The correct name of the brook is the Clipstone Brook. The first field (though in the parish of Chalgrave) is still known by locals as the Old Ride, due to the original crossing of the brook of the original Woburn Road the later road being constructed in the 19th century through to the second Battlesden road turning near to the village of Milton Bryan. The new Woburn Road is about a 100 yards to the west from the said crossing and is now used by farm vehicles over a newer bridge. The second field was known as Horseshoe Corner as the brook was shaped like a horseshoe before it was straightened out by a farmer after the Second World War.

Recently there have been regular sightings of the invasive signal crayfish, &quot;Pacifastacus leniusculus&quot;, in the brook. It was noted in the local newspaper, &quot;The Leighton Buzzard Observer&quot;, that one was found inside a toy lobster during a clear out of a section of the brook near Leighton Buzzard in 2009.

==Hockliffe Radio Station==
During the Second World War a Czechoslovak military intelligence wireless transmission station was situated just outside Hockliffe. The station was constructed by the Special Operations Executive in 1942 exclusively for Czech intelligence services. The station was used to contact Czech embassies in such countries as Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. Eleven men operated the station until June 1945, when they were able to return to their country.

==Education==

The education authority, for the Leighton Buzzard area, since September 2019, calculates distances from each residence to the nearest lower school (in most circumstances) and uses that to determine priority admissions; the education authority uses computer systems to do this. Designated catchment zones are, as of 2024, no longer used for lower schools in the Leighton Buzzard area. Hockliffe is among the areas under this admissions regime.

==Notable people==
During the 18th century Dr. William Dodd became rector of Hockliffe; he was later convicted of forgery and hanged at Tyburn.

Hockliffe is the birthplace of Arthur Henry Neumann (1850–1907), a British explorer, hunter, soldier and travel writer, famous for his exploits in Equatorial East Africa at the end of the 19th century. In 1898, he published &quot;Elephant Hunting in East Equatorial Africa&quot; that contained descriptions of his childhood in Hockliffe.

Hockliffe was the birthplace of John Atcheler (1791–1867), who described himself as Horse Slaughterer to Queen Victoria.

<doc id="1208648" wikidata="Q5180562" url="?curid=1208648" title="Crafts Council">
<text>The Crafts Council is the national development agency for contemporary craft in the United Kingdom, and is funded by Arts Council England.

==History==
The Crafts Advisory Committee was formed in 1971 to advise the Minister for the Arts, David Eccles, 1st Viscount Eccles, ‘on the needs of the artist craftsman and to promote a nation-wide interest and improvement in their products’. 
Its first meeting was held on 6 October 1971 at the Council of Industrial Design (later the Design Council). It was later chaired by Sir Paul Sinker. 

In 1973, the Committee purchased Waterloo Place, London. It began publishing the journal &quot;Crafts&quot;. It also held its first exhibition, &quot;The Craftsman&#x27;s Art&quot; (1973) at the Victoria and Albert Museum, accompanied by publication of the exhibition catalog of the same name. In 1974, it launched the Crafts Advisory Committee Index, an information service for and about craftspeople.

In April 1979 the Crafts Advisory Committee was renamed the Crafts Council.
In 1982, the organisation was granted a Royal Charter and became independent of the Design Council.

In 1991, the Crafts Council moved to 44a Pentonville Road, London, where premises included a reference library, a shop, a café, an education workshop and a gallery space. In 1999 it became a funded organisation of the Arts Council of Great Britain (later the Arts Council of England).

In 2006, the Crafts Council decreased its on-site activity and closed the gallery, shop, education workshop and café in order for the Crafts Council to increase its regional activity via partnership working.

In 2011, its 40th anniversary year, over 400,000 visitors saw its five temporary exhibitions, 27,000 people attended its craft fairs, and over 7,000 children and young people participated in its nationwide initiatives.

== Funding ==
The Crafts Council is supported by Arts Council England.

The Crafts Council is also supported by a number of trusts and foundations and private patrons who support touring exhibitions, professional development schemes and participation and learning programmes. All meet the aims and objectives of charitable organisations supporting the arts.

==People==
The Crafts Council is made up of a number of specialist teams, reflecting the various aspects of its work, and is overseen by a Senior Management Team, and ultimately a board of Trustees.

<doc id="1208653" wikidata="Q10325351" url="?curid=1208653" title="Tom Starcevich">
<text>Leslie Thomas Starcevich, VC (5 September 1918 – 17 November 1989) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of British and Commonwealth armed forces. He received the award as member of the 2/43rd Battalion, during the Borneo campaign of the Second World War.

==Early life==
Leslie Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Starcevich was born on 5 September 1918 at Subiaco, Western Australia, the son of immigrants: Gertrude May Starcevich ( Waters; born , Dunkirk, Kent, England) and Josip Starčević (born , Croatia-Slavonia, Austro-Hungarian Empire). The couple were married in 1915 at Mount Magnet, Western Australia. Starcevich and his older brother, Joseph Frederick &quot;Joe&quot; Starcevich (20 August 1915 – 27 May 2007), grew up on a farm at Grass Patch, north of Esperance. Tom and Joe had eight siblings.

==Military service==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Tom and Joe Starcevich enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force: Joe on 23 October 1940, after which he was assigned to the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion; and Tom on 9 April 1941 (service number WX11519), becoming a member of the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. Joe Starcevich became a prisoner of war following the surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942. He endured harsh conditions in captivity, including forced labour at Japanese prisoner of war camps at Changi Prison, the Burma-Thailand Railway and Nagasaki, Japan but survived the war.

Tom Starcevich served with the 2/43rd Battalion in the North African campaign and was wounded in the thigh on 17 July 1942 at Ruin Ridge, Egypt during the First Battle of El Alamein. He also saw action the following year in the Huon Peninsula during the New Guinea campaign.

The 9th Division landed in Brunei Bay on 10 June 1945 with the 2/43rd Battalion landing at Labuan Island. Nine days later the battalion moved to the mainland and, on 28 June, during the capture of Beaufort, during fighting in North Borneo, the lead section of Starcevich&#x27;s company came under fire from two Japanese machine-gun positions and suffered casualties. Starcevich, a Bren gunner, moved forward and assaulted each position in turn, killing five Japanese soldiers and causing the remainder of the machine guns&#x27; crews to retreat. Later that day, when the company was again held up by two machine gun positions, Starcevich adopted similar tactics and single-handedly captured both positions, killing seven members of their crews. For his actions, Starcevich was awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation for the award was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 6 November 1945, reading:

Starcevich was presented with the ribbon of the Victoria Cross by Brigadier Victor Windeyer, during a unit parade at Papar in North Borneo on 12 November 1945. He was presented with the actual medal at Government House, Perth on 27 May 1947 by Sir James Mitchell, Lieutenant Governor of Western Australia.

Starcevich held the rank of private throughout his military service and was discharged on 12 February 1946, as part of the prolonged demobilisation process that followed the end of hostilities. He reportedly wanted to re-enlist in the Australian Army during the Korean War, but his wife talked him out of it.

==Post-war life==
Starcevich spent the first four years after the war as a motor vehicle sales representative in Perth. He married Kathleen Betty Warr ( Hardy), at the Perth registry office on 19 December 1947. The couple had three children but divorced in 1969.

From 1951, Tom and Joe Starcevich obtained and jointly worked a soldier settlement wheat and sheep farm at Carnamah. In 1981, Tom Starcevich moved back to Grass Patch, where he had bought a small farm. He died at Esperance, Western Australia, on 17 November 1989, aged 71.

==Memorials==
The track in Borneo on which Starcevich&#x27;s celebrated action occurred was later renamed Victoria Cross Road. He is also commemorated by Starcevich Monument.

Starcevich&#x27;s VC is on display at the Army Museum of Western Australia, in Fremantle, Western Australia. A bronze statue of Starcevich was unveiled at Grass Patch in 1995. The Leslie Starcevich Ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood is named in his honour.

<doc id="1208658" wikidata="Q580574" url="?curid=1208658" title="Neustadt International Prize for Literature">
<text>The Neustadt International Prize for Literature is a biennial award for literature sponsored by the University of Oklahoma and its international literary publication, &quot;World Literature Today&quot;.

It is considered one of the more prestigious international literary prizes, often compared with the Nobel Prize in Literature. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called the prize “The Oklahoma Nobel” in 1982, and the prize is sometimes referred to as the “American Nobel”. Since it was founded in 1970, some 30 of its laureates, candidates, or jurors have also been awarded Nobel Prizes. Like the Nobel, it is awarded to individuals for their entire body of work, not for a single one.

==History==
The Neustadt International Prize for Literature was established as the Books Abroad International Prize for Literature in 1969 by Ivar Ivask, editor of &quot;Books Abroad&quot;. It was subsequently renamed the Books Abroad/Neustadt Prize, and the award assumed its present name in 1976. It is the first international literary award of this scope to originate in the United States and is one of the very few international prizes for which poets, novelists, and playwrights are equally eligible.

==Award==
The Prize is a silver eagle feather, a certificate, and $50,000 USD. The award was endowed by Walter and Doris Neustadt of Ardmore, Oklahoma to ensure the award in perpetuity.

The charter of the Neustadt Prize stipulates that the award be given in recognition of outstanding achievement in poetry, fiction, or drama and that it be conferred solely on the basis of literary merit. Any living author writing in any language is eligible, provided only that at least a representative portion of his or her work is available in English, the language used during the jury deliberations. The prize may serve to crown a lifetime&#x27;s achievement or to direct attention to an important body of work that is still developing. The prize is not open to application.

==Selection==
Candidates are selected by a jury of at least seven members. Selection is not limited by geographic area, language or genre.

The Neustadt International Prize for Literature is the only international literary award of this scope developed in the United States. It is one of few international prizes for which poets, novelists and playwrights alike are equally eligible.

<doc id="1208663" wikidata="Q7293912" url="?curid=1208663" title="Rape pornography">
<text>Rape pornography is a subgenre of pornography involving the description or depiction of rape. Such pornography either involves simulated rape, wherein sexually consenting adults feign rape, or it involves actual rape. Victims of actual rape may be coerced to feign consent such that the pornography produced deceptively appears as simulated rape or non-rape pornography. The depiction of rape in non-pornographic media is not considered rape pornography. Simulated scenes of rape and other forms of sexual violence have appeared in mainstream cinema, including rape and revenge films, almost since its advent.

The legality of simulated rape pornography varies across legal jurisdictions. It is controversial because of the argument that it encourages people to commit rape. However, studies of the effects of pornography depicting sexual violence produce conflicting results. The creation of real rape pornography is a sex crime in countries where rape is illegal. Real rape pornography, including statutory rape in child pornography, is created for profit and other reasons. Rape pornography, as well as revenge porn and other similar subgenres depicting violence, has been associated with rape culture.

==Legality==
===United Kingdom===
The possession of rape pornography is illegal in Scotland, England and Wales.

In Scotland, the &quot;Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010&quot; criminalised possession of &quot;extreme&quot; pornography. This included depictions of rape, and &quot;other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity, whether violent or otherwise&quot;, including those involving consenting adults and images that were faked. The maximum penalty is an unlimited fine and 3 years imprisonment. The law is not often used, and it resulted in only one prosecution during the first four years that it was in force.

In England and Wales, it took another five years before pornography which depicts rape (including simulations involving consenting adults) was made illegal in England and Wales, bringing the law into line with that of Scotland. Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 had already criminalised possession of &quot;extreme pornography&quot; but it did not explicitly specify depictions of rape. At that time it was thought that the sale of rape pornography might already be illegal in England and Wales as a result of the Obscene Publications Act 1959, but the ruling in &quot;R v Peacock&quot; in January 2012 demonstrated that this was not the case. The introduction of a new law was first announced in 2013 by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron. In a speech to the NSPCC he stated that pornography that depicts simulated rape &quot;normalise(s) sexual violence against women&quot;, although the Ministry of Justice criminal policy unit had previously stated that &quot;we have no evidence to show that the creation of staged rape images involves any harm to the participants or causes harm to society at large&quot;.

In February 2015, Section 16 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 amended the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 to criminalise the possession of pornographic imagery depicting acts of rape. The law only applies to consensual, simulated, fantasy material. The possession of an image capturing an actual rape, for example CCTV footage, is not illegal; but a &quot;make believe&quot; image created by and for consenting adults is open to prosecution. In January 2014 sexual freedom campaign groups criticised Section 16 as being poorly defined and liable to criminalise a wider range of material than originally suggested. However, in April 2014 the BBFC&#x27;s presentation to Parliament suggested that the proposed legislation would not cover &quot;clearly fictional depictions of rape and other sexual violence in which participants are clearly actors, acting to a script&quot;.

===Germany===
In Germany, the distribution of pornography featuring real or faked rape is illegal.

===United States===
There are few practical legal restrictions on rape pornography in the United States. Law enforcement agencies concentrate on examples where they believe a crime has been committed in the production. &quot;Fantasy&quot; rape pornography depicting rape simulations involving consenting adults are not a priority for the police.

In response to the verdict of the &quot;People v. Turner&quot; sexual assault case, xHamster instituted a &quot;Brock Turner rule&quot;, which banned videos involving rape, including those involving sex with an unconscious or hypnotised partner.

==Real rape cases==

===Non-internet===
American porn actress Linda Lovelace wrote in her autobiography, &quot;Ordeal&quot;, that she was coerced and raped in pornographic films in the 1970s.

===Internet===

Internet policing with respect to investigating actual crime has been made increasingly difficult by rape pornography websites operating anonymously, ignoring ICANN regulations and providing false information for the Whois database.

From 2009 to 2020, the pornographic company GirlsDoPorn created hundreds of pornographic videos in which the women depicted were manipulated, coerced, lied to, given marijuana or other drugs or physically forced to have sex, according to the accounts of victims and material from a lawsuit against the company. Six people involved in the website were charged with sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion in November 2019. Official videos from the company were viewed over a billion times, including a paid subscription service on its website, and an estimated 680 million views on the tube site Pornhub, where the official channel was among the site&#x27;s top 20 most viewed. Pirated copies of the videos were also viewed hundreds of millions of times. According to a lawsuit, the videos could still be found on mainstream pornography websites up to at least December 2020.

Japanese women were forced to be in pornographic videos in the 2010s.

Real rape videos of women and girls were filmed in the Doctor&#x27;s Room and Nth Room cases in South Korea in late 2010s and early 2020s.

Videos showing real rape have been hosted on popular pornographic video sharing and pornography websites. These websites have been criticized by petitioners.

====Cybersex trafficking====

Victims of cybersex trafficking have been forced into live streaming rape pornography, which can be recorded and later sold. They are raped by traffickers in front of a webcam or forced to perform sex acts on themselves or other victims. The traffickers film and broadcast the sex crimes in real time. Victims are frequently forced to watch the paying consumers on shared screens and follow their orders. It occurs in locations, commonly referred to as ‘cybersex dens,’ that can be in homes, hotels, offices, internet cafes, and other businesses.

<doc id="1208665" wikidata="Q24791" url="?curid=1208665" title="Five (group)">
<text>Five (stylised as 5ive) are an English boy band formed in 1997 consisting of members Sean Conlon, Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, Abz Love and Jason &quot;J&quot; Brown. Five released several hit singles around the turn of the 21st century, particularly in their native United Kingdom. The group has sold over 20 million records worldwide. 

Five were formed by Heart Management, who held auditions to create a boy band. The group were subsequently signed by Simon Cowell and BMG/RCA. In November 1997, Five released their debut single &quot;Slam Dunk (Da Funk)&quot;, which peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Their subsequent single, &quot;When the Lights Go Out&quot;, became an international hit, peaking at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States, 4 in the UK, and within the top ten of six further countries. Their debut album, &quot;Five&quot; (1998), sold over 4 million copies worldwide and produced 3 additional UK top 3 singles: &quot;Got the Feelin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Everybody Get Up&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s the Things You Do&quot;.

Their second album, &quot;Invincible&quot; (1999), sold over 1 million copies worldwide and contains the number 2 UK hit &quot;If Ya Gettin&#x27; Down&quot; as well as the number ones and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;Keep On Movin&#x27;&quot;, the latter of which became their biggest selling single. Five released their third album, &quot;Kingsize&quot; (2001), amid tensions within the group. Conlon did not appear in the music video for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Nevertheless, the band attributed his lack of participation in the video and promotional activities to illness, and the song became a number one hit. In September, the group announced that they would be splitting; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released that November.

The group briefly reformed without Conlon in September 2006, but soon disbanded. In 2012, they announced that they were planning another reunion, this time with Conlon on board but without Brown. The group continued with only four members, but decided to keep the name Five. Alongside other musical groups, Five were featured in the ITV2 documentary series &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; (2013). This was followed by the collaborative Big Reunion tour that May. In August 2014, Love announced his departure from the band, leaving Conlon, Neville, and Robinson to continue as a trio until February 2025 when the original lineup reformed.

==Career==
===1997–1998: Formation and &quot;5ive&quot;===
In 1997, an advertisement was placed in the UK performing arts newspaper &quot;The Stage&quot;, asking for young male singers/dancers to audition for a boy band-style group with &quot;attitude and edge&quot;. Bob and Chris Herbert of Heart Management, the two men who had earlier created the Spice Girls, thought the time was right for a male group. Over 3,000 hopefuls auditioned, including Russell Brand, who performed Extreme&#x27;s song &quot;More Than Words&quot; for the judges. They were finally narrowed down to only 14, five of whom had arranged themselves into a group while waiting for their audition. The auditions resulted in a provisional casting of nine members: Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, Sean Conlon, Jason &quot;J&quot; Brown, Richard Breen (now better known as Abz Love), and Peter Cheshire, Paul Taylor, Anthony Baker (rapper) and Ric Hershon. As his first name is Richard, Breen used his nickname &#x27;Abs&#x27; (from his middle name, &quot;Abidin&quot;) to avoid confusion with Ritchie (born Richard Neville Dobson). Cheshire and Taylor were later cut when the final members were chosen in May 1997 and Hershon could not attend the final selection. Baker made it into the band originally, but doubt was cast over his rapping style as his North East accent came through. The management initially were looking a four piece band, and were going to select J, Sean, Scott and Ritchie for the band, but when they saw Abs with the others they decided a five piece would work better.

The group were subsequently signed by Simon Cowell and BMG/RCA for a six-album deal. Five practiced and demoed their work at Trinity Studios in Knaphill. In November 1997, Five released their debut single &quot;Slam Dunk (Da Funk)&quot;, which debuted at number 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was also released in the U.S. in 1998 but had little chart success, reaching number 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, although it was chosen as the NBA&#x27;s new theme song. In 1998, Five earned their first major international hit, &quot;When the Lights Go Out&quot;, which cracked the U.S. top 10 and earned Gold status there soon after. Five then went on an eight-day tour to promote their upcoming album, appearing in a concert special for the Disney Channel with Irish girl group B*Witched, in Times Square in New York City and on MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot;. The debut album &quot;5ive&quot; peaked at number 27 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the charts in other countries worldwide, including the UK. 

&quot;It&#x27;s the Things You Do&quot; was released in late 1998 in the U.S., only to receive a lukewarm reception. The group embarked upon a U.S. tour with the American boy band NSYNC, but soon after pulled out due to exhaustion, flying back to England to rest and start work on a new album. Still from the first album, &quot;Got the Feelin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Everybody Get Up&quot;, and &quot;Until the Time Is Through&quot; were all released as singles in the UK throughout 1998. Five reached the top 5 in several countries around the world, and the latter two singles each rose to the number two spot in the UK. A significant element in Five&#x27;s popularity was their resemblance to groups such as New Kids on the Block, East 17, the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC in their uptempo musical style and &#x27;street&#x27; image, in contrast to Take That, Boyzone, and 98 Degrees, who at the time were primarily known for their ballads. Five also wrote or co-wrote the majority of their songs, which was atypical of boy bands at the time.

Five were famously offered songs that turned out to be huge hits for Britney Spears and &#x27;N Sync. In 1997, Max Martin was working on the song &quot;...Baby One More Time.&quot; It was originally written for the Backstreet Boys, and was turned down; it was later also passed on by TLC. Simon Cowell offered Martin an Aston Martin luxury vehicle if Martin would give the song to Five. Five initially began writing verses, however, Martin had promised the song to up-and-coming Britney Spears. In keeping his word, the finished song went to Britney. Five were later offered &quot;Bye Bye Bye,&quot; by Martin with the only completed lyric being &quot;ain&#x27;t no lie baby, bye bye bye.&quot; Upon hearing the song and attempting to write verses, Scott Robinson noted it sounded more like &#x27;N Sync song than a Five song. The band subsequently passed on the song.
===1999–2000: &quot;Invincible&quot;===
In August 1999, the first single of their second album, &quot;Invincible&quot;, &quot;If Ya Gettin&#x27; Down&quot;, was released and became a major hit worldwide but yet again failed to go to number 1 in their home country, kept out of the top spot by Ricky Martin. Finally, in October 1999, after three consecutive number-two peaks, &quot;Keep On Movin&#x27;&quot; became their first UK number 1, as well as their biggest selling single to date. The second album hit the top five shortly thereafter. &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Let You Go&quot; was released in early March 2000, peaking at number 9. On 3 March 2000, Five opened at the BRIT Awards with rock legends Queen, performing an updated version of that band&#x27;s hit, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. That night Five won their first BRIT Award, as &quot;Best Pop Act&quot;, and their cover of the Queen song went on to become their second number 1 in the UK in July 2000.

The first half of 2000 found Five on a successful world tour, performing concerts in the UK, Europe, Russia, Australasia and—as a foursome—South America, after Neville contracted chickenpox and had to be flown back to England. After finishing the tour, Five continued to perform at many concerts in the UK, including Party in the Park with Queen. A re-issue of &quot;Invincible&quot; included remixed versions of a couple of songs and five live tracks from their tour, as well as a bonus track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It Baby&quot;. Due for release in July 2000 in the US, the song was pulled from release after the group was dropped by their stateside label, Arista Records. Five also had problems with their Asian record company, and subsequently cancelled their Asian tour. Suffering from this major blow, the lads headed back to the studio and started writing songs for their next album. They continued to win awards in the UK and Europe, and in December 2000 launched their second big tour, in their home country.

===2001: &quot;Kingsize&quot; and split===
In January 2001, Five performed at Rock in Rio in Rio de Janeiro to an audience of almost 500,000 people. By May 2001, their third studio album &quot;Kingsize&quot; was completed. The following month, the group began a promotional campaign for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. On 9 July, the group announced that Sean Conlon had contracted glandular fever and would be taking time off from the group for at least four weeks. The other four members continued promotional activities in his stead; Conlon later revealed that he was not suffering from fever but instead from a stress-induced mental breakdown caused by conflict within the group. In the video for &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, recorded in mid-July, a life-size cardboard cut-out of Conlon was used in his place. &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was released commercially in mid August, and became their third UK number one, holding the top spot for two weeks. On 23 August, the group canceled several planned promotional performances after Ritchie Neville damaged his achilles tendon. The group also noted the continued absence of Conlon, adding that he was suffering from &quot;physical and mental exhaustion&quot;. &quot;Kingsize&quot; was released on 28 August and debuted at number three, going on to achieve Gold status. 

On 27 September 2001, the group announced that they would be splitting. On 22 October, the group released their final single from &quot;Kingsize&quot;, a double A-side single with &quot;Closer to Me&quot; and &quot;Rock the Party&quot;. On 19 November, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released with 15 past hits, two remixes and one new song. 

===2006–2007: First reunion===
On 17 September 2006, an announcement was made via Five&#x27;s official Myspace page that a press conference was to be held at The Scala in central London on 27 September. After a venue change due to a shooting at The Scala, the conference was moved to the Bar Academy Islington. It was confirmed at the press conference that four of the five members would be reuniting (Conlon now being committed to his Sony deal). Five recorded new material for what was to be their fourth studio album, working with Guy Chambers, Swedish producer/songwriter Anders Bagge, and French DJs Trak Invaders. They also planned to tour in 2007. By January 2007, Five had completed half of their album and were looking to be signed to a record label with new manager, Richard Beck, who also secured an MTV documentary series titled &quot;Five - The Revive&quot;. The album was expected to be released within the next few months. On 8 March 2007, Five premiered one-minute clips of three brand new songs via their MySpace page. On 19 May 2007, having failed to secure a lucrative enough record deal, the group announced via their website that they would no longer be pursuing a comeback.

===2012–2024: Second reunion, Love&#x27;s departure and &quot;Time&quot;===
In 2012, Conlon reunited with his former bandmates to discuss the possibility of a second reunion. The return was announced on 18 October as a four-piece without Brown, who later stated that he declined to participate over privacy concerns. In 2013, the group took part in the documentary series &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;. This was followed by the collaborative Big Reunion tour that May. On 16 September 2013, the band picked up the award for Best Music Act (On a Reality TV Show) at the National Reality TV Awards. In November and December 2013, Five embarked on their own tour in UK and Australia, the 5ive Greatest Hits Tour. Love announced that he had left the group in August 2014 via Twitter, without telling the other members beforehand. In February 2016, Five released the compilation &quot;Keep On Movin&#x27; – The Best of Five&quot;.

In April 2019, the group announced they would be joined by 911, Damage and A1 for a tour of the UK called &quot;The Boys Are Back!&quot; in 2020. Robinson also stated that there was no chance of the band&#x27;s original full line-up returning. He told the Press Association: &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be down to us to reach out to [Brown and Love]. They&#x27;ve made it very clear they didn&#x27;t want to be in the band. It&#x27;s like Take That, with Jason Orange and Robbie Williams leaving. It still works, the songs are still the same.&quot; The tour was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and shows were rescheduled for 2021.

In late 2020, Five announced they would be embarking on another Australian Greatest Hits tour in 2021 supported by Australian pop duo Sister2Sister. FOn 11 June, Five released &quot;Keep On Movin (21 Remix)&quot;. On 6 August, Five released two promotional singles titled &quot;Shangri-La&quot; and &quot;Making Me Fall&quot;. On 1 October, they released the single &quot;Warm Light&quot;. Five released their fourth studio album, &quot;Time&quot; on 28 January 2022. Robinson told &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;We always said we wouldn&#x27;t do new music, which came from a fear of competing with our former selves. But when the pandemic hit and all our live dates were cancelled, the timing felt right. We&#x27;re really happy with it and from my personal view, it&#x27;s the album I&#x27;m proudest of.&quot;

On 5 March 2024, the group began embarking on an Australian Greatest Hits Tour.

===2025–present: Reunion and UK tour===
On 24 February 2025, Love posted on Twitter that he was once again part of the group after leaving in 2014. The next day, J Brown made a similar post, implying he had also rejoined the group. On 27 February 2025, the group confirmed their reunion as a five-piece, and announced the Keep On Movin&#x27; 2025 Tour which will take place across the UK, and feature Naughty Boy as a special guest.

<text>Percy Clyde Statton, (21 October 1890 – 5 December 1959) was an Australian farmer, soldier, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Serving as a sergeant during the First World War, Statton was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1918 following his assault on four German machine guns. With three men, Statton rushed the posts armed with only a revolver and succeeded in capturing the first gun. Moving to the second, he killed the crew of five himself before the two remaining gun crews were forced to retreat.

Born in Tasmania, Statton was married and working as a farmer when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1916. Posted to the 40th Battalion, he was shipped to England, where he spent three months training. Arriving on the Western Front in 1917, Statton was awarded the Military Medal during the Battle of Messines for leading carrying parties to the front line under heavy artillery and machine gun fire. Wounded twice during the war, Statton returned to Australia in 1919 and was discharged the following year. In 1934, he took part in rescue work aiding families isolated by severe bushfires in the Derwent Valley. Following a period of service during the Second World War, Statton died of stomach cancer in 1959.

==Early life==
Statton was born in Beaconsfield, Tasmania, on 21 October 1890 to Edward Statton, a miner, and his wife Maggie Lavinia (née Hoskins). He was educated at Zeehan State School, before gaining employment as a farmer in Tyenna. Giving his age as twenty-one, Statton married Elsie May Pearce in a Methodist ceremony on 12 September 1907; the couple later had a son and two daughters.

==First World War==
Despite his wife&#x27;s disapproval, Statton enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 29 February 1916, and was allotted to the newly raised 40th Battalion as a private. Appointed lance corporal on 22 May, Statton embarked from Hobart aboard HMAT &quot;Berrima&quot; on 1 July, bound for England. The troopship disembarked at Devonport a little over seven weeks later, where the 40th Battalion spent the next three months training.

Promoted to corporal on 19 November 1916, Statton embarked along with the rest of the 40th Battalion for France and the Western Front four days later. Initially posted to Le Havre, the battalion was transferred to Flanders in Belgium in early 1917. Statton was promoted to temporary sergeant on 16 January 1917, which was made substantive from 26 April. In June, the 40th Battalion took part in the Battle of Messines.

Over a three-day period during the engagement at Messines from 7–9 June, Statton was placed in charge of supervising and leading carrying parties to the front line. Throughout this work, he was subject to heavy German artillery and machine gun fire, and on several occasions the party was decimated by shellfire. Despite this, the parties managed to reach the front line on every occasion. For his actions, Statton was awarded the Military Medal, the recommendation for which cited his &quot;exceptional fine work and gallant conduct&quot;. The notification of the award was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 16 August 1917.

On 12 October 1917, Statton was involved in operations during the First Battle of Passchendaele when he suffered a gunshot wound to his right shoulder. First admitted to the 22nd General Hospital, Douane, Statton was transferred to the VAD Hospital, Tonbridge, as the wound required treatment in England. Having sufficiently recovered after a period of hospitalisation at the Fort Pitt Military Hospital, Chatham, and 3rd Auxiliary Hospital, Dartford, Statton was granted two weeks&#x27; leave from 28 January 1918. Returning to duty, he was attached to the Overseas Training Brigade at Longbridge Deverill prior to re-embarking on 1 May for France, where he rejoined the 40th Battalion.

While in action around the village of Villers-Bretonneux on 10 June, Statton was wounded in a gas attack on his position. Initially admitted to the 10th Australian Field Ambulance, he was transferred to the 40th Casualty Clearing Station six days later, before returning to the 40th Battalion on 24 June. Beginning on 8 July, Statton was placed on a five-day attachment to a demonstration platoon at the 10th Brigade Headquarters. Returning to his battalion, he was attached to the United States 3rd Battalion, 130th Regiment, for service over a seven-day period later that month. He rejoined the 40th Battalion on 27 July.

===Victoria Cross===
Between 10–12 August 1918, the 3rd Australian Division—of which the 40th Battalion was part—was ordered to attack from an easterly direction against the southern bank of the Somme River, and advance along the road past Proyart. On 12 August, the 40th Battalion was tasked with the objective of seizing and holding a valley to the south of the Proyart–Chuignes road. The advance entailed moving the battalion across approximately of open ground, while under the direct observation of German forces on high ground to the east of Proyart. At the same time, the 37th Battalion was to move through the village of Proyart itself, and proceed to a line just beyond the railway to the north of the Proyart–Chuignes road. It was during this action that Statton was to earn the Victoria Cross.

The 40th Battalion began its attack at approximately 07:30, and by 08:30 had successfully advanced . It was at this point, however, that the unit came under an intense barrage from German artillery, and were prevented from moving further forward. With assistance from a Lewis Gun team under Statton&#x27;s command, the battalion&#x27;s A Company managed to reach the centre of Proyart village an hour later. The remainder of the 40th Battalion attempted to follow, but soon became subject to heavy machine gun fire. With his Lewis Gun, Statton engaged two German machine gun posts and thus enabled the remainder of his battalion to continue its advance. The battalion was later able to reach its objectives.

At 18:00, the 40th Battalion received a message that the 37th Battalion was about to attempt to advance from the village to its own objective. From his position, Statton observed a line of German machine gunners firing on the 37th Battalion and preventing its advance. He turned his Lewis Guns on them in an attempt to assist a party of men from the 37th as they attacked. Having failed, a party of thirteen men were assembled and rushed the position soon after, but the group was wiped out before they reached the first gun. Gathering Corporal Upchurch and Privates Leslie Styles and Beard, Statton worked his way along under the cover of the Chuignes road embankment. Reaching within of the machine gunners and armed with only a revolver, Statton led the three men as they rushed across the open ground towards the German strongpoint. Reaching the position, the party was able to dispose of the first gun and its crew before moving onto the second, where Statton personally shot four of the five crew members and bayoneted the fifth with his own rifle. Seeing this, the two remaining gun teams began to retreat but were killed by Statton&#x27;s Lewis Gunners.

Soon after, another German machine gun opened up, killing Private Styles and wounding Corporal Upchurch. With Private Beard, Statton began to crawl back to his own lines, while the inspired 37th Battalion continued its advance and cheered the pair as they went past. Later that evening, Statton, while under heavy machine gun fire, went out and retrieved the badly wounded Upchurch and the body of Styles. By 20:00, both battalions had reached and consolidated their positions, and were relieved by the British 17th Division the following day.

At 09:00 on 27 September 1918, the 40th Battalion was ordered onto parade by the unit&#x27;s Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel John Lord. Addressing the assembled crowd, Lord announced that that same day, the name of Sergeant Percy Statton would appear in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; announcing that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. Described by the battalion&#x27;s history as a &quot;reluctant hero&quot;, Statton was granted three cheers before he was carried shoulder high through the ranks while the battalion band played. The full citation for Statton&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; later that day, reading:

===Later war service===
From 20 October 1918, Statton was granted ten days&#x27; leave to Paris. Returning to the 40th Battalion, he was sent to Amiens the following day and attached to 4th Army Guard for special duties over a three-day period. Briefly re-joining his battalion, Statton was shipped to England on 5 November for special duties. During this time, the Armistice was signed officially declaring the war&#x27;s end, and Statton was granted two weeks&#x27; leave in December.

Returning to France on 27 January 1919, Statton was attached to the Headquarters of the Australian Base Depot from 25 March. Shipped to England in June, Statton attended an investiture ceremony in the Quadrangle of Buckingham Palace, where he was presented with his Victoria Cross by King George V. During his time in England, Statton undertook a course at the Motor Training Institute in preparation for non-military employment, before he was granted a month&#x27;s leave. Returning to duty on 24 September, Statton boarded HT &quot;Pakeha&quot; twelve days later and departed for Australia. The troopship arrived in Tasmania on 26 November and Statton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 19 January 1920.

==Later life==
Following his discharge, Statton settled in Fitzgerald, Tasmania, where he gained employment in the timber industry. True to her word that she would leave him if he went off to war, Statton&#x27;s wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General&#x27;s Office, Hobart. In 1934, severe bushfires broke out in the Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated by the fire.

During the Second World War, Statton enlisted for service with the Volunteer Defence Corps of the Australian Military Forces. Commissioned as a lieutenant on 18 June 1942, he served throughout the war with the 5th Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps, until his discharge on 9 January 1946. Statton&#x27;s wife died in 1945, and on 16 December 1947, he married Monica Enid Effie Kingston; the pair later had a son. The couple lived at Ouse, where Statton worked as a commercial agent and was a member of the local council.

In 1956, Statton joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London&#x27;s Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the award. At the Repatriation General Hospital, Hobart, on 5 December 1959, Statton died of stomach cancer. Accorded a full military funeral, Statton was cremated and his ashes interred at the Cornelian Bay Cemetery. His Victoria Cross is currently on display at the Australian War Memorial.

<doc id="1208672" wikidata="Q3439081" url="?curid=1208672" title="Roger Hollis">
<text>Sir Roger Henry Hollis (2 December 1905 – 26 October 1973) was a British intelligence officer who served with MI5 from 1938 to 1965. He was Director General of MI5 from 1956 to 1965.

Some commentators, including the journalist Chapman Pincher and intelligence officer Peter Wright, suggested that Hollis was a Soviet agent. In his book &quot;The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5&quot; (2009), the Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew rejects this theory.

The government&#x27;s official position, first stated by Margaret Thatcher, is that there was no evidence that Hollis was a traitor.

==Early years, family, and education==
Hollis&#x27;s father, the Right Reverend George Hollis, was Bishop of Taunton. His mother was the daughter of a Canon of Wells Cathedral. Hollis was educated at Clifton College, Bristol. From 1924 to the spring of 1926, he attended Worcester College, Oxford, where he read English, but left without completing his degree. At Oxford he was part of the Hypocrites&#x27; Club.

==Professional career==
From the spring of 1926 into 1927, he was a clerk for the Standard Chartered Bank in London. In early 1927, he went to Hong Kong as a freelance journalist, then moved to Shanghai. From 1 April 1928, he worked for British American Tobacco. In 1930, he transferred to Beijing.

In June 1938, he joined MI5 F Division (Countersubversion). Many departments of MI5, including F Division, moved from London to Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, during World War II, due to threat of bombing. From 1953 to 1956, Hollis was MI5 Deputy Director General under Dick White, succeeding White in 1956 and remaining in that post until his retirement in 1965.

==Mole suspicions==

=== During his life ===
After Kim Philby&#x27;s flight from Beirut to Moscow in 1963, rumours began to circulate that Hollis had alerted him to his impending arrest. Hollis was criticised for not alerting John Profumo, the War Secretary in Prime Minister Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government, that he might have become entangled with a Soviet spy ring through his friendship with Stephen Ward and his affair with showgirl Christine Keeler, who was introduced by Ward to Profumo. Soviet Naval Attache Eugene Ivanov was also involved with Keeler at this time, in the early 1960s, and sought to learn the date of American plans to arm nuclear warheads in West Germany, from Profumo through Keeler. Profumo had to resign in mid-1963, and the resulting scandal did much to bring the Labour Party to power in the October 1964 General Election.

During the 1950s and 1960s, a large number of MI5 operations failed in circumstances that suggested the Soviets had been tipped off. Although many such failures were subsequently blamed on the actions of such self-confessed or defected agents as Philby, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt, a number of failures occurred after all three had lost their access to secret information. Some in MI5 concluded the Soviets had an agent in a very senior position within the organisation. Peter Wright, Arthur S. Martin, Jane Sissmore and others became convinced that either Hollis or his deputy, Graham Mitchell, could be the only ones responsible, eventually confiding their suspicions to Dick White, director general of MI6. White instructed Martin to inform Hollis that Mitchell was a suspect, and Hollis instructed Martin (after due consideration) to keep Mitchell under surveillance. Author Nigel West implies that this was a deliberate ploy to keep tabs on both Mitchell and Hollis.

Martin eventually became so disgruntled and outspoken about Hollis&#x27;s attitude toward the investigation that Hollis suspended Martin for a fortnight, and the case was turned over to Wright. Much of the investigation was centred around interviews with Anthony Blunt at that time, and Wright had amassed a sizable amount of taped evidence from Blunt when Martin returned from suspension. After 1964, Blunt gradually confessed his double-agent role in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

Eventually the operation wound down. By then, some time after Hollis had retired, suspicion had shifted from Mitchell to Hollis. New Director General Martin Furnival Jones refused to sanction an investigation into Hollis. &quot;Mole Hunt&quot; (Chapter 3, page 45) noted that the investigative team known as FLUENCY had been disbanded before any conclusions had been reached.

=== Posthumous ===
In 1984, investigative journalist Chapman Pincher published &quot;Too Secret Too Long&quot;, a book which examined the early life of Hollis and his MI5 career drawing upon new sources and upon many interviews with retired intelligence personnel. Pincher published a revised edition in 2009. Pincher also accused Hollis of being a Soviet agent, although separate from the Cambridge Five spy ring. Pincher claims Hollis was recruited by Richard Sorge in China in the early 1930s to spy for the GRU. Evidence has been advanced to support these assertions by Pincher in his book, &quot;Treachery: Betrayals, Blunders, and Cover-ups: Six Decades of Espionage Against America and Great Britain&quot;, which is devoted to positing that Hollis was &quot;Elli&quot;, the highly placed mole within MI5 identified by Igor Gouzenko, and operating as a Soviet agent from the 1940s until retiring from MI5. In its obituary of Pincher, &quot;The Times&quot; discredited the journalist&#x27;s conspiracy theory (&quot;Paranoia Hollisiensis&quot;) and specified that Hollis had not been a Soviet spy.

Under Furnival Jones, the higher management of MI5 expressed indignation and loss of morale about the Hollis affair. Hollis was asked to come in and clear up the allegations. Having been the director, Hollis was aware of the procedures of the interrogation and investigation. He remained calm and composed throughout, denying all allegations. Martin and Wright and the team were unable to convince anyone else in MI5 or MI6 that they were right about Hollis. Wright retired in January 1976, upon reaching age 60 and, by his own account, was enraged at being denied a pension for his 30 years of service, on highly legalistic and technical grounds. He emigrated to Tasmania, Australia, where he wrote an account of his work at MI5. Despite attempts by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government to suppress the publication and distribution of &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, it was finally published in 1987 and eventually sold over two million copies around the world.

Wright alleges in &quot;Spycatcher&quot; that Gouzenko, who had worked for the GRU, himself deduced later that his interviewer might have been a Soviet double agent and was probably afraid that he might recognise him from case photos that Gouzenko might have seen in KGB or GRU files, hence the disguise. Gouzenko also admitted that he, being a lower level clerk, had no access to such files.

The accuracy of various allegations made in the book by Wright was questioned in a review of &quot;Spycatcher&quot; published by the Center for the Study of Intelligence, an in-house think tank for the CIA. While admitting (on page 42) that the book included &quot;factual data&quot;, the document stated that it was also &quot;filled with [unspecified] errors, exaggerations, bogus ideas, and self-inflation&quot;. The review added (on page 45) that &quot;Gen. Oleg Kalugin, former Chief of Counterintelligence&quot; had confirmed to the author that Hollis had not worked for the KGB.

Peter Wright had given a televised interview in 1984 during the dispute with Thatcher&#x27;s government. Following the interview, in July 1984, Martin wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;. In it, he stated that while Wright exaggerated the certainty with which they regarded Hollis&#x27;s guilt, Wright was justified in saying that Hollis was the most likely candidate, for the reasons Wright had cited. In her 2001 autobiography, Christine Keeler (John Profumo&#x27;s mistress), alleged, without supporting evidence, that Hollis and Stephen Ward were part of a spy ring with Sir Anthony Blunt. Ward had committed suicide on 3 August 1963 as the Profumo scandal progressed. In Keeler&#x27;s updated book, &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;, published in 2012, Keeler stated she saw Hollis visiting Ward five times at the house she shared with Ward.

In his book, &quot;The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5&quot;, a Cambridge professor, Christopher Andrew, used access to 400,000 MI5 files to compile an official history of the service. He claims he has proved conclusively that Hollis was not a double agent and that Wright was misguided at best.

Paul Monk, an Australian former senior intelligence analyst and author of the argument maps used in the Institute of World Politics panel, provides a counterpoint to the Authorized History. He believes Andrew dismisses Wright&#x27;s claims almost &quot;ad hominem&quot; but fails to address the specific points made by Pincher in his final (2009) book on the subject. He describes Andrew&#x27;s description of Hollis&#x27;s background as – in light of the allegations made against him – &quot;insouciant&quot;. Monk feels that as Andrew is arguing that Hollis is innocent, he should have given Hollis the vetting he did not receive when he entered MI5, particularly in light of Hollis&#x27;s relationships with &quot;confirmed&quot; Soviet assets, regardless of whether he was one of them. Monk discusses at length the flaws of the book, for example, the notion that Leo Long was definitely &quot;ELLI&quot;. This is supposedly disproved by KGB archives – Long is thought to be &quot;RALPH&quot; – and solely supported by the later questioned testimony of Gordievsky. He surmises with the following &quot;Christopher Andrew treads a well-worn path in failing utterly to address that case, much less refute it once and for all.&quot; In the 2009 ITV programme, &quot;Inside MI5: The Real Spooks&quot;, Oleg Gordievsky recounted how he saw the head of the British section of the KGB expressing surprise at the allegations that he read in a British newspaper about Hollis being a KGB agent, saying &quot;Why is it they are speaking about Roger Hollis, such nonsense, can&#x27;t understand it, it must be some special English trick directed against us.&quot;

In 2010, Stephen de Mowbray who worked for MI6 until 1979, stated that both Hollis and Mitchell had been exonerated. &quot;We followed Mitchell all over the place... Nothing was found. Next Hollis was investigated but eventually also cleared. There were suspicions with both of them. There are not suspicions now. But somebody was doing it.&quot;

On 21 April 2015, the Institute of World Politics held a panel debating whether or not Hollis was a mole. They published a report and chronology. One panel member, later wrote that &quot;our panel solved nothing&quot; perhaps because &quot;facts have gradually blurred with supposition and theory.&quot;

Oleg Gordievsky, a former KGB head of station in London who defected to Britain in 1985, had said that Hollis was innocent and said of Wright&#x27;s book, &quot;there was a lot of fantasy in it and malicious speculation&quot;.

The official MI5 website denies that Hollis was a Soviet agent, adding: &quot;Hollis&#x27; non-involvement with the Soviets was confirmed in the 1980s by a senior KGB defector, Oleg Gordievsky. He has described how the Soviets themselves were baffled by the allegations against Hollis.&quot;

==Family==
Hollis married Evelyn Swayne on 17 July 1937 at Wells Cathedral, with his father performing the ceremony. She was the daughter of a solicitor from Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset. The couple had one son, Adrian Hollis.

Hollis&#x27;s son, Adrian (1940–2013), was a classical scholar and Grandmaster of correspondence chess, and was British Correspondence Chess Champion in 1966, 1967 and 1971. Philosopher Martin Hollis (1938–1998) was his nephew. His elder brother, Christopher Hollis (1902–1977), was a Conservative MP for Devizes from 1945 to 1955. His nephew, Rt Rev Crispian Hollis, a Catholic convert, was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Portsmouth.

==Honours==
Hollis was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1946 Birthday Honours, Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1956 New Year Honours, knighted as a Knight Bachelor in the 1960 New Year Honours, and promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1966 New Year Honours.

<text>Bogdan or Bohdan (Cyrillic: Богдан) is a Slavic masculine name that appears in all Slavic countries as well as Romania and Moldova. It is derived from the Slavic words &quot;Bog/Boh&quot; (Cyrillic: Бог), meaning &quot;god&quot;, and &quot;dan&quot; (Cyrillic: дан), meaning &quot;given&quot;. The name appears to be an early calque from Greek Theodore (Theodotus, Theodosius) or Hebrew Matthew with the same meaning. The name is also used as a surname in Hungary, Ukraine. Bogdana is the feminine version of the name.

== Variations ==
The sound change of &#x27;g&#x27; into &#x27;h&#x27; occurred in the Ukrainian, Belarusian, Czech and Slovak languages (hence &quot;Bohdan&quot;). Although the sound change did not occur in Polish, either Bogdan or Bohdan may be used in Poland.

Slavic variants include Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian Božidar (Божидар) and Polish Bożydar, and diminutive forms and nicknames include Boguś, Bodya, Boca, Boci, Boća, Boša, Bogi, Bo, Boga Boga, Boggie. The feminine form is Bogdana or Bohdana, with variants such as &quot;Bogdanka&quot;.

Names with similar meanings include Persian Khodadad, Greek Theodore, Arabic Ataullah, Hebrew Nathaniel, Jonathan, and Matthew, Latin Deodatus, French Dieudonné, and Sanskrit Devadatta.

<doc id="1208677" wikidata="Q7653772" url="?curid=1208677" title="Swanwick, Hampshire">
<text>Swanwick () is a village in Hampshire, England, east of the River Hamble and north of the M27 motorway. 
The village is located within the borough of Fareham and is the site of the London Area Control Centre (LACC) and the London Terminal Control Centre (LTCC), part of National Air Traffic Services Air Traffic Control Centre, and Bursledon Brickworks, the last remaining example of a Victorian steam-powered brickworks.

Swanwick has no real village centre and the only commercial premises of note is the Elm Tree Public House. Since the 1980s, the gradual spread of housing developments has meant that Swanwick has partly merged with the new development of Whiteley although the only direct vehicular access is via Yew Tree Drive (once a bus only route). 
Swanwick railway station on the West Coastway Line is approximately one mile south of the village and is nearer Park Gate than Swanwick.

The village&#x27;s &quot;twin&quot; Lower Swanwick is situated two miles west of the village on the edge of the River Hamble.

==History==
Human activity at Swanwick dates back to the Bronze Age. It is understood that a ritual from the era involved the digging of shafts or wells to the underworld; one such shaft at Swanwick was found to contain 20 cylindrical loom-weights and a wooden post with organic residues believed to be the remains of flesh and blood. A refuse pit dating from Roman times has also been found at Swanwick.

In the autumn of 877 AD Alfred the Great blockaded the city of Exeter in order to capture the band of pagans there; some of the pagans fled by sea and were pursued by king&#x27;s ships to Swanwick where the pagans&#x27; boats were sunk after a month at sea. Some historians have debated whether this was at Swanwick in Hampshire, or a coastal settlement called Sanewick in Dorset. Some accounts indicate that the pagans, who were Danish, lost some 120 vessels at Swanwick.

The Post Office Directory of 1855 listed Swanwick as a hamlet within the parish of Titchfield (itself the largest parish in the county of Hampshire at the time). The hamlet had an independent chapel and four residents were listed: a gentleman by the name of William B Gates, a farmer (John Crosskey), a blacksmith (Richard Hewett) and a grocer (Thomas Privett).

Around the beginning of the 20th century the area around Swanwick was noted for its strawberry beds. Strawberry farming remained a feature of the area, and in 1961 strawberries from Swanwick were being cooled immediately after picking as an experimental way of retaining quality and freshness for longer. Swanwick&#x27;s cooled strawberries were being transported to markets as far away as Leeds, Manchester and Glasgow.

The air traffic area control centre at Swanwick was brought into operation in 2002. A control centre for London City Airport is being added with a scheduled completion in 2018. The decision has been taken to relocate the control tower to a site away utilising three cable links providing live video will be a UK first by replacing air traffic controllers with a remotely operated digital system. It will be tested for a year before becoming operational in 2019.

==Landmarks==
The area houses Bursledon Brickworks Museum and Swanwick Lakes Nature Reserve. The Brickworks Museum, also known as &#x27;Bursledon Brickworks&#x27;, is a volunteer-run museum; it is purportedly the UK&#x27;s sole surviving Victorian steam-driven brickworks. The nature reserve is an area of about 80 acres, that was formed from clay pit excavations. Owned by NATS, the site is managed by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest. Both NATS and the Nature Reserve formed part of the original brickworks.

<doc id="1208678" wikidata="Q5178219" url="?curid=1208678" title="Court Circular">
<text>The Court Circular is the official record that lists the engagements carried out by the monarch of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms; the royal family; and appointments to their staff and to the court. It is issued by St James&#x27;s Palace and printed a day in arrears at the back of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspapers. An archive of the circular since 1997 is provided on the British monarchy&#x27;s website.

The circular is traditionally written in very formal language, and describes persons with their official styles and titles at all times (Michael Ancram, for instance, was referred to as &quot;the Marquess of Lothian MP&quot; from 2004 to 2010). There has, however, been some modernisation of the writing style in recent years.

==History==
The Court Circular was established in 1803 by King George III, who had become frustrated at inaccurate reporting of royal events by the national press. He arranged for a daily report to be circulated to the press, listing the sovereign&#x27;s official engagements.

Until the 1960s, the Circular as printed in &quot;The Times&quot; and elsewhere would record the movements of members of the upper levels of society even if they were not part of the royal family and were not acting on its behalf.

==Structure==
The Court Circular follows royal protocols strictly. Announcements in the circular are listed by the official residences of those being reported on, in order of precedence. Only engagements which are carried out by the King (or in the UK on the King&#x27;s behalf) are listed. Certain engagements carried out in the UK by persons not of the King&#x27;s family but on his behalf are also listed.

==Present day==
Today, the following members of the Royal Family are listed in the Court Circular:
Although the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh do not reside permanently at Buckingham Palace, their offices are based there, and they have use of apartments at the palace as a London residence.

Prince William began carrying out royal duties in July 2005, and was listed for the first time in his own right on 2 July for representing the Queen at a war memorial service in New Zealand.

Since they stepped back as senior members of the Royal Family and emigrated to the United States of America, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not carry out official royal engagements and do not appear in the Court Circular, unless attending an important royal function with other members of the Royal Family.

The Duke of York also does not carry out official royal engagements and therefore does not appear in the Court Circular (unless attending an important royal function with other members of the Royal Family) after he stepped down from public duties in November 2019 following intense negative reaction to a BBC television interview he gave regarding allegations of sexual abuse, which he denies. 

Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie do not carry out official royal engagements and do not appear on the Court Circular, except when attending an important royal function with other members of the Royal Family.

Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence is occasionally listed as accompanying his wife, the Princess Royal, on visits overseas and within the United Kingdom. He was styled as Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence, until 2011. Now he is styled as Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, with Vice-Admiral occasionally hyphenated.

The Duchess of Kent stepped back from royal duties in 1996 and only appears in the Court Circular when attending an important royal function with other members of the Royal Family.

Prince and Princess Michael of Kent only appear in the Court Circular when attending an important royal function as they do not carry out official royal engagements on behalf of the King.

===Joint engagements===
When Royals undertake joint engagements, it is listed under the section of the Royal with the higher precedence. They are referred to as &quot;X and Y&quot; (in order of precedence), then &quot;Their Majesties,&quot; &quot;Their Royal Highnesses,&quot; or, &quot;His/Her Majesty and His/Her Royal Highness.&quot;

==Commonwealth realms==
When the King is visiting one of the Commonwealth realms, the relevant Government House or hotel where he is staying is listed in the Court Circular as his residence. This differs from state visits to foreign countries where either the official residence of the foreign Head of State, or whichever hotel the King is staying at, or simply Buckingham Palace is listed.

When other members of the Royal Family visit one of the realms, their UK principal residence is listed.

There is no separate Court Circular for any of the Commonwealth realms other than the UK. The Court Circular only lists engagements carried out by the King, and not engagements carried out by others acting on his behalf outside the UK, for example by vice-regal officers such as governors or governors-general.

==Events commonly listed in the Court Circular==
* Investitures by the King, the Prince of Wales or the Princess Royal
* Privy council meetings attended by the King or a Counsellor of State
* Meetings (described as Audiences) typically between the King and either: the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord President of the Council or the First Minister of Scotland
* Royal engagements in the UK or abroad including the attendance of His Majesty&#x27;s Lord-Lieutenants or their deputies, the personal representatives of the King throughout the Isles and overseas
* Departures of members of the Royal Family from the UK to attend events abroad
* Engagements of the Chief of the Diplomatic Corps on behalf of the King (usually the bidding of farewell to departing ambassadors/high commissioners)
* Attendance of representatives of the Royal Family at memorial services

<doc id="1208682" wikidata="Q7494666" url="?curid=1208682" title="Sherard Vines">
<text>Walter Sherard Vines (1890–1974), known as Sherard Vines, was an English author and academic. He began publishing poetry in the 1910s, then in the 1920s spent five years teaching at Keio University in Tokyo, Japan. While in Japan and after his return to England, where he took up a post at University College Hull, he continued to publish poetry, fiction and criticism. His works include &quot;The Course of English Classicism from the Tudor to Victorian Age&quot; (1930), a study of classicism in British art; &quot;Yofuku, or, Japan in Trousers&quot; (1931), a travel book about his experiences in Japan which was critical of aspects of Japanese culture; and &quot;A Hundred Years of English Literature&quot; (1959), a survey of the literature of Britain, the British Empire and the United States.

==Early life and career==
Sherard Vines was born in Oxford in 1890. His father, Sydney Howard Vines, was Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford and named his son after William Sherard. He attended Magdalen College School and New College, Oxford. His tutor at Oxford was the literary scholar George Stuart Gordon.

From 1910 to 1914 he was editor of &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;, in which he also published his own work. He held an academic position at Belfast University until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. He served in the Highland Light Infantry until 1917, when he was wounded and forced to return to civilian life. While in France, he had married a 21-year-old Salvadorean-born Frenchwoman, Helene Ernestine Dreyfus. She joined him in England, and gave birth to a daughter, Jeannine in 1922.

His collection &quot;The Two Worlds&quot; was reviewed in 1917 in &quot;Poetry&quot;, where it was described as an uneven work in which &quot;it would seem as though the author, in advancing, grew bolder in thought, more daring as to form, casting aside tritenesses and careless rhymes that mar the first part of the work.&quot; In the following years Vines was associated with the Bloomsbury Group and poems of his were included in the Sitwells&#x27; &quot;Wheels&quot; anthologies between 1917 and 1921. In 1920 he published &quot;The Kaleidoscope: Poems for the People&quot;. Reviewing &quot;The Kaleidoscope&quot; in &quot;Poetry&quot;, Marion Strobel commented that the volume &quot;springs fearlessly from one subject to another&quot; and prefers &quot;a harsh simplicity&quot; to &quot;sensuous cadences&quot;or &quot;beauty of wording&quot;.

==Japan==
Starting in 1923, Vines taught for five years at Keio University in Tokyo. He was invited to Keio by Junzaburō Nishiwaki, whom he had met in England and who later translated some of his works into Japanese. Vines&#x27; arrival in Japan was simultaneous with that of fellow English poet Edmund Blunden, who taught at the Imperial University of Tokyo. In 1924 and 1925 Vines contributed short stories to Blunden&#x27;s &quot;Oriental Literary Times&quot;. These included the semi-autobiographical &quot;Also Ran&quot;, about an obscure author denied the success he believes he deserves. In 1925 he published a critical biography of the Japanese author Yone Noguchi. From 1925 to 1927 he was a tutor to Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu.

Another poetry collection, &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, was published in 1926. A reviewer for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; wrote of &quot;The Pyramid&quot;: &quot;[Vines&#x27;] despair is significant because it is so intellectually positive ... His verse is remarkable for the piercing violence with which it expresses the disenchantment of one for whom the world has become divested of value.&quot; &quot;Movements in Modern English Poetry and Prose&quot;, composed mostly of lectures Vines had given and written with Japanese students in mind, was published in 1927. A review in &quot;The Criterion&quot; described the book as &quot;not only up-to-date and impartial, but also full of acute perceptions and judgments.&quot; While in Japan he also became friends with the South African author William Plomer, who spent the years 1926–29 there and described Vines as &quot;a poet of distinction&quot;, albeit &quot;neglected ... by a reading public too easily hypnotized by the parrot-like repetition of names and too incurious to find things out for itself&quot;.

==Return to Europe==
Vines returned to Europe in 1928 to take up a position as Professor of English at University College Hull. That year he published a further volume of poetry, &quot;Triforium&quot;, which featured works that had previously appeared in the Japanese literary magazine &quot;Mita Bungaku&quot;. His novel &quot;Humours Unreconciled: A Tale of Modern Japan&quot;, published in 1928, satirises the expatriate community in Tokyo in the 1920s and comments on the perceived prevalence of suicide in Japan through the tale of an extramarital affair and a murder misrepresented as a suicide. &quot;The Course of English Classicism from the Tudor to Victorian Age&quot;, a critical study, was published in 1930. The book sought to trace the growth of classicism in British art beginning in the Tudor period. George Orwell, reviewing the book in the &quot;New Adelphi&quot;, noted that Vines viewed poetry as &quot;a thing of wit, grandeur and good sense, not of &#x27;magic&#x27; and seductive sounds&quot;, and praised Vines&#x27; &quot;admirable account of the main drift of classicism&quot;. A reviewer in &quot;The Review of English Studies&quot; described it as &quot;a very stimulating and provocative book&quot; which would encourage a reconsideration of Augustan literature. At Hull he was a colleague, friend and neighbour of the economist Eric Roll. Vines&#x27; students at Hull included Harold Andrew Mason. In 1930 Vines he married his second wife, Agnes Rennie Cumming; their daughter, Rennie J. Vines, was born in 1933.

His travel book &quot;Yofuku, or, Japan in Trousers&quot; was published in 1931 and overlaps to a degree with &quot;Humours Unreconciled&quot;. It contains numerous references to his time at Keio and discussion of the perceived eccentricities of Japanese society, customs and cuisine. Vines described the typical Japanese student as &quot;personally as a rule most charming, and sometimes a trifle pathetic&quot;, and noted divergent attitudes among Japanese people toward foreigners. In the book Vines also sought to establish connections between features of Japanese life and the Japanese climate and cuisine. William Snell has argued that &quot;Yofuku&quot; portrays Japan in a less positive light than &quot;Humours Unreconciled&quot;, and reflects Vines&#x27; &quot;particularly jaundiced view of [Japan] and its people&quot;. A reviewer in &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot; criticised Vines&#x27; focus on the aspects of Japanese life he found less pleasant, and asserted that &quot;the informed reader, particularly one who has lived in Japan,&quot; would find it incomplete and one-sided, concluding &quot;it is hard to imagine any considerable public for the book or any way in which that public could be served by its appearance.&quot;

&quot;Return, Belphegor!&quot;, a fantasy novel about the devil, was published in 1932. &quot;Georgian Satirists&quot; was published in 1934. In 1941 &quot;Green to Amber&quot;, a novel about English society in the late 1930s, was published. In 1950 Vines published &quot;A Hundred Years of English Literature&quot;, a survey of literature produced in the United Kingdom, United States and British Empire from around 1830. Reviewing it for &quot;Books Abroad&quot;, John Paul Pritchard described Vines as &quot;a staunch defender of the Victorians&quot; and noted the book&#x27;s incomplete coverage of American literature. Robert Withington, reviewing the book in the &quot;CEA Critic&quot;, likewise noted certain omissions and argued that much of the book&#x27;s material would be too obscure for students and too contentious and incomplete for academics. Vines remained at Hull until his retirement in 1952, and died in 1974.

<doc id="1208683" wikidata="Q2619711" url="?curid=1208683" title="Incest pornography">
<text>Incest pornography is a genre of pornography involving the depiction of sexual activity between relatives. Incest pornography can feature actual relatives, but the main type of this pornography is fauxcest, which features non-related actors to suggest family relationship. This genre includes characters with various levels of kinship, including siblings, first cousins, aunts, uncles, parent(s), offspring, nieces and nephews. In many countries, incest pornography amounts to illegal pornography.

== History and legality ==
There is a substantial amount of incest pornography on the Internet, leading some to argue it may legitimize or encourage real-life incest. Jeffrey Masson has even argued that incest porn is &quot;the very of pornography — its prototypical form.&quot;

== Twincest and sibcest porn ==
Going back at least as far as the Christy twins in the 1970s, depictions of incest, and particularly incest between twins, have been a feature of gay pornography. Though the Christy twins may have been unrelated but similar-looking men and some twins have appeared together in scenes without substantial contact between them, some genuine twins have performed sexual acts on each other. It is illegal in many jurisdictions. For example, in Australia it is rated &quot;Refused Classification&quot; (RC).

The 1999 William Higgins production &quot;Double Czech&quot; included actual sex between the Bartok twins, as did the 2009 sequel between the Richter twins. Another pair of Czech twins, Elijah and Milo Peters, who work together condomless for both oral and anal sex for studio Bel Ami. As of 2010, were reported to live together as a monogamous couple outside of their porn careers and want to continue working together for another 50 years. Some scenes with the Peters twins together have needed to be re-edited in order to gain approval from film classification censors for distribution in markets including the United Kingdom and the United States.

== Fauxcest ==
Fauxcest refers to pornographic or erotic depictions of incest by actors who are merely pretending to be related but in actuality have no biological relation. The term &quot;fauxcest&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;faux&quot; and &quot;incest&quot;, sometimes transcribed as &quot;faux-incest&quot; and sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;family roleplay&quot; or &quot;fictional incest&quot;. Besides women, its primary consumers are couples and millennials. According to one pornographic film director, part of the appeal of the fauxcest genre is a desire by porn consumers to view taboo and controversial content.
Arguably the most famous example of the genre is the &quot;Taboo&quot; film series of the 1980s. The first film in this series, which starred Kay Parker, was released in 1980. It spawned numerous sequels, several of which won adult film awards.
As of 2016, the genre had been growing in popularity at a rate of 1000% since 2011 and 178% since 2014, a spike that some industry professionals have attributed to female porn consumers who largely seek a content that is accompanied by a narrative. Variations of pretend relationships include siblings, mom–son, dad–daughter, step-relatives and various others.

One of the reasons behind a trend towards pseudoincest over actual blood-relation incest within fiction is the bannable nature of consanguineal forms since some publishers will refuse to publish such content.

On GameLink, one in ten purchases had a fauxcestual theme, and one sociologist has said the theme has become more mainstream as evidenced by its depiction on fantasy novel and television series such as &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Pseudo-incest fictional books began to increase in popularity in the year 2011. Some self-publishing companies are welcoming towards content that has pseudo-incestual themes.

<doc id="1208693" wikidata="Q3756613" url="?curid=1208693" title="Suwannee bass">
<text>The Suwannee bass (Micropterus notius) is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of order Centrarchiformes. One of the black basses, This species is native to just two river systems in Florida and Georgia, although it has been introduced elsewhere.

==Description==

The Suwannee bass is a rather small species compared to its congeners and has a deep body with a large mouth in which the maxilla is placed beneath the eye and there is a circular patch of teeth on the tongue. The base of the soft part of the dorsal fin and the anal fin are scaled. They are mostly brown in colour marked with a dozen olive blotches on the flanks. These blotches are wider than the gaps between them towards the head but they merge towards the tail eventually creating a horizontal band near the caudal peduncle. There is a large blotch at the base of the caudal fin which has a pale margin, this is more obvious in young fish which also show bold mottling on the soft part of the dorsal fin, the anal fin and the caudal fin. In the breeding season, the adults show a turquoise colouration on the cheek, breast and belly. This species attains a maximum total length of although a more usual total length would be around and the maximum published weight is .

==Distribution==
The Suwannee bass is endemic to the southeastern United States where it is native to the lower Suwannee and Ochlockonee River systems in Florida and a small part of Georgia. It has been introduced into the St. Marks River and the Wacissa River in Florida.

==Habitat and biology==
The Suwannee bass is found in fast-moving shallow areas of rivers, known as shoals, over limestone, this is frequently covered in sand. They usually prefer neutral or basic waters, originating in springs emerging from aquifers in the limestone. They are uncommon in the lower parts of the Suwannee River where there is a tidal influence, but are absent from the upper reaches which are dominated by acidic waters draining from the Okefenokee Swamp. This species has a diet which is dominated by crayfish, although they will eat other invertebrates and fishes. In the lower, tidal reaches of the Suwannee River, the blue crab is taken by this species. The spawning season runs from February to May, peaking in April and May, when the water temperature reaches The eggs are laid in circular depressions excavated near the edges of the streams where they are fertilised by the male. The male then guards the eggs up to the point of hatching. Females have a faster growth rate and attain larger sizes than the males, the males rarely attain lengths greater than . The females can have a life span of up to 12 years although in the males it is 9 years.

==Taxonomy==
The Suwannee bass was first formally described by Reeve Maclaren Bailey and Carl Leavitt Hubbs in 1949 with the type locality given as Head of Ichetucknee Springs at Lead, Columbia County, Florida.

== Relationship with humans ==
While not as well known as other black basses, &quot;M. notius&quot; is also fished for sport. The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at caught from the Suwannee River in 1985.

<text>Tytherington is an area in the north of Macclesfield, in the Cheshire East district, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It comprises a large residential housing estate and has a church, Tytherington Family Worship Church, an academy school, Tytherington School and a golf club. Tytherington Wood forms part of Macclesfield Riverside Park. Tytherington Business Park lies to the north-east.

Manchester Road divides the housing estate, the &quot;Dorchester Way area&quot; being to the west and &quot;Rugby Drive area&quot; to the east. Rugby Drive derives its name from Macclesfield Rugby Club, since relocated to Prestbury. The rugby pitch remains but is used predominantly for football.

Tytherington has become a relatively affluent residential area, the average house price being around £320,000.

== Tytherington Hall ==
Tytherington Hall (or Tytherington House) was a stone mansion built by the wife of William Brocklehurst in the 19th century as a surprise for her husband. Brocklehurst&#x27;s wife led him to the gates to the driveway from where Brocklehurst &quot;refused to go any further&quot;. The building later became the residence of Mr Henry Charlton, a philanthropic cotton merchant from Manchester. Miss Salt from Buxton bought the house in the early 20th century and named it &#x27;Marlborough College for Girls&#x27;.

During World War II, American soldiers were billeted in the Hall and in Nissen huts dotted around the grounds. In the times of the occupation by the Americans and other troops the Hall fell into disrepair and was demolished in the 1960s to make way for Marlborough Primary School and the Tytherington housing estate.

== History ==
Tytherington was formerly a township in the parish of Prestbury, in 1866 Tytherington became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished and merged with Macclesfield and Bollington. In 1931 the parish had a population of 318.

Tytherington was in Macclesfield Rural District until 1936 when it became part of the Municipal Borough of Macclesfield, from 1974 to 2009 it was in Macclesfield non-metropolitan district.

<text>Tytherington is a village in the civil parish of Tytherington and Itchington, in the South Gloucestershire district, in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England, situated south east of Thornbury. The parish population taken at the 2011 census was 666. On 1 April 2023 the parish was renamed from &quot;Tytherington&quot; to &quot;Tytherington and Itchington&quot;.

To the west of the village is Tytherington Quarry, a limestone quarry incorporating 2 active workings, operated by Hanson plc, and a disused working now designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The former Yate to Thornbury railway branch line passes through the south of the village, with two bridges in the village and a tank engine near the quarry entrance as reminders of the railway. The line now ends at the quarry and is used for the transport of stone, but used to continue through a tunnel under the A38, to Thornbury. Tytherington had its own small station on the single track line: it opened in 1872 and closed to passengers in 1944. The M5 motorway runs along the north west fringe of the village.

In the village there is a park, a former primary school (now used as the village hall), the Swan public house, a community shop, a church and a Baptist chapel. The community shop has a Post Office branch which has now reopened after being under threat of closure.

To the north-east of the village stands Tytherington Hill (), with views east to the Cotswold Edge, and to the north are Cutts Heath and Milbury Heath. 
To the south of Tytherington is the hamlet of Itchington which includes an old lime works, which is now at the centre of a small development of 18 new homes.

<text>The Corridor First type of railway coach was one of the standard mid-20th century designs; coded &#x27;FK&#x27; by the LNER and BR, and &#x27;CL&#x27; by the LMS. The layout of the coach was a number of compartments, all of which were first class, linked by a side corridor.
The British Railways produced versions (of Mark 1 and Mark 2 variations up to Mark 2D inclusive) were numbered in the 13xxx series. The prototype Mark 2 carriage, number 13252, was of FK design. It is now preserved at the Mid-Norfolk Railway, having been preserved by (now formerly part of) the National Collection.

A number of the Mark 2A/2B/2C carriages were declassified in 1985 to become Standard Corridors (coded SK). They were renumbered from 13xxx to 19xxx, putting them after the end of the &#x27;Mark 1&#x27; range (19452–19560).

No carriages of this type are still in daily use on the main line network, since open saloon carriages are now preferred by operating companies. However, some electric multiple units based on British Rail coaches have first class compartments. As of 22 May 2010 there are no more Mark 1-based class units in use (the last journey was on the train which left on Saturday 22 May 2010 at 22:14 BST). Hastings Diesels Limited has some such coaches forming part of their preserved main line Class 201/202 and many FKs still operate in charter trains, and they remain popular on preserved railway lines.

<text>Look at Me () is a 2004 French drama-comedy film directed by Agnès Jaoui. It won the Best Screenplay award at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The film features a clip from the 1948 film &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot;.

==Plot==
Lolita Cassard lacks confidence and self-esteem because she doesn&#x27;t look like the women who fill the pages of fashion magazines. Her father, Étienne Cassard, is a respected novelist, but rarely considers the feelings of others, only thinking of himself and worrying about aging. Pierre Millet, a younger writer, doubts he will ever be successful. Meanwhile, Sylvia Millet, a singing teacher, believes in her husband&#x27;s talent, but doubts her own and that of her student, Lolita. When Sylvia discovers that Lolita is the daughter of Étienne, an author she admires, she befriends Lolita in order to gain access to Étienne for her husband&#x27;s sake. Lolita does not see that Sylvia is just another person being generous to her because her father is famous. She begins to confide in Sylvia about her father, love life, and self-confidence issues. Sylvia takes a liking to Lolita and begins to see Étienne for the man he really is. Sébastien, a young journalist, befriends Lolita. He takes a liking to her, but she shows no interest, infatuated with another boy, Mathieu. Mathieu is interested in Lolita only because of her father and mistreats her. Lolita assumes the same of Sébastien and does not realize that he likes her for herself. After a crazy weekend at Étienne&#x27;s cottage, Sylvia leaves Pierre because he has become like Étienne, Lolita realizes Sébastien has honest intentions, and Étienne is repeatedly reminded that he is an indifferent father to Lolita.

<text>Identity cleansing is defined as &quot;confiscation of personal identification, passports, and other such documents in order to make it difficult or impossible for those driven out to return&quot;.

==Kosovo War==
During the Kosovo War in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), expelled Kosovo Albanians were systematically stripped of identity and property documents including passports, land titles, vehicle registration plates, identity cards and other documents. In conjunction with the policy of expelling Kosovo Albanians from the province, Yugoslav Army would confiscate all documents that indicated the identity of those being expelled. 
Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) reports that nearly 60% of respondents to its survey observed the Yugoslav Army removing or destroying personal identification documents. Human Rights Watch (HRW) also documented the common practice of &quot;identity cleansing&quot;; refugees expelled toward Albania were frequently stripped of their identity documents and forced to remove the registration plates from their vehicles. This criminal practice suggesting the government was trying to block their return.

In addition to confiscating the relevant documents from their holders, efforts were also made to destroy any actual birth certificate as well as other archives which were maintained by governmental agencies, so as to make the &quot;cleansing&quot; complete, which sometimes was being referred to as &quot;archival cleansing&quot;.

This practice received worldwide condemnation, and evidence of it has been brought at the war crimes trials held at The Hague after the situation in Kosovo was stabilized following the NATO bombing of the Yugoslavia and the subsequent collapse of its nationalist government in October 2000. Despite difficulties due to &quot;identity cleansing&quot;, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) registered 1.3 million voters until the October 2002 municipal elections.

<text>William Estabrook Chancellor (September 25, 1867 – February 12, 1963) was an American academic and writer. An opponent of the 1920 Republican presidential candidate, Warren G. Harding, Chancellor gained notoriety when he allegedly wrote a study of Harding&#x27;s ancestry just before the election, asserting that Harding had an African-American ancestor. Chancellor denied authorship, and it has never been proved. Two years later, a biography of Harding was published under Chancellor&#x27;s name, but Chancellor denied authorship of that as well.

William Estabrook Chancellor was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1867. After graduating in 1889 from Amherst College, where he was Phi Beta Kappa, editor of the college newspaper and class orator, he went into teaching. In 1906, while serving as superintendent of schools of Paterson, New Jersey, he was appointed superintendent of schools in Washington, D.C. He also served as superintendent of schools in Bloomfield, New Jersey; and Norwalk, Connecticut. He wrote prolifically, publishing around 40 books and hundreds of articles between 1904 and 1920. He married into the family of Harriet Beecher Stowe. He was a Democrat. From 1914 to 1920, he was a professor of economics, politics, and social science at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio.

In 1920, Chancellor, a student of the American presidency who had authored &quot;Our presidents and their Office,&quot; helped gather biographical information on Republican presidential candidate Warren G. Harding. His investigations included Harding&#x27;s racial lineage. Chancellor concluded that Harding had some black ancestry. Controversy erupted around Professor Chancellor when some pamphlets were published about Harding&#x27;s ancestry, which Chancellor was accused of writing even though he denied it. The scandal cost him his professorship at the College of Wooster, and, subjected to continuing harassment, he fled to Canada in 1921.

In 1927 Chancellor was hired by the Xavier University, in Cincinnati, where he taught until his retirement. Chancellor continued to teach, lecture, and publish for the remainder of his life. He died in Wooster in 1963, aged 95.

== Research on Harding ==
Chancellor&#x27;s research of Harding&#x27;s lineage was based on affidavits provided by aged Crawford County, Ohio, residents asserting that Harding was of mixed race. Chancellor&#x27;s research indicated that Harding had a great-grandmother, Elizabeth Madison, who was black. The affidavits by elderly residents in Galion, Ohio, served as the basis for a book later attributed to Chancellor.
There was no birth record for Harding, who was born in 1865 near Corsica (now Blooming Grove), Ohio; Ohio did not mandate the recording of births until 1867. Further, there were no court records, deeds, or other legal documents that could prove whether Harding was of mixed race. U.S. census records prior to 1850 did not provide a complete enumeration by name and race of all people in a household. Instead, 1840 and earlier census records only listed the name of the head of household and counted by &quot;hash-mark&quot; the age-group and sex of other persons living with that head of household.

Chancellor allegedly wrote two pamphlets about Harding&#x27;s racial lineage prior to the 1920 presidential election, unleashing a major scandal by asserting that Harding was of mixed-race descent. Chancellor denied writing the pamphlets, but he refused to sign a statement saying that he believed Harding to be all white, because he considered that to be a lie. Four days before the election, the college dismissed him from his professorship. Copies of the pamphlets were confiscated by Federal agents and destroyed; only five are thought to be in existence, three of which are owned by rare book collectors, the other two owned by museums.

After Harding was elected president, Chancellor did additional research, with the aim of publishing a biography of Harding. The book was to include not only Chancellor&#x27;s findings about Harding&#x27;s lineage, but also extended to corruption in the nominating process, and, later, in the formation of Harding&#x27;s administration. He singled out oil companies in particular. Many of Chancellor&#x27;s allegations of corruption were later borne out by the Teapot Dome scandal. Early in 1921, Harding learned of Chancellor&#x27;s planned book and sent Federal agents to destroy the manuscript. Federal agents also monitored Chancellor. Facing ongoing harassment and unable to do research or find another teaching position, he went to Canada in 1921, where he remained until 1922.

In the spring of 1922, Chancellor was in Dayton, Ohio (his hometown as well as that of 1920 Democratic presidential candidate and prominent newspaper publisher James Cox) long enough allegedly to publish a biography of Warren Harding. The author of the book, which was titled &quot;Warren Gamaliel Harding, President of the United States,&quot; is listed as William Estabrook Chancellor. In the book, the race rumors are developed at great length. Some additional research was also included, such as the first notice of Harding&#x27;s poor cardiovascular health. (Harding died of cardiovascular disease in 1923, before completing his term in office.) Chancellor gave several interviews to journalists during subsequent years in which he denied writing either the book or the pamphlets. He never suggested who might have been responsible.

Research by Ohio author John A. Murphy, published in 2000 under the title &quot;The Indictment&quot; led Murphy to conclude that, although some of Chancellor&#x27;s research was included in the 1922 biography, Chancellor himself did not write the book, nor did he publish anything on Harding&#x27;s background. It appeared that Chancellor was falsely accused with its publication. After the 1922 biography of Harding was published, a statewide organization sold the book door-to-door during the midterm election year.

Based on details within John A. Murphy&#x27;s book and other existing bibliographical materials, the electronic/audio book entitled &quot;The Chancellor Affair: The FBI File: The True Story about How President Warren G. Harding Abused Power in the White House and Silenced His Most Vocal Critic&quot; was published in 2017 on Amazon. The book told the complete account of the Chancellor affair, and included a detailed family perspective as its author was a family descendant of Chancellor.

== Evaluation ==
In 2015, press reports indicated that DNA analysis showed Harding had no recent black ancestors.

According to Harding biographer John W. Dean, Chancellor&#x27;s analyses were partly based on a story spread by Amos Kling, Harding&#x27;s father-in-law, who opposed him politically. Dean, who lived in Marion, Ohio, as a teenager, claimed that Kling spread the story as retribution for positions taken by Harding in his newspaper &quot;The Marion Star&quot;. Dean characterized Chancellor as racist.

Following Chancellor&#x27;s death, the author Francis Russell attempted to determine whether Harding was of mixed race. His book, &quot;The Shadow of Blooming Grove&quot;, published in 1968, noted that he was unable to substantiate Chancellor&#x27;s conclusions beyond circumstantial evidence. Further discussion of Chancellor&#x27;s research appears in the book &quot;The Strange Deaths of President Harding&quot; by Robert H. Ferrell, published in 1996. (This work should not be confused with the 1930 book by Gaston Means, &quot;The Strange Death of President Harding&quot;, which uses the singular &quot;Death&quot;). Russell wrote, &quot;To anyone who tracks it down today, [the book attributed to Chancellor] comes across as a laughable partisan screed, an amalgam of bizarre racial theories, outlandish stereotypes and cheap political insults. But it also contains a remarkable trove of social knowledge—the kind of community gossip and oral tradition that rarely appears in official records but often provides clues to richer truths.&quot;

<text>Yigael Yadin ( ; 20 March 1917 – 28 June 1984) was an Israeli archeologist, soldier and politician. He was the second Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces and Deputy Prime Minister from 1977 to 1981.

==Biography==
Yigael Sukenik (later Yadin) was born in Ottoman Palestine to archaeologist Eleazar Sukenik and his wife Hasya Sukenik-Feinsold, a teacher and women&#x27;s rights activist.

==Military career==
He joined the Haganah at age 15, and served in a variety of different capacities. In 1946, he left the Haganah following an argument with its commander Yitzhak Sadeh over the inclusion of a machine gun as part of standard squad equipment.

In 1948, shortly before the State of Israel declared its independence, Yadin, interrupted his university studies to return to active service. He served as Israel&#x27;s Head of Operations during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and was responsible for many of the key decisions made during the course of that war. In April, probably under the authorization of Ben-Gurion, he oversaw the secret biological warfare operation, &quot;Cast Thy Bread,&quot; in a campaign designed to poison the wells of Palestinian villages with bacteria, and prevent the return of the evicted. In June 1948 he threatened to resign during the Generals&#x27; Revolt during which he accused Ben-Gurion of attempting &quot;to transform the army as a whole into an army of one political party (Mapai)&quot;.

Yadin was appointed Chief of Staff of the IDF on 9 November 1949, following the resignation of Yaakov Dori, and served in that capacity for three years. He resigned on 7 December 1952, over disagreements with then prime minister and defense minister David Ben-Gurion about cuts to the military budget, which he argued should be at least one third of the national budget. By age thirty-five, he had completed his military career.

==Archaeology career==

Upon leaving the military, he devoted himself to research and began his life&#x27;s work in archaeology. In 1956 he received the Israel Prize in Jewish studies, for his doctoral thesis on the translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. His father had bought three of the seven scrolls discovered in 1947 by a Bedouin goat-herd, and he had bought the other four in New York in 1954. 

As an archeologist, he excavated some of the most important sites in the region, including the Qumran Caves, Masada, Hazor, Tel Megiddo and caves in the Judean Desert where artifacts from the Bar Kokhba revolt were found. In 1960 he initiated scholarly archeological exploration of caves south of Ein Gedi, an enterprise approved by Ben-Gurion in which Israel Defense Forces rendered considerable support. He wrote about the expedition and its findings in his 1971 book &quot;Bar-Kokhba: The Rediscovery of the Legendary Hero of the Second Jewish Revolt against Rome&quot;. Yadin considered the Solomonic Gate at Tel Gezer to be the highpoint of his career. He was sometimes forced to deal with the theft of important artifacts, occasionally by prominent political and military figures. In one instance, where the thefts were commonly attributed to the famous one-eyed general Moshe Dayan, he remarked: &quot;I know who did it, and I am not going to say who it is, but if I catch him, I&#x27;ll poke out his other eye, too.&quot;

Even as an archaeologist, Yadin never completely abandoned public life. On the eve of the Six-Day War, he served as a military adviser to prime minister Levi Eshkol, and following the Yom Kippur War, he was a member of the Agranat Commission that investigated the actions that led to the war.

==Political career==
In 1976 Yadin formed the Democratic Movement for Change, commonly known by its Hebrew acronym &quot;Dash&quot;, together with Professor Amnon Rubinstein, Shmuel Tamir, Meir Amit, Meir Zorea, and many other prominent public figures. The new party seemed to be an ideal solution for many Israelis who were fed up with alleged corruption in the Labor Alignment (the dominant party in Israel from its founding and up to that time), which included the Yadlin affair, the suicide of Housing Minister Avraham Ofer, and Leah Rabin&#x27;s illegal dollar-denominated account in the United States. Furthermore, Dash was a response to the increasing sense of frustration and despair in the aftermath of the 1973 war, and the social and political developments that followed in its wake. Many people regarded Yadin, a warrior and a scholar, as the quintessential prototype of the ideal Israeli, untainted by corruption, who could lead the country on a new path.

In the 1977 elections, which transformed the Israeli political landscape, the new party did remarkably well for its first attempt to enter the Knesset, winning 15 of the 120 seats. As a result of the election, Likud party leader Menachem Begin was initially able to form a coalition without Dash (or parties to its left), significantly lowering the bargaining power of Dash. Dash joined the coalition after a few months. As the new Deputy Prime Minister, Yadin played a pivotal role in many events that took place, particularly the contacts with Egypt, which eventually led to the signing of the Camp David Accords and the peace treaty between Israel and its neighbor. Nevertheless, Dash itself proved to be a failure, and the party broke up into numerous splinter factions; Yadin joined the Democratic Movement, but it too split up and he sat as an independent MK for the remainder of his term. During a cabinet meeting, May 1981, while still Deputy Prime Minister, he accused Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan of &quot;lying to the government&quot; and told Prime Minister Begin &quot;You have lost control of the defence establishment.&quot; He retired from politics in 1981.

Yadin was married to Carmela (née Ruppin), who worked with him throughout his career in translating and editing his books and with whom he had two daughters, Orly and Littal. He died in 1984 from heart attack and was buried in the military cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. The Israeli actor was his brother.

<text>XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a freely available global framework for exchanging business information. XBRL allows the expression of semantics commonly required in business reporting. The standard was originally based on XML, but now additionally supports reports in JSON and CSV formats, as well as the original XML-based syntax. XBRL is also increasingly used in its Inline XBRL variant, which embeds XBRL tags into an HTML document. One common use of XBRL is the exchange of financial information, such as in a company&#x27;s annual financial report. The XBRL standard is developed and published by XBRL International, Inc. (XII).

XBRL is a standards-based way to communicate and exchange business information between business systems. These communications are defined by metadata set out in taxonomies, which capture the definition of individual reporting concepts as well as the relationships between concepts and other semantic meaning. Information being communicated or exchanged is provided within an XBRL instance.

Early users of XBRL included regulators such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS). Common functions in many countries that make use of XBRL include regulators of stock exchanges and securities, banking regulators, business registrars, revenue reporting and tax-filing agencies, and national statistical agencies.

A list of known XBRL projects is published by XBRL International. Within the last ten years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United Kingdom&#x27;s HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and Singapore&#x27;s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), had begun to require companies to use it, and other regulators were following suit. Development of the SEC&#x27;s initial US GAAP Taxonomy was led by XBRL US and was accepted and deployed for use by public companies in 2008 in phases, with the largest filers going first: foreign companies which use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are expected to submit their financial returns to the SEC using XBRL once the IFRS taxonomy has been accepted by the SEC. In the UK in 2011, both HMRC and Companies House accepted XBRL in the iXBRL format. XBRL was adopted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) of India for filing financial and costing information with the Central Government.

== Specification ==
The current version of the base XBRL specification is 2.1, with errata corrections.

The current version of the Inline XBRL specification is 1.1 

Conformance suites are available to test processors of XBRL and Inline XBRL documents.

== XBRL document structure ==
In typical usage, XBRL consists of an &quot;XBRL instance&quot;, containing primarily the business facts being reported, and a collection of taxonomies (called a Discoverable Taxonomy Set (DTS)), which define metadata about these facts, such as what the facts mean and how they relate to one another. XBRL uses XML Schema, XLink, and XPointer standards.

=== XBRL Instance ===
The XBRL instance begins with the &lt;xbrl&gt; root element. There may be more than one XBRL instance embedded in a larger XML document. Xbrl Instance is also known as XBRL file. The XBRL instance itself holds the following information:
* &quot;Business Facts &quot; – facts can be divided into two categories
** &quot;Items&quot; are facts holding a single value. They are represented by a single XML element with the value as its content.
** &quot;Tuples&quot; are facts holding multiple values. They are represented by a single XML element containing nested Items or Tuples.
In the design of XBRL, all Item facts must be assigned a context.
* &quot;Contexts&quot; define the entity, e.g., company or individual, to which the fact applies, the period of time the fact is relevant, and an optional scenario. Date and time information appearing in the period element must conform to ISO 8601. Scenarios provide further contextual information about the facts, such as whether the business values reported are actual, projected, or budgeted.
* &quot;Units&quot; define the units used by numeric or fractional facts within the document, such as USD, shares. XBRL allows more complex units to be defined if necessary. Facts of a monetary nature must use a unit from the ISO 4217 namespace.
* &quot;Footnotes&quot; use XLink to associate one or more facts with some content.
* &quot;References&quot; to XBRL taxonomies, typically through schema references. It is also possible to link directly to a linkbase.

This is an example of a fictitious Dutch company&#x27;s International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) statement instance file :

=== XBRL Taxonomy ===
An XBRL Taxonomy is a collection of taxonomy schemas and linkbases. A taxonomy schema is an XML schema document (file). Linkbases are XML documents (file) which follow the XLink specification. The schema must ultimately extend the XBRL instance schema document and typically extend other published XBRL schemas on the xbrl.org website.

* &quot;Taxonomy schemas&quot; define Item and Tuple &quot;concepts&quot; using &lt;element&gt; elements. Concepts provide names for the fact and indicate whether or not it is a tuple or an item, the data type (such as monetary, numeric, fractional, or textual), and potentially more metadata. Items and Tuples can be regarded as &quot;implementations&quot; of concepts, or specific instances of a concept. A good analogy for those familiar with object oriented programming would be that Concepts are the classes and Items and Tuples are Object instances of those classes. This is the source of the use of the &quot;XBRL instance&quot; terminology. In addition to defining concepts, taxonomy schemas reference linkbase documents. Tuples instances are 1..n relationships with their parents; their metadata is simply the collection of their attributes.
* &quot;Linkbases&quot; are a collection of Links, which themselves are a collection of locators, arcs, and potentially resources. Locators are elements that essentially reference a concept and provide an arbitrary label for it. In turn, arcs are elements indicating that a concept links to another concept by referencing the labels defined by the locators. Some arcs link concepts to other concepts. Other arcs link concepts to resources, the most common of which are human-readable labels for the concepts. The XBRL 2.1 specification defines five different kinds of linkbases.
** &quot;Label Linkbase&quot;
** &quot;Reference Linkbase&quot;
** &quot;Calculation Linkbase&quot;
** &quot;Definition Linkbase&quot;
** &quot;Presentation Linkbase&quot;

====Label Linkbase====
This linkbase provides human readable strings for concepts. Using the label linkbase, multiple languages can be supported, as well as multiple strings within each language.

XBRL aims to become a worldwide standard for electronic business reporting. This requires taxonomies to present business data in many different languages. Therefore, it is important to be able to create an element that is assigned with labels for different languages. There may also be different labels for different purposes. All labels are stored and linked to the elements in a label linkbase.
Elements defined in a schema are built to convey accounting meaning to computers. In order to make it easier for computers to process their names, they have to obey some rules. For example, the use of spaces is not allowed so &#x27;Cash and Cash Equivalents&#x27; would be named &#x27;CashAndCashEquivalents&#x27; . Additionally, big taxonomies such as IFRS obey specific rules of naming and labelling to ensure consistency within the schema. For example, there could be a list of words that are excluded from the names, e.g., :and:, &quot;of&quot; ..., or words that appear only in a particular order (i.e., &#x27;Net&#x27; or &#x27;Total&#x27; at the end of the label after a comma).
In the label linkbase, elements are connected to human readable labels using &quot;concept-label&quot; arcrole.
As mentioned above, elements can be assigned to labels in different languages. An example that describes definitions of labels of the IFRS element AssetsTotal in English, German and Polish is provided below.

&lt;label xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot; 
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/label&quot; 
 xlink:label=&quot;ifrs_AssetsTotal_lbl&quot; 
 xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Assets, Total&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;label xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot; 
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/label&quot; 
 xlink:label=&quot;ifrs_AssetsTotal_lbl&quot; 
 xml:lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Vermögenswerte, Gesamt&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;label xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot; 
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/label&quot; 
 xlink:label=&quot;ifrs_AssetsTotal_lbl&quot; 
 xml:lang=&quot;pl&quot;&gt;Aktywa, Razem&lt;/label&gt;
To distinguish between languages, XBRL uses the XML attribute lang. Taxonomy creators may also define different labels for one element. One of the ideas of XBRL is that the information about the period and currency for which the element is reported is not contained within an element definition but is described by a context in instance documents. In financial reporting on the other hand, many terms express the date for which they are being reported, for instance Property, Plant and Equipment at the beginning of year and Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of year. XBRL allows the creation of different labels depending on the context in which an element will be used.

&lt;label xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot; 
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/label&quot; 
 xlink:label=&quot;ifrs_AssetsTotal_lbl&quot; 
 xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Property, Plant and Equipment, Net&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;label xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot; 
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/periodStartLabel&quot; 
 xlink:label=&quot;ifrs_AssetsTotal_lbl&quot; 
 xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Property, Plant and Equipment, Net, Beginning Balance&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;label xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot;
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/periodEndLabel&quot; 
 xlink:label=&quot;ifrs_AssetsTotal_lbl&quot; 
 xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Property, Plant and Equipment, Net, Ending Balance&lt;/label&gt;

The example above shows how three different labels are assigned to one element by applying different role attributes on labels.

====Reference Linkbase====
This linkbase associates concepts with citations of some body of authoritative literature.

Financial concepts appearing on business reports more often than not stem from regulatory documents issued by authorities. For example, the IFRS Taxonomy describes financial reports prepared based on IFRSs (Bound Volume).
Elements defined by this taxonomy refer to the specific terms and concepts explained in the standards. For this reason, a taxonomy is often provided with a reference linkbase that presents relationships between elements and external regulations or standards (the other solution is to enclose documentation in label linkbase). This helps instance creators and users understand the intended meaning of each element and provides support for its inclusion in the taxonomy.
The reference layer does not contain the full text of the regulations. Instead, it points to source documents by identifying their name and indicating the relevant paragraphs and clauses. This connection is created using &quot;concept-reference&quot; arcrole.
There are several types of references that could be provided for each element.

&lt;reference xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot; 
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef&quot; 
 xlink:label=&quot;CashFlowsFromUsedInOperationsTotal_ref&quot;&gt;
 &lt;ref:Name&gt;IAS&lt;/ref:Name&gt;
 &lt;ref:Number&gt;7&lt;/ref:Number&gt;
 &lt;ref:Paragraph&gt;14&lt;/ref:Paragraph&gt;
&lt;/reference&gt;
&lt;reference xlink:type=&quot;resource&quot; 
 xlink:role=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/measurementRef&quot;
 xlink:label=&quot;CashFlowsFromUsedInOperationsTotal_ref&quot;&gt;
 &lt;ref:Name&gt;IAS&lt;/ref:Name&gt;
 &lt;ref:Number&gt;7&lt;/ref:Number&gt;
 &lt;ref:Paragraph&gt;18&lt;/ref:Paragraph&gt;
 &lt;ref:Subparagraph&gt;a&lt;/ref:Subparagraph&gt;
&lt;/reference&gt;
The example above indicates references for Cash Flow from (Used in) Operations. First, it provides a reference to a document which explains how and where the element should be presented in terms of its placement and labeling. In IAS 7, paragraph 14 we read that the concept Cash Flows from Operating Activities exists and what it is derived from. Second, the measurement reference provides explanations about what determines the value of the element and how it should be calculated. This description can be found in IAS 7 paragraph 18.a.
XBRL also allows an element to be assigned other types of references containing examples, commentaries, etc.

====Calculation Linkbase====
This linkbase associates concepts with other concepts so that values appearing in an instance document may be checked for consistency.

The idea of the calculation linkbase is to improve the quality of an XBRL report. It contains definitions of basic validation rules, which apply to all instance documents referring to a particular taxonomy. A hierarchical calculation linkbase sorts all monetary elements in this way so that lower level elements sum up to or are subtracted from one another so that the upper level concept is the result of these operations.

The sign of the relationship depends on the weight attribute that is assigned to the arc connecting two elements. An example is provided below.
&lt;calculationArc xlink:type=&quot;arc&quot; 
 xlink:arcrole=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/arcrole/summation-item&quot; 
 xlink:from=&quot;GrossProfit&quot; xlink:to=&quot;RevenueTotal&quot; 
 order=&quot;1&quot; weight=&quot;1&quot; use=&quot;optional&quot;/&gt;
&lt;calculationArc xlink:type=&quot;arc&quot;
 xlink:arcrole=&quot;http://www.xbrl.org/2003/arcrole/summation-item&quot;
 xlink:from=&quot;GrossProfit&quot; xlink:to=&quot;CostOfSales&quot; 
 order=&quot;2&quot; weight=&quot;-1&quot; use=&quot;optional&quot;/&gt;
The example shows that there are defined two calculation arcs providing details concerning relations between Gross profit, Revenue and Cost of Sales. In Income Statements, Gross profit is the difference between the other two.
Therefore, we assign weight attribute value to &quot;1&quot; on the arc connecting Gross profit and Revenue and &quot;-1&quot; between Gross profit and Cost of Sales.
The reason why there is a difference between calculation and presentation linkbases, is that the total element that stands for the summation of all others usually appears at the bottom in the financial statements whereas in the calculation linkbase it must be placed as the top concept.

There are two major rules concerning calculation relations in XBRL.
Firstly, we cannot carry out operations on elements that have different values of the periodType attribute. This is often called the cross-context rule and relates to defining some elements as &quot;For period&quot; (duration) and others as &quot;As of date&quot; (instant). For example, concepts that appear on the Balance Sheet are instant: which means that their value is presented for a specified day, while elements in the Income Statement or Statement of Cash Flows are duration: because they represent actions that took place over a period of time. The problem emerges for example in the Statement of Changes in Equity or Movements in Property, Plant and Equipment where instant elements mix with duration. The solution to this problem is a formula linkbase that will provide taxonomy creators with many more functions than just simple addition or subtraction.
Secondly, the double entry accounting rule requires XBRL taxonomy creators to define the credit/debit nature of monetary elements appearing in the Balance Sheets and Income Statements. This rule does not only disallow the addition of elements with opposite balance attributes—they must be subtracted—it also defines whether the numerical value contained within an element should be positive or negative.

====Definition Linkbase====
This linkbase associates concepts with other concepts using a variety of arc roles to express relations such as is-a, whole-part, etc. Arc roles can be created by those who create XBRL taxonomies or commonly used arc roles can be added to the XBRL Link Role Registry (LRR).

The definition linkbase provides taxonomy creators with the opportunity to define different kinds of relations between elements. There are four standard types of relationships supported by the definition linkbase.

The first one is referred to as general-special. It distinguishes between concepts that have more generic or more specific meaning. For example, ZIP code is the US representation of Postal Code which is used worldwide. Therefore, to indicate that connection, taxonomy creators define Postal Code as a general term to which there is more specialised concept ZIP code.

Second available relation type is essence-alias. By using it, taxonomy creators are able to indicate that two concepts have similar meaning. For example, some airlines may want to use the term Planes to describe their main component of their PPE while other would prefer Aircraft. To state that meaning of these two is the same and that they can be used interchangeably, taxonomy creators may connect them using &quot;essence-alias&quot; arcrole.

The third standard type of relation is called requires-element. As its name indicates, taxonomy builders use it to force instance creators to enter the value of one element, if they provide the content of another. For instance, a regulator may want to require disclosures on a particular component of Assets if it appears on the Balance Sheet. In order to achieve that, the definition linkbase defines &quot;requires-element&quot; relationship between them (for example, Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and Property, Plant and Equipment Disclosures).

The fourth relation is similar-tuples. It resembles &quot;essence-alias&quot; relation but is applied for tuples. It connects two tuples that are equivalents in terms of definition (documentation from label linkbase or reference in reference linkbase) but are diverse from XML perspective i.e., do not have identical content models, for example contain different elements. One of the reasons that this type of relation was introduced is the prohibition of schema redefinition which prevents changes in a tuple&#x27;s content model.

====Presentation Linkbase====
This linkbase associates concepts with other concepts so that the resulting relations can guide the creation of a user interface, rendering, or visualization.

Business reports are in general prepared in the form of tables or statements or other structures. The presentation linkbase stores information about relationships between elements in order to properly organize the taxonomy content. This allows the elements to be arranged in a structure that is appropriate to represent the hierarchical relationships in particular business data.
These groupings can be performed in many ways. For example, a typical Balance Sheet contains Assets, Equity and Liabilities. Assets consist of Current Assets and Non-current Assets. Current Assets are split in Inventories, Receivables and so on. The presentation linkbase, using parent-child relations organizes elements in this way and helps users find concepts they are interested in.
The main drawback of a tree-like (hierarchical) structure in a presentation linkbase is that it only allows the presentation of flat lists of elements, while financial statements also contain more sophisticated reports such as Changes in Equity or Movements in Property, Plant and Equipment . The XBRL Consortium is currently working on rendering solutions that would provide for the automatic creation of such reports.

XBRL&#x27;s Global Ledger Framework (XBRL GL) is the only set of taxonomies that is developed and recommended by XBRL International.

== XBRL modules ==
XBRL International has issued and reissued a stability pledge in relation to the core XBRL 2.1 specification. In addition to the core XBRL 2.1 specification, work continues on the development of XBRL modules that define new, compatible functionality.

* XBRL Dimensions – This module has achieved Recommendation status in 2005. A new edition of the Dimensions 1.0 Specification with errata corrections was issued on 7 September 2009. The Dimension 1.0 Specification is an optional extension to the XBRL 2.1 Specification that enriches the rules and procedures for constructing dimensional taxonomies and instance documents. It supports the use of XBRL taxonomy linkbases to define additional, structured contextual information for business facts. Each piece of contextual information is referred to as a &quot;dimension.&quot; The base XBRL specification essentially defines three dimensions: reporting period, reporting entity (i.e.; a company or a division thereof), and a loosely defined reporting scenario, originally intended to distinguish between actual vs. projected facts. Taxonomies using XBRL Dimensions can define new dimensions, specify the valid values (&quot;domains&quot;) for dimensions, designate which dimensions apply to which business concepts through mechanisms called &quot;hypercubes&quot;, and relate other taxonomy metadata (labels, presentation information, etc.) to dimensions.
* XBRL Formula – This module achieved Recommendation status 22 June 2009. The Formula Specification 1.0 supports the creation of expressions (using XPath) that can be applied to XBRL instances to validate its information or to calculate new XBRL facts in a new instance. To see how formula components interrelate, click Interactive diagram of related Formula specifications.
* Inline XBRL (or iXBRL) – This module achieved Recommendation status 20 April 2010. The Inline XBRL Specification defines how XBRL metadata can be embedded within well-formed HTML or XHTML documents, so that data and associated rendering information can be encapsulated within a single document.
* XBRL Versioning – This module achieved Recommendation status 27 February 2013. This specification enables creation of Versioning Report which can be used by the authors of XBRL taxonomies to provide documentation of the changes between two taxonomies. Many large taxonomies (such as the IFRS taxonomy) change every year.
* XBRL Table Linkbase – This module allows taxonomy authors to define tabular reporting templates. The Table Linkbase can be used for presentation of XBRL data, and also for data entry, by allowing software to present a template for completion by the user. The Table Linkbase is well-suited to handling large, highly-dimensional reporting templates such as those used for Solvency II reporting to EIOPA, and COREP and FINREP reporting to the EBA.

== Extensibility ==
Besides the creation of additional modules, XBRL International supports several methods for continuing expansion of shared XBRL functionality.

* Link Role Registry – This registry, hosted at xbrl.org, collects link roles and arc roles to promote reuse across taxonomies.
* Functions Registry – This registry collects XPath functions for reuse in formula linkbases.
* Transformation Rules Registry – This registry collects common transforms used to convert human-readable data in Inline XBRL documents (e.g. &quot;1st January 2016&quot;) into the formats required by XBRL (&quot;2016-01-01&quot;).

== iXBRL ==
iXBRL (Inline XBRL) is a development of XBRL in which the XBRL metadata are embedded in an HTML document, e.g., a published report and accounts. It requires the HTML document to be well-formed but does not otherwise specify the required XML format. Typically, iXBRL is implemented within HTML documents, which are displayed or printed by web browsers without revealing the XBRL metadata inside the document. The specification does, however, provide a normative schema which requires that any schema-valid iXBRL document should be in XHTML format.

Most iXBRL financial reports are produced in one of two ways:
# The system which creates the report formats it directly in iXBRL. In the UK, where all companies are required to file in iXBRL, the main commercial accounting packages all provide iXBRL export of financial reports.
# The financial report is produced as a Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel document, and a &quot;Tagging Program&quot; is used to add the XBRL concept metadata and to export the document as Inline XBRL.

With large and complex financial statements, a single iXBRL file may be too large for a web browser to handle. This happens more often when, as in the UK, the company report, which may contain many graphics, is combined with the accounts in a single iXBRL document. The iXBRL specification allows for a set of iXBRL documents to be treated as a single iXBRL document set.

In the UK, HM Revenue and Customs requires businesses to submit their report and accounts and tax computations in iXBRL format when making their Corporation Tax return. Businesses and their agents can use HMRC&#x27;s Online Filing software to prepare their report and accounts and tax computations in iXBRL format or they can prepare the iXBRL files themselves and submit them to HMRC.

HMRC&#x27;s Online Filing software is an example of a program which generates iXBRL from source data. This uses a series of forms in which the key data (which will appear in XBRL tags) are entered in data entry fields. Additional data (the rest of the report and accounts) are entered in text boxes. The program generates the iXBRL report and accounts in a standard sequence of sections and a standard format. All other formatting of material is lost. While the resulting report and accounts meets HMRC&#x27;s requirements, it is not an attractive document to view or read.

iXBRL is mandated for corporate filings by government agencies in Japan, Denmark and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, Companies House also accepts iXBRL. Although iXBRL is not mandated by Companies House, it makes up the majority of the filings received each year.

Since June 2016 the SEC started allowing firms to file using iXBRL in the required HTML filings. In June 2018, the SEC announced plans to move to iXBRL, removing the requirement to file separate HTML and XBRL documents.

Since January 2021, all EU listed companies that prepare annual financial reports under IFRS have been required to publish these reports in Inline XBRL format, as part of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) initiative.

== History ==
XBRL&#x27;s beginning, in 1998, can be traced to the initial efforts of one person, Charles Hoffman, a Certified Public Accountant from Tacoma, Washington. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) was also instrumental in pulling together what eventually became XBRL International.

The specification went through several versions prior to XBRL v2.1 which was published in 2003.

* 1.0 – Published on July 31, 2000, this version was based on DTDs. It expressed the difference between data exchange in instance documents and metadata exchange in taxonomy documents. Taxonomies were expressed as XML Schema files, but these were not used for instance validation.
* 2.0 – Published December 14, 2001, this version introduced use of XML Schema substitution groups as a way of allowing schema validation of instances. Concept relations were broken out into separate XLink-based linkbases. Context data in the instance was collected into a separate element.
* 2.1 – Published December 31, 2003, this version tightened the definition of terms significantly, allowing for the introduction of a conformance suite.

XBRL v2.1 has remained stable since publication, and has been updated only for errata corrections. The standard has evolved significantly through the development of additional XBRL modules. Details of all versions of the specification and associated modules can be found on the XBRL Specification Subsite.

== Lack of accuracy ==
In April 2009 a study of the North Carolina State University Department of Accounting College of Management evaluated the accuracy of XBRL filings for 22 companies participating in the SEC&#x27;s voluntary filing program in 2006. Results of a comparison of XBRL filings to Forms 10-K revealed multiple errors in signage, amounts, labeling, and classification. The study considers that these errors are serious, since XBRL data are computer-readable and users will not visually recognize the errors, especially when using XBRL analysis software.

A different conclusion was reached by Du et al., 2013 who argued that companies are going through a learning curve and are steadily improving.

In December 2017, Charlie Hoffman stated that there is a 10.2% chance that an XBRL-based public company financial report has errors in its primary financial statements. Hoffman predicts that per the current number of errors and the pace errors are being corrected, within about five years the information quality of XBRL-based public company financial reports will be very good.

Corporate governance is significantly and positively associated with a firm&#x27;s decision to be an early and voluntary filer of financial information in XBRL format.

=== Impact on financial reporting in the European Union ===
On 18 December 2017 European Securities and Markets Authority published the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) setting out the new European Single Electronic Format (ESEF). Under the draft regulation, starting in 2020, financial reports containing IFRS consolidated financial statements shall be labelled with XBRL tags.

<doc id="1208731" wikidata="Q342826" url="?curid=1208731" title="John Aldridge">
<text>John William Aldridge (born 18 September 1958) is a former footballer and manager. Nicknamed &quot;Aldo&quot;, he was a prolific, record-breaking striker. His tally of 329 Football League goals is the sixth-highest in the history of English football.

During his early career, he worked his way up through the lower leagues, playing in every league from the old Fourth Division to the old First Division. Initially signed as a replacement for Ian Rush, Aldridge spent over two successful seasons at Liverpool, winning the league and FA Cup once, and narrowly missing out on a second league title. Aldridge spent two seasons at Real Sociedad, becoming the first non-Basque player to sign for the club in several decades as they abandoned their selective recruitment policy. In 1991, he returned to England to play for Tranmere Rovers, becoming their player-manager in 1996. He retired from playing in 1998 and resigned as manager in 2001 and has not managed since.

A Liverpudlian by birth, he was recruited to play for the Republic of Ireland as part of Jack Charlton&#x27;s &quot;Granny Rule&quot; policy: his great-grandmother was from Athlone, and travelled to Liverpool to settle in the 19th century. His career with Ireland coincided with their most successful period in international football, and he played at two World Cups.

==Club career==

===South Liverpool and Newport County===

Aldridge took a long time to reach the top level of the English game. He began his career in the mid-1970s at non-league South Liverpool, before getting his break in the professional game when, aged 20, he signed for Newport County in the Fourth Division on 2 May 1979 for £3,500.

While at Somerton Park, he played 198 times scoring 87 goals, a goal every games, including seven goals in twelve FA Cup matches. He partnered Tommy Tynan and Dave Gwyther for four years at Somerton Park, helping Newport to promotion from the Fourth Division and Welsh Cup glory in his first season, and to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in his second.

His first season with County, the 1979–80 season, saw him score fourteen goals from 38 games as his side won the Welsh Cup and gained promotion to the Third Division. A year later, he featured in the side that achieved a notable European run. In the league, he scored seven goals in 27 league games. He scored eleven goals in 36 games in the 1981–82 season, but in the 1982–83 season, he did better still with seventeen goals from 41 games as County narrowly missed out on promotion to the second tier.

In the 1983–84 season, with Tynan having departed, Aldridge had scored 26 times by the end of February, and County were still in the Third Division.

===Oxford United===
Alridge was sold to Oxford United on 21 March 1984, when the club was preparing for their Third Division promotion run-in under the management of Jim Smith. He made his debut on 7 April 1984, coming on as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Walsall at Fellows Park. His first goal was in the 5–0 home win against Bolton Wanderers on 20 April 1984.

He was used sparingly in the run-in to the Third Division title but the following season forged a partnership with Billy Hamilton and became the first Second Division player for nineteen years to score 30 goals. His 34 goals (30 in the league) in 1984–85 broke the club&#x27;s goalscoring record for a single season, as Oxford gained promotion to the old First Division for the first time. Aldridge also picked up a Second Division title medal.

In his 27th year, Aldridge finally had the chance to play in the First Division. He was the third-highest scorer in the division (only surpassed by Gary Lineker and Frank McAvennie) and netted six goals in United&#x27;s League Cup-winning run in 1986 which culminated in a 3–0 victory over Queens Park Rangers in the final at Wembley. This is Oxford&#x27;s only major trophy to date. His 23 goals from 39 games also assisted in Oxford avoiding relegation.

Aldridge ended up playing 141 times for Oxford, scoring 90 goals – a goal every 1.5 games – including fourteen League Cup goals in 17 ties. He scored four goals against Gillingham in the League Cup on 24 September 1986 and three hat-tricks, the first in the 5–2 victory over Leeds United on 24 November 1984. He also scored one of the two Oxford goals that defeated Manchester United in Alex Ferguson&#x27;s first game as manager, on 8 November 1986, maintaining his fine form into the 1986–87 season.

===Liverpool===

In early 1987, Liverpool were losing striker Ian Rush to Juventus at the end of the 1986–87 season and needed a proven and experienced replacement. He signed for Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s side on 27 January 1987 for £750,000 and was initially used as a partner for Rush (filling a position previously occupied by player-manager Dalglish and fellow striker Paul Walsh) and as an occasional substitute. Dalglish had been interested in signing other strikers, including Chelsea&#x27;s David Speedie and Arsenal&#x27;s Charlie Nicholas, for a number of months before settling on Aldridge. By the time of his transfer to Liverpool in that 1986–87 season, Aldridge had already scored fifteen goals for Oxford in 25 games.

Liverpool ended the season trophyless, including a Wembley defeat to Arsenal in the League Cup final, for which Aldridge was ineligible.

Aldridge made his debut for Liverpool on 21 February 1987, when he came on as a 46th-minute substitute for Craig Johnston in a 2–2 league draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park. His first goal for his new club came a week later on 28 February, in the 60th minute, the only goal of the game as Liverpool beat Southampton in a league match at Anfield.

Aldridge scored 26 goals in a successful season for Liverpool, including a strike in each of the first nine games, forming a 10-match scoring run as he had scored in his final league appearance of the previous season.

He linked up with new signings Peter Beardsley and John Barnes as Liverpool lost only twice in the league season and went unbeaten for the first 29 matches. Liverpool won the 1988 league title with a nine-point lead over their nearest rivals Manchester United, although the gap between Liverpool and their nearest contenders was considerably wider for much of the season.

Aldridge scored both goals in the club&#x27;s FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. With Wimbledon 1–0 up in the FA Cup final at Wembley, midway through the second half, Liverpool were awarded a spot-kick when Aldridge himself was fouled, and he took the resulting penalty. Aldridge had scored all eleven of his penalty kicks that season, but goalkeeper Dave Beasant noticed that he always placed the ball to the keeper&#x27;s left. Aldridge did, as predicted, place the penalty to Beasant&#x27;s left, and the keeper sprang across to save it. He became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in a Wembley FA Cup final. Aldridge&#x27;s failure was his first penalty miss for Liverpool. He was substituted shortly afterwards as Liverpool lost 1–0.

The following season was tough and eventful for Aldridge. Rush failed to settle in Italy and Liverpool paid £2.8 million to bring him back to Anfield just before the season started. Dalglish played Aldridge and Rush together. In the Charity Shield match against Wimbledon at Wembley, Aldridge started the match and scored both Liverpool goals in a 2–1 win. Aldridge maintained his scoring streak, often playing alongside both Rush and Beardsley in attack, while Rush missed a number of games or started games on the bench due to injuries. In the first league game of the season a week later, Aldridge scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win at Charlton Athletic. He scored another league hat-trick on 14 March, in the 5–0 home win over Luton Town, which took his league tally for the season to fifteen goals. He reached the twenty-goal mark on 13 May in a 2–1 win at Wimbledon, and finished the season as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 22 goals in the league, eight in the FA Cup, two in the League Cup, and two in the Charity Shield, amounting to 34 in all competitions.

In the 1989 FA Cup final at Wembley, against Merseyside rivals Everton, Aldridge scored after four minutes with his first touch of the ball. Rush, who replaced Aldridge as a substitute, scored twice in extra time to earn Liverpool a 3–2 victory. Aldridge scored 21 league goals, and 31 in all competitions, putting him among the highest scorers in the first division that season. The League and FA Cup double, achieved by Liverpool in 1986, was again possible, with a deciding game against Arsenal to come at Anfield. Aldridge played in a game which would guarantee Liverpool the title as long as Arsenal failed to win by two clear goals. 1–0 down in injury time, Liverpool conceded another goal to Michael Thomas with virtually the last kick of the season, thus losing the League title.

Aldridge played 104 times for Liverpool, scoring 63 goals, 50 of them in the league.

===Real Sociedad===
The following 1989–90 season, Kenny Dalglish reverted to a 4–4–2 formation with Rush and Beardsley as first-choice strikers. Liverpool accepted an offer of £1 million from La Liga side Real Sociedad in early September 1989, with Aldridge having played twice in the league for Liverpool that season.

This transfer made Aldridge the first non-Basque player to sign for Sociedad in several decades as they changed their selective recruitment policy.

Aldridge scored 40 goals in 75 appearances for Sociedad over two seasons, with the club encouraged to make more signings from English football in 1990, namely Dalian Atkinson and Kevin Richardson. Despite his success, some Sociedad fans initially did not accept him because he was a non-Basque. Insulting graffiti was written on the stadium, a fan spat on the ground when Aldridge passed in the street, and his family found it hard to adapt to the different lifestyle in the Basque country. Aldridge handed in a transfer request in 1991 to the newly appointed manager John Toshack – another former Liverpool striker.

===Tranmere Rovers===
Aldridge returned to Merseyside on 11 July 1991 with Tranmere Rovers, in a £250,000 deal. While there he scored a club-record 40 goals in his first season at Prenton Park – scoring his 40th goal against former club Oxford United. Tranmere, who were playing in the Second Division for the first time in more than fifty years, achieved a mid-table finish in the league.

He made his debut for Rovers, aged 32, on 17 August 1991, scoring both the goals in a 2–0 victory over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at the Goldstone Ground. In seven years as a Tranmere player, he amassed a total of 294 appearances, scoring 174 goals, an average of one goal every 1.7 games, including 22 goals from 25 League Cup ties. Aldridge retired at the end of the 1997–98 season, scoring a brace in his final game as a professional against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Aldridge&#x27;s goals helped Tranmere reach their highest position ever in the league – top-six finishes in the second tier in 1993, 1994 and 1995 – which delivered playoff places each time, but all of them ended in semi-final defeats. He also came close to winning another major trophy as Rovers took Aston Villa to a penalty shoot-out in the 1993–94 League Cup semi-finals before bowing out to the eventual competition winners.

During his career in England alone, Aldridge played 739 games, scoring 411 times – an average of one goal every 1.8 games.

On 12 March 1996, with the resignation of John King after nine years as manager, Aldridge became player-manager of Tranmere, before finally giving up playing and concentrating on the management side two years later. In his first season in charge, Rovers finished the 1995–96 season in thirteenth place in Division One.

Under Aldridge, Tranmere reached the 2000 Football League Cup final (which they lost to Leicester City) and consecutive FA Cup quarter-finals in 2000 and 2001. During the 2000 League Cup final, Aldridge slapped the face of Leicester&#x27;s Theo Zagorakis after he applauded the referee&#x27;s decision to send off Clint Hill. The slap was seen by FA officials and he was charged with misconduct. Aldridge said of incident: &quot;I felt he [Zagorakis] had disrespected Clint on one of the biggest occasions of his career so I slapped him&quot;. Tranmere were relegated into English football&#x27;s third tier in 2001. Aldridge resigned in March 2001, just before Rovers&#x27; fate was sealed.

==International career==
Aldridge had already been recruited to play for the Republic of Ireland by the time he was approached by Liverpool at the start of 1987, qualifying through his grandmother, who was from Athlone. (When the Football Association of Ireland came looking for him they found out that Ray Houghton, who also played for Oxford at the time, was also eligible.) He made his debut, aged 27 on 26 March 1986 against Wales at Lansdowne Road in a 1–0 defeat. The match was the first under new manager Jack Charlton.

That summer, Aldridge played for the Irish side which had qualified, under Charlton, for Euro 88 in West Germany, their first-ever major finals. They duly beat England 1–0, and drew 1–1 with the Soviet Union, but went out of the competition after a defeat by eventual champions the Netherlands. Aldridge was struggling at international level at this time – he was playing well as a team performer, and Charlton was never unhappy, but it took him 20 matches to score his first international goal, which came against Tunisia at Lansdowne Road on 19 October 1988.

Aldridge withdrew himself from Ireland&#x27;s World Cup qualifying tie with Spain at Lansdowne Road on 26 April 1989, as he felt unable to participate in the game due to his grief over the Hillsborough disaster. The game ended in a 1–0 win for Ireland. Aldridge finally scored his first goals at competitive level when he scored twice in a 2–0 win away over Malta, which sealed Ireland&#x27;s qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

Aldridge played a crucial role in Ireland&#x27;s path to the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. Though he had finally opened his goal account for his country, he failed to score at the World Cup (although he had a goal disallowed in a 1–1 draw with the Netherlands) and Ireland lost to the host nation in the last eight. Aldridge played every game but was substituted in all of his five appearances.

Ireland failed to qualify for Euro 92, despite going through their group unbeaten. Aldridge scored three times in qualification, all three goals coming in Ireland&#x27;s opening 5–0 win over Turkey at Lansdowne Road. Despite this setback, Aldridge helped Ireland to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup: he scored six times in qualifying including a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Latvia.

Aldridge&#x27;s international career with Ireland is also remembered for an off-pitch incident at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Trailing 2–0 to Mexico in a group game in Orlando, Florida, Charlton tried to send Aldridge on as a substitute but was delayed by a perceived sluggishness from the officials. Manager and player both launched expletive-laden tirades which were clearly heard by television viewers, with Aldridge having to be restrained from attacking the fourth official and a FIFA representative. When Aldridge finally was allowed on, after six full minutes of trying, he scored a goal to give Ireland a chance to get back into the game. After the game Aldridge was fined $2,500 by FIFA for unsporting behaviour. Despite losing the game 2–1, Aldridge&#x27;s goal was crucial in securing qualification for the second round. All four teams in the group had finished with the same number of points and the same goal difference, Ireland&#x27;s qualification was at the expense of Norway who had scored just one goal fewer.

Aldridge continued to play for Ireland in the qualifying stages of Euro 96. Despite a strong start to the group, Ireland failed to qualify. Aldridge scored twice in a 3–0 win away to Latvia in Ireland&#x27;s opening game and was also on the scoresheet in a 4–0 away win against Northern Ireland. In Ireland&#x27;s final home game of the group, Aldridge scored twice against Latvia in a 2–1 win, but Ireland failed to qualify after finishing second and losing a subsequent playoff to the Netherlands at Anfield in December 1995. Aldridge at this time was one goal short of the 20-goal record held by Frank Stapleton, but despite playing in the early stages of qualifying for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he failed to score again to match the record and retired in 1996 to concentrate on managing Tranmere Rovers. His final game was a 3–0 win against Macedonia on 9 October 1996, when he came on as a substitute.

Overall, Aldridge scored nineteen goals in sixty-nine matches spanning over a decade; eight of his nineteen goals came against Latvia.

==Career after football==

Aldridge is now a pundit with various media organisations – most notably with Radio City 96.7 where he summarises on the station&#x27;s Liverpool commentaries home and away. He also continues to play in the Liverpool veterans&#x27; team. In 1998, he asked Hyder Jawad to ghost-write his autobiography. &quot;John Aldridge: My Story&quot; was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton the year after.

In 2006, he gained media celebrity in Ireland by appearing in RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Charity You&#x27;re A Star&quot; competition. Despite not having a natural singing voice, Aldridge won the competition and in the process raised money for his nominated charity Temple Street Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Aldridge was a crowd favourite everywhere he went, especially on Merseyside where being a local lad helped his cause. This was confirmed when a poll conducted by the official Liverpool F.C. website during the summer of 2006 placed him in 26th position. 110,000 Liverpool supporters worldwide took part in the poll named &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;, where they were asked to name their favourite Reds of all time.

In March 2008, Aldridge took part in the autobiography audio CD series &quot;60 minutes with John Aldridge&quot;. He spoke in depth about his career with &quot;60 minutes&quot; presenter David Knight and later took part in a major signing session, signing 2000 copies of the CD in support of the Everyman appeal charity.

Aldridge was allegedly involved in the &quot;News of the World&quot; hacking scandal in the mid-2000s. &quot;They tell me I was hacked five or six years ago. I have no idea why they should go after me. I&#x27;m not exactly high profile.&quot;

<text>Dell XPS (&quot;Extreme Performance System&quot;) was a line of consumer-oriented laptop and desktop computers manufactured by Dell from 1993 to 2025.
== History ==
In the early 1990s, Dell primarily targeted its products at businesses rather than consumers. In early 1993, Dell executives met to address how to pursue the emerging consumer market in the US (led by Gateway 2000, later known as Gateway), and decided to launch a new product line to compete with Gateway. At that time, Dell&#x27;s annual revenue was less than $500 million, and founder Michael Dell was still directly involved in key decisions. Vernon Weiss, the product manager, led the project and managed product marketing, while Brian Zucker oversaw architecture and engineering.

In September 1993, the first two products in the XPS line were announced, initially as part of the Dell Dimension series. The first generation XPS systems were available in both desktop and tower configurations. The earliest known XPS PC, the Dell Dimension XPS 466V, was released in 1994. The new product line achieved commercial success, garnering significant media attention. For example, an XPS was featured on the cover of the October 1993 issue of &quot;PC/Computing&quot;.

From 1997 to 2001, the XPS line lost its leading position in the market as Dell steadily grew and the market continued to evolve over time. Dell then revamped the XPS line in 2005 to compete with Alienware (then a separate company) and Falcon Northwest. Correspondingly, Dell split its home desktop system into two lines (Dell Dimension and XPS), its consumer notebooks were also split into two lines (Dell Inspiron and XPS). Shortly thereafter, on March 22, 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, a move they had been considering since 2002. Alienware maintained its autonomy in terms of design and marketing, but access to Dell&#x27;s supply chain management, purchasing power, and economies of scale lowered its operating costs. The new XPS line initially had the same specifications as those offered by the Alienware division.

In 2008, Dell introduced the &quot;Studio XPS&quot; line, which it marketed as a performance computer line, while Alienware was advertised for gaming. On June 2, 2009, the M18z gaming laptop was introduced as the first Alienware/Dell joint-branded system.

In January 2025, Dell announced its intentions to retire the XPS brand (along with the Inspiron and Latitude lines) in favor of a singular brand that emphasizes the &quot;Dell&quot; name as part of the company&#x27;s preparation for their next-generation AI PCs. Other brands such as HP have also done a similar practice, with HP retiring most of their other brands (such as the Pavilion and Spectre) in May 2024 in favor of a singular &quot;Omni&quot; brand for their own line of AI PCs.

=== XPS One 27&quot; ===
The Dell XPS One 27&quot; is an all-in-one PC that, hence its name, features a 27-inch screen with a resolution of 2560 pixels wide and a height of 1440 pixels. It received CNET&#x27;s 2012 Editor&#x27;s Choice Award and was chosen as PCMag&#x27;s best all-in-one PC of 2012.

CNET editor Rich Brown, who authored the review awarding the XPS One 27&quot; the Editor&#x27;s Choice Award, noted that it &quot;boasts the highest-display resolution among Windows 8 all-in-ones, and at an aggressive price.&quot;

PCMag&#x27;s page discussing selections for the best products of the year stated that it &quot;put almost every technology and feature we&#x27;re looking for in a compact stylish chassis.&quot;

There are reports from many buyers complaining of a quality control issue on the screen. There are dust particles trapped between the screen and the touch panel. Some buyers even received several exchanges or screen replacements and the issue remains. Some people may not notice but turning the brightness up will show these spots. They look like dead pixels.

=== Studio XPS ===
The Studio XPS, also referred to as Studio XPS 435MT, was released on November 16, 2008. This is a PC with performance somewhat between the XPS 420 and 630. Its processor is the Intel Core i7. The current Studio XPS models, however, are not as gamer-oriented, with only one PCIe x16 slot and a 475-watt power supply. It has RAID0/1 support, however, as well as the capability of up to 24 GB of RAM. Later this model was renamed to the Studio XPS 9000, later succeeded by a newer version, the Studio XPS 9100.

=== XPS One 20 and XPS One 24 ===
Released on November 19, 2007, the Dell XPS One is an all-in-one desktop designed for &quot;minimal fuss and maximum cordless connectivity&quot;, and ships with the power cord, and a wireless keyboard with a touchpad and wireless mouse prepared to the system.

The XPS One 20 and XPS One 24 were subsequently discontinued by Dell.

=== XPS 18 ===
The Dell XPS 18 was announced in April 2013. It is an all-in-one computer that also functions as a large tablet. It has a screen size of 18.4 inches.


=== XPS H series ===
A system that came out circa 1996/97. It contained an Intel Pentium II (Klamath) CPU, EDO DRAM, and an i440FX chipset.

=== XPS D series ===
A system that came out in 1997. It contained an Intel Pentium II (Klamath) CPU, SDRAM, and an i440LX chipset.

=== XPS B series ===
A system that was introduced in 2000. It contained an Intel Pentium III CPU, 128 MB of RDRAM, an ATi RAGE graphics card, and an i820 chipset. An &quot;r&quot; suffix was used for Socket 370 versions, while no suffix was used for Slot 1 versions. Later models (especially the &quot;R&quot; series) had a built-in DVD drive.

=== XPS Gen 2 ===
Included Pentium 4 processor with Hyper-Threading Technology (3.4 GHz, 800 MHz Bus, Microsoft Windows XP Professional, 400 MHz dual-channel DDR SDRAM (400 MHz), Supports SATA and IDE hard drives, one AGP Slot, four PCI slots, Sound Blaster Audigy², and Dell Wireless Keyboard and Mouse. Video Card included was ATI Radeon 9800 Pro (AGP x8).

It was powered by a 460-watt proprietary power supply and featured decorative LEDs on the front of the case that the user could change the colors of in the BIOS.

=== XPS Gen 3 ===
The base configuration had a Pentium 4 processor at a speed of 3.0 GHz or higher, 512 MiB of DDR, 400 MHz memory, a single 80 GB 7200 RPM hard drive, an ATI Radeon X800 XT graphics card, and a Sound Blaster Audigy² audio card. It came pre-installed with Windows XP Home Edition.

=== XPS Gen 4 ===

=== XPS 200 series ===
==== XPS 200 ====
This model was available from late 2005 to the end of the third quarter of 2006. It was replaced by the XPS 210, which is nearly identical to its predecessor. The main exception in this case is the upgrade to an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and other minor adjustments.

==== XPS 210 ====
A small-form-factor case that is 67% smaller than the XPS 410. It does not use full-size PCI slots. The XPS 200 is aimed at being a low-impact machine, meaning that it blends in better with the room&#x27;s features. Despite the XPS name, it is more of a multimedia computer than an actual gaming machine. The main difference between the XPS 210 and its predecessor, the XPS 200, is the upgrade to the Intel Core 2 Duo processor line. This makes the XPS 210 faster than the XPS 200. It was also sold as the Dimension 9200C outside of the United States, which alongside the 9200 (which was a rebranded XPS 410) was also the final desktop in the Dimension line, effectively making an XPS unit the last in the Dimension family.

=== XPS 400 series ===
==== XPS 400 ====
This model was available during late 2005 and the first half of 2006. It was replaced by the XPS 410, which is nearly identical except for an optional Intel Core 2 Duo processor and slightly different audio and video card options. It was rebranded outside the United States as the Dimension 9150, which was replaced with the Dimension 9200.

==== XPS 410 ====
The former intermediate model of the XPS series and bigger brother to the Dimension E520. It features a base configuration of an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Quad is also available as an option. Other base options include the NVIDIA GeForce 7300LE, 7200RPM SATA-300 hard drive, and dual-channel DDR2 RAM. The case is nearly identical to that of the Dimension E520, with an additional 3.5-inch drive bay being added. The case is physically taller because of this. The power supply is also slightly more powerful than the Dimension E520 (375 W vs 305 W, respectively and has an added six-pin PCIe power cable). The XPS 410 replaced the XPS 400. It was replaced by the XPS 420.

XPS 410 units were also sold as the Dimension 9200 in some countries, allowing Dell to continue selling the remaining units after the XPS 410 was discontinued. Released in 2006, the Dimension 9200 (as well as the Dimension 9200C, which was a rebranded XPS 210) was the final desktop in the Dimension line, effectively making an XPS unit the last in the Dimension family.

==== XPS 420 ====
This model featured similar components to the XPS 410, but it uses different case designs and new features. This was Dell&#x27;s media-based computer featuring the Dell Xcelerator (a simple and effective Video Recorder), and an LCD screen in the case, running Windows Vista SideShow. As usual with the 4XX Line of XPS, it did not allow for SLI Graphics. The XPS 420 added support for 45 nm Core2 Duo/Quad/ and Extreme CPUs up to the QX9650. It has since been discontinued.

==== XPS 430 ====
Similar to 420, but with DDR3 RAM and without the LCD on the computer chassis.

==== Studio XPS 435T (or Studio XPS 9000/9100), Studio XPS 435MT ====
The Dell XPS 435T was a mid-tower desktop that originally shipped with a Nehalem-based Intel Core i7 processor. The system&#x27;s motherboard used Intel&#x27;s X58 chipset, allowing for 3 memory channels over 6 available DIMM slots. The XPS 435T can support Westmere-based Core i7 and Xeon processors (supporting up to 6 cores) with the latest BIOS update.

The XPS435MT was a smaller Mini Tower version that shared the X58 chipset. Unlike the 435T, the 435MT&#x27;s BIOS was never updated to support Westmere-based Core i7 or Xeon chips. The motherboard is a variation of the MSI 7591 MicroATX.

=== XPS 600 series ===

==== XPS 600 ====
The former flagship model of the XPS series features an Intel dual-core Pentium D 950 processor, dual Nvidia GeForce 7900GTX in SLI mode, 7200 RPM SATA hard drive, and dual-channel DDR2 RAM. This case has not changed significantly over the past several generations, with the large aluminum plate on the front. Discontinued a few days after the XPS 700 launch and succeeded by the XPS 700.

==== XPS 625 ====
A version of the XPS 630 but with AMD Phenom II chips and ATI Graphics.

==== XPS 630 ====
The 2008 desktop at one time filled the gap between the media-oriented XPS 420/430 and the high-end XPS 730x. There is no physical difference(s) between the 630 and the 630i. The marketing concept was to use an &quot;i&quot; to designate systems installed with an Intel chipset, and an &quot;a&quot; for systems with AMD-installed chipsets, but since Intel-based chipsets were the only models ever sold, this designation holds little significance. The 630 features a Dell-modified Nvidia NForce 650i chipset that supports both SLI and CrossFire configurations, but lacks ESA certification (the only ESA-certified component in the 630i is Dell&#x27;s &quot;Master Input/Output&quot; (or &quot;MIO&quot;) printed circuit board). The XPS 630 at one time came standard with an Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 CPU and dual Nvidia GeForce 8800GT graphics cards.

===== Problems and solutions =====
There were several issues with the XPS 630 including problems with the chassis fan control, chassis LED lights, and non-shipment of the LightFX 2.0 lightshow control software. limited PCIe slot configuration (8,8,1,1 unlike OEM Nvidia 650i SLI motherboards which also offer the 16,1,1,1 configuration), constant HDD LED activity, and a reliability issue due to a problem inherent in the Nvidia 650i SLI chipset that can surface when overclocking with 4 or more gigabytes of RAM. The problems resulted in PC PRO revoking their Recommended award for the system.

The July 22, 2009 release of a Softex Media Plug-in has provided some of the features originally advertised in LightFX. BIOS updates were issued to patch the constant HDD LED activity. Some 630i owners have bypassed the aforementioned problems by swapping out the Dell-modified 650i motherboard with OEM motherboards such as the EVGA nForce 780i SLI FTW. The motherboard has 8 lanes wired for each PCIe slot, which can restrict performance if using a single high-performance graphics card. Performance is equivalent to other systems with 650i chipset motherboards when using two graphics cards in SLI mode.

=== XPS 700 series ===

==== XPS 700 ====
Targeted at the gaming community, this model featured the Intel Pentium D Extreme processors in speeds up to 3.7 GHz with dual NV GeForce 7900 GTX in SLI mode, a 7200RPM SATA hard drive and dual-channel DDR2 RAM. This desktop was advertised as being overclockable but was not. Dell would later offer a free XPS 720 motherboard upgrade program to all XPS 700 and 710 owners so that these machines could be overclocked with the bios. The aluminum case featured a distinctive &quot;leaning&quot; design. The XPS 700 used significantly larger power supplies (750 watts and 1 kilowatt) than the other XPS models to accommodate higher-end video cards and overclocked CPUs. Unlike its forerunners, it used a BTX motherboard, thereby limiting upgradability. It was replaced by the XPS 710 and many customers were offered a free motherboard upgrade to the XPS 720 specification following complaints about the system.

==== XPS 710 ====
The former flagship model of the XPS series featured the new Intel Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Extreme processors, as well as Core 2 Quad processors. Other features include dual NVIDIA GeForce 7950 GX2 in Quad SLI mode, 7200RPM SATA hard drive, dual-channel DDR2 RAM. The XPS 710 uses significantly larger power supplies than the other XPS models to accommodate higher-end video cards and overclocked CPUs. It was replaced by the XPS 720.

==== XPS 720, XPS 720 H2C ====
Announced on November 24, 2007, the XPS 720 is the same as the XPS 720 H2C, except it does not have the &quot;dual-stage radiator cooling technology.&quot; It comes in two versions, the Red Special Edition, which is the same as the Black normal one, they both come with a 1 kW power supply.

The H2C edition computer has included a dual-stage radiator cooling technology, and a motherboard capable of overclocking its quad-core Intel Core 2 Extreme QX6800. The H2C comes standard with dual NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTX cards running in SLI for $6,780. The XPS 720 H2C uses slightly higher quality parts than other XPS classes. At the time it was one of the most powerful and fastest pre-built systems an individual could purchase by a significant margin.

==== XPS 730 H2C ====
The 730 H2C had H2C (a high-performance cooling system) as standard, which was ideal for gaming and overclocking. Its motherboard, the NVIDIA NForce 790i Ultra, was capable of overclocking its quad-core Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9770 up to 3.64 GHz. Dual channel DDR3 SDRAM system memory was available in United States and UK. There was a choice of colors also at some outlets. The basic model specs of the PC were: Intel Core 2 Extreme Processor QX9650 (3.46 GHz Overclocked), DUAL 1 GiB ATI Radeon 3870 X2 Crossfire X Graphics Card, 2 GiB Memory, 1 TB 7200rpm Dual HDD. The base price in the UK was £2,499. The system also came with an improved H2C cooling device, seen on ultra high gaming computers. This has since been replaced by the XPS 730x (see above).

==== XPS 730X, XPS 730X H2C ====
Released on November 16, 2008, the XPS 730X was essentially an XPS 730 with the new Intel Core i7 which also used the new Intel X58 chipset Motherboards. The XPS 730X H2C was the higher-end version of the 730X that used H2Ceramic cooling and often shipped with factory-overclocked Core i7 Extreme Edition processors. The 730X also integrates Alienware&#x27;s AlienFX and a new theatre lighting system. The internals of the 730X have also been redone for ease of upgrades, although most of the inside remains the same. The 730X supported a Tri-Channel of 6 GB of DDR3. The graphics card support was either a dual or single NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285, or a single ATI Radeon HD 4870 X2. The 730X originally shipped with Windows Vista, but eventually offered Windows 7 near the end of its availability.
Dell internally discontinued the XPS 730X and XPS 730X H2C in its US online store on August 1, 2009, and cancelled any remaining orders after August 15, 2009. It has been mentioned that this was done to focus more attention on customers seeking gaming computers, such as Alienware. The desktop was officially discontinued on September 17, 2009 (see Dell XPS 730x).

== Laptops ==

Dell returned to develop their XPS performance line in 2010, releasing three new laptops in October of that year, which had many new features and improved specifications compared to previous models. These included JBL speakers with Waves MaxxAudio 3 technology, integrated 3D graphics, the first-ever Skype certification for video chat, and Intel i5 and i7 processors. Dell also offered a software-based X-Fi audio upgrade.

=== XPS 11 ===
==== XPS 11 (9P33) ====
Dell announced the XPS 11 in June 2013. It features an 11.6-inch screen that can be folded backwards almost 360 degrees to act as a tablet. It shipped with Windows 8.1 and a &quot;Haswell&quot; Intel Core i5 processor.

=== XPS 12 ===
==== XPS 12 (9Q23) ====
The XPS 12 is a convertible laptop. The convertible mirrors the general aesthetic of the Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook and other models in the XPS lineup, although the hybrid swaps out its predecessors&#x27; aluminum look for a carbon-fiber exterior. The lid and exterior edge are framed by a machined aluminum edge, while the interior consists of a magnesium-alloy palm rest coated in matte black paint. The Dell XPS 12&#x27;s body was made with a fingerprint-resisting coating. It possesses a hinged, flip-screen LCD. Applying a push to the top of the screen frees the 12.5-inch, 1920×1080 resolution, 400-nit brightness display from the magnetic locks that hold it in place. The convertible&#x27;s 1.7 GHz Core i5-3317U processor sports Intel HD Graphics 4000 integrated graphics, which combine with 4 GiB of RAM and a 128 GB solid-state drive and Core i5 processor, but ups the memory to 8 GiB and the storage to 256 GB. Some models configuration includes the Core i7 processor, 8 GiB of RAM, and the 256 GB SSD.

==== XPS 12 (9Q33) ====
In July 2013, Dell released its XPS 12 with an Intel Haswell (4th Generation) processor. This upgrade came as a boost in the Ultrabook&#x27;s performance as well as battery life. Dell also added near field communication in this device.
==== XPS 12 (9250) ====
In 2015, Dell released a new XPS 12 with Intel Skylake Core M processors. The hinge system was removed and replaced with a fully detachable display. The device has a 4K Ultra HD (3860×2160) display, a kickstand an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. The new XPS 12 has an all-metal build from the new XPS 13.

=== XPS 13 ===
==== XPS 13 (L321X, Early 2012) ====
The Dell XPS 13 was unveiled at CES 2012. It is the company&#x27;s first Ultrabook, a term coined by Intel. The XPS 13 features a 13.3-inch screen (1366×768 Non-Touch Corning Gorilla Glass) and uses flash memory to help with fast booting. The XPS 13 features certain unique design elements. The edges are rounded and the bottom is made of carbon fiber, with a gentle silicone surface treatment. A battery level indicator was also present and is functional when powered off. Note: Intel Chipset is a second-generation I series.

Dell also offers a developer&#x27;s version of the XPS 13 running Ubuntu Linux.

==== XPS 13 (L322X, Early 2013) ====
The slightly heavier, revised version of L321X. Difference with the previous version include: 4-8 DDR3L RAM, up to 1600 MHz, Mobile Intel 7 series express chipset QS77 (Panther Point, 3rd generation I series), Intel HD 4000 graphics instead of 3000, two USB 3.0 ports, an upgraded wireless card, and a 13.3-inch HD WLED, HD/FHD TrueLife with Gorilla glass LCD.

==== XPS 13 (9333, Late 2013) ====
The device, released in 2013, features a 13.3&quot; LED-backlit touchscreen display boasting a resolution of 1920×1080, reinforced with Corning Gorilla Glass for enhanced durability. Powered by either an Intel Core fourth-generation i5-4200U or i7-4500U processor, complete with an integrated chipset and Intel HD 4400 Graphics, it operates on the Windows 8.1 (64-bit) platform. Memory options include 4 or 8 GiB of Dual Channel DDR3 1600 MHz RAM, with storage capacities of 128 or 256 GB mSATA SSD available. Connectivity is facilitated through the utilization of Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 + Bluetooth wireless technology. Powering the device is a 55 WHr 6-Cell Battery.

Despite its array of features, it is pertinent to note that Dell has not remedied a recurring issue with this generation, characterized by a persistent high-pitched noise emanating from the keyboard area to the right.

==== XPS 13 (9343, Early 2015) ====
Announced at CES and released in January 2015, this model uses Intel Broadwell processors and a renovated 3200×1800 touchscreen of 13.3&quot; set in a very thin frame, and claims up to 15 hours of battery life and many other upgrades on the previous model.

==== XPS 13 (9350, Late 2015) ====
Released in October 2015, the 9350 is similar to the 9343 but with the new Intel Skylake processor (6th generation I series) and a Thunderbolt 3 (with USB 3.1 Gen 2 support) instead of the mini-DisplayPort. There was also another model with i7-6560 CPU and Iris 540 graphics released later for better graphics performance. One of the biggest improvements was an increase in available integrated RAM to 16 GiB DDR3L (in highest versions). It was criticized for the placement of the webcam in the bottom bezel.

==== XPS 13 (9360, Late 2016 and Late 2017) ====
Released in October 2016, the 9360 is similar to the 9350 but with the new Intel Kaby Lake processor (7th generation U series) or, in some models from late 2017 onwards, Intel&#x27;s 8th generation (Kaby Lake-R) U series processors. The XPS 13 Developer Edition comes preloaded with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

==== XPS 13 2-in-1 (9365, Early 2017) ====

The 9365 is similar to the late 2016 XPS 13 (9360) but with a flexible hinge allowing it to fold over into tablet mode. The laptop also features face recognition to log in.

==== XPS 13 (9370, Early 2018) ====

Released in January 2018, the 9370 has an entirely new design refresh, with a smaller footprint and lighter chassis. The battery capacity dropped from 60 watt-hours to 52 watt-hours, most likely due to the smaller form factor. This refresh has Intel&#x27;s 8th generation Core processors (Kaby Lake R) and starts at $USD999, $USD200 more than the 9360. The Intel 8th generation processors used in this version meet the requirements for upgrading to Windows 11. Dell has dropped the barrel-style connector, previously used to charge the device, as well as USB-A ports. The 9370 now includes two Thunderbolt 3, a microSD card reader, one USB-C port and one headphone jack. Dell is also offering a model in white, which uses a different palm rest material than the previous carbon fiber palm rest and deck on the 9360.

==== XPS 13 (9380, Early 2019) ====
Released in January 2019, the 9380 has the webcam back at the top of its monitor. Dell again includes two Thunderbolt 3, a micro SD card reader, one USB-C port and one headphone jack. This refresh has Intel&#x27;s 8th generation Core i3-8145U, i5-8265U, and Core i7-8565U processors, codenamed Whiskey Lake. The base i3 model starts at $949 (USD) but with only 4 GB of RAM, and goes up to $1,659 (USD) with the i7 model.

==== XPS 13 2-in-1 (7390, Mid 2019) ====
The XPS-13 2-in-1 is one of the first in the line-up to be offered with a 10th generation 10 nm Intel Ice Lake processor with Intel Iris Plus integrated graphics. It has a new 13.4-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 16:10, and was launched in August 2019. This model has a soldered SSD which cannot be upgraded, and unlike the 2017 model which is silent and fanless, this model does have two fans for active cooling.

==== XPS 13 (7390, Late 2019) ====

Following the launch of the XPS 13 2-in-1, the refreshed XPS was offered with a new 10th generation 14 nm Comet Lake processor up to a 6-core i7-10710U with Intel Ultra-HD integrated graphics. It is physically identical to the early 2019 XPS 13 9380.

==== XPS 13 (9300, Early 2020) ====

The XPS 13 (9300), like the 2-in-1 7390 updates to the new 10th generation 10 nm Intel Ice Lake processors up to an i7-1065G7, features a new 13.4&quot; inch screen with an aspect ratio of 16:10 and a front-facing webcam supporting Windows Hello facial recognition. Compared to the previous XPS 13 7390, it has a better battery life, larger touchpad and larger keys albeit with slightly reduced travel. It was launched during CES 2020.

==== XPS 13 (9310, Late 2020) ====
The XPS 13 (9310) was released on September 30, 2020, in USA and Canada. It has the same chassis as the previous generation and features Intel&#x27;s new 11th generation 10 nm Tiger Lake processors along with support for Thunderbolt 4.

==== XPS 13 2-in-1 (9310, Late 2020) ====
The XPS 13 2-in-1 (9310) was released on September 30, 2020, in USA and Canada along with the 9310. It has almost the same build as the late 2019 2-in-1; the weight has decreased, to 2.8 pounds from 2.9, and the keyboard layout was tweaked. It features Intel&#x27;s new 11th generation 10 nm Tiger Lake processors, which use Intel&#x27;s improved Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics.

==== XPS 13 (9305, Mid 2021) ====
The XPS 13 (9305) uses a 16:9 aspect ratio screen based upon the Intel 11th gen i5 and i7 processors. While similar to the 9310, the 9305 includes an additional USB-C port (3 in total) and utilizes an earlier generation chassis (XPS 13 9370) with a narrower keyboard (2019 era). The 9305 is intended to be a lower cost model; the screen only comes in 1080p resolution and the maximum hard drive and memory sizes are 512 GB and 16 GB respectively.

==== XPS 13 Plus (9320, Early 2022) ====
The XPS 13 Plus (9320) represents the first substantial redesign of the XPS 13 chassis at a $300 higher price point relative to the 9315. The chassis redesign has removed the headphone jack and card reader, leaving just 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports. This redesign features 12th Gen Alder Lake-P Intel Core processors at 28W TDP, a larger 55-watt hour 3-cell battery, and an OLED screen. It&#x27;s available in full Platinum or Graphite color. The dual fans are now larger, providing more airflow. A non-programmable capacitive function key row replaces physical function keys to widen the hinge points and allow for better cooling. Despite these design changes to accommodate the high 28W TDP, various reviewers have noted noticeable warmth during normal usage. The higher TDP likely also contributes to the lower battery life. The keyboard extends to the full width of the laptop with minimal spaces between the keys with no Delete key. The trackpad is now incorporated into the palm rest.

==== XPS 13 (9315, Mid 2022) ====
The XPS 13 (9315) represents a continuation of the 9310 design with a 13.4&quot; 16:10 screen. It features 12th Gen Alder Lake-U Intel Core processors at a lower 15W TDP and a 51-watt-hour, three-cell battery. The chassis redesign has removed the headphone jack and card reader, leaving just two Thunderbolt 4 ports. A USB-C to headphone jack adapter is included. It is available in full Sky or Umber colour.

There is also a higher resolution 4k 3840x2160, a slightly better CPU - i7-4712HQ.

The 9530 has been criticized for the instability of 802.11ac Wi-Fi. This model has a common issue with coil whine.

==== XPS 15 (9550, October 2015) ====

On October 8, 2015, Dell refreshed the XPS 15 (9550) with the Skylake microarchitecture. A 15.6-inch UltraSharp™ InfinityEdge display is included to fit into the body of a relatively small notebook that responds well to standard Windows 8.1 swipes and commands. Edge-to-edge Gorilla Glass NBT covers the screen. The chiclet keys of the backlight keyboard are matte black and feature a slightly concave surface area. This redesigned model offers PCIe SSDs up to 1 TB, up to 32 GiB of DDR4 RAM through two SODIMM slots, GeForce GTX 960M with 2 GiB GDDR5, a 3×3 802.11ac Wi-Fi card, and featuring Thunderbolt 3 through Type-C, though this port is only able to achieve Thunderbolt 2 speeds.

==== XPS 15 (9560, Early 2017) ====

A slightly updated model 9560 was released in February 2017. The new model aligned with the previous model 9550 in terms of dimension and exterior ports, but inside the CPU and GPU were upgraded to Kaby Lake and GTX 1050, respectively. It also featured an optional 4K glossy touchscreen with 100% sRGB colour coverage, up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM and the same aluminium chassis with carbon-fibre palmrests. This model suffered from many thermal issues at high workloads - primarily due to inadequate cooling of the VRMs - causing the computer to throttle power and limit the CPU to only 800mHz until temperatures dropped. Users could mitigate this by using laptop cooling pads along with undervolting, or using 3rd party tools such as Throttlestop to bypass CPU and power throttling limitations entirely.

==== XPS 15 2-in-1 (9575, Early 2018) ====
The XPS 15 2-in-1 (9575) is similar to the XPS 15 (9560) but with a flexible hinge allowing it to fold over into tablet mode. This convertible laptop features the 8th Generation Intel mobile processors with AMD GPUs integrated into the chip package. It was announced at CES 2018. This XPS 15 utilizes LPDDR3 RAM, which is soldered and not upgradable.

==== XPS 15 (9570, May 2018) ====
The XPS 15 (9570) is the updated version of the XPS 15 (9560) model. This new model brings options for the new Coffee Lake quad-core Core i5, hexa-core Core i7 and Core i9 processors, with the option for the latter, the six-core Core i9-8950HK, being clocked at 2.9 GHz, with a boost clock of 4.8 GHz and the ability to be overclocked as well. This new model also comes with an option for the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti graphics card and has the optional fingerprint scanner integrated into the power button. The webcam placement has also been shifted to be underneath the DELL logo on the bottom of the display. The non-touch Full HD variant also now offers 100% sRGB colour space coverage on its IPS display, and its Thunderbolt 3 port now supports all four PCIe lanes, unlike the previous models, which only had support for two lanes.

==== XPS 15 (7590, 2019) ====
The XPS 15 (7590) was released with an OLED display option (the UltraSharp 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160)). It features 9th Gen Intel Core processors (up to Core i9-9980HK), Wi-Fi 6 technology, and optional NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU. It supports up to 64 GiB of memory with a bandwidth of 2666 MHz, as well as 2 TB PCIe SSD storage. Launched on 27 June.

==== XPS 15 (9500, 2020) ====
The biggest changes in XPS 15 (2020) are that Dell goes all USB-C and 16:10 display aspect ratio. The XPS 15 also has a smaller and higher resolution webcam of 720p and more powerful speakers that aim up out of the laptop. It also got updated inside, including 10th Gen Intel Comet Lake CPU,
up to 64 GiB DDR4 RAM, up to 2 TB PCIe3 x4 SSD storage, Intel Ultra-HD Graphics + NVIDIA GTX 1650 Ti GPU. DELL also offers two types of 15.6-inch Infinity Edge display (1920 x 1200 or 3840 x 2400), and two different capacity batteries (56 Wh or 86 Wh). Size: 13.57 x 9 x 0.7 inches, Weight: 4 pounds (non-touch, 56Whr battery), 4.5 pounds (touch, 86Whr battery). That makes it thinner and lighter than the previous version.

==== XPS 15 (9510, 2021) ====
The 2021 XPS 15 comes equipped with up to Intel&#x27;s 11th Gen Tiger Lake Core i9-11900H and 3050 Ti. It features up to 64 GB of DDR4-3200 and up to 4 TB of m.2 SSD storage, but it can be upgraded to hold a maximum of two 4 TB SSDs.

Ports have also been upgraded, the XPS 15 offers two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a regular USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port.

==== XPS 15 (9520, 2022) ====
Dell has updated its XPS 15 laptops with Intel 12th generation Alder Lake chips. The new CPU options include the Core i5-12500H, Core i7-12700H, and Core i9-12900 HK. Aside from the CPU update, RAM has been upgraded as well from DDR4-3200 to DDR5-4800. GPU and storage options haven&#x27;t changed, so users can still configure with PCIe4 x4 SSDs or up to GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics if desired.

==== XPS 15 (9530, 2023) ====
Dell has updated its XPS 15 laptops with Intel 13th generation Raptor Lake chips. The new CPU options include the Core i5-13500H, Core i7-13700H, and Core i9-13900H. The GPU has also been upgraded from the previous year, now offering a choice from the Intel Arc A370M and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050, 4060 and 4070 options.

==== Comparison ====

=== XPS 15z ===
==== XPS 15z (L511Z) ====
The XPS 15z was released in May 2011 and is a 15.6-inch laptop. It is branded as the thinnest 15 inch PC on the market. It is noted for having a very similar design to the 2011 Apple MacBook Pro computer and even sported a silver aluminum casing. Its base price at release is US$999 (A$1399) and it can be customized up to the dual-core Intel Core i7. It is equipped with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 525M 1 GiB video card (Australian version is equipped with 2 GiB video RAM), and can be customized up to 8 GiB of DDR3 memory. The computer can either have a 750 GB 7200 RPM hard drive or a 256 GB solid state drive. It also contains an 8x slot-loading CD/DVD reader/burner. The American version has a base screen resolution of 1366×768, while the Australian release is 1920×1080 pixels. On 6 September 2011, Dell upgraded the choices for the optional extra Core i5 and i7 processors. Throughout its production, the XPS 15z was plagued with DPC latency-related sound spikes due to faulty network drivers provided by Dell. The solution was to use third-party drivers, as discovered by a community of forum users. Another chronic issue was the lower right corner of the LCD going dim at random times. Replacement of the entire LCD assembly would only temporarily solve this problem. Production of the XPS 15z ceased in the first half of 2012, but its design was carried on by the XPS 14z. The XPS 15z was marketed as a stylish laptop built with &quot;premium materials&quot; with aluminum and magnesium alloy frame 

=== XPS 16 ===
==== XPS 16 (9640) ====
The Dell XPS 16 (9640) was released in early 2024 and is a 16.3-inch laptop. Like the XPS 14 (9440), it has a new, revised keyboard with a shorter travel and touch function row, and a haptic, seamless glass trackpad. As of November, 2024, it starts at a price of US$1,699 and comes with an Intel Core Ultra series 1 CPU, RTX 40 series laptop GPUs, and up to 64GB of soldered-on LPDDR5X memory. The 16.3-inch screen is either a 1920x1200 60Hz LCD, or a 3840x2400 90Hz OLED. Unlike the Dell XPS 17 it replaces, it lacks any expandable memory, and has a smaller screen.

=== XPS 17 ===
==== XPS 17 (L701X) ====
The Dell XPS 17, released in October 2010, was a desktop replacement laptop in the XPS Laptop line. It was priced at $949 for the base configuration but can be customized heavily. Options include a processor upgrade up to the new Intel Core i7-840QM (Nehalem-based), an NVIDIA GeForce GT 555 3 GiB graphics card, up to 16 GiB of DDR3 RAM memory, 1.28 TB Hard Drive space (2×0.64 TB at 7200 RPM), a 17.3-inch 1600×900 resolution screen, and a Blu-ray Disc drive. It also has an LCD upgrade of 1920×1080 (Full HD) and 3D display kit.

==== XPS 17 (L702X) ====
The L702X is quite similar to the L701X, except this model contains the second-generation Intel Core i5 and i7 (Sandy Bridge-based) processors and capability for an FHD Display (Full HD Display) and FHD 3D display. Also, the discrete graphics have been improved to NVIDIA GeForce GT 550M 1 GiB or GT 555M 3 GiB graphics card for Full HD 3D Display. The L702X can also be customized with up to 16 GiB of DDR3 RAM (8 GiB × 2) or 32 GiB (four slots at 8 GiB) of RAM with the 3D model only Model: HMT41GS6MFR8C (Hynix) Issues have been reported with the charging port and the charger falling out with the only slight movements.

====XPS 17 (9700, 2020)====
On May 14, 2020, Dell reintroduced a new XPS 17 after almost a decade since the last model. This model comes with thinner bezels and new thermal designs, It also offers Intel&#x27;s 10th Generation Core i9 45 W processors, 64 GiB of RAM, and 2 TB of storage.
====XPS 17 (9710, 2021)====
In May 2021 Dell introduced an updated XPS 17 with Intel&#x27;s then-latest 11th gen Core i5, i7, i9 processors.

====XPS 17 (9720, 2022)====
In Apr 2022, Dell introduced an updated XPS 17 with Intel&#x27;s then-latest 12th gen Core i5, i7, and i9 processors.

====XPS 17 (9730, 2023)====
In February 2023, Dell introduced an updated XPS 17 with Intel&#x27;s then-latest 13th gen Core i5, i7, and i9 processors.

=== XPS M1730 ===
The XPS M1730 was announced on October 5, 2007, as the newest 17-inch XPS laptop computer. Compared to its predecessor, the XPS M1710, the model M1730 was physically redesigned with a completely new chassis available in grey, white, blue, or red. Like the M1710, the M1730 offered unique user- and software-changeable LED lighting in the touchpad, fan outlets/inlets, as well as the lid and speaker grilles. Also like its predecessor, it featured a 17-inch widescreen. From the components angle, it supported overclockable Intel Core 2 Extreme processors (2.8 GHz to 3.4 GHz overclocked via the X7900 or X9000 Processor), dual NVIDIA GeForce 9800M GTX video cards in SLI, up to two 7200 RPM SATA hard drives available in RAID, and up to 8 GiB DDR2 SDRAM . A Blu-ray Disc Drive was an option in some models. New with this version was a built-in optional AGEIA physics card to enable PhysX enhanced titles to take advantage of hardware accelerated physics, the option for 64 GB solid state drives, a back lit keyboard including a number pad, and a Logitech gaming LCD above the keyboard.

==== Criticism ====

The M1730 has been criticized for its increase in weight and size compared to previous models, and for having only marginal performance gains in select games. The last complaint is likely due to a late NVIDIA release of a mobile version of the 8800M video card which Dell added to the list of options following the release of the M1730.

==== Upgrades ====
Following the initial release of the M1730, the option to have dual 8800M GTX graphics cards in SLI was made available. This is said to have a 174% power increase (as quoted by Dell) over the dual 8700M GTs in SLI which were previously the highest available option. Later, an option to have dual 9800M GT and 9800M GTX graphics cards in SLI has been added to the line.

The 9800M GTX SLI is the highest supported graphics card with 1 GiB GDDR3 VRAM for the M1730, as opposed to the 9800M GT SLI and 8800M GTX SLI only with 512 MB of available Video Memory and slightly higher amount of stream processors. Thus, performs slightly better than the 9800M GT and 8800M GTX cards. The availability of the 9800M GTX SLI is rare, and may only be purchased in limited Dell direct outlets and on eBay. In most cases, they are either out of stock, not on sale any longer or selling the previous 9800M GT and 8800M GTX graphics cards.

=== XPS M1530 ===

This 15.4-inch laptop, released on November 28, 2007, features the Santa Rosa platform. The XPS M1530 is almost identical in design to the XPS M1330 except that it has 4 different colours (blue, black, pink and red) and it is a bit thicker and heavier with a 15.4-inch CCFL or LED screen. It can be configured with Intel Core 2 Duo mobile processors up to T7800 (2.6 GHz) / T9500 (2.6 GHz, 6 MiB L2 cache) / X9000 (2.8 GHz), up to 8 GiB DDR2 SDRAM at 667 MHz, up to 320 or 500 GB 5400 rpm or with faster 160, 240 or 320 GB 7200 rpm hard drive or an optional 128 GB SSD, and can be configured with a 128 MiB DDR2 GeForce 8400GS or 256 MiB DDR3 8600M GT GPU. Wireless draft-n is also available (802.11n). The XPS M1530 includes a biometric fingerprint reader and a 2 MP webcam. Another option for this laptop is a glossy 1920×1200 display, even though it is 9 inches smaller than Dell&#x27;s 24 inch monitor. The system weight starts at 2.62 kg (5.78 lbs) and is dependent upon configuration. The laptop contains an internal slot for a Dell mobile broadband card.

XPS M1530 is no longer available for purchase on Dell&#x27;s website as of early August 2009. Dell became aware that the problem was limited to NVIDIA chip production, the BIOS was updated to A12 which improves thermal control but does not prevent it from reoccurring. The problem associated with NVIDIA GPUs was the chip material used could not stand high temperatures.

=== XPS M1330 ===

This 13.3-inch high-end laptop, released on June 26, 2007, features the Santa Rosa platform. This 13.3-inch screen either with CCFL or WLED; the WLED-backlit version has a 0.3 MP camera, as opposed to the 2 MP camera with the CCFL screen, but the model with WLED screen is thinner and brighter than the previous XPS 1210 version. Moreover, XPS 1330 can also feature a biometric fingerprint reader, usually found in business-class laptops like the Latitude series. The XPS M1330 also offers the NVIDIA GeForce Go 8400M GS graphics card as an option. Originally, it could only be configured with Intel Core 2 Duo mobile processors up to T7700 (2.4 GHz), but could later be configured with processors up to the Intel Core 2 Duo T9500. Noted for its light weight of only 1.8 kg, the XPS M1330 is also available in the product red line along with other Dell computers.

XPS M1330 is no longer available for purchase on Dell&#x27;s USA website as of early August 2009. It has been replaced by the M1340 (Studio XPS 13).

==== Problems ====

The most reported issue with M1330 laptops has been overheating. Dell became aware of the problem and found that it was limited to NVIDIA chip production G84- and G86-GPU&#x27;s, as a result, the BIOS was updated to A12, which improves thermal control but does not prevent it from reoccurring. The problem associated with NVIDIA GPU&#x27;s was the chip material used could not stand high temperatures. This problem was exacerbated by poor thermal contact between the chip and the heat pipe (the gap is too big). Some people have overcome the graphics chip over-heating problem by fashioning a heat sink using a copper plate and thermal paste to fill the gap between the heat pipe and the graphics chip.

Also, there have been several cases reported involving M1330 laptops to be cosmetically defective in manufacture, such as loose hinge covers and unusually uneven gaps between plastic parts, as well as customer complaints concerning &quot;CPU whine&quot;.

=== Studio XPS 13 (M1340) ===

Similar to the Studio XPS 16 but trimmed down into a 13.3-inch 720p 16:10 aspect ratio screen, it has an illuminated QWERTY keyboard and includes leather accents on the lid. Its full body is piano black and silver.

Graphics options are the integrated NVIDIA 9400M G (same as used in MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBooks) and the more powerful NVIDIA GeForce 9500M GE (which is composed of an integrated GeForce 9400M G and discrete GeForce 9200M GS with 256 MB of GDDR3 memory). When configured with the 9500M GE you can switch between the 9400M G running standalone and the 9400M G with the 9200M GS in Windows Vista, without logging out and back in like you must with Apple products due to the availability of Hybrid SLI. Although this model is still available in Europe with the 512 MB NVIDIA GeForce 210 M graphics card and the NVIDIA GeForce MCP79MX Chipset.

=== Studio XPS 16 ===

==== Studio XPS 16 (M1640) ====
Released in early January 2009, it features a 15.6-inch 720p or a 16.0-inch 1080p 16:9 aspect ratio screen. It is equipped with either a 512 MiB ATI Radeon HD 3670 or 1024 MiB ATI Radeon HD 4670 graphics card, an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, a DVD+/- RW or a Blu-ray ROM combo drive, and Windows Vista or Windows 7. It has an illuminated QWERTY keyboard and leather accents on the lid are optional. Its full body is onyx black and silver.

==== Studio XPS 16 (M1645) ====
Same as above, featuring a quad-core Intel Core i7 Clarksfield processor on an intel PM55 chipset mainboard and a 1 GB ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4670 or 5730. Some of these XPS systems were found to have throttling issues when demanding applications like games were run on them. Dell was able to provide a fix for the issue with the help of community input. The fix involved bios updates and a more powerful AC adapter. Other laptops were also found to suffer from the same throttling issue.

==== Studio XPS 16 (M1647) ====
Same as above, featuring a dual-core Intel Core i5 or Intel Core i7 Clarksfield processor. The M1647 motherboard still uses the Intel PM55 chipset (as the M1645) but overall the motherboard uses less power than its predecessor.

=== Gen 3 ===
==== XPS M2010 ====
The XPS M2010 was announced on May 31, 2006, as a top-of-the-line briefcase-styled mobile desktop with a 20.1-inch widescreen with a WSXGA+ resolution and TrueLife. The outside of the case had a leather-like appearance. The XPS M2010 used an ATI Mobility Radeon X1800 graphics with 256 MiB of graphics memory and had support for dual hard drives. The laptop could be customized with an Intel Core 2 Duo T2500, T5600, T7400 or T7600 and 1 GiB, 2 GiB or 4 GiB of DDR2 SDRAM at 667 MHz (Although the machine can take 2x2 GiB at 677 MHz RAM, it will only operate at 3.25 GiB at 500 MHz due to chipset limitation as well as FSB limitation). The laptop expanded to a full desktop set, including a detachable Bluetooth keyboard, Bluetooth mouse, and radio-frequency Media Center remote. It was praised for the high-quality sound system which included 8 separate ¾&quot; speakers below the screen and a 1¾&quot; subwoofer on the bottom of the machine, ported to the right-hand side. While the computer could be folded and carried as a briefcase with its built-in carrying handle, at 18.3 lb it was generally considered too heavy to be a true desktop replacement.

==== XPS M1710 ====
The XPS M1710 was announced on April 18, 2006, as a higher-end 17-inch WUXGA TrueLife widescreen XPS desktop replacement available in black or red. The system was marketed to gamers, sharing a chassis design and many components with the lower-end Inspiron E1705/9400 and the Precision M90 mobile workstation. The base design featured an Intel Core Duo processor, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7900 GS or 7900 GTX, 7200 RPM SATA hard drive, DDR2 SDRAM, a magnesium alloy case including a 1-inch subwoofer complementing the two treble heavy stereo speakers. User configurable multicolor LED lighting was present in the touchpad, fans, speakers and lid with the ability to have them change color/intensity via Dell QuickSet software or via QuickSet plugins to music with bass giving more red-shifted changes and treble more blue-shifted (an SDK developer kit for custom dynamic link libraries could be obtained for integration to many system processes and even games). Technical support was segregated for the XPS line with access to an &quot;exclusive&quot; XPS-branded segment of DELL&#x27;s business support division. The unit was built on the foundation of a Precision M90 chassis. Later models offered the Core 2 Duo processor, the NVIDIA GeForce 7950 GTX GPU, and optional Blu-ray and/or an unlocked Core 2 Duo processor, which could be overclocked &quot;officially&quot; to 3.16 GHz, although at least 3.5Ghz has been reported as possible. As the mainboard used the Intel 945 chipset, the XPS M1710 could not address more than 3.25 GiB of RAM though Dell specified &quot;up to 4 GB RAM&quot;. This computer was replaced by the XPS M1730. The chipset although capable of AHCI operation was never implemented by Dell, leaving any future SATA hard drive upgrade paths crippled to IDE legacy operation, protocols, and bandwidth. Further evidence of untapped capacity involves the use of replacing the video cards with a Dell Precision Quadro FX 1600M (essentially an 8700M GT with comparable performance to the flagship DX9 7950 Go GTX card), allowing for DirectX 10 functionality in a laptop not designed to do so (with the card being unidentified, but the LCD verified by the BIOS, leaving argument that some design foresight was in place for at least a path to using the Quadro FX 1600 and even FX 3600M in this machine in a BIOS revision).
Note that there are severe overheating problems with the graphics card in this model., and just like the Precision M90, GPU failures due to cracking in the type of solder used on the NVIDIA chipsets to bind them to the substrate were common and settled via a class-action lawsuit with NVIDIA in later years.

==== XPS M1210 ====
A high-performance ultra-portable (12.1-inch screen) notebook featuring a new case design, Intel Core Duo processor technology, an optional dedicated NVIDIA GeForce 7400 Go video card and an optional integrated web camera (1.3 megapixel). The M1210 also has optional WWAN (wireless wide area networking) features supporting 3G broadband services. With the standard battery, the laptop weighs 1.9 kilograms. Unlike other 12-inch notebook computers, the M1210 features a built-in optical drive rather than an external one. This model was discontinued as of July 31, 2007.

=== Gen 2 ===

Inspiron XPS Gen 2/XPS M170 (2005) – This successor to the first Inspiron XPS replaced the desktop Pentium 4 processor of its predecessor with a mobile Pentium M processor, which provided almost the same level of performance as the desktop Pentium 4 at a lower clock rate and reduced the weight from 9.06 lb to 8.6 lb. Due to the use of a mobile processor instead of a desktop one, this laptop was thinner and lighter than most other high-performance gaming notebooks of its time and outputs less heat than with the desktop processors used prior. It has a design very similar to the later XPS M1710 and features a 17-inch widescreen display at the same resolution as the first generation. It was initially given the NVIDIA GeForce 256 MiB 6800 Ultra Go GPU, which was a Dell exclusive at the time. The laptop was rebranded as XPS M170 soon after the GeForce Go 7800 GTX was incorporated. The Inspiron 9300 was based on this laptop with the same features and design, but with a 1440×900 screen resolution and an ATI Mobility Radeon X300 in the base model. 
XPS M140 (Late 2005) – The lower-end model XPS computer that has a chassis identical to the later Dell Inspiron E1405 laptop. This model features a choice of several Intel mobile processors, a 14.1-inch widescreen and between 512 MiB to 2 GiB of RAM. This model, being more media-oriented than gaming, does not feature a dedicated graphics card. This model has been replaced by the Inspiron E1405, a 14.1-inch laptop physically similar to the M140. It features the newer Intel Core Duo processors and Intel&#x27;s 945 chipset. It is no longer classified as an XPS laptop, however.

=== Gen 1 ===
Inspiron XPS – The very first XPS laptop was a very heavy desktop-replacement laptop starting at 9.06 pounds without a power supply (which added 2.5 pounds). This was because it was offered with either a 3.4 GHz desktop Pentium 4 HT &quot;Prescott&quot; processor, or the &quot;Gallatin&quot; Pentium 4 Extreme Edition processor at the same clock speed, which gave off tremendous amounts of heat due to their high clock speeds and inefficient microarchitecture, despite a very large copper-based heatsink that spanned the width of the unit with three fans. Other features included a 1920×1200 15.4-inch LCD, and a subwoofer integrated into the bottom of the battery casing, with the 12-cell battery (the 16-cell battery does not include a subwoofer.) Earlier models came with an ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 with 128 MB of memory, and later models with the Mobility Radeon 9800 with 256 MB of memory. The Mobility Radeon 9700 was based on the R360 core of the later ATI Radeon 9800 desktop graphics cards, while the Mobility Radeon 9800 was based on the R420 core which was the same core used on the early ATI Radeon X800 desktop graphics cards, but with half the pixel pipelines disconnected. The Inspiron 9100 was similar to this model, which mostly had the same features and chassis as the Inspiron XPS.

A popular modification to the GPU was to bridge two traces in the top right corner of the PCB surrounding the exposed core with a conductive pen to unlock these pipelines. This could only be done on cores made before week 43 of 2004. Dell promised graphics card upgradeability, but only delivered the arguably small 9700 to 9800 step for 9700 owners (at a rather steep $399 price tag, including a technician to install it), and never delivered the promised upgrade to the 9800 owners.

This model also suffers from a whine on the headphone and microphone jacks that are located on the left of the unit. This is because of shared space with the leftmost fan, and the spinning of the said fan causes interference. There is no known fix for this than to otherwise use an external USB, FireWire/1394 or PCMCIA-based audio device or card for sound output.

== Tablets ==

=== XPS 10 ===
The XPS 10 was an ARM-based convertible tablet with a keyboard stand, similar to Microsoft&#x27;s Surface RT. The tablet, which ran Windows RT, was unveiled on August 30, 2012 and discontinued in September 2013.

== Special Editions ==
Dell has introduced a handful of &quot;speciality&quot; models which were based upon particular models in the XPS series but had unique characteristics. These included custom cases and higher-performance parts (processors, video cards, etc.). Some of these models are considerably rare because they were produced in limited quantities and were either extremely expensive or giveaway only (as was the case of the XPS X-Men Edition, see below).

=== XPS 600 Renegade ===
The first example of a special edition in Dell&#x27;s XPS series was the XPS 600 Renegade released in early 2006, which included an Intel Pentium D Extreme Edition 965 processor that was overclocked at the factory from 3.73 GHz to 4.26 GHz. Despite the overclock, Dell honoured Intel&#x27;s warranty for the processor. The case featured an air-brush paint job completed by Mike Lavallee. Most notably, the machine was the first commercially available system to feature a Quad-SLI configuration, with four custom NVIDIA GeForce 7900GTX graphics cards with 512 MiB of memory. It also included a Western Digital hard drive spinning at 10,000 RPM. The XPS 600 Renegade had an introduction price of $9,930.

=== XPS X-Men Giveaway ===
In 2007 Dell announced a special X-Men version XPS desktop system that was going to be given away. The system had a value of around $10,000 and featured a one-of-a-kind quad NVIDIA video cards and an Intel Pentium 965 Extreme Edition processor. The case resembled a standard XPS 710 series with X-Men artwork on the side.

=== W.O.W. M1730 ===

At CES in 2008, Dell announced a World of Warcraft edition of the M1730 laptop. This version of the M1730 cost around $4,500 and featured an overclockable Intel Extreme Edition Core 2 Duo processor, NVIDIA SLI DX10 graphics cards, PhysX card, with a Full HD 17-inch widescreen. It also came pre-loaded with World of Warcraft and Burning Crusade expansion, as well as other limited edition merchandise including a custom backpack.

=== (PRODUCT)RED ===

<text>Captain Gordon Charles Steele VC (1 November 1891 – 4 January 1981) was an English Royal Navy captain and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
On 1 November 1891, Steele was born in Exeter, Devon, England.

== Career ==
Steele was 27 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Navy serving with the North Russia Relief Force when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 August 1919 at Kronstadt, Russia, Lieutenant Steele was second-in-command of Coastal Motor Boat 88. Steele&#x27;s boat became illuminated by an enemy searchlight. Very heavy machine gun fire followed immediately, the captain being killed and the boat thrown off course. A British aircraft saw the problem, dived on the searchlight and put it out with gunfire. Lieutenant Steele took the wheel and steadied the boat, lifting the dead officer away from the steering and firing position, and successfully torpedoed the battleship &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot; at 100 yards range. He then manoeuvred the CMB in a very confined space to get a clear shot at the other battleship &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; before making for the safety of the bay.

He was later promoted to the rank of captain and served in the Royal Navy during World War II. In 1940 he met, by chance and for the first time, the pilot of the aircraft (by now Group Captain Fletcher, RAF) who had attacked the searchlight.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1958 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

== Personal ==
Steele&#x27;s wife was May Mariette Steele. On 4 January 1981, Steele died in Winkleigh, Devon county, England. He was 89. On 28 Oct. 1982, Steele&#x27;s wife died Winkleigh, Devon county, England. Both Steele and his wife are buried at All Saint&#x27;s New Cemetery in Winkleigh.

<doc id="1208739" wikidata="Q5314482" url="?curid=1208739" title="Duncan Macrae (actor)">
<text>John Duncan Macrae (20 August 1905 – 23 March 1967) was one of the leading Scottish actors of his generation. He worked mainly as a stage actor and also made five television appearances and seventeen films.

==Life and career==
Macrae was born at 118 Kirkland Street, Maryhill, Glasgow, the fourth of the six children of James Macrae, a sergeant in the Glasgow police force, and his wife, Catherine Graham. He attended Allan Glen&#x27;s School and matriculated in the engineering faculty at Glasgow University in 1923–1924, but did not graduate. He trained as a schoolteacher at Jordanhill College, where he met Ann H Mcallister, the voice coach, who was a profound influence on his life. He taught in Glasgow until he became a professional actor in 1943, after a successful amateur drama career.

He first made his name as a comic actor of distinction with Curtain Theatre, an amateur group, in 1937, in the title role of Robert McLellan&#x27;s &quot;Jamie the Saxt&quot;, a performance which became his &quot;signature&quot; role in the early years. In 1938, he directed Curtain&#x27;s production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; at the Lyric Theatre in Glasgow. He was then a member, along with Stanley Baxter, of the early Citizens&#x27; Theatre company in Glasgow, founded during the war in 1943. In 1948, he played Oliphant, the Laird of Stumpie, in the first performance of Robert Kemp&#x27;s &quot;Let Wives Tak Tent&quot;, a translation into Scots of Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;école des femmes&quot;, at the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh.

He had a role in the 1949 Ealing comedy &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;, based on the book by Sir Compton Mackenzie, and, in the first TV series adapted from stories about &quot;Para Handy – Master Mariner&quot;, Neil Munro&#x27;s masterpiece of west coast &quot;high jinks&quot;, Macrae played the eponymous Captain. He lived in Glasgow and also had a home in Millport on the island of Cumbrae. In 1953 he starred alongside Jean Anderson in the role of James MacKenzie, an embittered settler in the drama &quot;The Kidnappers&quot; for which he received a Scottish Arts Council award. One of the film&#x27;s most memorable moments comes with the horror on Duncan Macrae&#x27;s face at what his grandchild must have thought of him when the little boy implores &quot;Don&#x27;t eat the babbie&quot;.

Macrae played the Nabob in the Edinburgh Gateway Company&#x27;s Edinburgh International Festival production of McLellan&#x27;s historical comedy &quot;The Flouers o Edinburgh&quot; in August 1957. He then played the title role in James Bridie&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Angelus&quot; at The Gateway before returning to the Citizens&#x27; to play Malvolio in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. He also played the lead role in &quot;The Sow&#x27;s Lug&quot;, a radio play written and produced by the Hawick poet and writer David Hill. 

During the 1960s he appeared in episodes of the cult TV series &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, as well as Inspector Mathis in the James Bond spoof &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

Macrae became a mainstay of television Hogmanay celebrations in the 1950s and 1960s with a rendition of his song (in Glaswegian Scots), &quot;The Wee Cock Sparra&quot;.

Macrae died in March 1967, in Glasgow, before the release of several screen appearances: in the films &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and &quot;30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia&quot;, and in the television series &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

<doc id="1208743" wikidata="Q940534" url="?curid=1208743" title="Beneath... Between... Beyond...">
<text>Beneath... Between... Beyond... is the compilation album by American industrial metal band Static-X, released on July 20, 2004, through Warner Bros. Records. It is a compilation of previously unreleased tracks, remixes, cover versions, and the band&#x27;s original demo tracks. The band did some touring in support of the album.

== Background ==
In a 2004 &quot;Metal Edge&quot; feature on the compilation, frontman Wayne Static explained that the idea for &quot;Beneath... Between... Beyond...&quot; came about due to fan enquiries about songs &quot;that appeared on some soundtrack for some old movie&quot;, and questions about where these songs were. As most of the CDs the rare songs were featured on had gone out of print, Static-X decided to release a compilation album to make them more accessible to fans. To make the release more special for hardcore fans, the band decided to include never-heard-before demo tracks that were recorded at the band&#x27;s rehearsal space in Los Angeles, in order to &quot;give all of you an idea of how a song evolves from its demo form, to the finished recording you hear on one of our albums&quot;.

== Content and songs ==
&quot;Beneath... Between... Beyond...&quot; is composed of previously unreleased tracks, cover versions, and original Static-X demo tracks, dating back as far as 1996. Although the song &quot;Crash&quot; (featured on Mephisto Odyssey&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Red Connection&quot; in 2000) is &quot;not completely a Static-X song&quot;, Static opted to include it on &quot;Beneath... Between... Beyond...&quot; due to his and (then-former) guitarist Koichi Fukuda&#x27;s involvement with its production.

=== Outtakes ===
&quot;S.O.M.&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Head&quot; and &quot;So Real&quot; were part of the 16 songs that Static-X recorded in 1998 for the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; (1999), and out of 25 that were written for the album. After selecting the album&#x27;s twelve songs, the band decided to keep the unused tracks &quot;for future use&quot;. &quot;S.O.M.&quot; (&quot;Symptoms of Mercy&quot;), which Static and bassist Tony Campos both considered to be one of their favourite songs from the &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; sessions, features heavy guitar riffing inspired by Crowbar. Static described &quot;Down&quot; as &quot;a killer mixture of drum-and-bass style with pure metal shredding&quot;, and stated that it was inspired by the Slayer/Atari Teenage Riot collaboration &quot;No Remorse (I Wanna Die)&quot;, from &quot;&quot; (1997). &quot;So Real&quot; was primarily composed by Static and Fukuda, with Campos contributing something at the end of the song at the band&#x27;s request. &quot;S.O.M.&quot; was featured on an MTV compilation, &quot;Return of the Rock&quot;, whilst &quot;So Real&quot; was included in the soundtrack for &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000).

&quot;Anything But This&quot; was written and recorded during the recording sessions for Static-X&#x27;s second album &quot;Machine&quot; (2001) in December 2000. The song features lots of screaming and double-kick drums as well as an unexpected transition to clean guitars on the chorus, which (in a rare instance) features Campos singing the entire chorus. Static considered the song to be &quot;the heaviest, most brutal thing [Static-X] ever put down on tape&quot;, noting that he lost his voice tracking vocals for it. &quot;Breathe&quot; was also written during the &quot;Machine&quot; sessions by Static, who left it off of the album as he felt it did not fit in with the rest of the material. It resurfaced during recording sessions for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Shadow Zone&quot; (2003), and the band &quot;threw ideas into [the song] the make the finished version&quot;, according to Eisen. Considering it reminiscient of Prong, Campos attempted to convince the band to get Prong frontman Tommy Victor to do vocals for the song, but &quot;no one took [him] seriously&quot;. &quot;Deliver Me&quot; originated from a demo that guitarist Tripp Eisen was working on that Static liked. It was one of Campos&#x27; favourite songs from the &quot;Shadow Zone&quot; sessions and he wanted to include the song on the album, whilst Eisen felt it was better suited to a soundtrack album. The song ultimately ended up on the soundtrack of the 2003 remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. 

=== Remixes ===
&quot;Beneath... Between... Beyond...&quot; includes two remixes of the band&#x27;s singles &quot;Push It&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m With Stupid&quot;, by then-Fear Factory touring keyboardist John Bechdel and Ministry bassist Paul Barker, respectively. After meeting him in New York, Wayne Static asked Barker to do a remix of &quot;I&#x27;m With Stupid&quot;, which came out &quot;sounding like a cool mix of Static-X and Ministry&quot;, according to Static. The &quot;Push It (JB&#x27;s Death Trace Mix)&quot; appeared on the &quot;Push It&quot; EP (which also includes &quot;Down&quot;), whilst the &quot;I&#x27;m With Stupid (Paul Barker Mix)&quot; was included in a Warner Bros. sampler release.

=== Cover songs ===
The compilation features three cover songs: &quot;Burning Inside&quot; (by Ministry), &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; (by Black Sabbath) and &quot;Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment&quot; (by the Ramones). &quot;Burning Inside&quot; was recorded as a duet with then-Fear Factory frontman Burton C. Bell during a break in the 1999 Ozzfest Tour, and the song itself was a fixture of Static-X&#x27;s live setlists during the &quot;Machine&quot; tour. According to Bell, Static was unsure of the song&#x27;s lyrics and had to look them up online, but felt that he got &quot;fairly close&quot; to them. The band contributed &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; to the Black Sabbath tribute album &quot;Nativity in Black 2&quot; (2000). The band recorded the song&#x27;s guitar and bass tracks using a &quot;little cigarette box amplifier&quot;; as the band did not have a wah-wah pedal at the time, they got their sound engineer, Bruce Reiter, to &quot;hold the little amp up to his mouth while he opened and closed it!&quot;, according to Static. &quot;Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment&quot; was recorded in 2002 for &quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family: A Tribute to Ramones&quot;, but was omitted from the album &quot;because they had too many songs&quot;, according to Static. The song was later added as a bonus track to the Japanese release of &quot;Shadow Zone&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first song recorded with Tripp Eisen, and the last song that original Static-X drummer Ken Jay performed on before his departure from the band later that year (although he would later rejoin in 2018).

=== Demos ===
&quot;I Am&quot; and &quot;Love Dump&quot; (which would later appear on &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot;) were recorded for Static-X&#x27;s first six-song demo in 1996 by Static, Campos and Jay, which was later used to get the band signed to Warner Bros. Although he was not a member of Static-X when the demos were recorded, Koichi Fukuda was listed in the demo&#x27;s liner notes as he was a member of Static-X by the time the band started distributing them. The &quot;Get to the Gone&quot; demo (from &quot;Machine&quot;) was recorded by Static, Campos and Jay as part of a rehearsal tape for producer Ulrich Wild in late 2000, following Fukuda&#x27;s departure from the band. The demos for &quot;New Pain&quot; and &quot;Otsegolectric&quot; (from &quot;Shadow Zone&quot;) were demoed with a Akai MPC 2000 drum machine, and Static noted the &quot;rigidity&quot; of the demos compared to their album version counterparts. &quot;Otsegolectric&quot; features an extended intro with a sample, whilst Eisen stated that &quot;New Pain&quot; was &quot;a real work in progress&quot; at the time of its recording, and that it would &quot;[morph] a lot from [its] original concept&quot;. These demos were among those that were played for Josh Freese, who would become the session drummer for &quot;Shadow Zone&quot;.

<text>A unit load device (ULD) is a container used to load luggage, freight, and mail on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows preloading of cargo, provided the containerised load fits in the aircraft, enabling efficient planning of aircraft weight and balance and reduced labour and time in loading aircraft holds compared with &#x27;bulk-loading&#x27; single items of cargo or luggage by hand. Each ULD has its own packing list or manifest so that its contents can be tracked. A loaded aircraft cargo pallet secured with a cargo net also forms a ULD, but its load must be gauged for size in addition to being weighed to ensure aircraft door and hold clearances.

The IATA publishes ULD regulations and notes there are 900,000 in service worth more than US$1 billion, averaging $ each.

==Types==
ULDs come in two forms: pallets and containers. ULD pallets are rugged sheets of aluminium with rims designed to lock onto cargo net lugs. ULD containers, also known as cans and pods, are closed containers often made of aluminium or a combination of aluminium (frame) and Lexan (walls) but there are examples of containers made of GRP with an insulating foam core. Depending on the nature of the goods to be transported, ULDs may have built-in refrigeration units. Examples of common ULDs and their specifics are listed below.

; Notes


==Aircraft compatibility==
LD3s, LD6s, and LD11s will fit 787s, 777s, 747s, MD-11s, Il-86s, Il-96s, L-1011s and all Airbus wide-bodies. The 767 uses the smaller LD2s and LD8s because of its narrower fuselage. The less common LD1 is designed specifically for the 747, but LD3s are more commonly used in its place because of ubiquity (they have the same floor dimensions such that one LD3 takes the place of one LD1). LD3s with reduced height ( instead of ) can also be loaded on the Airbus A320 family. LD7 pallets will fit 787s, 777s, 747s, late model 767s (with larger doors), and Airbus wide-bodies.

Interchangeability of certain ULDs between LD3/6/11 aircraft and LD2/8 aircraft is possible when cargo needs to be quickly transferred to a connecting flight. Both LD2s and LD8s can be loaded in LD3/6/11 aircraft, but at the cost of using internal volume inefficiently (33 ft3 wasted per LD2). Only the LD3 of the LD3/6/11 family of ULDs can be loaded in a 767; it will occupy an entire row where two LD2s or one LD8 would otherwise have fit (90 ft3 wasted per LD3). Policies vary from airline to airline as to whether such transfers are allowed.

The 787, intended to replace the 767, was designed to use the LD3/6/11 family of ULDs to solve the wasted volume issue.

===ULD capacity===


Aircraft loads can consist of containers, pallets, or a mix of ULD types, depending on requirements. In some aircraft the two types must be mixed as some compartments take only specific ULDs.

Container capacity of an aircraft is measured in &quot;positions&quot;. Each half-width container (LD1/LD2/LD3) in the aircraft it was designed for occupies one position. Typically, each row in a cargo compartment consists of two positions. Therefore, a full-width container (LD6/LD8/LD11) will take two positions. An LD6 or an LD11 can occupy the space of two LD3s. An LD8 takes the space of two LD2s.

Aircraft pallet capacity is measured by how many PMC-type LD7s can be stored. These pallets occupy approximately three LD3 positions (two positions of one row and half of the two positions of the following row) or four LD2 positions. PMCs can only be loaded in cargo compartments with large doors designed to accept them (small door compartments are container-only).

==Identification==

All ULDs are identified by their ULD number. A three-letter prefix identifies its type and key characteristics, followed by a 4 or 5 digit serial number (4 if prior to October 1, 1993; either 4 or 5 if after October 1, 1993) to uniquely identify it from others of the same type, and ending with a two character (alpha-numerical) suffix identifying the ULD&#x27;s owner (if an airline, often the same as IATA designator codes). For example, &quot;AKN 12345 DL&quot; means that the ULD is a forkliftable LD3 with the unique number &quot;12345&quot; and its owner is Delta Air Lines.

==Main-deck ULDs==

On the main deck of cargo planes are tall ULDs with footprints similar to those of or wide pallets and or long. A wide × tall ULD is half the volume of a × 88 inch pallet. The 20 foot pallet is long and wide. What the actual dimensions of contoured upper deck ULDs are is very hard to know, because most manufacturers only profile width, length and height data.

There are several common types of contoured main deck ULDs, that are contoured (curved to fit in the plane&#x27;s body) to provide as much cargo volume as possible. Initially ULD contouring was simply a triangle removed from one or two corners of the profile of the ULD, such as the common LD3 and LD6. Main deck ULDs use curves for the contoured shape to truly maximize cargo volume. Upper deck ULDs are just like lower deck ULDs that are either the full width of the plane with two corners of the profile removed (lower deck LD6 lower), or that container is cut in half, down the center line of the plane, (lower deck LD3 and upper deck AAX).

Main deck ULDs and pallets are not only taller than lower deck ULDs, they are frequently two or four times longer. They are usually organized like an LD6, using the width of the plane and missing two profile corners, or two very long LD3s, stored in parallel to use the plane&#x27;s width and each missing one profile corner, but often twice or four times as long from plane&#x27;s nose to tail.

Many air cargo companies use main deck ULDs that have both features called dual-profile, so that on smaller planes such as the Boeing 727, they are stored widthwise and have two corners contoured, and on the bigger Boeing 767, they can be rotated 90 degrees and shipped in parallel like LD3s, so that only one corner is contoured when being used like an LD3. This greatly simplifies transportation of cargo containers at slight cost of cargo volume.

In Germany, on 1st March, 1945, during an attack on Kervenheim, Private Stokes was a member of the leading section of a platoon pinned down by heavy fire from a farm building. Without waiting for orders Private Stokes dashed through the enemy fire, to disappear inside this building. The fire stopped, and he reappeared, wounded in the neck, bringing with him twelve prisoners. 
This valiant action enabled the platoon to advance to the next objective. Private Stokes was ordered back to a Regimental Aid Post, but refused to go. The platoon then encountered heavy fire from a house on the left. Again without waiting for orders, Private Stokes rushed the house by himself and all firing from it ceased. His gallantry enabled his platoon, which he subsequently rejoined bringing five more prisoners, to continue the advance. In the final assault Private Stokes, now severely wounded, once more dashed to the objective through intense fire. He finally fell, firing his rifle to the last. It was found that he had been wounded eight times in the upper part of the body. Private Stokes&#x27;s one object throughout this action was to kill the enemy, at whatever personal risk. His magnificent courage, devotion to duty, and splendid example inspired all around him, and ensured the success of the attack at a critical moment; moreover, his self-sacrifice saved his Platoon and Company heavy casualties.

<text>Someone like You is a 2001 American romantic comedy film directed by Tony Goldwyn, based on Laura Zigman&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Animal Husbandry&quot;. The film stars Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Marisa Tomei, and Ellen Barkin, and follows a heartbroken woman looking for a reason why she was dumped.

==Plot==

Jane Goodale is a production assistant for a talk show that has recently become nationally syndicated. Her boss, host Diane Roberts is always pushing her staff to book ungettable guests, like Fidel Castro. Jane has a friendly but adversarial relationship with fellow producer, Eddie Alden, a shameless serial womanizer.

When new producer Ray Brown arrives, Jane is immediately smitten. Despite Ray admitting to having a serious girlfriend, Dee, he and Jane begin an affair. Eddie runs into them on the sidewalk and deduces the relationship, expressing skepticism to Jane that it&#x27;ll last. After several weeks, Ray confesses his love for Jane and asks her to move in with him.

Ray ends things with Dee, but seems troubled by her lack of apparent emotion to the news, and begins enthusiastically apartment hunting with Jane. They find a place they love and begin to move forward, but Ray suddenly becomes distant and after much delay tells Jane his feelings have changed and he no longer wants to be with her. Since her apartment has been re-rented, Jane is left with nowhere to live and becomes Eddie&#x27;s roommate.

Jane reads a magazine article about bovine sexuality, learning that bulls lose interest in intercourse with cows after they&#x27;ve already mated with them once. Jane excitedly tells her best friend, Liz, about the article and her belief that it applies to men--she is an &quot;old cow&quot; who has been already serviced, so Ray lost interest in her, which would also explain Jane&#x27;s past bad luck with men.

Liz, after experiencing heartbreak herself, proposes Jane write a column about her theory, under the pen name Dr. Marie Charles for the men&#x27;s magazine Liz works for. The article is a huge success, becoming widely discussed in the news. Diane demands her staff book Dr. Charles for the show.

At a Christmas party, Ray tells Jane he misses her, asking her out for New Year&#x27;s Eve, but he stands her up. The next day, Ray admits he&#x27;s reunited with Dee, who is revealed to be Diane. Eddie comforts Jane and helps her muster her courage before a staff meeting, but she nonetheless lashes out at Ray for his deception.

Over drinks with Liz, Eddie and Jane argue about Dr. Charles&#x27; &quot;new cow&quot; theory. At home she tells him she has to believe the theory because otherwise she fears men don&#x27;t leave women - just her. Eddie comforts her, saying Ray is not the last man she&#x27;ll ever love, and they fall asleep together.

In the morning, Jane says that while Eddie can be kind, his true self will inevitably come out and hurt her. Jane&#x27;s brother-in-law calls with the news that her sister, who has been trying desperately to have a child, has had a miscarriage. Jane visits them and is deeply moved by her brother-in-law&#x27;s love and devotion for his wife. She calls Diane and tells her she booked Dr. Charles for a telephone interview.

On the day of the interview, Jane decides to hang up the phone and admit on stage that she is the source of the article and that Dr. Charles does not exist. She calls her own theory ridiculous and says men are more nuanced than she gave them credit for. She realizes the depth of her feelings for Eddie and, discovering he&#x27;s left the studio, chases after him. She finds him on the sidewalk and admits she was wrong and has fallen in love with him. They kiss passionately.

<text>eXist-db (or eXist for short) is an open source software project for NoSQL databases built on XML technology. It is classified as both a NoSQL document-oriented database system and a native XML database (and it provides support for XML, JSON, HTML and Binary documents). Unlike most relational database management systems (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases, eXist-db provides XQuery and XSLT as its query and application programming languages.

eXist-db is released under version 2.1 of the GNU LGPL.

==Features==
eXist-db allows software developers to persist XML/JSON/Binary documents without writing extensive middleware. eXist-db follows and extends many W3C XML standards such as XQuery. eXist-db also supports REST interfaces for interfacing with AJAX-type web forms. Applications such as XForms may save their data by using just a few lines of code. The WebDAV interface to eXist-db allows users to &quot;drag and drop&quot; XML files directly into the eXist-db database. eXist-db automatically indexes documents using a keyword indexing system.

==History==
eXist-db was created in 2000 by Wolfgang Meier.

eXist-db was awarded the best XML database of the year by InfoWorld in 2006.

The companies eXist Solutions GmbH in Germany, and Evolved Binary in the UK, promote and provide support for the software.

There is an O&#x27;Reilly book for eXist-db which is co-authored by Adam Retter and Erik Siegel.

==Supported standards and technologies==
eXist-db has support for the following standards and technologies:
* XPath - XML Path language
* XQuery - XML Query language
* XSLT - Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
* XSL-FO - XSL Formatting Objects
* WebDAV - Web distributed authoring and versioning
* REST - Representational state transfer (URL encoding)
* RESTXQ - RESTful annotations for XQuery
* XInclude - server-side include file processing (limited support)
* XML-RPC - a remote procedure call protocol
* XProc - a XML Pipeline processing language
* XQuery API for Java

<doc id="1208779" wikidata="Q2668869" url="?curid=1208779" title="Glamorama">
<text>Glamorama is a 1998 novel by American writer Bret Easton Ellis. &quot;Glamorama&quot; is set in, and satirizes, the 1990s, specifically celebrity culture and consumerism. &quot;Time&quot; describes the novel as &quot;a screed against models and celebrity&quot;.

==Development==
Ellis wanted to write a Stephen King-style ghost story novel, which would eventually become &quot;Lunar Park&quot;; finding it difficult at the time, he began work on the other novel which he had in mind. This was a Robert Ludlum-style thriller, with the intention of using one of his own vapid characters who lack insight as the narrator.

Ellis composed the book between December 1989 and December 1997.

==Literary devices, plot, and themes==
The novel is a satire of modern celebrity culture; this is reflected in its premise, which features models-turned-terrorists. A character remarks, &quot;basically, everyone was a sociopath ... and all the girls&#x27; hair was chignoned.&quot; The novel plays upon the conspiracy thriller conceit of someone &quot;behind all the awful events&quot;, to dramatize the revelation of a world of random horror. The lack of resolution contributes to Ellis&#x27; artistic effect. The obsession with beauty is reflected in consistent namedropping; this satirizes (the main character) Victor&#x27;s obsession with looks, and perhaps is indicative of the author&#x27;s own attraction to glamor.

Ellis drops names in &quot;Glamorama&quot; so often that &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; describes &quot;Nary a sentence ... escapes without a cameo from someone famous, quasi-famous, or formerly famous. In fact, in some sentences, Ellis cuts out those pesky nouns and verbs and simply lists celebrities.&quot; Namedropping and commoditization have a depersonalizing effect (a world reduced to &quot;sheen and brands&quot;); as the reviewer for &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; observes, &quot;When Victor undergoes a transformation to a law student, we know he is different because he now wears a Brooks Brothers suit and drinks Diet Coke. London and Paris become nothing more than a different collection of recognizable proper nouns (Notting Hill and Irvine Welsh in the first case; &quot;Chez Georges&quot; and Yves Saint Laurent in the second).&quot; A writer for the &quot;New York Times&quot; observes &quot;much of his prose consists of (intentionally) numbingly long lists of his characters&#x27; clothes and accouterments ... out of which his loft-dwellers somewhat hopefully attempt to assemble something like an identity&quot;. In speech, his writing demonstrates the ways in which his characters, too, have internalized the language of consumerist advertising and marketing. According to the &quot;Lakeland Ledger&quot;, &quot;Glamorama&quot; is something of a &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; allegory and a cautionary tale navigating the perils of dissolving identity.

In parody of how people now think in modern terms, Ellis &quot;annoying[ly]&quot; lists &quot;the songs that are playing in the background, or even quoting them, as he does with Oasis&#x27; &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;; in effect, the novel is provided with a movie soundtrack. As such, the book feels at times like a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a snuff film. New technology such as photo manipulation software (e.g. &quot;PhotoSoap for Windows 95&quot;) are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes hard to tell what is real in the &#x27;modern&#x27; world. As such, &quot;meaningful identity is obliterated&quot;; this furthers the recurring joke from &quot;American Psycho&quot; wherein &quot;characters are always getting confused by their friends with other people, with no noticeable consequences&quot;.

The book prominently features a conceit wherein Victor&#x27;s life is being filmed by a camera crew &quot;introduced a third of the way into the book&quot;. As well as a postmodern device to examine the questionable &quot;reality&quot; of the situation, it also functions as a &quot;tidy commentary&quot; on the advent of mass surveillance in the 1990s. &quot;EW&quot; interprets the scene to mean &quot;Modern life has become a movie (a point made more cogently by Neal Gabler&#x27;s new book, &quot;Life the Movie&quot;).&quot; The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; took the same meaning from the conceit, and described it as a &quot;not-so-deep observation&quot; that &quot;has no real pay-off&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; felt it was a &quot;halfhearted narrative device ... suggesting that the novel&#x27;s action is actually part of a film that&#x27;s being made.&quot; The reviewer felt that allusions to &quot;the director&quot; or to the fact that this or that scene is a &quot;flashback&quot; was used to retroactively suggest cohesion in the novel&#x27;s plot.

&quot;As much as celebrity itself, our collective celebrity worship becomes the real target of Ellis&#x27; satire&quot;, writes the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;. Models in the novel act as a synecdoche of the larger culture. Reviewer Eric Hanson writes, &quot;Their [models&#x27;] selfishness and brutality, he implies, are simply an extreme manifestation of what consumer culture encourages in everyone.&quot; Victor&#x27;s own pursuit of being cool or too hip &quot;destroys him&quot;. A CNN reviewer gives the example of Victor not wanting to explain his impersonator, &quot;because the places he was seen were always hot spots he should have frequented.&quot;

==Characters==
Victor Ward is the novel&#x27;s lead character, who had previously appeared as Victor Johnson in &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (1987). In &quot;Glamorama&quot;, now an &quot;A-list model, would-be-actor and current &quot;It boy&quot;, &quot;an uberstereotype of the male model&quot;, Victor lives by his catchphrase mantra &quot;the better you look, the more you see&quot;. As &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; observes, &quot;His lifestyle is the extreme of everything the current culture worships: he can&#x27;t avoid thinking in brand names and image and speaks with lines from pop songs.&quot; Uncharacteristic for an Ellis protagonist, as the &quot;Crimson&quot; notes, Victor is &quot;terrified by&quot; the &quot;coldbloodedness&quot; he encounters when he becomes embroiled in international terrorism. As an unintelligent narrator, Victor (through his inability to comprehend his situation), underlines how &quot;the world of celebrity in &quot;Glamorama&quot; is inescapable&quot;. Compared to other Ellis protagonists, Victor is less &quot;sensitive and insightful&quot; than &quot;Less than Zero&quot;&#x27;s Clay, neither the &quot;preening psychopath&quot; that is &quot;American Psycho&quot;&#x27;s Patrick Bateman&quot;, he is nevertheless an &quot;[un]sympathetic protagonist (in his own way, he&#x27;s as morally bankrupt as ... Patrick Bateman).&quot; As narrator, &quot;Victor&#x27;s perceptions&quot; sum up &quot;[the glamor world&#x27;s] disconnection from what the rest of us consider &quot;real life&quot;... [where] Everything he sees is a brand name&quot;. CNN speculates when Victor begins speaking to the novel&#x27;s &quot;film crew&quot; (one of its literary devices), that this could mean that the character is schizophrenic. Victor comes across &quot;oddly homophobic for a member of the pansexual New York fashion scene&quot;; when his gay assistant accuses &quot;I know for a fact you&#x27;ve had sex with guys in the past&quot;, he retorts that he did &quot;the whole hip bi thing for about three hours back in college&quot;.

The mysterious F. Fred Palakon first appears a quarter of the way into the novel, when he offers to pay Victor $300,000 to track down his former Camden classmate Jamie Fields, a double-agent working in the terrorist organisation with which Victor becomes involved. It is never clarified exactly which political organisation Palakon appears to be working for; he even appears alongside Senator Johnson, Victor&#x27;s father, a United States senator with ambitions to become President. Of Palakon, &#x27;the director&#x27; says &quot;We&#x27;ve been through this a hundred times ... There is no Palakon. I&#x27;ve never heard that name. Victor&#x27;s girlfriend Chloe Byrnes is a supermodel and a recovering drug addict. Alison Poole, the main character from Jay McInerney&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, appears, having also previously appeared in &quot;American Psycho&quot; in 1992. In &quot;Glamorama&quot;, Alison is &quot;[Victor&#x27;s] boss&#x27;s girlfriend (another supermodel)&quot;, &quot;here playing Lewinsky&quot;. Bobby Hughes is a successful male model and the leader of his international terrorist group. Victor engages in a bisexual threesome with him and with Jamie Fields. Lauren Hynde from &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; also reappears, having become a successful actress with ties to Hughes&#x27; terrorist organisation; other &quot;Rules&quot; characters appear (e.g., in flashback) such as Bertrand Ripleis, who is now a terrorist also.

== Adaptations ==
In 1999, the contemporary Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero wrote a composition for chamber ensemble entitled &quot;Glamorama Spies&quot;, which was inspired by the novel.

&quot;Glitterati&quot; is a 2004 film directed by Roger Avary assembled from the 70 hours of video footage shot for the European sequence of &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. It expands upon the minimally detailed and rapidly recapped story told by Victor Ward, portrayed by Kip Pardue, upon his return to the United States after having travelled extensively around Europe. In regard to expanding upon those events, the film acts as a connecting bridge between &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; and the upcoming film adaptation set to be directed by Avary. Avary has called &quot;Glitterati&quot; a &quot;pencil sketch of what will ultimately be the oil painting of &quot;Glamorama&quot;&quot;.

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;Glamorama&quot;, narrated by Jonathan Davis, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

In 2010, when a film adaptation of &quot;Glamorama&quot; was mentioned in an interview with Movieline.com, Bret Easton Ellis commented, &quot;I think the days of being able to make that movie are over.&quot; From the same interview, Ellis mentioned that an idea for a mini-series adaptation was brought forth to HBO though it was ultimately declined and further stating the movie would be left in Roger Avary&#x27;s hands if one was to be made.

On October 13, 2011, Bret Easton Ellis reported on Twitter the following: 

===&quot;Zoolander&quot; controversy===
Fans have noted similarities to the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy &quot;Zoolander&quot;. Ellis stated that he is aware of the similarities, and went on to say that he considered and attempted to take legal action. Asked about the similarities in a 2005 BBC interview, Ellis said that he was unable to discuss them under the terms of an out-of-court settlement.

==Reception==
Much criticism of the novel noted its length. &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s Joel Stein noted &quot;The idea—models so solipsistic that they become terrorists—is a good-enough one for a short story of 15 pages, but it&#x27;s unsustainable at 482.&quot; He describes the book&#x27;s first 185 pages as &quot;inanely repetitive&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opines &quot;It&#x27;s like reading Page Six of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, but for 482 pages.&quot; One reviewer found the opening scenes &quot;funny enough&quot; although noted that it &quot;gets tired easily&quot;. Contrarily, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; felt &quot;the satiric early half is Ellis in peak form, the thriller-style second half is less successful.&quot; In fact, the humor in the novel was praised by multiple critics. The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; notes Victor&#x27;s lack of depth, malapropisms, overuse of the word &quot;baby&quot; and the novel&#x27;s &quot;enchantingly disaffected monotone&quot; of &quot;a been-there-done-that Valleyspeak&quot;. Hanson felt that the horror elements in the &quot;labyrinthine&quot; thriller section of the novel seemed &quot;recycled from &quot;American Psycho&quot;.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also state their preference for the &quot;first 189 pages&quot;. Contrarily, the &quot;New York Times&quot; felt that the book was devoid of fun, where even the blackest satire (e.g. Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;The Loved One&quot;) are more humorous.

&quot;EW&quot; places &quot;Glamorama&quot; within an emerging tradition of celebrity satire, noting &quot;the glitterati are the satirical target du jour, what with Woody Allen&#x27;s limp, oral-sex-filled film &quot;Celebrity&quot;, and Jay McInerney&#x27;s clever novel &quot;Model Behavior&quot;&quot; (both 1998). McInerney (a friend of Ellis) noted the novel&#x27;s comparative darkness to his own &quot;Model Behaviour&quot; (also about 90s nightlife and supermodels), published the same year, saying &quot;I deliberately wrote a comic novel because you don&#x27;t go chasing butterflies with sledgehammers&quot;. (Regarding McInerney&#x27;s novel, Stein had felt that the novelist&#x27;s attempt at a zeitgeist novel was one &quot;looking at the &#x27;90s through an &#x27;80s lens&quot;.) &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; noted, similar to McInerney, that &quot;Celebrity by itself teeters so often into self-parody that it seems too easy to bash it&quot; but remarks that &quot;Fortunately, Ellis does more than that injecting &quot;Glamorama&quot; with a sharper plot than those of earlier novels, a plot which kicks in about a quarter of the way into the novel.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; question the choice of subject matter as well: &quot;Ellis&#x27;s satirical message is, essentially, a one-liner, and hardly an original one at that – celebrity culture is vapid, yes, and?&quot; The reviewer furthermore suggested &quot;&quot;Glamorama&quot; is itself just another artifact of the culture it pretends to criticize.&quot;

The book&#x27;s style is summarized by one reviewer as &quot;a book that reads like a movie&quot;, and another notes that Ellis&#x27; writing &quot;can be sharp&quot;, and succeeds in creating a &quot;creepy sense of dread about our culture&quot;. On its influence, &quot;Time&quot; felt that the novel&#x27;s &quot;contribution&quot; to the world comes in Victor&#x27;s catchphrase, which they describe as Tom Wolfean. In an otherwise damning review, the &quot;New York Times&quot; commented &quot;[Ellis] has an uncannily keen eye for the tiny details of the lives of the abel-obsessed yuppies and would-be celebs he&#x27;s sending up&quot;. A CNN reviewer felt, upon reading the book, that &quot;Bret Easton Ellis is a gifted writer&quot;; he praised his &quot;unflinching eye&quot; in capturing the details of &quot;the ensemble worn by a notorious clothes horse, or the grisly aftermath of a hotel bombing, or the graphic details of a menage a trois .&quot; The world Ellis evokes, through the eyes of the male model, &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; notes is one &quot;where no one has any emotions beyond the visceral response, where all the sex scenes are described in purely pornographic terms.&quot;

A.J. Jacobs of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; did not enjoy the book&#x27;s more &quot;meta&quot; conceits, and gives the novel a &#x27;C&#x27;. Daniel Mendelsohn of the &quot;New York Times&quot; opines derisively that &quot;Like its predecessors, &quot;Glamorama&quot; is meant to be a withering report on the soul-destroying emptiness of late-century American consumer culture, chichi downtown division; but the only lesson you&#x27;re likely to take away from it is the even more depressing classic American morality tale about how premature stardom is more of a curse than a blessing for young writers.&quot; The CNN reviewer concludes that &quot;in the end, &quot;Glamorama&quot; is less than the sum of its parts&quot;.

Ellis himself has claimed that, as of 2018, the novel has failed to break even for its US publisher, Knopf.

<text>Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) is a source-controlled variable-rate multimode codec designed for robust encoding/decoding of wideband/narrowband speech. The operation of VMR-WB is controlled by speech signal characteristics (i.e., source-controlled) and by traffic condition of the network (i.e., network-controlled mode switching). Depending on the traffic conditions and the desired quality of service (QoS), one of the 4 operational modes is used. All operating modes of the existing VMR-WB standard are fully compliant with cdma2000 rate-set II. VMR-WB modes 0, 1, and 2 are cdma2000 native modes with mode 0 providing the highest quality and mode 2 the lowest ADR. VMR-WB mode 3 is the AMR-WB interoperable mode operating at an ADR slightly higher than mode 0 and providing a quality equal or better than that of AMR-WB at 12.65 kbit/s when in an interoperable interconnection with AMR-WB at 12.65 kbit/s.

Now also a cdma2000 rate-set I compliant mode is implemented to the coder as mode 4. The average bitrate of the mode is 6.1 kbit/s (maximum is 8.55 kbit/s). Source coding bitrates are: Rate-Set I - 8.55, 4.0, 2.0, 0.8 kbit/s, Rate-Set II - 13.3, 6.2, 2.7, 1.0 kbit/s. VMR-WB uses 16 kHz sampling frequency. Algorithmic delay is 33.75ms.

VMR-WB can be also used in 3GPP2 container file format - 3G2.

VMR-WB was designed by Nokia and VoiceAge. It is based on AMR-WB.

<text>Roadwork is a thriller novel by American writer Stephen King, published in 1981 under the pseudonym Richard Bachman as a paperback original. It was collected in 1985 in the hardcover omnibus &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;. The story takes place in an unnamed city of the Midwestern United States in 1972–1974. Grieving over the death of his son and the disintegration of his marriage, a man is driven to mental instability when he learns that both his home and his workplace will be demolished to make way for an extension to an interstate highway. A film adaptation of the novel was announced in August 2019, with Pablo Trapero as director and Andy Muschietti (director of &quot;It&quot; and &quot;It Chapter Two&quot;) and Barbara Muschietti as producers.

==Plot==
During a man-on-the-street news interview in August 1972, an unnamed man (later identified as Barton George Dawes) gives his angry opinion of a new highway extension project. The narrative then jumps forward to November 1973, with Dawes, seemingly unaware of the underlying motivations of his actions, visiting a gun shop and purchasing two high-powered firearms: a .44 Magnum revolver and a hunting rifle chambered for .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridges. The story gradually reveals that Dawes&#x27; son Charlie had died of a brain tumor &quot;no bigger than a walnut&quot; three years earlier, and that Dawes is unable or unwilling to sever his emotional ties to both the industrial laundry where he works and the house in which Charlie grew up. The laundry and his entire neighborhood are to be demolished as part of the project.

Dawes resigns his middle management job at the laundry after sabotaging the purchase of its new facility, and his wife Mary leaves him once she learns of both these actions and his failure to find a new house for the couple. Dawes then approaches Salvatore &quot;Sal&quot; Magliore, the owner of a local used-car dealership with ties to organized crime, in an attempt to obtain explosives. Magliore initially dismisses him as a crackpot, so Dawes assembles a load of Molotov cocktails and uses them to damage the highway construction equipment. He is not caught, but his actions cause only a brief delay in the project. Dawes initially refuses to accept the money being offered by the city for the house under the eminent domain statute, but changes his mind after the city&#x27;s attorney threatens to publicize his brief tryst with Olivia Brenner, a young hitchhiker who had previously taken shelter at the house. Magliore has Dawes&#x27; house checked for listening devices planted by the city and later agrees to sell him a load of explosives. Dawes gives half the money from the house sale to Mary, gives $5,000 to a homeless man in a coffee shop, and has Magliore invest most of the remainder on behalf of Olivia after paying for the explosives.

In January 1974, with only hours remaining before he is required to leave the property, Dawes wires the whole house with the explosives and barricades himself inside. When the police arrive to forcibly evict him, he shoots at them, killing no one but forcing them to take cover and attracting the attention of the media. Dawes coerces the police into letting a reporter - the same one who interviewed him in 1972, though neither recognizes the other - enter and speak to him. Once the reporter has left, Dawes puts on &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; by The Rolling Stones, tosses his guns out the window, and sets off his explosives, destroying the house and killing himself. His last thought is that while the explosion is cataclysmic, it is no bigger &quot;than, say, a good-sized walnut.&quot;

A short epilogue reveals that the reporter and his team ultimately won a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the incident and uncovered the truth about the extension project: there was no real reason for it. Unless the city built a certain number of miles of road per year, it would become ineligible for federal funding of interstate construction projects. The city quietly began preparing to sue Mary for her share of the eminent domain payout, but dropped the suit in the wake of public outcry.

==Author&#x27;s comments==
In the introduction to &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;, King stated: &quot;I think it was an effort to make some sense of my mother&#x27;s painful death the year before – a lingering cancer had taken her off inch by painful inch. Following this death I was left both grieving and shaken by the apparent senselessness of it all... &quot;Roadwork&quot; tries so hard to be good and find some answers to the conundrum of human pain.&quot;

King also described his disappointment with the work, and stated that he was of two minds about having it reprinted, but decided to proceed, in order to give readers an insight into his personality at the time. In a new introduction to the second edition of &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;, King stated that he had changed his mind and that &quot;Roadwork&quot; had become his favorite of the early books.

== Connections to other King works ==

The mangle in the laundromat where Dawes works is nicknamed &quot;The Mangler&quot;, because of &quot;what would happen to you if you ever got caught in it.&quot; King had previously published a short story called &quot;The Mangler&quot; (1972), in which a demon-possessed mangle kills workers in an industrial laundry facility. &quot;Roadwork&quot; relates a story about a .22 caliber, single-shot rifle that Barton Dawes had bought as a boy:

In &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; (1982), Todd Bowden sees an injured blue jay on the ground while cycling; the bird&#x27;s beak opens and closes slowly. In &quot;Desperation&quot; (1996), the character Audrey Wyler recalls:

<text>Ayia Napa ( , ), officially romanised Agia Napa, is a tourist resort at the far eastern end of the southern coast of Cyprus.

== Etymology ==
The name Ayia Napa is derived from a Venetian-era monastery of the same name, located in the centre of the town, next to the square that today is the clubbing centre. The word &quot;Ayia&quot; means &quot;holy&quot; in Greek. &quot;Napa&quot; is archaic and means &quot;wooded valley&quot; or &quot;dell&quot;. In ancient times the area surrounding the town was covered with thick forest.

== Geography ==
Ayia Napa lies near Cape Greco at the eastern part of Cyprus, south of Famagusta, and forms part of a larger area known as &quot;Kokkinochoria&quot; (&quot;Red Villages&quot;, a name derived from the vivid red colour of the soil). It is a town of the Famagusta District, in the remaining Republic of Cyprus-controlled southern part of the district, Ayia Napa is about from Protaras, which has also been developed as a tourist destination.

== History ==
According to a local legend, a hunter in pursuit of his prey discovered an icon of the Virgin Mary in a cave, after which a monastery dedicated to her was built around the cave; the name Virgin Mary of Napa was eventually shortened to Ayia Napa. Another legend has it that a Venetian noblewoman fled from her parents, who forbade her from marrying a commoner, to live there as a nun. The Venetians built a church in  1500. According to local tradition, the area (except for the monastery) was uninhabited until about 1790, when Nikolaos Kemitzis of Thessaloniki arrived from Greece and settled in the village of Panayia, located in the northeastern part of Ayia Napa. Kemitzis had come into conflict with the Ottoman authorities who then ruled Cyprus, and decided to move near the monastery of Ayia Napa.

Between 1999 and 2003, Ayia Napa was the UK garage music summer holiday destination, attracting DJ Spoony, MC Creed, MC DT, Norris &quot;Da Boss&quot; Windross, Kele Le Roc, MC CKP, &quot;Little Charlie&quot;, and &quot;So Solid Crew&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;i-D/ukg-documentary-garage&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theneweuropean/village-to-heart-of-garage&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Ayia Napa was given the status of a main city-urban centre by the Government of Cyprus, in recognition of its importance to the economy. This was credited to the efforts of Mayor Yiannis Karousos, elected in March 2013. The city of Ayia Napa has the seventh largest budget of the 30 active municipalities of Cyprus, and employs 280 people.

== Government ==
The City of Ayia Napa is governed by a mayor, an alderman, and a six-member city council; Christos Zannetou was elected mayor in January 2020. It is well known for its municipal management, which has influenced that of other local authorities in Cyprus.

=== Public beaches ===
Until the end of 2014, beaches in Cyprus were under the management of private individuals and companies which were given licences to manage the beaches directly and without public tenders. Mayor Yiannis Karousos led an initiative to place all the city&#x27;s beaches under direct city management. Ηe and the councillors who voted for the proposal faced threats and legal actions, but the city received over 3.5 million euros in annual revenue from beaches, and all beaches in Cyprus are now managed by the local authorities.

=== Participatory budget ===
In October 2017, the city decided that €240,000 of its development budget will be allocated to projects proposed and chosen by citizens and organisations of Ayia Napa, becoming the first city in Cyprus to implement a participatory budget.

=== Live webcast ===
In January 2017, Ayia Napa become the first city council in Cyprus to transmit a live webcast of its council meetings.

=== Annual survey ===
Starting in 2017, the city instituted an annual survey of citizens, businesses, and visitors evaluating the city and giving feedback.

=== City improvement app ===
Through an online app, citizens and visitors can report issues and make complaints and track how long it takes the city to fix the problem.

=== Blockchain and smart city ===
On 2 May 2018, the city signed an agreement with the University of Nicosia under which the university will act as consultant to the city in implementing blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and smart city utilities; it is the first city in Cyprus to implement blockchain technology.

== Tourism ==
===Overview===

Ayia Napa is the largest tourist resort in Cyprus, with a 27,000-person-bed capacity and more than 175 hotels and apartments of all sizes. In 2017, the resort received over 700,000 tourists and accommodated 5 million overnight stays, representing approximately 30% of all Cyprus overnight stays.

Beginning in the 2010s, under Mayor Yiannis Karousos, the city has sought to expand tourist offerings and declared an aim of discouraging rowdy groups of young tourists and becoming &quot;the best and most cosmopolitan tourist resort of the Mediterranean&quot; by 2030. Since 2013, it has shut down problematic establishments, upgraded infrastructure, hotels, and restaurants, and added facilities such as a new marina and the underwater museum. The vision set by the city is supported by the Cyprus Tourism Strategy, which was completed in March 2017 and aims for Ayia Napa to be &quot;regarded as one of Europe&#x27;s top three beach and nightclubbing holiday destinations [...] offering the best beach and marine experience in Cyprus for young adults, complemented by international standard beach clubs and nightlife&quot;. The strategy evaluated the then quality of Ayia Napa as 3.4/5 and proposed that it should plan to increase its quality to 4.4/5.

Ayia Napa was recognised as a &quot;Prime City Destination&quot; by the Oxford Business Assembly, and in 2018 was awarded the International flag of investment and innovation attractiveness &#x27;Flag of Europe&quot; and the International Certificate of Excellence in Investment and Innovation (ICEII).

=== Beaches ===
The resort has 27 beaches, of which 14 have been awarded the Blue Flag award, more than any other resort in Cyprus; the island itself also has the second highest amount of Blue Flags in the world, behind only Croatia. In 2011, Nissi Beach topped the TripAdvisor list of the best beaches in Europe. In 2017, Makronissos Beach was chosen by &quot;Travel Weekly&quot; as the third best beach for Cyprus and Greece. In 2018, it was announced that Nissi Beach ranked third in the list of the most popular beaches on Instagram. A CNN feature ranked Nissi Beach as the best beach to visit for the month of July 2018.

=== Marina ===

The foundation stone for Ayia Napa Marina was laid on 30 September 2016. It was the largest private project in Cyprus at the time and is expected to cost €250 million and be completed in 2021. The main investor is Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris, who was presented with a golden key to the city by Mayor Yiannis Karousos at the foundation ceremony.

== Cultural sites and events ==
=== Sites ===
Ayia Napa medieval monastery is the main point of significant historical interest in the Ayia Napa area. The oldest parts of the existing monastery are some wall sections from the Middle Byzantine era (before 1191); most of the buildings are from the 14th–18th centuries. It now houses a museum.

The Makronissos Tombs are an archaeological site consisting of set of ancient rock-cut tombs, an adjacent sanctuary and quarry, and evidence of funeral pyres.

The town contains two municipal marine museums: the Tornaritis-Pierides Museum of Marine Life and the Thalassa Agia Napa Municipal Museum (also known as the Thalassa Museum of the Sea). The former, founded in 1992, displays marine fossils, specimens, and dioramas. The latter, founded in 2005, displays the &quot;marine heritage of Cyprus, from prehistoric times to the present&quot; and features a full-scale replica of a  300 BCE merchant ship which was salvaged during the 1960s.

The Ayia Napa Sculpture Park, on the east side of the city, was inaugurated in May 2014 with 17 sculptures. By January 2018 it included more than 200 sculptures by 140 sculptors from all over the world. The sculpture park was accepted as a member to the International Sculpture Symposium Alliance, and has been turned into an international attraction, with the participation of artists from all over the world.

The Museum of Underwater Sculptures Ayia Napa, with 93 works by British sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor off Pernera Beach, opened in 2021. Sculptures are at a depth of , accessible to both snorkellers and scuba divers. It is the first of its kind in the Mediterranean. (link below) 

=== Monuments ===
&quot;The Fisherman of Ayia Napa&quot;, inaugurated in June 2015, is dedicated to the fishermen of the world. The population of Ayia Napa once consisted of mainly fishermen and farmers.

&quot;The Mermaid of Ayia Napa&quot;, a sculpture at the harbour inaugurated in 2015, was inspired by the poetry of George Seferis and by the legendary sister of Alexander the Great. She has two tails.
&quot;The Farmer of Ayia Napa&quot;, inaugurated in July 2016 in a square created on Yiannaki Pappoulis Street as part of the initiatives to improve the city centre.

&quot;Kemitzides, the Family of Ayia Napa&quot;, a group of three statues donated to the city by five local families and inaugurated in September 2016: a man in Greek dress, a classic Cypriot woman, and a child, commemorating the founding family of the city and symbolising their continuation.

&quot;From Yorgopotamos to El Alamein&quot;, dedicated to the citizens of Ayia Napa who participated in the First and Second World Wars and inaugurated in October 2016 in the presence of the Minister of Defence.

=== Festivals ===
The Ayia Napa International Festival, first held in September 1985, is held annually in Seferis Square in Ayia Napa Monastery, usually over the last weekend of September. The festivities reflect the historic, cultural and agricultural traditions of Ayia Napa and Cyprus as a whole. The programme includes theater performances, operas, concerts, and Cypriot and foreign folk dancing. Visitors can also enjoy art and photo exhibitions, wood carving and silversmithing workshops, and culinary shows with halloumi cheese making.

The Ayia Napa Youth Festival was established in 2010 when the Ayia Napa Youth Council accepted the proposal of its president Yiannis Karousos and decided to organise a festival similar to the large music festivals of Europe. The festival is based on several principles such as free entrance, the headliners to be chosen by the public, a charity goal, and a social responsibility message. All styles of music are welcome. The first festival took place at the harbour square and received more than 10,000 visitors over three days; bands included the Greek reggae act Locomondo, pop-rock band MPLE, and hip hop band Stavento featuring Ivi Adamou. In 2011, the festival became international and included Stratovarius, Sabaton, Rotting Christ, Nightstalker, and other bands from all over Europe. The 3rd Ayia Napa Youth Festival took place in 2012.

=== Greek dancing world record ===
On 16 September 2007, following the proposal of Yiannis Karousos, who was then president of the Ayia Napa Tourism Committee, the world&#x27;s longest chain of syrtaki dancers danced in synchronised step to &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; in a successful attempt to enter the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. The chain had a total of 268 members of eight dancing groups. Ayia Napa mayor Antonis Tsokkos said the aim of the event was to send the message that the area was interested in Greek culture and to promote the tourist resort abroad. The event drew the attention of tourists and locals, many of whom danced on the beach and in the sea.

== Points of interest ==
=== Amusement parks ===
The town has an amusement park called Parko Paliatso and a water park called WaterWorld. WaterWorld has a theme of Ancient Greece, and opened on 7 April 1996.

<text>Charles Edwin Stone (4 February 1889 – 29 August 1952) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Stone was born in the town of Ripley in Derbyshire. When he was 29 years old, and a gunner in &#x27;C&#x27; Battery 83rd Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, British Army during the First World War, the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 March 1918 at Caponne Farm, France, after working at his gun for six hours under heavy gas and shell fire, Gunner Stone was sent back to the rear with an order. He delivered it and then, under a very heavy barrage, returned with a rifle to assist in holding up the enemy on a sunken road. First lying in the open under very heavy machine-gun fire and then on the right flank of the two rear guns he held the enemy at bay. Later he was one of the party which captured a machine-gun and four prisoners.

He later achieved the rank of Bombardier. His brother Ernest was killed in 1917. Stone is buried in Belper in Derbyshire

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, England.

<text>Tété-Michel Kpomassie is an explorer and writer from Togo, and the author of &quot;An African in Greenland&quot;.

== Biography ==
Kpomassie was born in 1941, in Togo, and received only six years of elementary education. His father, a prominent man in the village, had eight wives and 26 children. When he was a young man, he was collecting coconuts in a tree when he was surprised by a python, and fell to the ground. His father believed that his resulting illness could only be cured by consulting the priestess of the python cult, deep in the forest, and so he was taken, through one long night, into the heart of the snake-infested cult. The cure worked, but the priestess required a payment - Kpomassie would need to be initiated into the snake cult. This would require living for the next seven years in the jungle, among the snakes.

It was at this time, recovering from his illness and waiting to be taken back to the jungle, that Kpomassie found a children&#x27;s book (The Eskimos from Greenland to Alaska by Dr. Robert Gessain) at the local Jesuit library about Greenland. Not only did this strange country have no snakes, but it had no trees in which they might hide. He fell immediately in love with the country and the idea of its native hunters. As soon as he was well, he ran away from home, with the sole idea of somehow reaching Greenland.

For the next twelve years he traveled, refusing to stay in one place more than six months, and worked his way through the countries of West Africa, into Europe, and finally, in the mid-1960s, found a boat to Greenland. All the while, he taught himself languages through correspondence courses and made an endless number of friends through his skills as a story-teller and natural charm. The story of his adventures in Greenland can be found in his book, published in France in 1977, &quot;An African in Greenland&quot;. 

Kpomassie was awarded the Prix Littéraire Francophone International in 1981. In 2003, Leonard Lopate interviewed Kpomassie on WNYC for &quot;The Leonard Lopate Show&quot;.

In New York City, in September 2009, the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts and Flux Factory organized an exhibition called Arctic Book Club centered on the book, with Kpomassie himself as the guest of honor.

Kpomassie currently lives in Nanterre, near Paris, France, but continues to regularly visit Greenland and his native country of Togo.

<doc id="1208798" wikidata="Q17041232" url="?curid=1208798" title="Omukama of Bunyoro">
<text>Omukama wa Bunyoro (translates to the King of Bunyoro) is the title given to rulers of the East African kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara. The kingdom lasted as an independent state from the 16th to the 19th century. The Omukama of Bunyoro remains an important figure in Ugandan politics, especially among the Banyoro people of whom he is the titular head. He is closely related to the Omukama of Tooro Kingdom.

The Royal Palace, called &quot;Ekikaali Karuziika&quot; (Karuziika Palace), is located in Hoima. The current Omukama is Rukirabasaija Solomon Iguru I Gafabusa Amooti and his wife is Omugo (the Queen) Margaret Karunga Adyeri. As a cultural head, the King is assisted by his Principal Private Secretary, a Cabinet of 21 Ministers and &quot;Orukurato&quot; (a Parliament).

==Constitutional recognition==
In 1962, the United Kingdom granted independence to Uganda. In February 1966, Prime Minister Milton Obote suspended the constitution and seized power, abolishing all of the traditional kingdoms—including Bunyoro—in 1967. The Omukama (King) of Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom was reinstated by Statute No. 8 of 1993, enacted by the Parliament of Uganda after the monarchy had been abolished for many years. Unlike the pre-1967 Omukama, who was both titular head and a political figure of the government of Bunyoro, the Omukama today is a cultural leader above partisan politics, although the king remains the titular head of the Bunyoro regional government.

Article 246 of the 1995 Ugandan constitution provides:

&lt;poem&gt;
246. Institution of traditional or cultural leaders.
 (1) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the institution of traditional leader or cultural leader may exist in any area of Uganda in accordance with the culture, customs and traditions or wishes and aspirations of the people to whom it applies.
 (2) In any community, where the issue of traditional or cultural leader has not been resolved, the issue shall be resolved by the community concerned using a method prescribed by Parliament.
 (3) The following provisions shall apply in relation to traditional leaders or cultural leaders—
 (a) the institution of traditional leader or a cultural leader shall be a corporation sole with perpetual succession and with capacity to sue and be sued and to hold assets or properties in trust for itself and the people concerned;
 (b) nothing in paragraph (a) shall be taken to prohibit a traditional leader or cultural leader from holding any asset or property acquired in a personal capacity;
 (c) a traditional leader or cultural leader shall enjoy such privileges and benefits as may be conferred by the Government and local government or as that leader may be entitled to under culture, custom and tradition;
 (d) subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, no person shall be compelled to pay allegiance or contribute to the cost of maintaining a traditional leader or cultural leader;
 (e) a person shall not, while remaining a traditional leader or cultural leader, join or participate in partisan politics;
 (f) a traditional leader or cultural leader shall not have or exercise any administrative, legislative or executive powers of Government or local government.
 (4) The allegiance and privileges accorded to a traditional leader or a cultural leader by virtue of that office shall not be regarded as a discriminatory practice prohibited under article 21 of this Constitution; but any custom, practice, usage or tradition relating to a traditional leader or cultural leader which detracts from the rights of any person as guaranteed by this Constitution, shall be taken to be prohibited under that article.
 (5) For the avoidance of doubt, the institution of traditional leader or cultural leader existing immediately before the coming into force of this Constitution shall be taken to exist in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.
 (6) For the purposes of this article, &quot;traditional leader or cultural leader&quot; means a king or similar traditional leader or cultural leader by whatever name called, who derives allegiance from the fact of birth or descent in accordance with the customs, traditions, usage or consent of the people led by that traditional or cultural leader.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Etymology of Omukama==
 means ‘the milker’, as the leader of the kingdom provides his citizens with food and wealth. The word comes from Runyoro-Rutooro &quot;omu-&quot; (singular human-being class prefix) and &quot;-kama&quot; ‘to milk’, which ultimately comes from Proto-Bantu ‘squeeze, wring’.

In modern Runyoro-Rutooro, however, dropping the initial vowel of this word (&quot;mukama&quot; ‘boss, sir’) changes its meaning considerably.

==History of the Omukama of Bunyoro-Kitara dynasties==

===Babiito dynasty===
The Bachwezi dynasty was followed by the Babiito dynasty of the current Omukama of Bunyoro-Kitara. Any attempt to pinpoint the dates of this, or any other dynasty before it, is pure conjecture; as there were no written records at the time. Modern day historians place the beginning of the Babiito dynasty at around the time of the invasion of Bunyoro by the Luo from the North. The first mubiito (singular) king was Isingoma Mpuga Rukidi I, whose reign is placed around the 14th century. To date, there have been a total of 27 Babiito kings of Bunyoro-Kitara.

<doc id="1208810" wikidata="Q7622298" url="?curid=1208810" title="Stratus VOS">
<text>Stratus VOS (Virtual Operating System) is a proprietary operating system running on Stratus Technologies fault-tolerant computer systems. VOS is available on Stratus&#x27;s ftServer and Continuum platforms. VOS customers use it to support high-volume transaction processing applications which require continuous availability. VOS is notable for being one of the few operating systems which run on fully lockstepped hardware.

During the 1980s, an IBM version of Stratus VOS existed and was called the System/88 Operating System.

==History==
VOS was designed from its inception as a high-security transaction-processing environment tailored to fault-tolerant hardware. It incorporates much of the design experience that came out of the MIT/Bell-Laboratories/General-Electric (later Honeywell) Multics project.

In 1984, Stratus added a UNIX System V implementation called Unix System Facilities (USF) to VOS, integrating Unix and VOS at the kernel level.

In recent years, Stratus has added POSIX-compliance, and many open source packages can run on VOS.

Like competing proprietary operating systems, VOS has seen its market share shrink steadily in the 1990s, and early 2000s.

==Development==

===Programming for VOS===
VOS provides compilers for PL/I, COBOL, Pascal, FORTRAN, C (with the VOS C and GCC compilers), and C++ (also GCC). Each of these programming languages can make VOS system calls (e.g. codice_1 to read a record from a file), and has extensions to support varying-length strings in PL/I style. Developers typically code in their favourite VOS text editor, or offline, before compiling on the system; there are no VOS IDE applications.

In its history, Stratus has offered hardware platforms based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor family (&quot;FT&quot; and &quot;XA&quot; series), the Intel i860 microprocessor family (&quot;XA/R&quot; series), the HP PA-RISC processor family (&quot;Continuum&quot; series), and the Intel Xeon x86 processor family (&quot;V Series&quot;). All versions of VOS offer compilers targeted at the native instruction set, and some versions of VOS offer cross-compilers.

Stratus added support for the POSIX API in VOS Release 14.3 (on Continuum), and added support for the GNU C/C++ compiler, GNU gdb debugger, and many POSIX commands in VOS Release 14.4. Each additional release of VOS has added more POSIX.1 capabilities, to the point where many user-mode open-source packages can now be successfully built. For this reason, beginning with Release 17.0, Stratus renamed VOS to OpenVOS.

Stratus offers supported ports of Samba, OpenSSL, OpenSSH, GNU Privacy Guard, OpenLDAP, Berkeley DB, MySQL Community Server, Apache, IBM WebSphere MQ, and the community edition of Java.

Numeric values in VOS are always big endian, regardless of the endianness of the underlying hardware platform. On little endian servers with x86 processors, the compilers do a byte swap before reading or writing values to memory to transform the data to or from the native little endian format.

===Command Macro Language===
VOS has a fairly complete command macro language which can be used to create menu systems, automate tasks etc. VOS command macros accept arguments on the command-line or via a user interface &quot;form&quot;. Arguments are defined at the beginning of the command macro in a &quot;parameters&quot; section. The language supports a range of statements, including if/then/else, Boolean operations, &quot;while&quot; loops, &quot;goto&quot; and excellent error reporting. The command macro language can be executed in interactive and non-interactive (batch or started process) modes. It can be used to automate programs, capturing prompts and sending appropriate responses. This has led Stratus to limit the capabilities of the command macro language.

The macro language lacks support for user-defined functions and does not easily support include files. The string handling is prone to errors, especially with embedded control characters.

A Visual Studio Code Syntax Highlighting extension for VOS Command Macro can be found on the Visual Studio Marketplace.

==Overview==
VOS was coded mainly in PL/I with a small amount of assembly language before it was migrated to ftServer series. As of 1991, the system was written in PL/I and C, with only 3% in assembly.

Its overall structure has much in common with Multics, and many of the system&#x27;s features can be traced back to Multics to varying degrees. The system exposes a number of fundamental abstractions to the software designer or programmer, most notable being
*Processes
*Devices
*Hard Disks
*Various IPC mechanisms
*Tasks

A process is the scheduled entity in VOS, and each process has a set of attributes that govern how it is manipulated by the system. For example, processes have a &quot;user name&quot; and &quot;process name&quot;. The former is used by VOS to determine the process&#x27;s access rights to external devices, and items with the file system. Of fundamental significance is a process&#x27;s privileged flag, which is a binary attribute. Privileged processes may perform privileged operations. This mechanism is used to restrict certain potentially powerful operations that can have system wide consequences (e.g. shutting down the system, dismounting a hard disk etc.).

==Distribution==
VOS is distributed only by Stratus Technologies. The distribution media is a 3.5 mm DAT tape for Continuum, and an SDLT tape for early V Series platforms. As of OpenVOS Release 17.0, Stratus offers support for distributing OpenVOS on a DVD or by downloading a release file. Software installations may be done by the Stratus Field Engineer or by the customer&#x27;s system administrator.

==Interface==
The command-line interface is the main, and most powerful, user interface for a VOS system.

Users may be locked into &quot;form&quot; based sub-system by command macro scripts if required, although a skilled user would be able to break out of this and get command-line access. (It is, in fact, possible for a Stratus system administrator to set up a user&#x27;s account such that an attempt to break out of FMS—the Stratus Forms Management System—to the command line results in the user being logged out.)

Command macros and programs can be invoked with an argument to display a form listing all the available parameters, which the user can navigate using the &quot;tab&quot; key. Each parameter is generally restricted to control what the user can input. This includes lists of valid values, numeric-only, text-only, etc. Parameters can also be hidden using a &quot;secret&quot; tag, or made mandatory.

All commands in VOS are defined in full with underbars to separate words. For example, changes the working directory. The VOS help system uses this convention to assist users who are looking for a subset of possible commands; for instance, those referring to &quot;change&quot; are found by .

Users may customize their command interface by means of a file that contains abbreviations for commands. Command abbreviations are conventionally named after the first letters of the command they represent, so may be expanded to .

==Applications==

===System applications===
VOS is used on Continuum and ftServer systems, both of which are designed to be highly fault-tolerant. As such, these systems are typically used in safety-critical or mission-critical applications, typically banks, hospitals, telecommunications and transaction processing companies.

===Communications===
VOS supports the following protocols

*TCP/IP
*X.25
*SNA
*SDLC/QLLC
*Async
*Bisync
*LAPB
*Poll/Select
*RJE/HASP
*ALC/SLC
*Visa, S.W.I.F.T., NASDAQ, FAS, CHIPS, AMEX
*MQ Series

Older versions of VOS implemented a non-OSI standard TCP/IP known as OS TCP/IP (Operating System TCP/IP.) VOS since version 14.x has implemented OSI-compliant Streams-TCP. Older applications using OS TCP/IP have to be ported in order to use STCP. This can mean a loss of functionality as OS TCP/IP supported several functions that are not OSI-compliant and have therefore been abandoned. The ftServer hardware that V Series runs on only supports TCP/IP and X.25 (X.25 only when equipped with the optional NIO.) Websphere MQ 6.0 (a.k.a. MQ Series) is TCP/IP based; so, that is also supported by ftServer hardware. Devices supporting the legacy protocols run on the Continuum hardware and may be accessed from current hardware over the Open StrataLINK network.

==Fault tolerance==

Fault tolerance is built into VOS from the bottom up. On a hardware level, major devices are run in lockstepped duplex mode, meaning that there are two identical devices performing the same action at the same time. (In addition, each device, or board, is also duplexed in order to identify internal board failures at a hardware level, which is why Stratus hardware can be defined as &quot;lock stepped&quot;.) These boards are actively monitored by the operating system which can correct any minor inconsistencies (such as bad disk-writes or reads). Any boards which report an unacceptable number of faults are removed from service by the system; the duplexed board will continue operation until the problem is resolved via a hot-fix. This includes CPUs, disk drives, and any other device that can logically be duplexed (which by definition, excludes communications devices). The system will continue processing as normal and will automatically raise a fault ticket with Stratus Customer Service via RSN (the Remote Service Network). Stratus Customer Service will then dial into the system using RSN to investigate the problem and dispatch replacement parts.

The operating system is designed to avoid crashes due to a simplexed hardware failure.

==File system==
VOS supports a number of unique file types:
* Stream files: a stream of binary data, corresponding directly with the concept of a file on other operating systems.
* Fixed files: a sequence of records of a fixed size.
* Relative files: a sequence of records of a fixed file supporting random access
* Sequential files: a sequence of records of variable size
* Queue files: file-system based backup for message queues
* Pipes: named pipes for inter-process communication
* Transaction files: these provide support for journal based rollback
The VOS API allows the creation of multiple indexes per file, sorting according to the contents of a record, or an external key, or an internal key, or a well-defined set of multiple keys. A VOS file with one or more indexes can be used as a C-ISAM database table.

VOS uses a proprietary file naming syntax which includes the system name, module name, disk number, and directory, with components separated by the &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol. Typically the system disk will be housed in the same module as the CPU, codice_2, so a system file for a VOS cluster would be referenced as

 (%system)#m1_d01&gt;system&gt;devices.table

VOS disk allocation and memory is organised in &quot;blocks&quot;, each block being 4,096 bytes. Memory takes the form of RAM or paging. VOS systems support paging partitions and paging files. In modern versions of VOS, paging files can be created dynamically by the SysAdmin (but not removed without a reboot). These paging files can in theory consist of more than one extent (which is viewed by the kernel as a mini-paging partition) which may or may not be contiguous. However, non-contiguous extents are NOT recommended as they greatly increase disk activity. Admin should create the largest possible extent for the paging files as early as possible after the system has been booted.

===File system security===
VOS supports write, read, execute, and null (no) access to all files, directories and devices (although directories and files have slightly different access lists). Access can be assigned to users, groups, or the world. Only read access is required to run an executable program, provided that the user has &quot;status&quot; access for the directory in which that program resides.

VOS inherited access control lists from Multics and also implements directory access control lists. If a file does not have an access control list, the containing directory&#x27;s default access control list applies.

Access to devices is typically controlled by creating a file which is linked to the device by the administrator. (This may be true in OpenVOS, but does not apply to the original operating system.) Access is then given to this file, and this sets the access on the device.

==Open StrataLINK==
VOS has always been a network-aware operating system. Virtually every system call in the native API has a parameter that determines what computer the operation affects. If the operation isn&#x27;t local, it is redirected to the target computer via remote subroutine call. For example, file names are parsed to indicate which computer the file resides on.

The StrataLINK networking model has a two level hierarchy for naming computers: Each computer is called a &quot;module&quot; and &quot;modules&quot; are aggregated into &quot;systems&quot;. Each &quot;system&quot; is administered as a unit. In other words, all of the modules in a system are aware of all the disks and hardware devices on that system. The result of this is that a file name that begins with the system name refers to files on other computers and can be opened without the need for any special networking. The same is true for devices. Other system entities, such as processes, are referenced using &quot;module names&quot; which are written %&quot;system&quot;#&quot;module&quot;. The VOS system and module names have no defined relationship with IP addresses or domain names—The VOS API was developed in late 1980—before the Internet was widely adopted and long before URLs were even invented.

Historically, StrataLINK was a proprietary 10Mb CSMA/CD ring network which allowed high performance (for the time) with very low memory overhead and CPU utilization. This was never developed beyond 10Mb and was dropped in favor of using TCP/IP because Ethernet became the dominant networking standard and because memory and CPU processing got cheaper.

Open StrataLINK can also use X.25 for wide area communications. Using the Open StrataLINK protocols for wide area communications is also referred to as StrataNET.

<text>Percy Valentine Storkey, VC (9 September 1893 – 3 October 1969) was a New Zealand-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Napier in New Zealand, Storkey moved to Australia in 1911. He was a law student at the University of Sydney when the First World War began. He volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in May 1915 and was posted to the 19th Battalion. He saw action on the Western Front, including during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. It was during the German spring offensive of 1918 that he performed the actions that led to his award of the VC. He finished the war as a captain. Discharged from the AIF, Storkey returned to his legal studies and became a crown prosecutor for the New South Wales Department of Justice. Shortly before the Second World War, he was appointed a district court judge and served in this capacity until his retirement in 1955. He moved to England where he died in 1969 at the age of 78.

==Early life==
Percy Storkey was born on 9 September 1893 in Napier, New Zealand, to Samuel Storkey, an Englishman who worked as a printer and his New Zealand-born wife, Sarah . Samuel Storkey had moved to Napier as a young boy with his father William. Percy Storkey was educated at Napier Boys&#x27; High School, where he was dux of the school in his final year, and later Victoria College in Wellington, where he studied fine arts. As a teenager, Storkey served in the Territorial Force as an infantryman with the Wellington Regiment, eventually achieving the rank of colour sergeant after five years of service.

In around 1911 or 1912, Storkey moved to Sydney in Australia and worked as a clerk for a steamship company. Within a year he was on the administrative staff at the University of Sydney. He then enrolled in the university&#x27;s law school but the First World War curtailed his studies.

==First World War==
Storkey enlisted for service in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 10 May 1915. Prior to his commissioning on 24 September as a second lieutenant, he served as a platoon sergeant in the 30th Battalion. He embarked for England aboard the &quot;Suevic&quot; at the end of the year but not before his former colleagues at the University of Sydney presented him with a wristwatch. and was posted to the 19th Battalion, then stationed on the Western Front in France, in mid-November 1916. He was wounded in the thigh during fighting at Flers, on the Somme, within days of joining the battalion. Promoted to lieutenant in January 1917, he was wounded again, in the ankle, in October 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele while on the Menin Road. The following month, having returned to duty, he was given temporary command of a company.

On 21 March 1918, the Germans began their huge Spring Offensive and the 19th Battalion, as part of the 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division, helped in shoring up the front-lines as the Germans advanced. On 7 April 1918, while holding the lines near Villers-Bretonneux, his company, with Storkey as its second-in-command, was sent forward to clear Hangard Wood, believed to be lightly held by the enemy. The company commenced its advance early in the morning after a covering artillery barrage lifted, but Storkey had fallen asleep and was left behind at the starting line. He shortly woke and quickly caught up with the advance, about ahead. By this time, machine gun fire had caused a quarter of the company to become casualties, including its commander, Captain Clarrie Wallach. Taking command, Storkey led a small party on a foray to outflank the machine gun post that was holding up the advance. Despite being detected as they approached, he seized the initiative and led a prompt charge that saw his party capture a machine gun along with 50 Germans and killing or wounding about 30 more. His conduct leading the attack had deceived the Germans into believing the size of the force facing them was much larger than it was.

The position secured, the Australians pushed on further into the wood but were unable to locate their objective. Storkey, considering the available options for cover too exposed, opted to withdraw the company back to their starting positions. On reporting to his battalion commander, he was ordered to retake the position but advised that he had too few men to so. His explanation was accepted and Storkey returned to his trench. Over 150 soldiers of the company had become casualties of the attack, but it had resulted in useful information on the German forces at Hangard Wood.

For his actions at Hangard Wood, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). At the time, the VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Storkey&#x27;s VC, published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, read:

Later wounded for a third time, Storkey was promoted to captain the following month and given command of his own company. On 25 July 1918, King George V presented him with his VC at Buckingham Palace. As part of a special furlough, he returned to Australia in November 1918 and was discharged from the AIF in January the following year by which time the war was over due to the armistice. He was allocated to the Reserve of Officers in July 1920.

==Later life==

Returning to civilian life, Storkey resumed his legal studies. In May 1919 he was made an associate to Judge Langer Owen of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and then worked for Justice Charles Wade. He qualified as a lawyer in 1921 and briefly worked in private practice before becoming a crown prosecutor for the New South Wales Department of Justice; his jurisdiction covering the south-western area of the state. He fulfilled this role for several years until his appointment as a district court judge in May 1939, the first VC recipient to become a member of the bench. He presided over trials in the northern district of New South Wales. Prior to his appointment to the judiciary, he briefly worked for the legal department of the Australian Army. He was also involved in the Returned Soldier&#x27;s League and became the president of the sub-branch in Vaucluse, the suburb of Sydney where he lived.

In 1955 Storkey retired and moved to England where he lived in Teddington, Middlesex, with Minnie , his English-born wife, whom he had married in 1922 in Sydney. The next year, he attended the VC centenary celebrations in London. He died at home on 3 October 1969, survived by his wife. The couple had no children. He was cremated and his ashes scattered at South West Middlesex Crematorium. The machine gun captured during the action at Hangard Wood that saw him awarded the VC is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where a street is also named for him.

==Medal==
Storkey left his VC, along with his Victory Medal, British War Medal, and medals from the 1937 and 1953 coronations, to his old school, Napier Boys&#x27; High School. In 1983 there was a controversy when the school Parents&#x27; League wanted to sell the VC to finance student scholarships but backed down in the face of public protests. Eventually the medals were transferred to the National Army Museum at Waiouru, where they are displayed on a long-term loan. A replica of his VC is also on display in the foyer of the assembly hall at Napier Boys&#x27; High School.

<doc id="1208818" wikidata="Q7767245" url="?curid=1208818" title="The Sum of Our Discontent">
<text>The Sum of Our Discontent is a nonfiction book by David Boyle. It was published by Texere in 2001. The tagline and theme of the book is &quot;Why numbers make us irrational&quot;.

==Premise==

The author&#x27;s premise is that humans have been trying to improve the quality of life and happiness by using numbers to count an increasing amount of things, and while it has worked in many ways, it has also had a cost in sanitizing the representation of existence by trying to reduce everything to numbers, and has not often been very effective. This tension is very similar to the one described in the classic &quot;The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution&quot; of C. P. Snow.

==Synopsis==

The first chapter is entitled &quot;A Short History of Counting&quot;. It describes the progression of numbers from being considered divine in early history to their present-day pragmatism. It opens in 1904 Berlin with the story of a counting horse named Clever Hans, who was, to the relief of all, proved by psychologist Oskar Pfungst to not really be able to count. This fit in with the earlier opinion of Nicholas of Cusa, a cardinal who was a pioneer of quantification, that counting is what separates man from animals.

Boyle then covers the history of counting in detail, starting with when numbers were considered to be divine and were the exclusive domain of the accountant-priests of the Assyrian Empire, then going on to Pythagoras and the Ancient Greeks who believed numbers represented the harmony of nature. Legend has it that Pythagoras may have studied with the Magi and been influenced by them after having been held captive in Babylon. Even a later practical and scientific mathematician such as Heinrich Hertz agreed with this natural significance of numbers. Boyle then goes to the medieval fascination and obsession with clocks that are thought to have possibly been invented by Gerbert of Aurillac, a monk. The long and fascinating history of the abacus also turns up time and time again in counting history. Luca Pacioli&#x27;s invention of double-entry accounting further brought us to the present day situation of numbers being used to measure everything.

The next chapters tell the stories of various historical figures and how they relate to the book&#x27;s concept. They are all good stories; many of them focus on the unintended consequences of the ideas of their creators, specifically Thomas Malthus and John Maynard Keynes, who have both become known as measurers, but were really more interested in unmeasurable concepts. It all starts with eccentric Jeremy Bentham who tried to measure happiness, then progresses to his utilitarian followers John Stuart Mill and Thomas Malthus. One problem with counting that became evident from this era was that it gave no solutions or causality, just data. Next he describes the political self-esteem movement started by California politician John Vasconcellos in consultation with his friend Jack Canfield, author of the popular self-esteem self-help book &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot;. A lot of Vasconcellous&#x27; ideas came from the Esalen Institute in the mountains near Big Sur, where Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of human needs theory was popularized. Boyle then tells the interesting story of Frederick Winslow Taylor and his extremely number-oriented scientific management. He then covers the ethical investing fad, an attempt to measure by more than numbers that itself falls victim to counting irrationality. Next is the story of economist John Maynard Keynes.

The chapter on &quot;New Indicators&quot; describes attempts to replace GNP with broader measures such as the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) that attempt to account for full environmental costs. That index was popularized in a 1994 article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly &quot;by Clifford Cobb about his new Redefining Progress think tank. Hazel Henderson&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Politics for the Solar Age&quot; was responsible for sparking the creation of the Air Pollution Index, one of many quality of life measurements that are now proliferating. An interesting point is that such measurements are often most meaningful if created and made by the people who care about them.

The next chapter covers the story of Edgar S. Cahn who came up with the time dollar as an outgrowth of his battles with proponents of cost–benefit analysis but more importantly from his desire to make people feel valuable. The initial time dollar projects began in 1987 with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The book ends with a chapter named &quot;The bottom line&quot;. Boyle summarizes how the practice of trying to measure everything (which used to go by the name pantometry but is now so common that the word has fallen out of use) can rob us of our humanity. Measuring is very necessary, but so is intuition and storytelling, which can often express points much better than numbers can. He thinks we should try to bridge the gap between the eastern and western view of numbers, which have been in conflict since Pythagoras. He ends with a relevant quote from Prince Charles from his millennium broadcast on the BBC. Boyle&#x27;s bottom line is that measuring does not in itself improve anything.

<text>John Andrew Leslie (born 25 November 1970 in Lower Hutt, New Zealand) is a former rugby union footballer who played at centre for Scotland. He is the elder son of Andy Leslie the great All Blacks captain and the brother of Martin Leslie who also played for Scotland. He was educated at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Silverstream, and completed a BPhEd at the University of Otago in 1994.

Leslie played 123 games for Otago and 32 for the Highlanders in the Super 12. He led Otago to the National Provincial Championship title in 1998.

In the 1994 South African tour of New Zealand, Otago beat South Africa for the first time to secure the Springbok head. John Leslie running on an angle scored Otago&#x27;s only try under the posts in very wet conditions in the 19–12 victory.

Leslie qualified for Scotland through a paternal grandfather and initially joined Glasgow Caledonians, making his international debut along with his brother against South Africa in November 1998. Shortly after his debut, he joined the Fukuoka Sanix Bombs club in Japan.

The Leslie brothers joined a line of New Zealanders to play for Scotland, dubbed the &quot;Kilted Kiwis&quot;, they include: Brendan Laney, Glenn Metcalfe, Gordon Simpson and Sean Lineen – the original Kilted Kiwi.

In the 1999 Five Nations championship, Leslie scored the fastest ever try against Wales, touching down after ten seconds after the kick-off. He was voted Man of the Tournament.

In January 2000, the SRU were keen for Leslie to be closer to Scotland, he quit Sanix signing for Newcastle Falcons in England.

In September 2000, Leslie joined Northampton Saints.

After the 2002 Six Nations championship Leslie retired from international rugby.

At the end of the 2003/04 season John was released by Northampton Saints, when he returned to Otago and New Zealand.

In October 2004 Leslie retired, playing his last match for Otago.

Since retiring, Leslie co-coached a team at the University of Otago RFC with Josh Kronfeld.

Since 2006 to present Leslie now runs the LeslieRugby Business. A rugby product business based in Dunedin, New Zealand.

Leslie also runs one-day training programmes of rugby skill coaching and drill training for children and coaches across New Zealand.

For the 2022 club rugby season, Leslie is returning to coaching, this time with Southern Rugby Football Club, with former All Blacks Kees Meeuws and Jamie Joseph.

<text>Johan August Hugo Gyldén (May 29, 1841 in Helsinki – November 9, 1896 in Stockholm) was a Finland-Swedish astronomer primarily known for work in celestial mechanics.

Gyldén was the son of Nils Abraham Gyldén, Professor of Classical philology at the University of Helsinki and baroness Beata Sofia Gyldén. He spent his student years at his father&#x27;s university, graduating as a &quot;filosofie magister&quot; from the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics in 1860. He studied under Lorenz Leonard Lindelof and then went to do a postdoctoral at Gotha under Peter Hansen working on the orbit of Neptune. In 1871 he was called by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to be its astronomer and head of the Stockholm Observatory. From 1872 he was a member of the Academy. In 1885 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The lunar crater &quot;Gyldén&quot; and the minor planet 806 Gyldenia were named in his honor.

<doc id="1208825" wikidata="Q131166" url="?curid=1208825" title="Cryolophosaurus">
<text>Cryolophosaurus ( or ; ) is a genus of large theropod dinosaur known from only a single species Cryolophosaurus ellioti, from the early Jurassic of Antarctica. It was one of the largest theropods of the Early Jurassic, with the subadult being estimated to have reached long and weighed .

&quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was first excavated from Antarctica&#x27;s Early Jurassic, Pliensbachian aged Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, by paleontologist Dr. William Hammer in 1991. It was the first carnivorous dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica and the first non-avian dinosaur from the continent to be officially named. The sediments in which its fossils were found have been dated at ~196 to 188 million years ago, representing the Early Jurassic Period.

&quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; is known from a skull, a femur and other material, all of which have caused its classification to vary greatly. The femur possesses many primitive characteristics that have classified &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; as a dilophosaurid or a neotheropod outside of Dilophosauridae and Averostra, whereas the skull has many advanced features, leading the genus to be considered a tetanuran, an abelisaurid, a ceratosaur and even an allosaurid. &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; is currently considered to be a derived neotheropod, close to Averostra. Additionally, &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; possessed a distinctive &quot;pompadour&quot; crest that spanned the head from side to side. Based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture, it is thought that this bizarre crest was used for intra-species recognition. The brain of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was also more primitive than those of other theropods.

==Discovery and naming==
&quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; originally was collected during the 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils were found in the siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian Stage of the early Jurassic. &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after &quot;Antarctopelta&quot;, but named earlier.

In 1991, both Hammer and the Ohio State University geologist David Elliot excavated separate outcrops near Beardmore Glacier, sharing logistical expenses. Elliot&#x27;s team first came across the remains of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; in a rock formation around the altitude of high and about from the South Pole. When the discovery was made, they soon notified Hammer. Over the next three weeks, Hammer excavated of fossil-bearing rock. The team recovered over 100 fossil bones, including those of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;. The specimens were formally named and described in 1994 by Hammer and Hickerson, in the journal &quot;Science&quot;.

During the 2003 season, a field team returned and collected more material from the original site. A second locality was discovered about higher in the section on Mt. Kirkpatrick.

The name &quot;Cryolophosaurus ellioti&quot; is derived from the Greek words κρυος (meaning &#x27;cold&#x27; or &#x27;frozen&#x27;, in reference to its discovery in Antarctica), λοφος (meaning &#x27;crest&#x27;) and (meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;), thus &quot;cold crest lizard&quot;. Hammer and Hickerson named the species &quot;C. ellioti&quot;, after David Elliot, who had made the initial discovery of the fossils.

==Description==

&quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was a large, well-built theropod, one of the largest of its time. The holotype specimen is estimated to have reached long and weighed . In 2016 Molina-Pérez and Larramendi gave a larger estimation of 7.7 meters (25.3 ft) and 780 kg (1,720 lb). Some researchers noted that the holotype individual probably represents a sub-adult, so adults could have been larger. Despite having slender proportions, &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; is one of the largest known Early Jurassic theropods.

The holotype FMNH PR1821 is the only fully described specimen of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;. The specimen consists of an incomplete skull and mandibles lacking most of their front half; nine maxillary teeth; a fragmentary sixth cervical centrum; cervical vertebrae 7–10; several posterior cervical ribs; several anterior dorsal vertebrae; most mid and posterior dorsal vertebrae; several dorsal ribs; the fifth sacral vertebrae; three chevrons; many partial and complete caudal vertebrae and centra; two partial humeri; a proximal radius; a proximal ulna; a partial ilium; a proximal pubis; both ischia, but only one distal; two incomplete femora; the distal end of a tibia; the distal end of a fibula, and the astragalus and calcaneum. In 2013, new material of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was unearthed in Antarctica. The description of this material has not yet been published in a non-abstract form.

===Skull===

The holotype of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; consists of a high, narrow skull, which was discovered articulated with the rest of the skeleton. The skull is an estimated long. It has a peculiar nasal crest that runs just over the eyes, where it rises perpendicular to the skull and fans out. It is thin and highly furrowed, giving it a unique &quot;pompadour&quot; appearance and earned it the nickname &quot;Elvisaurus.&quot; The crest is an extension of the skull bones, near the tear ducts, fused on either side to orbital horns which rise from the eye sockets. While other theropods like the &quot;Monolophosaurus&quot; have crests, they usually run along the skull instead of across it.

An unpublished study conducted by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested that previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The study found that the &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; fossil has a nearly complete, undistorted cranial cavity which is complete enough to give an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; a basal position in Theropoda. Closer examination of how the skull bones fused reviewed details in the snout and forehead that are exceptionally similar to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;.

==Classification==
Classification of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; is difficult because it has a mix of primitive and advanced characteristics. The femur has traits of early theropods, while the skull resembles much later species of the clade Tetanurae, like China&#x27;s &quot;Sinraptor&quot; and &quot;Yangchuanosaurus&quot;. This led Paul Sereno &quot;et al.&quot; (1994) to place &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; in the taxon Allosauridae. Originally, Hammer and colleagues suspected that &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; might be a ceratosaur or even an early abelisaur, with some traits convergent with those of more advanced tetanurans, but ultimately concluded that it was itself the earliest known member of the tetanuran group. While a subsequent study by Hammer (along with Smith and Currie) again recovered &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; as a tetanuran, a later (2007) study by the same authors found that it was more closely related to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dracovenator&quot;. Sterling Nesbitt &quot;et al.&quot; (2009), using the characters of &quot;Tawa&quot; found &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; to be neither a dilophosaurid nor averostran neotheropod but instead the sister group of a clade composed of dilophosaurids and averostrans. However, in 2012, Matthew Carrano found that &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was a tetanuran, related to &quot;Sinosaurus&quot;, but unrelated to &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. In 2020, a monograph of &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; found &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; to be a derived neotheropod, close to Averostra, in a more derived position than &quot;Zupaysaurus&quot;, but less than &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;.

The following cladogram illustrates a synthesis of the relationships of the early theropod groups compiled by Hendrickx &quot;et al.&quot; in 2015.

However, a 2020 study conducted by Adam Marsh and Timothy Rowe found Cryolophosaurus to be a basal Neotheropod. While it was still closer to Averostra than Coelophysoidea was, it was still more basal than Dilophosaurus.

==Paleobiology==
===Cranial ornamentation===

Cranial display features, such as the one possessed by &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are available to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian &quot;et al.&quot; noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures can be explained by the phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating. In 2019, a species recognition function was disputed but a socio-sexual display structure model was suggested.

===Diet===

When the type specimen was discovered, several long cervical ribs, of a supposed prosauropod dinosaur were found in the mouth of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;, which led Hammer (1998) to conclude that it was feeding on the prosauropod when it died. Hammer further noted that since the ribs were found extending all the way back to the theropod&#x27;s neck region, this individual may have choked to death on these ribs. However, Smith &quot;et al.&quot; concluded that these remains belonged to the &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; specimen itself, and not to Hammer&#x27;s &quot;prosauropod&quot;. Hammer also concluded that a post-canine tooth belonging to a tritylodont (an early mammal relative), found with the remains, was part of its stomach contents when it died.

===Paleopathology===
Some &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; bones have pathologies that show evidence of scavenging. Broken teeth from a juvenile &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; were found nearby. These teeth have no roots and likely shed naturally while scavenging the adult &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; carcass.

Another possible pathology is found in the astragalus (ankle bone) of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;. This bone was preserved with a small splint from the fibula located just above the ankle. The splint, however, may also be just a unique morphological feature of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;.

==Paleoenvironment==

All known specimens of &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; have been recovered in the Hanson Formation, which is one of only two major dinosaur-bearing rock formations found on the continent of Antarctica. &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; was found about from the South Pole but, at the time it lived, this was about or so farther north. The Hanson Formation accumulated in a rift environment located between c. 60 and 70S, fringing the East Antarctic Craton behind the active Panthalassan margin of southern Gondwana, being dominated by two types of facies: &quot;tuffaceous&quot; siltstone of fluvial and volcanic strata, deposited maybe more than 10 million years based on the thickness. In the Early Jurassic, Antarctica was closer to the equator and the world was considerably warmer than today, but the climate was still cool temperate similar to that of modern southern Chile, and humid, with a temperature interval of 17–18 degrees. Models of Jurassic air flow indicate that coastal areas probably never dropped much below freezing, although more extreme conditions existed inland.

This formation has produced the remains of two smaller theropods, the sauropodomorph &quot;Glacialisaurus&quot;, a crow-sized pterosaur (a dimorphodontid), a tritylodont, herbivorous synapsid, and two small unnamed sauropodomorphs. Beyond vertebrates, Insects (Blattodea, Coleoptera), Ostracodans, Conchostracans and arthropod ichnofossils (&quot;Diplichnites, Planolites, Scoyenia&quot;) are know from other coeval localities, like Gair Mesa, Mount Carson or Shafer Peak. Plant remains are also very common, from large tree trunks (+50 cm) at Mount Carson to Palynomorphs at Shafer Peak. Macrofoliar and cuticle remains have also been recovered from several localities, including Conifers (Araucariaceae, Cheirolepidiaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae or Voltziales), Cycadophytes (Bennettitales), Pteridosperms (Corystospermaceae), Ferns (Dipteridaceae, Matoniaceae, Osmundaceae and Polypodiales), Equisetaceae, Isoetaceae and Liverworts (Marchantiales). Some of the plant remains are relictual genera, like the youngest record of Dicroidium. Common presence of the invertebrate ichnogenus &quot;Planolites&quot; indicates the local fluvial, alluvial or lacustrine waters where likely continuous all year, as well the presence of abundant &quot;Otozamites&quot; trends to suggest high humidity. Overall points to a setting with strong seasonality in day-length given the high latitude, perhaps similar to warm-temperate, frost-free forest and open woodland as in North Island of New Zealand. Despite the proper conditions, peat accumulation was rare, mostly due to the influence of local volcanism, with common wildfire activity as shown by charred coalified plant remains.

<text>George Stringer VC (24 July 1889 – 22 November 1957) from Miles Platting, Manchester was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Upon leaving school, Stringer worked for a local cloth dyer and bleacher. In 1905, he joined the Lancashire Fusilier Volunteers, a militia unit, and just before the outbreak of World War I he joined a territorial unit of the Manchester Regiment, then went on active duty with the 1st Battalion.

==Military career==

His unit fought in France until December 1915, then was posted to Mesopotamia in January 1916. He was awarded the VC for heroic actions during the Battle of Es Sinn on 8 March 1916. During the effort to relieve the besieged garrison of British and Indian Army troops at Kut-el-Amara.

His citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; read:
Stringer was subsequently Mentioned in Despatches and also awarded the Gold Medal for Bravery by the Kingdom of Serbia. He was later wounded, developed enteric fever and jaundice, and was returned to the UK in June 1917.

As a result of his wounds, Stringer was given a disability pension and a job as a doorkeeper with the Manchester Assistance Board which he kept until he retired aged 62, with time out during World War II for a stint as a munitions worker. He died six years later in the town of Oldham and was buried in Philips Park Cemetery, close to William Jones VC.

Stringer&#x27;s medals are in the collection of the Museum of The Manchester Regiment, Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.

<doc id="1208835" wikidata="Q6823521" url="?curid=1208835" title="Metes and bounds">
<text>Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land, real property (in contrast to personal property) or real estate. The system has been used in England for many centuries and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries. The system is also used in the Canadian province of Ontario, and throughout Canada for the description of electoral districts. By custom, it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law, including Zimbabwe, South Africa, India and Bangladesh. While still in hand-me-down use, this system has been largely overtaken in the past few centuries by newer systems such as rectangular (government survey) and lot and block (recorded plat).

Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography, along with directions and distances, to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land. The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a point of beginning, returning to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds. It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys. At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments. 

* Metes refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction. A direction may be a simple compass bearing or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods.
* Bounds (Abuttals and boundaries) refer to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public road way, or an existing building. The system is often used to define larger pieces of property (e.g. farms) and political subdivisions (e.g. town boundaries) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive, or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description.

== Usage ==
A typical description for a small parcel of land would be: &quot;Commencing at a corner at the intersection of two stone walls near an apple tree on the north side of Muddy Creek road one mile above the junction of Muddy and Indian Creeks, thence north for 150 rods to the end of the stone wall bordering the road, thence northwest along a line to a large standing rock on the corner of the property now or formerly belonging to John Smith, thence west 150 rods to the corner of a barn near a large oak tree, thence south to Muddy Creek road, thence down the side of the creek road to the point of commencement.&quot; The sequence begins with an identified corner serving as benchmark. The description then gives distance, direction and various boundary descriptions as if one were walking the bounds pacing off the distance to the next corner where there is a change of direction. Where watercourses form part of the bounds their meander is generally taken as a straight line between the established corners and their monuments.

In many deeds, the direction is described not by azimuth (a clockwise degree measure out of 360 degrees) but instead by bearing (a direction north or south followed by a degree measure out of 90 degrees and another direction west or east). For example, such a bearing might be listed as &quot;N 42°35&#x27; W&quot;, which means that the bearing is 42°35&#x27; counterclockwise, or west of north. This has the advantage of providing the same degree measure regardless of which direction a particular boundary is being followed; the boundary can be traversed in the opposite direction simply by exchanging N for S and E for W. In other words, &quot;N 42°35&#x27; W&quot; describes the same boundary as &quot;S 42°35&#x27; E&quot; but is traversed in the opposite direction.

In most distance measures, especially those in older deeds and where measuring distances over a furlong, boundary lengths are listed in rods or poles instead of feet or meters. Rods and poles are equivalent measures equaling 16.5 feet. There are four rods in one chain. English surveyors carried chains (such as a Gunter&#x27;s chain) with which to measure lengths, as well as poles, and many older legal descriptions of real estate in the United States are given in chains and poles.

== Resolving inconsistencies ==
Some courts have established a list of priorities to resolve inconsistent descriptions of corners. In descending order starting with the most reliable: (1) natural monuments, (2) artificial monuments such as roads and marked or surveyed lines, (3) adjacent tracts or boundaries, (4) courses or directions, (5) distances, and (6) area or quantity.

== Difficulties ==
Once such a survey is in place, the corners may have to depend on tradition and long use to establish the line along the boundaries between them. In some areas where land was deeded before 1593, the lengths given predate the changes to the length of the furlong and mile by Queen Elizabeth I. In other places references to the official borders of towns, counties, and states may have changed. Compass directions always have to be tied to a table of annual deflections because magnetic north is constantly changing. The description might refer to &quot;landmarks&quot; such as the &quot;large oak tree&quot; which could disappear; or be confused with a different tree that had grown later. Streams might dry up, meander or change course. Man-made features such as roads, walls, markers or stakes used to mark corners and determine the line of the boundaries between corners may have been moved. As these features move, change and disappear over time, when it comes time to re-establish the corners along the line of these boundaries (for sale, subdivision, or building construction) it can become difficult, even impossible, to determine the original location of the corner. In the metes and bounds system, corners, distance, direction, monuments and bounds are always carried back to the original intent regardless of where they are now. Court cases are sometimes required to settle the matter when it is suspected the corner markers may have been moved.

These kinds of problems caused the United States to largely replace this system except in the east. Beginning with the Land Ordinance of 1785, it began a transition to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) used in the central and western states. The eastern, or original states, continue to use the metes and bounds surveys of their founders.

==History of use in the United States ==
This system was imported to the original colonies that formed the United States. It is also used in some states that were previously part of one of the Thirteen Colonies, or where land was allocated before 1785. These include West Virginia, Kentucky, Maine, Tennessee and Vermont. Because Texas was an independent republic prior to statehood, its land system is primarily metes and bounds.

Election constituency boundaries continue to be described by the use of metes and bounds, even in jurisdictions where land plats are not otherwise based upon metes and bounds. Such mapping generally uses streets and their intersections to define the boundaries of election districts, wards, precincts, &quot;inter alia&quot;. &quot;E.g.&quot;: &quot;From the intersection of Main Street and John Doe Boulevard, thence north to ABC Drive, thence generally east along the median of ABC Drive to 123rd Street, thence...&quot;

==Use in Canada==
In Canada, metes and bounds are frequently used to officially define the territory of electoral districts, particularly in urban areas where the districts may subdivide municipalities or otherwise not conform to municipal boundaries. For example, the definition for the federal electoral district of Ottawa Centre in the 2012 representation order reads (in part):

Consisting of that part of the City of Ottawa described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the interprovincial boundary between Ontario and Quebec with a line running 45°00&#x27;W from the mouth of the Rideau Canal; thence S45°00&#x27;E along said line to the mouth of the Rideau Canal; thence generally southeasterly along said canal to the northeasterly production of Frank Street; thence northeasterly along said production to the intersection of Greenfield Avenue with Nicholas Street; thence southeasterly along Nicholas Street to Highway No. 417; thence easterly along said highway to the Rideau River; thence generally southerly along said river to the easterly production of Borden Side Road; thence westerly along said production to Prince of Wales Drive; [...]

The difficulty with permanency of features on the ground does not arise because the electoral districts are redistributed every ten years, allowing districts to be brought into conformity with any features that have changed in the intervening time.

<text>Archidamus III (died 338 BC) ( ) was the son of Agesilaus II and king of Sparta from 360 to 338 BC.

==Biography==
While still a prince, he was the eispnelas (, inspirer, or pederastic lover) of Cleonymus, son of Sphodrias. He interceded with his own father to spare his aites&#x27;s (, lover) father&#x27;s life in a legal matter, an action which further intensified friction between Athens and Sparta. He later led the Spartan forces both before and during his rule. Archidamus headed the force sent to aid the Spartan army after its defeat by the Thebans at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, and was commander later during the fighting in the Peloponnese. Four years later he captured Caryae, ravaged the territory of the Parrhasii and defeated the Arcadians, Argives and Messenians in the &quot;tearless battle&quot;, so called because the victory did not cost the Spartans a single life. However, he was in turn defeated by the Arcadians in 364 BC at Cromnus.

In 362 BC, he showed great courage in the defense of Sparta against the Theban commander Epaminondas. As king, Archidamus supported the Phocians against Thebes in the Sacred War of 355–346. In 346 BC, he went to Crete to help Lyttos in their struggle against Knossos in the Foreign War. In 343 BC, the Spartan colony Tarentum asked for Sparta&#x27;s help in the war against the Italic populations, notably the Lucanians and the Messapians. In 342 BC, Archidamus arrived in Italy with a fleet and a mercenary army and fought against the barbarians, but in 338 BC he was defeated and killed under the walls of the Messapian city of Manduria. He was succeeded by his son Agis III, and was also the father of Eudamidas I and another son named Agesilaus.

<text>Bewl Water is a reservoir in the valley of the River Bewl, straddling the boundary between Kent and East Sussex in England. It is about south of Lamberhurst, Kent. The reservoir was part of a project to increase the supply of water in the area. It supplies Southern Water&#x27;s customers in the towns of Thanet and Hastings.

Work to construct the reservoir began in 1973 with the damming and subsequent flooding of the Bewl River valley. It was completed in 1975, having been filled with over 31,300 million litres of water, with a total project cost of £11 million. It is now the largest body of inland water in Southeast England.

In winter, when the flow in the River Medway exceeds 275 million litres per day, river water is pumped to the reservoir for storage. There is an outlined plan to raise the water level by a further three metres with intentions of increasing the yield by up to 30% to help with the growing water demand in Southeast England. This will, however, put further demands on the River Medway to supply the additional water required, with the potential for environmental degradation in the river and the ecosystems that it supports.

==Leisure use==
Bewl Water Outdoor Centre hosts a variety of outdoor activities on and around the reservoir. These include sailing, windsurfing, rowing, sculling, canoeing, kayaking, trout &amp; predator fishing, and paddleboarding. A floating obstacle course is also available on the reservoir.

Away from the water, numerous walking and cycling routes surround the 12½-mile Round Reservoir Route.

<text>George Veazey Strong (March 14, 1880 – January 10, 1946) was a U.S. Army general with the rank of major general, who is most famous for his service as commander of the Military Intelligence Corps during World War II.

==Early life==

Strong was born on March 14, 1880, in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois. His family later moved to Helena, Montana, where he attended Helena High School. Strong then attended the Michigan Military Academy for two years, graduating in 1900. Subsequently, he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and was a graduate of Class of 1904, in which many of his classmates also later became famous generals, for example: Joseph Stilwell, Lesley J. McNair, Robert C. Richardson, Jr., Jay Leland Benedict, Innis P. Swift, Henry Conger Pratt, Francis Honeycutt, Charles F. Thompson, Fulton Q. Gardner, George R. Allin, William Bryden, Walter R. Fulton, Pelham D. Glassford, Irving J. Phillipson, Donald C. Cubbison or Thomas M. Robins. While at West Point, he was an award-winning fencer. Strong was also a graduate of Northwestern University Law School, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1916.

During World War I, Strong served overseas in France with American Expeditionary Forces. Strong served as lieutenant colonel on the staff of IV Corps of the Second United States Army during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and for his staff service in this assignments, he was awarded with Army Distinguished Service Medal and later with two Purple Hearts.

===Distinguished Service Medal Citation===

The official U.S. Army citation for Strong&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal reads:

:General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 38 (1922)
:Action Date: World War I
:Name: George Veazey Strong
:Service: Army
:Rank: Lieutenant Colonel
:Company: Headquarters
:Division: 2d Army, American Expeditionary Forces
:Citation: &quot;The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Lieutenant Colonel (Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Department) George Veazey Strong, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. While on staff duty with Headquarters, 4th Army Corps and Headquarters, 2d Army, American Expeditionary Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Strong was in charge of all troop movements preparatory to the St. Mihiel attack and immediately following this attack, and was also in charge of all troop movements from the 4th Army Corps in the Toul sector to the Argonne front. By his tireless energy, keen foresight, and sound judgment he perfected the multifarious duties whereby all of these movements were carried to successful completion. During this period his services were conspicuously efficient and contributed materially to the success of these operations.&quot;

==Between wars==
Strong served as a law professor at West Point from 1920 to 1922. He graduated from the United States Army War College in 1924, the advanced course at the United States Army Infantry School in 1929 and the Command and General Staff School in 1931. Strong was promoted to brigadier general on June 1, 1938.

==World War II==

In 1940, Strong was appointed commander of the Seventh Corps Area and promoted to major general on April 3, 1941, serving in this capacity until May 1941, when he was reassigned to the VIII Corps as its commander. He succeeded Walter Krueger, who was promoted and transferred. Strong stayed in this capacity until 1942, where he was succeeded by Major General Daniel Isom Sultan.

Strong was chosen to become U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G-2). Major General Strong served in this capacity until January 1944, when he was succeeded by Major General Clayton Bissell. Subsequently, he was retired, but remained employed by the army and attached to the War Department. Strong finally retired in June 1945 and died the following year at Doctors Hospital in Washington, D.C. at the age of 65. He was buried at the West Point Cemetery on January 15, 1946.

For his service during World War II, he was awarded with Oak Leaf Cluster to his Army Distinguished Service Medal and Legion of Merit.

<doc id="1208842" wikidata="Q284321" url="?curid=1208842" title="Mefenamic acid">
<text>Mefenamic acid is a member of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and is used to treat mild to moderate pain.

Its name derives from its systematic name, dimethylphenylaminobenzoic acid. It was discovered and brought to market by Parke-Davis as Ponstel in the 1960s. It became generic in the 1980s and is available worldwide under many brand names such as &quot;Meftal&quot;.

==Medical uses==
Mefenamic acid is used to treat pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, postoperative pain, acute pain including muscle and back pain, toothache and menstrual pain, as well as being prescribed for menorrhagia. In a 10-year study, mefenamic acid and other oral medicines (tranexamic acid) were as effective as the levonorgestrel intrauterine coil; the same proportion of women had not had surgery for heavy bleeding and had similar improvements in their quality of life.

There is evidence that supports the use of mefenamic acid for perimenstrual migraine headache prophylaxis, with treatment starting two days prior to the onset of flow or one day prior to the expected onset of the headache and continuing for the duration of menstruation.

Mefenamic acid is recommended to be taken with food.

==Contraindications==
Mefenamic acid is contraindicated in people who have shown hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria and asthma to this drug or to other NSAIDs (e.g. aspirin); those with peptic ulcers or chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; those with kidney or liver disease; heart failure; after coronary artery bypass surgery; and during the third trimester of pregnancy.

==Side effects==
Known mild side effects of mefenamic acid include headaches, nervousness, and vomiting. Potentially serious side effects may include diarrhea, gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcers, hematemesis (vomiting blood), skin reactions (rashes, itching, swelling; in rare cases toxic epidermal necrolysis) and rarely blood cell disorders such as agranulocytosis. It has been associated with acute liver damage.

In 2008 the US label was updated with a warning concerning a risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in pregnancy.

In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

In its November 2023 monthly drug safety alert under the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI), the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission flagged a risk of DRESS Syndrome due to use of mefenamic acid.

==Overdose==
Symptoms of overdosing include kidney failure, gastrointestinal problems, bleeding, rashes, confusion, hallucinations, vertigo, seizures, and loss of consciousness. It is treated with induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, bone char, and control of electrolytes and vital functions.

== Interactions ==

Interactions are broadly similar to those of other NSAIDs. Mefenamic acid interferes with the anti–blood clotting mechanism of Aspirin. It increases the blood thinning effects of warfarin and phenprocoumon because it displaces them from their plasma protein binding and increases their free concentrations in the bloodstream. It adds to the risk of gastrointestinal ulcera associated with corticosteroids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It can increase the risk for adverse effects of methotrexate and lithium by lowering their excretion via the kidneys. It can increase the kidney toxicity of ciclosporin and tacrolimus. Combination with antihypertensive drugs such as ACE inhibitors, sartans and diuretics can decrease their effectiveness as well as increase the risk for kidney toxicity.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

Like other members of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of NSAIDs, it inhibits both isoforms of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). This prevents formation of prostaglandins, which play a role in pain sensitivity, inflammation and fever, but also in hemostasis, kidney function, sustaining of pregnancy, and protection of the gastric mucosa.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Mefenamic acid is rapidly absorbed from the gut and reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to four hours. When in the bloodstream, over 90% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It probably crosses the placenta, and is found in the breast milk in small amounts.

It is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C9 to the only weakly active 3&#x27;-hydroxymethylmefenamic acid. 3&#x27;-carboxymefenamic acid has also been identified as a metabolite, as well as carboxy glucuronides of all three substances. Mefenamic acid and its metabolites are excreted via the urine (52–67%) and the faeces (20–25%, or less than 20% following another source). The parent substance has a biological half-life of two hours; the half-life of its metabolites may be longer.

==History==
Scientists led by Claude Winder from Parke-Davis invented mefenamic acid in 1961, along with fellow members of the class of anthranilic acid derivatives, flufenamic acid in 1963 and meclofenamate sodium in 1964. U.S. Patent 3,138,636 on the drug was issued in 1964.

It was approved in the UK in 1963 as &quot;Ponstan&quot;, in West Germany in 1964 as &quot;Ponalar&quot; and in France as &quot;Ponstyl&quot;, and the US in 1967 as &quot;Ponstel&quot;.

==Chemistry==
===Synthesis===
Analogous to fenamic acid, this compound may be made from 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 2,3-dimethylaniline.

=== Conformational flexibility ===
Mefenamic acid, a member of the fenamate, is a chemical compound derived from anthranilic acid . This derivative is created by substituting one of the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen atom with a 2,3-dimethylphenyl fragment. The result is a structurally complex molecule with fascinating conformational properties.

The mefenamic acid molecule exhibits conformational lability, meaning it can exist in various shapes or conformers. This flexibility arises from changes in the position of the carboxylic acid group and the 2,3-dimethylphenyl fragment about the anthranil moiety. Specifically, the arrangement of the substituted benzene fragments relative to each other plays a crucial role in determining the different polymorphic forms of mefenamic acid.

Recent experimental studies have unveiled two additional hidden conformers of mefenamic acid. These conformers result from alterations in the positions of hydroxyl groups within the molecule. This discovery adds to our understanding of the compound&#x27;s structural diversity.

External factors, including temperature, pressure, and the surrounding medium, highly influence the conformational state of mefenamic acid. Researchers have conducted extensive investigations into its spatial structure not only in organic solvents but also in supercritical fluids, aerogels, and lipid bilayers. These studies have helped elucidate the impact of different environments on the molecule&#x27;s conformation.

==Society and culture==
===Availability and pricing===
Mefenamic acid is generic and is available worldwide under many brand names.

In the US, wholesale price of a week&#x27;s supply of generic mefenamic acid has been quoted as $426.90 in 2014. Brand-name Ponstel is $571.70. By contrast, in the UK, a weeks supply is £1.66, or £8.17 for branded Ponstan. In New Zealand, a weeks&#x27;s supply of Ponstan costs NZ$9.08, around US$5.50. 

==Research==
While studies have been conducted to see if mefenamic acid can improve behavior in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease there is little evidence that mefenamic acid or other NSAIDs can treat or prevent Alzheimer&#x27;s in humans; clinical trials of NSAIDs other than mefenamic acid for treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s have found more harm than benefit. A small controlled study of 28 human subjects showed improved cognitive impairment using mefenamic acid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy.

<doc id="1208843" wikidata="Q4072842" url="?curid=1208843" title="An African in Greenland">
<text>An African in Greenland is a 1981 book by the Togolese author Tété-Michel Kpomassie.

==Overview==
The book details Kpomassie&#x27;s upbringing in Togo, his encounter as a teen with a book about Greenland and his determination to move there and become a hunter. As A. Alvarez, in his introduction, writes: &quot;Kpomassie&#x27;s book is the ultimate exotic mix—an adventure story that begins in Togo, a narrow strip of a country, formerly a French colony, sandwiched between Benin and Ghana, and ends in Upernavik, way north of the Arctic Circle, on the west coast of Greenland.&quot; After ten years, working his way across Africa and Europe, he finally arrives on the Arctic island. The book recounts all the many episodes one expects from adventure literature: trouble at home, imagining a better life elsewhere, the struggle to find that life, disillusionment with certain hard facts that rub against bookish fancies, and the return, a state of mind where the author is more mature and more in touch with reality. Again, as Alvarez points out, the story reads like a fairy tale.

Readers discover the meaning of the Togolese bokonon, priest of the sacred python, uncharacteristic forms of French hospitality, German housekeeping, Danish dishwashing, and, most of all, the unusual sense of freedom and casualness of the Inuit. His encounter with the native Kalaallit population, which is very different but in many ways very similar in its lifestyle to the tribal society of Togo, forms the core of this book.

Kpomassie did an interview for the BBC, in which he describes his encounters.

==Adaptation==
The book was adapted by Rex Obano for BBC Radio 4 in 2023, with Danny Sapani as Kpomassie.

<doc id="1208849" wikidata="Q2792991" url="?curid=1208849" title="Fourth branch of government">
<text>In politics of the United States, &quot;fourth branch of government&quot; is an unofficial term referring to groups or institutions perceived variously as influencing or acting in the stead of the three branches of the US federal government defined in the Constitution of the United States (legislative, executive and judicial). Views as to whether the influence is due or undue or the actions are for good or ill also vary.

Such groups can include the press (akin to the European &#x27;Fourth Estate&#x27;), the people (in sum or as grand juries), and interest groups. The independent administrative agencies of the United States government, while technically part of any one of the three branches, may also be referred to as a ‘fourth branch’.

== The press ==
While the term ‘fourth estate’ is used to emphasize the independence of &#x27;the press&#x27;, the &quot;fourth branch&quot; suggests that the press is not independent of the government. The concept of the news media or press as a fourth branch stems from a belief that the media&#x27;s responsibility to inform the populace is essential to the healthy functioning of democracy.

Douglass Cater, in his 1959 &quot;The Fourth Branch of Government&quot; offered the hypothesis that the press had become &quot;a &quot;de facto&quot;, quasiofficial &quot;fourth branch of government&quot;&quot; and observed it was the looseness of the American political framework that allowed news media to “insert themselves as another branch of the government”. Cater was &quot;convinced that, insofar as the press did act as a true political player (rather than an unbiased observer of politics), it corrupted itself and went astray from its primary responsibility—to convey important information and to act as a nonpartisan watchdog for the public against all trespassers on their rights.&quot;

In 1985, Walter Annenberg noted that several commentators were applying the term &#x27;fourth branch of government&#x27; to the press to indicate that it has at least as much if not more power to direct public policy than do the other three branches, in part because of its direct contact with the public and its protection &quot;by the First Amendment from responsibility for what they report&quot;.

== The people ==
Justice Antonin Scalia&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;United States v. Williams&quot;, 1992 has been relied on to refer to grand juries as a fourth branch of government. In that opinion, Scalia wrote:
[T]he grand jury is mentioned in the Bill of Rights, but not in the body of the Constitution. It has not been textually assigned, therefore, to any of the branches described in the first three Articles. It &#x27;is a constitutional fixture in its own right&#x27; [case cites]. In fact the whole theory of its function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the Government and the people.

Some have used this to call for common law grand juries &quot;to expose fraud and corruption whether it is in the judicial or political realm.&quot;

Others have used the term in calls to, e.g, &quot;empower the people&quot; by petition or referendum processes or, similarly, for &quot;broader and more direct participation in our governance&quot; by eliminating the Electoral College, implementing e-voting and other measures.

== Interest groups ==
In an article titled &quot;The &#x27;Fourth Branch&#x27; of Government&quot;, Alex Knott of the Center for Public Integrity asserted in 2005 that &quot;special interests and the lobbyists they employ have reported spending, since 1998, a total of almost $13 billion to influence Congress, the White House and more than 200 federal agencies.&quot;

== Administrative agencies ==
The administrative agencies that are funded from public money may exercise powers granted by Congress. Without appropriate controls and oversight this practice may result in a bureaucracy (in the original literal sense). Some critics have argued that a central paradox at the heart of the American political system is democracy&#x27;s reliance on what the critics view as undemocratic bureaucratic institutions that characterize the administrative agencies of government.

An argument made for calling administrative agencies a &quot;fourth branch&quot; of government is the fact that such agencies typically exercise all three constitutionally divided powers within a single bureaucratic body: That is, agencies legislate (a power vested solely in the legislature by the Constitution) through delegated rulemaking authority; investigate, execute, and enforce such rules (via the executive power these agencies are typically organized under); and apply, interpret, and enforce compliance with such rules (a power separately vested in the judicial branch). Additionally, non-executive, or &quot;independent&quot; administrative agencies are often called a fourth branch of government, as they create rules with the effect of law, yet may be composed at least partially of private, non-governmental actors.

The intelligence agencies have also been referred to as the fourth branch of government by people such as House of Representatives member Ron Dellums, Lloyd Gardner and Tom Engelhardt.

==Closely related concepts==
Bob Jessop, in his book, &#x27;The State: Past, Present, Future’ notes the similarity of three constructs:
#’&quot;Deep state&quot;’ — for which he cites Mike Lofgren’s 2014 definition: &quot;a hybrid association of elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern … without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process …”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lofgren_2/21/2014&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
#’&quot;Dark state&quot;’ — “networks of officials, private firms, media outlets, think tanks, foundations, NGOs, interest groups, and other forces that attend to the needs of capital, not of everyday life” while “concealed from public gaze (or ‘hidden in plain sight’)&quot;, citing Jason Lindsay (2013).
#’&quot;The Fourth Branch&quot;’ of US government — consisting of “an ever more unchecked and unaccountable centre …, working behind a veil of secrecy”, citing Tom Engelhardt (2014).

Per Engelhardt: “Classically, … the three branches of government … were to check and balance one another so that power would never become centralized …. The founding fathers [never envisioned] that a &quot;fourth branch of government&quot;, the national security state, would arise, dedicated to the centralization of power in an atmosphere of total secrecy. In the post-9/11 years, it has significantly absorbed the other three branches.”

==In popular culture==
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot; (originally aired October 9, 1994), Springfield&#x27;s leading conservative talk radio host, Birch Barlow (a parody of leading American conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh) welcomes listeners to his show by introducing himself as the &quot;fourth branch of government&quot; and the &quot;51st state.&quot;
* In 2007, the short-lived ABC drama-thriller &quot;Traveler&quot;, the fourth branch existed as a secret society created by the Founding Fathers and composed of the oldest families in the United States, whose purpose is to implement checks and balances on the U.S. government to guide the true course of America.
* Rapper and political activist Immortal Technique has a track entitled the &quot;4th branch,&quot; in which he applies the role of said branch to the media in a pejorative manner. He implies in this track (or pretty much explicitly states) that corporately owned mass-media outlets of the United States act more like another part of the government instead of as independent entities, and he gives some of his reasons for this belief on the track.

<text>Yichang (), alternatively romanized as Ichang, is a prefecture-level city located in western Hubei province, China. Yichang had a population of 3.92 million people at the 2022 census, making it the third most populous city in Hubei. The city is famous for the Three Gorges, the Three Gorges Dam and the Gezhouba Dam, all three of which are located in Yiling District, one of the city&#x27;s districts.

==History==
In ancient times Yichang was known as Yiling. In 278 BC, during the Warring States period, the Qin general Bai Qi set fire to Yiling. In 222 AD, Yichang was also the site of the Battle of Yiling during the Three Kingdoms Period.

Under the Qing Guangxu Emperor, Yichang was opened to foreign commerce as a trading port after the Qing and Great Britain agreed to the Chefoo Convention, which was signed by Sir Thomas Wade and Li Hongzhang in Chefoo on 21 August 1876. The imperial government set up a navigation company there and began building facilities. Since 1949, more than 50 wharves, with a total combined length of over , have been constructed at the port.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Yichang was a primary supply depot for the defending Chinese army. In October 1938, as the Japanese moved up the Yangtze River towards the strategic city of Chongqing, it became clear that Yichang needed to be evacuated. In 40 days, under the direction of businessman Lu Zuofu, more than 100,000 tons of equipment and 30,000 personnel were transported upstream by steamship or by porters pulling smaller vessels through the Three Gorges rapids to Chongqing.

In 1940, the Battle of Zaoyang-Yichang took place in the area.

==Administrative divisions==
Administratively, it is a prefecture-level city; its municipal government has jurisdiction over five counties, five urban districts, and three satellite county-level cities (Yidu, Dangyang, Zhijiang).

===Administrative map===
The prefecture-level city of Yichang has direct jurisdiction over 14 divisions: 5 districts (), 3 county-level cities (), 3 counties (), and 2 autonomous counties ().

==Geography==
Like most prefecture-level cities, Yichang includes both an urban area (which is labeled on less detailed maps as &quot;Yichang&quot;) and the surrounding country area. It covers in Western Hubei Province, on both sides of the Yangtze River. The Xiling Gorge, the easternmost of the Three Gorges on the Yangtze, is located within the prefecture-level city.

Within the prefecture-level city of Yichang, the Yangtze is joined by a number of tributaries, including the Qing River (right), Xiang Xi and Huangbo Rivers (left).

The central urban area of Yichang is split between several districts. On the north bank of the Yangtze, there are Xiling District (the central part of the city), Yiling District, and Wujiagang District, and Xiaoting District. The urban area on the opposite (south) bank of the river is Dianjun District. All these districts, except the central Xiling District, also include a fair amount of suburban/rural area outside of the urban zone.

===Climate===
Yichang has a four-season, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), with cool, damp and generally overcast winters, and hot, humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . Close to 70% of the annual precipitation of occurs from May to September.

==Transport==

===Air===
Yichang Sanxia International Airport is located in the Xiaoting District of Yichang City, which is away from the city center and from the Three Gorges Dam site. The airport is conveniently located, which borders Yihuang Highway in the north, Long River Golden Waterway in the south and Jiaozhi Railway in the east.

===Roads and bridges===
* China National Highway 318 runs east–west through most of the prefecture-level city, south of the center city
* China National Highway 209 passes through the northwestern corner of the prefecture-level city (Xingshan County)
Several provincial highways connect Yichang center city with most counties.

Several bridges span the Yangtze River within the prefecture-level city of Yichang, including (upstream to downstream):
* Xiling Bridge, connecting Letianxi and Sandouping in Yiling District, a few km downstream from the Three Gorges Dam.
* Yiling Bridge, downtown Yichang (a few km downstream from the Gezhouba Dam). It connects the urban Xiling and Dianjun Districts.
* Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge, on the Hu-Rong Expressway, downstream of Yichang center city
* Yiwan Bridge: A Railway Bridge for Yiwan Railway which connects Yichang to Chongqing by high speed trains, almost downstream from the Yiling Bridge.

There are several ferry crossings as well.

===Waterways===
Yichang has long been a major transit port and distribution center of goods, and serves as the economic hub of western Hubei province and an intermediary between the major cities of Chongqing and Wuhan. Its primary industries are shipping and shipbuilding, taking advantage of its location on the Yangtze River. The Qing River in the southern part of the prefectures, with its cascade of dams, is an important waterway. Maoping Town (the county seat of Zigui County), has an active passenger wharf as well.

===Railway===
Yichang is served by several railway lines.

Yichang Railway Station, located in downtown Yichang, opened in 1971, was the city&#x27;s first railway station. In 2012 it closed for a renovation project.

The Yichang East Railway Station, opened in the late 2010 in the eastern suburbs of Yichang, is presently the city&#x27;s main train station. It is the junction point of two segments of the Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, one of China&#x27;s new east–west rail mainlines. To the east, the Hanyi Railway (opened June 29, 2012) provides frequent service to Wuhan, with some trains continuing to Nanjing and Shanghai. To the west, the Yiwan Railway (Yichang-Wanzhou; opened December 2010) serves as the gateway to Hubei&#x27;s southwestern panhandle (Enshi), with some service continuing to Chongqing and Chengdu.

The Jiaozuo–Liuzhou Railway, a north–south line, crosses the eastern part of the prefecture-level city. It crosses the Yangtze at Zhicheng in Yidu County-level City.
==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, its population was 4,017,607 inhabitants of whom 1,536,012 lived in the built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area consisting of Yiling, Xiling, Wujiagang and Dianjun urban districts. The Xiaoting District has not yet been urbanized. Yichang prefecture-level city, is home to many members of the Tujia ethnic group, who mostly live in several counties in the south-west of the prefecture.

Yichang also formed the border between the cultures of Ba in the west (an ancient state in the eastern part of what is now Sichuan Province) and the Chu State in the east (an ancient state in what is now Hubei Province and northern Hunan Province).

==Education==

Since 2002, Yichang City has been home of the China Three Gorges University (the result of the merger of the University of Hydraulic &amp; Electric Engineering, Yichang and of Hubei Sanxia University), the largest comprehensive university in Hubei Province outside Wuhan, with over 20,400 full-time students.

*China Three Gorges University

Additionally, Yichang possesses abundant mineral resources including phosphorus, iron, coal, manganese, vanadium, gold, copper, lead, zinc, silicon, gypsum, graphite, quartz sand, limestone, marble, and barite. Its main agricultural resources are citrus, tea, and aquatic products. Hydropower is the most important and renowned resource, as the world’s largest hydroelectric power station, Three Gorges Dam, generates 111.80 billion kWh per year.

=== Agriculture ===
Located at the transition zone from the western Hubei mountains to the Jianghan Plains, Yichang’s geography features a mild climate, distinct seasons, and abundant rainfall. The main agricultural products in the Yichang region are citrus and tea because of the geography and climate. Due to the increase in urbanization levels and average income levels, along with a more developed supply chain and export market, there has been an expansion of the customer base for these products. Consequently, demand for high-value products such as premium citrus and tea is rapidly growing. In addition, Southeast Asia, the United States, and the Middle East are the main overseas markets of Yichang’s citrus. In 2022, citrus was sold for 6,700 yuan ($960) per ton for exports. The total output of tea in Yichang was 119,200 tons in 2023, and the agricultural production value reached 5.984 billion yuan. From 2000 to 2022, the annual growth rate of citrus fruit production was 10.2%, and for tea was 12.8%.

=== Tourism ===
Yichang has rich tourism resources, which attract millions of visitors for its natural scenery located among mountains and rivers. In 2023, Yichang welcomed about 79 million visitors. The most famous attractions include the Three Gorges Dam Tourist Area, Tribe of the Three Gorges, Qingjiang Gallery, Memorial Temple of Qu Yuan, Three Gorges Grand Waterfalls, and Xiling Gorge. The overall revenue from tourism was 110 billion yuan in 2023, which increased 44.5% from last year.

===Hydropower===

Yichang&#x27;s prefectures have many major hydroelectricity projects. The best known are the two huge dams on the Yangtze River: the Gezhouba Dam (located just upstream of Yichang central city) and Three Gorges Dam, which is upstream. The Geheyan Dam and Gaobazhou Dam on the Qing River are important as well. Besides those, a huge number of medium-sized and small power plants operate on smaller rivers and streams within some prefectures.

<doc id="1208861" wikidata="Q726772" url="?curid=1208861" title="Ottobah Cugoano">
<text>Ottobah Cugoano ( – ), also known as John Stuart, was a British abolitionist and activist who was born in West Africa. Born into a Fante family in Ajumako, he was sold into slavery at the age of thirteen and shipped to Grenada in the West Indies. In 1772, he was purchased by a merchant who took him to England, where Cugoano learned to read and write, and was emancipated. Eventually, he started working for the artists Richard and Maria Cosway, becoming acquainted with several promiment British political and cultural figures as a result. He joined the Sons of Africa, a group of Black abolitionists in Britain, and died at some point after 1791. 

==Early life==
He was born Quobna Ottobah Cugoano in 1757 in Agimaque (Ajumako) in the Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana). He was born into a Fante family and his family was close to the local chief.

At the age of 13, Cugoano was kidnapped with a group of children, sold into slavery and transported from Cape Coast on a slave ship to Grenada. He worked on a plantation in the Lesser Antilles until he was purchased in 1772 by Alexander Campbell, a Scottish plantation owner, who took him into his household. Late in 1772, Campbell took him with him on a visit to England where Cugoano was able to secure his freedom. On 20 August 1773, he was baptised at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, as &quot;John Stuart – a Black, aged 16 Years&quot;.

==Abolitionist==
In 1784, Cugoano was employed as a servant by the artists Richard Cosway and his wife, Maria. Through the Cosways, he came to the attention of leading British political and cultural figures of the time, including the poet William Blake and the Prince of Wales. Together with Olaudah Equiano and other educated Africans living in Britain, Cugoano became active in the Sons of Africa, an abolitionist group whose members wrote frequently to the newspapers of the day, condemning the practice of slavery.
In 1786, he played a key role in the case of Henry Demane, a kidnapped black man who was to be shipped back to the West Indies. Cugoano contacted Granville Sharp, a well-known abolitionist, who was able to have Demane removed from the ship before it sailed.

In 1787, possibly with the help of his friend Olaudah Equiano, Cugoano published an aboitionist work entitled &quot;Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species&quot; (1787). By now a devout Christian, his work was informed by Cugoano&#x27;s religious belief, and he used arguments around Christianity and global economics and politics for this cause. The work called for the abolition of slavery and immediate emancipation of all enslaved people. It argues that an enslaved person&#x27;s duty is to escape from slavery, and that force should be used to prevent further enslavement. Cugoano devoted pages to his own first-hand experience, describing how he had been betrayed by African slave traders who had sold him and other children to European traders. He vividly recalled his exact worth, being equal to that of a gun, cloth and some lead. The work was immensely popular, being reprinted three times and translated into French.

The work was sent to prominent British political figures such as George III, the Prince of Wales and Edmund Burke. A shorter version of the work was published in 1791, with subscribers including prominent artists such as Cosway, Joshua Reynolds, James Northcote and Joseph Nollekens, &quot;indicating their support of Cugoano&#x27;s mission&quot;. In the shortened work, addressed to the &quot;Sons of Africa&quot;, Cugoano expressed qualified support for the efforts to establish a colony in Sierra Leone for London&#x27;s &quot;Poor Blacks&quot; (mostly freed African-American slaves who had been relocated to London after the American Revolutionary War; other early settlers were the Nova Scotian Settlers, that is Black Loyalists, also former American slaves, from Nova Scotia, who chose to move to Sierra Leone). Cugoano called for the establishment of schools in Britain especially for African students.

In 1791, Cugoano moved with the Cosways to 12 Queen Street in Mayfair. His last known letter, written in 1791, mentions travelling to &quot;upwards of fifty places&quot; to promote the book and that he found that &quot;complexion is a predominant prejudice&quot;. Cugoano wished to travel to Nova Scotia to recruit settlers for the proposed free colony of African Britons in Sierra Leone but it is not known if he did so.

After 1791, Cugoano disappears from the historical record and it is likely that he died in 1791 or 1792.

== Commemoration ==

In November 2020, an English Heritage blue plaque honouring Cugoano was unveiled on Schomberg House in Pall Mall, London, where he had lived and worked with the Cosways from 1784 to 1791.

On 20 August 2023, St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, dedicated a new plaque to honour the 250th anniversary of Cugoano&#x27;s baptism there in 1773, the only recorded date in his life. St James&#x27;s additionally commissioned Trinidad-based artist Che Lovelace to create a new artwork in commemoration of Cugoano&#x27;s baptismal anniversary, to be installed in the church entrance on 20 September 2023 – the first permanent artwork commissioned by St James&#x27;s Church, as well as the first anywhere in the world to commemorate Cugoano.

<text>CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V., known as Cemex, is a Mexican multinational building materials company headquartered in San Pedro, near Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. It manufactures and distributes cement, ready-mix concrete and aggregates in more than 50 countries. In 2020 it was ranked as the 5th largest cement company (by amount of cement produced annually) in the world, at 87.09 million tonnes.

Lorenzo Zambrano was the chairman and chief executive officer until his death on May 21, 2014. The Board of Directors named Rogelio Zambrano Lozano as chairman, and Fernando A. Gonzalez as CEO.

About a quarter of the company&#x27;s sales come from its Mexico operations, a third from its plants in the U.S., 30% from its operations in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and the rest from its other plants around the world.
CEMEX currently operates on four continents, with 64 cement plants, 1,348 ready-mix-concrete facilities, 246 quarries, 269 distribution centers and 68 marine terminals.

In the 2021 Forbes Global 2000, Cemex was ranked as the 1178th -largest public company in the world with over US$13 billion in annual sales.

The company&#x27;s world headquarters are in San Pedro Garza García, a city that is part of the Monterrey metropolitan area in the northeastern Mexican state of Nuevo León.
==History==
CEMEX was founded with the opening of Cementos Hidalgo, in 1906. Meanwhile, Cementos Portland Monterrey began operations in 1920, and in 1931, the two companies merged, becoming Cementos Mexicanos, now CEMEX. In the 1960s, CEMEX grew significantly when it acquired several more plants throughout Mexico. In 1976, the company went public on the Mexican stock exchange, and that same year, became the largest cement producer in Mexico with the purchase of three plants from Cementos Guadalajara. In 1982, the company made significant progress in overseas markets, doubling its exports. Further acquisitions of Mexican cement companies were made in 1987 and 1989, making CEMEX one of the ten largest cement companies in the world.

In 2004, CEMEX received the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for their creative and efficient use of information technology.

In 2005, CEMEX acquired RMC Group, a ready mixed concrete, quarrying and concrete products company headquartered in Egham, United Kingdom.

===Internationalization, 1990–2006===
In 1992, CEMEX began its push into the international landscape with the purchase of Spain&#x27;s two largest cement companies, Valenciana de Cementos (Valcem, currently head of CEMEX Spain) and Cementos SANSON. Venezuela&#x27;s largest cement company, VENCEMOS, was acquired by CEMEX in 1994, and plants were purchased the same year in the United States and in Panama. In 1995 CEMEX acquired a cement company in the Dominican Republic, and with the purchase of a majority stake in a Colombian cement company in 1996, CEMEX became the third largest cement company in the world. In 1997–1999, the company expanded its scope to include Asia and Africa, making major purchases in the Philippines, Indonesia and Egypt, as well as Costa Rica. The acquisition of U.S. based Southdown made CEMEX the largest cement company in North America, and further international purchases were made in the following two years—a Thai company in 2001, and in 2002, a Puerto Rican company.

On March 1, 2005, CEMEX completed its $5.8 billion acquisition of the London-based RMC Group, which made CEMEX the worldwide leader in ready-mix concrete production and increased its exposure to European markets. With the acquisition, the company expected its annual cement production to increase to 97 million tons. Also they had hoped to see its annual sales grow to $15 billion, just shy of the market leader, Lafarge , which had sales of $17 billion. As none of these targets was met, CEMEX started looking for another suitor in its M&amp;A push.

On October 27, 2006, CEMEX announced a US$12.8 billion offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Rinker Group, Limited. Seven months later, on April 10, 2007, the Rinker board of directors approved an upgraded offer of USD 14.2 billion, and on June 7, 2007, CEMEX secured the commitment from the holders of more than 50% of the shares to complete the acquisition.

===Recent history (2006–)===
Shortly after the apparent finalization of the Rinker deal in 2007, the United States Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against CEMEX, blocking the acquisition. After a lengthy process, CEMEX complied with regulators by divesting (selling) 40+ cement and concrete plants formerly part of itself or Rinker, essentially devaluing the initial deal.

In April 2008, the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, announced the nationalization of &quot;the whole cement industry&quot; in that country, in response to the belief that the industry was exporting its products in order to receive prices above those it was allowed within the country. In mid-2008 the Venezuelan government took over the Venezuelan operations of CEMEX, the largest Venezuelan producer with around a 50% market share; a deal on compensation was still to be reached in March 2009, despite agreements being reached in mid-2008 with the other two major cement producers. In December 2011, an agreement was reached, with Cemex receiving $600m in compensation, and benefiting from the cancellation of $154m in debt.

After having problems with the Mexican peso devaluation of 2008, including problems with derivatives, CEMEX had to rethink its international standings to decrease debt and avoid a default. In June 2009, CEMEX sold its Australian operations to Holcim for A$ 2.2 billion (US$1.75 billion) helping refinance its US$14 billion debt, which partly was due to the acquisition, two years earlier, of the Rinker Group.

In December 2010, DOL Resolves Employee Back Wage Case With CEMEX – The U.S. Department of Labor announced the filing of a consent judgment in a case against CEMEX Inc. and the recovery of $1,514,449 in overtime back wages for 1,705 current and former ready-mix drivers who worked in eight states.

In 2016, Cemex sold its Rinker Materials pipe business to Quikrete.

In February 2018, the company reported record earnings of $750 million for all of 2016, the highest in a decade. Lowering company debt after recent acquisitions were a main cause of the company&#x27;s financial performance. In the second-quarter 2021 CEMEX reported a net profit of US$270 million and a Debt-to-Ebitda 2.85 leverage ratio, within investment-grade range.

In July 2022, Cemex acquired majority stake in ProStein, a German aggregates producer.

In 2023, the U.S. National Labor Relations Board affirmed findings that Cemex had committed over two dozen unfair labor practices leading up to a 2019 union election. The board used this case to set a new policy that an employer who interferes with an election will be compelled to recognize the union without an election, where previously a new election would be ordered. The case marked a significant new policy which partly revived the Joy Silk doctrine.

==Social responsibility==
CEMEX has developed a number of educational and social responsibility initiatives. For example, it instituted the Premio CEMEX, an annual award that recognizes works in the fields of sustainability, accessibility, construction and architecture. Also, it funds the Catedra Blanca, and honors architecture courses in three universities: the ITESM, in Monterrey, the Universidad Iberoamericana, in Mexico City, and the Barcelona School of Architecture. Also, CEMEX has created the Centro CEMEX-Tecnológico de Monterrey, which is a research and development program for sustainable communities across Mexico thru the Premio CEMEX-TEC.

In 2007, the Organization of American States (OAS), through their Trust for the Americas, awarded the company The Corporate Citizen of the Americas Award 2007, for the social benefits of their program &quot;Patrimonio Hoy&quot;, in Mexico, that according to José Miguel Insulza, President of the OAS, has a positive effect in low-income families. This initiative, conceived in 1998, aims to reduce the Mexican housing deficit, which leaves more than 20 million people with inadequate shelter. Patrimonio Hoy organizes low-income families into self-financing cells that facilitate and expedite the typical homebuilding process. CEMEX and its network provide the products needed but also the technical assistance, including an architect who helps design homes to optimize space and reduce waste. To date, more than 150,000 Mexican families have realized their dreams of home ownership 

As of 2020, CEMEX Social Responsibility initiatives had benefited over 23 million people in its neighboring communities world-wide. The company also restated its Social Impact policy, with the goal of benefiting 30 million people by 2030. Fortune Magazine ranked CEMEX in 39th place in its 2020 Change the World Index.

==Environmental record==
CEMEX has been accused of violating environmental laws in the United States. Environmental watchdog groups and the United States Environmental Protection Agency are threatening to file suit claiming the company has committed numerous violations of the Clean Air Act in Lyons, Colorado. CEMEX divested its operation in Lyons, Colorado, in 2016. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has also filed suit against CEMEX in Victorville, California, claiming the company failed to install modern air pollution controls, despite spending millions in renovations. The case was settled in 2009. In February 2021 the U.S. Department of Energy awarded funding for research on carbon-capture at the CEMEX Victorville cement plant.

In the United Kingdom, CEMEX was originally fined £400,000 in October 2006 after hazardous dust was deposited up to three miles (5 km) away from its Rugby works. The fine was the highest ever given under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regulations, and was also the highest for an Environment Agency prosecution for six years. The fine was, however, judged excessive by the Court of Appeal and so reduced to £50,000. In April 2007, CEMEX announced that it had installed a £6.5 million dust abatement system at the same works in Rugby, which had cut particulate emissions by 80%. The site comes under the auspices of the EU Waste Incineration Directive as it burns waste tires for fuel. There are concerns over the impact on both the environment and human health from this practice, although it is common practice in many cement works. In 2021 CEMEX announced investments in Europe to promote an environmentally-friendly “circular economy,” safely using waste as a substitute for fossil fuels, including in its Rugby plant.

During tests conducted from June 10 to August 5, 2008, the Monterey Bay (California) Unified Air Pollution Control District reported high levels of chromium VI, also known as hexavalent chromium, a cancer causing chemical agent, at an elementary school and fire department in Davenport, California. Chromium VI is the contaminant that inspired the movie, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;. The toxic substance apparently originated from dust emitted by the Cemex Cement plant in Davenport, as the levels of Chromium VI measured eight times the air district&#x27;s acceptable level at Pacific Elementary School and 10 times at the Davenport Fire Department. Both are located less than a half-mile from CEMEX. Chromium VI may have been unwittingly produced at the CEMEX plant in Davenport for the last seven years. According to Ed Kendig, the executive director of the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, it&#x27;s &quot;highly possible&quot; that Chromium VI continues to be produced across the country as an accidental, previously unknown byproduct of the cement-making process.

In 2007, the EPA filed a complaint against CEMEX for violating federal air regulations at its Victorville plant, and in 2006, CEMEX was cited for violations at plants in Santa Barbara and Michigan.

Cemex had a sand mining operation in the city of Marina, California, along the Monterey Bay coastline that concerned environmentalists and scientists. The California Coastal Commission in March 2016 issued a cease and desist order asking for &quot;administration civil penalties&quot;, stating that &quot;the operation is narrowing beaches and impacting environmentally sensitive habitat.&quot; Cemex denied the allegations and continued to operate. A settlement was reached in 2017 and CEMEX ended mining in December 2020.

In 2020 CEMEX announced a new climate action strategy, aiming to lower its overall carbon footprint by 35% in 2030 compared to a 1990 baseline, and to deliver net zero concrete by 2050. In May 2021 CEMEX partnered with British oil company BP to research industry-wide decarbonization of cement production.

In 2024, Oishi (Philippine brand) and CEMEX Asia Holdings Ltd. (Philippines) partnered to support sustainable disposal of plastic waste per commitment to environmental stewardship and circular economy principles in industrial operations. “Our partnership with Liwayway allows us to support them with the EPR law (Extended Producer Responsibility Act EPRA of 2022 Republic Act No. 11898), while it also contributes to our Future in Action agenda of becoming a net zero carbon emission company,” said Luis Franco, Cemex CEO. Liwayway will channel plastic packaging waste to Cemex&#x27;s Solid Cement plant for co-processing.

<doc id="1208872" wikidata="Q2411312" url="?curid=1208872" title="Shannon's source coding theorem">
<text>In information theory, Shannon&#x27;s source coding theorem (or noiseless coding theorem) establishes the statistical limits to possible data compression for data whose source is an independent identically-distributed random variable, and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy.

Named after Claude Shannon, the source coding theorem shows that, in the limit, as the length of a stream of independent and identically-distributed random variable (i.i.d.) data tends to infinity, it is impossible to compress such data such that the code rate (average number of bits per symbol) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source, without it being virtually certain that information will be lost. However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy, with negligible probability of loss.

The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word (which is viewed as a random variable) and of the size of the target alphabet.

Note that, for data that exhibits more dependencies (whose source is not an i.i.d. random variable), the Kolmogorov complexity, which quantifies the minimal description length of an object, is more suitable to describe the limits of data compression. Shannon entropy takes into account only frequency regularities while Kolmogorov complexity takes into account all algorithmic regularities, so in general the latter is smaller. On the other hand, if an object is generated by a random process in such a way that it has only frequency regularities, entropy is close to complexity with high probability (Shen et al. 2017).

== Statements ==

&quot;Source coding&quot; is a mapping from (a sequence of) symbols from an information source to a sequence of alphabet symbols (usually bits) such that the source symbols can be exactly recovered from the binary bits (lossless source coding) or recovered within some distortion (lossy source coding). This is one approach to data compression.

=== Source coding theorem ===
In information theory, the source coding theorem (Shannon 1948) informally states that (MacKay 2003, pg. 81, Cover 2006, Chapter 5):

 i.i.d. random variables each with entropy can be compressed into more than bits with negligible risk of information loss, as ; but conversely, if they are compressed into fewer than bits it is virtually certain that information will be lost.The formula_1 coded sequence represents the compressed message in a biunivocal way, under the assumption that the decoder knows the source. From a practical point of view, this hypothesis is not always true. Consequently, when the entropy encoding is applied the transmitted message is formula_2. Usually, the information that characterizes the source is inserted at the beginning of the transmitted message.

=== Source coding theorem for symbol codes ===
Let denote two finite alphabets and let and denote the set of all finite words from those alphabets (respectively).

Suppose that is a random variable taking values in and let be a uniquely decodable code from to where . Let denote the random variable given by the length of codeword .

If is optimal in the sense that it has the minimal expected word length for , then (Shannon 1948):

:formula_3

Where formula_4 denotes the expected value operator.

== Proof: source coding theorem ==
Given is an i.i.d. source, its time series is i.i.d. with entropy in the discrete-valued case and differential entropy in the continuous-valued case. The Source coding theorem states that for any , i.e. for any rate larger than the entropy of the source, there is large enough and an encoder that takes i.i.d. repetition of the source, , and maps it to binary bits such that the source symbols are recoverable from the binary bits with probability of at least .

Proof of Achievability. Fix some , and let

:formula_5

The typical set, , is defined as follows:

:formula_6

The asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) shows that for large enough , the probability that a sequence generated by the source lies in the typical set, , as defined approaches one. In particular, for sufficiently large , formula_7 can be made arbitrarily close to 1, and specifically, greater than formula_8 (See 
AEP for a proof).

The definition of typical sets implies that those sequences that lie in the typical set satisfy:

:formula_9
*The probability of a sequence formula_10 being drawn from is greater than .
*formula_11, which follows from the left hand side (lower bound) for formula_12.
*formula_13, which follows from upper bound for formula_12 and the lower bound on the total probability of the whole set .

Since formula_15 bits are enough to point to any string in this set.

The encoding algorithm: the encoder checks if the input sequence lies within the typical set; if yes, it outputs the index of the input sequence within the typical set; if not, the encoder outputs an arbitrary digit number. As long as the input sequence lies within the typical set (with probability at least ), the encoder does not make any error. So, the probability of error of the encoder is bounded above by .

&quot;Proof of converse&quot;: the converse is proved by showing that any set of size smaller than (in the sense of exponent) would cover a set of probability bounded away from .

== Proof: Source coding theorem for symbol codes ==
For let denote the word length of each possible . Define formula_16, where is chosen so that . Then

:formula_17

where the second line follows from Gibbs&#x27; inequality and the fifth line follows from Kraft&#x27;s inequality:

:formula_18

so .

For the second inequality we may set

:formula_19

so that

:formula_20

and so

:formula_21

and

:formula_22

and so by Kraft&#x27;s inequality there exists a prefix-free code having those word lengths. Thus the minimal satisfies

:formula_23

==Extension to non-stationary independent sources ==

=== Fixed rate lossless source coding for discrete time non-stationary independent sources===
Define typical set as:

:formula_24

Then, for given , for large enough, . Now we just encode the sequences in the typical set, and usual methods in source coding show that the cardinality of this set is smaller than formula_25. Thus, on an average, bits suffice for encoding with probability greater than , where and can be made arbitrarily small, by making larger.

<doc id="1208874" wikidata="Q195219" url="?curid=1208874" title="Edward II (play)">
<text>The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward the Second, King of England, with the Tragical Fall of Proud Mortimer, known as Edward II, is a Renaissance or early modern period play written by Christopher Marlowe. It is one of the earliest English history plays, and focuses on the relationship between King Edward II of England and Piers Gaveston, and Edward&#x27;s murder on the orders of Roger Mortimer.

Marlowe found most of his material for this play in the third volume of Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; (1587). Frederick S. Boas believes that &quot;out of all the rich material provided by Holinshed&quot; Marlowe was drawn to &quot;the comparatively unattractive reign of Edward II&quot; due to the relationship between the King and Gaveston. Boas elaborates, &quot;Homosexual affection ... has (as has been seen) a special attraction for Marlowe. Jove and Ganymede in &quot;Dido&quot;, Henry III and his &#x27;minions&#x27; in &quot;The Massacre&quot;, Neptune and Leander in &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;, and all akin, although drawn to a slighter scale, to Edward and Gaveston.&quot; Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between &quot;Edward II&quot; and &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot;, asserting that &quot;it is scarcely too much to say that scenes xi–xxi of &quot;The Massacre&quot; are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for &quot;Edward II&quot;.&quot; Marlowe stayed close to the account but embellished it with the character of Lightborn (or Lucifer) as Edward&#x27;s assassin.

==Publication==
The play was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 6 July 1593, five weeks after Marlowe&#x27;s death. The earliest extant edition was published in octavo in 1594, printed by Robert Robinson for the bookseller William Jones; a second edition, issued in 1598, was printed by Richard Braddock for Jones. Subsequent editions were published in 1612, by Richard Barnes, and in 1622, by Henry Bell.

The 1594 first edition of the play is very rare and was uncovered only in 1876. Only one copy, held at the Zentralbibliothek Zürich, was known to exist after a second was lost in the Second World War. In 2012, a third copy was discovered in Germany by Jeffrey Masten. The volume was bound with a treatise arguing against the execution of heretics and another on Turkey and Islam.

==Authorship==
The authorship of the play has never been in doubt. Robert Dodsley included it in his &quot;Select Collection of Old Plays&quot; in 1744, but Marlowe&#x27;s name was not even mentioned in the preface. Marlowe&#x27;s reputation was still damaged by Thomas Beard&#x27;s libel in &quot;The Theatre of God&#x27;s Judgement&quot;, published in 1597.

==Synopsis==
The play telescopes most of Edward II&#x27;s reign into a single narrative, beginning with the recall of his favourite, Piers Gaveston, from exile, and ending with his son, Edward III, executing Mortimer Junior for the king&#x27;s murder.

Marlowe&#x27;s play opens at the outset of the reign, with Edward&#x27;s exiled favourite, Piers Gaveston, rejoicing at the recent death of Edward I and his own resulting ability to return to England. In the following passage he plans the entertainments with which he will delight the king:

Upon Gaveston&#x27;s re-entry into the country, Edward gives him titles, access to the royal treasury, and the option of having guards protect him. Although Gaveston himself is not of noble birth, he maintains that he is better than common people and craves pleasing shows, Italian masques, music and poetry. However, as much as Gaveston pleases the king he finds scant favour from the king&#x27;s nobles, who are soon clamouring for Gaveston&#x27;s exile. Almost as soon as he arrives, Gaveston and Edward&#x27;s court begin to quarrel. Edward is forced to agree to this and banishes Gaveston to Ireland. Isabella of France, the Queen, who still hopes for his favour, persuades Mortimer, who later becomes her lover, to argue for his recall, though only so that he may be more conveniently murdered. The nobles accordingly soon find an excuse to turn on Gaveston again, and eventually capture and execute him. Before executing Gaveston, Edward requests to see Gaveston one more time. Arundel and Pembroke agree to Edward&#x27;s request. However, Warwick attacks and kills Gaveston while he is being taken to Edward. Edward in turn executes two of the nobles who persecuted Gaveston, Warwick and Lancaster.

Edward then seeks comfort in new favourites, Spencer and his father. This alienates Isabella, who takes Mortimer as her lover and travels to France with her son in search of allies. France, however, will not help the queen and refuses to give her arms, although she does get help from Sir John of Hainault. Edward, both in the play and in history, is nothing like the soldier his father was—it was during his reign that the English army was disastrously defeated at Bannockburn—and is soon . Edward takes refuge in Neath Abbey, but is betrayed by a mower, who emblematically carries a scythe. Both Spencers are executed, and the king himself is taken to Kenilworth. His brother Edmund, Earl of Kent, after having initially renounced his cause, now tries to help him but realizes too late the power the young Mortimer now has. Arrested for approaching the imprisoned Edward, Edmund is taken to court, where Mortimer, Isabella and Edward III preside. He is executed by Mortimer, who claims he is a threat to the throne, despite the pleading of Edward III.

The prisoner king is then taken to Berkeley Castle, where he meets the luxuriously cruel Lightborn, whose name is an anglicised version of &quot;Lucifer&quot;. Despite knowing that Lightborn is there to kill him, Edward asks him to stay by his side. Lightborn, realizing that the king will not fall for delay, has him restrained by four men, and murders him by burning out his bowels from the inside with a red hot poker (so as not to leave external marks of violence). Maltravers and Gurney witness this, before Gurney kills Lightborn to keep his silence. Later, however, Gurney flees, and Mortimer sends Maltravers after him, as they fear betrayal. Isabella arrives to warn Mortimer that Edward III, her son with Edward II, has discovered their plot. Before they can plan accordingly, her son arrives with attendants and other lords, accusing Mortimer of murder. Mortimer denies this, but eventually is arrested and taken away. He tells Isabella not to weep for him, and the queen begs her son to show Mortimer mercy, but he refuses. Edward III then orders Mortimer&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s imprisonment, and the play ends with him taking the throne.

== Themes ==
===Homoeroticism===

Edward and Gaveston&#x27;s homoerotic relationship provides the backdrop for the play. When Gaveston plans to produce his masque, he describes &quot;a lovely boy in Dian&#x27;s shape... / And in his sportful hands an olive tree / To hide those parts which men delight to see&quot; (1.2.60–63). Gaveston is deeply aware of the theatre&#x27;s ability to eroticize young male actors. The Queen feels jealous of Gaveston and Edward&#x27;s relationship, noting: &quot;For now my lord the king regards me not, / But dotes upon the love of Gaveston. / He claps his cheeks and hangs about his neck, / Smiles in his face and whispers in his ears&quot; (1.2.49–52).

Much of the criticism on &quot;Edward II&quot; focuses on homoeroticism and power. For example, Emily Bartels&#x27;s &quot;Spectacles of Strangeness&quot;—which focuses on how Marlowe depicts &quot;others&quot; and how that depiction exposes &quot;demonization of the other as a strategy for self-authorization and self-empowerment&quot;—has a chapter on &quot;Edward II&quot; entitled &quot;The Show of Sodomy&quot;. In this chapter, Bartels focuses on how sodomy is politicized, exposed and defined, stating, &quot;In Marlowe, sodomy is finally neither unseeable nor unspeakable. Rather it is exposed as a subject obscured and displayed as beyond display by those who would maintain a hegemonic hold over &#x27;what the matter meant.&#x27;&quot; In order to show how sodomy works in Marlowe&#x27;s plays, Bartels places particular attention to the tension between how sodomy is hidden in the play and then sanctioned as the means of killing Edward. Bartels pays close attention to the fact that Lightborn&#x27;s murder of the king leaves no marks on his body. She concludes that &quot;sodomical leanings...are not politically corrupt. Though largely unspoken, they are not unspeakable.&quot;

Sodomy was not a clearly defined act in the early modern period. Jonathan Goldberg asserts that sodomy was &quot;invisible so long as homosexual acts failed to connect with the much more visible signs of social disruption represented by unorthodox religious or social positions&quot;. David Stymeist reconciles two opposing critical approaches to &quot;Edward II&quot;—one that views the play as subversive towards sexual norms and one that upholds sexual norms—by paying attention to how the play presents alternative sexuality and how it punishes sexual transgressions.

The spatial difference between Ireland and England is the significance of how much Edward&#x27;s state wanted Gaveston gone, but at the same time, if Gaveston travels such distance to see the King, it puts a big spotlight on their desire to see one another and their intimacy.

==== Queer brotherhood ====
Queer brotherhood specifically refers to the sexual brotherhood intertwined with the political aspects of Ireland and England. In &quot;Edward II&quot;, Ireland is a place that accepts sexual brotherhood, and it is the only place, outside of England, that exposes male bonds and extreme homoerotic scenes. The relationship between Gaveston and Edward is interconnected with the political aspects of Ireland and England. Edward referring to Gaveston as a &#x27;Brother&#x27; shows the intimacy between the two rather than just calling him a &#x27;Friend&#x27;.

==== Homophobia ====
Homophobia is represented by the banishment of Gaveston by deceased king Edward I for being a bad influence on King Edward II. Mortimer describes Gaveston as someone who corrupts, dishonors and shames the court of the King, thus showing the homophobia of the state. Mortimer&#x27;s homophobia is possibly rooted from his loyalty to deceased king Edward I, whom he sees as a father figure of the kingdom. Mortimer constantly threatens to kill Gaveston because of his fear of homosexuality. Mortimer has an obsession with his sword, which is associated with a fear of castration as a punishment for sodomy and homosexuality. Throughout the play, Mortimer insults Gaveston as a form of homophobic violence (and he does eventually kill Gaveston and Edward II); it&#x27;s also possible that his extreme violence is rooted from his repressed homosexuality and his fear of feminization. In other words, Mortimer is desperately trying to get rid of people, Gaveston, Edward and Spencer(s), who trigger his homoerotic impulses. The method with which Edward II is assassinated, a hot poker through his anus, is a symbolic death of homophobia of both the state and Mortimer. How Edward II is tortured and killed in the sewer of his castle is symbolic to sodomy and homophobia.

The barons, on the other hand, have a fear of sodomy being a threat to a heterosexual relationship between the queen and the king.

===Religion===

&quot;Edward II&quot; presents tension between the church and the state. When Edward and Gaveston strip the Bishop of Coventry of his lands and possessions, they joke subversively about religious traditions. Edward and Gaveston mock the Bishop as they attack him. Before the play takes place, the Bishop advocates for Gaveston&#x27;s exile. As Edward and Gaveston attack the Bishop, they mock Catholic symbols as they assert their power over the Bishop:
(1.1.185–189)

Edward and Gaveston attack the symbols of the church—baptisms, pardons and church attire—to humiliate the Bishop. After Edward allows Gaveston to take the Bishop&#x27;s possessions, Gaveston states, &quot;A prison may beseem his holiness&quot; (1.1.206). Later in the play, the Archbishop of Canterbury threatens to &quot;discharge these lords / Of duty and allegiance to [Edward]&quot;, and Edward asks, &quot;Why should a king be subject to a priest?&quot; (1.4.61–62, 96). In her essay &quot;Marlowe, History, and Politics&quot;, Paulina Kewes asserts that &quot;Edward II&quot; uses religious history to comment on politics: &quot;Marlowe...[invites] the audience to consider the contingent religious colouring of the conflict between the crown and the nobility...Marlowe&#x27;s target is the widespread use of religion to justify political heterodoxy.&quot;

===Social status===

&quot;Edward II&quot; is a play that is deeply aware of social status and its relationship to birthrights. Mortimer is deeply resentful of Gaveston&#x27;s social mobility and repeatedly claims that Gaveston is &quot;hardly a gentleman by birth&quot; (1.4.29). Later, when Mortimer Senior asserts that &quot;the mightiest kings have had their minions&quot; (1.4.390), Mortimer responds that Gaveston&#x27;s &quot;wanton humour grieves [him] not, but this [he scorns], that one so basely born / Should by his sovereign&#x27;s favour grow so pert / And riot it with the treasure of the realm&quot; (1.4.401–404). The nobility&#x27;s treatment of Spencer and Spencer Senior mirrors their treatment of Gaveston. When Spencer and Lancaster start arguing about treason, Pembroke responds by calling Spencer a &quot;base upstart&quot; (3.3.21). The nobility also call Spencer a flatterer multiple times. However, in &quot;Edward II&quot;, social mobility, social status, and power come with consequences. Clifford Leech shows how the play ties together themes of power, social status, and suffering, stating, &quot;In &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; [Marlowe] had already contemplated power, and saw the spectacle inevitably involved suffering. Here the suffering, still consequential on the exercise and the dream of power, is the major fact.&quot; Leech notes that each of the characters who strives for power or holds a powerful position in the play—Edward, Gaveston, the Queen and Mortimer—each meets a tragic end as they vie for power

==Stage history and adaptations==
According to Andrew Gurr, the first-known performance of &quot;Edward II&quot; was in 1592 by the Earl of Pembroke&#x27;s Men, possibly at the Theatre. Roslyn Knutson has speculated on the original performance for &quot;Edward II&quot;. In her essay, &quot;Marlowe, Company Ownership, and the Role of Edward II&quot;, she argues that &quot;Edward II&quot; was written for Edward Alleyn and Strange&#x27;s Men; however, Pembroke&#x27;s Men performed &quot;Edward II&quot; with Richard Burbage (the most prominent actor in William Shakespeare&#x27;s playing company) as Edward. Knutson uses the number of lines assigned to players, Marlowe&#x27;s familiarity to the different play companies, and the role of Isabella to provide evidence for her argument. She concludes that Burbage&#x27;s performance in &quot;Edward II&quot; influenced how Shakespeare designed roles for Burbage.

The first quarto of 1594 states that the play had been performed by the Earl of Pembroke&#x27;s Men. According to E. K. Chambers, &quot;Edward II&quot; was one of three plays sold to booksellers—along with &quot;The Taming of a Shrew&quot; and &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York&quot;—and was probably the only one of those three not worked on by Shakespeare. Mathew Martin argues that the Roger Barnes&#x27;s 1612 version of &quot;Edward II&quot;—while traditionally seen as a corrupt publishing of the play—reveals how the play was received in Jacobean England and how the play was revised to draw attention to King James&#x27;s controversial promotion of male favorites. The title page of the 1622 edition states that the play was performed by Queen Anne&#x27;s Men at the Red Bull Theatre, showing that &quot;Edward II&quot; was still in the active repertory well into the seventeenth century.

Since the twentieth century, the play has been revived several times, usually in such a way as to make explicit Edward&#x27;s homosexuality.

Marlowe&#x27;s play was revived in November 1961 in a student performance at the University of Nottingham. A 1969 production directed by Clifford Williams for Theatre Toronto featured prominent Stratford Festival actors, including William Hutt as Edward II and Richard Monette as Gaveston.

It was frequently revived in the 1970s. The Prospect Theatre Company&#x27;s production of the play, starring Ian McKellen and James Laurenson, caused a sensation when it was broadcast by the BBC during the 1970s (as it included the first gay kiss transmitted on British television). In 1975 the play was performed on Broadway with Norman Snow as King Edward, Patti LuPone as Prince Edward, David Schramm as Kent, and Peter Dvorsky as Gaveston.

In 1977, the 26-episode BBC radio drama &quot;Vivat Rex&quot; included an abridged version of the play as its first two episodes. John Hurt portrayed Edward.

In 1986, Nicholas Hytner directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Ian McDiarmid, Michael Grandage, Iain Glen and Duncan Bell.

Numerous other productions followed, starring actors such as Simon Russell Beale and Joseph Fiennes. 

In 1991, the play was adapted into a film by Derek Jarman which used modern costumes and made overt reference to the gay rights movement and the Stonewall riots. In 1995 a ballet adaptation was created for Stuttgart Ballet.

The Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Shakespeare Theatre Company 2007 staging used mostly fascist-era and jazz-age costumes. The production strongly emphasized the gay relationship between Edward II and Gaveston and was one of two Marlowe works inaugurating the company&#x27;s new Sidney Harman Hall.

In 2011, EM-LOU Productions staged the play at The Rose Theatre, Bankside, returning it for the first time in 400 years to the space where it may have had its very first production. The production was directed by Peter Darney.

In October 2013, the New National Theatre Tokyo staged the play in Japanese, featuring Mori Shintaro as a director.

In July 2016, an adaptation opened at Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, Australia, directed by Matthew Lutton and written by Anthony Weigh.

In January 2019, An Other Theater Company in Provo, Utah staged the play for the first time in the state. The production was co-directed by Jessamyn Svensson and Kailey Azure Green.

In December 2019, the play was once again revived by the Nottingham New Theatre at the University of Nottingham, 59 years after the first revival.

For 2025, the play has been scheduled for a February-April performance by the Royal Shakespeare Company, at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon, with Daniel Evans in the titular role.

===Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s adaptation===

The play was adapted by Bertolt Brecht and Lion Feuchtwanger in 1923 as &quot;The Life of Edward II of England&quot; (&quot;Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England&quot;). The Brecht version, while acknowledging Marlowe&#x27;s play as its source, uses Brecht&#x27;s own words, ideas and structure, and is regarded as a separate work. The German premiere took place in 1924 under Brecht&#x27;s direction at the Munich Kammerspiele with Erwin Faber and Hans Schweikart as Edward and Baldock; the New York premiere of Brecht&#x27;s play took place in 1982, staged by W. Stuart McDowell by the Riverside Shakespeare Company, sponsored by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at The Shakespeare Center on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side.

<text>The A5199 road is the direct road from Northampton to Leicester in England. It was formerly part of the A50 trunk road that ran from Bedfordshire to Lancashire. For most of its length it is known as the Welford Road, except for small stretches near Welford where it is known as High Street and Northampton Road, and a section near Wigston Magna where it is known as Bull Head Street.

As its course is broadly parallel and near to the M1 motorway, it&#x27;s very much lacking in modern features such as bypasses, which is why it was classified downwards when the A14 road, which it crosses at Junction 1, was built as a link between the M1/M6 junction and the East Coast ports.

== Settlements on the A5199 ==
The road commences in the Freemen&#x27;s district of inner city Leicester at the junction with the A594 Leicester Central Ring.

<text>Bacalao, Bacallao, or Terra do Bacalhau was a phantom island depicted on several early 16th century Portuguese maps and nautical charts. The name is a variation of &quot;bacalhau,&quot; meaning &quot;cod&quot; or &quot;stockfish&quot;.

According to Gaspar Frutuoso in his work &quot;Saudades da Terra&quot;, written in the 1570s, a joint crew of Didrik Pining, John Scolvus, Hans Pothorst, Álvaro Martins, and João Vaz Corte-Real in 1472 was granted lands in the Azores by the king of Portugal, because of his discovery of the &quot;Terras do Bacalhau&quot;. Historians do not consider the work of Frutuoso as very reliable, as it contains a great deal of misinformation.

Off the northwest tip of Newfoundland&#x27;s Avalon Peninsula is an island named Bacalaos, known to Europeans by that name since at least 1556, when it was drawn on the Gastaldi map as &quot;Bacalaos&quot;.

In January 1945, the destroyer was involved in the Burma campaign, before being transferred from the British Eastern Fleet to the British Pacific Fleet. During April and May, &quot;Norman&quot; was involved in the Battle of Okinawa, but then spent the rest of World War II as the duty destroyer at Manus Island.

&quot;Norman&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy in October 1945. The ship was not reactivated, and was broken up for scrap in 1958.

==Design and construction==
The N-class destroyer had a displacement of 1,773 tons at standard load, and 2,550 tons at full load. &quot;Norman&quot; was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared steam turbines, which provided 40,000 shaft horsepower to the ship&#x27;s two propellers. &quot;Norman&quot; was capable of reaching . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 226 officers and sailors.

The ship&#x27;s armament consisted of six 4.7-inch QF Mark XII guns in three twin mounts, a single 4-inch QF Mark V gun, a 2-pounder 4-barrel Pom Pom, four 0.5-inch machine guns, four 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, four .303 Lewis machine guns, two Pentad torpedo launcher tube sets (with 10 torpedoes carried), two depth-charge throwers and one depth-charge chute (with 45 charges carried). The 4-inch gun was removed later in &quot;Norman&quot;″s career.

The destroyer was laid down by John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company at Southampton, England on 27 July 1939. She was launched on 30 October 1940. &quot;Norman&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 29 September 1941; although operated as an Australian warship, the vessel remained the property of the Royal Navy. The ship takes her name from the Normans, with her ship&#x27;s badge depicting a Norman warrior&#x27;s helmet. She was the only N-class destroyer to be given a motto: &quot;Cedere Nescio&quot; or &quot;I Know Not How To Yield&quot;. Construction cost 402,939 pounds.

==Operational history==
The destroyer&#x27;s first mission after completing sea trials in October 1941 was to deliver a British trade union delegation from Iceland to Russia. &quot;Norman&quot; then spent some time as an escort ship, then sailed to Southampton for minor modifications. At the start of 1942, the destroyer was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet. From January until May, &quot;Norman&quot; served as a convoy escort in the Indian Ocean, before being recalled to participate in the convoy escort screen for Operation Vigorous, one of two major convoys attempting to supply the island of Malta. After this, she returned to the Indian Ocean, and during September was involved in the Madagascar campaign. The destroyer spent the remainder of 1942, all of 1943, and the early part of 1944 on uneventful patrols of the Indian Ocean. In late March 1944, &quot;Norman&quot; sailed to Sydney for a two-month-long refit. This concluded in late June, and &quot;Norman&quot; returned to the Eastern Fleet.

In January 1945, &quot;Norman&quot; became involved in the campaign to free Burma from the Japanese. On 21 January, the ship helped land Indian troops on Ramree Island as part of Operation Matador, then bombarded Cheduba Island five days later prior to the landing of Royal Marines. On 1 March, the ship sailed to Australia to join the British Pacific Fleet. As part of the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Norman&quot; was involved in the Battle of Okinawa during April and May, but left before the operation&#x27;s conclusion to escort the collision-damaged destroyer as she was towed to Leyte for repairs. After delivering her charge, &quot;Norman&quot; joined the United States Fifth Fleet for a short period, then sailed for Australia, arriving in Sydney on 6 June. The destroyer returned to service in early July, and was assigned to Manus Island as the general duty destroyer until the end of World War II. After the war&#x27;s end, &quot;Norman&quot; sailed to Japan, but did not arrive to participate in the Japanese surrender.

The destroyer&#x27;s wartime service was recognised with the battle honours &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–44&quot;, &quot;East Indies 1944&quot;, &quot;Burma 1944–45&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Norman&quot; returned to Sydney in October 1945, and was decommissioned and returned to the Royal Navy in exchange for the Q-class destroyer . &quot;Norman&quot; was not reactivated; instead, she was sold off in 1955, and in 1958 was broken up for scrap.

<text>Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero (16 March 1585 – 23 August 1618) was a Dutch poet and playwright in the period known as the Dutch Golden Age.

==Life==

Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero was born on 16 March 1585 in Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic, where he lived his whole life. He called himself &quot;G.A. Bredero, Amstelredammer&quot;, and sometimes he is called &quot;Breero&quot; or &quot;Brederode&quot;. He was the third child of Marry Gerbrants and Adriaen Cornelisz Bredero, who was a shoemaker and a successful real estate agent. Bredero was born in the &quot;Nes&quot;, nowadays number 41, and in 1602 he and his family moved to a house on Oudezijds Voorburgwal, now number 244, which his father had bought. Bredero lived in this house for the rest of his life. Both houses are now restaurants in Amsterdam&#x27;s famous red light district.

At school Bredero learned French and possibly also some English and Latin. Later he was educated as an artist by the Antwerp painter Francesco Badens, but none of his paintings have survived. In 1611 he became a member of the &quot;rederijkerskamer&quot; &quot;d&#x27;Eglantier&quot;, where he was an active member and became friends with Roemer Visscher and P.C.Hooft. Together with Hooft he joined Costers &quot;Nederduytsche Academie&quot;. Around this time he wrote the play &quot;De Spaanschen Brabander Jerolimo&quot;.

The only public position Bredero achieved was as &quot;vaandrig&quot; or standard bearer of the civic guard. On 23 August 1618, at the age of 33, Bredero suddenly died, shortly after he had recovered from pneumonia that he had contracted after falling through ice. He never married.

<text>Withyham is a village and large civil parish in the Wealden district of East Sussex, England. The village is situated 7 miles south west of Royal Tunbridge Wells and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from Crowborough; the parish covers approximately .

==Geography==

Withyham parish lies on the edge of Weald, in the valley of the River Medway, where a group of tributaries enter from the south, and to the north of Ashdown Forest. The B2110 road passes through the village, between Groombridge and Forest Row. Much of the area is rural; the hamlet of Buckhurst, part of the parish, contains Buckhurst Park, the home of Lord De La Warr. New Groombridge is also within the parish, and Old Groombridge is in the Speldhurst parish of Kent.

Withyham village itself is very small, containing a few houses, the church, a bed and breakfast, and the Dorset Arms (a village pub which was once a farmhouse).

==History==
===Buckhurst and Gildredge===
Withyham is not included in the Domesday Book, although the manor of Buckhurst is, as &quot;Biochest&quot; (probably from the Saxon &quot;boc hyrst&quot; or beech wood. There have been two houses at Buckhurst for many centuries: the older Buckhurst House, now no more, and the present day Buckhurst Park: both remained in the hands of the Sackville family for generations. Buckhurst Park is the family seat of the De La Warr earldom, and William Sackville, 11th Earl De La Warr continues to live there.

Outside Buckhurst, many of the houses in the village were probably built to contain estate workers. A significant number of council houses were built in the post-war period at Balls Green, near a now-closed railway station.

Withyham was also home to the Gildredge family, who later moved to Eastbourne, acquiring a large share of the town&#x27;s land by purchase and through marriage. &quot;Gildredge House and estate was formerly the property and residence of the family of the same name,&quot; says Thomas Walker Horsfield in his history of Sussex, &quot;who afterwards (temp. Henry VIII) removed to and became lords of the manor of Eastbourne.&quot; Today&#x27;s Gildredge Park in Eastbourne is named after the family. The Gildredge family was related to the Eversfield family, who eventually owned much of St. Leonards-on-Sea, as well as to the Levetts.

According to the Sussex historian Mark Antony Lower, the ancient house and estate of Gildredge &quot;gave name to a family of considerable antiquity, who subsequently had their chief residence at Eastbourne, and gave their name to the manor of Eastbourne-Gildredge.&quot; Later the Gildredge lands were carried by marriage into the Gilbert family (today&#x27;s Davies-Gilbert family), who continue to own much of Eastbourne.

Withyham parish is in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

===Withyham church===
Much of the oldest available historical information concerning the Weald of Kent, Sussex and Surrey, with records going back to 1288, relates to the parish church, St. Michael&#x27;s.
The village church is dedicated to St Michael and All Angels; the present rector is the Reverend Canon James Campbell. According to early records, the church was almost completely rebuilt in the 14th century to contain a Sackville chapel.

On 16 June 1663 the church was struck by lightning, which melted the bells and caused a great deal of damage; few parts of the building survived. The rebuilding of the church does not seem to have been finished until 1672, and the Sackville Chapel was not completed for a further eight years. Of the old church, only the lower part of the tower, the west wall from the belfry door to the north-west corner, and the north and south-east walls remained to be incorporated into the new building. It was also around this time that the rectory was built.

Later important alterations were carried out in the 19th century, including a new south aisle, the removal of the low ceiling, and the construction of a new south porch. In 1849, a set of four paintings was donated to the church: it is thought they are the work of Niccolò di Pietro Gerini (c. 1340–1414). The paintings were sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in London in 2012.

There are eight bells in the tower. Five bells were recast after the rebuilding in 1674, and a sixth (treble) bell was added in 1715. These bells remained until 1908, when they were recast and a further two added.

The ashes of David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir are buried at the church. Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset is buried there as well, as are the ashes of author and garden designer, Vita Sackville-West.

The church is also a filming location used in the 1976 concert film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; featuring the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is the location for the night time fantasy scene starring Led Zeppelin&#x27;s bass and keyboard player John Paul Jones.

==Governance==
Withyham is a large parish, and is therefore divided into three electoral wards: Groombridge; Withyham, including Blackham; and St Johns (Withyham).

==Landmarks==
Penn&#x27;s Rocks is a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the parish. This is a site of biological interest. Its sandstone outcrops providing a rare habitat for many ferns and bryophytes. Buckhurst Park historic seat of the Earls De La Warr, head of the Sackville family, Lutyens/Jekyll garden with Repton Park. The Hundred Acre wood, immortalised by A.A. Milne in his Winnie-the-Pooh stories, is part of the Buckhurst Estate

==The millennium in Withyham==
To celebrate the millennium in Withyham, the 11th Earl De La Warr planted a yew sapling taken from a tree said to be 2,000 years old – i.e. from the time of Christ. The sapling was uprooted by vandals, but was replanted by Earl De La Warr. A millennium map was also commissioned by the Church to commemorate almost 1,000 years of Withyham.

==Public transport==
The village has a regular bus service. The Metrobus 291 bus route serves East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells, and Crawley – as well as neighbouring villages.

In nearby Ashurst there is a railway station. Ashurst station is on the Uckfield to London line via Oxted and East Croydon. Trains are hourly in each direction.

<text>POEMS syndrome (also termed osteosclerotic myeloma, Crow–Fukase syndrome, Takatsuki disease, or PEP syndrome) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome caused by a clone of aberrant plasma cells. The name POEMS is an acronym for some of the disease&#x27;s major signs and symptoms ([[POEMS syndrome|p]]olyneuropathy, [[POEMS syndrome|o]]rganomegaly, [[POEMS syndrome|e]]ndocrinopathy, [[POEMS syndrome|m]]yeloma protein, and [[POEMS syndrome|s]]kin changes), as is PEP ([[POEMS syndrome|p]]olyneuropathy, [[POEMS syndrome|e]]ndocrinopathy, [[POEMS syndrome|p]]lasma cell dyscrasia).

The signs and symptoms of most neoplasms are due to their mass effects caused by the invasion and destruction of tissues by the neoplasms&#x27; cells. Signs and symptoms of a cancer causing a paraneoplastic syndrome result from the release of humoral factors such as hormones, cytokines, or immunoglobulins by the syndrome&#x27;s neoplastic cells and/or the response of the immune system to the neoplasm. Many of the signs and symptoms in POEMS syndrome are due at least in part to the release of an aberrant immunoglobulin, i.e. a myeloma protein, as well as certain cytokines by the malignant plasma cells.

POEMS syndrome typically begins in middle age – the average age at onset is 50 – and affects up to twice as many men as women.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of POEMS syndrome are highly variable. This often leads to long delays (e.g. 13–18 months) between the onset of initial symptoms and diagnosis. In addition to the signs and symptoms indicated by the POEMS acronym, the PEST acronym is used to describe some of the other signs and symptoms of the disease. PEST stands for Papilledema, evidence of Extravascular volume overload (ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lower extremity edema), Sclerotic bone lesions, and Thrombocytosis/erythrocytosis (i.e. increased in blood platelets and red blood cells). Other features of the disease include a tendency toward leukocytosis, blood clot formation, abnormal lung function (restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired lung diffusion capacity), very high blood levels of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and an overlap with the signs and symptoms of multicentric Castleman disease.

=== Common features ===
The more common features of the disease are summarized in the acronym POEMS:
Papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) often but not always due to increased intracranial pressure) is the most common ocular sign of POEMS syndrome, occurring in ≥29% of cases. Less frequent ocular findings include cystoid macular edema, serous macular detachment, infiltrative orbitopathy, and venous sinus thrombosis. Some features have been observed in patients with POEMS syndrome but are not yet certain to form part of the syndrome itself. These include a predisposition to forming blood clots, joint pain, cardiomyopathy (systolic dysfunction), fever, low vitamin B12 levels, and diarrhea.

== Pathogenesis ==
While the main features of this paraneoplastic disease have been described, the exact mechanism behind its development, progression, and manifestations remain elusive. Overproduction of the myeloma protein and VEGF may underlie some, but are insufficient to explain all, of the multi-organ features of the disease. It is suggested that various other cytokines produced by the clonal plasma cells, perhaps working in concert with each other as well as with VEGF and the myeloma proteins, mediate many of the features of POEMS syndrome. The other cytokines detected in, and suspected of contributing to, POEMS syndrome include interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and TNFα. Nonetheless, it seems likely that some of these paraneoplastic factors, operating individually, make a major contribution to certain features of the disease. For example, VEGF, given its ability to stimulate blood vessel formation, would seem likely to be the major contributor to the pathologic hyper-vascularization changes seem in many tissues, such as lymph nodes, affected by POEMS syndrome.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is based on meeting its two mandatory criteria, meeting at least one of its 3 other major criteria, and meeting at least one of its 6 minor criteria.

=== Mandatory criteria ===
==== Polyneuropathy ====

Subacute, distal, symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy with allodynia and hyperpathia is the most frequent presentation of POEMS syndrome. Neuropathy is often the first trait, and it may be the only initial symptom. Clinical examination may show distal wasting, weakness, and sensory impairment affecting both large and small fibre sensory modalities.

==== Plasma cell dyscrasia ====

Plasma cell dyscrasias are a group of monoclonal gammopathies in which normal plasma cells in the bone marrow and soft tissues become altered. POEMS syndrome is often associated with an IgA or IgG lambda limited plasma cell dysfunction. On iliac crest biopsies, patients with POEMS syndrome often have few monoclonal plasma cells. In patients with localized illness, iliac crest biopsies may be normal. Other common findings were megakaryocyte hyperplasia and clustering, as well as unusual megakaryocyte appearances. Atypical plasma cells invade normal marrow in osteosclerotic lesions, causing sclerosis of the bony lamellae.

=== Major criteria ===
==== Castleman&#x27;s disease ====

Castleman&#x27;s disease (CD) is a rare heterogeneous lymph node disorder characterized by elevated interleukin-6 levels. Neuropathy can occur in CD patients with or without POEMS syndrome. CD and POEMS tend to overlap, with roughly 15–24% of POEMS syndrome patients also having CD, with the majority having hyaline vascular type.

==== Sclerotic bone lesions ====
Osteosclerotic lesions have been documented in around 95% of patients. Bone lesions can be sclerotic, lytic with sclerotic rims, or a mixture of the two with a soup-bubble look. About half of the patients have a single bone lesion, whereas the other half have several lesions. The most prevalent locations for bone lesions are the pelvis, spine, ribs, and proximal extremities.

==== Vascular endothelial growth factor ====

VEGF levels in plasma and serum are significantly higher in POEMS patients and correlate with illness activity. Osteoblasts, bone tissue, macrophages, tumor cells, plasma cells, and megakaryocytes all express VEGF; both IL1 and IL6 have been proven to increase VEGF synthesis. VEGF normally targets endothelial cells and causes an increase in vascular permeability that is both fast and reversible. Increased VEGF could explain several clinical features of POEMS, including organomegaly, edema, skin abnormalities, and neuropathy, as well as increasing microvascular permeability of blood vessels with endoneurial edema.

=== Minor criteria ===
==== Organomegaly ====

POEMS syndrome has been associated with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy in 50–78% of patients. Organomegaly is usually minimal, and bulky disease is uncommon.

==== Extravascular volume overload ====

80% of POEMS patients are reported to have extravascular volume overload including, peripheral edema, ascites, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Ascites and peripheral edema are more prevalent than pleural or pericardial effusions. Extravascular volume overload can cause significant morbidity and corresponds with a lower survival rate.

==== Endocrinopathy ====

Approximately 84% of POEMS syndrome patients have characteristics of several endocrinopathies. Hypogonadism is the most prevalent endocrine disorder, followed by thyroid anomalies, glucose metabolism defects, and adrenal insufficiency. Men frequently experience impotence and gynecomastia. Amenorrhea tends to be common in women. The cause of endocrinopathy is unknown, however VEGF may have a role.

==== Skin changes ====

About 90–100% of those with POEMS syndrome will experience skin changes. The most common manifestations are hyperpigmentation and haemangiomas. Other skin abnormalities include thickening, hypertrichosis, acquired facial lipoatrophy, and infiltrating livedo reticularis with necrosis. POEMS syndrome can also cause Vascular-type skin changes including acrocyanosis, flushing, hyperaemia, and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon. Nail changes consist of leukonychia and clubbing.

==== Papilledema ====

Papilledema is often one of the earliest signs of POEMS disease and is usually bilateral. Patients tend to be asymptomatic, however, they may report headaches, brief obscurations of vision, scotomata, large blind spots, and gradual visual field constriction. Papilledema has been noted in 29–64% of patients and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis.

==== Hematological alterations ====

50% of POEMS patients have thrombocytosis and polyglobulia develops in 15% of patients.  Those with thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis are often misdiagnosed with chronic myeloproliferative disease before POEMS syndrome is identified.

=== Laboratory findings ===
In addition to tests corresponding to the above findings, such as EMG for neuropathy, CT scan, bone marrow biopsy to detect clonal plasma cells, plasma or serum protein electrophoresis to myeloma proteins, other tests can give abnormal results supporting the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome. These included raised blood levels of VEGF, thrombocytes, and/or erythrocyte parameters.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Patients diagnosed as having Castleman disease but also exhibiting many of the symptoms and signs of POEMS syndrome but lacking evidence of a peripheral neuropathy and clonal plasma cells should not be diagnosed as having POEMS syndrome. They are better classified as having Castleman disease variant of POEMS syndrome. These patients may exhibit high blood levels of the interleukin-6 cytokine and have an inferior overall survival compared to POEMS syndrome patients. Treatment of patients with this POEMS syndrome variant who have evidence of bone lesions and/or myeloma proteins are the same as those for POEMS syndrome patients. In the absence of these features, treatment with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody preparation directed against B cells bearing the CD20 antigen, or siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody preparation directed against interleukin-6, may be justified.

== Treatment ==
As reported by Dispenzieri &quot;et al.&quot; Mayo Clinic treatment regimens are tailored to treat the clinical manifestations and prognosis for the rate of progression of the POEMS syndrome in each patient. In rare cases, patients may have minimal or no symptoms at presentation or after successful treatment of their disorder. These patients may be monitored every 2–3 months for symptoms and disease progression. Otherwise, treatment is divided based on the local versus systemic spread of its clonal plasma cells. Patients with one or two plasmacytoma bone lesions and no clonal plasma cells in their bone marrow biopsy specimens are treated by surgical removal or radiotherapy of their tumors. These treatments can relieve many of the syndromes clinical manifestations including neuropathies, have a 10-year overall survival of 70% and a 6-year progression-free survival of 62%. Patients with &gt;2 plasmacytoma bone lesions and/or increases in bone marrow clonal plasma cells are treated with a low-dose or high-dose chemotherapy regimen, i.e. a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone plus an alkylating agents such as melphalan. Dosage regimens are selected on the basis of patient tolerance. Hematological response rates to the dexamethasone/melphalan regimens have been reported to be in the 80% range with neurological response rates approaching 100%. Patients successfully treated with the high-dose dexamethasone/melphalan regimen have been further treated with autologous stem cell transplantation. In 59 patients treated with the chemotherapy/transplantation regimen, the Mayo Clinic reported progression-free survival rates of 98%, 94%, and 75% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively.

Other treatment regimens are being studied. Immunomodulatory imide drugs such as thalidomide and lenalidomide have been used in combination with dexamethasone to treat POEMS syndrome patients. While the mechanism of action of these immunomodulators are not clear, they do inhibit the production of cytokines suspected of contributing to POEMS syndrome such as VEGF, TNFα, and IL-6 and stimulate T cells and NK cells to increase their production of interferon gamma and interleukin 2 (see immunomodulatory imide drug&#x27;s mechanism of action). A double blind study of 25 POEMS syndrome patients found significantly better results (VEGF reduction, neuromuscular function improvement, quality of life improvement) in patients treated with thalidomide plus dexamethasone compared to patients treated with a thalidomide placebo plus dexamethasone.

Since VEGF plays a central role in the symptoms of POEMS syndrome, some have tried bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF. While some reports were positive, others have reported capillary leak syndrome suspected to be the result of overly rapid lowering of VEGF levels. It therefore remains doubtful as to whether this will become part of standard treatment for POEMS syndrome.

== History ==
R. S. Crow, working in Bristol, first described the combination of osteosclerotic myeloma, polyneuropathy and various unusual features (such as pigmentation and clubbing) in two patients aged 54 and 67, in 1956.

<text>Gower Carlyle Champion (June 22, 1919 – August 25, 1980) was an American actor, theatre director, choreographer, and dancer.

==Early years==

Champion was born on June 22, 1919, in Geneva, Illinois, as the son of John W. Champion and Beatrice Carlisle. He was raised in Los Angeles, California, where he graduated from Fairfax High School. He studied dance from an early age and, at the age of fifteen, toured nightclubs with friend Jeanne Tyler billed as &quot;Gower and Jeanne, America&#x27;s Youngest Dance Team&quot;. In 1939, &quot;Gower and Jeanne&quot; danced to the music of Larry Clinton and his Orchestra in a Warner Brothers &amp; Vitaphone film short-subject, &quot;The Dipsy Doodler&quot; (released in 1940).

==Career==
During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Champion worked on Broadway as a solo dancer and choreographer. After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, Champion met Marjorie Belcher, who became his new partner, and the two were married in 1947.

In the early 1950s, Marge and Gower Champion made seven film musicals: &quot;Mr. Music&quot; (1950, with Bing Crosby), the 1951 remake of &quot;Show Boat&quot; (with Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson), 1952&#x27;s &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot; (a remake of &quot;Roberta&quot;, also with Keel and Grayson), the autobiographical &quot;Everything I Have Is Yours&quot; (1952), &quot;Give a Girl a Break&quot; (1953, with Debbie Reynolds and Bob Fosse), &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1955, with Keel and Esther Williams), and &quot;Three for the Show&quot; (1955, with Betty Grable and Jack Lemmon). All were made for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer except &quot;Mr. Music&quot; (Paramount) and &quot;Three for the Show&quot; (Columbia).

Throughout the 1950s, they performed on a number of television variety shows, and in 1957 they starred in their own short-lived CBS sitcom, &quot;The Marge and Gower Champion Show&quot;, which was based on their actual career experiences.

Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;. Mary Healy guessed who they were.

In 1948, Champion had begun to direct as well, and he won the first of eight Tony Awards for his staging of &quot;Lend an Ear&quot;, the show that introduced Carol Channing to New York City theater audiences. During the 1950s, he worked on only two Broadway musicals — choreographing &quot;Make a Wish&quot; in 1951 and directing, staging, and starring in &quot;3 for Tonight&quot; in 1955 — preferring to spend most of his time in Hollywood. However, in the 1960s, he directed a number of Broadway hits that put him at the top of his profession.

===1960 to 1964===

He had a solid success in 1960 with &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, a show about an Elvis-like rock star about to be inducted into the army. The show starred Chita Rivera and Dick Van Dyke along with a youthful cast. It ran for 607 performances and won four Tony awards, including Best Musical and two for Champion&#x27;s direction and choreography. Next came &quot;Carnival!&quot; in 1961, which ran for 719 performances and garnered seven Tony nominations, including one for Champion&#x27;s direction. In 1964, Champion directed one of Broadway&#x27;s biggest blockbusters, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. It ran for 2,844 performances — almost seven years! Starring Carol Channing as Dolly Levi, it is perhaps best remembered for the title number, where Dolly is greeted by the staff of a restaurant after having been away for years. The show won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, as well as two for Champion&#x27;s direction and choreography.

===1964 to 1980===

Champion had his fourth consecutive hit musical with &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; in 1966. It featured a cast of two — veterans Mary Martin and Robert Preston — playing a couple seen throughout the years of their marriage. The show ran for 560 performances and received seven Tony nominations, including one for Champion&#x27;s direction.

His next show, &quot;The Happy Time&quot; in 1968, broke his streak. It had a relatively disappointing run of only 286 performances. This would be followed by many more disappointments and worse on Broadway. 

In 1969, Champion was the producer, choreographer and director of the 41st Academy Awards ceremony, which earned mostly favourable reviews.

In the 1970s, Champion directed minor hits (&quot;Sugar&quot; in 1972 and the revival &quot;Irene&quot; in 1973), flops (&quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; in 1974) and complete disasters (&quot;Rockabye Hamlet&quot; — seven performances in 1976 — and &quot;A Broadway Musical&quot;, running only one night in 1978, not to mention &quot;Prettybelle&quot;, which closed out of town in 1971). On top of this, he and Marge were divorced in 1973.

After the failures of the previous decade, Champion was able to make a comeback with his longest-running show. In 1980, he choreographed and directed a stage adaptation of the movie classic, &quot;42nd Street&quot;. It won the Tony for Best Musical, and Champion was nominated for his direction and choreography, winning for the latter. The show ran for 3,486 performances, but Champion did not live to see one, having died in the morning on opening day.

==Personal life==

Champion was married in 1947 to actress Marjorie Celeste Belcher, who became famous as Marge Champion. Together, they had two sons: Blake and director Gregg Champion. They divorced in January 1973. In 1976, he married Karla Russell.

He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

===Death===

Champion was diagnosed in early 1979 with Waldenström&#x27;s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of blood cancer, by his doctors at the Scripps Institute. He began treatment at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles and was advised not to take on work. Champion died at 10:00 a.m. on August 25, 1980, in Manhattan at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

Champion&#x27;s death came only ten hours before the opening-night performance of &quot;42nd Street&quot;, the Broadway musical he choreographed and directed. It would be his swan song, running nine years. Producer David Merrick asked Champion&#x27;s family to withhold the news from everyone, including the show&#x27;s cast, until after the opening performance. During the enthusiastic curtain calls, Merrick came onstage and made the announcement to the stunned cast and audience amidst the wild applause. &quot;This is a very tragic moment,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to have to report that today, Gower Champion died.&quot;

<doc id="1208935" wikidata="Q496402" url="?curid=1208935" title="Upo Wetland">
<text>Upo Wetland () is a complex of natural wetlands located in Changnyeong County, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is located in portions of Yueo-myeon, Ibang-myeon and Daehap-myeon, near the Nakdong River. It derives its name from the largest of the wetlands, Upo. Other wetlands in the complex include Mokpo, Sajipo and Jjokjibeol wetlands. The complex as a whole covers 2.13 km2, and is the largest inland wetland in South Korea today. It is one of eight Ramsar wetlands in the country and one of the official visiting sites for the 10th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties that was held in Changwon, Korea in October, 2008.

==History==
Most of Upo has been protected since 1997 and is now part of the Upo Ecological Park. However, agricultural and fishing activity still takes place on the wetland. A growing eco-tourism sector has developed in the country, although many local residents remain hostile to the idea of protected land.

==Environment==
===Flora and fauna===
Upo is home to numerous endangered, threatened and rare species. Based on a 1997 survey, the wetland is believed to be home to a total of 342 endangered or threatened species: 168 species of plants, 62 species of birds, 55 species of arthropods, 28 species of fish, 12 species of mammals, 7 species of reptiles, 5 species of amphibians, and 5 species of molluscs. The most famous rare plant found here is the prickly lotus. A notable reptile species is the Reeves&#x27; turtle.

A particularly noted bird species is the black-faced spoonbill. Upo provides habitat to large numbers of migrant birds, including other rare species such as the white-naped crane and taiga bean goose. There is a restoration project to reintroduce the crested ibis to Upo. Last seen in 2003, the crested ibis is a symbol of Gyengnam Province. The wetland has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of whooper swans, bean geese, falcated ducks, mallards, northern pintails, white-naped cranes and oriental storks.

==Community function==
===Upo Wetland Ecological Center===
Established to facilitate the growing eco-tourism industry in South Korea, the center provides visitors with the opportunity to learn the importance of biodiversity and ecological preservation. An extensive history of the wetlands is on display as well as a number of other exhibits that pertain to the species that inhabit Upo. Constructed in 2007, approximately 150,000 people visit the center annually. Although the vast majority of the visitors are Korean, the Ecological Center provides brochures in English, Japanese and Chinese.

===Habitat===
Upo provides a habitat for a number of threatened and endangered species.

===Flood and drought prevention===
During the monsoon months of July and August, the wetlands act like a sponge to soak up the water and prevent flood damage to the surrounding agricultural areas. Throughout the year the wetlands also provide water during times of drought to the local rice and onion farmers.

===Water purification===
Plants such as the sweet flag and sangigarae feed on nutrients that normally cause water rot, keeping the water inside the wetland clean.

===Food for the local community===
Fish and plants provide the local community with a steady supply of food throughout the year. The crucian carp is a local delicacy and is very abundant throughout the wetland. During the fall harvest, locals collect water chestnuts from the floor of the wetland. In order to promote preservation, the Korean Ministry of Environment allows only thirteen local fish farmers to take fish from the wetlands. Local community members oppose the regulations, although through the center, an effort to invoke cooperation has been implemented.

===Ecological and environmental education===
The various plants and animals living in the wetland provide both educational and scientific opportunities. By teaching the public preservation and ecological sustainability, Upo Wetland directs the visitor&#x27;s attention to developmental cooperation with the local community.

== Birds ==

Nonmigratory birds: Throughout the year a number of species remain in the wetland. Birds like the long-tailed tit, titmouse, flycatcher, pigeon and magpie all stay throughout the year. Also some of the migratory birds have become sedentary due to the favorable conditions of Upo.

== Fish and shellfish ==
Upo provides a sanctuary for a number of different fish species, both native and invasive. Also the abundance of shellfish provide food for the larger animals occupying Upo.
==Plants==
===Plants growing at the waters edge===
*Pampas grass
*Cattail
*Sweet flag
*Wild rice

===Plants with leaves above the water===
*Water chestnut
*Water lotus
*Bladderwort

===Underwater plants===
*Eelgrass

===Plants floating on the water===
*Duckweed
*Frogbit grass

==Water insects and crustaceans==
*Diving beetle: Both the larva and adult diving beetle, also referred to as an underwater cleaner, are carnivorous. The adult diving beetle emerges from the moist earth from hibernation and pupation.
*Mulijarus japonicus: The &quot;Mulijarus japonica&quot; carries eggs on its back and can easily be found in the waters around many plants like wild rice and club rush. Also called the snapping turtle, it is one of the most prominent water insects in Upo Wetland.
*Water strider: The water strider is most easily found on the surface of the water moving like it is skating on the top of the water, using the thin hairs of its legs.
*Gaeajaebi: The gaeajaebi lives in the lakes of the wetland feeding on small fish and insects.
*Horn dragonfly: The adult horn dragonfly lives on land, while most of the larvae reside in the water of the wetland. The larvae feed on small insects such as mosquitoes.
*Damselfly: The damselfly lays its eggs by inserting the egg-laying pipe into the stalks or leaves in the water plants and end up spending the majority of its youth in the water.
*Water scorpion: The water scorpion is found primarily at the edge of the wetland. A reclusive hunter, it hides in the leaves waiting for its prey to pass.
*Long tailed helmet shrimp: Introduced to the wetland from Central America, the long tailed helmet shrimp is not frequently found in Upo Wetland. Although in the surrounding area the long tailed helmet shrimp is commonly found in the rice paddies usually right after the seasonal flooding. White storks and egrets are usually found prowling the rice fields looking for these small shrimp.

<text>Josef Spudich (November 9, 1908 – March 10, 2001) was a United States professional American football player and teacher.

He was born one of nine children of parents who came to the United States in 1903 from Croatia.
In order to help with family expenses, Spudich worked nights and summers in a coal mine while attending high school in Benld, Illinois, and was graduated in 1929. He was a graduate of McKendree College, Lebanon, Illinois, in 1933, where he was named to the United Press International All-Star Football Team in 1932, and was All State fullback in 1931 and 1932. Moreover, he played professional football for the St. Louis Gunners, the Tulsa Oilers, and the Chicago Cardinals.

Spudich earned his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Missouri and did post-graduate work at Oxford in England and at Columbia University.

He taught and coached in Sikeston, Missouri, Cairo and El Dorado Springs; then starting in 1942, at Freeport High School, Freeport, Illinois, where he was head football coach from 1951–1954.

Spudich taught English and served as assistant principal. He was
a soft-spoken man and had the respect and admiration of his students. Mr. Spudich always had time to help students, even if it was at the expense of his own plans. He was a very patient and kind man. He was also not only considered the High School&#x27;s strongest man, his arms filling out his suit jackets, but was also considered the best dressed male teacher. Joe, as he was known to his students, would also plan field trips, such as taking them to Chicago to see such plays as &quot;Camelot&quot;, starring Richard Burton. He also assigned then contemporary books such as Patterns, by Rod Serling, as well as classics, such as Shakespeare&#x27;s, &quot;Julius Caesar.&quot; After retiring at Freeport High School in 1964, he taught English and was chairman of the Humanities Division at Highland College, also in Freeport, Illinois.

Mr. Spudich served on the Freeport Library Board, was a Freeport City Alderman, coached the Frogs Girls Softball Team, played slow pitch softball in his 1970s, helped move a log cabin to the Stephenson County Historical Society grounds in Freeport, and did all the stonework on his own house plus a lot of stonework for others. If Joe knew that his stonework for some people was unaffordable, he did it free of cost.

<doc id="1208974" wikidata="Q1140962" url="?curid=1208974" title="Crook, County Durham">
<text>Crook is a market town in the Durham County Council unitary authority and ceremonial county of County Durham, England. It is located on the edge of Weardale and sometimes referred to as the &quot;Gateway to Weardale&quot;.

Crook lies about south-west of the historic city of Durham, north-west of Bishop Auckland and from Willington. The A689 road from Durham leads up through Wolsingham and Stanhope into the upper reaches of Weardale. Until 1974, the town was in Crook and Willington Urban District and had a parish council.

==History==
Crook first appeared as an agricultural village around 1795 although its surrounding districts; Billy Row, Stanley, White Lea and Helmington Row, were established much earlier. In these days Crook was predominantly farmland; however, it also had an Inn and a blacksmith shop, consequently the primary field of employment was within the agricultural industry. 40 years later; Crook became a mining village, and thrived as the coal was very close to the surface and soon there were over 20 mines around the Crook area. By the end of the nineteenth century the town had developed rapidly, in population and economy. However, the local population declined in the following century, as the coal mines and industries closed. With at one point over 34% of the population being unemployed.

Crook&#x27;s football team, Crook Town F.C., have won the FA Amateur Cup five times, most recently beating Enfield F.C. in 1964, before the cup was abolished in 1974. This record is second only to Crook&#x27;s near neighbours, Bishop Auckland F.C. The club have also reached the third round of the FA Cup and formed a key role in the development of FC Barcelona, playing a number of friendly matches in the 1910s and 1920s.

== Landmarks ==
=== War memorial ===
There is a World War I and World War II war memorial in Crook&#x27;s town centre.

Grade 2 listed St Andrew&#x27;s Church is an LEP between URC and Methodist Churches. On top of the hills to the east sits Crook Golf Club.

<text>OceanLab (or Above &amp; Beyond presents OceanLab) is a vocal trance group formed in 2000 in London. The group consists of vocalist Justine Suissa and the three members of Above &amp; Beyond: Jono Grant, Paavo Siljamäki, and Tony McGuinness. 

==History==

=== 2000s ===

The group&#x27;s first single, released in 2001, was &quot;Clear Blue Water&quot;, which was remixed by several artists, including Ferry Corsten. The track peaked at #48 in the UK Singles Chart in April 2002. The second single, &quot;Sky Falls Down&quot;, was released in 2002 and remixed by Armin van Buuren. The third single, &quot;Beautiful Together&quot;, was released in 2003 and was remixed by Seraque, Silvester, and Signum. Their fourth single, considered to be their breakthrough, was &quot;Satellite&quot;, which was playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and reached #19 in the UK charts in May 2004. The track remains the highest-charting single by OceanLab or Above &amp; Beyond.

On 7 April 2008, the single &quot;Sirens of the Sea&quot; was released, including remixes by Sonorous, Cosmic Gate, Maor Levi, and Kyau &amp; Albert.

On 10 June 2008, OceanLab&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Sirens of the Sea&quot;, was announced on the Anjunabeats website with a release date of 21 July 2008. The single &quot;Miracle&quot; appeared a week earlier, on 14 July 2008. Included on the single are Above and Beyond&#x27;s Club Mix of tracks, as well as remixes by Martin Roth, Michael Cassette, and Fletch. The &quot;Sirens of the Sea Remixed&quot; album, released in 2009, includes the most successful remixes of OceanLab singles &quot;Satellite&quot;, &quot;Sky Falls Down&quot;, and &quot;Clear Blue Water&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
On 30 January 2014 McGuinness and Siljamäki confirmed via Reddit that the artist name OceanLab would no longer be used on future productions, with Justine Suissa now being identified as a part of Above &amp; Beyond.

After a full-year hiatus, the group announced their return with a new single at Above &amp; Beyond&#x27;s ABGT150 concert in September 2015. On 26 September 2015, however, Above &amp; Beyond featured a new surprise OceanLab production at ABGT150 in Sydney, titled &quot;Another Chance&quot;. It was released as a single containing the original mix and the Above &amp; Beyond Club Mix on 4 November 2016. 

On 24 September 2016 Above &amp; Beyond featured a new OceanLab production at ABGT200 in the Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam. The title of this new single is &quot;Alright Now.&quot; The Above &amp; Beyond Club Mix of the track was originally released on Anjunabeats Volume 13, but was released as a standalone single on 12 May 2017. It was released on Above &amp; Beyond&#x27;s 2018 album, &quot;Common Ground&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
Justine with Above &amp; Beyond have collaborated to release a &quot;Almost Home&quot; track in 2021. It was the first collab after a 4-year period of falling out. 

In 2023, a limited edition music set (featuring Seven Lions, with remixes of greatest hits), to commemorate a second decade of their existence, was released.

<text>Norman Weiss was an executive at General Artists Corp., a talent agency, which booked some of the biggest musical groups in the 1960s, including The Beatles for their first tour of America, including their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.

Weiss had started a theatrical agency, with partner Roy Gerber, in New York City in the post-World War II 1940s. The pair sold their agency to Music Corporation of America (MCA) in 1953, joining that firm as agents. In the early 1960s, the pair moved to General Artists Corp., where Weiss worked with Brian Epstein, The Beatles&#x27; manager, to arranging the band&#x27;s first American tour, which included The Beatles famous appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Other pop music personalities of the 1960s represented by Weiss included The Turtles (in which Weiss&#x27;s agency is noted as &quot;a despicable record company that sued them for millions of dollars&#x27;) and Tom Jones, where his influence on Jones&#x27;s success in America is generally ignored entirely. Nevertheless, Weiss was a force in popular music in the 1960s while at General Artists Corp, although his influence is not generally well understood by the public, it is still remembered by industry insiders, even today.

<text>The following is an incomplete list of Linux audio software.

== Audio players ==
=== GStreamer-based ===
* Amarok is a free music player for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Multiple backends are supported (xine, helix and NMM).
* Banshee is a free audio player for Linux which uses the GStreamer multimedia platforms to play, encode, and decode Ogg Vorbis, MP3, and other formats. Banshee supports playing and importing audio CDs and playing and synchronizing music with iPods. Audioscrobbler API support.
* Clementine is a cross-platform, open-source, Qt based audio player, written in C++. It can play Internet radio streams; managing some media devices, playlists; supports visualizations, Audioscrobbler API. It was made as a spin-off of Amarok 1.4 and is a rougher version of said program.
* Exaile is a free software audio player for Unix-like operating systems that aims to be functionally similar to KDE’s Amarok. Unlike Amarok, Exaile is a Python program and uses the GTK toolkit.
* Guayadeque Music Player is a free and open-source audio player written in C++ using the wxWidgets toolkit.
* Muine is an audio player for the GNOME desktop environment. Muine is written in C# using Mono and Gtk#. The default backend is GStreamer framework but Muine can also use xine libraries.
* Quod Libet is a GTK based audio player, written in Python, using GStreamer or Xine as back ends. Its distinguishing features are a rigorous approach to tagging (making it especially popular with classical music fans) and a flexible approach to music library management. It supports regular expression and Boolean algebra-based searches, and is stated to perform efficiently with music libraries of tens of thousands of tracks.
* Rhythmbox is an audio player inspired by Apple iTunes.
* Songbird is a cross-platform, open-source media player and web browser. It is built using code from the Firefox web browser. The graphical user interface (GUI) is very similar to Apple iTunes, and it can sync with Apple iPods. Like Firefox, Songbird is extensible via downloadable add-ons. It&#x27;s able to display lyrics retrieved from the net, and also the ones embedded through metadata (ID3v2 tag) after adding the LyricMaster plug-in. Linux official support for Songbird was discontinued in April, 2010. But in December, 2011 a group of programmers forked it openly as Nightingale.

=== Music Player Daemon based ===
* Cantata is a Qt-based front-end for Music Player Daemon.
* Ario is a light GTK2 client to MPD

=== Other ===
* Audacious is a free media player for Linux or Linux-based systems. It can be expanded via plug-ins, including support for all popular codecs. On most systems a useful set of plug-ins is installed by default, supporting MP3, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC files. Audacious&#x27; classic interface looks and feels very similar to Winamp. It is compatible with LADSPA plug-ins.
* cmus is a small and fast text-mode music player for Linux and many other Unix-like operating systems.
* DeaDBeeF (as in 0xDEADBEEF) is a modular audio player for Linux, *BSD, OpenSolaris, macOS, and other UNIX-like systems.
* JuK is a free software audio player for KDE, the default player since KDE 3.2. JuK supports collections of MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC audio files.
* mpg123 is a real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player/decoder for layers 1, 2 and 3 (MPEG 1.0 layer 3 a.k.a. MP3 most commonly tested). Among others working with Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, SunOS4.1.3, Solaris 2.5, HPUX 9.x, SGI Irix and Cygwin or plain Windows. It is free software licensed under LGPL 2.1
* Music on Console (MOC) is an ncurses-based console audio player. It is designed to be powerful and easy to use, and its command structure and window layouts are similar to the Midnight Commander console file manager. It is very configurable, with Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), Open Sound System (OSS) or JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK) outputs, customizable color schemes, interface layouts, key bindings, and tag parsing.
* Sound eXchange (SoX) is a cross-platform command-line audio editor.
* X MultiMedia System (XMMS) is a GTK1-based multimedia player which works on many platforms, but has some features which only work under Linux. XMMS can play media files such as .ogg, MP3, MOD&#x27;s, WAV and others with the use of input plug-ins. It is a free software audio player similar to Winamp that runs on many Unix-like operating systems. However, development of XMMS has been deprecated in favor of XMMS2, a new audio player built from scratch on the more modern GTK2 libraries. See also Audacious on this page as a successor to the historic XMMS.
* Tomahawk is a cross-platform music player built with social media and multi-source music streaming in mind. It features support for services like Spotify, Grooveshark, Dilandau, SoundCloud, 4shared, Jamendo, Last.fm, Ampache, Owncloud, Ex.fm and Subsonic.

<doc id="1208981" wikidata="Q7207378" url="?curid=1208981" title="Poems of Black Africa">
<text>Poems of Black Africa is a poetry anthology edited by Wole Soyinka, published in 1975 as part of the Heinemann &quot;African Writers Series&quot;. It was arranged by theme.

== Introduction ==

Soyinka introduces &quot;Poems of Black Africa&quot; as being different from other anthologies because it is arranged by themes that go beyond what Soyinka calls the &quot;customary settings&quot; of other ways of organizing such as &quot;regions, period, style, [and] authorship.&quot; He states that the purpose of this anthology was to put together poems that envelop the reality and sense of black Africa, both &quot;modern and historic&quot;, through poetic expression.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Poems of Black Africa&quot; was well received by Ursula A. Barnett, who declared it a successful anthology, although acknowledging that the work focuses on quality rather than comprehensiveness, despite being described as encompassing &quot;most of the experience of the African world&quot;. She notes in her review in &quot;World Literature Today&quot; that many of the poems included were written by African statesmen. According to Barnett the works vary from expressions of passion, pain, beauty, betrayal, nostalgia, revolutionary fervour, death, wit, humour and satire. The works represent traditional writings from a wide array of groups, encompassing the Swahili, Yoruba, Zulu and other sources, and including seven original poems from Soyinka himself.

Michael Kelly of the University of Hull, Northumberside, criticizes the works in &quot;Poems of Black Africa&quot; for being not poetic in the way they treat themes of race, identity, and suffering, calling the poems &quot;propagandist and rhetorical&quot;. In contrast to Barnett&#x27;s review, Kelly notes a lack of quality writing throughout the selections; he calls the poems difficult to understand and says that they are full of overwriting and lack clarity, placing responsibility for this fault on the anthology and on Soyinka himself as editor. Kelly says that genuine feeling expressed in the poems is not enough to overcome the lack of structure and form. Ending his critique, he states that black poets would have been better served by an anthology that focused on quality rather than themes, calling &quot;Poems of Black Africa&quot; &quot;provocative and embarrassing&quot;.

<doc id="1208983" wikidata="Q3556413" url="?curid=1208983" title="Veterans of Foreign Wars">
<text>The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), formally the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, is an organization of United States war veterans who fought in wars, campaigns, and expeditions on foreign land, waters, or airspace as military service members. Established on September 29, 1899, in Columbus, Ohio, the VFW is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. It was federally chartered in 1936.

== History ==

The VFW resulted from the amalgamation of several societies formed immediately following the Spanish–American War. In 1899, little groups of veterans returning from campaigning in Cuba and the Philippine Islands, founded local societies upon a spirit of comradeship known only to those who faced the dangers of that war side by side. Similar experiences and a common language drew them together. The American Veterans of Foreign Service (predecessor to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States) was established in Columbus, Ohio, September 29, 1899, by Spanish‑American War veteran James C. Putnam. The Colorado Society, Army of the Philippines, was organized in Denver, Colorado, on December 12, 1899, by General Irving Hale of Denver, Colorado. Shortly thereafter, a society known as the Foreign Service Veterans was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in October 1901. The Ohio-based group and the Pittsburgh-based group held a joint convention in 1905, where the two groups merged. Merging the final two groups was talked about as early as 1908 but was not accomplished until 1913. In August 1913 an encampment was held in Denver and they merged their interests and identities in a national organization now known as the VFW.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the VFW is to speed rehabilitation of the nation&#x27;s disabled and needy veterans, assist veterans&#x27; widows and orphans and the dependents of needy or disabled veterans, and promote Americanism by means of education in patriotism and by constructive service to local communities. The organization maintains both its legislative service and central office of its national rehabilitation service in Washington, D.C. The latter nationwide program serves disabled veterans of all wars, members and nonmembers alike, in matters of government compensation and pension claims, hospitalization, civil-service employment preference, etc.&quot;

== Logo ==
Redesigned in November 2018, the official logo of the VFW includes an artistic representation of service stripes, easily recognizable insignia indicative of military service. Worn on most service uniforms, they denote length of service. As such, the first and leaner of the two service stripes represents the VFW&#x27;s entry into its second century of service to America&#x27;s veterans, service members and their families. The second, broader stripe represents its first century of service, spanning back to 1899.

== Great Seal ==
The Cross of Malta is the VFW&#x27;s official emblem. The cross, radiating rays, and Great Seal of the United States together symbolize the character, vows and purposes distinguishing VFW as an order of warriors who have traveled far from home to defend sacred principles. Its eight points represent the beatitudes prescribed in the Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are the poor in spirit, the meek, the pure, the merciful, the peacemakers; blessed are they who mourn, seek righteousness and are persecuted for righteousness&#x27; sake. The eight-pointed Cross of Malta harks back to the Crusades, launched during the 12th century.

== Eligibility ==
Membership in the VFW is restricted to any active or honorably discharged officer or enlisted person who is a citizen of the United States and who has served in its armed forces &quot;in any foreign war, insurrection or expedition, which service shall be recognized by the authorization or the issuance of a United States military campaign medal.&quot;

The following is a list of U.S. campaign medals, ribbons, and badges used by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States to determine membership eligibility.

===Refusal to admit WWII Japanese American veterans===
Despite their distinguished record, many posts and departments refused Japanese-American veterans entry into the VFW. In Chicago, white officers from the 442nd RCT advocated for a group&#x27;s charter to form a segregated American Legion post in 1946. In Sacramento, California, another group found Alva Fleming, a sympathetic member in VFW district leadership who approved the charter of Nisei VFW Post 8985 on 7 February 1947. Fleming would go on to become State Commander for the Department of California, and considered to be the driving force in the founding of a total of 14 Nisei VFW posts throughout California, posts 8985 in Sacramento, Monterey post 1629, Gardena post 1961, Garden Grove post 3670, San Fernando post 4140, San Diego post 4851, Hanford post 5869, Oceanside post 6945, Fresno post 8499, Watsonville post 9446, San Francisco post 9879, East Los Angeles post 9902, Los Angeles post 9938, and San Jose post 9970, all still active today. Nisei veterans in the Pacific Northwest were not so lucky, unable to find anyone willing to do the same there despite letters of support from Colonel Virgil R. Miller and General Lucian Truscott. Although VFW national commanders Jean Brunner and Joseph Stack condemned the actions of local posts, their bylaws at the time promoted autonomy in individual posts and were powerless to prevent the discrimination. They could only offer them membership as members-at-large. Unwilling to be treated as a second class members, the PNW Nisei decided to form their own independent veterans organization when neither the VFW or the American Legion would accept them as members nor grant them charters for a segregated post.

===Vietnam veterans membership controversy===
The VFW initially refused membership for Vietnam War veterans. At the time, most incumbent VFW members were World War II and Korean War veterans. Many of these WWII veterans were of the opinion that the conflict in Vietnam was a &quot;police action&quot; and in their minds did not qualify as a war, despite the Korean War also being a &quot;police action&quot; with no formal declaration of war. This rationale was used to deny membership to many Vietnam War veterans across the country. Many of these WWII veterans blamed Vietnam War veterans for losing the war. In the years since, many veterans of the Vietnam War have refused to join the VFW due to this, and many older posts now find themselves struggling to survive as WWII and Korea vets have either died or are no longer active, and younger Iraq and Afghanistan veterans do not feel comfortable joining a dying post.

==Membership and structure==
 the VFW has 1.6 million members and Auxiliary members, forming 6,000 local chapters known as Posts, grouped into 52 Departments covering the 50 states, the Asia-Pacific area, and Europe.

== Support and assistance programs ==
The VFW offers a wide range of assistance programs aimed at helping veterans of every generation. This includes providing free, professional help filing or appealing a VA claim, offering scholarships for post-secondary education or providing emergency financial relief.

=== VA claims and separation assistance ===
The VFW&#x27;s National Veterans Service program consists of a nationwide network of VA accredited service officers and pre-discharge representatives who are experts in dealing with the VA and are the key to your success. The VA reports veterans represented by the VFW have recouped $8.3 billion in earned benefits, including $1.4 billion in new claims in 2018 alone.

=== Pre-discharge ===
With offices located on or near major military installations across the country, VFW Pre-Discharge representatives guide military personnel through the veterans claims process and conduct physical examinations prior to their separation from active duty. They are also ready to answer questions about education and medical benefits, as well as VA home loans.

== Student veteran support ==
=== Help A Hero Scholarship ===
Established in 2014, the VFW&#x27;s Help A Hero Scholarship provides service members and veterans with financial assistance they need to complete their educational goals without incurring excessive U.S. student loan debt.  

=== 1 Student Veteran ===
To help ensure student veterans receive their benefits in a timely manner and have a place to turn to if they need help, the VFW, in conjunction with the Student Veterans of America (SVA), have developed the 1 Student Veteran program. 1 Student Veteran offers direct assistance to student veterans who have questions or are experiencing problems accessing their VA benefits.

=== VFW-SVA Legislative Fellowship ===
The VFW-SVA Legislative Fellowship grants ten exemplary student veterans (fellows) the chance to join the VFW legislative team on Capitol Hill during the VFW Legislative Conference. The fellows will walk the halls of Congress, educating their legislators on the issues facing today&#x27;s student veterans and have the opportunity to meet with policy-makers from federal agencies responsible for implementing veterans&#x27; policy.

== Veterans and Military Support Programs ==
The VFW&#x27;s Veterans &amp; Military Support Programs is the umbrella for three successful, long-standing programs; Operation Uplink, Unmet Needs, and the Military Assistance Program (MAP). These initiatives focus on troop support.

=== Military Assistance Program ===
MAP is the link between the VFW and the community. MAP is designed to promote VFW interaction within the local military community through the &quot;Adopt-A-Unit&quot; Program. &quot;MAP Grants&quot; are available to posts, districts, and departments who participate in a variety of morale boosting functions such as farewell and welcome home events.

=== Operation Uplink ===
Operation Uplink keeps military members in contact with their loved ones by allowing deployed troops to call home at no charge from MWR internet cafés in Afghanistan, Kuwait and other locations all around the world. Operation Uplink also distributes &quot;virtual pins&quot; which enable wounded warriors and veterans in Veterans Affairs facilities to call from home at no cost.

=== Unmet Needs ===
Unmet Needs assists military service members and their families who run into unexpected financial difficulties as a result of deployment or other hardships directly related to military service. Assistance is in the form of a grant of up to . Unmet Needs assists with basic life needs such as: mortgage and rent, home and auto repairs, insurance, utilities, food and clothing.

=== Community service ===
The VFW host events across America, as well as giving grants and helping at large-scale volunteer events.

<doc id="1208985" wikidata="Q6399289" url="?curid=1208985" title="Khaled (album)">
<text>Khaled, released in 1992, is Khaled&#x27;s self-titled debut solo studio album for a major music label. The album was produced by Michael Brook and Don Was.

The album was primarily sung in Khaled&#x27;s native Algerian Arabic dialect with the exception of &quot;Ne m&#x27;en voulez pas&quot;, which was sung in French. According to some estimates, the album sold over 7 million copies and became the biggest selling Arabic album.

==Production==

Khaled signed with French record label Barclay Records, then brought in American record producer Don Was to &quot;incorporate American R&amp;B—to Americanize the music&quot;, which Don Was achieved by combining Khaled&#x27;s live musicians with loops and beats from his Macintosh computer and a keyboard. The result of these sessions in the studio that combined Khaled&#x27;s rai with Was&#x27; R&amp;B, was, according to Was, &quot;pretty wild music.&quot;

==Reception==
The response from the Arab public was mixed. Many of the more conservative Arabs stopped buying his records and going to his concerts, feeling offended by exposure to what they perceived as the liberal West, and by what they saw as &quot;(selling) out to Western commercialism&quot;. Others saw this as new, cool, and revolutionary, and he attracted a new audience.

The music from the album, especially &quot;Didi,&quot; was played in French nightclubs and on Hip Hip Hourah, and the album began to sell well throughout France. The French emcee Abdelmalek Sultan of hip-hop band IAM called Khaled the &quot;Public Enemy Arabe&quot; and is regarded as the first &quot;raï&quot; artist to successfully cross over into the French pop market.

<doc id="1208993" wikidata="Q2269583" url="?curid=1208993" title="Sen-Sen">
<text>Sen-Sen was a type of breath freshener originally marketed as a &quot;breath perfume&quot; in the late 19th century by the T. B. Dunn Company and then produced by F&amp;F Foods until they discontinued the product in July 2013. Sen-Sen bore a strong similarity to Vigroids, a liquorice sweet made by Ernest Jackson &amp; Company, Ltd.

Sen-Sens were available in small packets or cardboard boxes. Similar to a matchbox of the time, an inner box slid out from a cardboard sleeve revealing a small hole from which the tiny Sen-Sen squares would fall when the box was shaken.

Sen-Sen&#x27;s ingredients were liquorice, anise, gum arabic, maltodextrin, sugar, and natural and artificial flavors.
