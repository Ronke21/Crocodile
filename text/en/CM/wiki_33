<text>Doctor Anthony Druid, also known as Doctor Droom and Druid, is a fictional mystic and a supernatural monster-hunter appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer-editor Stan Lee and penciller Jack Kirby, he debuted as Dr. Anthony Droom in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #1, published in March 1961 (with a cover date of June 1961). Kirby&#x27;s art was inked by artist Steve Ditko. Dr. Droom appeared in four more issues of &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; before his stories discontinued. Over a year later, artist Steve Ditko approached Stan Lee with a new magic character called Mr. Strange. Liking the idea, Stan Lee renamed the character Dr. Strange and wrote an origin story similar to Dr. Droom&#x27;s. Dr. Anthony Droom was finally reintroduced to comics in 1976 in &quot;Weird Wonder Tales&quot; #19 in a retelling of his origin story which renamed him Dr. Anthony Druid. This retelling included new writing by Larry Lieber (brother of Stan Lee).

Through his knowledge, Dr. Druid has enhanced physical and mental abilities (such as hypnosis and the ability to sense magic) and knows how to counteract magic and protect against it (through rituals and special arrangement of symbols). According to the lore of Marvel Comics, this makes Dr. Druid a mystic but not a full sorcerer like Dr. Strange since he does not cast spells that alter the state of people or the environment around him and does not draw power from Earth&#x27;s magical energy, extra-dimensional energy, or energy linked to magical entities.

Considered a scholar of multiple fields, the brilliant Dr. Anthony Druid is originally a psychiatrist who then becomes an author and physician. After Dr. Druid undergoes a series of tests in Tibet, a dying lama and mystic mentally transmits to his mind secrets of how to enhance his own body and mind&#x27;s power and control, as well as knowledge regarding magic and supernatural threats. Later it is said Dr. Druid also taps into the knowledge of Celtic ancestors regarding magic. With the combined knowledge of both his Celtic ancestors and the Tibetan lama, Dr. Druid acts as a magic-based consultant and hero of Earth. Over the years, he has worked with the superhero team known as the Avengers, and it is later said he was part of a group known as the Monster Hunters. On multiple occasions, he has worked with the sorcerer Dr. Strange.

==Publication history==
Originally introduced as Dr. Anthony Droom, the character debuted in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #1 in June 1961. The origin story was written by Stan Lee, penciled by Jack Kirby, and inked by Steve Ditko. In the story, Anthony Droom is referred to as a psychiatrist, scholar, and physician and is independently wealthy. After undergoing a series of tests in Tibet, he is chosen by a dying lama to protect humanity from threats. In this version of the character&#x27;s origin, he is imparted with all of the lama&#x27;s knowledge and then is also transformed by magic from his Caucasian appearance to now having the appearance of Asian heritage. He is told that his appearance suits his new knowledge and role. In the subsequent stories of &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;, Droom continues to have an Asian appearance and is given a yellow skin tone.

After his origin in issue #1, Dr. Droom starred in stories in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #2–4 and #6 (1961). Dr. Droom did not appear in the series again afterward, which was retitled as &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot; starting with issue #7 (the same series that with its final issue, &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15, would introduced Stan Lee and Steve Ditko&#x27;s creation &quot;Spider-Man&quot;).

According to Lee, the idea of Doctor Droom was essentially succeeded by Doctor Strange: &quot;... I always liked [Doctor Droom], but I forgot about him. It was a one-shot thing. And one day while we were trying to think of some new heroes, I thought I&#x27;d like to bring back a magician&quot;. Lee later clarified that the inciting incident to bring forth a magical character similar to Dr. Droom came when Steve Ditko brought him artwork for a character he called Mr. Strange. Stan Lee changed the name to Dr. Strange and gave the character a new version of Dr. Droom&#x27;s origin, making Stephen Strange a physician who loses the use of his hands and then seeks out help from a sorcerer in the Himalayas for help, only to then become the man&#x27;s student and return to New York as a sorcerer himself.

In 1976, Marvel editor Roger Stern thought to bring Doctor Droom back for issue #19 of &quot;Weird Wonder Tales&quot;, a series that reprinted previously published Marvel Comics stories, sometimes with new art. Issue #19 reprinted Dr. Droom&#x27;s origin story but with some altered and added dialogue by Larry Lieber and with the protagonist now called Doctor Anthony Druid, new name conceived by Len Wein, presumably to avoid confusion with Marvel supervillain Doctor Doom. Dr. Druid sported a red outfit in his role as hero and the new version of his origin story removed the idea that the appearance of his racial heritage is altered by magic. Droom&#x27;s second story was then reprinted in &quot;Weird Wonder Tales&quot; #20, again with new art work and with his name changed to Dr. Druid. The character then appeared in issues #21-22, but only as a host introducing fantasy stories to the reader. &quot;Weird Wonder Tales&quot; then ended with issue #23, which contained a reprint of another Droom story from &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;. The story was introduced by a new splash page drawn by artist John Byrne. In the story, Droom&#x27;s drab grey clothing was painted over with Druid&#x27;s new red uniform.

Dr. Druid appeared next in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #210-211 by writer Len Wein, and &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 2) #26 by writer Jim Shooter. During Roger Stern&#x27;s work as writer of &quot;Avengers&quot; in the 1980s, Dr. Druid frequently appeared as an associate of the team.

Dr. Druid appeared in the miniseries &quot;Druid&quot; #1–4 (May–Aug. 1995) by writer Warren Ellis and artist Leonardo Manco. In &quot;Marvel Universe&quot; #4–7 (Sept.–Dec. 1998), his backstory was expanded and retconned, now revealing he had been a member of the Monster Hunters, whose adventures took place between the &quot;Age of Monsters&quot; and the &quot;Age of Heroes&quot; (the latter era beginning when the Fantastic Four gain their powers and are soon followed by a wave of new public superheroes). Dr. Druid appeared as a Monster Hunter again in issue #2 of &quot;&quot;.

Doctor Druid was one of the featured characters in the 2011 three-issue limited series &quot;Chaos War: Dead Avengers&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

Doctor Druid&#x27;s real name is Dr. Anthony Ludgate Druid, although he usually refers to himself as Dr. Anthony Druid. He is a psychiatrist and explorer as well as a minor telepath and magician, specializing mostly in hypnosis and other feats of mesmerism. He has minor magical abilities that have varied over the years. He is also an expert on the occult, having been trained by a Tibetan lama who had come to the U.S. for medical attention. Many years later, Druid discovered that the lama was, in fact, the Ancient One who selected Anthony Druid as a back-up in case his grooming of Doctor Strange failed.

Doctor Druid remained on the sidelines for years. He eventually appeared again and teamed with the Hulk against the Maha Yogi. With the Avengers, he encountered the Fomor and his ancestor Amergin.

Doctor Druid sometime later aided the Avengers in thwarting Baron Helmut Zemo and the fourth Masters of Evil&#x27;s takeover of Avengers Mansion, making contact with the mentally damaged Blackout and helping him resist Zemo&#x27;s control while also prompting him to bring Avengers Mansion back to Earth after banishing it into his Darkforce Dimension. He joined the ranks of the Avengers shortly after helping to defend from this attack. He battled a Dracula doppelganger in the realm of Death.

His membership was tainted when he was mind-controlled by supervillainess the Terminatrix (at the time impersonating the space pirate Nebula) into manipulating the team on her behalf. While in this state, he even assumed chairmanship of the team for a very short period. When &quot;Nebula&quot; was cast into Limbo, Druid followed, as he was still under her thrall. He eventually regained control of his own mind and returned to Earth, where, after learning his true origin, he banished &quot;Nebula&quot; and became younger by magic.

Due to his actions while in the villain&#x27;s thrall, Druid was disgraced. He was briefly reunited with his former teammates while working with Doctor Strange during the Infinity War, and later became the leader of the Secret Defenders. In that role, he was once again victimized by a villain&#x27;s mind control, this time by the demon Slorioth. Doctor Druid and the demon were defeated, Druid faked his own death, and the team disbanded.

He then abandoned his spandex costume and became even more of a real, traditional druid, a fact reflected by his taking on the simple name of &quot;Druid&quot; and the new nature of his nature powers, but he let his feelings of rage and power lust take him over, went insane, was betrayed by his allies, and was finally killed by Hellstorm, the putative Son of Satan. Druid&#x27;s ghost appeared later alongside the spirits of other dead ex-Avengers, confirming that Druid had, in fact, died this time. The Avengers later placed a memorial statue of him in the garden of Avengers Mansion.

A mere 36 hours before his death, Druid is visited by a time-traveling Black Widow. He happily assisted her with magical research pertaining to her mission, no wiser about his imminent demise.

Doctor Druid&#x27;s son is introduced as one of Nick Fury&#x27;s new recruits to fight against the Secret Invasion. &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; #4 reveals that he is operating under the name of Druid.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Doctor Druid is among the dead heroes brought back to life when Amatsu-Mikaboshi dominated the death realms.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Doctor Druid resurfaced on Weirdworld. Nighthawk of Earth-31916, Blur of Earth-148611 and Tyndall were captured by Doctor Druid&#x27;s minions and taken to his castle. He revealed to his captives that his soul took on a corporeal form when it found Weirdworld, where he remained so that he can still be alive. Doctor Druid also revealed that Ogeode built him a massive crystal on top of his castle to amplify his mind-control abilities, which brought anyone in his part of Weirdworld under his thrall. For some reason, Thundra and Tyndall were immune to his effects due to something related to time travel.

He later resurfaces on Earth and attempts to live a normal life, but does help Dr. Strange with a magical investigation.

During the &quot;Stark-Roxxon War&quot; arc, Doctor Druid was at A.I.M.&#x27;s facility in Caspen, Colorado at the time when A.I.M. and Roxxon Energy Corporation were planning a merger with Stark Unlimited. As a scienceless act on Monica&#x27;s orders, Doctor Druid subjected Iron Man to illusions where Howard Stark, Captain America, and Emma Frost called Iron Man a failure. Doctor Druid accompanied Monica Rappaccini to the meeting with Stark Unlimited&#x27;s Board of Directors where only Iron Man and Melinda May opposed the merger. When Justine Hammer&#x27;s Iron Monger form starts to best Iron Man, Doctor Druid breaks up the fight and takes them and the board members to meet A.I.M. and Roxxon&#x27;s silent partner who turns out to be Belasco as they meet with him in Limbo. It is also revealed that Doctor Druid is enthralled to Belasco who is wanting to claim the souls of the board members. Thanks to a withdrawal of votes from the board members, Belasco&#x27;s plans to control the companies fell through. After transporting Tony Stark and Justine Hammer back to Stark Tower, Doctor Druid offers to help Iron Man at a later point. Tony Stark tells Doctor Druid to teleport the board members back to their homes. Doctor Druid leaves to do that.

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Druid&#x27;s latent mystical abilities were activated by the Ancient One. He has a variety of psionic abilities including telepathy which enables him to scan or project his thoughts to any mind on Earth, the ability to mesmerize minds less adept than his own, and the ability to perform mass hypnosis. Doctor Druid&#x27;s hypnotic abilities enable him to achieve numerous illusory effects, including invisibility, altering the appearance of himself and others, and the projection of illusionary objects or beings. He has psychokinetic powers enabling him to levitate himself or other people and objects. Doctor Druid has limited precognitive abilities and can sense the presence of recent uses of magic and trace them to their sources.

Doctor Druid&#x27;s druidic powers have a special vulnerability to iron, as did the powers of his ancestors. Iron tends to act as a lightning rod for the magical forces he employs, sometimes disrupting their effects.

Doctor Druid employs the mystical knowledge and skills of the ancient druids. Through magic rituals that may involve chants, runes, candles, potions, mystic symbols, and other such preparations, Doctor Druid can achieve various magical feats. These rituals tap the inherent mystical energies in natural objects and materials. Doctor Druid possesses various Celtic mystical artifacts as well. At one time, Druid even had access to the Moebius Stone, which was a mystic item created by Agamotto that had a limited ability to manipulate time. The stone was able to raise the dead, absorb the life-force of another, and accelerate or reverse the passage of time within a confined area, though sometimes random time-related side effects occurred. Doctor Druid eventually destroyed the artifact because he felt it was too powerful to fall into the wrong hands. Doctor Druid can also call upon the Celtic war goddesses Morrigan, Macha, and Badb for mystical assistance. Doctor Druid also possesses various yogic abilities, including control over involuntary functions of his body such as his heartbeat, respiration, bleeding, and reaction to pain.

In his latest and final incarnation, when he was called only &quot;Druid&quot;, he has been seen manipulating fire, and making a tree instantaneously grow in a person&#x27;s stomach from the seeds of an eaten apple. These powers were nature-based (elements, plants, etc.) as the druids of old worshipped nature.

Druid has earned an M.D. from Harvard, completed a residency in psychiatry, and has extensive knowledge of occult lore, especially Celtic lore.

==Other versions==
===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In an alternate future, detailed in the &quot;Killraven&quot; series, Martians had come to Earth and wiped out much of humanity.

He also works to make sure the Martian battle is recorded in the Book of Kells.

===Marvel Apes===
An alternate universe version of Doctor Druid appears in the 2008 miniseries &quot;Marvel Apes&quot; #2–4 (Nov.–Dec. 2008). Druid plays a key role in issue #3 (Dec. 2008) in which he uses his staff, the Monkey&#x27;s Paw, to control the realm created by Doctor Strange.

===Marvel Zombies===
An alternate universe version of Doctor Druid appears in the 2007 miniseries &quot;Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness&quot;. Infected with the zombie virus, he visits Doctor Strange seeking help to stop from turning. With Strange having left to join the resistance, a ravenous Druid reluctantly consumes Strange&#x27;s assistant, Wong. Despite pleading for mercy and understanding from Ash Williams, Dazzler, and the Scarlet Witch, Ash surprises Druid and blows his head off with his shotgun.

===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, a variation of Doctor Druid appears in the Battleworld domain of Technopolis. He acts as a forensics scientist at the city morgue and helps Grand Marshall Rhodes investigate the murder of Spyder-Man (the superhero alias of Ben Urich&#x27;s nephew Peter Urich).

==Reception==

&quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked Doctor Druid as the fourth worst Avengers member describing him as &quot;most notably responsible for becoming the leader of the Avengers only to betray them after being mocked by Daimon Hellstrom, presumably for looking like Rip Torn in a cloak&quot;. &quot;The Slings and Arrows Comic Guide&quot; found him to be &quot;always a third-stringer&quot;, and when he received his own miniseries, it was found to be a &quot;total yawner&quot;.

<text>A chess table is a table built with features to make it useful for playing the game of chess. They can come in various sizes and shapes, and are usually made of solid wood. They can be found in some cities and other public areas. Most are of a similar size to a picnic table.

==Description==
A chess table is a table built with features to make it useful for playing the game of chess. A chess board is usually integral to the table top and often two drawers are provided to hold the pieces when not in use. Most chess tables have the board inlaid or engraved, though cheaper tables may have it painted on. Chess tables can be extremely decorative, well made and potentially expensive pieces of furniture. A chess table is not necessary to play chess and is not restricted only to playing chess. 

==Materials==
Chess tables are typically made of solid wood, with rosewood, cedar, and mahogany being the most popular. Exotic wood versions are also available.

==Location==
Many cities and universities have chess tables in their parks and gardens. Many coffeehouses also have chess tables. Most are the size of a normal picnic table, although some are larger than life sets that use pieces that are about the size of a small barrel.

<text>The European Security Strategy is the document in which the European Union clarifies its security strategy which is aimed at achieving a secure Europe in a better world, identifying the threats facing the Union, defining its strategic objectives and setting out the political implications for Europe. The European security strategy was drawn up in 2003 under the authority of the EU&#x27;s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, and adopted by the Brussels European Council of 12 and 13 December 2003.

The strategy was replaced in 2016 by the European Union Global Strategy.

<text>Christopher Douglas Paterson, MBE (born 30 March 1978) is an ambassador and specialist coach for the Scotland and Edinburgh rugby union teams. He is a former professional rugby union player who played for Scotland and, for the most part of his career, Edinburgh. Paterson is Scotland&#x27;s record points scorer with 809 points and second most-capped player with 109 caps. He was capable of playing in a range of positions, including fullback, wing and fly-half.

Paterson retired from international rugby in December 2011 and as a professional player in May 2012.

==Early career==

Paterson started his rugby career with hometown club Gala, the highlight being a solo try that won Gala the 1999 Scottish Cup at Murrayfield. Soon after Paterson turned professional by signing for Glasgow where he played only two games before signing for Edinburgh Rugby. In becoming a professional player he dropped out of the University of Edinburgh where he was studying to become a PE teacher.

==Edinburgh==

From 2000 until 2002 Paterson played in the Scottish/Welsh League, the predecessor to the competition now known as Pro14 (prior to the addition of Irish teams). He was part of the Edinburgh squad that reached the Heineken Cup quarter finals in 2003–04. For seven years he was a mainstay of the Edinburgh squad. With the ongoing dispute between the SRU and then Edinburgh Rugby owner Bob Carruthers over the refusal to release Edinburgh players for a pre-2007 World Cup training camp, Paterson left Edinburgh for Gloucester by mutual consent. On 24 July 2007, Paterson signed a three-year contract with Gloucester.

==Gloucester==
Paterson&#x27;s spell with Gloucester was largely disappointing due to limited game time throughout the 2007–08 season. It was announced on 2 May 2008 that Paterson would return to Edinburgh Rugby for the 2008–09 season
He played 14 games during his stay scoring 38 points, the highlight being a 50-metre breakaway try in the derby game against Bath

==Edinburgh==
Paterson re-signed for Edinburgh Rugby upon leaving Gloucester and has remained a fixture in the line up ever since.
One of Paterson&#x27;s top skills – his goal-kicking – was typified in Edinburgh Rugby&#x27;s last home game of the 2008–09 Celtic League season which saw a 43–3 home win against Newport Gwent Dragons on 9 May 2009. Paterson scored 28 points, kicking nine from nine with five penalties, four conversions and a try.

As of 4 April 2012, Paterson is the 5th highest points scorer in Pro12 history with 778 points (21T 113C 4D 145P). He played his last professional match against Benetton Treviso on 5 May 2012 at Murrayfield Stadium. Despite an unusually long absence from the score sheet partly owing to injury, Paterson scored Edinburgh Rugby&#x27;s third try of the match leading to a 44–21 victory.

==International career==

===Early Career 1999–2003===

Paterson earned his first cap for Scotland against Spain in the 1999 Rugby World Cup as a fullback. This was his only appearance during the 1999 World Cup. Scotland went on to reach the quarter finals before losing 30–18 to New Zealand.

In Paterson&#x27;s next appearance during the 2000 Six Nations Championship game versus France, Paterson scored his first points for Scotland converting two penalties and a conversion in the 16–28 loss. Later that year Paterson scored his first Scotland try during the 2000 tour of New Zealand during the 48–14 loss at Eden Park, Auckland.

During the subsequent years Paterson became a fixture in the Scotland team. His consistent performance for club and country earned him a place in Scotland&#x27;s 2003 Rugby World Cup squad.

During Scotland&#x27;s opening 2003 Rugby World Cup game Paterson scored two tries and kicked a conversion and a penalty during a 32–11 win against Japan. In the next game against the United States Paterson scored 19 points, including a try, during a 39–15 win. Paterson played in the subsequent win and loss against Fiji and France to help Scotland qualify for the quarter final stage. In the 2003 Rugby World cup quarter-finals, Scotland lost 33–16 to Australia at Lang Park, Brisbane.

Paterson scored 71 points during the 2003 Rugby World Cup and was named the team&#x27;s player of the tournament.

===2003–2007===
On 15 November 2004 during Scotland&#x27;s record 100–8 win 
over Japan game at McDiarmid Park, Perth he overtook Andy Irvine to become Scotland&#x27;s second highest points scorer, behind Gavin Hastings. He scored 40 points (three tries, 11 conversions and one penalty). This remains a record points haul for a Scottish player in a test match.

Two weeks later on 27 November 2004 against South Africa he became the youngest, and lightest, Scottish player ever to earn 50 caps, aged 26, and weighing in at 78 kg.

On 26 February 2005, Paterson equalled the scoring record set by Gavin Hastings for one game of six penalties converted in the 18–13 win over Italy. Paterson was the BBC&#x27;s full-back of the 2005 Six Nations Championship.

As a result of his incredibly reliable kicking and elusive running from full-back during the 2005 Six Nations Championship, especially in the Calcutta Cup game, Paterson&#x27;s omission from Clive Woodward&#x27;s squad for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand surprised many critics and fans alike. This fueled criticism that Woodward relied too much upon his England team who had won the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Ultimately, Woodward&#x27;s 2005 Lions were unsuccessful losing the test series 3–0.

Paterson played as part of a resurgent Scotland team of the 2006 Six Nations Championship who recorded wins over France, England and Italy to finish third in the table. This remains Scotland&#x27;s best finish since the 5 Nations became the 6 Nations with the addition of Italy in 2000.

Paterson was captain during the 2007 Six Nations Championship as Jason White was injured.

Paterson was picked in Scotland&#x27;s 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. This his third World Cup campaign. Similarly, with the previous two in 1999 &amp; 2003 Scotland exited in the quarter final stage losing 19–13 to Argentina at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis. Paterson played in all five of Scotland&#x27;s games scoring 46 points. He deployed a flawless kicking performance on the final stage group game, a decider against Italy (against whom they had suffered a home defeat at the previous Six Nations): Paterson secured qualification by scoring all points of Scotland&#x27;s narrow 18–16 victory, with an impeccable 6 out of 6 kicking performance.

===Later career 2008–2011===

On 9 February 2008, Paterson earned his 83rd cap for Scotland against Wales, passing the record of Gregor Townsend for a Scottish back. Scotland then went on to lose this match.

Later that year on 14 June 2008 he won his 88th cap to break Scott Murray&#x27;s Scotland appearance record and was named man of the match in Scotland&#x27;s 26–14 victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires. 
During the 2009 Autumn International against Australia, Paterson scored winning points in Scotland&#x27;s historic 9–8 win. This was Scotland&#x27;s first win over Australia for 27 years.

On 7 February 2010, Paterson won his 99th cap in Scotland&#x27;s opening 2010 Six Nations Championship match against France.

On Saturday 13 February 2010 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Paterson became the first player to reach 100 caps for Scotland when he played in the defeat against Wales. In the same game Paterson was seriously injured, suffering a split kidney which forced him to miss the rest of the season. In the same game Rory Lamont suffered cruciate ligament damage which ended his season, and Thom Evans suffered a potentially life-threatening neck injury in a collision with Lee Byrne. This injury forced Evans to retire from rugby aged just 25.

Later that year on Saturday 20 November 2010 Paterson gained his 101st cap in a 21–17 win against current world champions, South Africa, at Murrayfield coming on for the final 8 minutes. Along with Nikki Walker and Nathan Hines, he was one of three players in that match who had also been in the Scotland team that beat South Africa in 2002.

During the 2011 Six Nations Championship Paterson was the 23rd man in the squad when he travelled to Paris but played no part. Following Scotland&#x27;s poor defeat to Wales in the second game of the tournament, Paterson was recalled to the starting 15 for the Ireland, England and Italy games. In addition to scoring 31 points with the boot in these three matches he justified his inclusion with an impressive try-saving tackle on Ben Foden, when the England Fullback seemed certain to score. This helped to keep Scotland in with a chance of winning the game until the last few minutes, although they eventually lost 22–16. The following week he made an almost identical try-saving tackle against Luke McLean during Scotland&#x27;s 21–8 victory over Italy. In the latter match, Paterson also became only the fifth player to score more than 400 points in the history of the Five/Six Nations Tournament.

Testament to Paterson&#x27;s committed performances during the 2011 Six Nations Championship he featured in several rugby journalists &#x27;Team of the Championship&#x27;

On 22 August 2011 Paterson was selected in Scotland&#x27;s 2011 Rugby World Cup squad meaning this would be in fourth Rugby World Cup.

Paterson scored 14 points in Scotland&#x27;s opening game of the 2011 Rugby World Cup in the 34–24 victory over Romania

In Scotland&#x27;s second pool game of the 2011 Rugby World Cup during the 15–6 victory over Georgia Paterson made a substitute appearance in the 70th minute his 13th World Cup appearance one short of Doddie Weir&#x27;s record of 14 World Cup appearances.

In Scotland&#x27;s third pool game in the 13–12 defeat against Argentina Paterson equalled Doddie Weir&#x27;s record of 14 appearances scoring a penalty.

In what transpired to be Chris Paterson&#x27;s 109th and final appearance in the ultimate game of Pool B against England in Auckland, Scotland required victory to progress to the quarter-final stage. The game finished 16–12 in England&#x27;s favour with Chris Ashton scoring a last minute try to knock Scotland out at the pool stage for the first time. In this game he set a record for the most Scotland World Cup appearances with 15 and furthered his own Scotland point&#x27;s scoring record to 809. 
Paterson announced his retirement from international rugby in December 2011; at the time, he held many of the most significant Scottish career records. His 109 caps was more than 20 clear of then-second-placed Scott Murray; his 96 starts are also the most in Scotland history. He remained Scotland&#x27;s most-capped player until Ross Ford overtook him in 2017. Paterson was also involved in more defeats (65) than any other Scotland internationalist. Despite not being a regular kicker until after he had amassed 26 caps, he retired as Scotland&#x27;s all-time leader in points (809), conversions (86) and penalties (140). Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his Scotland career was his versatility; he retired as one of Scotland&#x27;s three top cap-winners at two different positions. Paterson&#x27;s 49 caps on the wing were third to Kenny Logan (63) and Sean Lamont (52); his 43 caps as a fullback were also third, this time to Gavin Hastings (61) and Andy Irvine (47). In addition, he has the most caps of any player from the Home Unions (England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales) who did not appear in a Test with the British &amp; Irish Lions.

===Coaching and rugby ambassador 2012 onwards===
In May 2012 it was announced that Paterson would take on the dual role of specialist coach and ambassador with the Scottish Rugby Union.

==Kicking Accuracy==

During his time as Scotland&#x27;s and Edinburgh Rugby&#x27;s goal kicker Paterson amassed 1860 points.

Paterson successfully kicked 36 consecutive goals for Scotland between 11 August 2007 and 7 June 2008, not missing a single attempt during the 2007 Rugby World Cup or the 2008 Six Nations Championship. This run was brought to an end during 7 June 2008 Test against Argentina. This is believed to have been a world record for consecutive successful kicks at goal in Test play since such statistics were first kept in the late 1980s; this record was broken in 2010 by Morné Steyn of South Africa. During the aforementioned Argentina match, Paterson also overtook Gavin Hastings&#x27; long standing Scotland points record of 667, as well as equalling Scott Murray&#x27;s record of 87 caps for Scotland.

During his playing career he scored 809 points for Scotland (22 Tries, 90 Conversions, 170 Penalties and 3 drop goals).

For Edinburgh Rugby Paterson has amassed 773 points (20T 113C 4D 145P) in the Pro12 and 287 points (9T,40C,0D,54P)in the Heineken Cup He retired from international duty on 21 December 2011, and from Edinburgh Rugby May 2012.

==Other==

Paterson&#x27;s high profile in Scotland has been used in marketing campaigns for several companies. In 2011 he appeared on cereal boxes for Scott&#x27;s Porage Oats along with Ross Ford and Thom Evans. MacSween Haggis used him to front a new product range

Paterson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to Scottish rugby. In June 2012 he received an honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from Edinburgh Napier University.

<text>Aracataca (colloquially sometimes referred to as &quot;Cataca&quot;) is a town and municipality located in the Department of Magdalena, in Colombia&#x27;s Caribbean Region. Aracataca is a river town founded in 1885. The town stands beside a small river of the same name, the Aracataca river, that flows from the nearby Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range into the Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, a lagoon of the Caribbean Sea. Aracataca is south of the Department capital Santa Marta. The town is best known as the birthplace of Nobel literature laureate Gabriel García Márquez.

==Geography and climate==
The municipality borders to the north with the municipalities of Zona Bananera, Santa Marta and Cienaga, to the east with the Cesar Department, to the south with the municipality of Fundación, and to the west with the municipalities of El Retén and Pueblo Viejo.

Aracataca&#x27;s climate is tropical: warm and humid year-round.

==History==
Aracataca was founded in 1885. It achieved the status of municipality on 28 April 1915, when it separated from the municipality of Pueblo Viejo. In the late 19th century, companies that would later merge into the United Fruit Company colonized the land and started to cultivate bananas in the wide region. After some decades, the downfall of the company initiated and completed soon after, partly because of the worldwide recession and the war soon after.

Aracataca is the inspiration for the fictional town of Macondo in Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. On June 25, 2006, a referendum to rename the town &quot;Aracataca-Macondo&quot; failed due to a low turnout.

==Economy==
Aracataca relies heavily on agriculture, mainly producing Oil palm, rice, cotton, sugar cane, common bean, plantain, bananas, yuca, tomato and on livestock raising like cattle, equines, mules, donkeys, domesticated birds, goats and pigs. Commerce represents another form of income and is mostly done informally, especially along the main highway to Santa Marta where large lines of stands selling beach towels are placed.

== Transportation ==
There are several companies that offer inter-municipal and inter-departmental transportation on medium-size buses, minivans and taxi cabs. Most tourists and locals use Berlinas del Fonce which has busses leaving the Santa Marta terminal every 30 minutes between 5am and 6pm. $9.000 p.p.
From the transportation office in Aracataca you can get almost everywhere using a ciclotaxi for just $1.000 p.p.
The rivers are not navigable and there are a few small rudimentary airfields used by small aircraft for agricultural fumigation. The municipality and town are crossed by the Highway 45 that extends from Santa Marta, crosses Aracataca, Fundación, El Copey, Bosconia, Curumani into the Cesar Department and turns south towards the Colombian Andean Region. The railway no longer works for public transportation, it is used almost exclusively to transport coal from the region of La Loma Calentura in the Cesar Department to the Port of Santa Marta.

== Notable People ==
Gabriel Garcia Márquez

Gabriel José de la Concordia García Márquez, affectionately known as Gabo or Gabito throughout Latin America, was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist. Born on March 6, 1927, in Aracataca, Colombia, he is considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, particularly in the Spanish language. García Márquez received the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. His acclaimed works include “One Hundred Years of Solitude” (1967), which sold over fifty million copies, “Chronicle of a Death Foretold” (1981), and “Love in the Time of Cholera” (1985). He popularized the literary style known as magic realism, blending magical elements with otherwise ordinary situations. García Márquez’s legacy endures as the most-translated Spanish-language author. Upon his death in April 2014, he was hailed by the president of Colombia as “the greatest Colombian who ever lived&quot;.

B Leo Matiz

Leo Matiz (1917–1998) was a Colombian photographer, caricaturist, newspaper publisher, painter, and gallery owner. Born in the small village of Aracataca, Colombia, he shared his hometown with the author Gabriel García Márquez. Matiz traveled extensively, selling caricatures and illustrations to support himself. His gallery hosted the first exhibition of Colombian artist Fernando Botero in 1951. Known for his distinctive style, including long hair, colored jackets, and a gangster-style mustache, Matiz photographed notable figures such as Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Louis Armstrong. His work appeared in publications like &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Reader’s Digest&quot;, and &quot;Harper Magazine&quot;. Despite losing an eye due to a robbery, Matiz continued photographing with an eye patch until his death in Bogotá in 1998. The Foundation Leo Matiz was established to preserve his legacy

Antonio Jaramillo

Antonio Jaramillo, affectionately known as &quot;, was a Colombian musician and composer who left an indelible mark on the folklore of his hometown, Aracataca. His life story is intertwined with the soulful rhythms of Colombian folk music, particularly the guaracha style. Let me share a glimpse of his fascinating journey:

* Early Years and Musical Passion: Antonio Jaramillo, nicknamed &quot;, discovered his love for music at an early age. By the tender age of four, he had already picked up an accordion and held onto it tightly, setting the stage for a lifelong musical journey.
* The Acordeón del Diablo: Jaramillo’s life became the subject of a captivating documentary titled , directed by Stefan Schwietert. This 90-minute masterpiece delves into the life of Pacho Rada, a master accordionist from Aracataca. Rada’s music resonated with the soul of the Colombian people, and his legacy endures.
* A Crowded Farewell: When Antonio Jaramillo passed away on March 20, 2012, Aracataca mourned him like no other. His funeral drew a massive crowd, filling both the church and the town square. People dressed in mourning attire, tears flowing under the intense sun. Jaramillo’s music, reminiscent of Guillermo Buitrago’s style, had touched countless lives.

==Culture==
===Festivities===
Aracatacans celebrate the Roman Catholic tradition of Three Kings on January 6 of every year, Carnivals and the Holy Week between February and March, a cultural week, The Festival of the Unedited Song (), The municipality&#x27;s anniversary in April and the River Festival ().
The Fiestas Patronales which consist of large outdoor concerts and semi bullfights this year is being held from 15 July till the 24th.
==Tourism==
Tourism in Aracataca is growing, but still at a low level. The most famous attraction is the house in which Gabriel García Márquez grew up, now the Casa Museo (Museum House). Another museum, Casa del Telegrafista, is also popular. In addition, the recently renovated train station will serve as an exhibition hall for photographs by Leo Matiz, a native of Aracataca.

García Márquez often referenced this house in his works, including his masterpiece &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; where it served as inspiration for the Buendía family home. Today, the Casa del Telegrafista has been restored and transformed into a museum dedicated to García Márquez and his literary legacy. Visitors can explore the house and learn about the author&#x27;s early life, his connections to Aracataca, and the influences that shaped his writing. The museum provides a glimpse into García Márquez&#x27;s upbringing and the magical realism that permeates his novels, making it a must-visit destination for fans of his work and literature enthusiasts alike.

5. Melquiades Tombstone: In Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; Melquiades is a mysterious and enigmatic character who plays a pivotal role in the story. Melquiades is depicted as a wandering gypsy and a bringer of knowledge and mysticism to the town of Macondo. His presence is felt throughout the narrative, even after his death, as his writings and inventions continue to influence the characters and events in the story.

Because Melquiades was the first person to die in Macondo, to increase the sense of belonging for the local townspeople related to the legacy of Garcia Márquez, it was decided to erect a tombstone to this &#x27;greatest benefactor of Macondo&#x27;.

With works like: Love in the Time of Cholera, One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Chronicle of a death Foretold, &quot;Gabito&quot; not only excelled in storytelling, he was a master of conveying perspective, love, and identity. Born in Aracataca in 1927 as grandson of the great Colonel Nicolas Márquez, he witnessed quintessential events since he was a little baby. 

Aracataca was Garcia Márquez&#x27;s first stomping grounds. His childhood home, now the Casa Museo, and the church where he was baptised are both major tourist attractions.

<doc id="1203523" wikidata="Q7880468" url="?curid=1203523" title="Ultra Marines">
<text>Ultra Marines is one of a series of 4 &quot;introductory&quot; board games released by Games Workshop in 1991 (The other three being Space Fleet, Kerrunch and Mighty Warriors). Set in the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, it is effectively a &#x27;scaled-down&#x27; version of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; and &quot;Tyranid Attack&quot;, using plastic Marine Scouts from the Ultramarines, Space Wolves, Dark Angels and Blood Angels chapters. Other components include event cards, a simple ruleset, as well as corridor and room tiles from the game &quot;Space Hulk&quot;.

==Rules==
Before the game begins, players arranged the interlocking room and corridor tiles on the playing area to represent a maze (a &quot;Space Hulk&quot;). Alien Artefact counters are randomly placed throughout the play area. Each player sets up their 5 models in a starting room of their choice and then take turns to move their pieces. The object of the game is to move the various Scout models to retrieve the artefacts and carry them to the starting rooms while stopping opponent models from achieving the same goal. Random event cards are dealt to each player that allows them to either help their own models (in the form of medipacks or double movement) or hinder opponents (by placing obstacles in their path or attacking them directly).

Unlike other Games Workshop games, Ultra Marines featured a unique method of determining the accuracy of weapons fire and close combat attacks. The box of the game featured a grid printed on the inside of the lid, and dice were thrown into the lid and the results read from the squares that the dice landed in. However, this led to eventual problems after release as the cardboard box would warp or become worn after years of use and the distortion of the box lid would skew results.

<doc id="1203527" wikidata="Q2520380" url="?curid=1203527" title="Left of the Middle">
<text>Left of the Middle is the debut studio album by Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia. It was released by RCA Records on 24 November 1997 in the United Kingdom, followed by most international territories in early 1998. Primarily writing and recording the album in the UK, Imbruglia worked with a number of English producers, including Phil Thornalley, Andy Wright and Nigel Godrich, and at the final stage of the album production, she traveled to Nashville, the US and co-wrote a song with American songwriter Matt Bronleewe. &quot;Left of the Middle&quot; is an alternative pop album which incorporates element of electronic sound. The lead single &quot;Torn&quot; (1997) was a worldwide commercial success and has since been named as one of the Best Songs of 1990s by several publications, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.

Commercially, &quot;Left of the Middle&quot; topped the album music chart in Australia as well as charted within top five in the United Kingdom and top ten in the United States, and has been sold over seven million copies worldwide. The album won Best Australian Debut Album and Best Pop Release at the 12th ARIA Music Award in 1998 and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards in 1999. In late 2022, Imbruglia toured the UK to celebrate 25 year anniversary of the album.

==Background, writing and production==
At the time Imbruglia signed a record deal with BMG/RCA, it was the moment when RCA Records was looking for a female alternative act, a singer like Sheryl Crow at A&amp;M or Alanis Morissette at Warner Bros., and it was Phil Thornalley’s demos which he recorded with Imbruglia that impressed Anne Barret, Imbruglia future manager who took and played the demos to Jeremy Marsh, BMG Executive and finally signed Imbruglia to RCA Records. Imbruglia co-wrote all the songs in the album, except for &quot;Torn&quot; and &quot;Don’t You Think&quot;. She admitted that she was really insecure when she was making &quot;Left of the Middle&quot;, and described that prior to recording sessions, she would over-prepare by seeking inspiration from pre-written poetry excessively.

&quot;Pigeons and Crumbs&quot;, written by Mark Goldenberg and Imbruglia, explores the struggles of a person in his/her early twenties living in the big city or big community. &quot;City&quot;, written by Imbruglia and Thornalley, refers to false friends who disappeared when hardship came along. In addition to writing and recording in the UK, Imbruglia traveled to Nashville and collaborated with Matt Bronleewe and wrote &quot;Smoke&quot;, which tells story about a kid whose needs are not being met by parents.

Five songs on the album were mixed by Radiohead&#x27;s frequent collaborator, Nigel Godrich, and seven songs on the album were produced by Phil Thornalley.

==Commercial performance==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Left of the Middle&quot; debuted and peaked at number five on 06 December 1997, spending 15 weeks in the Top 10 and total of 101 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 100 until 27 January 2001. The album eventually sold 1.2 million copies in the UK, and has been certified triple platinum by BPI.

In Australia, the album debuted at number three on 15 March 1998, before falling to number 18 the next week. The album slowly climbed the chart in the following weeks and reached number one spot in August 1998, spending 61 total weeks in the Top 50 until 1999. The album was ranked five on the ARIA Top 100 Albums of 1998, and 68 on the ARIA Top 100 Albums of 1999. &quot;Left of the Middle&quot; has been certified five times platinum by ARIA and sold over 350,000 copies. 

In the United States, the album was released a week after Imbruglia’s performance on &quot;SNL, &quot; and debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 Album Chart by 28 March 1998, the album spent 52 consecutive weeks on the chart and sold over two million copies, and certified double platinum by RIAA.

&quot;Left of the Middle&quot; has sold over seven million copies worldwide.

==Critical reception==

Greg Prato from AllMusic gave the album a positive review, stating that one of the material will be seen as pop fluff by certain listeners, but fans of popular latter-day female artists like Paula Cole, Sheryl Crow, and Meredith Brooks will find Imbruglia&#x27;s debut most enjoyable, and praise Imburglia’s willingness to experiment with electronic sound. Sara Scribner from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album 3 out of 4 stars, saying that the album is a good pop record to break up to and Imbruglia dispels doubts with a smoky, believable voice tinged with just enough real-life ambivalence and anger. 

However, Rob Sheffield from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a negative review, with 2 out of 5 stars, saying that on her album, too many cooks spoil the broth, adding rock guitars and industrial clank beats that have nothing to do with her fey charms. Mark Bautz from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also gave the album negative review, highlighted the lack of originality, outdated production and its sonic similarity to Rickie Lee and Alanis Morissette.

==Singles==

Following the commercial performance in the international market, &quot;Torn&quot;&quot; made its debut at the United States’ Billboard Radio Songs Chart on 14 February 1998 and eventually reached number one on 16 May 1998, the song stayed atop the chart for 11 consecutive weeks, the song also topped Billboard Adult Top 40 Chart for 14 consecutive weeks.

<text>The Scottish Chess Championship is organised by Chess Scotland, formerly the Scottish Chess Association. It has been running since 1884, and nowadays takes the form of a nine-round tournament played over two weekends and the week in between. Auxiliary tournaments, such as grading-limited sections and a senior championship take place over the first seven days and there is a Weekend Congress on the second weekend.

Originally, the championship was by invitation only and could only be won by players who would be eligible to compete internationally for Scotland, but sometimes a titled player of another nationality was invited to compete in order to make title norms more likely.

In 2008 the Championship was replaced by an international open. The Scottish Champion being determined by the highest finishing Scottish player. The 2009 tournament being held in Edinburgh attracted nine Grandmasters. The 2010 event took place in Hamilton with the 2011 event back in Edinburgh. The 2014 Championships was incorporated into the Commonwealth Chess Championships which was held in Glasgow. In 2015 the Event was held in Edinburgh and the 2016 event will be back In Glasgow

The current Tournament Arbiters are IA Alex McFarlane and IA Andy Howie.

==Notable Winners==

Recent notable winners include Ketevan Arakhamia-Grant in 2003 – the first woman player to win the Scottish Championship, and Jonathan Rowson, who became the first Scottish player to clinch the Grandmaster title on home soil in 1999, and did the Scottish / British double in 2004. In 2013 Roddy McKay won the title some 39 years after first winning his first title in 1974. In 2018 Murad Abdulla became the youngest Double winner of the title.

<text>Wilhelm Reichsfreiherr von Innhausen und Knyphausen (4 November 1716 Lütetsburg, East Frisia – 7 December 1800 Kassel) was a German general officer who served in Hesse-Kassel. He fought in the American Revolutionary War, during which he commanded Hessian auxiliaries on behalf of Great Britain.

==Biography==
Knyphausen&#x27;s father was the colonel of a Prussian regiment under the Duke of Marlborough. Educated in Berlin, the young Knyphausen entered the Prussian military service in 1734, and in 1775 he became a general officer in the army of Frederick the Great. In the army of Hesse-Cassel, he was a lieutenant general. In 1776, with 42 years of military experience, he came to the Thirteen Colonies of British North America as second-in-command of an army of 12,000 men called &quot;Hessians&quot; under General Heister.

Knyphausen led the Hessian troops in the Battles of White Plains, Fort Washington, Brandywine, Germantown, Springfield, and Monmouth. In 1779 and 1780, he commanded British-held New York City. When Heister left for Germany, Knyphausen took command of the German troops serving under Sir William Howe. Because of Knyphausen&#x27;s seniority, British officers held dormant commissions outranking him in case the British commander became disabled. Despite this, Knyphausen was trusted by his British superiors.

Knyphausen&#x27;s regiment took part in the attack on Fort Washington and was in garrison at Trenton, New Jersey. Major von Dechow, who was in command in late 1776, warned Colonel Johann Rall to fortify the town, advice that was ignored. During the Battle of Trenton the regiment tried to escape across Assunpink Creek but was forced to surrender. Dechow was mortally wounded during the battle.

Sir William Howe gave Knyphausen responsibility for commanding the right flank at the Brandywine, tasked with keeping the attention of the Continental commanders on the river line at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. He also commanded the vanguard of the army withdrawing from Philadelphia at the time of the Battle of Monmouth.

For several years the main body of Knyphausen&#x27;s force occupied the upper part of Manhattan Island, and during the temporary absence of Sir Henry Clinton in 1780, he was in command of the city.

Knyphausen&#x27;s regiment served in the Americas from 1776 to 1783. 
Knyphausen left the North American theater in 1782 in part because of ill health, including blindness in one eye caused by a cataract. His wife had died in 1778. Friedrich Wilhelm von Lossberg succeeded to command of the Hessian troops in New York.

Knyphausen returned to Europe, having, as he said, achieved neither glory nor advancement, but near the end of his life he became military governor of Cassel. He was a taciturn and discreet officer, who understood the temper of his troops and rarely entered on hazardous exploits. His was a hireling army of recruits gathered from work-houses and by impressment, drilled in the use of arms on shipboard. As he frequently declared, on such forces a judicious commander could place little reliance; they dwindled less by death than by desertion.

In 1785, shortly after the end of the war, General Lafayette travelled to Cassel and met Knyphausen. He wrote to General Washington that they had reminisced about the war and exchanged compliments. Knyphausen died in 1800 as the result of an eye surgery.

==Legacy==
Fort Hill Park in Staten Island, New York is the site of what was once called Fort Knyphausen, an earthen redoubt built to fend off Patriot forces. One of the streets of Glasgow, Delaware is called North General Knyphausen Court.

<doc id="1203530" wikidata="Q4809895" url="?curid=1203530" title="Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers">
<text>The Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers (ALAM), began as the Manufacturer&#x27;s Mutual Association (MMA), an organization originally formed to challenge the litigation of the fledgling automobile industry by George B. Selden and the Electric Vehicle Company. Ultimately, the organization took advantage of its power and became Selden&#x27;s greatest ally. In exchange for favorable royalty rates, the group gained the power to litigate and exclude other manufacturers from licensing, making them the most powerful group in the early automotive industry.

== Early history ==

In 1899, the Electric Vehicle Company purchased the rights to Selden&#x27;s automobile patent. The patent was deemed flimsy by most of the industry, but the company purchased the rights to guarantee the legality of their new venture, the Columbia Automobile Company. A year later, however, the Columbia Automobile Company was in shambles thanks to internal corruption and low demand for electric vehicles, and the Electric Vehicle Company turned to the Selden patent as an alternative source of revenue. They set out to have manufacturers pay a 5% royalty on all cars produced.

By 1900, The Electric Vehicle Company launched several lawsuits against automobile manufacturers. Their ultimate target among the fray was Alexander Winton, and his Winton Motor Carriage Company. Originally formed in 1896, the Winton Company was by 1900 the highest-volume automobile producer in the US. If the patent were to gain validity in the industry, Selden believed, they needed to tackle the largest manufacturer.

The Winton Company&#x27;s defense made the costly mistake of concentrating on challenging the patent’s validity through demurrer; by 1902 the case was still tied up and Winton was considering a settlement. In response to his distress, other independent automobile makers formed a group called the Manufacturers Mutual Association to breathe new life into Winton&#x27;s legal defense. Formed by Henry Bourne Joy of Packard and Frederic L. Smith of Olds, the two entrepreneurs used their position to threaten the Electric Vehicle Company. The MMA called for much lower royalty payments and for the legal and license rights to be controlled by the MMA, or else they would bolster Winton&#x27;s dying legal fund.

== Control of the industry ==

By 1903, the organization had officially become the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers, and had secured favorable rights from the Electric Vehicle Company. Only a few months after the formation of the organization, Winton became an ALAM member, and the suit against his company was dropped. The patent had gained legitimacy without ever having its validity determined.

The ALAM gained from the agreement, giving them control over the entire automobile industry for a relatively low cost. The group negotiated a 1.25% royalty on all cars produced, one-half of one percent of which went directly into the ALAM legal and operations funds. Applications for ALAM membership and a Selden license were granted only by the unanimous decision of a five-member executive board. This system left ALAM members with royalties considerably lower than the costs of trying the Selden patent in the courts, and gave existing members the ability to exclude and even litigate unlicensed competitors.

The ALAM&#x27;s exclusionary policies were ultimately its undoing. The up-and-coming Ford Motor Company was capitalized in 1903, and Henry Ford immediately attempted to secure a Selden license. He was denied, officially due to his past business failures (the Detroit Automobile Company and the Henry Ford Company, specifically), and also due to the protectionist climate of the ALAM. Frederic Smith of Olds was the executive board member most outspoken against Ford’s admission to the ALAM, and also had the most to lose from such an admission, as he held most of the Detroit market for mass-produced automobiles.

On October 22, 1903, the ALAM filed suit with the Ford Motor Company, and what followed was a messy public relations battle. The ALAM launched a campaign threatening to sue those who purchased Ford automobiles. Ford responded in-kind, summing up their position as, &quot;We believe that the art would have been just as far advanced to-day if Mr. Selden had never been born.&quot;

On September 15, 1909, presiding judge Charles Merrill Hough found legitimacy in the Selden patent. The court of appeals later overturned the ruling, finding in favor of Ford on January 9, 1911. ALAM chose not to contest the ruling.

<text>Thomas Putnam ( – , 1699) was a member of the Putnam family, a resident of Salem Village (present-day Danvers, Massachusetts, United States) and a significant accuser in the notorious 1692 Salem witch trials.

== Biography ==
Thomas Putnam was born on March 22, 1652 (new style March 12, 1651) in Salem Village, Massachusetts Bay Colony, a son of Lieutenant Thomas Putnam Sr. (1615–1686) and his first wife, Ann Holyoke. He was baptized on February 16, 1652, at the First Church of Salem. He married Ann Carr on September 25, 1675, at Salem Village. Ann was born at Salem Village on June 15, 1661, the youngest daughter of George and Elizabeth Carr. They had twelve children: Ann Jr., Thomas, Elizabeth, Ebenzer, Ebenezer, Deliverance, Timothy, Experience, Abigail, Susanna and Seth; two who died young. Thomas served in the military and held the rank of Sergeant, fighting in King Philip&#x27;s War. He also served as parish clerk. 

Despite being the son of one of Salem&#x27;s wealthiest residents, Putnam was excluded from major inheritances by both his father and father-in-law. His half-brother, Joseph, who had benefited most from their father&#x27;s estate, married into the rival Porter family in Salem Town, fueling ill will between the clans. Putnam, his wife Ann, and their daughter Ann Jr. all levied accusations of witchcraft, many of them against extended members of the Porter family, and testified at the trials. Putnam was responsible for the accusations of 43 people, and his daughter was responsible for 62. 

Both Putnam and his wife died in 1699, leaving their ten children orphans, two children having predeceased them.

In Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1953 play, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, Thomas Putnam is married to Ann Putnam, and together have a daughter, Ruth Putnam, who is afflicted with a grave illness, similar to that of Betty Parris. They both have lost seven children in childbirth and point to witchcraft as the cause of it. Putnam appears in Act 1 and is apparent during Act 3. He manipulates Reverend Parris into taking his side, urging him to see that it is witchcraft that is making Salem go mad. He uses the witch trials to get the other villagers&#x27; land, such as Giles Corey&#x27;s. Giles later takes Putnam to court regarding the issue.

== In Popular Culture ==
In &quot;Burned: A Daughters of Salem Novel&quot;, a 2023 young adult novel by Kellie O&#x27;Neill, a minor character named &quot;Blaire Putnam&quot; is a descendant of Thomas Putnam.

<text>Lucia Cifarelli (born September 23, 1970) is an American singer, best known for her work with industrial band KMFDM. She was formerly the vocalist for the band Drill and also performed in KMFDM offshoots MDFMK, KGC, and Schwein.

== Career ==
Cifarelli got her start recording in studios in New York, eventually forming her own band, Drill, along with future Black Label Society bass guitarist John DeServio. Drill released one self-titled album, spawning two music videos and getting a third song featured in the movie &quot;Empire Records&quot;. Later in 1995, Drill opened for Stabbing Westward&#x27;s &quot;Wither, Blister, Burn, and Peel&quot; Tour. The band broke up shortly after the end of the tour.

Cifarelli joined the KMFDM-hiatus band MDFMK in 2000. The project lasted for one self-titled album. In 2001, Cifarelli and Sascha Konietzko worked on the supergroup Schwein and its albums &quot;Schweinstein&quot; and the subsequent remix album &quot;Son of Schweinstein&quot;. After the MDFMK project was discontinued, Cifarelli was asked to return as a member of KMFDM. She has been a member of the band since 2002&#x27;s &quot;Attak&quot;. She recorded two solo albums, &quot;From the Land of Volcanos&quot; (2003) and &quot;I Am Eye&quot; (2021). One single from the first album, &quot;I Will&quot;, appeared on the &quot;American Pie 2&quot; soundtrack. Cifarelli performed on the band KGC&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Dirty Bomb&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Lucia Cifarelli was born on September 23, 1970, in Long Island, New York. The youngest of four children, she grew up surrounded by music and art, developing a love for singing, songwriting and performing at an early age. Cifarelli&#x27;s first vocal coach, Tanya Travers, whom she found in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; classified ads at fourteen, introduced Cifarelli to her first songwriting collaborator Dan Wise, who would later go on to produce such notable artists as Run-DMC, The New York Dolls, Ani Difranco, 22 Brides, John Mayor and The Scissor Sisters.
Travers would later introduce Cifarelli to music producer Ric Wake, who signed her band Drill to A&amp;M Records.

Due to a label restructuring, the band was dropped upon delivery of their sophomore effort and later broke up. Not long after Cifarelli joined MDFMK, an offshoot of KMFDM, where she co-wrote, recorded and toured with the band for their only album on Republic Records.

Before the reformation of KMFDM, Cifarelli secured a record deal with Universal Records and moved to London to record her first solo album &quot;From the Land of Volcanos&quot; with music producer Ian Stanley, one of the original members of Tears for Fears. Universal later declined to release it.

Since the reformation of KMFDM, Cifarelli has been a featured vocalist and co-writer on every album since 2002 and has played 456 shows with the band as of January 2020.

In November 2019, Cifarelli began writing her follow-up solo album. On July 2, 2021, she released the album &quot;I Am Eye&quot;.

In July 2005, she married KMFDM founder and producer Sascha Konietzko. They live in Hamburg, Germany, her husband&#x27;s hometown. The couple has one daughter (Annabella Asia Konietzko, born February 14, 2008).

<text>Microcosmographia Academica (&quot;A Study of a Tiny Academic World&quot; in Latin) is a short pamphlet on university politics written by F. M. Cornford and published in 1908. It has acquired a small cult following as a pessimistic view of academic politics presented in a readable and lively style, and is best known for its discussion of such principles as &quot;The (Thin End of the) Wedge&quot; and &quot;The Dangerous Precedent&quot;:

: The &quot;Principle of the Wedge&quot; is that you should not act justly now for fear of raising expectations that you may act still more justly in the futureexpectations which you are afraid you will not have the courage to satisfy. A little reflection will make it evident that the Wedge argument implies the admission that the persons who use it cannot prove that the action is not just. If they could, that would be the sole and sufficient reason for not doing it, and this argument would be superfluous.

: The &quot;Principle of the Dangerous Precedent&quot; is that you should not now do an admittedly right action for fear you, or your equally timid successors, should not have the courage to do right in some future case, which, &quot;ex hypothesi&quot;, is essentially different, but superficially resembles the present one. Every public action which is not customary, either is wrong, or, if it is right, is a dangerous precedent. It follows that nothing should ever be done for the first time.

The book is also known for Cornford&#x27;s definition, in the preface to a later edition, of propaganda as: &quot;that branch of the art of lying which consists in very nearly deceiving your friends without quite deceiving your enemies&quot;.

Although written for an audience familiar with the procedures of the University of Cambridge at the turn of the twentieth century, it could apply to any political system and is similar to the British television comedy &quot;Yes Minister&quot;; some of the dialogue in the &quot;Doing the Honours&quot; episode closely follows its text.

Christopher Hitchens quotes several parts and reflects upon this essay in his book &quot;Letters to a Young Contrarian&quot;, introducing it to the reader by quoting the above Principles of Wedge and Dangerous Precedent. &quot;F.M. Cornford [was] a witty Cambridge academic of the Edwardian period who had become used to every possible High Table euphemism and Senior Common Room obfuscation. He anatomised them all in his 1908 treatise, &quot;Microcosmographia Academia&quot;. The passage I’ll give you is from chapter 7, entitled &quot;Arguments&quot;: &quot;There is only one argument for doing something; the rest are arguments for doing nothing. Since the stone-axe fell into disuse at the close of the neolithic age, two other arguments of universal application have been added to the rhetorical armoury by the ingenuity of mankind. [...]&quot;&quot;

Gordon Johnson included it in his 2008 book &quot;University Politics: F. M. Cornford&#x27;s Cambridge and his Advice to the Young Academic Politician&quot; about the politics of the University of Cambridge, preceded by a description of the background against which Cornford was writing.

<text>Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park (formerly Ocmulgee National Monument) in Macon, Georgia, United States preserves traces of over ten millennia of culture from the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands. Its chief remains are major earthworks built before 1000 CE by the South Appalachian Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture.) These include the Great Temple and other ceremonial mounds, a burial mound, and defensive trenches. They represented highly skilled engineering techniques and soil knowledge, and the organization of many laborers. The site has evidence of &quot;12,000 years of continuous human habitation.&quot; The park is located on the east bank of the Ocmulgee River. Macon, Georgia developed around the site after the United States built Fort Benjamin Hawkins nearby in 1806 to support trading with Native Americans.

For thousands of years, succeeding cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples had settled on what is called the Macon Plateau at the Fall Line, where the rolling hills of the Piedmont met the Atlantic coastal plain. The monument designation included the Lamar Mounds and Village Site, located downriver about from Macon. The site was designated for federal protection by the National Park Service (NPS) in 1934, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and redesignated in 2019 as a national historical park.

==History==

===Macon Plateau culture===
Ocmulgee () is a memorial to ancient indigenous peoples in Southeastern North America. The name comes from the Mikasuki &quot;Oki Molki&quot;, meaning &#x27;Bubbling Water&#x27;. From Ice Age hunters to the Muscogee Creek tribe of historic times, the site has evidence of 12,000 years of human habitation. The Macon plateau was inhabited during the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Woodland phases.

The major occupation was ca. 950–1150 CE during the Early Mississippian-culture phase. The people of this sophisticated, stratified culture built the complex, massive earthworks that expressed their religious and political system. Archeologists call this society the Macon Plateau culture, a local expression of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture. During this period, an elite society supported by skillful farmers developed a town. Leaders directed the complex construction of large, earthwork platform mounds, the central structures on the plateau.

Carrying earth by hand in bags, thousands of workers built the -high Great Temple Mound on a high bluff overlooking the floodplain of the Ocmulgee River. Magnetometer scans have revealed the platform mound had a spiraling staircase oriented toward the floodplain. The staircase is unique among any of the Mississippian-culture sites. Other earthworks include at least one burial mound.

The people built rectangular wooden buildings to house certain religious ceremonies on the top of the platform mounds. The mounds at Ocmulgee were unusual because they were constructed further from each other than was typical of other Mississippian complexes. Scholars believe this was to provide for public space and residences around the mounds.

Circular earth lodges were built to serve as places to conduct meetings and important ceremonies. Remains of one of the earth lodges were carbon dated to 1050 CE. This evidence was the basis for the reconstructed lodge which archeologists later built at the park center. The interior features a raised-earth platform, shaped like an eagle with a forked-eye motif. Molded seats on the platform were built for the leaders. The eagle was a symbol of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, which the people shared with other Mississippian cultures.
=== Lamar Period ===
As the Mississippian culture declined at the ceremonial center, ca. 1350 a new culture coalesced among people who lived in the swamps downstream. The Late Mississippian period (1350–1600 CE), also consisted of the Lamar Period, where natives built two mounds that have survived at that site, including a unique spiral mound. The Lamar period is composed of four distinct phases that lasted between the years 1375 and 1670. It is identified through unique ceramic design elements that were primarily produced during this period. These four phases were the Duvall, Iron Horse, Dyar, and Bell phases.

The people at Lamar had a village associated with the mounds. They protected it by a constructed defensive palisade of logs placed vertically. They built rectangular houses, with roofs made of thatch or sod and clay-plastered walls, which were located around the mounds. This archeological site of a former settlement is now protected as the Lamar Mounds and Village Site.

Lamar pottery was distinctive, stamped with complex designs like the pottery of the earlier Woodland peoples. It was unlike other pottery of the Macon Plateau culture. Many archaeologists believe the Lamar culture was related to the earlier Woodland inhabitants, who, after being displaced by the newer Mississippian culture migrants, developed a hybrid culture. Late Woodland Period characteristics extended into the Mississippian Period of 800–1600 CE.

===Spanish contact===
In 1540, the expedition of Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto recorded its travel through the chiefdom of &quot;Ichisi.&quot; Historians and archeologists believe this was likely what is now known as the Lamar site. The Spaniards left a trail of destruction in their wake as they explored the present-day Southeastern U.S. in a failed search for precious metals. Their deadliest legacy of unintended consequences was likely related to the pigs they brought as food supply. Escaping pigs became feral, disrupting local habitat and spreading Eurasian infectious diseases. As the American Indians had no acquired immunity to these new diseases, they suffered high fatalities. The rate of deaths caused social dislocations and likely contributed to a collapse of the Mississippian cultures.

In the aftermath of De Soto&#x27;s expedition, the Mississippian cultures declined and disappeared. Hierarchical chiefdoms crumbled. They were replaced by loose confederacies of clans and the rise of historic regional tribes. The clans did not produce the agricultural surpluses of the previous society, which had supported the former population density and development of complex culture. Agriculture had enabled the development of hierarchy in the larger population. Its leaders planned and directed the &quot;corvée&quot; labor system that raised and maintained the great earthen mounds. The culture supported artisans as well.

===Muscogee in the colonial era===
By the late 18th century, the largest Native American confederacy in present-day Georgia and Alabama was the Muscogee confederacy (known during the colonial and federal periods as the Muscogee Creek tribe). They were among the Muskogean-speaking peoples of the Southeast.

They considered the ancient Mississippian mounds at Ocmulgee to be sacred and made pilgrimages there. According to Muscogee oral tradition, the mounds area was &quot;the place where we first sat down&quot;, after their ancestors ended their migration journey from the West.

In 1690, Scottish fur traders from Carolina built a trading post on Ochese Creek (Ocmulgee River), near the Macon Plateau mounds. Some Muscogee settled nearby, developing a village along the Ocmulgee River near the post, where they could easily acquire trade goods. They defied efforts by Spanish Florida authorities to bring them into the mission province of Apalachee.

The traders referred to both the river and the peoples living along it as &quot;Ochese Creek.&quot; Later usage shortened the term to Creek, which traders and colonists applied to all Muskogean-speaking peoples. The Muscogee called their village near the trading-post &quot;Ocmulgee&quot; (bubbling waters) in the local Hitchiti language. Carolina European colonists called it Ocmulgee Town, and later named the river after it. .

The Muscogee traded pelts of white tailed deer and Native American slaves captured in traditional raids against other tribes. They received West Indian rum, European cloth, glass beads, hatchets, swords, and flintlock rifles from the colonial traders. Carolinian fur traders, who were men of capital, took Muscogee wives, often the daughters of chiefs. It was a practice common also among European fur traders in Canada; both the fur traders and Aboriginal Canadians saw such marriages as a way to increase the alliances among the elite of both cultures. The fur traders encouraged the Muscogee slaving raids against Spanish &quot;Mission Indians.&quot; The English and Scots colonists were so few in number in the Carolina region that they depended on Native American alliances for security and survival.

In 1702, Carolina governor James Moore raised a militia of 50 colonists and 1,000 Yamasee and Ochese Creek warriors. From 1704 to 1706, they attacked and destroyed a significant number of Spanish missions in coastal Georgia and Florida. They captured numerous Indians who were referred to as Mission tribes: the Timucua and Apalachee. The colonists and some of their Indian allies sold their captives into slavery, with many being transported to Caribbean plantations. Together with extensive fatalities from epidemics of infectious diseases, the warfare caused Florida&#x27;s indigenous population to fall from about 16,000 in 1685 to 3,700 by 1715.

As Florida was depopulated, the English-allied tribes grew indebted to slave traders in Carolina. They paid other tribes to attack and enslave Native Americans, raids that were a catalyst for the Yamasee War in 1715. In an effort to drive the colonists out, the Ochese Creek joined the rebellion and burned the Ocmulgee trading post. In retaliation, the South Carolina authorities began arming the Cherokee, whose attacks forced the Ochese Creek to abandon the Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers, and move west to the Chattahoochee River. The Yamasee took refuge in Spanish Florida.

After the defeat of the Yamasee, former soldier James Oglethorpe established the colony of Georgia, founding the settlement of Savannah on the coast in 1733. Although various development schemes were attempted (silkworm cultivation, production of naval stores), the colony did not become profitable until after Georgia ended its prohibition of slavery. The founders had intended to provide a colony for hardworking yeomen laborers, but not enough people were willing to immigrate from England and bear its hard conditions. The colony began to import enslaved Africans as laborers and to develop the labor-intensive rice, cotton and indigo plantations in the 1750s in the Low Country and on the Sea Islands. These commodity crops, based on slave labor, generated the wealth of the planter class of Georgia and South Carolina.

Because of continuing conflicts with European colonists and other Muscogee groups, many Ochese Creek migrated from Georgia to Spanish Florida in the later 18th century. There they joined with earlier refugees of the Yamasee War, remnants of Mission Indians, and fugitive slaves, to form a new tribe which became known as the Seminole. They spoke mostly Muscogee.

=== Relations with the United States ===
The Ocmulgee mounds evoked awe in eighteenth-century travelers. The naturalist William Bartram journeyed through Ocmulgee in 1774 and 1776. He described the &quot;wonderful remains of the power and grandeur of the ancients in this part of America.&quot; Bartram was the first to record the Muscogee oral histories of the mounds&#x27; origins.

The Lower Creek of Georgia initially had good relations with the federal government of the United States, based on the diplomacy of both Benjamin Hawkins, President George Washington&#x27;s Indian agent, and the Muscogee Principal Chief Alexander McGillivray. McGillivray was the son of Sehoy II, a Muscogee woman of the Wind Clan, and Lachlan McGillivray, a wealthy Scottish fur trader. He achieved influence both within the matrilineal tribe, because of the status of his mother&#x27;s family, and among the Americans, because of his father&#x27;s position and wealth. McGillivray secured U.S. recognition of Muscogee and Seminole sovereignty by the Treaty of New York (1790).

But, after the invention of the cotton gin in 1794 made cultivation of short-staple cotton more profitable, Georgians were eager to acquire Muscogee corn fields of the uplands area to develop as cotton plantations; they began to encroach on the native territory. Short-staple cotton could be grown here, whereas Low Country plantations had to use long-staple cotton.

Under government pressure in 1805, the Lower Creek ceded their lands east of the Ocmulgee River to the state of Georgia, but they refused to surrender the sacred mounds. They retained a area on the east bank called the Ocmulgee Old Fields Reserve. It included both the mounds on the Macon Plateau and the Lamar mounds.

In 1806 the Jefferson administration ordered Fort Benjamin Hawkins to be built on a hill overlooking the mounds. The fort was of national and state military importance through 1821, used as a US Army command headquarters, and a supply depot for campaigns in the War of 1812 and later. Economically, it was important as a trading post, or United States factory, to regulate the Creek Nation&#x27;s trade in deerskins. In addition, it served as a headquarters and mustering area for the Georgia state militia. It served as a point of contact among the Creek Nation, the US, and the state of Georgia military and political representatives.

Tensions among the Upper Creek and Lower Creek towns increased with encroachment by European-American settlers in Georgia. Many among the Upper Creek wanted to revive traditional culture and religion, and a young group of men, the Red Sticks, formed around their prophets. The US and Georgia forces used the fort as a base during the Creek War of 1813–1814. At the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, General Andrew Jackson defeated the Red Stick faction of the Upper Creek. Together with their own issues, the Red Sticks had been influenced by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh and were seeking to drive the Americans out of their territory. The Lower Creek fought alongside the U.S. against the Red Sticks.

Led by Chief William McIntosh, the Lower Creek also allied with the United States in the First Seminole War in Florida. McIntosh&#x27;s influence in the area was extended by his family ties to Georgia&#x27;s planter elite through his wealthy Scots father of the same name. McIntosh was also connected to the McGillivray clan. A resident of Savannah, the senior McIntosh had strong ties to the British and had served as a Loyalist officer during the American Revolution. He tried to recruit the Lower Creek to fight for the British in the war. Remaining in the new United States after the war, he became a cotton planter.

In 1819, the Lower Creek gathered for the last time at Ocmulgee Old Fields. In 1821, Chief McIntosh agreed to the first Treaty of Indian Springs, by which the Lower Creek ceded their lands east of the Flint River, including Ocmulgee Old Fields, to the United States. In 1822 the state chartered Bibb County, and the following year the town of Macon was founded.

The Creek National Council struggled to end such land cessions by making them a capital offense. But in 1825, Chief McIntosh and his paternal cousin, Georgia Governor George Troup, negotiated an agreement with the US. McIntosh and several other Lower Creek chiefs signed the second Treaty of Indian Springs in 1825. McIntosh ceded the remaining Lower Creek lands to the United States, and the Senate ratified the treaty by one vote, despite its lacking the signature of Muscogee Principal Chief William McIntosh. Soon after that, the chief Menama and 200 warriors attacked McIntosh&#x27;s plantation. They killed him and burned down his mansion in retaliation for his alienating the communal lands.

William McIntosh and a Muscogee delegation from the National Council went to Washington to protest the treaty to President John Quincy Adams. The US government and the Creek negotiated a new treaty, called the Treaty of New York (1826), but the Georgia state government proceeded with evicting Creek from lands under the 1825 treaty. It also passed laws dissolving tribal government and regulating residency on American Indian lands.

In 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected president. He supported Indian removal, signing legislation to that effect by Congress in 1830. Later he used US Army forces to remove the remnants of the Southeastern Indian tribes through the 1830s. The Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and most of the Seminole, known as the Five Civilized Tribes, were all removed from the Southeast to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

Following Indian Removal, the Muscogee reorganized in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). In 1867 they founded a new capital, which they called &quot;Okmulgee&quot; in honor of their sacred mounds on the plateau of the Georgia fall line.
==National Historical Park==

=== Designations ===
While the mounds had been studied by some travelers, professional excavation under the evolving techniques of archeology did not begin until the 1930s, under the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) sponsored large-scale archaeological digs at the site between 1933 and 1942. Workers excavated portions of eight mounds, finding an array of significant archeological artifacts that revealed a wide trading network and complex, sophisticated culture. On June 14, 1934, the park was authorized by Congress as a national monument and formally established on December 23, 1936, under the National Park Service.

As an historic unit of the Park Service, the national monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1997, the NPS designated Ocmulgee Old Fields as a Traditional Cultural Property, the first such site named east of the Mississippi River.

The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019, redesignated it as a national historical park and increased its size by about 2,100 acres. It has an NPS-owned area of . The expanded area will be conveyed to the Park Service following redevelopment. 906 acres were transferred to the park on February 9, 2022, after negotiations headed by the Open Space Institute halted incompatible industrial development adjacent to the park; under the same deal, an additional 45 acres were transferred to the Ocmulgee Land Trust while wetlands restoration occurs, and will be transferred to the park at a later date.

=== Facilities ===
Ocmulgee&#x27;s visitor center includes an archaeology museum. It displays artifacts and interprets the successive cultures of the prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited this site for thousands of years. In addition, it interprets the historic Muscogee Creek tribe and the their diverse tribal towns who settled this region archaeologically and historically during the colonial era. The visitor center includes a short orientation film for the site. Its gift shop has a variety of craft goods, and books related to the park. In the early 1990s, the National Park Service renovated its facilities at the park.

The large park encompasses , and has of walking trails. Near the visitor center is a reconstructed ceremonial earthlodge, based on a 1,000-year-old structure excavated by archeologists. Visitors can reach the Great Temple Mound via a half-mile walk or the park road. Other surviving prehistoric features in the park include a burial mound, platform mounds, and earthwork trenches. The historic site of the English colonial trading post at Ocumulgee, when they were allied with the Muscogee, is also part of the park. It was discovered during archeological excavations in the 1930s.

The main section of Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park is accessible from U.S. Route 80, off Interstate 16 (which passes through the southwest edge of the park). It is open daily except Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Day.

The Lamar Mounds and Village Site is an isolated unit of the park, located in the swamps about south of Macon. The Lamar Site is open on a limited basis.

=== Potential expansion and redesignation as a national park and preserve ===
In 2022, the NPS conducted a Special Resource Study on the Ocmulgee River Corridor, which could have recommended expansion of the area as a national park and preserve. The study area includes parts of Bond Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, Robins Air Force Base, and three Georgia state wildlife management areas. The Muscogee Nation may be a partner in conservation management.

In November 2023, the study&#x27;s findings, which were sent to Congress, concluded that the Corridor proposal was unfeasible at the time due to estimated costs of acquisition, as well as opposition from landowners and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, but also assessed the Corridor as meeting criteria for &quot;national significance and suitability&quot; and recommended a scaled-down plan covering less land and operating as a public-private partnership (such as a National Heritage Area or National Historic Landmark designation) in association with the Muscogee Nation and other stakeholders. Despite the study&#x27;s findings and recommendations, Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Representatives Sanford Bishop and Austin Scott, whose districts covered the Ocmulgee River watershed in question, announced their intent to support the intended expansion.

<text>Florida State Prison (FSP), otherwise known as Raiford Prison, is a correctional institution located in unincorporated Bradford County, Florida, with a Raiford postal address. It was formerly known as the &quot;Florida State Prison-East Unit&quot; as it was originally part of Florida State Prison near Raiford (now known as Union Correctional Institution). The facility, a part of the Florida Department of Corrections, is located on State Road 16 right across the border from Union County. The institution opened in 1961, even though construction was not completed until 1968. With a maximum population of over 1,400 inmates, FSP is one of the largest prisons in the state. FSP houses Florida&#x27;s one of two male death row cell blocks and the State of Florida execution chamber. Union Correctional Institution also houses male death row inmates while Lowell Annex houses female death row inmates. Inmates however are moved to Florida State Prison for &quot;Death Watch&quot; after their death warrant is signed by the governor of the State of Florida to await execution.

Lethal injection became the standard method of execution in 2000. The electric chair can still be used by request of the inmate.

FSP sits in the center of several other prisons. It sits across the river from Union Correctional Institution and is surrounded by New River Correctional Institution, New River O-Unit, FSP West Unit, all of which are now closed. Even though Union Correctional Institution is on the same property, immediately north-west of FSP, the county line (with Union County) runs in between the two, which makes Raiford the United States Postal Service address city of Union Correctional Institution, while Starke is the USPS address city of Florida State Prison.

FSP is Florida&#x27;s only prison that is officially named &quot;prison&quot;, with the other institutions being named &quot;Correctional Institutions&quot; (or &quot;Correctional Facility&quot; if it is a privately contracted prison).

<doc id="1203555" wikidata="Q266582" url="?curid=1203555" title="Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania">
<text>The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (DAHR; , RMDSZ ; , UDMR) is a political party in Romania which aims to represent the significant Hungarian minority of Romania.

Officially considering itself a federation of minority interests rather than a party, from the 1990 general elections onwards the DAHR has had parliamentary representation in the Romanian Senate and Chamber of Deputies. From 1996 onwards the DAHR has been a junior coalition partner in several governments. It has been described as having close ties with Hungary’s socially-conservative longtime ruling Fidesz party and, implicitly, with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

The party is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party and Centrist Democrat International.

== History ==

The UDMR was founded on 25 December 1989, immediately after the fall of the Communist dictatorship in the Romanian Revolution of 1989 to represent in public the interests of the Hungarian community of Romania. Its first president was writer Géza Domokos during the early 1990s.

The UDMR obtained consistent results during the 1990, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and the 2012 elections, gaining representation in both houses of the Parliament, yet until 1996 the UDMR acted in opposition. From 1996 onwards, the party governed in a coalition with the Romanian Democratic Convention () (CDR)—a wide centre-right alliance that won the elections that year—and obtained some positions in the government of Victor Ciorbea.

Four years later, the opposition party, the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSD) won the 2000 elections. Although the UDMR did not join the new government as a coalition partner, it did sign a series of annual contracts with the PSD in which the PSD pledged to implement certain legal rights for the Hungarian minority community in return for UDMR&#x27;s endorsement in parliament.

In the 2004 elections, the UDMR made an alliance to back Adrian Năstase of the Social Democratic Party, who was the favourite to win the presidential elections, but the surprise victory of Traian Băsescu rocked the Romanian political spectrum. After negotiations, the UDMR, together with the Romanian Humanist Party (later to become the Conservative Party), defected from the PSD alliance and pledged to form a coalition with the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA). The UDMR obtained positions in the government.

After the 2008 legislative elections UDMR entered in opposition. In 2009, after the adoption of a motion of no confidence against the Emil Boc&#x27;s left and right grand coalition government, the UDMR became part of the new Emil Boc Cabinet, and continued after Emil Boc&#x27;s resignation as junior coalition partner of the Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu Cabinet together with the PDL and UNPR. In 2012 the Romanian Parliament voted a motion of no confidence against the Ungureanu Cabinet. After the formation of the Social Liberal Union (USL) government led by Victor Ponta, the UDMR entered the opposition.

After the 2012 elections the same parties continued to form a government under the leadership of Victor Ponta. In 2014 the liberal part of the party coalition left the government, while the UDMR, PC, and UNPR joined the new government. The UDMR left the government in December 2014, shortly after the landslide victory of Klaus Iohannis as President of Romania. Subsequently, the UDMR provided mostly confidence and supply agreements to other ruling majorities before becoming part of a grand coalition after December, 2020. After the resignation of the Ciucă Cabinet, UDMR withdrew from the coalition, after the National Liberals decided to take the Minister of Development, Public Works and Administration, which was held by UDMR in the Ciucă Cabinet.

==Party organisation==
===Status===
UDMR is not a legally registered political party, but takes part in elections under art. 4(2) of the Law 68/1992 which assimilates organizations representing national minorities to political parties from an electoral point of view. UDMR is an &quot;alliance&quot; of the ethnic Hungarian community in Romania, which incorporates several platforms of different ideologies, social, scientific, cultural or professional groups as associated organizations, youth and women organisations. The UDMR represents the Magyar (ethnic Hungarian) community of Romania (1,237,746 citizens, according to the 2011 census). Hungarians represent 18.9% of the total population of Transylvania; in Szeklerland (Harghita, Covasna and part of Mureș counties) they form the majority. The overwhelming majority (99%) of the Hungarian population of Romania lives in Transylvanian counties (Arad, Bistriţa-Năsăud, Bihor, Brașov, Alba, Harghita, Hunedoara, Cluj, Covasna, Caraș-Severin, Maramureș, Mureș, Satu Mare, Sibiu, Sălaj, Timiș). In national elections, the Alliance consistently obtains around 6% of the votes, which roughly corresponds to the percentage of ethnic Hungarian voters (6,5%).

===Structure===
The organization&#x27;s president is Hunor Kelemen, elected at a party congress in 2011. Béla Markó, a writer, had held the position from 1993. He in turn was preceded by founding president Géza Domokos, in office from 1990 to 1993.

The UDMR is structured into 22 territorial organizations, covering all regions of Transylvania, the capital Bucharest, several counties outside Transylvania, as well as platforms representing different political ideologies (Christian Democratic, Socialist, Liberal, National Liberal). It has several associated partners and groups representing the civil society, or the social, scientific, artistic or professional domains. As decision-making bodies, the UDMR operates the Congress, the Council of Representatives, the Permanent Council and the Presidency. The executive presidency is the executive body of the alliance. The consulting bodies of the alliance are: the Consulting Council of Regional Presidents, the Consulting Council of Platforms and the National Council of Self-governments. The bodies credited with controlling are the Regulation Control Committee, the Ethics and Disciplinary Committee. In addition, the President regularly convenes other consultative bodies such as the Economic Council and the Foreign Council.

===Doctrine===
As an ethnic minority organization representing the Hungarians of Romania, the UDMR, above all, concerns itself with Hungarian minority rights, including cultural and territorial autonomy.

The most important objectives of the UDMR are the preservation and development of the Hungarian community in Transylvania, the achievement of the different types of autonomy: cultural autonomy for the smaller and most vulnerable communities and the territorial autonomy and self-determination for those living in large majority area. The use of the mother tongue in all segments of private and public life, the education in mother tongue, the administration of all establishments in the area of minority education and culture are the most important elements of the daily struggle of the UDMR.

The alliance has undertaken the task of representing the interests of the Hungarian community of Romania in Romanian and European politics as well. Ever since its establishment, the formation advocated for the necessity of a united political life, one single voice, that expresses the goals of the Hungarian minority in Romania. This is based on the principle that, as a minority, the Transylvanian Hungarian community should politically be represented by a single, united organization that would offer a framework for varied ideologies and not by various political parties. The UDMR seeks to establish equal to equal relations with Romanian and European political actors expecting their support in pursuing the goals of the Hungarian community. The UDMR is convinced the Hungarian community in Romania is the only entity entitled to make decisions concerning the Hungarian community in Romania.

The UDMR focuses on cooperation and dialogue with the majority. Participating in the governing coalition is important as the alliance can greatly contribute through governmental means to the improvement of the life of the Hungarian community in Romania. The presence and role in the Romanian government of the UDMR protects the status and future of ethnic minorities in Romania and safeguards their evolution. The presence of the UDMR in the Romanian government is not limited to benefits in the field of Romanian politics: the fact bears an important message for states in the vicinity of Hungary, where ethical issues have lately appeared to be increasingly problematic. Since 1999 the UDMR has been a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), and since 1991 it is member of the Federal Union of European Nationalities (FUEN).

Various specific goals, gradually detailed during the years, include:

* Free use of mother tongue in private and public life, as well as in administration and justice;
* Development of a native-language school system, with all levels and all types of instruction;
* Full restitution of the community and Church-owned properties that were confiscated during the Communist regime;
* Autonomy and self governance for Szeklerland;
* Cultural autonomy for all national minorities in Romania (national minority law in the Romanian Parliament 2005);
* Decentralization of administration.

The UDMR leaders have claimed on several occasions that they believe local autonomy (decentralization) to be the most appropriate and efficient form of self-government. However, the UDMR has also stated that it wishes to achieve this goal only through a dialogue and consensus with the Romanian majority, and based on proven Western European models.

The UDMR has been criticized on several occasions for its lack of specific doctrine. The main argument for preserving the current structure is that if it split up into smaller fractions of different ideological orientations, it would be impossible for the Hungarian community to obtain more seats in the Parliament (one single seat is allocated to each minority group by default) due to the electoral threshold of 5%.

Several voices from within the UDMR and the Hungarian community have criticized it for being too moderate and making too many compromises in political treaties with other Romanian parties. The Hungarian Civic Alliance, formed by Hungarians against the UDMR, and the Hungarian People&#x27;s Party of Transylvania (PPMT) formed by former members of the UDMR aimed to form separate, more radical, political entities. However, during the 2004 and 2008 elections, the UDMR proved to still have the endorsement of the overwhelming majority of Hungarians. Disputes with this fraction group led to the departure of László Tőkés (who endorsed the PPMT) from the position of honorary president. In 2009 Tőkés joined, as frontrunner, the Hungarian Unity list for the European Parliamentary elections in Romania, but as elected Member of the European Parliament, he became an independent politician and resigned from his UDMR membership.

In 2022, the UDMR proposed an amendment to the Romanian Child Protection Law that would ban the discussion of homosexuality and gender identity in public spaces. The bill passed in the Senate of Romania in April 2022 and was approved by the Romanian Human Rights Commission but requires approval by Romania&#x27;s lower house of Parliament.

Despite the fact that UDMR maintains a moderate autonomist outlook, some politicians and pundits in Romania criticized several leading figures of the party as Hungarian nationalist, separatist, and anti-Romanian.

<doc id="1203556" wikidata="Q5574329" url="?curid=1203556" title="Gnom">
<text>gnom (gnome) was a Norwegian folk music band, the third band started by Janove Ottesen and Geir Zahl. Despite being relatively obsolete on the Norwegian musical scene, it is an important part of the creation of Kaizers Orchestra.

== History ==

After Ottesen and Zahl&#x27;s previous band, Blod Snått &amp; Juling, dissolved, Janove joined the army, where he wrote some songs that were recorded on a demo (known to fans as Janoves Soloprosjekt). Some of these songs wound up being recorded on the acoustic demo for the new band Janove and Geir started when they were together again, namely, gnom. Janove and Geir were soon joined by Helge Risa on pump organ, and Rune Solheim on drums (the two would later continue on as members of Kaizers Orchestra) and Rolf Prestø, known as &quot;Bestefar&quot;, (grandpa) on bass. gnom&#x27;s first, and only, release was &quot;Mys&quot; (1997), of which there were made 1000 copies, less than half of which were sold in the first year of its release. 

The band had to struggle to obtain any performance spots, and if one was available, the spectators were about 20, average. However, after the release of &quot;Mys&quot;, Janove wrote a song called &quot;Bastard&quot;, which had a very Tom Waits-esque sound to it, and for which the band utilized oil barrels as percussion. However, the band quickly began to dissolve due to lack of gigs and success. However, Ottesen decided to write songs in the same vein as &quot;Bastard&quot;, and as a result, he and Geir created a new band, known as Kaizers Orchestra.

Today, an original copy of &quot;Mys&quot; is a rare collector&#x27;s item, coveted by the fans of Kaizers Orchestra.

<doc id="1203562" wikidata="Q593304" url="?curid=1203562" title="Cyrus S. Eaton">
<text>Cyrus Stephen Eaton Sr. (December 27, 1883 – May 9, 1979) was a Canadian-American investment banker, businessman and philanthropist, with a career that spanned 70 years.

For decades Eaton was one of the most powerful financiers in the American Midwest, and he was a colourful and often-controversial figure. He was chiefly known for his longevity in business, for his opposition to the dominance of eastern financiers in the America of his day, for his occasionally ruthless financial manipulations, for his passion for world peace and for his outspoken criticism of United States Cold War policy. He funded and helped organize the first Pugwash Conferences on World Peace, in 1957. He wrote numerous articles and essays on political and economic subjects—&quot;Investment Banking: Competition or Decadence?&quot;, &quot;Rationalism Versus Rockefeller&quot;, and &quot;A Capitalist Looks at Labour&quot; being some of the best known.

==Life and career==
Eaton was born on December 27, 1883, on a farm near the village of Pugwash in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Besides farming, his father, Joseph Howe Eaton, ran a small general store and the district post office. Cyrus&#x27;s uncle was Charles Aubrey Eaton who led a Cleveland congregation that included Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Sr. who Cyrus Eaton met in 1901 when he was 17 and later became his &quot;protégé&quot; after Rockefeller hired the young Eaton to be a messenger in Rockefeller&#x27;s private telegraph room.

Eaton left Nova Scotia in 1899 to attend Woodstock College, a Baptist-affiliated prep school in Woodstock, Ontario. Later he enrolled at McMaster University, a Baptist university, then located in Toronto, where he studied philosophy and finance, intending to enter the Baptist ministry. He earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1905 with a major in philosophy.
After graduating from McMaster he moved to Cleveland and went to work for the East Ohio Gas Company. This was one of many businesses associated with John D. Rockefeller. After working with East Ohio Gas and Rockefeller for two years, he established his own business in 1907, developing gas utilities which at the time were relatively underdeveloped and unconsolidated in Canada. He managed to secure natural-gas franchises in Manitoba, Canada, representing a group of New York investors. The syndicate was unable to complete its financing and went defunct. However, the Manitoba government was sufficiently impressed to allow Eaton to retain the franchises. Eaton formed a new holding company, the Canada Gas &amp; Electric Corp, later consolidated into the Continental Gas &amp; Electric Corp. in 1913.

After spending several years travelling, Eaton settled in Cleveland in 1913 and became active in many businesses. Eaton joined the Otis &amp; Co. banking firm in 1916. In 1926 he established the investment vehicle Continental Shares, Inc., a closed end trust. In 1927 he formed Republic Steel, the 3rd-largest U.S. steel company. His business had a complex structure which some felt to be too highly leveraged. His 1929 wealth was an estimated $100 million, most of which was lost in the Great Depression.

Eaton rebuilt his fortune in the 1940s and 1950s, becoming a director (1943), then board chairman (1954), of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, and also board chairman of the West Kentucky Coal Co. (1953).

Eaton married twice. 
First, in 1907, Margaret House (1887-1956); then Anne Kinder Jones (1922-1992) in 1957. He had seven children: Margaret Grace, Mary Adelle, Elizabeth Ann, Anna Bishop, Cyrus S. Jr., Augusta Farlee, and MacPherson.

==Tower International==
To effect the trading of sheet metal from Eaton&#x27;s Republic Steel in Cleveland for chrome ore primarily from the Kazakh SSR in the Soviet Union in 1954 during the United States&#x27; McCarthyism era, Eaton&#x27;s son Cyrus Eaton Jr., established the Canadian firm Tower International in Montreal because direct trade between the US and the Soviet Union was unthinkable. In the early 1960s, Tower International proposed building numerous buildings in central Moscow including four skyscrapers which would house Moscow&#x27;s International Trade Center, an eighteen hole golf course, a 600-room hotel, a 2,000-seat conference centre, numerous restaurants, apartments for foreigners, and an office complex. In early 1969, Armand Hammer obtained control of Tower International through which Hammer would have a controlling majority stake in Tower International in exchange for Hammer&#x27;s Occidental Petroleum assuming the debts of Tower International and Eaton receiving 45% of any profits from Tower International&#x27;s future projects. In July 1972, Armand Hammer&#x27;s financial wizard Dorman Commons, who was the chief financial officer at Occidental Petroleum in Los Angeles, estimated that the Moscow International Trade Center project would cost $100 million and would be a complete flop if détente failed. On July 31, 1972, Commons voiced his thoughts with Hammer after which Hammer fired Commons effective August 1, 1972. During détente in July 1972, Armand Hammer negotiated a 20-year agreement with Brezhnev of the Soviet Union that was signed by Hammer in April 1973 in which the Hammer controlled firms Occidental Petroleum and Tower International would export to the Soviet Union, and later Russia, phosphate, which Occidental mined in northern Florida, in return for the Soviet Union, and later Russia, exporting to Hammer&#x27;s firms natural gas that would be converted into ammonia, potash, and urea. This fertilizer deal was to continue until Hammer&#x27;s 100th birthday in 1998. JaxPort at the Port of Jacksonville in Jacksonville, Florida, was the United States port through which this trade occurred.

==Philanthropy==

In 1920, Eaton founded the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

The Russell–Einstein Manifesto was issued in London on July 9, 1955, by Bertrand Russell in the midst of the Cold War. It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven preeminent intellectuals and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist Eaton offered to sponsor a conference (called for in the manifesto) in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Eaton&#x27;s birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, held in July 1957.

Besides financial support for the Pugwash Conferences, Eaton provided funds to support education in Nova Scotia, particularly in Pugwash and to Acadia University. He supported the establishment of a game sanctuary in Nova Scotia on the Aspotogan Peninsula (his summer home was in Blandford, Nova Scotia where he had his ashes buried). He donated money for the doors of St. Bartholmus Church in Blandford and 12 acres (4.9 hectares) of land in Northfield, Ohio, for the Lee Eaton Elementary School, named in memory of his daughter. He was also a financial supporter of McMaster University, the YWCA, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and Case Western Reserve University. Upon his death in 1979, his Blandford estate was purchased by a group of businessmen from Germany. His summer home was destroyed in a fire in 2015.

===Awards===
Eaton&#x27;s 1950s efforts at rapprochement with the Soviet Union won him the 1960 Lenin Peace Prize. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, and was the recipient of an honorary degree from Bowling Green State University in 1969. The Pugwash Conferences and their chairman, Joseph Rotblat, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995.

==Death==

Eaton died on May 9, 1979, at his home, Acadia Farm, in Northfield, Ohio. He had his ashes buried in Blandford, Nova Scotia.

<text>The Fixer is the name of two characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics: Roscoe Sweeney and Paul Norbert Ebersol.

Roscoe Sweeney was portrayed by Kevin Nagle in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series &quot;Daredevil&quot; while Paul Norbert Ebersol has appeared in animated media.

==Publication history==
The first Marvel Comics character known as the Fixer was Roscoe Sweeney. He first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #1 (Apr. 1964), and was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Bill Everett.

The second iteration of Fixer was long-time supervillain Paul Norbert Ebersol, first appearing in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #141 (February 1966) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Much later, he appeared as a regular character in &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, until he was forced to leave the team.

==Fictional character biography==
===Roscoe Sweeney===
Roscoe Sweeney was a gangster and crooked fight promoter who was involved in extortion and illegal gambling who operated as the &quot;Fixer&quot;. He paid boxer &quot;Battling Jack&quot; Murdock to take a fall and lose a fight. Murdock accepted the money, however, the boxer became determined to continue the fight and eventually won by a knockout. The Fixer&#x27;s right-hand man Slade killed Jack after the fight in retaliation. Learning of his father&#x27;s murder and vowing to bring men like the Fixer to justice, Matt Murdock became a lawyer as well as the superhero Daredevil. The Fixer and Slade went to Fogwell&#x27;s Gym where they encountered Daredevil. When the Fixer and Slade ran for it upon their being disarmed, Daredevil pursued them into the subway station. After the Man Without Fear tripped Slade, the Fixer had a fatal heart attack when confronted by Daredevil and died. As the Fixer&#x27;s body fell onto the subway tracks, the Man Without Fear stopped a subway from running over the Fixer&#x27;s body. Slade was arrested and sentenced to death by the electric chair.

===Paul Norbert Ebersol===
Paul Norbert Ebersol was born in Dayton, Ohio. He was a scientist who held a number of odd jobs, including auto mechanic, television repairman, and electronics laboratory assistant. He then became the second and more prominent &quot;Fixer&quot;, a supervillain and genius-level criminal inventor who has often worked for criminal cartels like HYDRA.

In his first appearance, he escaped from prison, teamed with his partner Mentallo in an attempted takeover of the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, and even captured Nick Fury. Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. troops. His connection with THEM was revealed; and THEM was later revealed as part of HYDRA. Behind the scenes, he was even revealed as the chief of the HYDRA Science Division.

With Mentallo, the Fixer later escaped prison again. They invaded the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters and captured the Thing. They then invaded the Baxter Building, battled the Thing and Nick Fury, and used Doctor Doom&#x27;s time machine to bring Deathlok from his alternate future. Mentallo then mind-controlled Deathlok in an attempted assassination of the U.S. president, but Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by the Fantastic Four and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. The pair was freed from prison by a HYDRA force controlled by Baron Karza. Fixer created the living machine-intelligence Computrex, which was destroyed by the Micronauts who then defeated Fixer and Mentallo.

Fixer and Mentallo then aided Professor Power in his attempt to add Professor X&#x27;s powers to Mentallo&#x27;s, but they were defeated by Spider-Man. Fixer attempted to loot Northwind Observatory of Bruce Banner&#x27;s inventions, but was captured by Captain America. Fixer then invaded the West Coast Avengers Compound in an attempt to steal Iron Man&#x27;s armor, but was defeated by Iron Man and Ka-Zar.

When Baron Helmut Zemo formed the fourth incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Fixer served as his right-hand man. When the Masters of Evil invaded Avengers Mansion, Fixer created a device enabling Baron Zemo to control Blackout. Fixer helped engineer the capture of Captain America, Black Knight, and Edwin Jarvis. Fixer was apprehended by Ant-Man. Behind the scenes, Fixer was overpowered by the Super-Adaptoid which changed places with him. The Super-Adaptoid disguised as the Fixer later escaped prison. The real Fixer was discovered by the Avengers in the android&#x27;s former confinement tube at Avengers Island. Fixer later escaped prison with Yellowjacket who then spurned his romantic advances. The Fixer followed Yellowjacket and battled Yellowjacket and the Black Knight before escaping.

In Zemo&#x27;s second incarnation of the Masters of Evil, the team changed their identity to the Thunderbolts, while Fixer adopted the alias of Techno. He was then apparently killed when his neck was broken by Iron, one of the Elements of Doom, and he transferred his mind into a robotic body, and this Techno sided, alone among the Thunderbolts, with Zemo when he went ahead with his scheme to conquer the planet.

Zemo and Techno decamped to one of Zemo&#x27;s bases, where Techno began to experiment with cloning, offering to clone Zemo an unscarred body, and even cloning Kevin Costner for fun at one point. After the two fell out, Techno infiltrated the Thunderbolts by replacing Ogre, while continuing his experiments behind-the-scenes, including recovering Jolt&#x27;s body when she was killed and placing it in a healing tube.

Techno&#x27;s impersonation of Ogre ended when Scourge of the Underworld stowed away inside him, shrunken, and destroyed his body from the inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again to allow him to construct a new body. However, his backup plan worked, and his consciousness was returned to his original human body—mostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage—and the human Ebersol, initially amnesiac of the robot&#x27;s exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer.

Fixer then became one of the Redeemers, a government-backed team whereby criminals could use it to accelerate their sentences and clear their record until most of that team was slaughtered by Graviton. He joined with the reunited Thunderbolts to stop Graviton, and he was one of the team members exiled to Counter-Earth. By a complicated series of events, at the end of the trip to Counter-Earth, Zemo&#x27;s consciousness ended up in Fixer&#x27;s tech-pac. By threatening to disable it and leave him quadriplegic, Zemo managed to force Fixer to transfer the Baron&#x27;s consciousness to his Counter-Earth counterpart&#x27;s body.

The team remained on Counter-Earth for some time, until, in sealing a rift, they returned home, leaving Jolt (whom Fixer saved from burning out in helping to seal the rift) behind. Finally, after Moonstone went insane, Fixer furnished a device that could give the combined Avengers and Thunderbolts a couple of seconds to make their move; he then left.

Later, Deadpool visited Fixer at his holiday home to enlist his help in saving Cable. After a brief fight, Fixer accepted the challenge (and Deadpool&#x27;s monetary inducement), and successfully bonded new, benign, techno-organic mesh to Cable. Sometime after this, Fixer suddenly reappeared to save his former teammate MACH-IV from a fall. Fixer recruited MACH-IV to join a secretive group headed by Zemo to combat and destroy Genis-Vell, a member of the Thunderbolts whom Zemo had brought back to life. The process was flawed, however, and Genis&#x27; existence now threatened the universe.

After Genis was destroyed, Fixer remained with the Thunderbolts, who were now helmed by Zemo. He helped the team recruit supervillains to the pro-registration cause during the Civil War. He also helped Zemo save the Wellspring of Power from the Grandmaster. After Zemo was betrayed and the Thunderbolts were placed under S.H.I.E.L.D. control, Fixer and MACH-IV were offered jobs with the Commission on Superhuman Activities.

Ebersol has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book.

During the &quot;Heroic Age&quot; storyline, Fixer works as the Raft&#x27;s supervisor in its section for male supervillains when Captain Steve Rogers and Luke Cage arrive to recruit Ghost. As well as working with the Thunderbolts, Fixer has also been seen working with Baron Zemo.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Fixer was seen working on a forcefield to secure the rounded-up prisoners who had escaped from the Raft after Juggernaut, in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, leveled it.

After escaping the Raft by time-traveling, the Thunderbolts wound up meeting their counterparts - the first Thunderbolts team. Being as arrogant as they are, present-Fixer and past-Fixer got into an argument in which Fixer impulsively killed his past self. To preserve the timeline, Fixer surgically changed himself to restore his younger appearance and preserved his age by a blood-transfusion from Centurius. Fixer and the past Thunderbolts&#x27; memories were wiped, stranding Fixer in a stable time-loop and preserving the timeline after his mistake.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Fixer resurfaces where is shown to be a prisoner of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-established gated community Pleasant Hill where Kobik, fragments of a Cosmic Cube transformed into a nigh-omnipotent child, turned him into a mild-mannered mechanic named Phil. Phil was able to see through this and arranged a meet-up with a man named Jim. Upon showing the training video he stole that featured the details about Pleasant Hill by Mayor Maria Hill to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Cadets, Phil used the machine he invented to turn himself back into Fixer and Jim back into Baron Helmut Zemo. Both of them vowed to use the device on the other brainwashed supervillains and reduce Pleasant Hill to dust. Fixer and Baron Zemo began to restore the memories of the other inmates one by one. Fixer later invented a device that would help Baron Zemo and his fellow villains find Kobik.

Following the Pleasant Hill incident, Fixer joined up with Winter Soldier&#x27;s incarnation of the Thunderbolts with the goal to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. from continuing the Kobik Project.

At the time when Baron Zemo formed the fourth incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Fixer joined the Thunderbolts into fighting them which ends with the Thunderbolts being defeated.

During the &quot;Opening Salvo&quot; part of the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Fixer defected to the Masters of Evil after Winter Soldier was sent back in time to World War II and Kobik had shattered. While Atlas and Moonstone worked to gather Kobik&#x27;s pieces, Fixer maintained the inventory of the pieces he has with Erik Selvig. Fixer was later present when Baron Helmut Zemo is advised by the Kobik-reprogrammed Captain America into having the Masters of Evil be part of the Army of Evil.

==Powers and abilities==
The second version of Fixer is an intuitive genius at the invention of weapons and other electrical and mechanical devices. He has designed numerous devices and paraphernalia for himself, including his body armor. As for weaponry, he has used various devices including bombs, electronic jamming devices, guided missiles, sonic amplifiers, brain-wave scanners, and mind-control pods. He has also built anti-gravity discs which are affixed to his feet and allow flight at the speed of sound, as well as a special mask that contains a three-hour air supply and acts as an air pressure reduction valve, together with enabling flight at high velocity and high altitude. Fixer&#x27;s Techno body can mentally control his robotic body which is capable of assuming virtually any form from blast cannons to pile-drivers to even the form of a space station. To take on larger shapes, Techno physically absorbed the mass of other mechanical materials nearby into himself. Techno&#x27;s body also could morph into forms that appeared completely organic, as with his assumed guise of Thunderbolt machine-smith Ogre.

<text>The Australian grayling (Prototroctes maraena) is a primarily freshwater fish found in coastal rivers in south-eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania. In past decades it has also been known as the cucumber mullet or cucumber herring, for its cucumber-like odour.

==Description and diet==
The Australian grayling is a streamlined fish with a long and slender body and small conical head. Colouration is usually silver on the flanks and dusky olive on the back, overlain with a gold sheen.

Australian grayling commonly live for 2–3 years and reach around in length, although rare individuals have been recorded up to at least 5 years in age and in length. The fish has an omnivorous diet, feeding upon algae, shrimp, and small insects. They have specially adapted teeth and a long gut to help with the digestion of algae.

==Reproduction==
Australian grayling spawn following movements to the lower freshwater reaches of coastal rivers. Spawning is thought to occur in late autumn or early winter. McDowall (1996) reports that egg counts range from 25,000 to 67,000 in females 170–200 mm long, and that the small (~1 mm) demersal eggs probably settle among gravel and cobble in the river bed before hatching. Hatched larvae are washed out to sea. Australian grayling juveniles return to the freshwater reaches of rivers after roughly 6 months at sea and spend the rest of their lives in river habitats.

==Angling==
Before the introduction of alien (&quot;introduced&quot;) fish species including the Eastern mosquitofish and trout to Australian waterways the Australian grayling and spotted galaxias were keenly fished by recreational anglers using fly-fishing gear. The species was appreciated for its willingness to take wet and dry flies, its excellent fighting ability on very light tackle, and its relatively large size. However, due to declining numbers the fish is now protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Heavy penalties apply for taking any of the fish.

==Historical declines and current threats==
Australian grayling suffered massive initial declines in 1868–70 through very large, unexplained fish kills (Saville-Kent, 1888). Australian grayling killed in these events are described as being covered in &quot;cottony growths&quot;, a characteristic hallmark of the alien fungus-like oomycete &quot;Saprolegnia parasitica&quot;; these kills likely mark the arrival of this alien pathogen in Australian freshwater habitats via the importation, culturing and stocking of alien salmonid (trout) species.

Saville-Kent then went on to consider the apparent epidemic some 17–18 years previously which had caused the demise of the Australian grayling &quot;Prototroctes maraena&quot;. The grayling were said to &quot;have been seen floating down the rivers in thousands, covered more or less extensively with a cottony fungoid growth. So virulent and exhaustive was this epidemic that many, more especially of the southern rivers, were more or less completely denuded of their stock of this species and have so remained up to the present date&quot;. Saville-Kent posed the questions of how, when and where the epidemic originated and whether at the time there were any abnormal conditions associated with the rivers carrying the infected fish. He went on to say: &quot;The approximate date of the appearance of this epidemic would appear to be about the year 1869 or 1870, periods it may be remarked of great activity in association with the distribution of the fry of the newly acclimatised Salmonidae in the rivers of this colony. Is it possible ... that the fungus, &quot;Saprolegnia&quot;, was hitherto unknown to Tasmania and was introduced with the ova of these Salmonidae, or more probably in the moss wherein they were packed? Under such conditions the germs or spores, like the microbes of measles or smallpox, arriving on a virgin and congenial soil, might be expected to spread with devastating virulence among the aboriginal inhabitants.&quot;

Australian grayling is threatened by a number of factors. Dams and weirs block migration and also block floods and reduce base flows, both of which are important for habitat maintenance and for spawning and movement of grayling larvae and juveniles to and from the sea. Irresponsible forestry and farming practices degrade and fragment river environments through siltation and other effects. Alien trout species threaten grayling through predation and competition. Scientific studies have shown native fish species similar in habitat and lifestyle such as spotted galaxias are severely depressed in number in rivers inhabited by alien trout species (Ault &amp; White 1994), and are forced into sub-optimal feeding locations, feeding times and diets by aggressive competition from alien trout species. A chronic lack of alien-trout-free habitat reserved for galaxias, grayling and other native fish species in south-eastern Australia generally is a major concern.

Two Australian grayling were observed in the Glenelg River in south-western Victoria in early 2021, the first recorded sighting since 1899. Scientists think that some of the environmental degradation caused after agriculture was introduced into the area was being reversed, and the health of the river and estuary has improved enough for the fish to make a comeback.

Australian grayling are listed as a vulnerable species under Australia&#x27;s &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; and under the IUCN Red List. There are now a number of conservation measures focused on conserving the fish.

<text>Prescriptivity is a term used in meta-ethics to state that when an evaluative judgment or decision is made it must either prescribe or condemn. The word implies that these judgments (and the prescription and condemnation) logically commit us to certain ways of living. Contrary to popular opinion, prescriptivity does not just describe or categorize decisions - for example, &quot;you ought to do this&quot; (used evaluatively) logically entails the imperative &quot;do this.&quot;

==Universal Prescriptivism==
Prescriptivity is one of the five (prescriptivity, universalizability, overridingness, publicity, and practicability) axioms of Formal Ethics. When combined with Universalizability, prescriptivity becomes Universal prescriptivism. Universal prescriptivism combines these two methods of thinking, combining evaluative judgments (which commit us to making similar judgments about similar cases) and prescription and condemnation when the judgment is at last made. This enables us to think in a very powerful and rational way about ethical and moral issues.

<text>María de la Soledad Teresa O&#x27;Brien (born September 19, 1966) is an American broadcast journalist and executive producer. Since 2016, O&#x27;Brien has been the host for &quot;Matter of Fact with Soledad O&#x27;Brien,&quot; a nationally syndicated weekly talk show produced by Hearst Television. She is chairwoman of Starfish Media Group, a multiplatform media production company and distributor that she founded in 2013. She is also a member of the Peabody Awards board of directors, which is presented by the University of Georgia&#x27;s Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.

O&#x27;Brien co-anchored CNN&#x27;s &quot;American Morning&quot; from 2003 to 2007, and was the anchor of CNN&#x27;s morning news program &quot;Starting Point&quot; from 2012 to 2013. In 2013, O&#x27;Brien became special correspondent on the Al Jazeera America news program &quot;America Tonight,&quot; and was also a correspondent on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; until the show&#x27;s final episode in December 2023.

== Early life and education ==

O&#x27;Brien was born and raised in St. James, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island to Edward Ephrem O&#x27;Brien (d. 2019), a mechanical engineering professor at Stony Brook University, and Estela O&#x27;Brien (née Marquetti y Mendieta) (d. 2019), a French and English teacher at Smithtown High School West. Her parents were both immigrants and met while they were students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Her father is from Toowoomba, Queensland, in Australia and is of three quarters Irish and one quarter Scottish descent. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s mother is from Havana, Cuba, and is of Afro-Cuban descent. When she was 14 years old, she came to the United States, sponsored by Oblate Sisters of Providence of Maryland.

Interracial marriage was illegal in Maryland before 1967, so in 1958 O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s parents married in Washington, D.C., where marriage laws were less restrictive. The newly wedded O&#x27;Briens then moved to Long Island, to the town of St. James. O&#x27;Brien is the fifth of six children, all graduates of Harvard College. Her siblings are law professor Maria O&#x27;Brien (born 1960), GE corporate lawyer Cecilia Vega (born 1961), businessman Tony O&#x27;Brien (born 1962), who heads a documents company, eye surgeon Estela Ogiste (born 1964), and anesthesiologist Orestes O&#x27;Brien (born 1967). Her niece is journalist Antonia Hylton.

O&#x27;Brien graduated from Smithtown High School East in 1984. She attended Radcliffe College from 1984 to 1988, starting as pre-med and English and American literature, but left to take a job at WBZ-TV. O&#x27;Brien went back to school while pregnant with her first child and earned her degree from Harvard in English and American Literature in 2000.

== Career ==
O&#x27;Brien started her career in journalism as a medical reporter on WXKS-FM in Boston because of her background as a pre-med student in college.

=== NBC and MSNBC (1991–2003) ===
O&#x27;Brien began her career as an associate producer and news writer at WBZ-TV, then the NBC affiliate in Boston. She joined NBC News in 1991 and was based in New York as a field producer for the &quot;Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Weekend Today&quot;. She then worked for three years as a local reporter and bureau chief for San Francisco&#x27;s then-NBC affiliate KRON-TV. At KRON she was a reporter on &quot;The Know Zone.&quot;

Starting in 1996 and during the dot-com boom, O&#x27;Brien anchored MSNBC&#x27;s weekend morning show and the cable network&#x27;s technology program &quot;The Site&quot;, which aired weeknights from the spring of 1996 to November 1997. The show was unique in that she interacted with a virtual character named Dev Null, played by Leo Laporte in a motion-capture suit.

From July 1999 to July 2003, O&#x27;Brien was co-anchor of the NBC News program, &quot;Weekend Today&quot; with

During that time she contributed reports for the weekday &quot;Today Show&quot; and for weekend editions of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. She also covered such notable stories as John F. Kennedy Jr.&#x27;s plane crash and the 1990s school shootings in Colorado and Oregon.

=== Warner Bros. Discovery (2003–present) ===
====CNN: &quot;American Morning&quot; (2003–2007) ====
O&#x27;Brien moved to CNN, where from July 2003 to April 2007, she was co-anchor of the CNN program, &quot;American Morning&quot; CNN&#x27;s flagship morning program that aired live from New York City.

==== CNN: &quot;Starting Point&quot; (2012–2013) ====
From January 2012 to March 2013, O&#x27;Brien was anchor of the CNN program, &quot;Starting Point.&quot; After CNN canceled &quot;American Morning&quot; and replaced it with two new programs, &quot;Early Start&quot; and &quot;Starting Point&quot; in 2011, O&#x27;Brien began anchoring &quot;Starting Point&quot; on January 2, 2012. It was announced on February 21, 2013, that O&#x27;Brien had reached an agreement with CNN to leave &quot;Starting Point&quot; for the new Starfish Media Group production company.

In &quot;The Black Woman &amp; Family&quot;, O&#x27;Brien explored the varied experiences of black women and families and investigated the disturbing statistics of single parenthood, racial disparities between students, and the devastating toll of HIV/AIDS. The fifth installment of the &quot;Black in America&quot; series aired in December 2012.

As an Adviser to the summit, O&#x27;Brien stated she had made it her mission to ensure that the event isn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be lip service without action and outlined plans for future events.

Albright attended William Penn Charter School. A forward early in his career, Albright played college soccer at the University of Virginia for two years; he was named an All-American in 1999.

==Club career==
Considered one of the best attacking prospects in the country, he leveraged foreign interest into getting assigned to D.C. United, despite the club being low on MLS&#x27;s pecking order for Project-40 players. The league forced a trade with the Miami Fusion for future considerations, which turned out to be Roy Lassiter, but not until both Albright and Lassiter helped DC to the 1999 MLS Cup.

But Albright&#x27;s club career did not live up to the lofty expectations. He struggled to find the back of the net, scoring just four goals total in his first three years in the league. D.C. dealt him to Los Angeles Galaxy for a draft pick prior to the 2002 season.

Albright drifted further onto the midfield, and then found himself in the back as the Galaxy&#x27;s starting right defender for the 2003 and 2004 seasons. With Los Angeles Albright became one of the league&#x27;s top right-backs, and was honored as an MLS Best XI selection in 2005. During his time with the Galaxy he helped the club capture two MLS Cup and one U.S. Open Cup title. He appeared in 116 league matches, scoring 7 goals.

On January 18, 2008, Albright was traded to New England Revolution in return for allocation money. During the 2008 season Albright was a fixture for New England at right-back appearing in 26 league matches; however during the 2009 season he suffered a season-ending injury that limited him to only one appearance.

Albright was traded to New York Red Bulls on January 14, 2010, in exchange for picks #31 and #48 in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft. After beginning the 2010 season on injured reserve Albright regained his form and became the club&#x27;s starting right-back and helped New York capture the regular season Eastern Conference title.

Following the 2011 season, the Red Bulls declined the 2012 option on Albright&#x27;s contract, making him eligible for the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Albright was not selected in the draft and became a free agent.

On February 13, 2012, Albright signed to play for his hometown Philadelphia Union. He retired at the conclusion of the 2013 season

==International career==
Albright&#x27;s first attempt at playing defense came with United States national team coach Bruce Arena, who gave him his first cap on September 8, 1999, against Jamaica. Albright scored his lone U.S. goal that day and has accumulated 21 caps as of 2007.

Albright was listed as an alternate for Bruce Arena&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and made the final squad two days after the initial roster announcement due to the injury of Frankie Hejduk. Albright did not appear in a match in the tournament.

===International goals===
==Post playing career==
In January 2014, Albright was announced as joining the Philadelphia Union&#x27;s technical staff as assistant technical director. His responsibilities would focus on assisting in player management and movement along with player and coaching decisions.

In October 2021, FC Cincinnati announced Albright had been hired as the new general manager of the club.

<text>[[KwaZulu-Natal]] is one of the most diverse provinces in South Africa in terms of its fauna and flora. Many of its wide variety of ecosystems have been preserved as parks and reserves, which are popular tourist attractions. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife is a governmental agency that maintains the wildlife conservation areas in the province.  

KwaZulu-Natal is home to some of the most popular game reserves and national parks in Africa. But, the province also extends 360 miles (580 kilometers) along the coast. This means that it offers a combination of inland game viewing, deep-sea fishing, SCUBA diving and snorkeling.

== Public game parks and nature reserves ==
These are just some of the game parks and nature reserves in KwaZulu-Natal that are open to the public:

* Royal Natal National Park

** Mkuze Game Reserve
* Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve – the oldest national park in Africa.
* Itala Game Reserve
* Phinda Resource Reserve
* uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park (part of the Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area)
* Oribi Gorge
* Empisini Nature Reserve
* Krantzkloof Nature Reserve
* New Germany Nature Reserve

== Wildlife ==
The main attraction to these parks and reserves is the wildlife species that can be found within them. These are best enjoyed on guided game drives and safaris, where a guide can provide information on the local predators, prey, fauna and flora.

South Africa is known for the Big 5, which comprises lion, elephant, rhinoceros, Cape buffalo and leopard. Other exciting species include the hippopotamus, giraffe, hyena, zebra, warthog, kudu and African wild dog. This area is also renowned for its wide array of birds. These include the martial eagle, secretarybird, African pygmy kingfisher, lilac-breasted roller and many more.

== Tourism ==
The game parks and reserves of KwaZulu-Natal are a major draw-card for tourists from all over South Africa and the world. This province also has an excellent infrastructure. Durban is its main metropolis and is home to the King Shaka International Airport.

<text>Miklós Németh (born 23 October 1946) is a Hungarian Olympic champion and former world record holder in the javelin throw. Born in Budapest, he is the son of Imre Németh, who won the Olympic gold in the hammer throw at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Németh&#x27;s winning effort at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal was also a world record, 94.58m in the first round. Silver medalist Hannu Siitonen of Finland, whose record of 93.90m was set in June, achieved 87.92m — more than 6.5m (nearly 22 feet) behind Németh. The new champion was elected Hungarian Sportsman of the Year for his achievement.

Németh&#x27;s gold medal world-record performance stood until 23 April 1980, when fellow Hungarian Ferenc Paragi launched the spear 96.72m.

<doc id="1203585" wikidata="Q7685280" url="?curid=1203585" title="Taradale, New Zealand">
<text>Taradale is a suburb of the City of Napier, in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region of the North Island of New Zealand. It is a predominantly middle-upper class residential suburb, located 10 kilometres southwest of the centre of Napier. The Taradale ward, which includes Greenmeadows, Meeanee, and Poraiti, had a population of 22,809 in the 2018 New Zealand census.

For hundreds of years, hills overlooking what is now Taradale were the site of villages occupied by Māori people, latterly of the Ngāti Kahungunu tribe. Europeans started settling at Taradale in the 1850s, and it was officially recognised as a town in 1886. It was a town district from 1886 to 1953, and a borough from 1953 to 1968, when it merged with Napier City. The Taradale area is home to some of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest and finest vineyards and wineries, with a wine-making heritage dating back to the 1850s.

==History==

=== Early Māori history ===
Several hundred years ago there was a large Māori pā (fortified settlement) on the hills at the southern edge of what is now Taradale. Originally a double pā, the top part was called Hikurangi and the bottom Ōtātara. Occupied by a tribe known as Tini-o-Awa or Ngāti Awa, the pā terraces enclosed about 100 hectares and were home to around 3,000 Māori. The pā was on an excellent defensive site beside the Tutaekuri River, which was navigable by canoe from the sea. Food was plentiful, the hillsides were suitable for kūmara growing and much of the area was a large tidal location with fish, eels and shellfish.

The pā was attacked early in the 16th century by the Ngāti Kahungunu tribe under chiefs Taraia and Rakai-hiku-roa. They came from Tūranga, near what is now Gisborne, and defeated the Hikurangi pā. Unable to take Ōtātara at that time, Taraia set up a new pā at Pākōwhai. Some time later he organised another war party and again besieged Ōtātara. Legend has it that Taraia waited until the defenders were short of food. He then left, leaving a small party concealed near a patch of fern. The defenders sent two men out to dig for fern roots. They were ambushed then killed and their places taken by two of Taraia&#x27;s men. When the defenders saw the men digging they thought them to be from Ōtātara so they opened up the pā and went out to help. Taraia&#x27;s men attacked and killed many of the local Māori. The pā then collapsed and was abandoned.

Over the years marriages took place between local Māori and Ngāti Kahungunu and peace was restored. Today the Ōtātara pā site has become a memorial to the Māori who were so prevalent in the area many years ago.

=== Early European history ===
Taradale has a rich heritage stemming from its key role as the original gateway to the inland routes (including Taupō, Auckland and Taihape) and to the farms and settlements of its hinterland.

In 1851 Donald McLean purchased, on behalf of the Crown, the Ahuriri Block, which included present-day Taradale and Greenmeadows. By the mid-1850s settlers began flocking to the province. The census held in 1856 showed that in Hawke&#x27;s Bay there were 1057 males and 458 females. The government purchased the Tutaekuri Block in 1856, which was subdivided, with Ahuriri Block, as the river Meeanee District and released for sale in April 1857.

William Colenso purchased several blocks of land, a large block in Puketapu, Meeanee and 364 near Ōtātara. This block stretched from Guppy Road to the Puketapu hills and was bounded by the Great North Road (now Meeanee/Puketapu Roads) and the Tutaekuri River. Henry Stokes Tiffen bought most of the land north of the road to Puketapu and west of Guppy Road and named it Green Meadows after the native danthonia grass that covered the region. Henry Alley came to the area and leased land from Colenso in 1858, naming the area Taradale.

Naming of Taradale

It was once thought that Alley called the area &quot;Taradale&quot; after the hill of Tara, County Meath, Ireland, where he was supposed to have been born. However, death records show that Henry Alley was not born in County Meath but in Queen&#x27;s County (now county Laois), Ireland. He emigrated with his sister Frances to South Australia and then Victoria, Australia, where he lived in the Victorian township of Taradale until circa 1855, where he purchased a number of blocks of land. Henry Alley built what was reputed to be the first house, somewhere in the vicinity of Alley Place and Lowther Place. Taradale High School retains a link with the early days of Taradale, its emblem incorporating the Tara Brooch.

Town board and borough council

In 1886 a petition was sent to the governor of New Zealand, Sir William Francis Drummond Jervois, asking him to proclaim the district of Taradale as a dependent town district under the provision of the Town Districts Act 1881. The Hawke&#x27;s Bay County Council confirmed the petition and the Town District of Taradale was proclaimed on 2 December 1886. A town board was formed with John Drummond (chairman), Robert Davidson, Richard Martin, Richard Neagle and George Bradley. William Waterhouse was the first Town Clerk. Taradale was administered by the town board from 1886 to 1953, and by a borough council from 1953 to 1968.

Military history

Taradale&#x27;s military history is typical of an early New Zealand town. The Battle of Omarunui, fought nearby on 12 October 1866, saw the settlers and local Māori join to defend against an intrusion by the Hauhau faction during the New Zealand Wars.

District residents volunteered to fight in South Africa against the Boers, and again in World War 1, World War 2 and subsequent engagements that New Zealand has committed to.

===Twentieth century===
1931 earthquake

Before the 1931 Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake, Taradale and Greenmeadows were separated from distant Napier by a harbour lagoon and tidal mudflats, bridged from 1874 by the corduroy Taradale Road. Other access was by the coastal sandpits road to Awatoto, then to Meeanee village and the Great North Road (Meeanee Road). These barriers forced Taradale&#x27;s township and pioneer farming settlers to develop staunch independence, setting up their own facilities, businesses and recreational resources. Many of the elements of this historical heritage remain today; as well as the geographical boundaries, Anderson Park and green patches on the edge of Greenmeadows are visual boundaries that separate Taradale and Greenmeadows from the rest of Napier City. As a consequence of the 1931 earthquake, the raised seabed enabled Napier&#x27;s residential suburbs to spread slowly south towards Taradale and Greenmeadows as swamps were reclaimed. Buildings destroyed by the earthquake were rebuilt in Art Deco style architecture, examples being Taradale Town Hall and Taradale Hotel (now a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant).

Garden Borough

Taradale in the 1960s was one of the fastest-growing boroughs in New Zealand. Retailers considered it a good place to establish shops with rapidly expanding population. People took pride in their property and Taradale became known as the Garden Borough.

Amalgamation

Amalgamation with Napier had been proposed and disputed for many years, and the merger was passed by referendum in 1968. The final meeting of the borough council was held on 26 March 1968 and Taradale became a part of Napier City Council, even though it still retains its strong community spirit. The last mayor of Taradale was Arthur Miller, a popular and respected member of the community. He is remembered for his public service, especially in his push to establish Taradale Intermediate and Taradale High School. His support for education was recognised in 1971, when a new school in Guppy Road was named Arthur Miller School.

=== Recent history ===
Taradale has continued to expand and develop, with a current growth rate of 6.7%, well above the Hawkes Bay regional growth rate of 3.9% and Napier of 3.2%. As new subdivisions meet the increased demand for middle to high-end residential property, there are several new subdivision developments underway in Mission Heights, Citrus Grove and Kent Terrace with over 1400 residential sections in progress. And recent upgrading of Taradale&#x27;s Town Centre is bringing it into the 21st century, as $3.5 million in council funds has been committed to undertake a renovation including garden streetscape and enhanced pedestrian linkages to slow traffic and improve customer access. A revised parking plan forms part of the overall strategy as does further integration with public green space and services such as the library.

== Governance ==
Napier City Council has organised the city into four wards – the Taradale ward comprises Taradale, Greenmeadows, Poraiti, Meeanee and Awatoto, similar to the early Taradale district.

== Geography ==
Taradale is a predominantly middle-upper class residential township, nestled against the Taradale hills 10-minutes drive from the centre of the tourist destination of Napier City. It has over a third of Napier&#x27;s population, and one of the highest socioeconomic demographic profiles in Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

Residential housing spans decades of design styles from villas through art deco. Premium housing is also scattered around the township. Homes in the elevated hill areas to the west of the town centre have views of Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Cape Kidnappers and the Heretaunga plains. Many of Taradale&#x27;s residents commute to the Napier or Hastings CBDs and prefer rural or suburban life as opposed to the city life of central Napier.

Gloucester Street, the main street and shopping area, has core retail that is predominately contained within a traditional busy high street. Taradale&#x27;s village is a vibrant destination with its boutique shopping, café culture and atmosphere. Gloucester Street is within 2 km of the wineries in Church Road and is perfectly situated to benefit from the regular influx of visitors generated by these wineries.

===Greenmeadows===
Greenmeadows. New Zealand is an area some two kilometres north of the Taradale town centre, and an integral part of the Taradale community. Greenmeadows from the beginning has been seen as an &quot;extension of Taradale&quot; rather than a separate community, Greenmeadows formally became a part of Taradale Town District in 1941. This gives the Taradale and Greenmeadows area which is also known merely as &quot;Taradale&quot;, or &quot;Greendale&quot; for local facilities; a population of roughly 17,000. It has a small shopping village with essential services and Greenmeadows New World supermarket.

== Wineries ==

Taradale is a gateway to some of the finest and oldest wineries in New Zealand. The area is rich in wine heritage dating back as far as the 1850s. Two of the most famous vineyards in Hawkes Bay, Mission Estate Winery and Church Road Winery, together attract over 300,000 tourists annually.

Mission Estate Winery, founded in 1851 and occupying its present site in Church Road since 1897, is the oldest New Zealand winery still in operation and is a tourist attraction. French Marist missionaries established the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Marist Mission at Pākōwhai in 1851. The mission was moved to Meeanee in 1858 and a vineyard was established to produce sacramental and table wines, and a church and school were built soon after. In 1880 a two-storied house was built as a seminary. Following the 1887 flood, an 800-acre (325 hectares) property in Church Road was purchased from Henry Tiffen and a new vineyard was established. Some of the original terracing can be seen on the hillside area now used for the Mission Concert held every February. In 1910 the Mount St. Mary Seminary building was moved from Meeanee to its present Mission location on Church Road. It was cut into eleven sections and rolled on logs towed by a traction engine, an operation that took two days. An accommodation block was built and opened in February 1931. The next day the Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake struck, causing serious damage to the entire Mission. Two priests and seven students were killed when the stone chapel was destroyed. The seminary building was refurbished in the early 2000s to accommodate a restaurant and function rooms. The Mission is a popular venue for weddings.

The Church Road Winery, formerly McDonald&#x27;s Wines, was founded in 1897 by Bartholemew Steinmetz, a lay brother from the Marist Mission, and is one of the oldest wineries in Hawke&#x27;s Bay. Some of its most illustrious years were spent under the leadership of pioneer winemaker Tom McDonald, now widely acknowledged as the father of New Zealand&#x27;s premium red wine industry. The winery buildings now include a restaurant, and a wine museum, housed underground, traces the history and techniques of winemaking.

With the rapid growth of the wine industry in Hawke&#x27;s Bay the number of wineries in the Taradale area is increasing. Other wineries near the area include Brookfield&#x27;s Vineyards, Dobel Estate situated on the banks of the Tutaekuri River, Moana Park Winery behind the Taradale hills and Tironui Estate nestled just below Sugarloaf hill.

War Memorial Clock Tower

The Taradale clock tower was built in 1923 as a Taradale and District World War 1 Memorial. The tower is situated where several roads converge and is a prominent landmark. Designed by John Ellis and built by Mr A. B. Davis, the hexagonal tower is 15 metres tall. The tower was unveiled in 1923 by Admiral Viscount Jellicoe, Governor General of New Zealand. Following the 1931 earthquake, the tower developed a lean of but was able to be restored by John Ellis. In 1997 murals depicting the three armed services were painted by Brenda Morrell.

Ormlie Lodge

Ormlie Lodge was built by William Nelson in 1899 as a wedding present to his daughter Gertrude and son-in-law Hector Smith. The 1931 earthquake damaged the house extensively, forcing the Smiths to move out for two years while it was repaired at the cost of £1764 (GB pounds). Gertrude and Hector, who had four daughters, lived their entire married life on the estate. Gertrude died in 1955; Hector remained in the villa another seven years until he sold it in 1962, just before his death at the age of 93.

The new owners turned the home into a private hotel, and the stables were converted into one of Hawkes Bay&#x27;s finest restaurants during the 1960s. For the next twenty years the gracious homestead went through a number of changes and owners. In 1985 fire destroyed the Stables Restaurant. The homestead itself was not touched by the blaze. The Stables Restaurant was never rebuilt. Soon after the fire, new owners bought the lodge, renovated it to its former glory, and engaged the services of the son of the original builder to construct the elegant ballroom, which is now the venue for weddings, conferences and other functions.

== Facilities ==
Taradale Library

When Taradale amalgamated with Napier in 1968, Taradale Library became a branch of Napier Library; the joint library service has been called &quot;Napier Libraries&quot; since a rebranding in 2008. Taradale Library was located in a building on Gloucester Street until 1995, when it moved to a new extension of the former Rugby Club Rooms on White Street. A 2007 study recommended that the library building be extended to a total floor area of 1275 square metres. The current re-built and enlarged Taradale Library building opened on 13 July 2009. The upgrade of $1.7 million provided a light and spacious building that caters for the information, educational and recreational needs of all age groups. The new-look library makes the most of its setting in White Street, with comfortable seating and extensive windows that take advantage of views of Centennial and Taradale parks.

Pettigrew Green Arena

Pettigrew Green Arena is a large facility that can accommodate small or large sports games, concerts and fairs. It has a gym, squash / badminton facilities, yoga and ball training. It also has the Sports Hawkes Bay office, which helps with promoting sport to young people, organising games and competitions and has a service offered to young children to help them lead more healthy lives, as well as some programs for adults.

Tareha Recreational Reserve

Tareha Recreational Reserve is a sport and recreation ground at the southern end of Taradale, near the Tutaekuri River. The land was originally set aside as a Crown reserve in 1917, as part of a soil conservation and river control reserve for the river. The land was separated from the riverbed by the construction of the stopbank in 1970. Its ownership passed from the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Catchment Board to the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council, and during this period it was used as a nursery and for grazing stock. In 1992, Taradale Rugby Club approached the regional council looking to lease the area for playing fields. The negotiations that followed saw the transfer of the land to Napier City to be developed as a recreation reserve for the rapidly expanding urban area of Taradale-Greenmeadows.

The park&#x27;s name commemorates Tareha Te Moananui, a Māori tribal leader and member of Parliament who lived nearby at Waiohiki.

Park Island

Park Island sports and recreation ground is to the north of Taradale, within 5 minutes drive, and adjacent to the suburb of Tamatea. It is heavily used for local, regional and national sporting events, in particular soccer, hockey, and rugby.

== Parks and reserves ==
Sugar Loaf

The 127-metre hill known as Sugar Loaf or Pukekura dominates the skyline of the western hills above Taradale and its distinctive shape can be seen from all over Taradale and parts of Napier. On the summit of the hill was once Pukekura Pā, an outpost pā of Ōtātara Pā and Hikurangi Pā, built and occupied at about the same time. Mr G. Halliwell bought the hill and surrounding land from Henry Tiffen in the 1980s. It has always been a focus for recreation in the area, probably due to the magnificent 360-degree views of Hawke&#x27;s Bay from the summit. In the 1920s it was site of moonlight picnics particularly popular with younger people, and in the 1930s motorbike races were held in Taradale each Easter, with the hill-climb section taking the riders up the steep slopes of Sugar Loaf. The hill did not escape unscathed in the earthquake of 1931. Church Road Winery winemaker Tom McDonald recalled &#x27;seeing the top of the hill rise up in the air and fall down again an estimated seven feet&#x27;. The Halliwell family gave the summit and surrounding area in the 1980s to be retained as a reserve.

Eastern views from the summit cover the Napier–Taradale area and much of the Heretaunga Plains, while western views include the Ruahine and Kaweka Ranges. The track to the summit is steep, especially from the Cumberland Rise entrance. The walk is graded moderate to difficult.

The Taradale Hills are split into 4 parts: The pine tree-covered hill of Mission Heights, the distinctive Sugarloaf, the reserve hill of Dolbel/Puketapu and the steep hill slope of Ōtātara.

Ōtātara Pā Historical Reserve

Located on a commanding hill site south of Taradale, Ōtātara Pā is among New Zealand&#x27;s most important archaeological sites. Providing an insight into the area&#x27;s Māori history, the original Ōtātara and Hikurangi pā sites are encompassed in the 33-hectare historical reserve formed in 1973. Ngāti Pārau of Waiohiki, &quot;kaitiaki&quot; (caretakers) of Ōtātara, have partnered with the Department of Conservation in developing and managing the reserve. Māori occupied the knoll as long ago as the late 15th century, and it was here that Ngāti Kahungunu gained a foothold in Heretaunga and spread to become the dominant iwi in Hawke&#x27;s Bay and the Wairarapa. The remains of house terraces and food pits can be seen, and restoration work has included tree planting, palisades and pouwhenua, the carved posts symbolising the relationship between Māori iwi and hapu and the land.

Following the hilly track, walkers can appreciate the site&#x27;s natural defensive qualities. Standing sentinel over the Heretaunga Plains to the south, both pā were protected from attack by cliffs, steep spurs and a steep drop to the Tutaekuri River.

Dolbel Reserve

Dolbel Reserve is named after brothers Philip and Richard Dolbel, who came from Jersey to New Zealand in 1855 and owned farmland that included the present reserve land. The reserve covers 18 hectares of flat land and hill terrain and a walk to the top gives extensive views over Hawke&#x27;s Bay from Mahia to Cape Kidnappers. There are approximately 10 km of track, on the flat and climbing to the hilltop over open slopes and through gullies of native planting. In 1991 Taradale Rotary Club took on the project of creating a tree park on this council-owned reserve under the guidance of the former Napier Council Parks and Reserves Manager Don Bell. The vision of Rotary was to establish a memorial park of trees for the free use of the community, with people able to arrange to plant a tree to mark a family milestone.

Anderson Park

Anderson Park covers an area of 40 hectares and is situated on what was once a racecourse owned by Henry Tiffen. Napier Park Racing Club set up their headquarters here in 1886 and racing continued until 1961. Several saltwater creeks, used as hazards in the horse races, traversed the area and the line of these can still be traced in the contours of the park. The large pond was used as a &quot;borrowing pond&quot;, the silt being dredged and spread on the straight each season to level and top-dress it. In 1931 the large open space was used as a field hospital for casualties of the earthquake. After the stand was demolished, the rubble was consolidated and grassed over, rather than being removed, now forming a low mound on the southern side of the park. A block of the original stables has been preserved on the western edge of the park, today used as Parks and Reserve Department storage. The land could have become a residential subdivision, but was acquired as a pleasure ground in 1962 by Napier City Council and has been developed into the fine open space it is today. On his death in 1963 Haskell Anderson, after whom the park was named and founder of a large local nursery, left a bequeath to Napier City Council to establish the JN Anderson Family Endowment Fund for tree planting.

Taradale Domain and Centennial Park

Taradale Park was opened in 1916 on land leased and later purchased by Taradale Town Board and over the years has become a valuable community amenity. The water wheel was erected by the Rotary Club in 1968. The wheel was originally built in 1920 and was used to generate electricity in a private home. Taradale Park is the home of the Taradale Sports Association, which includes Taradale Cricket Club, Napier Harriers Club, Greendale Tennis Club and Taradale Association Football Club. Taradale Public Library and associated parking are on a separate title subdivided off Centennial Park. The southern corner of the reserve provides a children&#x27;s play area and a skateboard bowl. Taradale Kindergarten and Taradale Friendship Centre are also on the reserve. A passive recreation area, the western extension – Centennial Park – is treed and includes a rose garden and water features.

<doc id="1203586" wikidata="Q2670328" url="?curid=1203586" title="River Island">
<text>River Island (stylised as RiverIsland and abbreviated as RI) is a London-based, multi-channel fashion brand, founded in 1948 by Bernard Lewis. The retailer has a presence in over 125 of worldwide markets, in stores and online.

Best known for its trend focused womenswear offering, River Island also has menswear, kidswear and pet collections. River Island’s collections are entirely designed in-house at the brand’s West London head office, and it was one of the first vertical fashion retailers in the UK. In the 1960s, it became an influential name in the womenswear fashion scene, under its previous name: Chelsea Girl.

Today, River Island is considered a key player on the UK high street, with 250 stores across the country, including flagship locations in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham, plus a significant online presence. In recent years, the business has expanded internationally, and continued to grow its online offer.

River Island is a private company, and remains fully owned by the Lewis family.

==History==
=== Origins ===
In 1948, Bernard Lewis started selling fruit and vegetables, from a market stall situated in an old bomb site in Notting Hill. Soon after, a second site, named The Wool Shop, opened, selling knitting wool and a small amount of ladies clothing.

Responding to the post-war demand for women’s clothing, Lewis shifted the business focus to clothing and began designing and making clothes in-house. The company sold its first own made design in 1950 – a white, lace trimmed blouse with capped sleeve. Joined by his three brothers, the chain expanded to nine stores under the title Lewis Separates.

=== Chelsea Girl and the 1960s ===
Led by the Lewis family, the business was an influential name in the 1960s fashion scene. By 1965 Lewis Separates had a 70 store empire in the UK and it was decided that the brand needed a new identity. Lewis Separates was re-branded to Chelsea Girl, named after the brand&#x27;s store on King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea - at the time a hub of fashion, music and popular culture.

Chelsea Girl was a key driver of the iconic mini dress trend. According to Bernard Lewis, the business pivoted production to focus on mini dresses in response to strong sales, and between spring and autumn 1965, mini dresses grew from 5-6% of sales to 50%.

The Chelsea Girl name was revived in 2011, with a capsule collection in UK stores focusing on retro styles. In 2022, Chelsea Girl was refreshed again, focusing on a younger consumer and pitched as being for the &quot;new generation of Chelsea girls&quot;.

=== Expansion and introduction of River Island ===
In the 1980s, menswear was introduced to the business for the first time by Bernard’s son, Leonard Lewis, with the Concept Man brand. Concept Man stores were combined with existing Chelsea Girl shops, either in unused first floor spaces or adjacent premises.

In 1988, River Island launched as a menswear store in Exeter, with the name inspired by Leonard Lewis’s time spent on a boat on the Thames. The name and store performed so well that the whole business was rebranded from Chelsea Girl to River Island later in 1988.

=== High street success ===
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the brand continued to grow with a continued focus on trend-led, in-house designs it became a leading high street retailer in the UK. It was also one of the first high street retailers to launch online in the late 1990s.

== Present day ==
River Island is headquartered in West London, with all core teams based in this location, including its in-house design team. Including store staff, River Island employs around 8,400 people in the UK, and in 2019, over 200 staff had worked at River Island for over 25 years.

=== River Studios ===
In 2022, River Island introduced a concept store format called River Studios, it revamped the stores along with adding artificial intelligence to them. By 2024, the concept became their main store format but the River Island name is used instead.

River Studios remains as a fashion range under the name River Island Studios.

=== Leadership ===
River Island is privately owned by the Lewis Family through the Lewis Trust Group. Historically the business has been led by family members, including Bernard&#x27;s sons Clive and Leonard Lewis and nephew Ben Lewis, who led the business for nine years up to 2019. The family remains closely involved in the business, as non-executive directors.

At age 96, Bernard Lewis is also said to still work five days a week at River Island&#x27;s HQ.

Will Kernan took over from Ben Lewis as CEO in 2019. Formerly CEO of cycling retailer Wiggle for two years, and CEO of lifestyle retailer The White Company for five years, Kernan also spent 13 years at New Look, becoming chief operating officer in 2010.

Observers praised the appointment as a &quot;considered&quot;, &quot;intelligent&quot; choice, with commentary noting Kernan&#x27;s appointment was likely to place greater focus on growing digital and international operations to help River Island compete with its high street rivals.

In November 2022, it was announced that Kernan would leave his role as CEO in 2023. 

=== UK operations ===
River Island sells through 300 stores in the UK as well as online. In 2022, the brand launched a new segmentation strategy with the opening of its store in Swansea&#x27;s Morfa retail park. According to River Island this strategy specifically curates stores for their local markets.

In the UK, the brand also sells via select wholesale partners Next, Very and Asos.

=== Digital and multichannel operations ===
In recent years, River Island has invested heavily in its multichannel offer, including in technology, supply chain and logistics. In 2018, then CEO Ben Lewis said: “We want to be a leading retailer but we also want to be a leading tech company.” According to accounts available on Companies House, the business has invested heavily in IT, spending £1.5m in 2018 and 2019, adding infrastructure and staff.

In 2008, River Island was an early adopter of content focused retailing, and launched a website featuring blogs, news, trends and style alongside its ecommerce offer. This is now absorbed into the main ecommerce site, which continues to publish editorial content.

=== International ===
In 1993, the brand expanded outside of Great Britain, with its first shop in Ireland, on Dublin&#x27;s Grafton Street. It later expanded into mainland Europe, opening its Amsterdam shop in 2006.

Today River Island ships to 125 countries globally, and works with international wholesale and franchise partners including Alshaya, Namshi and Zalando. According to Companies House documents, in 2020, around 11% of turnover came from international markets.

In 2021, River Island launched online in the US and Canada, partnering with The Bay in Canada. and Nordstrom in the US. In 2022, select The Bay and Nordstrom stores began stocking River Island.

=== Financials ===
During the Covid-19 pandemic, sales fell dramatically at River Island as lockdown measures forced closures on the entire UK store estate. In its most recent results, covering the 52 weeks to 26 December 2020, turnover fell 31.7% year on year to £600.5m, and the business reported an operating loss of £36.2m, compared with a profit of £21.4m in 2019. CEO Will Kernan has said the business has since &quot;recovered strongly&quot;.

== Products ==
River Island is known for its trend led fashion ranges, all of which are designed in the UK at the retailer’s head office in London.

In addition to its womenswear and menswear lines, River Island launched maternity in 2009, kidswear in 2010 and baby in 2018. In 2018, River Island briefly launched homeware, which was paused due to the pandemic in 2020.

The River Island ecommerce site has also offered third party brands since 2018, including Birkenstock, Superga and Skechers.

In 2022, River Island also launched a third party beauty offering alongside its own small range of fragrances. Brands on offer include Revolution and Vita Liberata.

<doc id="1203589" wikidata="Q1630695" url="?curid=1203589" title="Motor torpedo boat">
<text>A motor torpedo boat is a fast torpedo boat, especially of the mid 20th century. The &quot;motor&quot; in the designation originally referred to their use of petrol engines, typically marinised aircraft engines or their derivatives, which distinguished them from other naval craft of the era, including other torpedo boats, that used steam turbines or reciprocating steam engines. Later, diesel-powered torpedo boats appeared, in turn or retroactively referred to as &quot;motor torpedo boats&quot; for their internal combustion engines, as distinct from steam powered reciprocating or turbine propulsion.

Though other navies built similar petrol-powered craft, the specific designation &quot;motor torpedo boat&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;MTB&quot;, is generally used for craft of the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Canadian Navy boats.

During the Second World War, the US Navy built several classes of marine V-12-powered PT boat, whose hull classification symbol &quot;PT&quot; stood for &quot;patrol, torpedo&quot;, but which were grouped into motor torpedo boat squadrons. German diesel-powered torpedo boats of the Second World War were called &quot;S-boote&quot; (&quot;Schnellboote&quot;, &quot;fast boats&quot;) by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and &quot;E-boats&quot; by the Allies. These large craft (well over 100 ft overall) were not known as motor torpedo boats at the time, but later have been grouped with them by some. Italian MTBs of this period were known as &quot;Motoscafo Armato Silurante&quot; (&quot;MAS boats&quot;, torpedo-armed motorboats). French MTBs were known as &quot;vedettes lance torpilles&quot; (&quot;torpedo-launching fast boats&quot;). Soviet MTBs were known as &quot;торпедные катеры&quot; (&quot;torpyedniye katyery&quot;; &quot;torpedo cutters&quot;, often abbreviated as &quot;TKA&quot;). Romanian MTBs were known as &quot;vedete torpiloare&quot; (&quot;torpedo fast boats&quot;).

The role of the motor torpedo boat has been absorbed in modern navies by the fast attack craft.

== History ==
Torpedo boats were designed for missions that variously involved high speed, operating at night, low speed ambush, and manoeuvrability to allow them to get close enough to launch their torpedoes at enemy vessels. With no significant armour, the boats relied upon surprise and agility at high speed to avoid being hit by gunfire from bigger ships.

The Royal Navy started developing particularly small, agile, and fast petrol-powered torpedo boats in the early 20th century, shortly before the beginning of the First World War. Known as coastal motor boats, these were only around . They were joined by the Italian Navy&#x27;s MAS boats, of displacement. &quot;MAS 15&quot; was the only motor torpedo boat in history to sink a battleship, the Austro-Hungarian vessel &quot;Szent István&quot; in 1918. In the Second World War, Britain fielded a variety of motor launches (MLs), motor torpedo boats (MTBs), motor gunboats (MGBs) and motor anti-submarine boats (MASBs), which were operated by Coastal Forces. A similar size boat with a different role in the Second World War was the BPB high-speed launch used by the RAF for air-sea rescue operations. Diesel-powered MTBs entered the Royal Navy with the and fast patrol boats in 1954. The last MTBs in the Royal Navy were the two s of 1958, which were capable of .

== Specifications ==
Many boats were designated MTBs. A variety of designs were adopted and built. For instance, a type, capable of , was shown in 1930.

===British MTBs===
The following is an incomplete list of British motor torpedo boats:

==== Vosper &quot;private venture boat&quot; ====

Commander Peter Du Cane CBE, the managing director of Vosper Ltd, designed a motor torpedo boat as a private venture in 1936. She was completed and launched in 1937. The vessel was bought by the Admiralty and taken into service with the Royal Navy as MTB 102.

* Length: 
* Beam: 
* Draft: ,
The installed powerplant of three Isotta Fraschini Asso V-18 57-litre petrol engines delivered which gave her a speed of light and when carrying a full load.
* Crew: 2 officers, 10 men.
Armament was two torpedo tubes; depth charges, machine guns and 20mm Oerlikon were trialled on her.

&quot;MTB 102&quot; was the fastest wartime British naval vessel in service. She was at Dunkirk in 1940 for the evacuation of British and French troops, where she served as Rear-Admiral Frederic Wake-Walker&#x27;s flagship after the destroyer HMS &quot;Keith&quot; was sunk. She carried Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower when they reviewed the fleet before the Invasion of Normandy in 1944.

==== British Power Boat 60 ft MTB ====
They were based on the British Power Boat Company Type Two 63 ft HSL (high-speed launch) originally designed for the Royal Air Force for air-sea rescue but reduced to in length. They could carry two torpedoes and achieve a maximum speed of . The Royal Navy ordered their first (of a total of 18) in 1936. These entered service as MTB numbers 1 to 12 and 14 to 19. In the early days of the war, they were painted with different numbers and photos distributed to the press to give the impression the Royal Navy had more than they actually did. One photo was sent to the American monthly &quot;Popular Science&quot; showing the number twenty-three.

==== British Power Boat 72 ft MTB ====
Initially ordered as an MGB in 1941; they were converted to MTBs (412-418, 430-432, and 534-500) from 1942 by addition of two 18-inch tubes and a 6-pdr gun. Although 10 tons heavier after conversion they still made 39 knots.

====Vosper 45 ft MTB====
Built as a private venture, the 45-ft MTBs were scaled down versions of larger Vosper design and intended to be carried by larger vessels. As MTB 104 to 107, these were taken up by Admiralty but found to be poor seakeeping and not used for combat.

MTB 105 was carried aboard the Special Service Vessel HMS &quot;Fidelity&quot; after her conversion to a Commando carrier for service in the Far East with T Company, 40 Commando. &quot;Fidelity&quot; was topedoed and sunk with great loss of life as part of Convoy ON 154. The eight crew of MTB 105, along with two from one of &quot;Fidelity&#x27;s&quot; floatplanes were the only survivors from the sinking.

==== Vosper 70 ft MTB ====
Although various boat lengths were produced by Vosper for the Royal Navy, the &quot;70 ft&quot; boat was produced from 1940. The design was produced with modifications as MTBs 31-40, 57-66, 73-98, 222-245 and 347-362.

Using three Packard V1-12 marine engines, they were capable of around . Early models carried two torpedo tubes, twin machine guns in a &quot;bin&quot; behind the bridge and two machine guns. They could also carry four depth charges.

The Vosper 70 was also used in other navies, such as Romania&#x27;s, which acquired three in 1939, with NMS Viscolul the lead ship of the class.

==== Vosper 73 ft (Type I and Type II) ====

Between 1943 and 1945, the &quot;Vosper 73ft&quot; design appeared; this was a flush-decked type with a slight sheer forward, dispensing entirely with the low forecastle and scalloping of the majority of &#x27;70-footer&#x27; types. The type II differed from the Type I in that it carried a heavier gun armament at the expense of two torpedo tubes. Boats produced to this design carried pennant numbers MTB 380-395 and MTB 523-537. The Type II did not enter service before the end of the war but was in use after the war.
;Type I
* Length: 73 ft (22 m)
* Engine: 3 Packard 4M V12 engines for a total of 4,200 hp
* Speed: 
* Range: at 
* Displacement: 47 t
* Armament:
** Four torpedo tubes
** Oerlikon 20 mm cannon
** Two 0.303 in Vickers K machine guns (optionally two Vickers .50 machine guns)
* Crew: 13

;Type II
* Length 73 ft (22 m)
* Engine 4,200 hp
* Speed 
* Range at 
* Displacement 49 t
* Armament
** Two torpedoes
** 57mm QF 6-pdr Mark IIA gun on powered mounting
** Twin 20mm Oerlikon aft
** Two 0.303 Lewis Guns
* Crew 13

====Thornycroft 75 ft MTB====
The first two (MTB 24, 25) were actually 74 ft prototypes for the design ordered in 1938. Powered by three Isotti-Franschini engines they could reach 37 knots. The later ones, MTBs 49-56, had four Thornycroft RY12 engines but were too slow for operations.

====J S White 75 ft MTB====
A development of the Vosper designs, White had been building under sub-contract. After construction passed to Polish Navy as S5-S10.
Armed with two 18-inch torpedoes, 6-pounder gun forward, twin 20mm Oerlikon aft and two twin .303 machine gun mountings.

==== Fairmile D MTB ====

The Fairmile D was a very large British MTB designed by Bill Holt and conceived by Fairmile Marine for the Royal Navy. Nicknamed &quot;Dog Boats&quot;, they were designed to combat the known advantages of the German E-boats over previous British coastal craft designs. Larger than earlier MTB or motor gun boat (MGB) designs, the Fairmile D was driven by four Packard 12-cylinder 1250 horsepower supercharged petrol engines and could achieve 29 knots (54 km/h; 33 mph) at full load. The boat carried 5,200 gallons of 100 octane fuel for a range, at maximum continuous speed, of 506 nautical miles. Armament varied according to role but could include four 18-inch or two 21-inch torpedoes, 6-pounder and 2-pounder guns, Oerlikons, multiple machine guns and depth charges.

=== Canadian MTBs ===
These boats were designed by Hubert Scott-Paine for the Canadian Power Boat Company, and used by the Royal Canadian Navy 29th MTB Flotilla. Originally designed as motor gun boats (MGBs), carrying a 6-pounder (57mm, 2.24 inch) to engage enemy small craft, they were re-designated MTBs.

Scott-Paine type G 70 foot boat
* Manufacturer: British Power Boats, Hythe
* Displacement: 55 tons
* Overall length: 72 ft 6 inches (21 m)
* Breadth: 20 ft 7 inches (6.3 m)
* Draught: 5 ft 8 inches (1.7 m)
* Maximum speed: (new)
* Armament:
** auto-loading QF 6-pounder (57mm, 2.24 inch) gun

* Powerplant – three Rolls-Royce or Packard 14M supercharged V-12 engines &lt;br&gt;three shafts
* Power – 3,750 hp total
* Range – radius of action at 

== Post-war usage ==

After the end of World War II a number of Royal Navy vessels were stripped and sold for use as houseboats. These included MGBs as well as MTBs. Many of these were moored in maritime locations such as Chichester Canal (&quot;MTB 71&quot;, now restored and on display at the Royal Naval Museum in Gosport), Langstone Harbour, Littlehampton, Hayling Island and Wootton Creek, although most have now disappeared from these locations. More MTB houseboats can be found at Shoreham-by-Sea (West Sussex), Cobden Bridge (Southampton) and Bembridge (Isle of Wight).

<text>Vision Express is a British eyewear company established in 1988, now owned by EssilorLuxottica. It sells spectacles, sunglasses and contact lenses.

==History==
The company opened its first practice in 1988, at the MetroCentre, Gateshead, quickly followed by several other stores. In October 1993 &quot;US Shoe Corp&quot; Cincinnati sold the seven of its LensCrafters&#x27; superstores in the United Kingdom to Vision Express. In 1995, the first store operating on a joint venture basis was opened.

The company had grown to over 220 practices across the United Kingdom by 2007. In May 2008 &quot;Batemans Opticians&quot; was acquired, which comprised a seventy-five practice chain in Southern England. The majority of these practices have since been rebranded as Vision Express.

There are currently 575 clinics throughout the United Kingdom, Jersey and the Republic of Ireland. Of these clinics approx. 195 are fully company-owned, with the remainder being under joint Venture partnerships.

Vision Express is also in Poland, where it has over 110 clinics. It has recently opened a series of clinics in India in partnership with Reliance.

On 1 May 2013, Vision Express announced that it had acquired twelve optical clinics from Crown Eyeglass Ltd. The stores, situated in the North West of England, will become part of the Vision Express portfolio, bringing its total number of outlets in the United Kingdom and Ireland to 331.

Eight of the properties currently trading as Crown Optical Centre and Direkt Optik will transfer optical services to nearby Vision Express premises and Vision Express will seek to retain the valued experience of the Crown Eyeglass Ltd personnel within the Vision Express store network. The remaining four clinics will trade from their existing locations, with their existing teams under Vision Express branding.

On 1 February 2014, the high street retail business of Rayner &amp; Keeler Opticians was bought by Vision Express from &quot;JBR1910 Limited&quot;.

On 1 December 2014 Vision Express announced the acquisition of the business of Liverpool-based &quot;Conlons Opticians&quot; for an undisclosed fee. It was stated that ten of the nineteen clinics purchased would continue to trade from their current locations, with the existing clinic teams as part of the Vision Express portfolio, with the remaining eight clinics transferring services to their nearest Vision Express clinic.

The following day, it was announced that the store in Millom (which was due to be transferred to the nearby location of Barrow-In-Furness), would remain open following a review from local residents, bringing the total number of Vision Express stores to 390 by the end of 2014.

Following a further announcement on 9 December 2014, Vision Express decided to continue to trade from the Conlons store in Annan as part of its portfolio. This increased the total number of clinics to 391 by the end of 2014.

December 2017 saw Vision Express announce the completion of the deal to incorporate 209 Tesco Opticians into their portfolio. This increased the Vision Express store count (in the UK) to 600. By June 2018, all the Tesco Optician clinics had been rebranded to VE@Tesco.

In late March 2020, Vision Express closed non-essential branches indefinitely in a nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Onur Köksal, (CEO) began to initiate the furlough of all non-essential staff. A small number of clinics are said to have remained open to offer essential, emergency clinical care.

From the end of 2020, to present times, the company began to resume routine testing in line with government guidance. Extra efforts followed to ensure that patients with critical care needs were prioritised over non-essential interactions. Patients were called before attending their appointments to confirm that they had not developed any symptoms of COVID-19 and nor had anyone in their household.

==Takeover by Grand Vision==
Grand Vision acquired Vision Express in 1997. The French parent company &quot;Grand Vision&quot; has clinics under various brands across Europe, and the rest of the world. Under franchise agreement there is a strong Vision Express brand present also in Latvian and Lithuanian markets. These clinics were acquired from GrandVision by Latvian entrepreneurs of &quot;LU Optometrijas Centrs SIA&quot;. Currently &quot;Vision Express&quot; brand in Latvia and Lithuania is operated as a part of OC VISION group.

<text>Mambo Graphics (also, 100% Mambo; and marketed as Mambo) is an Australian clothing brand specialises in swimwear, wetsuits, casual wear apparel and surfing accessories. Mambo was launched in 1984 by Australian entrepreneur and founder of Phantom Records, Dare Jennings along with his business partner, Andrew Rich. The headquarters are located in Alexandria, Sydney.

Mambo is available in Australia and New Zealand. In 2011, the retail company expanded its market into the United States and Canada, later establishing stores across the United Kingdom. The first pair of board shorts were created by British fashion designer, Paul Smith. Peter Pilotto and other designers inspired the female wetsuits.

On 6 January 2015, Mambo was acquired by the American brand management and production company, Saban Brands. Four years later, Mambo returned to Australian ownership when it was acquired by Caprice Australia in July 2019.

== History ==
=== Early days ===
In the early 1970s, Dare Jennings owned a large and successful screen printing business, Phantom Textile Printers, producing t-shirt and fabric prints for a variety of commercial clients. He also owned an independent record label, Phantom Records. Mambo began life as an &quot;after-hours&quot; project in the Phantom art room. The graphics were initially created by in-house artists such as musician Jodi Phillis, and by freelance artist, Richard Allan whose first t-shirt graphics, &#x27;Real Wrestlers, Real Wrestling&#x27; and &#x27;Call Of The Wild (Farting Dog)&#x27; were the best-sellers.

&#x27;100% Mambo&#x27; clothing was often available in surf / skate shops in the mid- to late 1980s in the UK. As skateboarders wore much surfer-inspired clothing, Mambo board shorts in loud / Hawaiian patterns were worn by skaters. Other similar surf / skate brands around at the time were Stüssy, Life&#x27;s A Beach and Vision Street Wear. As this was long before skate culture became mainstream (e.g. skate shops often only sold Vans, Vision or Converse shoes), these were usually niche products.

Allan&#x27;s arrival at Mambo was followed by other Australian and overseas artists, including Reg Mombassa, Robert Williams (US) and Ben Frost.

=== Development ===

In 1994, the first Mambo &#x27;Loud Shirt&#x27; was released. The design was influenced by the famous Hawaiian &#x27;Aloha&#x27; shirt. It was called &#x27;Blue Hawaii&#x27; by Martin Plaza (a bandmate of Reg Mombassa). This shirt became one of Mambo&#x27;s best-sellers and started the Mambo &#x27;Loud Shirt&#x27; style.
Mambo opened its first store in 1995. Located in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, it was called the &#x27;Mambo Friendship Store&#x27;. Stores opened in other Australian cities and in the UK, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. By 2001, Mambo had opened 25 independent retail stores.

In 2000 Mambo received an invitation from the Australian Wool Board to design the athlete&#x27;s uniform for the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.
After the Summer Olympic Games, Jennings was approached by Gazal Corporation to buy the brand. Jennings sold the company in March of that year and took over the role of creative director. Jennings left the company in 2002 and later went on to create the surf and moto-inspired brand &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot;.

In 2006, Principle (an Australian research company) named Mambo &quot;Australia&#x27;s sixth-most-authentic brand&quot; alongside Bonds, Speedo, R. M. Williams and Billabong.
In 2008 Mambo was sold to The Nervous Investor Group, an Australian-based consortium headed by Angus Kingsmill and based in the Sydney beachside suburb of Manly.
In 2015 Mambo was sold to US clothing group Saban Brands.
In 2012, Mambo entered into partnerships with key players in the US and Brazil with plans to introduce the brand on a large scale in each country.
In July 2019, Mambo was acquired by 60-year-old family-run brand Caprice Australia, bringing ownership of the Mambo brand to Australia.

<doc id="1203602" wikidata="Q462847" url="?curid=1203602" title="United Airlines Flight 585">
<text>United Airlines Flight 585 was a scheduled passenger flight on March 3, 1991, from Denver to Colorado Springs, Colorado, carrying 20 passengers and 5 crew members on board. The plane experienced a rudder hardover while on final approach to runway 35 at Colorado Springs Municipal Airport, causing the plane to roll over and enter an uncontrolled dive. All 25 people on board the Boeing 737 were killed on impact.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was initially unable to resolve the cause of the crash, but after similar accidents and incidents involving Boeing 737 aircraft, the crash was determined to be caused by a defect in the design of the 737&#x27;s rudder power control unit.

==Background==
=== Aircraft ===
Flight 585 was operated by a Boeing 737-291, registered as N999UA with serial number 22742. It was manufactured in May 1982 for the original incarnation of Frontier Airlines, and was acquired by United Airlines on June 6, 1986, when the former went out of business (a new airline company with the same name formed eight years later). On the date of the accident, the aircraft had logged 26,050 flight hours in 19,734 takeoff and landing cycles.

=== Crew ===
In command was Captain Harold Green, aged 52. Green was hired by United Airlines on May 15, 1969, and had logged 9,902 hours as a United Airlines pilot (including 1,732 hours on the Boeing 737), and was regarded by colleagues as a conservative pilot who always followed standard operating procedures. The first officer was Patricia Eidson, aged 42. Eidson was hired by UAL on November 21, 1988 and had logged 3,903 flight hours (including 1,077 hours on the Boeing 737). She was considered by the captain to be a very competent pilot.

On February 25, 1991, the aircraft was flying at when the rudder abruptly deflected 10 degrees to the right. The crew on board reduced power and the aircraft returned to normal flight. A similar event occurred two days later. Four days later, the aircraft crashed.

==Accident==
Flight 585 was a regularly scheduled flight, originating at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport in Peoria, Illinois to Colorado Springs, Colorado, making intermediate stops at Quad City International Airport in Moline, Illinois, with an intended final stop at Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado, at 09:46 Mountain Standard Time (16:46 UTC). On March 3, 1991, the flight operated from Peoria to Denver without incident.

At 09:23 (16:23 UTC), Flight 585 departed Denver with 20 passengers and 5 crew members on board. At 09:30:37 (16:30:37 UTC), the aircraft received Automatic terminal information service &quot;Lima&quot;, that was about 40 minutes old, stating &quot;Wind three one zero at one three gust three five; low level wind shear advisories are in effect, local aviation wind warning in effect calling for winds out of the northwest gust to and above.&quot; The flight crew added to their target landing airspeed based on this information.

At 09:32:35, First Officer Eidson reported to Colorado Springs Approach Control that their altitude was . Colorado Springs Approach then cleared the flight for a visual approach to runway 35 and instructed the flight to contact Colorado Springs Tower. 

At 09:37:59 (16:37:59 UTC) Colorado Springs Tower cleared Flight 585 to land on runway 35, notifying the flight that wind was 320 degrees at with gusts to . At this moment, the aircraft was at . First Officer Eidson inquired about reports from other aircraft about airspeed changes, and at 09:38:29 (16:38:29 UTC) the tower replied that another 737 had reported a loss at , a gain at , and a gain at , at approximately 09:20 (16:20 UTC), 17 minutes prior. Eidson replied, &quot;Sounds adventurous... United five eighty-five, thank you.&quot;

At 09:40:07 (16:40:07 UTC), Flight 585 was informed of traffic, a Cessna at their eleven o&#x27;clock, northwest bound, landing at runway 30. The crew was unable to locate the traffic, but 37 seconds after it was reported, the tower informed the flight that the traffic was now behind them. This Cessna was located about northeast of the accident when it occurred, and he had also reported slight, occasional, moderate chop at . The Cessna pilot had also noted indicated airspeed fluctuations between and with vertical speed indications of approximately per minute.

At 09:41:23 (16:41:23 UTC), air traffic control directed Flight 585 to hold short of runway 30 after landing to allow for departing traffic. Eidson replied &quot;We&#x27;ll hold short of three-zero, United five eighty five.&quot; This was the last transmission received from the flight.

In the final minute of the flight, normal acceleration varied between 0.6–1.3g, with an airspeed of with 2 to 10 knot excursions.

At 09:42 (16:42 UTC), about 20 seconds prior to the crash, the aircraft entered into a controlled 20-degree bank and turn for alignment with the runway. Four seconds later, First Officer Eidson informed Captain Green that they were at .

Within the next four seconds, at 09:43:33 (16:43:33 UTC), the aircraft suddenly rolled to the right, heading rate increasing to about 5-degrees per second as a result, nearly twice that of a standard rate turn, and pitched nose down. First Officer Eidson stated &quot;Oh God, [flip]!&quot;, and in the same moment Captain Green called for 15-degrees of flaps while increasing thrust, in an attempt to initiate a go-around. The altitude decreased rapidly and acceleration increased to over 4G until, at 09:43:41 (16:43:41 UTC), the aircraft crashed at an 80-degree nose-down angle, yawed 4-degrees to the right, into Widefield Park, less than from the runway threshold, at a speed of . The aircraft was destroyed on impact and by the post-crash fire. According to the accident report, the crash carved a crater and deep. Segments of the 737 were buried deep within this crater, requiring excavation. Everyone on board was killed instantly. The aircraft narrowly missed a row of apartments; a girl standing in the doorway of one of the apartments was knocked backwards by the force of the explosion, hitting her head, but was released from a local hospital with no further issues after treatment.

==Victims==
==Investigation==
===Initial investigation===
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released its concluding report into the crash that occurred on March 3, 1991, involving United Airlines Flight 585. Based on the findings of the research, it was determined that the crash was brought about by a mechanical breakdown in the rudder power control unit of the aircraft. 

The NTSB&#x27;s initial report on the crash was released in December 1992, but it ruled the probable cause as undetermined. The agency reopened the investigation in September 1994 after another crash of USAir Flight 427 that was under similar conditions. The NTSB&#x27;s investigation considered data from the crash of Flight 585, as well as other incidents, including a non-fatal crash in 1996 of Eastwind Airlines flight 517 The NTSB finalized it&#x27;s report on United 585 Report #AAR-01-01 on March 03, 2001. 

Although the flight data recorder (FDR) outer protective case was damaged, the data tape inside was intact and all of the data were recoverable. Five parameters were recorded by the FDR: heading, altitude, airspeed, normal acceleration (G loads), and microphone keying. The FDR did not record rudder, aileron or spoiler deflection data, which could have aided the NTSB in reconstructing the plane&#x27;s final moments. The data available proved insufficient to establish why the plane suddenly went into the fatal dive. The NTSB considered the possibilities of a malfunction of the rudder power control unit servo (which might have caused the rudder to reverse) and the effect that powerful rotor winds from the nearby Rocky Mountains may have had, but there was not enough evidence to prove either hypothesis.

The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was also damaged, though the data tape inside was intact. However, the data tape featured creases that resulted in poor playback quality. The CVR recorded the pilots making a verbal (and possible physical) response to the loss of control.

The first NTSB report (issued on December 8, 1992) did not conclude with the usual &quot;probable cause&quot;. Instead, it stated:

===Intervening events===
Following the failure to identify the cause of Flight 585&#x27;s crash, another Boeing 737 crash occurred under very similar circumstances when USAir Flight 427 crashed while attempting to land in Pennsylvania in 1994.

===Renewed investigation and probable cause===
The NTSB reopened its investigation into Flight 585 in parallel with the USAir Flight 427 investigation, due to the similar nature of the circumstances.

During the NTSB&#x27;s renewed investigation, it was determined that the crash of Flight 585 (and the later Flight 427 crash) was the result of a sudden malfunction of the aircraft&#x27;s rudder power control unit. Another incident (non-fatal) that contributed to the conclusion was that of Eastwind Airlines Flight 517, which had a similar problem upon approach to Richmond on June 9, 1996. On March 27, 2001, the NTSB issued a revised final report for Flight 585, which found that the pilots lost control of the airplane because of a mechanical malfunction. The renewed investigation concluded with a &quot;probable cause&quot; that stated:

==Memorial==
A memorial garden honoring the victims is located at Widefield Park. The garden consists of a gazebo and 25 trees planted in honor of the victims.

==In popular culture==
The Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; dramatized the crash of Flight 585 and the subsequent 737 rudder investigation in a 2007 episode titled &quot;Hidden Danger&quot;.

The crash is dramatized in the episode &quot;Fatal Flaws&quot; of &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;.

<text>Lawrence S. &quot;Larry&quot; Coben (born 1958) is an archaeologist who founded the ESCALA Initiative and the Sustainable Preservation Initiative. He is chairman, president and CEO of NRG Energy, a Fortune 200 integrated electricity and home services company.

==Archaeology/not for profit career==
Coben is a consulting scholar and archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the founder and Executive Director of the Escala Initiative. His most recent work focuses on Inca imperial strategy and the archaeology of performance. He directs a multidisciplinary archaeological project in the Canete Valley of Peru and was director of a project at the monumental site of &quot;Incallajta&quot; in Bolivia. With Takeshi Inomata, he co-authored the book &quot;Archaeology of Performance: Theater, Power and Community&quot;. Richard Schechner described this work as &quot;an important work integrating performance theory, forensics, and classical archaeology to describe and analyze not a &quot;dead past&quot; but pasts that continue to operate as rich repositories of living behaviors.&quot; Coben has published articles on the Inca, archaeological site museums, and the role of performance and spectacle in ancient society. Coben recently delivered a TED talk about alleviating poverty, empowering women and saving cultural heritage entitled &quot;Build Futures, Save Pasts&quot;.

He also runs the aforementioned ESCALA Initiative. The ESCALA Initiative is focused on helping women entrepreneurs in developing countries build a better future for themselves, their families, and their communities. Through its 10-month formalized Business School and Capacity Building Program, ESCALA empowers women entrepreneurs to hurdle economic and social barriers as business owners. The comprehensive and proven curriculum teaches critical entrepreneurial and business skills through workshops and mentoring sessions that prepare students for success. All of the students have either started their own small business or plan to do so while enrolled in the program. They are engaged in a variety of industries such as textiles, food, and tourism. ESCALA presently works in Peru, Mexico, Tanzania, and Guatemala. This paradigm, designed by Coben, has been suggested by the Milken Institute as an optimal solution to preserve and develop Israel&#x27;s cultural heritage
Coben gave a TEDx talk on this subject in 2016. Coben Tedx Talk

Coben is an expert member of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Archaeological Heritage Management (&quot;ICAHM&quot;).

<text>Guillermo &quot;Memo&quot; Gonzalez (born January 4, 1986, in Paramount, California) is an American soccer player, currently without a team.

==Career==

===Professional===
Gonzalez was member of the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida in 2003 (the same class as Eddie Gaven and Freddy Adu), and became one of the youngest players in MLS history when Los Angeles Galaxy drafted him as a Project-40 player with the eighth overall pick of the 2003 MLS SuperDraft at the age of 16.

Guillermo spent most of his first year in the professional ranks playing with the United States U-17 national team, and played at the Under-17 World Championship in Finland.

In his four years in Major League Soccer, Gonzalez did not see much playing time due to his youth team commitments, a cluttered Galaxy midfield, and his own lackluster performances in his limited appearances. During his first two seasons in MLS he played 12 games, but played none at all during his third and fourth seasons. He was waived by the Galaxy during the 2007 pre-season.

===Coaching===
Since his release from the Galaxy, Gonzalez has been unable to catch on with another team, and has begun working as a youth coach. He worked for a period at Immaculate Heart High School in Los Feliz, California. He is also a head varsity coach at Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California.

<doc id="1203619" wikidata="Q3544458" url="?curid=1203619" title="USS Sea Owl">
<text>USS &quot;Sea Owl&quot; (SS/AGSS-405), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the sea owl, a lumpfish of the North Atlantic Ocean.

During World War II, the United States operated two ships named &quot;Sea Owl&quot; in commission at the same time, the Navy&#x27;s SS-405 and the War Shipping Administration′s , a .

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sea Owl&quot; was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 7 February 1944; launched on 7 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas L. Gatch; and commissioned on 17 July 1944.

== World War II ==

After shakedown off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1944. Her first war patrol commenced on 19 November and was conducted in the East China Sea as part of a coordinated attack group with and . She carried trial versions of Mark 18 electric and Mark 27 (&quot;Cutie&quot;) homing torpedoes. After three weeks of searching for worthwhile targets, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; sank her initial victim, a Japanese destroyer escort, with one Mark 27. She followed with a second escort, stopped by a Mark 27 and finished off with one Mark 18, from about 1000 yd (910 m). This was the first combat success for both weapons. The remainder of the patrol was uneventful, and the submarine put into Guam on 15 January 1945.

For her second war patrol, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; joined &quot;Piranha&quot; and in patrolling in Luzon Strait and the South China Sea. She was off Wake Island early on the morning of 18 April when she attacked a Japanese submarine. She is often credited with sinking or in this attack, but &quot;Ro-46&quot; and &quot;Ro-56&quot; were sunk in the vicinity of Okinawa during the first half of April 1945 and neither ever visited the Wake Island area. The submarine &quot;Sea Owl&quot; attacked on 18 April was — and &quot;I-372&quot; survived the attack. &quot;Sea Owl&quot;′s second patrol ended at Midway Atoll on 21 April 1945.

&quot;Sea Owl&quot; got underway for her third and final war patrol on 20 May in concert with &quot;Puffer&quot; and . This patrol was concentrated in the Yellow and East China Seas and was devoted to both lifeguard duties and offensive patrol.

After 19 days, two Japanese destroyers were contacted and six torpedoes were fired from a perfect set-up. The first torpedo hit one of the destroyers in her magazine amidships, blowing her up in the water and allowing the other torpedoes to pass under the target and miss. The other destroyer joined forces with two patrol craft and dropped 84 depth charges during the following 14 hours but inflicted no material damage.The IJN vessel destroyed was the corvette Kaibokan 41 (745 tons) in Tsushima Strait, southeast of Mokpo, Korea in position 34°22&#x27;N, 128°11&#x27;E.

Four days later, &quot;Sea Owl&quot;, in a gun attack, destroyed a large, rice-laden, four-masted schooner from which she captured two prisoners of war. On 2 July, she rescued six downed aviators after a race against darkness. All six were treated for wounds and were included in the crew for the remainder of the patrol.

When the Japanese surrendered on 15 August, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; was in Pearl Harbor preparing for her fourth war patrol.

== 1945 – 1951 ==

Upon returning to the United States in September, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and was based at Balboa in the Canal Zone as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6). From October 1946 through March 1947, she made a cruise along the west coast of South America and joined the other submarines of SubRon 6 in fleet exercises off Culebra Island in the West Indies. She next supported antisubmarine training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Key West, Fla.

&quot;Sea Owl&quot; underwent overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from September 1947 to January 1948 followed by a brief period of refresher training in the Caribbean. She resumed her duties at Balboa on 12 January and, for the next 18 months, operated in the Panama area and Caribbean Sea participating in fleet training exercises.

On 27 June 1949, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; arrived at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for a regularly scheduled overhaul and, upon completion in October, was assigned to SubRon 8 in New London, Conn. For the next two years she operated in the Atlantic, participating in fleet exercises and antisubmarine training.

== 1951 – 1961 ==

&quot;Sea Owl&quot; was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine in the Philadelphia Navy Yard from April to August 1951 and, for the next year, she participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises in the Caribbean area. Early in 1953, the submarine entered Charleston Naval Shipyard in South Carolina for overhaul and, upon completion, sailed to New London and then to the Caribbean as part of operation &quot;Springboard.&quot; After returning to New London in March, she departed for her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, participating in fleet exercises and in Operation &quot;Keystone&quot; and visiting France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and Turkey in a three-month tour.

Returning to New London in August 1954, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; spent the next two years in Atlantic and Caribbean waters training submarine school students and reserve personnel. After engaging in special operations in the late fall of 1956 and early 1957, the submarine resumed normal duties in the New London area until 1 September when she departed to engage in NATO exercises &quot;Fishplay&quot; and &quot;Strikeback&quot; in the northern Atlantic, returning to New London in October.

In April and May 1958, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; participated in NATO Exercise &quot;New Broom&quot; and, upon returning to New London, engaged in local operations for the remainder of the year. After a five-month overhaul early in 1959, she participated in NATO Exercise &quot;Fishplay&quot; and spent the latter months of 1960 in her second deployment to the Mediterranean.

&quot;Sea Owl&quot; commenced 1961 with an extended upkeep period followed by local operations in the New London area. On 6 March, she departed for another Mediterranean tour followed by a scheduled overhaul in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

== 1962 – 1969 ==

After the 1962 Christmas holidays, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; departed for the Caribbean to take part in the second phase of operation &quot;Springboard&quot; including antisubmarine warfare exercises and visits to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Immediately following, she was engaged in a two-week antisubmarine warfare exercise with surface and air units of the Royal Canadian Navy in the vicinity of Bermuda. In April 1963, she participated in Exercise &quot;New Broom XI&quot; with joint forces of the United States and Canada. The remainder of the year consisted of submarine school operations and training exercises in the New London area.

In July 2021, declassified documentation in relation to a FIOA lawsuit surrounding USS Thresher&#x27;s loss, indicate Sea Owl was ordered to and participated in the search for the stricken nuclear submarine. This documentation states that Sea Owl join with nuclear submarine Seawolf, in search procedures on 11 April 1963, and that Seawolf managed to make contact on four separate dives that day, while Sea Owl stood guard to keep interlopers away from the casualty site. This new information surrounding this event is still coming to light, including how much Sea Owl was involved.

On 8 February 1964, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; commenced a five-week availability at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard followed by participation in Exercise &quot;Long Hook&quot; with joint forces of the United States, British, Canadian, and Dutch Navies and in Exercise &quot;Canus Silex&quot; with Canadian and United States Naval forces. In September, the submarine participated in Exercise &quot;Master Stroke&quot; and Exercise &quot;Canus Slamex&quot; with United States, Canadian, and British forces and returned to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 2 November for a five-month overhaul.

On 7 July 1965, &quot;Seal Owl&quot; put to sea for a four-month deployment to the Mediterranean and, after returning to New London, engaged in local exercises for the remainder of the year.

&quot;Sea Owl&quot; spent 1966 providing services for the Submarine School and Operational Test and Evaluation Force in New London with time out for participation in Operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in the Caribbean. During 1967, she participated in various fleet and training exercises; and, on 22 May, deployed to northern European waters for a training and good will tour, returning in July.

During a discharge physical examination, one of the crewman was discovered to have an active case of tuberculosis in an advanced stage. Due to the close environment and isolated atmosphere of the submarine, the crew was transferred to the United States Naval Hospital, St. Albans, N.Y., for three days of intensive tests. Following laboratory analysis, it was found that no other active cases existed, and the crew was returned to the submarine. Because of the unique living conditions of submarine life, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; served as a control group for clinical research for the Tuberculosis Service, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.

Operations for the year 1968 included various fleet exercises, including antisubmarine warfare operations with destroyer units and various NATO and United States ASW naval air squadrons. Training exercises included both officer submarine school and weekend reserve training cruises. &quot;Sea Owl&quot; participated in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s search for the overdue and missing USS Scorpion.

On 30 June 1969, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-405. She departed New London on 7 July for her final deployment to the Mediterranean. Upon return, the submarine was ordered to commence preparations for deactivation. On 15 November, after more than 25 years of dedicated service, &quot;Sea Owl&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. &quot;Sea Owl&quot; was sold for scrapping, 3 June 1971.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Sea Owl&quot; received five battle stars for World War II.

<doc id="1203623" wikidata="Q2516615" url="?curid=1203623" title="Sun Studio">
<text>Sun Studio is a recording studio opened by rock-and-roll pioneer Sam Phillips at 706 Union Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, on January 3, 1950. It was originally called Memphis Recording Service, sharing the same building with the Sun Records label business. The Sun label that was housed within the studio played a large role in Elvis Presley&#x27;s early career.

Reputedly the first rock and roll single, Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats&#x27; &quot;Rocket 88&quot; was recorded there in 1951 with song composer Ike Turner on keyboards, leading the studio to claim status as the birthplace of rock &amp; roll. Blues and R&amp;B artists like Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Junior Parker, Little Milton, B.B. King, James Cotton, Rufus Thomas, and Rosco Gordon recorded there in the early 1950s.

Rock and roll, country, and rockabilly artists, including Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Charlie Feathers, Ray Harris, Warren Smith, Charlie Rich, and Jerry Lee Lewis, recorded there throughout the mid-to-late 1950s until the studio outgrew its Union Avenue location. Sam Phillips opened the larger Sam C. Phillips Recording Studio, better known as Phillips Recording, in 1959 to replace the older facility. Since Phillips had invested in the Holiday Inn Hotel chain earlier, he also recorded artists starting in 1963 on the label Holiday Inn Records for Kemmons Wilson. In 1957, Bill Justis recorded his Grammy Hall of Fame song &quot;Raunchy&quot; for Sam Phillips and worked as a musical director at Sun Records.

In 1969, Sam Phillips sold the label to Shelby Singleton, and there was no recording-related or label-related activity again in the building until the September 1985 &quot;Class of &#x27;55&quot; recording sessions with Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, produced by Chips Moman.

In 1987, the original building housing the Sun Records label and Memphis Recording Service was reopened by Gary Hardy as &quot;Sun Studio,&quot; a recording label and tourist attraction that has attracted many notable artists, such as U2, Def Leppard, Bonnie Raitt, and Ringo Starr.

==Beginnings and Phillips Records==

In January 1950, WREC radio engineer Sam Phillips opened the Memphis Recording Service at 706 Union Avenue with his assistant and long-time friend, Marion Keisker. Phillips had dreamed of opening his own recording studio since he was a young man, and now that it was a reality he was overjoyed. However, getting the company off the ground was not an easy task. To create revenue at the beginning, Phillips would record conventions, weddings, choirs, and even funerals. He also held an open door policy, allowing anybody to walk in and, for a small fee, record their own record. Phillips&#x27; slogan for his studio was &quot;We Record Anything, Anywhere, Anytime.&quot; In June 1950, Phillips and a friend, local DJ Dewey Phillips who was no relation, set up their own record label called Phillips Records. The purpose of the label was to record &quot;negro artists of the South&quot; who wanted to make a recording but had no place to do so. The label failed to make an impact and folded after just one release; &quot;Boogie in the Park&quot; by Joe Hill Louis, which sold less than 400 copies.

=== &quot;Rocket 88&quot; ===
After the failure of Phillips Records, Phillips began working closely with other record labels such as Chess Records and Modern Records, providing demo recordings for them and recording master tapes for their artists. It was during this time that Phillips recorded what many consider to be the first rock and roll song, &quot;Rocket 88&quot; by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, who were actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. Some biographers have suggested that it was Phillips&#x27; inventive creativeness that led to the song&#x27;s unique sound, but others put it down to the fact that the amplifier used on the record was broken, leading to a &quot;fuzzy&quot; sound. The Sun Studio tour lends credence to the latter, with the tour guide saying the amplifier was stuffed with wads of newspaper.

==Sun Records==

In early 1952, Phillips once again launched his own record label, this time calling it Sun Records. During his first year he recorded several artists who would go on to have successful careers. Among them were B.B. King, Joe Hill Louis, Rufus Thomas, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Despite the number of singers who recorded there, Phillips found it increasingly difficult to keep profits up. He reportedly drove over 60,000 miles in one year to promote his artists with radio stations and distributors. To keep costs down, he would pay his artists three percent royalties instead of the usual five percent that was more common at the time. Phillips turned to alcohol when it looked like his label would once again fail, and he was put into a mental hospital at one point, reportedly getting electric shock treatment.

Rufus Thomas&#x27; &quot;Bearcat&quot;, a recording that was similar to &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, was the first real hit for Sun in 1953. Although the song was the label&#x27;s first hit, a copyright-infringement suit ensued and nearly bankrupted Phillips&#x27; record label. Despite this, Phillips was able to keep his business afloat by recording several other acts, including the Prisonaires, a black quartet who were given permission to leave prison in June 1953 to record their single, &quot;Just Walkin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, later a hit for Johnnie Ray in 1956. The song was a big enough hit that the local newspaper took an interest in the story of its recording. A few biographers have said that this article, printed in the &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot; on July 15, influenced Elvis Presley to seek out Sun to record a demo record.

==Elvis Presley==
In August 1953, fresh out of his high school graduation the previous June, the 18½ year old Presley walked into the offices of Sun. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: &quot;My Happiness&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s When Your Heartaches Begin&quot;. He would later claim he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or was merely interested in what he &quot;sounded like&quot;, though there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, &quot;I sing all kinds.&quot; When she pressed him on whom he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, &quot;I don&#x27;t sound like nobody.&quot; After he recorded, Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man&#x27;s name, which she did along with her own commentary: &quot;Good ballad singer. Hold.&quot; Presley cut a second acetate in January 1954—&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Stand In Your Way&quot; and &quot;It Wouldn&#x27;t Be the Same Without You&quot;—but again nothing came of it.

Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused to a broader audience. As Keisker reported, &quot;Over and over I remember Sam saying, &#x27;If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.&#x27;&quot; In June, he acquired a demo recording of a ballad, &quot;Without You&quot;, that he thought might suit the teenaged singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield &quot;Scotty&quot; Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.

The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;. Moore recalled, &quot;All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, &#x27;What are you doing?&#x27; And we said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t know.&#x27; &#x27;Well, back up,&#x27; he said, &#x27;try to find a place to start, and do it again.&#x27;&quot; Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; on his &quot;Red, Hot, and Blue&quot; show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed &quot;slapback&quot;. A single was pressed with &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; on the A side and &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; on the reverse.

===Selling Presley===
Within months Phillips saw his label expand significantly owing to the number of Presley records sold. Radio stations and record stores all over the South were eager to play them, and as Presley&#x27;s profile grew over the next year, Phillips realized Sun was not large enough to break him throughout the United States. In February 1955, Phillips met with Colonel Tom Parker, a man known for his hustling skills as well as his managerial ones. Parker persuaded Phillips that Presley needed a national record label to help him further his career, and after several more months Phillips agreed to sell Presley&#x27;s contract. He told Parker that he would require a $5,000 down-payment by November 15, as an advance on a $35,000 buy out fee. At the time, $35,000 was an unheard of amount of money for a recording artist&#x27;s contract, especially one who had yet to prove himself on the national stage.

Although Presley didn&#x27;t want to leave Sun, according to Sun engineer Jack Clement, Phillips sold his contract because he needed the money to settle debts and pay off costs still associated with Rufus Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Bearcat&quot; copyright-infringement suit. Phillips, however, insisted that he only offered Presley&#x27;s contract for $35,000 because he believed it would put off any other record label from purchasing it. Regardless, Presley signed a record contract with RCA Victor in November 1955, and left Sun. Phillips used some of the money to further advance the careers of his other artists, by now featuring Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison.

===Million Dollar Quartet===
On December 4, 1956 an impromptu jam session among Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash took place at Sun Studio. 
The jam session seems to have happened by pure chance. Perkins, who by this time had already met success with &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, had come into the studio that day, accompanied by his brothers Clayton and Jay and by drummer W.S. Holland, their aim being to cut some new material, including a revamped version of an old blues song, &quot;Matchbox&quot;. Phillips, who wished to try to fatten this sparse rockabilly instrumentation, had brought in his latest acquisition, singer and piano man extraordinaire Jerry Lee Lewis, still unknown outside Memphis, to play piano on the Perkins session.

Sometime in the early afternoon, Presley dropped in to pay a casual visit accompanied by a girlfriend, Marilyn Evans. He was, at the time, the biggest name in show business, having hit the top of the singles charts five times, and topping the album charts twice in the preceding 12-month period. Less than four months earlier, he had appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, pulling an unheard-of 83% of the television audience, which was estimated at 55 million, the largest in history up to that time.

After chatting with Philips in the control room, Presley listened to the playback of Perkins’ session, which he pronounced to be good. Then he went out into the studio and some time later the jam session began. At some point during the session, Sun artist Johnny Cash, who had recently enjoyed a few hits on the country charts, popped in. (Cash wrote in his autobiography &quot;Cash&quot; that he had been first to arrive at the Sun Studio that day, wanting to listen in on the Perkins recording session.) &quot;Cowboy&quot; Jack Clement was engineering that day and remembers saying to himself &quot;I think I&#x27;d be remiss not to record this&quot; and so he did. After jamming through a number of songs using someone else&#x27;s guitar for an hour, Elvis and girlfriend Evans slipped out as Jerry Lee pounded away on the piano. Cash claims in &quot;Cash&quot; that &quot;no one wanted to follow Jerry Lee, not even Elvis.&quot;

During the session Phillips spotted an opportunity for some publicity and called a local newspaper, the &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot;. Bob Johnson, the newspaper&#x27;s entertainment editor, came over to the studio accompanied by a UPI representative named Leo Soroca and a photographer.

The following day, an article, written by Johnson about the session, was published in the &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot; under the title &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot;. The article contained the now-famous photograph of Presley seated at the piano surrounded by Lewis, Perkins and Cash (the uncropped version of the photo also includes Evans, shown seated atop the piano). This photo proves Cash was there, but the audio doesn&#x27;t provide substantial proof he joined in on the session.

==Decline==
For several years after Presley left Sun, Phillips had success with other acts. Sun Studio became known as a place that nurtured talent and then encouraged it to expand with bigger labels. In 1959, Phillips moved Sun Studio to larger premises at 639 Madison Avenue. By the mid 1960s, Phillips had lost interest in recording and had instead branched out into radio. He opened several radio stations, beginning in the late 1950s, and Sun lost its reputation as an innovative recording studio. In 1968, Sun released its last record. In 1969, Mercury Records label producer Shelby Singleton – noted for producing the Ray Stevens&#x27; hit &quot;Ahab the Arab&quot; in 1962, and later Jeannie C. Riley&#x27;s 1968 hit single &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; on his Nashville-based Plantation Records label – purchased the Sun label from Phillips. Singleton merged his operations into Sun International Corporation, which re-released and re-packaged compilations of Sun&#x27;s early artists in the early 1970s. Singleton moved the firm to Nashville, and sold the building to a plumbing company, who eventually sold it to an auto parts store, which used the original recording studio for inventory storage.

Since, Sun Records Studio has been used as a setting for the film biopics &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, &quot;Mystery Train&quot; and &quot;Elvis&quot;.

==Re-opening==
In 1987, ten years after Presley died, Sun Studio at 706 Union Avenue was converted back into a recording studio, and soon became a tourist attraction for Presley fans and music lovers in general. The studio was also used by several well known acts to record, including U2, Def Leppard, John Mellencamp, the Bogus Bros. and Chris Isaak &amp; Silvertone to name a few. In 2003 it was officially recognized as a National Historic Landmark tourist attraction.

In May 2009, Canadian blues artist JW-Jones recorded with blues legend Hubert Sumlin, Larry Taylor and Richard Innes at the studio. In July 2009, John Mellencamp recorded nine songs for his album &quot;No Better Than This&quot; at the studio. In 2011, Chris Isaak released &quot;Beyond the Sun,&quot; a collection of songs recorded at Sun Studio, most of which are cover versions of songs originally released on Sun Records.

Sun Studio regularly releases studio session podcasts on YouTube and on Public Television. Sun Studio announced that PBS affiliate stations would be showing a 30-minute series of &quot;Sun Studio Sessions&quot; starting in January 2010.

<doc id="1203627" wikidata="Q2593247" url="?curid=1203627" title="Woodville, New Zealand">
<text>Woodville, previously known as The Junction, is a small town in the southern North Island of New Zealand, 75 km north of Masterton and 25 km east of Palmerston North. The 2013 census showed that 1401 people reside in Woodville.

The town is in the Tararua District and the Manawatū-Whanganui region, although it has strong ties with the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region, of which it was once a part, but is often considered to be the northern boundary of Wairarapa. It is within the catchment area of the Manawatū River.

==Geography==

Woodville covers a land area of 4.04 km2.

Only a few kilometres west of Woodville, the Manawatu River runs from east to west and cuts a deep gorge through the mountains, effectively slicing a mountain range in two. It is unusual geology as the river flows east towards the Pacific coast of the lower North Island, then cuts back west through the gorge and flows out into the Tasman Sea near Foxton.

Known by Māori as Te Āpiti, the gorge itself features in Māori mythology as the consequence of a show of strength by Okatia as he made his way to the sea. Hacked into the steep sides of the gorge on each side of the river are a road, now permanently closed, and a little-used railway. Since the indefinite closure of the Manawatū Gorge road, the Saddle Road and the Pahiatua Track now provide the easiest access between the east and west coasts of the southern North Island.

Once a vital route between Manawatū, Hawkes Bay and Wairarapa, geologic instability means the Manawatū Gorge road will never be re-opened. A new 4-lane road project was approved by the NZ Government in September 2019. It will be built between the existing Saddle Road and the Manawatū Gorge, connecting to SH2 west of Woodville.

==History==

Woodville is at the northern end of the Tararua Range and the southern end of the Ruahines. In Māori history, it appears to have been a traveller&#x27;s rest spot and a place for hunters to rest after they had walked from one side of the Manawatū Gorge to the other. The local iwi were Rangitāne, descended from Whatonga of the Kurahaupo canoe. They maintained strong and positive relations with other tribes for the most part.

One local landmark is Wharite, one of the main peaks in the Ruahine Ranges, a mountain range that runs northeast for 110 km from the Manawatū Gorge to the Kawekas, inland from Napier. The name for the 920m/3017 foot high mountain appears to be a corruption of the original name Wharetiti (Whare – house, titi – muttonbird (the Sooty Shearwater)). According to an interview on Radio Woodville in 2009, the peak gained its name when migrating muttonbird nested on top of the ridges of the Ruahine mountain range.

The birds arrived at Wharetiti from Bare Island, Waimarama and continued northwards to Tongariro. Local Māori would construct temporary housing when the titi began to arrive and would harvest the birds from their burrows, preserving them inside pouches made from bull kelp which they carried up from the coast. It is some years since muttonbirds were last seen in this part of the Ruahines.

==Government==
Woodville was part of Hawke&#x27;s Bay Province. Following the abolition of the provincial councils in 1876, it became part of Waipawa Country, and on 24 December 1884, the Woodville Town Board was formed within the county. Woodville was constituted a borough in June 1887. In 1987, Woodville Borough merged with the neighbouring Woodville County to form Woodville District. As part of the 1989 local government reforms, Woodville District amalgamated with Dannevirke Borough, Eketahuna County, Pahiatua Borough, and Pahiatua County to form Tararua District.

===List of mayors===
During the 102 years of Woodville Borough and Woodville District Councils, Woodville had 19 mayors. The following is a complete list:

==Demography==
Woodville covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Woodville had a population of 1,548 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 147 people (10.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 147 people (10.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 648 households, comprising 777 males and 774 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.0 males per female. The median age was 44.9 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 315 people (20.3%) aged under 15 years, 219 (14.1%) aged 15 to 29, 702 (45.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 315 (20.3%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 81.8% European/Pākehā, 26.0% Māori, 3.1% Pasifika, 3.3% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 11.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 52.3% had no religion, 31.4% were Christian, 2.5% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.4% were Buddhist and 1.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 123 (10.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 399 (32.4%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $22,700, compared with $31,800 nationally. 102 people (8.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 468 (38.0%) people were employed full-time, 180 (14.6%) were part-time, and 54 (4.4%) were unemployed.

==Economy==

Woodville&#x27;s place in European migration history was established when it became the third of three sizeable timber milling towns in the &#x27;Seventy Mile Bush&#x27; which extended along the eastern side of the Tararua Range and Ruahine Range. The others were Dannevirke and Pahiatua.

As farmland was settled and cleared, a number of small dairy factories were established to process the supply of milk for consumption as milk, cheese or other dairy products. As recently as the mid-1980s the dairy factory at the western end of Woodville, on State Highway 2 heading towards the Manawatū Gorge, operated a cheese processing line and a &#x27;factory shop&#x27; selling dairy produce direct to the public. A thriving sheep and beef economy at one stage supported a number of local trucking firms and carriers, among them Gunn Transport and Hawkes Bay Farmers Transport, both of which were based at a site at the corner of State Highway 2/Vogel Street and Tay Street, which is the Wairarapa bypass. The site is now the offices for Horizons Regional Council. These haulage businesses were only economic in the pre-deregulated transport industry that existed prior to the Rogernomics reforms of the Lange Labour Government elected in 1984. With the lifting of distance restrictions (vehicles over a certain weight were at one stage restricted to travelling only 150 km from their geographic base) Woodville&#x27;s role as a transport hub quickly fell away.

In addition, the local community sustained a supermarket (closed for a period in the 1980s, since re-opened as a Four Square) a Feltex fabrication factory, built in the mid-1970s and closed by the mid-1980s - at least four or five service station or garage outlets of which only one remains on the west side of the township, and a significant railway presence.

The advent of the Oringi Meatworks in 1980-81 was a boost to Woodville&#x27;s economy as a consequence of significant wage inflows from Woodville people working at Oringi. Oringi&#x27;s plant closed in 2008. Very little light industry has survived into the 21st century, and the local agricultural community is supported from Palmerston North, Pahiatua or Dannevirke. Milk from farms in the Woodville district was, until 2015, transported by rail from the Oringi Milk Transfer Station to Hawera for processing. It is now processed locally at the Fonterra plant in Pahiatua.

There has been a boost to the local economy with the construction and maintenance of the Te Āpiti Wind Farm on the ridges above the town. The foothills of the Ruahine and Tararua mountain ranges are to the west of Woodville. The lower ridges are now dotted with wind turbines making up New Zealand&#x27;s largest wind farm, which was established in the early 2000s. The prevailing westerly winds in the Manawatu-Southern Hawkes Bay region provide a consistent Median Wind Velocity which is the key relevant measure for wind generation as a renewable energy source. Manawatu&#x27;s flat pastoral lands and in particular the funnel effect created by the Manawatū Gorge, mean the area is well known for being subject to regular high winds.

Following detailed assessment and testing in the early 1990s, the decision was made by newly privatised electricity generation companies to site two large farms on the ridge-lines. The Te Āpiti Wind Farm is made up of 55 turbines, generating about 90 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 30,000 homes. Dannevirke Power Board first connected Woodville to Mangahao hydro-electric power station in 1925.

==Transportation==

As of 2018, among those who commute to work, 78.3% drove a car, 3.7% rode in a car, 0.9% use a bike, and 0.9% walked or run. No one commuted by public transport.

State Highway 3 through the gorge, on the southern Tararua side of the river, is closed. It will be replaced with a new state highway in the 2020s.

The Palmerston North - Gisborne railway line runs along the northern bank of the river. At Woodville Railway Station, the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line meets the Wairarapa Line and a balloon loop - a rare example of railway engineering where trains reverse direction on a loop track built specifically for the purpose - permits through running via the Wairarapa to Wellington.

Due to low freight levels, the northern portion of the Wairarapa line was reviewed in 2010 as part of KiwiRail&#x27;s turnaround plan. It remains a low traffic network. In some weeks there is only a single train on the line, running from Wellington to Napier. The use of the railway by Fonterra for bulk milk haulage from Oringi meant the Hawke&#x27;s Bay line was sufficiently busy. Fonterra&#x27;s Oringi milk transfer station was decommissioned in 2015-16.

==Culture==

Te Ahu a Turanga i Mua marae is located on Tay Street. It is a tribal meeting ground of Rangitāne and its Ngāti Te Koro and Ngāti Te Rangiwhakaewa sub-tribe. It includes Te Ahu a Turanga i Mua meeting house.

One of New Zealand&#x27;s first international hit songs, &quot;Blue Smoke&quot; was written by Ruru Karaitiana, who was born on a farm between Woodville and Dannevirke. Karaitiana served with the Māori Battalion in World War II and wrote and recorded the song on his return to New Zealand. It has been covered by other artists including Dean Martin.

Woodville was the original home of the Mountain Rock Music Festival, a celebration of New Zealand music growing to be the largest celebration of New Zealand music during the 1990s.

Artist Gottfried Lindauer is buried in the local Old Gorge Cemetery.

==Sport==

Woodville has produced a number of well-regarded sporting competitors, particularly in the 1980s. Robert Collings Tennent formed the first rugby club in New Zealand when he lived in Nelson. Born in Rio de Janeiro, he moved with his family to New Zealand in the 1860s and was only 19 at the time he set up Nelson Rugby Club. He later moved north and was instrumental in forming more rugby clubs in Taranaki (Patea) and Manawatu. He also played first-class cricket in Nelson in the 1870s. Tennent later moved to Woodville and is buried in the Old Gorge Cemetery.

Woodville continues to host a successful horse-racing, rearing and training industry, based at the Woodville &amp; Pahiatua Jockey Club&#x27;s track on the north-east of the town.

Woodville has hosted the New Zealand MotoCross Grand Prix motorcycling races since 1961. Now widely regarded as New Zealand&#x27;s premier motocross event, the Woodville Grand Prix is held in the height of summer in January each year. Held on the Cleghorn farm near the eastern entrance to the Manawatū Gorge, the honours board to 2011 features several well-known motorsport names, not least of whom is Ken Cleghorn (of the farm owning family) himself. Another notable early racer was Tim Gibbes of Palmerston North, who helped teach Hollywood actor Steve McQueen several stunts for The Great Escape.

<doc id="1203631" wikidata="Q1138432" url="?curid=1203631" title="Elton John (album)">
<text>Elton John is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Elton John. It was released on 10 April 1970 through DJM Records. Including John&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;Your Song&quot;, the album helped establish his career during the rise of the singer-songwriter era of popular music.

In the US, &quot;Elton John&quot; was certified gold in February 1971 by the RIAA. In the same year, it was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2003, the album was ranked number 468 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. On 27 November 2012, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame as an album cited as exhibiting &quot;qualitative or historical significance&quot;.

==Production==
This was the first of a string of John albums produced by Gus Dudgeon. As Dudgeon recalled in a &quot;Mix&quot; magazine interview, the album was not actually intended to launch John as an artist, but rather as a collection of polished demos for other artists to consider recording his and co-writer Bernie Taupin&#x27;s songs. Two songs from the album did find their way into the repertoire of other artists in 1970: &quot;Your Song&quot; was recorded by Three Dog Night as an album track on their LP &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;, while Aretha Franklin released a cover of &quot;Border Song&quot; as a single that reached number 37 in the US pop charts and number 5 on the R&amp;B chart, later included on her 1972 album &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot;.

The song &quot;No Shoe Strings on Louise&quot; was intended (as homage or parody) to sound like a Rolling Stones song.

==Reception==
John Mendelsohn in a contemporary (1970) review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that the album was over-produced and over-orchestrated, comparing it unfavourably with the less mannered and orchestrated &quot;Empty Sky&quot;; though he felt that John had &quot;so immense a talent&quot; that &quot;he&#x27;ll delight you senseless despite it all&quot;. Robert Christgau in his weekly &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; also felt the album was overdone (&quot;overweening&quot;, &quot;histrionic overload&quot;, &quot;semi-classical ponderousness&quot;), but that it had &quot;a surprising complement of memorable tracks&quot;, including &quot;Your Song&quot; which, despite its &quot;affected offhandedness&quot;, he considered &quot;an instant standard&quot;.

<text>Nyogen Senzaki (千崎 如幻, 1876–1958) was a Rinzai Zen monk who was one of the 20th century&#x27;s leading proponents of Zen Buddhism in the United States.

==Early life==

Details of Senzaki&#x27;s early life are unclear. Town records in Fukaura, Aomori state Senzaki was born on October 5, 1876, as the Senzaki family&#x27;s first son. He was named Aizo Senzaki. As a youth, Senzaki&#x27;s grandmother told him he had been abandoned as an infant and was discovered by a fisherman from Sakhalin island, Siberia who reportedly brought him back to Aomori Prefecture.

His father is unknown, but he was either Russian or Chinese. Aizo&#x27;s grandmother was perhaps misinformed in her version of events, because some accounts state young Senzaki was adopted by a travelling Kegon Buddhist priest and brought back to Japan.

==Early training==

When Senzaki was five years old his mother died. He was sent to a Pure Land temple run by his grandfather, with whom he began the study of many Chinese classics. The elderly priest had a profound influence on him, which was, as Nyogen Senzaki later wrote, &quot;to live up to the Buddhist ideals outside of name and fame and to avoid as far as possible the world of loss and gain&quot;. When Senzaki was 16 his grandfather died, stating to Aizo just before dying:

When his grandfather died Senzaki left his grandfather&#x27;s temple and enrolled in a school to prepare for medical school. According to his own account, he read the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin while in school and tried to imitate Franklin&#x27;s approach toward spirituality. He felt himself drawn a bit to Christianity, during this period, but ended up meeting a haiku poet who taught him about Matsuo Bashō. By the age of 18 he had read the entirety of the Tripitaka. During this period he read about how Tokusan had burned a volume of Diamond Sutra commentaries he himself was currently studying. This was Aizo&#x27;s turning point, and he decided to become a Zen Buddhist monk.

On April 8, 1895 (on &quot;Vesak&quot;), when Aizo was 19, he was ordained as a monk and was given the Dharma name Nyogen at a &quot;Soto Zen&quot; temple. The word Nyogen means &quot;Like a dream, like a fantasy&quot; in Japanese and came from the concluding verse of Diamond Sutra. Nyogen says he would have preferred to be ordained at a Rinzai temple, but there was none in his area. The next year Nyogen went to Kamakura to Engaku-ji where he studied Zen under Rinzai master Soyen Shaku.
Soyen was a strict teacher who was very harsh and physical in his training methods. During this time Nyogen contracted tuberculosis and lived in virtual confinement in a small hut on the grounds of the monastery. The next year, on the verge of death, somehow his condition managed to improve and he was able to go back to the monastery.

Here Nyogen came to meet another 20th-century pioneer of Zen, D.T. Suzuki. Suzuki was a lay student of Soyen Shaku. Nyogen was becoming disconcerted with the institutional practices of the monastery at the time, and turned to books as a means of release. Here he came across the works of Friedrich Fröbel, the founder of kindergarten. In 1901, Nyogen asked Soyen if he could leave the monastery to open a kindergarten. He called it Mentorgarten, a place free of religiosity and ritual where children could be children.

==America==

By the start of the 20th century Japan had become dangerously nationalistic. In 1905 Soyen Shaku was asked by friends in the San Francisco, CA area to come and give talks and lectures on Buddhism. Soyen needed an attendant for his time there, and asked Nyogen to come with him. Nyogen jumped at the opportunity, for he was dissatisfied with the nationalism all around him and the institutional way in which Zen was then being practiced. So they left that same year and landed in Seattle, WA where they stayed for a few days, and then headed for San Francisco. When it was time for the two to return to Japan, Soyen sensed his student&#x27;s turmoil at the prospect of returning.

In Golden Gate Park, Soyen Shaku set down his friend Nyogen&#x27;s suitcase and said the following to him:

With those words Shaku spun about and left Nyogen there, and the two would never meet face to face again. Nyogen stayed in the USA for the rest of his life, with the exception of a trip in 1955 back to Japan to visit his friend Soen Nakagawa. In the San Francisco area Nyogen performed jobs as a hotel clerk and elevator assistant (among other jobs) to get by. He certainly was struggling with his finances. During his spare time Nyogen would visit the San Francisco Public Library often and read books on Immanuel Kant, Ralph Waldo Emerson and William James. He was studying English and developed a good grasp of the language.

==Floating Zendo==

In 1919 Nyogen received word that Shaku had died back in Japan. Around this time, he compiled the famous book &quot;101 Zen Stories&quot;. In 1922 Nyogen scraped together enough money to rent out a hall and lecture on Zen. He continued this, moving from place to place throughout the city teaching about Zen meditation. By 1927 he had developed a small following with his &quot;floating zendo.&quot; His only material whilst going from hall to hall was a picture of Manjusri Bodhisattva. Eventually, along with the help of some students, he managed to rent an apartment in San Francisco where he would hold practice. During this period he even had a guest speaker from Japan come to lecture, Gyudo Furukawa.

Nyogen moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s, where he again rented out an apartment and continued the so-called &quot;floating zendo&quot; model. Soon Senzaki became familiar with the community of Japanese immigrants there. In 1932 he befriended a Japanese woman named Kin Tanahashi, who had a developmentally disabled boy. Nyogen cared for the boy in exchange for room and board. It was Mrs. Tanahashi who introduced Nyogen to the haiku poetry of Soen Nakagawa, an unconventional young monk practicing in Japan, who would go on to become one of the most prominent Rinzai Zen teachers to come West. Senzaki was extremely impressed with these poems, so he contacted Soen and they began corresponding with one another.

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the signing of Executive Order 9066, Senzaki was among the tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans to be relocated to internment camps. He spent the duration of World War II in Heart Mountain, Wyoming.

At the conclusion of the war, Senzaki moved what he called his &quot;Floating Zendo&quot; to Los Angeles. While making his living in a number of ways he devoted his passion for the rest of his life to teaching Zen. Among his students at this time were Robert Aitken, who would become one of the most significant of modern Western Zen teachers, and Samuel L. Lewis who would later be known as a prominent Sufi teacher in the line of Inayat Khan and Zen teacher in the lineage of Korean Zen Master Dr. Kyung-Bo Seo. Also, Senzaki maintained his long-term correspondence with Soen Nakagawa.

Senzaki died on May 7, 1958, at 81 years old. There are several versions of his &quot;last words,&quot; one of the most compelling of which is &quot;Remember the Dharma! Remember the Dharma! Remember the Dharma!&quot;

<doc id="1203653" wikidata="Q6839147" url="?curid=1203653" title="Micro Adventure">
<text>Micro Adventure is the title of a series of books for young adult readers, published by Scholastic, Inc. during the 1980s. Created by Eileen Buckholtz and Ruth Glick, the YA series combined adventure stories with computer activities.

 The books are noted for the inclusion of short BASIC type-in programs related to the plot of the story that the reader could type into their computers, and also for the use of second-person narration (rather like the Choose Your Own Adventure series, though unlike those, Micro Adventure storylines could not be influenced by the decisions of the reader).

Through the second-person narration, the reader took the part of Orion, a computer expert and agent for the Adventure Connection Team, and followed the action in the continuing struggle against ACT’s nemesis, BRUTE (Bureau of Random Unlawful Terror and Evil).

The plots generally resembled those typically found in other works of the secret agent/adventure genre, ranging from sabotage aboard a space station to android doubles of the President of the United States, but differ from other works for their different approach to twists, and a lack of oversimplification.

Most of the programs, even “shoot-em-up” games, were tailored towards novice programmers and designed to be small (none were over 2K in file size, a must given the limitations of some personal computers available at the time, such as the TI-99/4A). Instructions were included on how to &quot;tweak&quot; the programs to make them run on many popular home computers of the time.

As a bonus, an appendix to each book gave step-by-step analyses of each of the programs in that particular book as a method of teaching simple programming theory and construction.

In 2017, Auri Rahimzadeh created a website to read the books and enter their programs in an on-page emulator.

<text>Concordia Language Villages (CLV), previously the International Language Villages, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Moorhead, Minnesota which operates a language and cultural immersion program, sponsored by the Concordia College. Languages (15 as of 2023) are taught in summer camps, called &quot;villages&quot;. School-year weekend programs are also offered, mostly for Spanish, French, and German. Annually, the program is attended by over 13,000 young people, aged 7–18, from every state of the US, as well as Canada and 31 other countries. It was founded in 1961.

==Villages==

There are architecturally and culturally authentic village sites (Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, and Korean) located near Bemidji, Minnesota on Turtle River Lake. There are also leased sites throughout Minnesota, as well as abroad in Switzerland and China.

The road connecting the permanent villages at Turtle River Lake to the county road was purposefully constructed to be winding, to simulate the long trip to the target cultures represented at the villages. The original plans for these villages included a train to link all of the villages. Although this idea was scrapped, aspects of it still remain in several buildings. The German village&#x27;s four-story administration building resembles a German train station and is called the Bahnhof (&quot;train station&quot;). The dining hall at Salolampi, the Finnish language village, is modeled after a famous Finnish train station. Additionally, the Turtle River Lake site has a World Inc. Peace Site with peace poles in the village languages at its heart, near the Norwegian village, Skogfjorden and the Bemidji and Turtle River Lake sites have European road signs in kilometers per hour (imported from Germany, not replications).

Several immigrant buildings have been moved to the permanent sites to show villagers what life was like for early European immigrants. The immigrant cabins at the Norwegian village are original to the site. The German &quot;Haus Sonnenaufgang&quot; was first moved from New Ulm, Minnesota to sit next to the Norwegian ones, but was moved sometime in the early 1990s to the German village near Bemidji, Minnesota.
CLV consists of 15 villages:
* German: Waldsee (est. 1961)
* French: Lac du Bois or Les Voyageurs (est. 1962)
* Spanish: El Lago Del Bosque (est. 1963)
* Norwegian: Skogfjorden (est. 1963)
* Russian: Lesnoe Ozero (Лесное озеро) (est. 1966)
* Swedish: Sjölunden (est. 1975)
* Finnish: Salolampi (est. 1978)
* Danish: Skovsøen (est. 1982)
* Chinese: Sen Lin Hu (森林湖) (est. 1984)
* Japanese: Mori no Ike (森の池) (est. 1988)
* English: Hometown, USA and Hometown, Europe (est. 1999)
* Korean: Sup sogǔi Hosu () (est. 1999)
* Italian: Lago del Bosco (est. 2003)
* Arabic: Al-Wāḥa (الواحة) (est. 2006)
* Portuguese: Mar e Floresta (est. 2008)

Each village is named &quot;Lake of the Woods&quot; in its language (as the villages are situated in the woods next to a lake) with the exception of the English villages &quot;Hometown, USA&quot; and &quot;Hometown, Europe&quot;, the Portuguese village &quot;Mar e Floresta&quot; (meaning &quot;Sea and Forest&quot;), and the Arabic village &quot;Al-Wāḥa&quot; (meaning &quot;the oasis&quot;). The Japanese village &quot;Mori no Ike&quot; translates to &quot;Pond of the Forest,&quot; but this name was chosen in lieu of the more-literal translation (which would use 林 &quot;hayashi&quot; &#x27;woods&#x27; and 湖 &quot;mizuumi&quot; &#x27;lake&#x27;) for length and ease of pronunciation.

===Village culture===
Villagers use CLV-issued &quot;passport&quot; booklets to manage their camp bank account and familiarize themselves with the use of a real-life passport. Villagers also go through &quot;customs&quot; upon arrival, which includes the storage of phones or other devices with internet connection, non-target language literature, and food (perishable items are disposed of).

Each language village site has numerous traditions, many of which are related to meals and songs. Meal presentations, in which each food and its name are presented in a short skit before each meal, are a language tool implemented by almost all programs. Many villages also put on a restaurant night for villagers to practice going out using their target language. Restaurants will often be fancy affairs that tend to represent international cuisine and languages that are not represented by the villages, such as Vietnamese, Indian, Thai, or Tibetan.

The cuisine in most villages reflect the ethnic cuisines of the target language. At Waldsee, this means that German regional food, Austrian, Swiss and common import foods like Turkish döner kebab are served. At Lac du Bois, foods of Africa and the Caribbean may be included.

The fusion of American and foreign cultures gives rise to linguistic phenomenon referred to as &quot;Franglais&quot; (French and anglais) or &quot;Denglish&quot; (Deutsch and English), depending on the languages in contact. Examples include &quot;Je need a couteau&quot; (&quot;I need a knife&quot;) or &quot;What did you seh at the Kino?&quot; (&quot;What did you see at the movie theatre?&quot;). Villagers at every camp employ a unique variety of code-switching with English and the target language. Site buildings are given names in the target language, are rarely referred to with their English names, even when speaking English. Additionally, some words have been invented by native-speaking staff members for concepts that are not native to the target cultures but daily words in camp life, such as &quot;chipmunk&quot;, &quot;poison ivy&quot;, and &quot;mosquito repellent&quot;.

===Village activities===
A typical day at one of the Villages includes cultural and typical summer camp activities. In the target language, villagers might go canoeing, create art projects, play traditional music, practice yoga, play ping pong, or make a film. Camp songs and daily skits are an integral part of the village experience, including at mealtimes, as are jokes, games, and weekend dances, all of which surround campers with the language.

Villagers may sign up for two-week or four-week programs, the latter of which are accredited academic programs which gives students high school credit via &quot;a thematic curriculum, experiential immersion techniques and performance-based assessments.&quot; To earn the 180 hours to gain credit at a high school, villagers attend multiple structured classes during the day with a higher level of focus on reading, writing, listening, and conversation. &quot;Credit villagers&quot;, as they are often referred to in English, are still able to participate in all-camp activities such as evening programs, sports, arts and crafts, and other unique offerings in each village.

==Programs==

Concordia Language Villages has offered a 10-day, 4-credit graduate level course for teachers in second languages and immersion, along with various adult programs to serve its diverse audience, not all of which are offered in every language. High school credit abroad programs were formerly offered in China, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Cameroon, and Argentina.

During the summer, CLV serves youth with villages in the United States. Villagers can stay for one week, two weeks, or four week programs, and it is possible to earn high school or college credit for the time spent being immersed in the language. Wilderness programs during the summer offer additional opportunities to spend time in the outdoors of Minnesota for those who enjoy the environment, exploration, and camping. Many camps also offer other themed programs, such as French African or Swiss culture (which is a blend of the German, French, and Italian villages) or the Middle Ages in combination with theatre. Summer day camps are offered for younger learners who live in the area, and family week programs during the summer serve entire families, even those with young children.

Between September and June, CLV offers weeks and weekends of immersion for adults, families, teachers, and school groups. These programs meet over weekends and long weekends, and each school year has a theme for its weekend.

===International Day===

During each half of the summer, all the camps within driving distance travel to Waldsee, the German camp, for a day-long festival of cultures called International Day, or I-Day. The camps bring out their wares and each has a booth of ethnic food to share, and each camp prepares a short closing performance to share. Each year has a different theme. Additionally, campers in every village learn a choreographed dance to the year&#x27;s &quot;I-Day song&quot; during the two weeks preceding I-Day. This is a song from a language not covered by the camps; everyone dances to it together during the festival. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, International Day has been postponed until further notice.

===International patronage granted===

His Majesty King Harald V of Norway has granted royal patronage to Skogfjorden, the Norwegian Language Village. Patronage is an affirmation from the Royal Family of Norway of the quality educational programming of Concordia Language Villages.

In 2009, Tove Irene Dahl, the dean of Skogfjorden, was named a Knight of the First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, by His Majesty King Harald V of Norway for the advancement of Norwegian language and culture in the United States.

Johannes Rau, former President of the Federal Republic of Germany has also granted personal patronage to Waldsee, the German Language Village. This patronage is symbolic of the strong bonds between the people of Germany and Concordia Language Villages.

<doc id="1203656" wikidata="Q6918169" url="?curid=1203656" title="Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three">
<text>Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three (MTBRon 3) was a United States Navy squadron based at Naval Base Cavite, Cavite, Philippines, from September 1941 to December 1941. It was commanded by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley and made up of six motor torpedo boats: &quot;PT-31&quot;, &quot;PT-32&quot;, &quot;PT-33&quot;, &quot;PT-34&quot;, &quot;PT-35&quot;, and &quot;PT-41&quot;, the last as the squadron flagship. The other six boats of the squadron remained at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and were there when war broke out, eventually being shipped to the Solomons.

== History ==
After the outbreak of hostilities between the United States and Japan on 7 December 1941, the squadron moved from Cavite to Sisiman Bay on the Bataan Peninsula with the requisitioned tug &quot;Trabajador&quot; as tender, where it helped in the defense of Bataan and Corregidor during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. &quot;PT-31&quot; and &quot;PT-33&quot; were sunk during the battle. The desired practice was for boats to patrol in pairs in the event one PT needed assistance from another. The critical shortage of spares and fuel often prevented such pairing so that one of the small converted patrol yachts, , &quot;Perry&quot;, or , or one of the two old destroyers, or , were used to accompany a single PT on patrol.
On 11 March 1942, the remaining boats of the squadron transported General Douglas MacArthur and several high-ranking officers from Corregidor to Mindanao, an act which earned every member of the squadron the Silver Star. &quot;PT-32&quot; was scuttled during this mission, reducing the squadron to three boats: &quot;PT-41&quot;, &quot;PT-34&quot;, and &quot;PT-35&quot;.

These three boats were based at Mindanao until mid-April 1942, where two of them (&quot;PT-41&quot; and &quot;PT-34&quot;) attacked the , scoring at least one hit. This was to be the squadron&#x27;s last action: &quot;PT-34&quot; was destroyed by Japanese aircraft, &quot;PT-35&quot; had to be scuttled to avoid capture, and &quot;PT-41&quot; was commandeered by the U.S. Army to defend Lake Lanao. She was scuttled as well, three days after transfer.

Bulkeley and three other officers were later flown to safety on MacArthur&#x27;s orders, with a fifth officer joining them shortly after. These five officers were all that remained of this squadron as a result. Three officers and fifteen enlisted men were killed in action or died as prisoners of war, seven evaded capture as guerrillas on Leyte, and 38 POWs were liberated after the war.

The squadron&#x27;s exploits were immortalized in the book and film &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;. Bulkeley was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Philippine Distinguished Conduct Star, and the Silver Star during his command of the squadron, making him one of the most decorated U.S. naval officers of World War II.

On 27 July 1942 Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Two was transferred to MTBRon 3 and was designated MTBRON 3(2). They were commanded by Lcdr. Alan R. Montgomery. In late 1942 the Squadron shipped for Tulagi with six 77&#x27; Elco boats and six 80&#x27; Elco boats. They were the first PTs in the Solomons. Their exploits in The Slot are historic. At the end of the Solomon&#x27;s campaign MTBRon 3(2) was decommissioned. The Squadron was recommissioned in the Atlantic as MTBRON 2(2).

<text>Battle for Armageddon is a strategic boardgame produced by Games Workshop. Unlike the many Games Workshop games that use miniatures, this is a more traditional counter and board game.

The game represents the Second War for Armageddon, a war in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The conflict is between the invading Orks under the leadership of the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka and the Imperial world of Armageddon&#x27;s defence forces under the joint command of Herman von Strab, Overlord of Armageddon; Commander Dante of the Blood Angels; and Imperial Commissar Yarrick. Concentrating on the Armageddon Secundus region of the planet, the game is a mixture of strategy and resource management.

The game draws heavily on World War II Eastern Front sources, with the Orks taking the place of German troops and the Imperium being the Russians. It compares favourably with other Eastern Front counter wargames, emphasising the Germans (Orks) need to secure an early decisive victory otherwise they have to settle for a long drawn out defeat (or draw at the very best) and the hands of the ever increasing Russian (Imperium) forces.

The game was originally released as a boxed game, while the expansion, &quot;Chaos Attacks&quot; focused on the first war for Armageddon that takes place 300 years before Ghazghkull made his first foray into the Armageddon system.

Both games were later released for free in pdf format by Games Workshop to promote their 3rd War for Armageddon Warhammer 40,000 campaign.

The characters of Ghazghkull and Yarrick were later given rules for use in Warhammer 40,000 and Space Marine.

The game was one of 4 released using the same or similar principles - the others including &quot;Horus Heresy&quot; and &quot;Doom of the Eldar&quot;

<text>Phillips Recording Service is the short name widely used to refer to the Sam C. Phillips Recording Studio established in 1960 by Sun Records and Memphis Recording Service founder Sam Phillips at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee to replace the older, smaller Memphis Recording Service studio.

==Memphis studio== 
In July 1958, feeling that his Memphis Recording Service/Sun Studio was becoming outdated and too small to accommodate the needs of the record labels and publishing companies of the growing Sam Phillips Recording Organization, Sam Phillips bought a property at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, just a few blocks from Sun Studio. The building, which had previously housed a Midas Muffler shop and a bakery, was gutted to build two recording studios on the ground floor, A&amp;R and promotion offices on the second floor, and offices for accounting, publishing, and Phillips himself on the third floor. The new studio, Sam Phillips Recording Service, opened in 1960, with Scotty Moore being named studio manager. In 1965, Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs recorded their hit song &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; at the studio.

By the end of the 1960s, Sam Phillips mostly retired from the recording business, and his sons Knox and Jerry worked in the studio, which hosted sessions by The Yardbirds, Willie Nelson, Amazing Rhythm Aces, Alex Chilton, Bobby Doyle, John Prine, and The Cramps. Knox Phillips managed the studio until his death on April 13, 2020. The studio, still an analog-based facility utilizing much of its original equipment from the 1960s, is still owned and operated by the Sam Phillips family.

==Other locations==
In the early 1960s, Phillips Recording also had a short-lived demo studio in Tupelo, Mississippi, as well as a studio in Nashville. The Sam Phillips Recording Service of Nashville was opened in 1961 in the top floor of the Cumberland Building, a former Masonic Lodge at 315 Seventh Avenue North, next to the WSM radio studio. Notable songs produced at this studio include Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27; 1961 version of &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;, The Dixiebelles 1963 song &quot;(Down at) Papa Joe&#x27;s&quot;, the 1963 version of &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; that would become Boots Randolph&#x27;s signature song, and Ronny &amp; the Daytonas hit 1964 song &quot;G.T.O&quot;. In 1962, producer Billy Sherrill was hired to manage the studio at the start of his career. Sherrill moved to Epic Records the following year, and Phillips sold the studio to Monument Records and renamed the Fred Foster Sound Studio in 1964.

<text>Inkallaqta (Quechua &quot;inka&quot; Inca, &quot;llaqta&quot; place (village, town, city, country, nation), &quot;Inca place&quot;, Hispanicized spellings &quot;Incallacta, Incallajta, Incallakta, Inkallajta, Inkallakta&quot;) is a monumental Inca site in central Bolivia. It is located in the Cochabamba Department, Carrasco Province, Pocona Municipality, approximately 130 kilometers east of Cochabamba. It was most recently excavated by Larry Coben. He believes that the site was used to perform rites for the ceremonial calendar. The site has several important structures such as the Kallanka. It was the largest single roofed room in the western hemisphere when it was built, and measures 78 by 25 meters. There&#x27;s also an ushnu or a ritual platform on the site. The Torreon of Inkallaqta is also located on this site. Positioned on the western side of the site this six sided structure supposedly had calendrical or astronomical significance. There is a zigzag wall immediately north of the site which is meant to mark and protect it.

== World Heritage Status ==
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 1, 2003, in the Cultural category.

== Opera ==
There is also an opera called &quot;Incallajta&quot; in honor of these ruins. The libretto was written by Norma Méndez de Paz, the music was composed by Atiliano Auza León. It is the first Bolivian opera. The premiere was in La Paz, Bolivia in 1980. It will have its reinstatement in September 2010, in Cochabamba, in honor of the Bicentenary of this city. Gastón Paz Zegarra, a recognized Bolivian baritone represented the role of Sovereign Inca, a role that will repeat in the new version of this opera.

<text>Tumbleweed Connection is the third studio album by English singer-songwriter Elton John. It was recorded at Trident Studios, London, in March 1970, and released in October 1970 in the UK and January 1971 in the US. It is a concept album based on country and western and Americana themes. All songs are written by John and Bernie Taupin, with the exception of &quot;Love Song&quot; by Lesley Duncan.

In 2012, &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; was ranked number 458 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In the US, it was certified gold in March 1971 and platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA.

==Background==
Co-writer Bernie Taupin said of the album, &quot;Everybody thinks that I was influenced by Americana and by seeing America first hand, but we wrote and recorded the album before we&#x27;d even been to the States. It was totally influenced by The Band&#x27;s album &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; and Robbie Robertson&#x27;s songs. I&#x27;ve always loved Americana, and I loved American Westerns. I&#x27;ve always said that &#x27;El Paso&#x27; was the song that made me want to write songs, it was the perfect meshing of melody and storyline, and I thought that here was something that married rhythms and the written word completely.&quot; John has remarked, &quot;Lyrically and melodically, that&#x27;s probably one of our most perfect albums. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any song on there that doesn&#x27;t melodically fit the lyric.&quot;

Basic tracks for three of the album&#x27;s titles, &quot;Come Down in Time&quot;, &quot;Country Comfort&quot; and &quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot;, were recorded at Trident during the sessions for the previous LP, &quot;Elton John&quot;, with overdubs completed for &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;. An early version of &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;, featuring Mick Ronson on electric guitar, was also recorded during the sessions for the album. It was released on several albums and reissues of &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, though the track was ultimately re-recorded for the &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; album.

Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson appear for the first time together on this album as the rhythm section on &quot;Amoreena&quot;. Olsson had played on one track on &quot;Empty Sky&quot; for John in 1969. It is Murray&#x27;s first appearance on an Elton John album. In addition to several studio players who also performed on John&#x27;s previous self-titled second album, several tracks feature backing musicians from the band Hookfoot, who were also his DJM Records label mates. Hookfoot guitarist Caleb Quaye and drummer Roger Pope had also appeared on John&#x27;s &quot;Empty Sky&quot; album.

No singles were released from the album in the US by either DJM or John&#x27;s US distributor, Universal Records, but &quot;Country Comfort&quot; (b/w &quot;Love Song&quot;) was released as a single in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. It peaked at No. 15 in New Zealand, and did not chart in the other two territories it was released in.

==Artwork==
The wraparound cover photo for the album was taken at Sheffield Park railway station in Sussex, approximately south of London on the Bluebell Railway. Photographer Ian Digby Ovens captured John (seated to the right in the photo but appearing to the left on the front cover, shown above) and Taupin (standing to the left, on the back cover) in front of the late-nineteenth-century station, to represent the album&#x27;s rural Americana concept despite the English location. Additional photos were taken from the interior of a train on the line for the album liner notes and libretto.

In August 2020, the Bluebell Railway announced that, to mark the 50th anniversary of the release of the album, it had restored the station to look as it did when the cover photo was taken, giving people an opportunity to re-create the scene in their own photos.

== Reception ==


The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In the US, it was certified gold in March 1971 and platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA. The album sold very quickly in the US, debuting at number 28 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top LPs, an unusually high debut for a new artist at the time, and reached its peak position in just four weeks.

In 2012, &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; was ranked number 458 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

&quot;Half of the songs don&#x27;t follow conventional pop song structures; instead, they flow between verses and vague choruses. These experiments are remarkably successful, primarily because Taupin&#x27;s lyrics are evocative and John&#x27;s melodic sense is at its best.&quot;

Robert Christgau wrote in his 1981 &quot;Record Guide&quot;: &quot;good melodies and bad Westerns on it. Why do people believe that these latter qualify as songpoems?&quot; (Note: There&#x27;s an earlier Christgau review of the album, written in 1970 for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;). Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke wrote: &quot;1971’s &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; needs no improvement; it is one of the best country-rock albums ever written by London cowboys.&quot;

Robert Hillburn wrote for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;&quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; is that near-perfect album that artists often spend a whole career trying to produce.&quot; Dave DiMartino wrote for &quot;Yahoo! Music&quot;: &quot;A step up from the slightly more overtly commercial &quot;Elton John&quot;... &quot;Tumbleweed&quot; is beautifully recorded and filled with very fine songs... Bordering on classic status.&quot;

== &quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot; ==
&quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot;, the tenth and final track on &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, is the most enduring and frequently played song from the album, the only one played by John on his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour in 2022–23. It was one of the very few non-singles on the Farewell Tour setlist, being played every night. 

===Song information===
&quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot; is musically driven by the story told by Bernie Taupin&#x27;s lyrics, as is common in John/Taupin collaborations.

The lyrics themselves, while telling a simple story, are vague enough to be open to interpretation. Ostensibly the story is that of a poor community oppressed by a rich and powerful force, and the narrator, driven by some sort of revelation, has decided to take direct action to remedy the situation. However, his attempt fails and he is &quot;taken away&quot;, presumably to meet his fate, and justifies his actions as an attempt to defend his family.

The music reflects this narrative structure by starting with a slow piano introduction and the telling of the hero&#x27;s situation and his progress towards direct action; the middle section, which is faster, jazzier and brings in full instrumentation, can be read as an interpretation of the actual struggle in which the hero engages. Finally, the struggle has ended and the music returns to its initial understated form, reflecting the eventual defeat of the hero. The song ends with a restatement of the middle section while it fades out.

In the premiere episode of Elvis Costello&#x27;s show &quot;&quot;, John cited Laura Nyro as an influence on, among other things, the unusual structure and rhythm changes of this song in particular.

This is one of the most musically complicated works of John&#x27;s career. The key changes four times before returning to the original opening chord sequence at the half-way mark. It has always been quite a fan favorite, and John has frequently performed it live over the last 40 years: 

* John&#x27;s first live album, the WABC radio broadcast &quot;11-17-70&quot;, concludes with a version (running 18:10), interpolating Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot; and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; 
* The song was a regular feature of the 1974 US and UK tours, with a version from the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; in London, included in the album &quot;Here and There&quot;
* Elton&#x27;s longest and most complex standalone jam of &quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot; (lasting 10:17) was in the Christmas Eve 1974 performance broadcast live on the BBC from Hammersmith Odeon in London, much bootlegged as &quot;Ol&#x27; Pink Eyes Is Back&quot; and &quot;Just Like Strange Rain&quot; (listen here at timecode 9:43).
* A more conventional rendition was recorded in December 1986 and released on &quot;Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra&quot;.

===Cover versions===
* In 1991, the song was covered by Phil Collins for the tribute album &quot;Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin&quot;.
* In 2002, the song was recorded by Toto for their album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;.

<doc id="1203668" wikidata="Q4328346" url="?curid=1203668" title="The Newark Museum of Art">
<text>The Newark Museum of Art, formerly known as the Newark Museum, in Newark, Essex County, New Jersey is the state&#x27;s largest museum. It holds major collections of American art, decorative arts, contemporary art, and arts of Asia (including a large collection of Tibetan art), Africa, the Americas, and the ancient world. Its extensive collections of American art include works by Hiram Powers, Thomas Cole, John Singer Sargent, Albert Bierstadt, Frederick Church, Childe Hassam, Mary Cassatt, Edward Hopper, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Joseph Stella, Tony Smith and Frank Stella.

In addition to its extensive art collections, The Newark Museum of Art is dedicated to natural science. It includes the Dreyfuss Planetarium and the Victoria Hall of Science which highlights selections from the museum&#x27;s 70,000 specimen Natural Science Collection. The Alice Ransom Dreyfuss Memorial Garden, located behind the museum, houses numerous works of contemporary sculpture and is the setting for community programs, concerts and performances. The garden is also home to a 1784 old stone schoolhouse and the Newark Fire Museum.

The museum was founded in 1909 by librarian and reformer John Cotton Dana. As the charter described it, the purpose was &quot;to establish in the City of Newark, New Jersey, a museum for the reception and exhibition of articles of art, science, history and technology, and for the encouragement of the study of the arts and sciences.&quot; The kernel of the museum was a collection of Japanese prints, silks, and porcelains assembled by a Newark pharmacist.

Originally located on the fourth floor of the Newark Public Library, the museum moved into its own purpose-built structure in the 1920s on Washington Park after a gift by Louis Bamberger. It was designed by Jarvis Hunt, who also designed Bamberger&#x27;s flagship Newark store. Since then, the museum has expanded several times, to the south into the red brick former YMCA and to the north into the 1885 Ballantine House, by a four-year, $23 million renovation. In 1990, the museum expanded to the west into an existing acquired building. At that time much of the museum, including the new addition, was redesigned by Michael Graves.

The museum had a mini-zoo with small animals for some twenty years, until August 2010.

For the security of climate-sensitive artwork, the museum closed its front entrance to the public in 1997 to minimize the effects of temperature and humidity changes. However, in February 2018, after extensive renovation and the construction of a ramp for disabled access, the front doors were reopened.

On November 6, 2019, the museum changed its name to &quot;The Newark Museum of Art&quot; to highlight the focus of the museum on its art collection which was ranked 12th in the country.

The Newark Black Film Festival was founded in conjunction with the Museum and was formerly held every summer on the Museum campus.

The museum is open daily from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

==Tibetan collections==
The museum&#x27;s Tibetan art galleries are considered among the best in the world. The collection was purchased from Christian missionaries in the early twentieth century. The Tibetan galleries have an in-situ Buddhist altar that the Dalai Lama has consecrated.

In 1910, Albert L. Shelton, a missionary to Tibet, agreed to lend his collection of Tibetan art to Edward N. Crane, a Newark Museum trustee, for a temporary exhibition at the museum. The exhibition, the first dedicated Tibetan art exhibition in the world, ran in 1911 with a success. However, Crane died in the same year. His wife and brother bought the collection from Shelton and donated it to the museum to create a permanent collection in Crane&#x27;s memory. The museum also commissioned Shelton to bring back more artifacts to add to its collection between 1913 and 1920.

Before the year 1935, the Tibetan art artifacts were presented individually, accompanied by respective descriptions, employing a format consistent with that observed in various art collections. This mode of presentation shared similarities with practices observed in other museums housing Tibetan collections such as the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum in London. In 1935, the Newark Museum constructed a temporary altar to provide a meaningful setting for its collection. The altar was very well received by the visitors and the decision was made to keep as a permanent setting. Subsequently, Tibetan monks and other dignitaries visited the museum and had sanctified the altar space.

The museum continued to acquire more objects to its collection until the 1940s which amassed more than 5,000 objects including paintings, sculptures, ritual objects, fine textiles and decorative arts.

In the mid-1980s, the &quot;Tibet, the Living Tradition&quot; project at the museum involved a renovation and expansion to have the installation of eight permanent galleries. The original altar was de-consecration by the Venerable Ganden Tri Rinpoche in January 1988. It was retained to be enclosed in the cavity of the new altar. The new altar was created by Tibetan artist-in-residence, Phuntsok Dorje, between 1989 and 1990. The new altar was consecrated by the 14th Dalai Lama in 1990. , the museum housed over 5,500 Tibetan art artifacts establishing as the largest and most distinctive collection in the Western Hemisphere.

In addition to the Tibetan art, the museum houses a significant depository of historical photographs and films of Tibet. There are more than 2,500 images taken between 1904 and 1949, and hours of film footage between 1935 and 1937 in its collection.

==The Ballantine House==
The Ballantine house is a preserved and restored house from the Victorian Era, designed by architect George Edward Harney. It was home to John Holme Ballantine, his wife, Jeannette, and their children, John, Robert, Alice, and Percy. Mr. Ballantine owned and ran a brewery in the Ironbound section of Newark. The house originally had twenty-seven rooms and three floors. In 1937, the Newark Museum bought the house and has since restored it to serve as galleries for the extensive decorative arts collections.

<text>Hope UK is a United Kingdom Christian charity based in London, England, which educates children and young people about drug and alcohol abuse. Local meetings started in 1847 and a formal organisation was established in 1855 with the name The United Kingdom Band of Hope Union.

==Band of Hope==
The Band of Hope was first proposed by Rev. Jabez Tunnicliff, who was a Baptist minister in Leeds, following the death in June 1847 of a young man whose life was cut short by alcohol. While working in Leeds, Tunnicliff had become an advocate for total abstinence from alcohol. In the autumn of 1847, with the help of other temperance workers including Anne Jane Carlile, the Band of Hope was founded. Its objective was to teach children the importance and principles of sobriety and teetotalism. In 1855, a national organisation was formed amidst an explosion of Band of Hope work. Meetings were held in churches throughout the UK and included Christian teaching.

Set up in an era when alcoholic drinks was generally viewed as a necessity of life, next only to food and water, the Band of Hope and other temperance organisations fought to counteract the influence of pubs and brewers, with the specific intention of rescuing &#x27;unfortunates&#x27; whose lives had been blighted by drink and teach complete abstinence.

Christians and Temperance Societies saw this as a way of providing activities for children that encouraged them to avoid alcohol problems. Alcohol-free premises were established, rallies, marches and demonstrations were mounted to oppose the &quot;evils&quot; of hard liquor that were attended by thousands of supporters, and coffee taverns were established to keep teetotalers on the straight and narrow path.

&quot;Signing the pledge&quot; was one of the innovative features. The pledge was a promise not to drink alcohol and millions of people signed up. There were also lectures that were illustrated by magic lantern, the technological equivalent to present day computerised PowerPoint displays, and noted personalities were invited to speak at public meetings in support of the cause. Guy Aldred, the boy preacher was an active propagandist for the &quot;Band of Hope&quot;, before focussing his activities on Anarchist-Communist politics.

By 1897, its estimated membership was over 3 million. Band of Hope also had chapters in Australia prior to World War I. By the early 1950s, however, the temperance movement had all but succumbed to a changing society and cultural habits. Lack of support for the Band of Hope eventually brought about their transformation into Hope UK.

Hope UK remains concerned with children&#x27;s welfare, giving priority to the development of resources and training for parents and children&#x27;s workers of many kinds. The charity also attempts to persuade churches and other Christian organisations to include drugs awareness work within their programmes and play their part in helping to reduce the UK&#x27;s alcohol and other drugs problems. Hope UK is a member of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).

==Training==

The charity provides training courses across the UK, ranging from short workshops to two-day Open College Network (OCN) accredited courses.

Hope UK&#x27;s drug educators undergo a 120-hour OCN accredited course to prepare them for leading drug awareness sessions and training courses. This course is also available for those who want to provide drug education as part of their own work.

The charity provides a two-day OCN-accredited &quot;Young People, Drugs and the Role of the Youth Worker&quot; course for people that work with children and young people. It also provides &quot;Drug Prevention for Family Workers&quot;, a two-day course for those working in family centres, with parents, or for Children&#x27;s or Community Development workers.

Sessions for Church Workers include the application of faith principles to drug issues; Church drug policies and practice; and suggested action by churches for and with their communities. Hope UK&#x27;s Church Leaders’ Pack is also available as a paper resource.

<doc id="1203694" wikidata="Q2900560" url="?curid=1203694" title="Niwa Nagahide">
<text>, also known as &#x27; (), his other legal alias was &#x27; (), was a Japanese samurai of the Sengoku through Azuchi-Momoyama periods of the 16th century. He served as senior retainer to the Oda clan, and was eventually a daimyō in his own right. Going on to fight in the Oda clan&#x27;s major campaigns, including Mino Campaign 1567, Omi Campaign 1568, the Honganji Campaign from 1570 to 1580, and Iga Campaign 1581, he was named one of the administrators of Kyoto after Nobunaga entered that city in 1568.

==Early life==
Nagahide was born in what is now Nishi-ku, Nagoya, but then part of Aichi District, Owari Province. From his youth, Nagahide served Oda Nobunaga and became one of his senior retainers, He stayed by Nobunaga&#x27;s side when his brother defied him during the Battle of Inō in 1555 and also Battle of Ukino 1558.

==Military life==
In 1560, Nagahide also had military service during the Battle of Okehazama, but he wasn&#x27;t a part of the main strike force.

According to the Nobunaga Kōki, he served in the Battle of Inabayama 1567, he was part of Nobunaga&#x27;s main division against Saitō Tatsuoki.

In 1568, during the Omi campaign, he contributed in the conquest of Battle of Kannonji castle and was a part of Nobunaga&#x27;s personal formation. His participation made him favored by Nobunaga. 
He served in the Battle of Anegawa 1570 against the Azai-Asakura clan, and the Hongan-ji campaign from 1570–1580.

In February 1571, Nagahide entered Sawayama Castle after Isono Kazumasa moved out, and since then he was active as a castle general with Kawajiri Hidetaka. In September 1571, after Nobunaga ordered for the Tendai Temple affiliated with Enryaku-ji at Mt. Hiei to be burned down, Nagahide and Hidetaka burned down Saimyōji temple.

Nagahide also served in the Siege of Ichijodani Castle 1573, in the Battle of Nagashino 1575 against Takeda clan and the Battle of Tedorigawa 1577 under Shibata Katsuie against Uesugi Kenshin.

When he wasn&#x27;t in battle, he was aiding Nobunaga&#x27;s conquests by taking care of political affairs and had responsibility for constructing Azuchi Castle, which began in 1576 and was completed in 1579. One of the characters of his family name was said to have been granted for the Hashiba name for Hideyoshi. His participation made him favored by Nobunaga, among many of other deeds. The extent of Nobunaga&#x27;s trust can be seen by the fact that Nagahide married Nobunaga&#x27;s niece, while his son was Niwa Nagashige. These services let Nagahide rule over the fief of Obama Domain in Wakasa Province, and Sawayama Castle in Ōmi Province.

In 1581, in a military parade held at Kyoto before the eyes of the Emperor as well as foreign missionaries, Nagahide was given the honor of leading the procession. In the same year, he fought in second Tensho Iga War against Iga inhabitants.

In 1582, as Oda Nobutaka&#x27;s second in command, Nagahide launched a campaign on Shikoku, but before he made any progress, Nobunaga died during an attack by Akechi Mitsuhide. Nagahide abandoned the campaign and turned back to join Hashiba Hideyoshi in avenging Nobunaga&#x27;s death by killing Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki. Later, at the subsequent meeting in Kiyosu Castle where the future of the Oda clan was discussed, Nagahide supported Hideyoshi&#x27;s position.

In 1583, Nagahide assisted Hideyoshi at the Battle of Shizugatake and gained Echizen Province and Kaga Province to rule, worth over 1,230,000 koku. He thus became one of the most powerful retainers and daimyō.

==Death==
Nagahide died of illness in 1585. There is a conflicting record that Nagahide had not died of an illness, but on seeing Hideyoshi gather more power and eclipsing the Oda clan Nagahide had so long served, he felt that he had not lived up for the good of Nobunaga and the Oda clan as a whole and committed suicide.

His son Niwa Nagashige later became lord of Shirakawa Castle in northern Japan, and by the time of Nagahide&#x27;s grandson Niwa Mitsushige, the family&#x27;s 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; landholding was moved to Nihonmatsu, where they remained for the duration of the Edo Period.

==Azamaru sword==
According to the Nobunaga Kōki, Nagahide was presented the treasured sword &quot;Azamaru&quot;, initially held by Taira Kagekiyo. Another previous owner, Kageyama Kazukage, was blinded during the Siege of Ôgaki castle in 1547, and the next owner, Niwa Nagahide, began having eye trouble, and so the sword was believed to be cursed. Nagahide donated the sword to the Atsuta shrine, in order to be freed from the curse. After the donation, his eye troubles went away.

<doc id="1203705" wikidata="Q701273" url="?curid=1203705" title="Jinhan confederacy">
<text>Jinhan (; ) was a loose confederacy of chiefdoms that existed from around the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE in the southern Korean Peninsula, to the east of the Nakdong River valley, Gyeongsang Province. Jinhan was one of the Samhan (or &quot;Three Hans&quot;), along with Byeonhan and Mahan. Apparently descending from the Jin state of southern Korea, Jinhan was absorbed by the later Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Jinhan (辰韓)&quot; is believed to be a combination of Old Korean words. &quot;Jin (진)&quot; in native Korean meant &quot;East&quot; while &quot;Han (한)&quot; meant &quot;big&quot;, giving the meaning of Jinhan, the &quot;Big Nation of the East&quot;.

As part of the Samhan, Mahan meant &quot;Big Nation of the South&quot; and Byeonhan meant &quot;Big Nation of Shimmer&quot;.

==History==
Jinhan, like the other Samhan confederacies, arose out of the confusion and migration following the fall of Wiman Joseon in 108 BCE.

A claim found in the Chinese annals, &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot; state that refugees from the Lelang area found Jinhan after political turmoil of the Qin dynasty at the end of the 3rd century BCE and carried over the name &quot;Qin/秦&quot;. However, due to the dates overlapping with Jin state (4th~2nd century BCE) and no Korean historical documents backing this claim, it is mostly regarded as a false rumor as the Samhan kingdoms (including Jinhan) specifically claimed successorship over Jin (辰國) and not the Qin Dynasty (秦朝) (it is also noted that the claim found in the annals allude to a mention made by an elderly passerby of no social importance). The claim is further discredited as Korea&#x27;s &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; states that the first king of Silla (the kingdom that succeeded Jinhan) built the kingdom alongside the indigenous Koreans from Gojoseon. Such misconception had ultimately affected immigrants who hailed from Silla to Japan known as the Hata clan who were wrongfully labeled as descendants of the Qin Dynasty simply for being associated with Silla.

Book of Wei - Volume 30&#x27;s some part are record left by Wei envoy who visited &quot;Okjeo&quot; and &quot;Jinhan&quot; after the victory of the &quot;Goguryeo–Wei War&quot; and the &quot;Battle of Giryeong&quot; at the late 3rd century.

Thus, Jinhan&#x27;s 12 countries are records of quasi-independent countries that have weakened since the defeat of Silla during the Cheomhae Isageum era.

Before the 3rd century, it was presumed that there was no distinction between the Jinhan (辰韓) and Byeonhan (弁韓 or 弁辰).

It is said that the people of Jinhan and Byeonhan intermingled and immigrated quite frequently (雜居), ultimately making it difficult to differentiate the two states culturally.

==Culture==
Its relation to the earlier state of Jin is not clear, although the contemporary Chinese chronicle &quot;San Guo Zhi&quot; alleges that Jinhan was identical with Jin (while another record describes Jin as the predecessor of the Samhan as a whole). Jinhan and Byeonhan shared essentially the same culture, with varying religious customs, and apparently were not separated by a clear boundary.

Many of the archeological evidence found in the area lack distinguishable differences with the evidence found in the neighboring kingdoms, suggesting that the cultures were mostly similar across the southern part of the peninsula.

Little is known about the daily lives of the Jinhan people. The religion appears to have been shamanistic which played an important role in politics as well. Agriculture was heavily dominated by rice, but also included substantial rearing of livestock including horses, cattle, and chickens.

Similar to Byeonhan, infants born in Jinhan were made flat headed by pushing their skulls onto a flat rock. This practice is thought to have lasted up to the Gaya confederacy.

== Language ==
The language of Jinhan is thought to be the predecessor of the language of Silla, which in turn was the supposed ancestor of the modern Korean language.

However, due to multiple evidence stating that Silla, Baekje and Goguryeo spoke similar languages without a need of a translator, it can be deduced that the languages spoken in Jinhan bore close resemblance to languages spoken in countries such as Byeonhan and Mahan at the time. 

==Statelets==
According to the &quot;San Guo Zhi&quot;, Jinhan consisted of 12 statelets of 600 to 5000 families each divided from 6 statelets:

* Saro (사로국, 斯盧國), most powerful state in Jinhan, it is also called Seorabeol. In 503, Saro state renamed itself &quot;Silla&quot;.
* Gijeo (기저국, 己柢國), present-day Andong.
* Bulsa (불사국, 不斯國), present-day Changnyeong.
* Geun-gi (근기국, 勤耆國), present-day Pohang or Cheongdo.
* Nanmirimidong (난미리미동국, 難彌理彌凍國), present-day Miryang. It is also called &quot;Mirimidong&quot;.
* Yeomhae (염해국, 冉奚國), present-day Ulsan.
* Gunmi (군미국, 軍彌國), present-day Sacheon.
* Yeodam (여담국, 如湛國), present-day Gunwi.
* Horo (호로국, 戶路國), present-day Sangju.
* Juseon (주선국, 州鮮國), present-day Gyeongsan.
* Mayeon (마연국, 馬延國), present-day Miryang.
* U-yu (우유국, 優由國), present-day Cheongdo or Yeongdeok.

According to &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, the Silla Kingdom (around present-day Gyeongju), was founded by Bak Hyeokgeose in 57 BC, who united the six clans of Jinhan under his rule. The records are sparse and conflicting regarding the relationship of the names Jinhan, Saro, Seorabeol, and the later Silla kingdom.

==Location==
Most theories indicate that Jinhan was located in the area later occupied by the Silla kingdom: the Gyeongju Basin and adjacent Sea of Japan coast. It would have been neighbored by the Byeonhan confederacy on the southwest, and by the much larger Mahan confederacy on the west. On the north it would have been bounded by the Chinese commanderies and the small coastal state of Dongye. However, some scholars place Jinhan in the Han River valley, bounded by Mahan on the north and Byeonhan on the south.

<text>Kevin Brooks Eastman (born May 30, 1962) is an American comic book writer and artist best known for co-creating the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with Peter Laird. Eastman was also formerly the editor and publisher of the magazine &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Eastman was born in Portland, Maine. He attended Westbrook High School in Westbrook, Maine, with comic book illustrator Steve Lavigne. He grew up a comic book fan, with Jack Kirby as his idol and &quot;Kamandi&quot; as his favorite title of his.

In 1983, he worked in a restaurant while he searched for publishers for his comics. He met a waitress who was attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst and followed her to Northampton, Massachusetts. While searching for a local underground newspaper to publish his work, he began a professional relationship with Peter Laird, who worked in nearby Dover, New Hampshire, and the two collaborated for a short time on various comics projects.

In May 1984, Eastman and Laird self-published the first black &amp; white issue of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. The forty-page oversized comic had an initial print run of 3,275 copies and was largely funded by a $1,000 loan from Eastman&#x27;s uncle Quentin. It was published by the duo&#x27;s Mirage Studios, a name chosen because, as Eastman says, &quot;there wasn&#x27;t an actual studio, only kitchen tables and couches with lap boards.&quot; By September 1985, their first issue had received three additional printings.

==Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles==
Laird&#x27;s newspaper experience led to the two creating a four-page press kit, which included a story outline and artwork. They sent the press kit to 180 television and radio stations as well as to the Associated Press and United Press International. This led to widespread press coverage of both the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and Mirage Studios itself, creating a demand for the comic. With their second issue, Eastman and Laird&#x27;s &quot;Turtles&quot; comic began a quick rise to success, bringing in advance orders of 15,000 copies, five times the initial print run of the first issue. This earned Eastman and Laird a profit of $2,000 each and allowed them to become full-time comic book creators.

The &quot;Turtles&quot; phenomenon saw the duo invited to their first comics convention at the tenth annual Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1984, where they mingled with notable fandom celebrities like Larry Niven, Forrest J Ackerman and Fred Hembeck.

Their fifth issue of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; was released in November 1985, and was downsized to the more common American comics-format and size. The previous four issues were also reprinted in this size and format with new colored covers. Also in 1985, Solson Publications released &quot;How to Draw Eastman and Laird&#x27;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. Solson would follow this up with the six-issue &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Authorized Martial Arts Training Manual&quot; as well as one issue of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teach Karate&quot; volume in 1987.

===Licensing===
Mirage&#x27;s &quot;Turtles&quot; comic led to a widening media presence for the heroes. Eastman and Laird began to widely merchandise their property. Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15 lead figurines for role-playing gamers and collectors, Palladium Books produced a role-playing game featuring the Turtles, and First Comics reprinted in four volumes the first eleven issues as color trade paperback collections.

Palladium&#x27;s role-playing game brought the Turtles to the attention of licensing agent Mark Freedman and the Turtles phenomenon took off, with the various characters soon appearing on T-shirts, Halloween masks, mugs, and other paraphernalia. A five-part televised cartoon mini-series based on the Turtles debuted in December 1987. The half-hour episodes were produced by and the animation was directed by from scripts by David Wise and Patti Howeth. The mini-series was successful, leading to a full series, with the mini-series forming the first season. The series had a 9-year, 10-season, 193-episode run. Bob Burden writes:

In January 1988, Eastman and Laird visited Playmates Toys, who wished to market action figures based on the comic book and animated cartoon series, further cementing the Turtles&#x27; place in history and making Eastman and Laird extremely successful.

===Multimedia===
Multiple other &quot;Turtles&quot; comics, toys, books, games, and other merchandising items have subsequently appeared, overseen and sometimes fully created by Eastman and Laird. Among these are five live-action films: &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1990), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot; (1991), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot; (1993), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2014), and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; (2016). Four more television series were also created: &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot; (1997), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2003), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2012), and &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2018). There also were two animated feature films: &quot;TMNT&quot; (2007) and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot; (2023).

Eastman wrote the 2012 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; episode &quot;Lone Rat and Cubs&quot;. He also co-wrote the 2016 stand-alone TMNT short &quot;Pizza Friday&quot;. Eastman also made a brief cameo in &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;, and made a voice-over cameo in &quot;Mutant Mayhem&quot;.

===Eastman and Laird parting ways===

Creative differences began to strain Eastman and Laird&#x27;s partnership. In an interview in 2002, Laird noted that the two hadn&#x27;t spent much time together since 1993. Eastman moved to California while Laird stayed in Massachusetts.

On June 1, 2000, Laird and the Mirage Group purchased Eastman&#x27;s ownership in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; property and corporations. Eastman wanted to move on to other projects. The buyout was completed on March 1, 2008.

In 2011, Eastman began working with the &quot;TMNT&quot; series again as a writer and artist on the IDW comic series, as well as an adviser on the 2014 reboot of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; film series. Eastman is said to have a cameo in the film as a doctor, and has voiced the character Ice Cream Kitty in the 2012 CGI series.

In December 2019, issue #100 of IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comic series featured a teaser ad for an upcoming comic project titled &quot;The Last Ronin&quot; in which the prospect of a possible reunion and cooperation between Eastman and Laird was held out. The project was confirmed in April 2020, with a TBD release date sometime in the summer, and was subsequently released in October 2020.

==Tundra==
===Foundation===
While co-managing Mirage Studios, Eastman and Laird often spoke of the difficulties in maintaining creative control of their work. Eastman decided to address this problem by using his own personal knowledge and connections to help other creators. Approaching Laird with his ideas, Eastman was met with a less than positive response:

===Intentions and output===
Eastman founded Tundra Publishing in 1990, to realize personal and other projects. He joined with other comic creators like Scott McCloud and Dave Sim to form the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights. Eastman felt obligated to expand it beyond theory and into practice, providing a forum for comics creators to work for a publisher while maintaining ownership of their work.

Rick Veitch has written that:

Moreover, Eastman provided a forum for Marvel and DC creators to work on projects that they could not otherwise realize:

Projects (partly) realized by Tundra included: Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Big Numbers&quot;, Moore and Eddie Campbell&#x27;s &quot;From Hell&quot;, Moore and Melinda Gebbie&#x27;s &quot;Lost Girls&quot; (these last two original serialized in Stephen R. Bissette&#x27;s &quot;Taboo&quot; anthology, which was also part-published by Tundra), &quot;The Crow,&quot; Mike Allred&#x27;s &quot;Madman&quot; and Dave McKean&#x27;s &quot;Cages&quot;, and others.

Eastman initially thought that his experience at Mirage gave him &quot;a pretty good grasp of what a publisher should be, and what a publisher needs to do,&quot; although he swiftly realized that &quot;Tundra was &quot;not&quot; like publishing the Turtles.&quot;

===Difficulties===
As part of Eastman&#x27;s designs for Tundra were to produce personal projects of a more adult nature than the Turtles-oriented Mirage was geared towards, this saw Tundra fitting in the dubious middle-ground, as their intended product sat somewhat awkwardly between the comic shop and the book shop. Eastman says that he &quot;thought that the audience was a lot larger than it actually was,&quot; citing his personal assumption that readers would &quot;grow up through &quot;X-Men&quot; and discover &quot;The Sandman&quot; and then &quot;Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot; and beyond.&quot; The relatively new inroads of comics and graphic novels into bookshops worked against Tundra at the time.

Eastman swiftly became aware that Tundra and the Turtles differed considerably, not least since the latter was successful enough to effectively run itself, with a few &#x27;nudges&#x27; &quot;to keep it moving along.&quot; Tundra, on the other hand, dealt in new properties, which required &quot;building from the ground up,&quot; and was &quot;a lot more work&quot; than Eastman had anticipated, growing far too quickly for comfort, and requiring considerable injections of time and money, rather than being profitable.

Speaking in 1992/93, Eastman was optimistic that the company had &quot;finally reached the point where [it had] slowed up enough... to be giving individual projects the time and attention they require[d].&quot;

=== Merger with Kitchen Sink Press and closure ===
Shortly thereafter, however, Tundra merged with Kitchen Sink Press (KSP), closing its (solo) doors after just three years. Although Eastman ended up on KSP&#x27;s board, Kitchen Sink Press itself closed down in 1999, with Eastman losing between $9 and $14 million once the dust settled.

===Aftermath===
Despite heavy financial losses, Eastman remained philosophical about his work with Tundra. In a 2007 interview, he drew the analogy that:

He made mention of the multiple award nominations Tundra received during its first and second years, including Harvey Awards and Eisner Awards, but noted that despite critical acclaim, the company was not making money on its titles, and had to cease production. He noted that Tundra was one of the earlier creator-owned companies, &quot;before Image really took off&quot; and before Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;Legends line.&quot;

Eastman admitted that Tundra tried to do too much too quickly, and ran into difficulties accordingly. He also suggested that &quot;[n]ot one book made any money&quot;. He also believed that part of Tundra&#x27;s downfall was tied to his offering Marvel and DC employees the chance to work on creator-owned and personal projects. He has stated in an interview that:

==&quot;Heavy Metal&quot;==

Kevin Eastman had been a longtime fan of the science fiction and fantasy magazine, much of whose content was translated from the French, and appeared in the original &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; publication of which &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; is only the American-licensed incarnation. He cites the publication as bringing Richard Corben to his attention as the &quot;second greatest influence&quot; on him as an artist, after Jack Kirby. He saw in its pages European art which had not been previously seen in the United States, as well as an underground comix sensibility that nonetheless &quot;wasn&#x27;t as harsh or extreme as some of the underground comix – but... &quot;definitely&quot; intended for an older readership.&quot;

Discovering &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; had been put up for sale, and with one of Tundra&#x27;s stated aims, to bring a more adult sensibility (and mature, adult &quot;readers&quot;) to comics, overlapping with the magazine&#x27;s target audience, Eastman decided that &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; was &quot;the final piece of the puzzle&quot;, and looked into purchasing it. Noting that:

 Eastman purchased the magazine in January 1992.

Despite the audiences for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and Tundra&#x27;s intended product (as well as more mature-themed comics in general) being of a broadly similar demographic, Eastman recognized from the start that &quot;most of the audience who read &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; buy it off the newsstands; they&#x27;re not going into comic book stores,&quot; and stated early on that his intention was to produce &quot;numerous crossovers from the cutting edge of comics creators&quot; to expose the magazine&#x27;s readership not just to the comics industry, &quot;but anything from the visual media that can cross over.&quot;

Eastman also attempted to bring some European hardcover comics to America, using &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; to help serialize them and both defray the costs and boost readership. Initial interest, however, was &quot;fairly cool.&quot;

Eastman sold the magazine to digital and music veteran David Boxenbaum and film producer Jeff Krelitz in January 2014. Eastman continued to serve as publisher of the magazine until 2020, and was a minority investor in the new &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;.

==Other work==
Aside from his work on multiple &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; projects, and as publisher of Tundra Publishing, Eastman created &quot;Fistful of Blood&quot;, a black and white graphic novel featuring a blend of influences from Spaghetti Western and horror. The book featured art by Simon Bisley and was published by Heavy Metal.

Eastman has acted in a small number of films, including &quot;Guns of El Chupacabra&quot; in 1997 and &quot;The Rock n&#x27; Roll Cops&quot; in 2003. He also had a supporting role in the 2004 Troma film &quot;Tales from the Crapper&quot;. Before that, he had a cameo in the 2000 sequel to &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; called &quot;Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV&quot;. and had a small role in the first TMNT movie as a garbage collector. He also wrote one episode of the animated children&#x27;s series &quot;Corn &amp; Peg&quot;.

He was the subject of an interview in the documentary films &quot;Independents&quot;, and &quot;Turtle Power: The Definitive History of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;.

In the early 2000s Eastman was commissioned to create artwork for the drum kit used by System of a Down drummer John Dolmayan, an avid comic book collector and vendor. Dolmayan commissioned Eastman to illustrate the Ninja Turtles on one drum, while the art for other drums in the kit, which depicted other characters and scenes, were produced by Simon Bisley, Tim Vigil, and Arthur Adams.

==Art collection==
Eastman purchased his first piece of original artwork (&quot;a couple of pages that were penciled by Michael Golden and inked by Bob McLeod for Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;&quot;) at the Atlanta Fantasy Fair, the convention he and Laird attended in 1984. Collecting subsequently became &quot;quite an addiction&quot; for him, and combined with his experiences in getting his, and others&#x27;, comics work recognised as &quot;Art,&quot; led to him founding the Words &amp; Pictures Museum, which operated as a brick-and-mortar museum from 1992 to 1999.

==Personal life==

===Family===

Eastman has a son whom he had via surrogate. He was previously married to model and actress Julie Strain from 1995 to 2006.

Eastman married actress and producer Courtney Carr on October 5, 2013. They lived in San Diego with his son and pet dachshunds.

===Religious beliefs===
Eastman grew up in a church-going Christian family. He considers himself both &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot;, saying that what he most appreciates is Christianity&#x27;s message of universal love, which he believes is shared by many other religions.

<doc id="1203711" wikidata="Q5599903" url="?curid=1203711" title="Great Sacandaga Lake">
<text>The Great Sacandaga Lake (formerly the Sacandaga Reservoir) is a large lake situated in the Adirondack Park in northern New York in the United States. The lake has a surface area of about at capacity, and the length is about . The word &quot;Sacandaga&quot; means &quot;Land of the Waving Grass&quot; in the native Mohawk language. The lake is located in the northern parts of Fulton County and Saratoga County near the southern border of the Adirondack Park. A small portion also extends northward into southern Hamilton County. The broader, south end of the lake is northeast of the City of Johnstown and the City of Gloversville.
Great Sacandaga Lake is a reservoir created by damming the Sacandaga River. The primary purpose for the creation of the reservoir was to control flooding on the Hudson River and the Sacandaga River, floods which had a historically significant impact on the surrounding communities.

==History==

Damming the Sacandaga River had been proposed repeatedly throughout the late 19th century. Only after several large floods impacted downstream communities, such as the city of Albany, was there a serious and concerted effort by the state to explore flood control. A public benefit corporation was established to study the feasibility of the dam and later adopted a resolution proposing the dam in 1924. Construction began in the 1920s and completed in March 1930, at a cost of $12 million. The dam was constructed at Conklingville in the Town of Day, Saratoga County. 4 covered bridges and a steel railroad bridge were removed or destroyed. A new bridge consisting of 21 steel spans was constructed at Batchellerville.
This 1930 bridge was replaced in 2012.

Land speculation flourished as the plan to control the river and flood a large expanse of land leaked out. Many people chose to remove houses and buildings to new sites outside of the flood zone. Many isolated farms were flooded as well as all or part of ten communities (Batchellerville, Fish House, Osborne Bridge, The Vly, Cranberry Creek, Sacandaga Park, Town of Day, Conklingville, Munsonville and Benedict). 1100 people were forced out of their homes and twenty four cemeteries holding 3,872 graves were moved. Anything left behind as the dam neared completion was burned.

The new body of water was initially called a &quot;reservoir,&quot; but in the 1960s it was renamed the Great Sacandaga Lake in an effort to promote tourism to the area. The reservoir is managed by the Hudson River–Black River Regulating District.
Today, the local businesses benefit not only from the flood protection provided by the lake, but also from the tourist attraction and the resulting economy that the lake has created in the area. People not only come from many local cities and towns to visit the lake for recreation, but also from other areas of the state, New England, and New Jersey. Many local and out-of-state residents are not only visitors, but also come to the lake to stay in their summer camps and second homes. Public access to the lake is via the many public boat launches, public beaches, and campgrounds that are located on the shores of the lake.
Although the lake and some lands surrounding it are owned by New York State, no public money is used to manage the reservoir. Approximately 70% of the District&#x27;s revenues come from lease agreements with electrical power companies who run the hydroelectric turbines in the dam.

Located on the south shore is the David Rayfiel House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

The Northern Pike that is recognized as the North American record fish of that species at 46 lbs. 2 oz (20.9 kg), was caught in the reservoir on September 15, 1940 by Peter Dubuc.

==Operation==
Hudson River–Black River Regulating District
*Location: Lat 43°18&#x27;57&quot;, long 73°55&#x27;39&quot; (North American Datum of 1927), Saratoga County, NY, Hydrologic Unit 02020002, 800 ft upstream from right end of Conklingville Dam on Sacandaga River at Conklingville.
*Period of record: January 1930 to current year. Prior to October 1969, published as &quot;Sacandaga Reservoir at Conklingville&quot;.
*Gage: Water-stage recorder. Datum of gage is NGVD of 1929, adjustment of 1912.

==Fishing==
Fish species present in the lake are walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, rock bass, smelt, brown trout, yellow perch, landlocked salmon, pumpkinseed sunfish, and brown bullhead. There are four different access sites, including: a state owned hard surface ramp boat launch on NY-30, in the village of Northville; a state owned hard surface ramp boat launch at the Northampton Beach Campground near NY-30, south of the village of Northville; a state owned hard surface ramp boat launch off County Route 110, northeast of the village of Broadalbin; and a state owned hard surface ramp boat launch on North Shore Road, north of the hamlet of Edinburgh.

<doc id="1203712" wikidata="Q1041907" url="?curid=1203712" title="Wonder Man">
<text>Wonder Man (Simon Williams) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #9 (October 1964). The character, who was initially introduced as a supervillain imbued with &quot;ionic&quot; energy, fought the Avengers, and, after a series of events, was reborn as a superhero, joining the team against which he originally fought.

Williams will make his live-action debut in the upcoming Disney+ original series &quot;Wonder Man&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.

==Publication history==
Wonder Man debuted in the superhero-team title &quot;The Avengers&quot; #9 (cover-dated October 1964), and appeared to die in that issue. Four years later, &quot;The Avengers&quot; #58 (November 1968) revisited the events of #9, explaining that the Avengers had electronically saved Wonder Man&#x27;s mind in a computer. Wonder Man was not seen again until &quot;The Avengers&quot; #102 (August 1972), where he made a cameo appearance in a comatose state. Wonder Man&#x27;s body is revived by the villain Kang in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #131-132 (January – February 1975), and then again by the Black Talon in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #152 (October 1976), and finally by the Living Laser in &quot;The Avengers&quot; Annual #6 (1976). After this last encounter, Wonder Man finally recovers his faculties and joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #160 (June 1977). Wonder Man and his fellow Avenger the Beast were cast as friends and lovers of nightlife, which would become a fan-favorite dynamic of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and continue to be used after the two characters left the series.

Marvel Comics&#x27; then-publisher Stan Lee said in 1978, &quot;You know, years ago we brought out Wonder Man, and [DC Comics] sued us because they had Wonder Woman, and... I said okay, I&#x27;ll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they&#x27;ve got Power Girl [after Marvel had introduced Power Man]. Oh, boy. How unfair.&quot;

Wonder Man later appeared as a founding member of the spin-off &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot; first in a four-issue miniseries (September – December 1984), and continuing as one of the primary characters in the series&#x27; 102-issue run. After that team disbanded, he joined the team Force Works in a series that debuted with a July 1994 cover-date. After that team splintered, Wonder Man rejoined the Avengers in &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3 #4 (May 1998). After the collapse of the team in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #503 (December 2004), Wonder Man joined a new splinter group called the Mighty Avengers, co-starred in that team&#x27;s series, which premiered with March 2007 cover-date.

Wonder Man starred in a self-titled graphic novel in 1986. He then starred in a 29-issue series, &quot;Wonder Man&quot; (September 1991 – February 1994), and then the three-issue miniseries &quot;Avengers Two: Wonder Man and the Beast&quot; (2000). In 2007, he starred in the five-issue miniseries &quot;Wonder Man: My Fair Super Hero&quot;.

Wonder Man appeared sporadically throughout the 2010-2013 &quot;Avengers&quot; series, but played an important role in the &quot;End Times&quot; storyline in issue #31 (December 2012) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).

Comic book writer Rick Remender revealed in an interview that Wonder Man would be a member of the Uncanny Avengers, starting with issue #5.

==Fictional character biography==
Simon Williams is the son of rich industrialist Sanford Williams, owner of Williams Innovations. Simon inherits the munitions factory after his father&#x27;s death, but the company&#x27;s profits fall due to its biggest competitor Tony Stark and his company Stark Industries. On the advice of his brother Eric, Simon tries to embezzle funds from his company but is caught and incarcerated. Simon, desperate and blaming Stark for his predicament, accepts an offer from the master villain Baron Heinrich Zemo. Enchantress pays his bail, so Simon agrees to become a pawn in Zemo&#x27;s plan to infiltrate the Avengers. As a result, Simon is transformed into an ion-powered superhuman. His powers are tested, and he is shown to have great superhuman strength and durability, even defeating the Executioner. Called Wonder Man by Zemo, he is then sent to meet and join the Avengers, with instructions to betray them at a critical moment so that Zemo&#x27;s Masters of Evil can destroy the Avengers. Zemo ensures Wonder Man&#x27;s loyalty by advising him that as a result of the treatment his body now requires periodic doses of a serum to survive—a serum that only Zemo can provide. The Avengers are lured into a trap and captured. The plan fails when Wonder Man decides to save the Avengers and aid them against Zemo, apparently at the cost of his own life. Hank Pym records Wonder Man&#x27;s brain patterns in the hope that one day he can be revived. Unbeknownst to the Avengers, Wonder Man&#x27;s body has simply entered a catatonic state as it adjusts to the effects of the treatment. Eric Williams becomes distraught over the apparent death of his sibling and, blaming the Avengers, assumes the identity of the Grim Reaper in an effort to destroy them. The Grim Reaper steals Simon&#x27;s body at one point, and attacks the Avengers three times before Wonder Man finally returns.

Wonder Man remains in suspended animation for years, and it is during this period that Ultron, the evil robot creation of Hank Pym, steals the brain patterns recorded by the Avengers for use as a template for the synthezoid Vision. It is later revealed that Vision is built from the original Human Torch, an android created by Professor Phineas Horton. This only happened in mainstream continuity and other origins were possible due to the Forever Crystal of Immortus.

During this vulnerable time, Wonder Man is used as a pawn on three occasions. Wonder Man is briefly revived by Kang the Conqueror to battle the Avengers as part of his Legion of the Unliving, and later &quot;resurrected&quot; as a zombie by Black Talon and the Grim Reaper to attack the Avengers once more. On the final occasion, the Living Laser hypnotizes a now-awake but still very weak Wonder Man, in an unsuccessful attack on the Avengers. After this encounter, Wonder Man was restored to true life and chooses to remain with the Avengers, aiding them against Attuma and Doctor Doom. He also fought the Vision, and helped the Avengers battle Graviton. He soon after defeats the Grim Reaper, who was intent on destroying the Vision as he was &quot;artificial&quot; and a &quot;mockery&quot; of his brother; Wonder Man at this point is revealed to have become a being of ionic energy.

Wonder Man eventually joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity and becomes close friends with his teammate, the Beast. For several months after his resurrection, Wonder Man suffers from slight claustrophobia and a fear of dying in battle, as he did once before. Wonder Man finally overcomes his fear of death during the final battle with Korvac. Wonder Man invaded his former plant which had been taken over by the Maggia, and fought Madame Masque and the Dreadnought. Developing an interest in acting, Wonder Man stars in minor roles before moving to Hollywood, where fellow Avenger Hercules uses his contacts to establish Wonder Man&#x27;s career. Wonder Man also works for a time as a stuntman, an ideal vocation since he is invulnerable to virtually all conventional weapons.

Wonder Man helps form the West Coast Avengers, and his new-found confidence begins to become arrogance. He develops a serious rivalry with Iron Man, but sees the error of his ways after a brutal battle with the Abomination. He also foils Doctor Doom&#x27;s plot to control the world. His acting career rises, and he is cast as the villain in the fourth film in the successful Arkon franchise. Wonder Man eventually accepts the Vision as his &quot;brother&quot;, but there is a setback when the Vision is dismantled and rebuilt as an emotionless machine by a global conglomerate. The Scarlet Witch—the Vision&#x27;s wife—asks Wonder Man to provide his brainwaves once again to rebuild the foundational personality matrix of the original Vision, but Wonder Man refuses, having feelings for her himself. The Wasp further deduces that the Vision&#x27;s original relationship to the Scarlet Witch may even have been predicated by Wonder Man&#x27;s initial donation for the original personality matrix; at this, Wonder Man confirms that several of his hesitations about making the attempt arise from these doubts and the subconscious desire he&#x27;s felt toward the Scarlet Witch since her separation from her husband. He is then ensorcelled by the Enchantress, and battles the Avengers.

Wonder Man battles old foes Goliath and the Enchantress, before meeting his would-be sidekick &quot;Spider&quot; and battling Gamma-Burn, resulting in wrecking his jet-pack. Wonder Man then battles the assassin Splice for the first time. Wonder Man takes part in the Kree/Shi&#x27;ar War, and had his powers altered when he and the Vision failed to prevent the Shi&#x27;ar Nega-Bomb from detonating. He battled Angkor, and then journeyed to Hades where he battled Mephisto, Blackheart, the Enchantress, and the Grim Reaper; he then learned that he was immortal. When Avengers West Coast (renamed) disbands after a dispute, Wonder Man becomes a founding member of its successor group Force Works, but is disintegrated in an explosion during their first mission against the alien Kree. Many months later, the Scarlet Witch accidentally resurrects Wonder Man in ionic form; while in this form he appears when she is in need. Several months later, the Scarlet Witch is able to fully revive Wonder Man and he now exists in an independent, more human form. It is also discovered later that the Grim Reaper - dead at the time - is also revived. Wonder Man becomes romantically involved with the Scarlet Witch, but ends their affair during the Kang Dynasty saga, due to her residual feelings for the Vision.

Wonder Man is blackmailed into working for S.H.I.E.L.D. during the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline. Due to charges of misappropriation of funds in his non-profit organization, Wonder Man is pressured to work for the pro-registration side in the ensuing Civil War drama. In addition to capturing renegade vigilantes and criminals, Wonder Man is instrumental in creating televised messages to educate the public and yet-unregistered superhumans about the specifics of the Registration Act. Wonder Man became a member of the Mighty Avengers.

Wonder Man began a romantic relationship with fellow Mighty Avenger Ms. Marvel warning her not to use her position as leader of the Avengers to keep him out of potentially dangerous situations just because of their relationship.

Following the events of the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, Norman Osborn created a new team of Avengers, effectively retiring Wonder Man during the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline. Wonder Man later appears on television, lamenting his tenure as an Avenger, claiming it was all a waste of time, and that using violence to uphold justice has caused nothing but heartache and death. He ends his speech by sadly admitting that having Osborn in charge is exactly what the country deserves. After this, Wonder Man is imprisoned as a member of the new Lethal Legion. This group opposes the tyrannical efforts of Osborn; Wonder Man joins to try to keep them from hurting innocents.

Wonder Man has been seen alongside his old West Coast Avengers teammates Ronin, Mockingbird, Tigra and War Machine in battle with a new version of Ultimo.

During the &quot;Heroic Age&quot; storyline, Simon is approached by Steve Rogers to join the new team of Avengers. Simon refuses stating that the Avengers have caused more problems than they have solved and implies as Rogers leaves that he will make sure his old allies realize the mistake they are making. Simon also mentioned as having been in jail until Steve bailed him out. After learning that Rogers had disregarded his advice, Wonder Man attacks the new team causing some damage to their base before inexplicably disappearing. Thor and Iron Man later contact him to try and reason with him, but Simon refuses to listen to their arguments, stating that the dead heroes that have resulted from the Avengers working together should be a clear sign that the concept is doomed, departing as Thor and Iron Man try to argue that all heroes are aware of the risks when they begin. Significantly, Iron Man notes that Simon is &#x27;leaking&#x27; ionic energy, suggesting that his current mental condition may relate to his powers rather than being simply a matter of choice.

Wonder Man put together the Revengers, a team of super-powered people to stop the Avengers because he believes they do more harm than good, blaming the Avengers for Ultron&#x27;s existence, the damage caused by the Scarlet Witch and the Hulk, the Civil War, and Osborn&#x27;s Dark Avengers. His team subsequently defeats the New Avengers in a quick attack on the mansion before he moves on to attack Avengers Tower, stating that he will destroy the tower unless the Avengers immediately disband. Although Iron Man manages to trap him in a prison specifically designed to contain his ionic energy with the Revengers being quickly defeated by the combined Avengers teams, Wonder Man has still successfully managed to spread doubt among the population about the merits of the Avengers as a concept particularly since Captain Rogers has yet to officially rebuff any of his arguments, asking Beast to remember his words simultaneously reflecting that he may be able to see the Avengers from the outside as he has not been &#x27;real&#x27; since his resurrection before he apparently disappears from his prison.

Wonder Man later reappears to Captain America (Steve Rogers), telling him that he feels sorry for his past actions and that he is trying to redeem himself. Before he can accept help from the Avengers, he is attacked by the Red Hulk. He managed to take him down and looks at Avengers Tower, claiming that he will &quot;earn his way back&quot;. He later plays a pivotal role in rescuing the Wasp from the Microverse. After this, Wonder Man is shown celebrating Jan&#x27;s return alongside the rest of the Avengers at Stark Tower.

At Wasp&#x27;s urging, Simon later joins the Avengers Unity Squad. During conversations with Jan and Sunfire, he makes it clear has no intentions of fighting, and only wants to help use his PR skills to win over skeptical citizens. He and the Scarlet Witch rekindle their relationship. During the final confrontation with the Celestial Executioner, he allows Rogue to absorb him to give her the power to oppose the Celestial, but his essence remains in Rogue after Wanda expels the other absorbed powers from her, leaving Rogue with Simon&#x27;s powers and once again unable to touch others.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Wonder Man&#x27;s consciousness was still in Rogue at the time when the X-Men and the Avengers were inverted by an inversion spell. Rogue used Wonder Man&#x27;s powers when helping the X-Men.

At the time when the Avengers Unity Squad traveled to Counter-Earth to find Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, Rogue was captured by High Evolutionary&#x27;s right-hand man Master Scientist who removed Wonder Man&#x27;s consciousness from Rogue.

After Rogue was unable to see or hear Wonder Man, he was still in Rogue&#x27;s mind. When Rogue kissed Deadpool, Wonder Man was freed from Rogue&#x27;s body as the result of Deadpool&#x27;s healing factor acting like a circuit breaker that enabled Wonder Man to escape from Rogue&#x27;s body.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Wonder Man appears as a member of the Underground which is a resistance movement against Hydra ever since they took over the United States.

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Wonder Man, Quicksilver, and Mockingbird deal with the Kree and the Skrull&#x27;s fight with the Cotati near Navojoa. When Quicksilver is hit by special spheres fired by the Cotati magicians, Mockingbird and Wonder Man come to his aid and help the Kree and the Skrull turn the tide against the Cotati.

==Powers and abilities==
Simon Williams gained his superhuman powers due to chemical and radiation treatments with &quot;ionic&quot; energy by Baron Zemo, giving him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. The process unexpectedly enlaced Pym Particles in the ion ray bombardment. While Zemo&#x27;s initial aim was to use ionic rad supplemented treatments to make Wonder Man at least &quot;the equal of any Avenger,&quot; his treatments surpassed his expectations and endowed Wonder Man with strength comparable to that of Thor. In &quot;Avengers: The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; #3, Captain America described Wonder Man as having &quot;Sentry-level&quot; strength. Zemo&#x27;s treatments also granted Wonder Man virtual invulnerability, immortality, enhanced physicality likened to greater stamina, agility, speed, and instantaneous reflexes. Zemo also outfitted Wonder Man with a rocket pack in his belt to achieve flight.

When the Scarlet Witch resurrected him during Kurt Busiek&#x27;s tenure as head writer, Wonder Man was able to transform into a state of pure ionic energy at will and back again. Following his resurrection and metamorphosis, Wonder Man eventually relearned he is capable of a great many prospects he wasn&#x27;t aware of beforehand. Due to his self-regenerating ionic energy, Simon has the ability to go without air, food, or water. His eyes also glow a bright red and he usually wears sunglasses to conceal the effect but has since realized he can normalize their appearance as well.

Before his &quot;death&quot; at the hands of the Kree, Wonder Man discovered new abilities. In his beginning years, Williams sometimes wore an ionic energy powered apparatus which allowed him simulated flight. Over the course of his career he would gain true flight without need of a thrust system as well as energy projection. Other abilities begotten from manipulating his own ion energies include: emitting force or flame beams from his hands and eyes.; alternating his physical shape in undiscovered ways either changing his size (enabling him to grow taller than his adversary Goliath) and morphing his hand into a sickle or transforming into a more demonic semblance; and withholding the energy in hand to increase the impact force of his physical blows. He could potentially even give superpowers to non-powered individuals by imparting his ionic force onto them and can just as easily reabsorb it back into himself as this somewhat weakens his superhuman abilities.

Since his resurrection, he has rarely used most of these powers but can still shift between human and energy states at will. In later issues his ionic form has begun to &quot;leak&quot; energy, allowing Iron Man to track him by following his unique energy signature, the other heroes speculating that his condition is responsible for his currently unstable attitude and anger at the Avengers. In later appearances he appears to have increased in strength and power, having also learned to teleport at will. He has done so several times in recent appearances; once being when he was detained by the Avengers after staging an attack on the mansion, and again while battling and easily winning against the Red Hulk. Wonder Man has some limited effect on Electromagnetic phenomena as was explained to him by Hank and Nadia Pym, to that end he can absorb various forms of energy be it radiological, ionic, even anti-material in nature.

Simon is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, having received Avengers training in unarmed combat from Captain America. He has an advanced degree in electrical engineering, is an experienced stuntman, and a talented actor. He is also exceptionally wealthy, being the owner of his own private weapons company as well as a successful movie star.

<doc id="1203724" wikidata="Q5053309" url="?curid=1203724" title="Catholic school uniform">
<text>A Catholic school uniform in North America typically consists of a pleated and tartan skirt or jumper dress (a sleeveless dress), Mary Jane or saddle shoes, a button-down shirt, and a sweater for girls, while boys&#x27; uniforms consist of a button-down shirt, a necktie, and dark pants. Actual school uniforms vary widely by location and individual school.

In contrast to most schools in the United States, almost all Catholic schools in that country have some form of dress code, and most of them (especially those with students in the lower grade levels) have a mandatory uniform policy.

In most Commonwealth countries, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand — school uniforms (often akin to the &quot;Catholic school uniform&quot; type in the United States) are common in all types of schools, whether secular or not and regardless of religious denomination.

In most schools in Latin America and the Philippines, school uniforms are common and their design is often very similar to the Catholic school uniform type from the United States.

==Purpose of school uniforms==
The stated purpose of uniforms, often set forth in school uniform policies, include reducing clothing expenditures for parents as well as avoiding distinctions among children based on whose parents can afford to buy them fashionable clothing to wear to school. The school attire is also said to reduce distractions and help with student identification, ensuring that a stranger will stand out among the uniformed students. 
==In North America==
Until the early to mid-1970s, the uniform for girls almost always consisted of a skirt or jumper dress; but it is now common, in the United States, for female pupils to wear uniform shorts or slacks, depending on the weather. This is mainly the result of changing societal norms that, beginning in the late 1960s to early 1970s, resulted in a trend for women and girls in most levels of society to wear trousers and shorts, instead of skirts and dresses, for everyday life. Today, most schools require girls to wear skirts, while others allow girls the choice of skirts, dress or culottes and pants including ankle pants that stop at or just a little above the ankle and twill jogger pants.

A kilted skirt is sometimes worn, especially in schools with predominantly Celtic student populations. In some parts of Canada, the skirt has been modified to include an attached pair of shorts beneath, for modesty called a skort. Bike shorts or leggings are often worn under girls&#x27; skirts or jumper dresses for modesty and to prevent individuals from looking under the girl&#x27;s skirt or dress. The leggings can be ankle-length or capri-length with crew or knee-high socks worn over the ankle leggings. Culottes or ankle pants that stop at or just above the ankle are also sometimes substituted for a skirt, especially at non-parochial private schools; however, for special events, the skirt is usually still worn. Also knee socks or tights are two other commonly worn items with the skirt.

Students in preschool and, less frequently, kindergarten, are held to be more likely to engage in messy activities. As such, they may be asked to wear their school&#x27;s physical education uniform as their regular uniform. Younger girls are often seen wearing jumper dresses in tartan (often called &quot;plaid&quot; in America) over a blouse under their skirts. Many schools require a jumper dress up to the fourth, fifth, or sixth grade, presumably because the lifestyles and habits of younger girls may make blouses more likely to become untucked from skirt or culotte waistbands. They are often worn with tights or knee socks and flats, Sperrys, or sometimes dressy sneakers. After that, the jumper dress is often discarded in favor of a tartan skirt with bike shorts, capri or ankle length leggings, with crew or knee socks over the ankle leggings, tights, knee socks or culottes and blouse or polo depending on the weather and season. Often the skirt and blouse or polo must be worn with a sweater (what &quot;jumper&quot; means in British and other Commonwealth English) or sweater vest, or the polo is worn by itself or with a layering long-sleeved tee underneath or with the polo worn underneath a sweater or sweatshirt with the polo collar turned over the sweater or sweatshirt collar so it&#x27;s visible. Usually flats, or Sperrys, and sometimes other dressy shoes are worn.
Boys typically wear a collared shirt and tie or polo shirt, and slacks of required colors. Twill jogger pants are becoming a comfortable but still appropriate uniform pants choice worn by boys. Polo shirts have to some extent replaced dress shirt. In the winter colder months the polo is seen worn with a layered long-sleeved tee underneath or a sweatshirt or sweater over the polo with the collar of the polo folded over the collar of the sweatshirt or sweater so it&#x27;s visible. Many times in warmer weather dress shorts can be worn usually with crew or knee length socks with ankle socks allowed in some schools. Usually Sperrys or sometimes other dressy shoes or occasionally sneakers are worn.

Both sexes usually wear a sweater or blazer (or both) or polo with a layered long-sleeved tee underneath or a sweatshirt or sweater over the polo with the collar of the polo folded over the collar of the sweatshirt or sweater so the polo collar is visible when required by regulations or weather.

Some schools have unisex uniforms—most often a distinctive shirt, and sometimes pants of a given color. They may also require that a specially-designated, more formal uniform be worn on liturgy days or other special occasions.

Uniforms may vary based on time of year. At many schools, students are excused from having to wear the fairly formal (and warm) uniforms described above during the hotter months of the school year in favor of lighter uniform clothing such as skorts, skirts, or shorts worn with knee socks, crew socks, quarter socks, or triple roll socks, or capri leggings under the skirt. Capri pants are also allowed in some schools. However, at some schools appearance and formality prevail over comfort and students must suffer through the warm weather in their full uniform, which can include long-sleeved dress shirts, ties, wool sweaters, blazers, wool skirts, jumper dresses, leggings, and tights.

In many schools, flats for girls and Sperrys for both girls and boys have become popular and acceptable footwear with the uniforms.

Scrunchies, headbands, or headwrap-style headbands are usually worn in school colors and patterns.

==In popular culture==
The Russian pop duo t.A.T.u. also wore clothing resembling Catholic school uniforms in a video for their song &quot;Ya Soshla S Uma&quot; (also known by the title of its English-language version, &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;).

<text>The history of transport is largely one of technological innovation. Advances in technology have allowed people to travel farther, explore more territory, and expand their influence over increasingly larger areas. Even in ancient times, new tools such as foot coverings, skis, and snowshoes lengthened the distances that could be traveled. As new inventions and discoveries were applied to transport problems, travel time decreased while the ability to move more and larger loads increased. Innovation continues as transport researchers are working to find new ways to reduce costs and increase transport efficiency.

International trade was the driving motivator behind advancements in global transportation in the Pre Modern world. &quot;...there was a single global world economy with a worldwide division of labor and multilateral trade from 1500 onward.&quot; The sale and transportation of textiles, silver and gold, spices, slaves, and luxury goods throughout Afro-Eurasia and later the New World would see an evolution in overland and sea trade routes and travel.

==Land==

=== Road ===

The first earth tracks were created by humans carrying goods and often followed trails. Tracks would be naturally created at points of high traffic density. As animals were domesticated, horses, oxen and donkeys became an element in track-creation. With the growth of trade, tracks were often flattened or widened to accommodate animal traffic (hollow way or drover&#x27;s road). Later, the travois, a frame used to drag loads, was developed. Animal-drawn wheeled vehicles were probably developed in the ancient Near East in the 4th or 5th millennium BC and spread to Europe and India in the 4th millennium BC and China in about 3000 BC. The Romans had a significant need for good roads to extend and maintain their empire and developed Roman roads.

During Industrial Revolution, John Loudon McAdam (1756–1836) designed the first modern highways, using inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (macadam), and the embanked roads a few centimeters higher than the surrounding terrain to cause water to drain away from the surface.

With the development of motor transport, starting in 1886 in Germany and in the U.S. in 1908 with the production of Ford&#x27;s first Model T, there was an increased need for hard-topped roads to reduce washaways, bogging and dust on both urban and rural roads, originally using cobblestones and wooden paving in major western cities and in the early 20th century tar-bound macadam (tarmac) and concrete paving. In 1902, Nottingham&#x27;s Radcliffe Road became the first tarmac road in the world.

=== Rail ===

The history of rail transportation dates back nearly 500 years and includes systems with man or horsepower and rails of wood (or occasionally stone). This was usually for moving coal from the mine down to a river, from where it could continue by boat, with a flanged wheel running on a rail. The use of cast iron plates as rails began in the 1760s, and was followed by systems (plateways) where the flange was part of the rail. However, with the introduction of rolled wrought iron rails, these became obsolete.

The first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway at Oystermouth in 1807, using horse-drawn carriages on existing tramlines. In 1802, Richard Trevithick designed and built the first (unnamed) steam locomotive to run on smooth rails. He was a Cornish engineer and showed off his railway invention in the Welsh mining town of Merthyr Tydfil.

Before actual making the breakthrough for the first railway engine, Trevithick had been facing failures and successes along the route. One of his first successful demonstrations was the &quot;Puffing Devil&quot; steam powered locomotive in 1802 whereas a disaster in Greenwich in 1803 almost sealed the fate of locomotive travel, when four men were killed by an explosion of one of Trevithick&#x27;s engines. This incident was used as a leverage by his rivals to stop the production of the high-pressure steam engines.

However, Trevithick&#x27;s &quot;Penydarren locomotive&quot;, marked its place in history by becoming the first full scale working railway steam locomotive. A bet between Trevithick&#x27;s benefactor Samuel Homfray and Richard Crawshay prompted the key demonstration of the locomotive. Homfray had placed a wager of 500 guineas that the locomotive will transport ten tonnes of iron from the Pendydarren Ironworks to the village of Abercynon which was nearly ten miles away.

Trevithick&#x27;s locomotive completed the journey in just over four hours, ultimately proving the locomotives sturdiness and reliability. However, Trevithick never got the credit he deserved and died a destitute in 1833.

====Modern locomotive====
Modern rail transport systems first appeared in England in the 1820s.

Matthew Murray proved the viability of the steam engine in 1812. Salamanca was the first locomotive to incorporate two cylinders.

George Stephenson who went on to become known as the father of railways is said to have built 16 experimental locomotives for use from the year 1814–1826, the last train which he introduced known as the Killingworth Billy ran until 1881. The first intercity railway between Liverpool and Manchester was built by Stephenson in 1830. These systems, which made use of the steam locomotive, were the first practical form of mechanized land transport, and they remained the primary form of mechanized land transport for the next 100 years. The first railroad built in Great Britain was the Stockton and Darlington, which opened in 1825. It used a steam locomotive built by George Stephenson and was practical only for hauling minerals. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830, was the first modern railroad. It was a public carrier of both passengers and freight. By 1870, Britain had about 13,500 miles (21,700 km) of railroad.

In 1879, electric locomotive development was booming in Germany. In the late 19th century, Werner von Siemens demonstrated the first experimental electric passenger train. The train transported around 90,000 people and worked on the concept of insulated third rail to supply electricity. In 1881, Siemens built the world&#x27;s first electric tram line in the Berlin suburb of Lichterfelde. Following this trend, many such initiatives were set up in Brighton and Vienna in 1883.
Diesel Locomotives

A new type of railway locomotives was developed by Dr. Rudolf Diesel, which involved a new internal combustion method to propel the railway. In 1892, he proposed this method and soon sparked speculation on whether this type of engine would actually work. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Rudolf Diesel worked on putting diesel on track and tried to improve the power-to-weight ratio. He worked at a Swiss engineering firm Sulzer. Eventually, by the end of the Second World War, steam engines became obsolete and were rarely used in developed countries.

At the system&#x27;s greatest extent, in 1914, there were about 20,000 miles (32,000  km) of the track, run by 120 competing companies. The British government combined all these companies into four main groups in 1923 as an economic measure.

British Railways, by name British Rail, the former national railway system of Great Britain, was created by the Transport Act 1947, which inaugurated public ownership of the railways.

The history of rail transport also includes the history of rapid transit and arguably history of monorail.

== Water ==
In the Stone Age, primitive boats developed to permit navigation of rivers and for fishing in rivers and off the coast. It has been argued that boats suitable for a significant sea crossing were necessary for people to reach Australia an estimated 40,000-45,000 years ago. With the development of civilization, vessels evolved for expansion and generally grew in size for trade and war. In the Mediterranean, galleys were developed about 3000 BC. Polynesian double-hulled sailing vessels with advanced rigging were used between 1,300 BC and 900 BC by the Polynesian progeny of the Lapita culture to expand 6,000 km across open ocean from the Bismarck Archipelago east to Micronesia and, eventually Hawaii. Galleys were eventually rendered obsolete by ocean-going sailing ships, such as the Iberian caravel in the 14th century, the Chinese treasure ship in the early 15th century, and the Mediterranean man-of-war in the late 15th century.

In the Industrial Revolution, the first steamboats and later diesel-powered ships were developed. Eventually submarines were developed mainly for military purposes for people&#x27;s general benefit.

Meanwhile, specialized craft were developed for river and canal transport. Canals were developed in Mesopotamia BC. The Indus Valley civilization in Pakistan and North India (from c.2600BC) had the first canal irrigation system in the world. China&#x27;s canal system, whose greatest accomplishment was the Sui dynasty&#x27;s 7th-century Grand Canal between Hangzhou and Beijing, was an essential aspect of its civilization, used for irrigation, flood control, taxation, commercial and military transport, and colonization of new lands from the Zhou dynasty until the end of the imperial era. Canals were developed in the Middle Ages in Europe in Venice and the Netherlands. Ramps for water were made in 1459. Pierre-Paul Riquet began to organise the construction of the 240 km-long Canal du Midi in France in 1665 and it was opened in 1681. In the Industrial Revolution, inland canals were built in England and later the United States before the development of railways. Specialized craft were also developed for fishing and later whaling.

Maritime history also deals with the development of navigation, oceanography, cartography, and hydrography.

=== Trade ===
Often, cities and their surrounding agricultural areas are not self-sufficient for agriculture. Because of this, people living in these regions were forced to trade with other cities, nomads, or pastoralists. People usually traded for raw materials such as tin, bronze, copper, iron ore, or animals. An &quot;intercontinental model&quot; of world trade, &quot;between 1500 and 1800 on the basis of interregional competition in production and trade&quot; was proposed by Frederic Mauro, but the early existence of it was already observed by Dudley North in the year 1691. This world market of trade, as well as the flow of finances throughout, spanned out an interconnected throughout the entire globe, permitted the intersectoral and intersectional regional divisions of both generated competition, and labor.

Through the water frontier, many people throughout history have traveled by water as much as they have by land. Along with this, quite a large number of individuals relied on the sea and maritime trade, raiding, piracy, or smuggling for survival. Littoral peoples, reflecting symbiosis of both land and sea, would often have more in common with one another than they would with their neighboring islands. Throughout centuries in the past, water supplied the cheapest, and sometimes the only means of transporting bulk materials on a large scale, and it was also the most secure way to ensure transport over long distances. Because of this, the proximity of the sea drew Southeast Asians to participate in long-distance trade, but it was not only water that linked the shores to one another - seafaring people, along with traders contributed to these trade routes as well.

==== Ports and inland ====
Maritime traders most often congregated in ports, which were considered the point in which land and sea met that linked the hinterland to the wider world. There were some ports that were more favored than others, blessed with a good location, with sufficient warehouse facilities, accessible harbors, and adequate supplies of food and water became &quot;entrepôts,&quot; which were essentially the super-centers for trade. It was rare that these ports were ever considered a final destination, though, but rather central meeting points in what was an ever-changing economic and political environment. Whether in Asia, Europe, or Africa, these port centers consisted of ethnically and culturally diverse communities. Many officials were of foreign birth or ancestry, skilled in various cultures and languages of foreign merchants, to effectively supervise trade. In many ports, merchants became a powerful group in local politics. Further, these ports promoted cultural exchange, along with economic exchange, due to the fact that it had been open to the world for races, cultures, and ideas to intermix with one another, along with the fact that this blend of both locals and outsiders from diverse backgrounds that were open to accepting cultural differences. Nation-building and modernity reduced the role of trade through the sea and increased the reliance on trade through the land and the air in economic and social exchange. While cities like Singapore, Bangkok, and Hong Kong remain vibrant and open to the world, similar to their early modern roles, only a few ports are as economically crucial today as they were in the past.

Inland trade moved both by water, and overland itself. For example, shipping in small boats went along the coasts of India, but inland waterways were readily available to use to transport goods throughout many parts of India, especially in the south. Caravans that contained numbers from ten, all the way to up forty thousand pack or draft animals moved overland at a time. Combinations of these forms of transportation carried throughout the subcontinent and were therefore transshipped to and from long-distance maritime trade. The majority of all of the port cities were in symbiosis with the caravan routes to and from their related hinterland interiors, and sometimes even with distant transcontinental regions. This is especially true in Central Asia - and it is suggested that the continental trade over both the land and the ocean maritime trade should be viewed not as separate or competitive, but rather as mirror images of one another.

== Air ==

Humanity&#x27;s desire to fly likely dates to the first time man observed birds, an observation illustrated in the legendary stories of Daedalus and Icarus in Greek mythology, and the Vimanas in Indian mythology. Much of the focus of early research was on imitating birds, but through trial and error, balloons, airships, gliders and eventually powered aircraft and other types of flying machines were invented.

Kites were the first form of man-made flying objects, and early records suggest that kites were around before 200 BC in China. Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s dream of flight found expression in several designs, but he did not attempt to demonstrate flight by literally constructing them.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists began analyzing the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and discovered gases such as hydrogen, leading to the invention of hydrogen balloons. Various theories in mechanics by physicists during the same period of time—notably fluid dynamics and Newton&#x27;s laws of motion—led to the foundation of modern aerodynamics. Tethered balloons filled with hot air were used in the first half of the 19th century and saw considerable action in several mid-century wars, most notably the American Civil War, where balloons provided observation during the Siege of Petersburg.
Apart from some scattered reference in ancient and medieval records, resting on slender evidence and in need of interpretation, the earliest clearly verifiable human flight took place in Paris in 1783, when Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d&#x27;Arlandes went in a hot air balloon invented by the Montgolfier brothers. The Wright brothers made the first sustained, controlled and powered heavier-than-air flight on 17 December 1903, in their revolutionary aircraft, the Wright Flyer.

World War II saw a drastic increase in the pace of aircraft development and production. All countries involved in the war stepped up development and production of aircraft and flight-based weapon delivery systems, such as the first long-range bomber.

After the war ended, commercial aviation grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. This growth was accelerated by the glut of heavy and super-heavy bomber airframes like the Lancaster that could be converted into commercial aircraft. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British De Havilland Comet. This marked the beginning of the Jet Age, a period of relatively cheap and fast international travel.

In the beginning of the 21st century, subsonic military aviation focused on eliminating the pilot in favor of remotely operated or completely autonomous vehicles. Several unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs have been developed. In April 2001, the unmanned aircraft Global Hawk flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefueled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft, and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003, the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. Major disruptions to air travel in the 21st century included the closing of U.S. airspace following the September 11 attacks, the closing of northern European airspace after the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Space ==

The realistic dream of spaceflight dated back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, however Tsiolkovsky wrote in Russian, and this was not widely influential outside Russia. Spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s publication in 1919 of his paper &#x27;Robert H. Goddard#A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&#x27;; where his application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid-propellant rockets gave sufficient power that interplanetary travel became possible. This paper was highly influential on Hermann Oberth and Wernher von Braun, later key players in spaceflight.

The first human spaceflight was achieved with the Soviet space program&#x27;s Vostok 1 mission in 1961. The lead architects behind the mission were Sergei Korolev and Kerim Kerimov, with Yuri Gagarin being the first astronaut. On May 5, 1961, the US launched its first suborbital Mercury astronaut, Alan Shepard, in the &quot;Freedom 7&quot; capsule. Kerimov later went on to launch the first space docks (Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188) in 1967 and the first space stations (Salyut and Mir series) from 1971 to 1991. The first spaceflight to the Moon was achieved with NASA&#x27;s Apollo 11 mission in 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin being the first astronauts on the Moon.

== Navigational advances ==
The 13th century saw the rise of the magnetic compass for overseas travel. Prior to its creation, seamen would have to rely on landmarks and stars as guides for navigation. The compass allowed sailors to plot a course, and using magnetic north as a reference, could travel through fog and overcast. This also led to shorter voyages, as they could plot more linear approaches to destinations. Portolan charts rose up, plotting this linear excursion routes, making sea navigation more accurate and efficient. In 1761, marine chronometer was invented.

<text>Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer (1 January 1872 – 14 May 1938) was a Spanish Army officer. He was a leading figure of the 1936 coup d&#x27;état in Zaragoza and sided with the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War.

== Biography ==
Born on 1 January 1872 in Cartagena, he joined the army in 1889. A cavalry officer, as a major he managed the creation of the African Regular troops (Moroccan troops in the Spanish army). In August 1921 he participated in the reconquest of the surroundings of Melilla, occupied by rebel Rifian forces after the Battle of Annual. He was promoted to brigadier general and made envoy to the island of Menorca as military governor. Miguel Primo de Rivera permitted him to go into the reserves in 1926, which led him to participate in a revolt frustrated in 1929. For his support of the republicans, on 17 April 1931 the provisional government of the Republic named him commander-in-chief of Andalusia. Later he was named commander of the troops in Morocco and, after the events of Castilblanco and Arnedo, replaced José Sanjurjo in the main directorate of the Civil Guard.

Cabanellas was a freemason. In 1934 he was a delegate of the Radical Republican Party. In July 1936 he was head of 5ª Organic division based in Zaragoza, where on 19 July he declared his support for the Nationalists. Due to his seniority, he was president of the National Defense Junta that on 21 September 1936 proclaimed Francisco Franco head of government and Generalissimo – though Cabanellas was the only one who dissented to this choice. He warned his fellow rebel generals that &quot;You don’t know what you have done because you don’t know him as do I, given that he was under my command in the African Army… If you give him Spain, he is going to believe that it is his and he will not allow anyone to replace him in the war or after it, until his death.&quot; He was later Chief inspector of the Army until his death.

<doc id="1203751" wikidata="Q749497" url="?curid=1203751" title="Soekarno–Hatta International Airport">
<text>Soekarno–Hatta International Airport (; ), abbreviated SHIA or Soetta, formerly legally called Jakarta Cengkareng Airport (, hence the IATA designator &quot;CGK&quot;), is the primary airport serving the Jakarta metropolitan area on the island of Java in Indonesia. Named after the first president and vice-president of Indonesia, Sukarno (1901–1970) and Mohammad Hatta (1902–1980), the airport is located at Benda, Tangerang and Cengkareng, West Jakarta, which is about 20 km northwest of Central Jakarta.

Soetta was ranked 28th among the world&#x27;s best airport list for 2024 by Skytrax.

For 2023 figures Airports Council International stated Soetta served 49.08 million passengers, ranked the 3rd busiest in Southeast Asia, after Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport and Thailand&#x27;s Suvarnabhumi Airport.

However the local airports authority PT Angkasa Pura (InJourney Airports) gave a larger figure of 54.8 million passengers for 2023, placing Soetta behind Singapore&#x27;s Changi (58.9m) but ahead of Thailand&#x27;s Suvarnabhumi (51.69m)

For 2024, Soetta was the second busiest airports (by passenger seats numbers) in South-East Asia by OAG with 39,327,770 seats, behind Singapore&#x27;s Changi with 41,530,309 seats.

The airport handled 348,088 aircraft movements in 2023.

== History ==
Soetta airport commenced domestic operations on 1 May 1985 replacing the old over-capacity Kemayoran Airport. The airport was expanded in 1991 to replace Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport for international flights, which still serves domestic charter, VIP, private flights, and re-opened as a second commercial airport for domestic flights to relieve pressure over Soekarno-Hatta airport that is currently running overcapacity.

To reduce congestion and to achieve a target to handle 100 flights per hour, a third runway opened in August 2019 and a fourth terminal was planned to be in operation by 2025.

The airport was planned to serve 100 million passengers annually by 2025 after completion of development work. However on November 4, 2024, the construction of the fourth terminal was cancelled by Eric Tohir the then minister of state-owned enterprises, due to lower-than-projected passenger numbers and lower aircraft traffic movement.

Until 1985, Jakarta&#x27;s first airport, Kemayoran Airport, was the main airport for the city and was eventually considered inadequate for further expansion because it was too close to the major Halim Perdanakusuma airport. The civil airspace in the area became increasingly restricted, while air traffic increased rapidly, posing problems for international air traffic. In 1969, a senior communication officers meeting in Bangkok expressed these concerns.

In the early 1970s, with the help of USAID, eight potential locations were analyzed for a new international airport, namely Kemayoran, Malaka, Babakan, Jonggol, Halim, Curug, South Tangerang and North Tangerang. Finally, the North Tangerang site was chosen; it was also noted that Jonggol could be used as an alternative airfield. Meanwhile, as an interim step, the Indonesian government upgraded the Halim Perdanakusuma airfield for use for passenger services. The old Kemayoran site was closed in 1985, and the land was later used for commercial and housing purposes.

Between 1974 and 1975, a Canadian consortium, consisting of Aviation Planning Services Ltd., ACRESS International Ltd., and Searle Wilbee Rowland (SWR), won a bid for the new airport feasibility project. The feasibility study started on 20 February 1974, costing 1 million Canadian dollars. The one-year project proceeded with an Indonesian partner represented by PT Konavi. By the end of March 1975, the study revealed a plan to build three inline runways, three international terminal buildings, three domestic buildings, and one for Hajj flights. Three stores for the domestic terminals would be built between 1975 and 1981 at a cost of US$465 million and one domestic terminals including an apron from 1982 to 1985 for US$126 million. A new terminal project, named the Jakarta International Airport Cengkareng, began.

=== Design ===
The airport&#x27;s terminals 1 and 2 were designed by Paul Andreu, a French architect who also designed Paris–Charles de Gaulle Airport. One of the characteristics of the airport is the incorporation of local architecture into the design and the presence of tropical gardens between the waiting lounges. These unique characteristics earned the airport the 1995 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The runways run northeast-southwest. There are three parallel runways, two on the north side and one on the south side. The airport terminal took the plan of spanning fan, with the main entrances of terminals connected to a series of waiting and boarding pavilions via corridors. These waiting and boarding pavilions are connected to the airplanes through boarding bridges. Terminal 1 is on the southern side of the airport, while Terminals 2 and 3 are on the north side.

The airport concept is described as &quot;garden within the airport&quot; or &quot;airport in the garden&quot;, as tropical decorative and flower plants fill the spaces between corridors, waiting and boarding pavilions. The boarding pavilions demonstrate local Indonesian vernacular architecture, particularly the roof, in the Javanese stepped-roof &quot;pendopo&quot; and &quot;joglo&quot; style. The interior design displays the diversity of Indonesian art and culture, with ethnic decorative elements taken from wooden carvings of Java, Bali, Sumatra, Dayak, Toraja to Papua. Another example is the railings of stairs, doors, and gates, which show the kala-makara (giant head and mythical fish-elephant creature) theme typical in ancient Indonesian temples such as Borobudur. Terminal 3, however, has a different architectural style—unlike the ethnic-inspired Indonesian vernacular architecture of terminals 1 and 2, terminal 3 uses the contemporary modern style of large glass windows with metal frames and columns.

=== Project phases ===
Time was needed to allocate land and also determine the provincial border. Authorities at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol were consulted about the airport plans and concluded that the proposal was rather expensive and over-designed. The cost rose because of using a decentralized system. The centralized system was seen as a more suitable option. The team, however, chose the latter, similar to Orly Airport, Lyon Satolas, Hannover Airport and Kansas City Airport due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

On 12 November 1976, the building project tender was won by the French Aeroport de Paris. 6 months later, the final design was agreed on by the Indonesian government and Aeroport de Paris with a fixed cost of about 22,323,203 French francs and Rp. 177,156,000 equivalent to 2,100,000 francs. The work was scheduled to take 18 months. The government-appointed PT. Konavi is the local partner. The plan included two runways with taxiways, one access road in the east and one in the west (closed to public use) for airport services, three terminals capable of accommodating 3 million passengers per year, and one module for international flights and two for domestic. &quot;An airport inside a garden&quot; was chosen as the design idea.

On 20 May 1980, a four-year contract was signed. Sainraptet Brice, SAE, Colas together with PT. Waskita Karya was chosen to be the developer. Ir. Karno Barkah was appointed the project director, responsible for the airport&#x27;s construction. On 1 December 1980, the Indonesian government signed a contract for Rp. 384.8 billion with developers. The cost structure was: Rp140,450,513,000 from the state budget, 1,223,457 francs donated by France and US$15,898,251 from the United States. The airport structure was completed exactly four years later.

=== Plans ===
The capacity of the airport increased from 22 million in 2014 to 62 million in 2017, but the airport handled more than 63 million passengers in 2017. Therefore, plans to build the fourth passenger terminal is already underway. Angkasa Pura II, as the operator, designed Soekarno–Hatta Airport to have three passenger terminals, one new freight terminal (cargo village) and an &#x27;Integrated Building&#x27;, that will be built in between Terminal 1 and 2. There will be an increase in apron capacity from 125 airplanes to 174 airplanes.

An airport train to Manggarai Station and a people mover for ground transportation to, from and inside the airport were also planned. The free Skytrain began operations in September 2017 while the airport train started commercial service in December 2017.

In the first stage, Terminal 3 will be expanded. Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 will be integrated with green walls and the airport will have a convention hall, shopping center, hotel, playground, recreational facilities and parking area for 20,000 vehicles.

To anticipate a surge in passenger numbers, at least a ten percent increase each year, the government made plans to build a third runway. By May 2019 the construction progress reached 70 percent. 2500 meters of the runway began operational on 15 August 2019. The third runway will be expanded to 3000 metres by the end of 2019. With the opening of the third runway, capacity was increased to 114 flights per hour, up from 81 flights per hour.

Initially, Angkasa Pura II planned for an expansion that will use about from 10 villages in the Teluk Naga and Kosambi subdistricts. The expansion plan was rejected by the Tangerang Municipal Government because the residents living around the airport would lose their jobs. The local government offered another location such as in Balaraja, but Angkasa Pura II corporate secretary said that building a new airport would not be an easy task, as it requires a thorough study. Finally, Angkasa Pura II only used 134 hectares of land and appraisal will be used to buy the land. It can be done due to a new design for the third runway.

To accommodate 86 aircraft movements per hour from the current 72 movements per hour, since 2016 the airport authority has been developing an east cross taxiway costing Rp 1.15 trillion ($86.1 million) to connect the existing Runway 1 and Runway 2. The east cross taxiway was finished and opened in December 2019.

== Terminals ==
There are three main terminal buildings; Terminal 1, Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. The airport also has a dedicated freight terminal for domestic and international cargo.

=== Terminal 1 ===

Terminal 1 is the first terminal built and was opened in 1985. It is located on the southern side of the airport, opposite Terminal 2. Terminal 1 has three sub-terminals, each equipped with 25 check-in counters, 23 aerobridges, five baggage carousels, and seven gates. It can handle 9 million passengers per annum.

The gates in Terminal 1 have a prefix of A, B or C. The gates are A1–A7, B1–B7 and C1–C7. In the latest master plan, Terminal 1 will have its capacity increased to 18 million passengers per annum.

Terminal 1B and Terminal 1C are currently under renovation. The renovation work is targeted for completion in 2021. The revitalization project is expected to double the number of passengers at both terminals to 36 million a year.

=== Terminal 2 ===
Terminal 2 is the second terminal built and was opened in 1991. It is located on the north-western side of the airport, opposite Terminal 1. Like Terminal 1, it has three sub-terminals, labeled as D, E and F, each of which has seven gates, 40 aerobridges and 25 check-in counters. Terminal 2 caters to umrah (minor hajj) flights and was converted into an international low-cost carrier terminal (LCCT) in 2019.

=== Terminal 3 ===

Terminal 3 is the airport&#x27;s newest and largest terminal. It is used as a base for Garuda Indonesia and Citilink and serves as a full-service terminal for both international and domestic flights.

The original Terminal 3 was officially opened for international flights on 15 November 2011, when all Indonesia AirAsia flights started using Terminal 3 as its new base for international, as well as domestic flights. It was built to cater to low-cost carriers. The terminal was located on the north-eastern side of the airport.

On 9 August 2016, a new passenger terminal named &#x27;Terminal 3 Ultimate&#x27;, was officially opened. The original Terminal 3 was revamped and integrated into the new Terminal 3 Ultimate, forming the current Terminal 3. It has a floor area of and was built to handle 25 million passengers per annum. Unlike Terminal 1 and 2, Terminal 3&#x27;s architectural style is vastly different, using an eco-friendly contemporary modern design. It is equipped with 10 international gates, 18 domestic gates, 112 check-in counters, 59 aerobridges and 10 bus gates.

In 2018, the terminal&#x27;s west pier (Pier 1) was extended. 8 new aerobridges were added, with 7 catering to wide-body aircraft and 1 catering to narrow-body aircraft.

Terminal 3 is equipped with BHS level 5 to detect bombs, an Airport Security System (ASS) which can control up to 600 CCTVs to detect faces who are available in the security register, an Intelligence Building Management System (IBMS) which can control uses of water and electricity (eco-green), rainwater system to produce clean water from rain, a recycled water system to produce toilet water from used toilet water, and illumination technology control to illuminate the terminal depending on the weather surrounding the terminal. Terminal 3 will be able to serve 60 airplanes from the current 40 airplanes.

=== Freight terminal ===
The freight terminal is located on the east side of Terminal 1. This terminal was used to handle cargo at the Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, both domestic and international cargo. In the latest master plan, the freight terminal will move to the west side of Terminal 2 and have a larger capacity.

=== Navigation aids ===

Runway 07L/25R and 07R/25L are equipped with Instrument Landing System (ILS). The runways are also equipped with VOR/DME.

=== Cancelled projects ===
==== Terminal 4 ====
In 2019, Angkasa Pura II announced a plan to build Terminal 4, which would have been located on the north side of runway 1, north of Terminal 3, and east of Terminal 1. The terminal was to be built on 130 hectares of land and serve 45 million passengers annually. The terminal was to be designed in the form of an &#x27;H&#x27; and use eco-friendly and modern design, similar to the design of Terminal 3. The terminal was originally expected to be operational by 2024, but construction never commenced.

The project was eventually scrapped by Minister of State Owned Enterprises Erick Thohir in 2024 due to budgetary constraints.

== Airlines and destinations ==

=== Passenger ===


=== Cargo ===
=== Busiest routes ===
Jakarta–Singapore is one of the world&#x27;s busiest international air routes; passenger numbers on this route are growing fast. It was the second busiest international route in Asia after Hong Kong–Taipei in 2015. Singapore Airlines alone operates more than 70 weekly flights between Jakarta and Singapore. The Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta–Surabaya route is ranked ninth busiest in the world by IATA in 2016. Jakarta–Singapore, and Jakarta–Kuala Lumpur routes are ranked in the top ten of world&#x27;s busiest international air routes in 2018.

=== New traffic procedure ===
To ease congestion, the airport authority implemented a new traffic procedure, the 72 Improved Runway Capacity (IRC 72), to handle 72 planes per hour. This limited a plane to 30–45 minutes only for arrival and unloading of passengers, to allow other planes to use the parking space. Gradually it has been implemented and on 26 June 2014, IRC 72 has been implemented fully for the period of 00:00 am to 01:30 am, 02:00 am to 10:00 am and 11:30 pm to 00:00 am with occupancy periods for aircraft are reduced from 110 seconds to 90 seconds of takeoff and from 65 seconds to 50 seconds for landing. The low time is from 04:00 pm to 10:00 pm with only maximum 32 flights/hour. By 2015, IRC 72 will become IRC 86 with the opening of the new terminal. As a comparison, London Heathrow Airport, which has 2 runways like SHIA, can handle 100 flights per hour, so the target for SHIA has been revised to 92 flights per hour by 2015. As of July 2017, maximum flight frequency at Soekarno–Hatta International Airport had been increased to 81 take-offs and landings per hour to accommodate increasing demand from aviation companies.

<doc id="1203753" wikidata="Q1637035" url="?curid=1203753" title="Keratosis pilaris">
<text>Keratosis pilaris (KP; also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially chicken skin.) is a common, autosomal-dominant, genetic condition of the skin&#x27;s hair follicles characterized by the appearance of possibly itchy, small, gooseflesh-like bumps, with varying degrees of reddening or inflammation. It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.
The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes.
The cause of KP is not completely understood. As of 2018, KP is thought to be due to abnormalities in the process of depositing the protein keratin in hair follicles, abnormalities in the hair shaft, or both. KP is usually diagnosed by a medical professional based on the appearance of the skin, but dermoscopy can be used, as well, if the diagnosis is unclear. Variants of the &quot;ABCA12&quot; gene have been associated with KP.
KP is the most common disorder of the hair follicle in children. 
How common it is in adults is unclear since keratosis pilaris is an underreported condition and the actual prevalence of the condition may be higher than estimated. No single approach has been found to completely cure KP, but treatments can improve the cosmetic appearance of the condition. Treatment includes the application of topical preparations of moisturizers and medications such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, or retinoids to the skin. Fractional carbon dioxide lasers and therapies are also effective.

==Signs and symptoms==
KP results in small, rough bumps on the surface of the skin. They are skin-colored bumps the size of a grain of sand, many of which are surrounded by a slight pink color in light-skinned people and dark spots in dark-skinned people. Most people with KP do not have symptoms, but the bumps in the skin can occasionally be itchy. Irritation due to scratching KP bumps can result in redness and inflammation.

Though people with KP experience the condition year-round, the problem can become exacerbated, with the bumps likely to look and feel more pronounced in color and texture, during the colder months, when moisture levels in the air are lower. The symptoms may also worsen during pregnancy or after childbirth. Increased sun exposure might mitigate the symptoms of KP. 

==Pathophysiology==
KP occurs when the human body produces excess amounts of the skin protein keratin, resulting in the formation of small, raised bumps in the skin, often with surrounding redness. The excess keratin, which is the same color as the person&#x27;s natural skin tone, surrounds and entraps the hair follicles in the pore. This causes the formation of hard plugs (a process known as hyperkeratinization). Many KP bumps contain an ingrown hair that has coiled. This is a result of the keratinized skin&#x27;s &quot;capping off&quot; the hair follicle, preventing the hair from exiting. The hair grows encapsulated inside the follicle. KP is more common in patients affected by atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.

KP subtypes are occasionally part of genetically inherited syndromes associated with intellectual disability, neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes, RASopathies, ectodermal dysplasias, and certain myopathies.

==Diagnosis==
Physicians can often diagnose KP simply by examining the skin without specialized tests, but a dermatologist can use dermoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and assess if a person with KP is responding to treatment. Physicians often consider family history and the presence of symptoms when making the diagnosis. Those with this condition are generally encouraged to contact a physician if the bumps are bothersome and do not improve with over-the-counter lotions.

===Differential diagnosis===
Several medications that can cause a skin eruption similar to KP include cyclosporine, BRAF inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
===Classification===
The several different types of KP include KP rubra (red, inflamed bumps, which can be on arms, head, legs), KP alba (rough, bumpy skin with no irritation), KP rubra faceii (reddish rash on the cheeks), KP atrophicans, keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, atrophoderma vermiculatum, KP atrophicans faciei, erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli, and papular profuse precocious KP.

KP is commonly described in association with other dry-skin conditions, such as ichthyosis vulgaris, dry skin, and atopic dermatitis, including those of asthma and allergies. KP does not bear any known, long-term health implications, nor is it associated with increased mortality or morbidity. It is not related to goose bumps, which result from muscle contractions, except that both occur in the area where the hair shaft exits the skin.

==Treatment==
KP is medically harmless, but many individuals may seek treatment, as the condition can cause emotional distress. Topical creams and lotions are currently the most commonly used treatment for KP, specifically those consisting of moisturizing or keratolytic treatments, including urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, vitamin D, fish oil, or topical retinoids such as tretinoin. Improvement of the skin often takes months, and the bumps are likely to return. Limiting time in the shower and using gentle exfoliation to unclog pores can help. Many products are available that apply abrasive materials, with alpha or beta hydroxy acids to assist with exfoliation.

Some cases of KP have been successfully treated with laser therapy, which involves passing intense bursts of light into targeted areas of the skin. Depending on the body&#x27;s response to the treatment, multiple sessions over the course of a few months may be necessary.

==Epidemiology==
Worldwide, KP affects an estimated 30 to 50% of the adult population, and around 50 to 80% of all adolescents. It is more common in women than in men, and it is often present in otherwise healthy individuals. The skin condition is prevalent in people of all ethnicities, and no particular ethnicity is at higher risk for developing KP. Although KP may manifest in people of any age, it usually appears within the first decade of life and is more common in young children. In most cases, the condition gradually improves before age 30, but it can persist longer.

<doc id="1203761" wikidata="Q852014" url="?curid=1203761" title="Madman Across the Water">
<text>Madman Across the Water is the fourth studio album by English musician Elton John, released on 5 November 1971 by DJM and Uni Records. The album was his third album to be released in 1971, at which point John had been rising to prominence as a popular music artist. John&#x27;s first progressive rock album, &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; contains nine tracks, each composed and performed by John and with lyrics written by songwriting partner Bernie Taupin. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman plays Hammond organ on two songs.

There were two singles released from &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;, &quot;Levon&quot; and &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;. The album was certified gold in February 1972, followed by platinum in March 1993, and 2× platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA. The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. On 10 June 2022, the album was reissued as a deluxe edition for its 50th anniversary, featuring 18 unreleased tracks including demos, outtakes and alternate takes, as well as a 40-page book detailing the album&#x27;s creation with notes from John and Taupin.

==History==
The nine tracks were each composed and performed by John and with lyrics written by songwriting partner Bernie Taupin as with his previous material. Like John&#x27;s other studio albums up to this point, &quot;Madman&quot; featured John&#x27;s touring band (which consisted of bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson) on only a single song, due to producer Gus Dudgeon&#x27;s lack of faith in the group for studio recordings. Instead, most of the tracks were backed by studio players and string arrangements put together by Paul Buckmaster. Davey Johnstone, who had previously worked with Dudgeon as a part of Magna Carta, was also put on as the main guitarist.

Johnstone, Murray and Olsson would be fully featured on John&#x27;s next album, &quot;Honky Château&quot;. Percussionist and later band member Ray Cooper made his first appearance with this album, which was John&#x27;s last to be recorded at London&#x27;s Trident Studios, although subsequent albums would be remixed or overdubbed there. Caleb Quaye and Roger Pope would not play with John again until &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; in 1975, following Murray and Olsson&#x27;s departure from the band.

===Title===
The album&#x27;s title song was initially set to be released on John&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, featuring guitarist Mick Ronson; however, that version was set aside and the song was re-recorded for this album, with Johnstone on guitar. The earlier version was included on the remastered &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; compact disc.

Dispelling rumours that the song&#x27;s lyric referred to then US President Richard Nixon, Bernie Taupin had this to say:
==Reception==
&quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; was one of John&#x27;s lowest-charting album efforts. It continued a streak of mediocre performance in the UK for John, peaking at No. 41 on the UK Albums Chart and spending two weeks there. The album fared much better in North America, peaking at No. 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums and later on at No. 10 on the year-end list of 1972.

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in February 1972, achieving $1 million in sales at wholesale value just in the United States. In 1993, the album was certified Platinum, representing shipments of more than one million units in the US. In 1998, the album was certified Multi-Platinum, representing shipments of over two million units in the US. In May 2017 the album was certified Silver for sales of 60,000 units by the British Phonographic Industry.

On release, Alex Dubro of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was not especially enthusiastic about the album and found it inferior to its two predecessors. Although he commended &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; and &quot;Levon&quot;, he found the lyrics throughout the record confusing, concluding that it is a &quot;difficult, sometimes impossibly dense record&quot; that would not upset John&#x27;s current fans, but not gain new ones either. Penny Valentine in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine was more positive, however, describing John as &quot;a music man of immense feeling and power&quot; and full of unexplored talent.

When it was released in &quot;The Classic Years&quot; collection, it was the first album not to feature any bonus tracks. One known track recorded at the time, &quot;Rock Me When He&#x27;s Gone&quot;, was released on the 1992 compilation &quot;Rare Masters&quot;. The song was written for and recorded by one of John&#x27;s long-time friends, Long John Baldry. It was later remastered for the 50th anniversary deluxe edition.

&quot;Madman&quot; was John&#x27;s first foray into progressive rock, and it did not sell well. His next album, &quot;Honky Château&quot;, shifted gears to glam rock, beginning a string of more successful releases. He did not touch upon prog rock again until &quot;Blue Moves&quot; in 1976, another less popular album. &quot;Madman&quot; was helped in North America by FM radio deejays willing to play the lengthy singles, unlike BBC Radio 1.

== Covers ==
Alice in Chains member Jerry Cantrell covered the album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, for his third solo album, &quot;Brighten&quot;. He told Wall of Sound that John gave him his approval for his rendition, revealing he said, &quot;Absolutely you should put it on the record. You got my permission. You did a great version.&quot;

Note
*The SACD version of the album contained a longer version of &quot;Razor Face&quot;, which extended the song-ending jam to 6:42 instead of the early fade on the original album. This extended version can only be heard in the 5.1 surround mix, or on the 50th Anniversary reissue of the album.

===50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition===
Note
*The live radio broadcast of &quot;Indian Sunset&quot; is from November 17, 1970 and edits out the last verse of the song. The full version of the song (without John&#x27;s intro) is on the expanded edition of &quot;11-17-70&quot;+.

<doc id="1203776" wikidata="Q77283" url="?curid=1203776" title="Friedrich Spee">
<text>Friedrich Spee (also &quot;Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld&quot;; February 25, 1591 – August 7, 1635) was a German Jesuit priest, professor, and poet, most well known as a forceful opponent of witch trials and one who was an insider writing from the epicenter of the European witch-phobia. Spee argued strongly against the use of torture, and as an eyewitness he gathered a book full of details regarding its cruelty and unreliability. He wrote, &quot;Torture has the power to create witches where none exist.&quot;

==Life==

Spee was born at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. On finishing his early education at Cologne, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1610, and pursued extensive studies and activity as a teacher at Trier, Fulda, Würzburg, Speyer, Worms and Mainz, where he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1622. He became professor at the University of Paderborn in 1624. From 1626 he taught at Speyer, Wesel, Trier and Cologne, and preached at Paderborn, Cologne and Hildesheim.

An attempt to assassinate Spee was made at Peine in 1629. He resumed his activity as professor and priest at Paderborn and later at Cologne, and in 1633 removed to Trier. During the storming of the city by the imperial forces in March 1635 (in the Thirty Years&#x27; War), he distinguished himself in the care of the suffering, and died soon afterwards of a plague infection contracted while ministering to wounded soldiers in a hospital.
His name is often incorrectly cited as &quot;Friedrich von Spee&quot;.

==Publications==

Spee&#x27;s literary activity was largely confined to the last years of his life, the details of which are relatively obscure. Two of his works were not published until after his death: &quot;Goldenes Tugendbuch&quot; (Golden Book of Virtues), a book of devotion highly prized by Leibniz, and &quot;Trutznachtigall&quot; (Rivaling the Nightingale), a collection of fifty to sixty sacred songs, which take a prominent place among religious lyrics of the 17th century and have been repeatedly printed and updated through the present.

===&quot;Cautio Criminalis&quot;===
His principal work &quot;Cautio Criminalis&quot; is a passionate plea on behalf of those accused of witchcraft. The book was first printed anonymously in 1631 at Rinteln and attributed to an &quot;unknown Roman theologian [&quot;Incerto Theologo Romano&quot;].&quot; It is based on his own experiences in the time and place (along the Rhine) that experienced some of the most intense and fatal witch-hunts, notably the Würzburg witch trials, during which Spee was present. Spee was present as a Jesuit confessor during sessions of torture and executions. &quot;If the reader will allow me to say something here, I confess that I myself have accompanied several women to their deaths in various places over the years and I am now so certain of their innocence that I feel there&#x27;s no effort that would not be worth my undertaking to try to reveal this truth.&quot;

Spee was reportedly brought to this awareness by the Duke of Brunswick, who invited Spee and another famous Jesuit scholar to supervise a continuation of the torture of a confessed witch. The Jesuits had previously carefully studied the issues and &#x27;told the Duke, &quot;The Inquisitors are doing their duty. They are arresting only people who have been implicated by the confession of other witches.&quot;&#x27; The Duke then led the Jesuits to a woman being stretched on the rack and asked her, &quot;You are a confessed witch. I suspect these two men of being warlocks. What do you say? Another turn of the rack, executioners.&quot; &quot;No, no!&quot; screamed the woman. &quot;You are quite right. I have often seen .. . They can turn themselves into goats, wolves, and other animals. ... Several witches have had children by them. ... The children had heads like toads and legs like spiders.&quot; The Duke then asked the Jesuits. &quot;Shall I put you to the torture until you confess, my friends?&quot; Spee thanked God he had been led to this insight by a friend, not an enemy. 

Spee wrote in direct opposition to many of the most well-known witch-mongers of his time and, like those works and most others in the demonological lineage going back to the 15th century, Spee also wrote in Latin. &quot;I pronounce from my soul that for a long time I have not known what trust I can place in those authors, Remy, Binsfeld, Delrio, and others... since virtually every one of their teachings concerning witches is based on no other foundations than fables or confessions extracted through torture.&quot;

Spee pleaded for measures of reform, such as a new German imperial law on the subject, and liability to damages on the part of the judges. &quot;Cautio Criminalis&quot; contains 51 &quot;doubts&quot; [&quot;dubiorum&quot;] which Spee discussed and carefully de-constructed. Amongst his more notable conclusions were:

* (Dubium 17) That the accused should be provided a lawyer and a legal defense, the enormity of the crime making this all the more important.
* (Dubium 20) That most prisoners will confess to anything under torture in order to stop the pain.
* (Dubium 25) Condemning the accused for &quot;not&quot; confessing under torture (i.e. having employed the so-called &quot;sorcery of silence&quot;) is absurd.
* (Dubium 27) That torture does not produce truth, since those who wish to stop their own suffering can stop it with lies.
* (Dubium 31) Documents the barbarous cruelty, and sexual assaults on women, brought on by the practice of strip- searching and fully shaving [&quot;tonderi&quot;] every part of prisoner&#x27;s body prior to the first session of torture.
* (Dubium 44) That accusations against alleged accomplices stemming from torture were of little value: either the tortured person was innocent, in which case she had no accomplices, or she was really in league with the Devil, in which case her denunciations could not be trusted either.

Spee was particularly concerned about cases where a person was tortured and forced to denounce (accuse) accomplices, who were then tortured and forced to denounce more accomplices, until everyone was under suspicion:

:&quot;Many people who incite the Inquisition so vehemently against sorcerers in their towns and villages are not at all aware and do not notice or foresee that once they have begun to clamor for torture, every person tortured must denounce several more. The trials will continue, so eventually the denunciations will inevitably reach them and their families, since, as I warned above, no end will be found until everyone has been burned.&quot; (Dubium 15)

====Legacy====
&quot;Cautio Criminalis&quot; helped bring an end to witch-hunting. The moral impact created by the publication was considerable. Already within the 17th century, a number of new editions and translations had appeared. Among the members of Spee&#x27;s Jesuit order, his treatise found a favorable reception.

Philipp van Limborch was a Dutch Protestant but his influential &quot;History of the Inquisition&quot; (1692) refers favorably to the work of the Jesuit Spee. Limborch was close with the Englishman John Locke as the two pushed for religious toleration.

===Hymns===

Spee wrote the lyrics and tunes of dozens of hymns, and is still the most heavily attributed author in German Catholic hymnals today. Although an anonymous hymnist during his lifetime, today he is credited with several popular works including the Advent song &quot;O Heiland, reiß die Himmel auf&quot;, the Christmas carols &quot;Vom Himmel hoch, o Engel, kommt&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and the Easter hymn &quot;Lasst uns erfreuen&quot; widely used with the 20th-century English texts &quot;Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones&quot; and &quot;All Creatures of Our God and King&quot;.

<text>Titanic is a 1953 American drama film directed by Jean Negulesco, and starring Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck. It centers on an estranged couple and other fictional passengers on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the ship of the same name, which took place on April 14, 1912.

The film was the first &quot;Titanic&quot; one for 20th Century Fox, which also released the 1997 film of the same title internationally, while Paramount Pictures handled the North American distribution. It met critical praise.

==Plot==
At the last minute, Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb), a wealthy expatriate in Europe, offers a Basque emigrant money for his third class (the lowest class) ticket for the maiden voyage of the &quot;Titanic&quot;—and succeeds. Once aboard, he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and 13-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac Island, Michigan, to rear them as down-to-Earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself.

As the ship is prepared for departure, Sanderson (Anthony Eustrel), the company representative (based on Bruce Ismay) suggests to Captain Edward J. Smith (Brian Aherne) that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed.
Other passengers include Maude Young (based on real-life &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor Margaret Brown), a wealthy woman of a working class origin (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player named Gifford &quot;Giff&quot; Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism.

One night on the bridge, Captain Smith asks Second Officer Charles Lightoller (Edmund Purdom) about a note by Murdoch regarding binoculars; Lightoller explains that the ship is shy on them: they have just enough for the bridge, but none for the lookout.

When Annette learns Julia&#x27;s intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with Richard on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that Annette is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing her to reveal that Norman is not his son, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, Richard declares to make no claim to Norman and does not want to see him again.

Richard joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play auction bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds him of a shuffleboard game they had arranged, he coldly brushes him off.

Meanwhile, Giff falls for Annette at first glance. At first, she repulses his brash attempts to become better acquainted, but eventually warms to him. That night, Giff, Annette, and a group of young people sing and play the piano in the dining room, while Captain Smith watches from a corner table.

Lightoller expresses his concern to Captain Smith about the ship&#x27;s speed when they receive two messages from other ships warning of iceberg sightings near their route. However, Smith assures him that the sea is clear and the track is south of the reported icefield.

That night, the lookout spots an iceberg dead ahead. The crew tries to steer clear of it, but it gashes the starboard side of the bow below the waterline and the ship begins taking on water. When Richard finds Captain Smith, he insists on being told the truth: the ship is doomed and there are not enough lifeboats to save everyone on board. He tells his family to dress warmly but properly; then they head outside.
Richard and Julia have a tearful reconciliation on the boat deck, as he places her, Annette, and Norman into a lifeboat. Unnoticed by Julia, Norman gives up his seat to an older woman and goes looking for Richard. When one of the lines becomes tangled, preventing the boat from being lowered, Giff climbs down and fixes it, only to lose his grip and fall into the water. Unconscious but alive, he is dragged onto the boat.

Meeker disguises himself as a woman to board a lifeboat, but Maude notices his shoes and unmasks him in front of the others. At the other end of the spectrum of courage and unselfishness, George Healey heads down into one of the boiler rooms to comfort injured crewmen.

As the &quot;Titanic&quot; is in her final moments, Norman finds Richard. Richard tells a passing steward that Norman is his &quot;son&quot; and then tells Norman that he has been proud of him every day of his life. Then they join the rest of the doomed passengers and crew in singing the hymn &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;. As the last boiler explodes, the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s bow plunges, pivoting her stern high into the air while she rapidly slides into the icy water. As dawn approaches, the survivors are seen in the lifeboats, waiting for help to arrive.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Walter Reisch says Darryl F. Zanuck called him and Charles Brackett in and told them, &quot;I have Clifton Webb under contract, and we have CinemaScope, and I now want to do something big...Don&#x27;t make Clifton a clown. I want him to start a new career as a character actor. Use all the young people we have on the lot, like Audrey Dalton and Robert Wagner...&quot;

Reisch says he came up with the &quot;Titanic&quot; idea and pitched Clifton Webb as one of the 25 multi-millionaires who died on it. He said the film would be &quot;60 percent truth, completely documentary&quot; drawing on real-life accounts. A part was written for Thelma Ritter. Reisch says it was Richard Breen&#x27;s idea to have an alcoholic priest.

Brackett, who cowrote and produced the film, told the press that some of the stories had to be discarded &quot;because they are too fantastic for movie audiences to believe&quot;. At one point the film was going to be called &quot;Nearer My God to Thee&quot;.

Filming began in late October 1952 and wrapped in early December 1952.

The film used a twenty-eight foot model of the &quot;Titanic&quot; for filming; the model is currently on display at the Maritime Museum at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts.

===Casting===
In a September 1952 news article, it was reported that Terry Moore was set to play the role of Annette Sturges, on condition that she would finish production of &quot;Man on a Tightrope&quot; on time.

==Critical reception==
According to the film aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 92% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating, based on 10 reviews.

&quot;Variety&quot; reviewed the film positively stating, &quot;but by the time the initial 45 or 50 minutes are out of the way, the impending disaster begins to take a firm grip on the imagination and builds a compelling expectancy&quot;.

Pauline Kael was not impressed with the picture&#x27;s special effects. She wrote: &quot;the actual sinking looks like a nautical tragedy on the pond in Central Park&quot;.

It is generally considered by historians that &quot;Titanic&quot; contains abundant historical inaccuracies. For example, the maiden voyage was not sold out, but actually barely more than half-booked, as shown by White Star Line records of 1912. Linda Koldau writes: &quot;[...] the &quot;Titanic&quot; was far from being sold out and an additional passenger would easily have been able to purchase a first-class ticket...Yet if one accepts that historical accuracy is not the point here, since the story is not at all that of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, it is a perfectly functioning script&quot;.

Also, the &quot;Carpathia&quot; had arrived at the scene at around 4:10am and started picking up the survivors before sunrise. The rescue took several hours. In addition, Captain Smith was not awake at the time of the collision with the iceberg, as shown in the film, but was awakened immediately thereafter and summoned to the bridge. The film shows, erroneously, that the iceberg penetrates the ship&#x27;s port side.

The wireless from the &quot;Caronia&quot; warning the &quot;Titanic&quot; of an iceberg ahead on the steamer track was never shown by the wireless operator Jack Phillips to Captain Smith or other officers, but in the film Phillips does show it to Captain Smith and First Officer Charles Lightoller, who then wonders in the film whether that is the same iceberg north of the steamer track previously warned of in a wireless from the &quot;Baltic&quot;, which Phillips had shown to his superior officers.

During the evacuation, the ship consistently blows her steam whistle and sounds a fire alarm. She did not blow her whistle at all during the sinking and never had any fire alarms either.

The film makers decided to have the &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s band playing &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; and eventually &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; (with the remaining passengers joining in), and not to mention the &quot;Californian&quot; that was in the vicinity of the real &quot;Titanic&quot; that fateful night.

&quot;Titanic&quot; historians Fitch, Layton, and Wormstedt judge that the film has some impressive special effects and, in some ways, recreates the feeling of being on board the ship. However, the film is not very accurate, although the advertising claimed the opposite. Most of the events shown are dramatically exaggerated or simply wrong.

==Awards and nominations==
The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Art Direction. Negulesco&#x27;s direction would go on to be nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award, and Stanwyck was nominated for a Golden Laurel Award for Top Female Dramatic Performance.

<text>The Seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia is the official seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia, a U.S. state. The state flag of Virginia consists of the obverse of the seal against a blue background. A state flag was first adopted at the beginning of the American Civil War in April 1861, readopted in 1912, and standardized by the General Assembly in February 1950. The standing allegorical female figure of &quot;virtue&quot; is shown having vanquished &quot;tyranny&quot;, symbolized by a fallen king at her feet. She has an exposed breast in the manner of classical depictions of Amazons. The motto &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; means &quot;Thus always to tyrants.&quot; 

It is one of six US state flags (along with Florida, New York, New Jersey, Wyoming, and Idaho) with a depiction of a woman, and the only state flag in the U.S. depicting toplessness. 

The flag may be decorated with a white fringe along the fly edge; this is usually done when the flag is displayed indoors.

==History==


In May 1776 the Virginian colony declared its independence from Great Britain. On July 1, 1776, a committee of four was appointed to make a proper seal for the Commonwealth of Virginia. The four men were Richard Henry Lee, George Mason, George Wythe, and Robert Carter Nicholas Sr. Four days later the committee&#x27;s report for a design of the seal was read, and Mason presented it to the Virginia government. It was voted on and approved that same day. It is not known for certain which members of the committee were chiefly responsible for the design of the seal, but it is generally believed to be principally the work of Wythe.

The seal makers did not want a design which in any way resembled the style of coats of arms used in Great Britain. Because of the admiration for the Roman Republic felt by the Virginian leaders, the design of the new seal was taken from the mythology of Ancient Rome. They also chose a two-sided design, as shown above.

By 1912, many variants of the seal had become propagated, leading to confusion as to which was the actual seal. Thus, Virginia decided to standardize the design of the seal to avoid confusion.

==Design==

===Obverse===

The obverse of the seal is the official seal of Virginia and is used on all the official papers and documents of the Commonwealth&#x27;s government, as well as on its flag. On this side, a female figure personifying the Roman virtue of was selected to represent the genius of the new Commonwealth. Virginia&#x27;s Virtus is a figure of peace, standing in a pose which indicates a battle already won. She rests on her long spear, its point turned downward to the ground. Her other weapon, a parazonium, is sheathed; it is the sword of authority rather than that of combat. Virtus is typically shown with a bare left breast; this is commonly recognized as the only use of nudity among the seals of the U.S. states.

Tyranny lies supine beneath the foot of Virtus, symbolizing Great Britain&#x27;s defeat by Virginia. The royal crown which has fallen to the ground beside him symbolizes the new republic&#x27;s release from the monarchical control of Great Britain; Maryland, Virginia and New York are the only U.S. states with a flag or seal displaying a crown. The broken chain in Tyranny&#x27;s left hand represents Virginia&#x27;s freedom from Britain&#x27;s restriction of colonial trade and westward expansion. The useless whip in his right hand signifies Virginia&#x27;s relief from the torturing whip of acts of punishment such as the Intolerable Acts. His robe is purple, a reference to Julius Caesar and the Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus.

The motto selected for the obverse of the Virginia seal is &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot;, or in English, &quot;Thus always to tyrants&quot;. This is a derived quote from the famous events in Roman history, attributed to Brutus upon his participation in the slaying of Caesar. (Caesar had been named perpetual dictator of Rome in the same year, and some senators believed he had ambitions to abolish the Roman Republic and establish himself as a monarch.)

A joke referencing the image on the seal that dates as far back as the Civil War, is that &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; actually means &quot;Get your foot off my neck.&quot;

In 2010, Ken Cuccinelli, attorney general of Virginia, gave his staff lapel pins with Virtus&#x27;s bosom covered by an armored breastplate. His spokesman, Brian Gottstein, said the pin was paid for by Cuccinelli&#x27;s political action committee, not with taxpayer funds.

===Reverse===
The reverse of the seal pictures the blessings of freedom and peace, as represented by three Roman goddesses. In the center is the matron Libertas, the goddess of individual liberties. In her hand she holds a wand showing her magical gifts, and at the top of the wand hangs a Phrygian cap, also called a liberty cap — later made popular by French revolutionaries.

To the left of Libertas stands Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture. In her left hand is a horn of plenty overflowing with the abundance of Virginia&#x27;s harvests, while in her right hand is an enormous stalk of wheat, representing one of Virginia&#x27;s leading crops. Aeternitas, representing Virginia&#x27;s eternity, stands at the right of Libertas. In her right hand is a golden ball, an emblem of authority, and atop the ball is a phoenix, symbolizing immortality. On the Virginia seal, the phoenix represents effective government.

The motto gracing the reverse with its trio of Libertas, Ceres, and Aeternitas is &quot;Perseverando&quot;, or in English, &quot;Persevering&quot;, a reminder to future generations of the need to persist in maintaining the blessings of liberty. The ornamental border on both sides of the seal consists of sprigs of &quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot;, or commonly, Virginia creeper. In 1930 another committee was charged with standardizing the seal&#x27;s design because of all the variations that came into use over the years. The seals that now adorn the doors of the Southern Portico of the Capitol in Richmond were designed by Charles Keck. What the committee approved was basically adopting the 1776 seal as the standard. In 1949, another standard was implemented, when Virginia&#x27;s Art Commission defined the official color scheme for the seal.
The Great Seal and the lesser seal are the same except for size. The lesser seal is used on commissions of commonwealth officials and notaries, and on other papers which remain within the boundaries of, or relate only to, Virginia.

==Legal description of seal==

The Seal of Virginia is officially described in the Code of Virginia (1950), §1-500, as follows:

Under Virginian state law, the secretary of the Commonwealth is the Keeper of the Seals of the Commonwealth.

== Coat of arms ==

At the University of Virginia on 10 July 1976, as part of her visit to celebrate the bi-centenary of the United States of America, Queen Elizabeth II presented the Governor of Virginia the Letters Patent of Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms dated 3 June 1976 which devised arms, crest and supporters for the Commonwealth of Virginia. The blazons were as follows:

Because the design included the royal crown and quarterings of the royal arms, The Queen had to approve the design before the devisal could be made. The design was one used by the Virginia Merchants and Colony of Virginia from around 1620 until 1776.

<doc id="1203787" wikidata="Q1385316" url="?curid=1203787" title="Plasma cutting">
<text>Plasma cutting is a process that cuts through electrically conductive materials by means of an accelerated jet of hot plasma. Typical materials cut with a plasma torch include steel, stainless steel, aluminum, brass and copper, although other conductive metals may be cut as well. Plasma cutting is often used in fabrication shops, automotive repair and restoration, industrial construction, and salvage and scrapping operations. Due to the high speed and precision cuts combined with low cost, plasma cutting sees widespread use from large-scale industrial computer numerical control (CNC) applications down to small hobbyist shops.

The basic plasma cutting process involves creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the plasma cutter itself, through the workpiece to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit back to the plasma cutter through a grounding clamp. This is accomplished by a compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the workpiece. An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the gas nozzle and the workpiece itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the workpiece. At the same time, much of the high-velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating, i.e. cutting through, the workpiece.

Plasma cutting is an effective way of cutting thin and thick materials alike. Hand-held torches can usually cut up to thick steel plate, and stronger computer-controlled torches can cut steel up to thick. Since plasma cutters produce a very hot and very localized &quot;cone&quot; to cut with, they are extremely useful for cutting sheet metal in curved or angled shapes.

The arcs are generated in a three step process. A high voltage spark briefly ionizes the air within the torch head. This makes the air conductive and allows the &quot;pilot arc&quot; to form. The pilot arc forms within the torch head, with current flowing from the electrode to the nozzle inside the torch head. The pilot arc begins to burn up the nozzle, a consumable part, while in this phase. The air then blows the plasma out the nozzle towards the work, providing a current path from the electrode to the work. When the control system senses current flowing from the electrode to the work, it cuts the electrical connection to the nozzle. Current then flows from the electrode to the work, and the arc forms outside the nozzle. Cutting can then proceed, without burning up the nozzle. Nozzle life is limited by the number of arc starts, not cutting time.

==History==
Plasma cutting grew out of plasma welding in the 1960s, and emerged as a very productive way to cut sheet metal and plate in the 1980s. It had the advantages over traditional &quot;metal against metal&quot; cutting of producing no metal chips, giving accurate cuts, and producing a cleaner edge than oxy-fuel cutting. Early plasma cutters were large, somewhat slow and expensive and, therefore, tended to be dedicated to repeating cutting patterns in a &quot;mass production&quot; mode.

As with other machine tools, CNC (computer numerical control) technology was applied to plasma cutting machines in the late 1980s into the 1990s, giving plasma cutting machines greater flexibility to cut diverse shapes &quot;on demand&quot; based on a set of instructions that were programmed into the machine&#x27;s numerical control. These CNC plasma cutting machines were, however, generally limited to cutting patterns and parts in flat sheets of steel, using only two axes of motion (referred to as X Y cutting).

==Safety==
Proper eye protection and face shields are needed to prevent eye damage called arc eye as well as damage from debris. It is recommended to use green lens shade #5. OSHA recommends a shade 8 for arc current less than 300 A, but notes that &quot;These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when the arc is hidden by the workpiece.&quot; Lincoln Electric, a manufacturer of plasma cutting equipment, says, &quot;Typically a darkness shade of #7 to #9 is acceptable.&quot; Longevity Global, Inc., another manufacturer, offers this more specific table for eye protection for plasma arc cutting at lower amperages:

Leather gloves, an apron and a jacket are also recommended to prevent burns from sparks and hot metal.

Working in a clean area free of flammable liquids, materials and gases is very important. Sparks and hot metal from a plasma cutter can quickly cause fires if they are not isolated from flammable objects. Plasma cutters can send hot sparks flying up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) away in certain situations. Machine operators are typically blind to any fire that has started because they are behind their face shields. 

==Starting methods==
Plasma cutters use a number of methods to start the arc. In some units, the arc is created by putting the torch in contact with the work piece. Some cutters use a high voltage, high frequency circuit to start the arc. This method has a number of disadvantages, including risk of electrocution, difficulty of repair, spark gap maintenance, and the large amount of radio frequency emissions. Plasma cutters working near sensitive electronics, such as CNC hardware or computers, start the pilot arc by other means. The nozzle and electrode are in contact. The nozzle is the cathode, and the electrode is the anode. When the plasma gas begins to flow, the nozzle is blown forward. A third, less common method is capacitive discharge into the primary circuit via a silicon controlled rectifier.

==Inverter plasma cutters==

Analog plasma cutters, typically requiring more than 2 kilowatts, use a heavy mains-frequency transformer. Inverter plasma cutters rectify the mains supply to DC, which is fed into a high-frequency transistor inverter between 10 kHz to about 200 kHz. Higher switching frequencies allow smaller transformers resulting in overall size and weight reduction.

The transistors used were initially MOSFETs, but are now increasingly using IGBTs. With paralleled MOSFETs, if one of the transistors activates prematurely it can lead to a cascading failure of one quarter of the inverter. A later invention, IGBTs, are not as subject to this failure mode. IGBTs can be generally found in high-current machines where it is not possible to parallel enough MOSFET transistors.

The switch mode topology is referred to as a dual transistor off-line forward converter. Although lighter and more powerful, some inverter plasma cutters, especially those without power factor correction, cannot be run from a generator (that means manufacturer of the inverter unit forbids doing so; it is only valid for small, light portable generators). However newer models have internal circuitry that allows units without power factor correction to run on light power generators.

==CNC cutting methods==

Some plasma cutter manufacturers build CNC cutting tables, and some have the cutter built into the table. CNC tables allow a computer to control the torch head producing clean sharp cuts. Modern CNC plasma equipment is capable of multi-axis cutting of thick material, allowing opportunities for complex welding seams that are not possible otherwise. For thinner material, plasma cutting is being progressively replaced by laser cutting, due mainly to the laser cutter&#x27;s superior hole-cutting abilities.

A specialized use of CNC plasma cutters has been in the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. Software processes information on ductwork and creates flat patterns to be cut on the cutting table by the plasma torch. This technology has enormously increased productivity within the industry since its introduction in the early 1980s.

CNC plasma cutters are also used in many workshops to create decorative metalwork. For instance, commercial and residential signage, wall art, address signs, and outdoor garden art.

In recent years there has been even more development. Traditionally the machines&#x27; cutting tables were horizontal, but now vertical CNC plasma cutting machines are available, providing for a smaller footprint, increased flexibility, optimum safety and faster operation.

== CNC plasma cutting configurations ==
There are three main configurations of CNC plasma cutting, and they are largely differentiated by the forms of materials before processing, and the flexibility of the cutting head.

=== 2-dimensional / 2-axis plasma cutting ===
This is the most common and conventional form of CNC plasma cutting. Producing flat profiles, where the cut edges are at 90 degrees to the material surface. High powered CNC plasma cutting beds are configured in this way, able to cut profiles from metal plate up to 150 mm thick.

=== 3-dimensional / 3+ axis plasma cutting ===
Once again, a process for producing flat profiles from sheet or plate metal, however with the introduction of an additional axis of rotation, the cutting head of a CNC plasma cutting machine can tilt whilst being taken through a conventional 2-dimensional cutting path. The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the CNC plasma cutting process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost. The angular cutting capability of 3-dimensional plasma cutting can also be used to create countersunk holes and chamfer edges of profiled holes.

=== Tube and section plasma cutting ===
Used in the processing of tube, pipe or any form of long section. The plasma cutting head usually remains stationary whilst the workpiece is fed through, and rotated around its longitudinal axis. There are some configurations where, as with 3-dimensional plasma cutting, the cutting head can tilt and rotate. This allows angled cuts to be made through the thickness of the tube or section, commonly taken advantage of in the fabrication of process pipework where cut pipe can be provided with a weld preparation in place of a straight edge.

==New technology==
In the past decade plasma torch manufacturers have engineered new models with a smaller nozzle and a thinner plasma arc. This allows near-laser precision on plasma cut edges. Several manufacturers have combined precision CNC control with these torches to allow fabricators to produce parts that require little or no finishing.

==Costs==
Plasma torches were once quite expensive. For this reason they were usually only found in professional welding shops and very well-stocked private garages and shops. However, modern plasma torches are becoming cheaper, and now are within the price range of many hobbyists, less than $300. Older units may be very heavy, but still portable, while some newer ones with inverter technology weigh only a little, yet equal or exceed the capacities of older ones.

<doc id="1203794" wikidata="Q1753042" url="?curid=1203794" title="Honky Château">
<text>Honky Château is the fifth studio album by English musician Elton John. It was released on 19 May 1972, and was titled after the 18th century French chateau where it was recorded, Château d&#x27;Hérouville. The album reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the first of John&#x27;s seven consecutive US number one albums.

Two singles were released worldwide from &quot;Honky Château&quot;, &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and &quot;Honky Cat&quot;. A third single, &quot;Hercules&quot;, was prepared for release, but this never materialised. This was the final Elton John album on the Uni label in the US and Canada before MCA consolidated all of its various labels under the MCA brand. This and John&#x27;s earlier Uni albums were later reissued on MCA Records.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 357 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was revised to number 359 in 2012, and raised to number 251 in a 2020 list. It was certified gold in July 1972 and platinum in October 1995 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Music==
&quot;Honky Château&quot; was the first in Elton John&#x27;s streak of chart-topping albums in the US, which culminated with 1975&#x27;s &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;. It was also the first studio album to feature John&#x27;s road band of Dee Murray on bass and Nigel Olsson on drums, along with new member Davey Johnstone on electric and acoustic guitars and other fretted instruments, as the core group of musicians. Previously, the record label insisted that John use them for only one track each on &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; and &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;; the rest of the songs on those two albums were performed by session players. Johnstone had played acoustic guitar, mandolin and sitar on &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;, but on &quot;Honky Château&quot;, he would be invited to join permanently as a full-band member and he extended his contributions to electric guitar, banjo, slide guitar and backing vocals.

The opening track, &quot;Honky Cat&quot;, is a New Orleans funk track reminiscent of Dr. John and Allen Toussaint, and features a four-piece horn section arranged by producer Gus Dudgeon. Also of note is the on-record debut of the backing vocal combination of Johnstone, Murray and Olsson, who first added what would soon become their &quot;trademark&quot; sound to &quot;Rocket Man&quot;. The trio&#x27;s unique approach to arranging their backing vocal tracks would be a fixture on John&#x27;s singles and albums for the next several years.

In 1995, Dudgeon remastered the album, adding only an uptempo, piano-based, rock and roll version of &quot;Slave&quot;, that was originally sidelined in favour of the slower, guitar-based version on the original LP. This alternate version was originally due to be released as the B-side to the ultimately unreleased &quot;Hercules&quot; single. It did not get an official release until it appeared on the compilation &quot;Rare Masters&quot; in 1992.

In February 2023, John announced the album would be reissued in a 50th-anniversary edition on LP (two versions: double-LP set and single LP on gold vinyl) and 2 CDs. The double LP and 2-CD configurations include outtakes from the original session tapes. The 2-CD format additionally contains eight live recordings from the Royal Festival Hall show in 1972. It was released on 24 March 2023.

==Reception==
===Critical appraisal===
Critically, &quot;Honky Château&quot; is regarded as one of John&#x27;s finest records. Jon Landau of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; approved the original LP as &quot;a rich, warm, satisfying album that stands head and shoulders above the morass of current releases&quot;. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn hailed the music as innovative and Bernie Taupin&#x27;s lyrics as humorous, ironic and satirical.

Retrospective reviews of &quot;Honky Château&quot; have also been mostly positive&quot;.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote of the album that it &quot;plays as the most focused and accomplished set of songs Elton John and Bernie Taupin ever wrote,&quot; and characterized it as being an eclectic collection of &quot;ballads, rockers, blues, country-rock, and soul songs.&quot;. Chris Roberts also praised the album in a review for BBC, saying that the album &quot;stands up as one of [John&#x27;s] most eclectic, durable collections&quot;.

===Chart success===
&quot;Honky Château&quot; became the first of a string of albums by Elton John to hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in the US. In Canada, the album peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;RPM 100&quot; Top Albums Chart, reaching this position on 29 July 1972, dropping two places to No. 5, then returning to No. 3 for a further twelve consecutive weeks before falling to No. 9 on 4 November of the same year.

<doc id="1203811" wikidata="Q4757529" url="?curid=1203811" title="Andrew Jones (Australian politician)">
<text>Andrew Thomas Jones (26 May 1944 – 2 December 2015) was an Australian politician. He became one of the youngest ever Australian federal Members of Parliament when he was elected to the Division of Adelaide on 26 November 1966, aged just 22 years and 184 days. At that time, only Edwin Corboy had been elected at a younger age, but that record has since been broken by Wyatt Roy.
Born in Adelaide, Jones studied at the University of Adelaide and was working as a travel officer when he gained Liberal and Country League (LCL) preselection for the apparently safe Labor seat of Adelaide for the 1966 federal election. Although the election came at a bad time for Labor at both the federal and state level, few gave Jones any chance of winning. However, much to the surprise of everyone except Jones, he defeated Labor incumbent Joe Sexton. He took a narrow lead on the first count, but received an overwhelming flow of Democratic Labor Party preferences on the second count, enough for a 10 percent two-party preferred swing and 52.8 percent of the vote.

Jones ruffled feathers with his views, which were extremely conservative even by general LCL standards of the time. For instance, he called alcohol &quot;the devil&#x27;s urine&quot;, and claimed that &quot;half the MPs in Parliament are drunk half the time&quot;. He was forced to publicly apologise on the floor of the House for the latter remarks. Jones caused further controversy by releasing a book, entitled &quot;Andrew Jones M.H.R by Himself&quot;, in which he made further comments on the &quot;wickedness&quot; of parliament, as well as a spoken word record.

The spoken-word record, &quot;Shadow Valley and Iron Triangles&quot; by &quot;The Young Australians&quot;, described by Jones as &quot;anti-Communist&quot;, by his supporters as &quot;a reaction against the spate of sick immoral and depraved pseudo-folk music which pours from the radio&quot; and by detractors as &quot;awful&quot; or &quot;pure jingoism&quot;, was a local Adelaide hit for Jones, who donated the proceeds to charity. It included such lines as &quot;When you hear the anthem lift up your head, remember our past, see our glorious future and let your voice sing out, and friend, thank God you&#x27;re free.&quot; At least one Adelaide radio announcer refused to play the song.

Jones&#x27; conservatism didn&#x27;t play well in what was an ancestrally Labor seat. He was resoundingly defeated by Labor challenger Chris Hurford at the 1969 election, suffering a 14.3 percent two-party swing to finish with 38.7 percent of the two-party vote. Hurford won enough votes on the first count to defeat Jones without the need for preferences. Following the loss, Jones&#x27;s reasoning to Prime Minister John Gorton for his defeat, &quot;not even Jesus Christ could have held Adelaide&quot;, quickly entered Australian political folklore. Jones later unsuccessfully ran as an independent candidate for the Senate at the 1977 federal election before moving to Western Australia and assuming a low profile.

<doc id="1203814" wikidata="Q7129165" url="?curid=1203814" title="Pamela Hansford Johnson">
<text>Pamela Hansford Johnson, Baroness Snow, (29 May 1912 – 18 June 1981) was an English novelist, playwright, poet, literary and social critic.

==Life==
Johnson was born in London. Her mother, Amy Clotilda Howson, was a singer and actress, from a theatrical family. Her mother&#x27;s father, C E Howson, worked for the London Lyceum Company, as Sir Henry Irving&#x27;s Treasurer. Her father, Reginald Kenneth Johnson, was a colonial civil servant who spent much of his life working in Nigeria. Her father died when she was 11 years old, leaving debts. Her mother earned a living as a typist. Until Pamela was 22, the family lived at 53 Battersea Rise, Clapham, South London.

Johnson attended Clapham County Girls Grammar School, where she excelled at English, art history, and drama. After leaving school at the age of 16, she took a secretarial course and later worked for several years at the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. She began her literary career by writing poems, which were published by Victor Neuburg in the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot;. In 1933, Johnson wrote to Dylan Thomas, who had also been published in the same paper, and a friendship developed. Marriage was considered, but the idea was ultimately abandoned.

In 1936 she married an Australian journalist, Gordon Neil Stewart. Their son Andrew was born in 1941, and a daughter Lindsay, Baroness Avebury (born 1944). Johnson and her first husband Neil were divorced in 1949. In 1950, she married her second husband, the novelist C. P. Snow (later Baron Snow). Their son Philip was born in 1952.

She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and received a CBE in 1975. She was awarded the honorary degrees of Hon. DLitt (Temple University, Philadelphia 1963; York University, Toronto; Widener University, Chester, Pennsylvania) and Hon. DHL (Louisville, Kentucky). She was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University, of Timothy Dwight College, Yale University and of Founders College, York University, Toronto and held visiting academic positions at other North American universities including Harvard, Berkeley, Haverford and Cornell. She suffered from migraine for much of her career and wrote about the condition in her autobiographical memoirs &quot;Important to me&quot; and her novel &quot;The Humbler Creation&quot;. She was the first president of the Migraine Association and a founding trustee of the Migraine Trust. 

C. P. Snow died in July 1980. Less than a year later, Pamela Hansford Johnson died in London. Her ashes were scattered on the river Avon, at Stratford upon Avon.

==Works==
Johnson wrote 27 novels. Her first novel, &quot;This Bed Thy Centre&quot;, was published in 1935. Her last novel, &quot;A Bonfire&quot;, was published in the year of her death, 1981. Her themes centred on the moral responsibility of the individual in their personal and social relations.

Her first novel, &quot;This Bed Thy Centre,&quot; caused some controversy on its release. Irish novelist Sean Ó Faoláin, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, said &quot;Miss Johnson... has circumscribed herself so much by insisting on the reality of sex that her &#x27;bed&#x27; might be thought less a centre than a circumference&quot;. However, the book was positively reviewed by Ralph Straus in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Compton Mackenzie in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and Cyril Connolly in The New Statesman.

Wendy Pollard, writing in her 2014 biography of Johnson, suggests that Dylan Thomas, who suggested the title of &quot;This Bed Thy Centre&quot;, was influenced by the opening chapter when he came to write &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, as both works describe the different characters of their setting as the day begins.

The 1959 novel &quot;The Unspeakable Skipton&quot; was another high point of Johnson&#x27;s critical appraisal. The critic Walter Allen described her as &quot;as good as any novelist writing in this country today&quot;, and that her writing was in the realist tradition of George Eliot. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; said Johnson &quot;has become known to the reading public as a novelist of great craftsmanship and distinction&quot;. In her introduction to a 2002 reprint of the novel, Ruth Rendell wrote that Johnson was &quot;undeservedly forgotten today just as, in her lifetime, she was undeservedly overshadowed by her husband C. P. Snow... Revival for his work is unlikely while her&#x27;s is overdue. She possessed the imagination and the ability he lacked to write lyrical but never &quot;purple&quot; prose, and there is no finer example in her canon than &quot;The Unspeakable Skipton&quot;.&quot;

The fictional genres she used ranged from romantic comedy (&quot;Night and Silence Who is Here?&quot;) and high comedy (&quot;The Unspeakable Skipton&quot;) to tragedy (&quot;The Holiday Friend&quot;) and the psychological study of cruelty (&quot;An Error of Judgement&quot;). She also wrote two detective novels, jointly with her first husband Neil Stewart, under the joint pseudonym Nap Lombard. She wrote seven short plays, six of them in collaboration with C. P. Snow. She published a number of critical works, short stories, verse, sociological studies, and a collection of autobiographical essays. She reviewed extensively for magazines and newspapers and broadcast on the BBC radio programme &quot;The Critics&quot;. 
In the 2010s, some of Johnson&#x27;s novels were republished by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and Macmillan in their Bello imprint. Reviewing five novels published by Hodder, Philip Hensher noted that &quot;Johnson was an effective reporter from a particular streak of suburban London, and explored, almost without knowing, the mores and conventions of a forgotten way of living.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s biographer Deirdre David concluded that &quot;Working in the moral tradition of George Eliot, with the commitment to social justice found in Charles Dickens, and with an unwavering belief that an important task of the English novel was the depiction of everyday life to be discovered from Jane Austen to Anthony Trollope, she was sometimes dismissed as a &#x27;middlebrow&#x27; novelist who happily catered to her undemanding readers.&quot;

David Holloway, writing Johnson&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, asserted that &quot;never for a moment did she admit in public, something that was evident to everyone who had read their books, that she was an infinitely better novelist than C.P. Snow&quot;.
