<text>The 1978 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1978 season. The 75th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. In a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s World Series, the Yankees won, four games to two, to repeat as champions and to win their 22nd World Series. As of 2024, it remains the most recent World Series to feature a rematch of the previous season&#x27;s matchup.

The 1978 series was the first of 10 consecutive years that saw 10 different teams win the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers would break the string with a World Series win in 1988, having won in 1981.

This series had two memorable confrontations between Dodgers rookie pitcher Bob Welch and the Yankees&#x27; Reggie Jackson. In Game 2, Welch struck out Jackson in the top of the ninth with two outs and the tying and go-ahead runs on base to end the game. Jackson would avenge the strikeout, when in Game 4 he singled off Welch which moved Roy White to second, from which White would score the game winning run on a Lou Piniella single to tie the series at 2-2. In Game 6, Jackson smashed a two-run homer off Welch in the seventh to increase the Yankees&#x27; lead to 7–2 and a Yankees&#x27; victory to win the series.

==Background==
===New York Yankees===
The New York Yankees were as far back as 14 games behind the Boston Red Sox at mid-July suffering from injuries to pitchers Catfish Hunter and Jim Beattie. A public display of antipathy between manager Billy Martin and slugger Reggie Jackson resulted in the replacement of Martin by the amenable, easygoing Bob Lemon on July 17. With time running out, the Yankees, four games behind the Red Sox in the American League East, began a crucial four-game series at Fenway Park in Boston. On September 7, the Yanks began the &quot;Boston Massacre&quot; with a drubbing of the BoSox, with second baseman Willie Randolph driving in five runs. (Randolph was sidelined in the postseason, due to a pulled hamstring in late September.) The assault continued with the Yankees winning game two game three (Ron Guidry winning his 21st—a two-hitter), and an 18-hit, victory in game four, completing the sweep. The Yankees and Red Sox were now tied for first place with 20 games remaining for 

New York went in their last 68 scheduled games, but lost on the final day to Cleveland to finish the regular season in a dead-heat with Boston at . The Yanks had to travel to Fenway for the one-game playoff on Monday, October 2. Down 2–0 after six innings, they won , made famous by light-hitting Bucky Dent&#x27;s clutch three-run homer in the seventh inning (his fifth of the year). Ron Guidry won his 25th game (against only three losses) and Goose Gossage recorded the last eight outs for his 27th save, retiring Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski with the tying run at third base for the final out.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
In the National League the Los Angeles Dodgers were locked in a tight three-way race with the rival San Francisco Giants and Cincinnati Reds falling as far as games back. Taking a lesson from the in-fighting Yankees, this normally close-knit group caught fire after a clubhouse fight between teammates Steve Garvey and Don Sutton in August, ultimately finishing games ahead of the Cincinnati Reds. Unlike the 1977 Dodgers with four 30+ home run hitters, this squad&#x27;s leader in home runs was Reggie Smith with 29. No pitcher won 20 or more games but five pitchers did win at least ten games. Rookie Bob Welch was a key after being promoted from the minors, winning seven games and saving three while being utilized as both a starter and reliever.

During the World Series the Dodgers wore on their uniforms a black patch with the number 19 in dedication to coach Jim Gilliam, who died from a brain hemorrhage two days before the start of the Series. His uniform number was retired by the Dodgers prior to the start of Game 1. Davey Lopes, the Dodgers player closest to Gilliam, led the Series in home runs (3) and the team in slugging percentage (.654), on-base plus slugging (1.011) and runs scored and batted in (7 each). His inspired play left Reggie Jackson saying, &quot;Lopes is blatantly penetrated by the spirit of Gilliam.&quot;

===League Championship Series===

In a repeat of the 1977 playoffs the Yankees again dispatched the Kansas City Royals, this time three games to one as the Dodgers did the same to the Philadelphia Phillies by the same margin. After losing the first two games of the World Series, the Yankees would become the first team to come back to win the Series in six. The Dodgers would duplicate that feat against the Yankees in the 1981 World Series.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
With Yankee ace Ron Guidry unavailable at least until Game 3, the Dodgers pounded 20-game winner Ed Figueroa. Figueroa left after two innings, allowing home runs to Dusty Baker and Davey Lopes. Lopes would add a three-run shot in the fourth off Ken Clay to make it 6–0. Another Dodger run crossed the plate in the fifth; Ron Cey scoring on a Clay wild pitch.

The Yankees tried to claw back in the seventh as Reggie Jackson homered and Bucky Dent singled in two runs, but the Dodgers bounced back with three of their own, two coming on a Bill North double. The Dodgers would cruise to an easy Game 1 win from there.

===Game 2===
Ron Cey drove in all the Dodgers&#x27; runs with a single in the fourth and a three-run homer in the sixth off Yankee starter Catfish Hunter. Reggie Jackson would try to keep pace by batting in all three of the Yankee runs with a two-run double and RBI groundout, but this game would be remembered for one memorable Jackson at-bat.

Rookie Bob Welch was brought in to pitch the ninth to save the game for Burt Hooton. The previous reliever, Terry Forster, had allowed Bucky Dent and Paul Blair to reach base between outs, bringing up Jackson. Welch ran the count to 3–2. Jackson fouled off several pitches before Welch finally got a fastball by him, sending the Dodger Stadium crowd into a frenzy.

In post-game interviews, Jackson initially blamed his striking out on Bucky Dent running from second with the 3–2 pitch and distracting him from focusing on Welch. In later interviews, however, Jackson would give Welch his proper due.

===Game 3===
With the Yankees desperately needing a win, ace Ron Guidry provided a victory aided by the stunning defense of third baseman Graig Nettles.

Guidry pitched a complete game, even though he allowed eight hits, walked seven, and struck out only four. Nettles&#x27; defense saved at least four runs.

The Yankees got on the board in the first off Don Sutton on a Roy White homer and added a run in the second on an RBI forceout by Bucky Dent.

In the third, the Dodgers began to come back against Guidry, who clearly did not have his best stuff. Bill North led off with a walk, stole second, then went to third on a Steve Yeager groundout. Davey Lopes hit a hard liner Nettles snared to turn a certain extra-base hit into a key out and temporarily save a run. Bill Russell followed with an infield single to score North and drive in the Dodgers&#x27; only run. The next batter, Reggie Smith, hit a hard ground ball to third. Nettles made a diving stop to save another extra-base hit and probable run, and threw Smith out at first to end the inning.

In the fifth, the Dodgers had runners on first and second with two outs when Smith came up to bat. Nettles knocked down Smith&#x27;s sharply hit ground ball down the third base line. Smith reached first, but no runs scored. Steve Garvey, the next batter up, hit another hard ground ball down the third base line, and Nettles made a backhanded stop and forced Smith at second base to end the inning. The Dodgers loaded the bases again with two outs in the sixth inning, but Nettles again made a great stop on a ball hit by Davey Lopes, and threw to second to complete the inning-ending force play.

The Yankees would later add three more runs. Thurman Munson and Reggie Jackson had RBI singles in the rally that put the game out of reach.

===Game 4===
Starters Ed Figueroa and Tommy John were locked in a scoreless duel before Reggie Smith struck with a three-run homer in the top of the fifth inning. John continued his shutout through the fifth, but, in the Yankees&#x27; half of the sixth, they scored.

Reggie Jackson finally got the Yankees on the board with a one-out RBI single. With Thurman Munson on second and Jackson on first, Lou Piniella hit a low, soft liner that shortstop Bill Russell fumbled (some claim intentionally). Russell recovered the ball, then stepped on second to force Jackson, then his attempted throw to first to complete the double play struck a &quot;confused&quot; Jackson in the right hip and caromed into foul territory. Munson scored, partially because first baseman Steve Garvey stopped to yell at the first-base umpire over the non-interference call before retrieving the ball.
The Dodgers&#x27; protests went for naught but would not have been necessary if Russell had made the proper play.
Thinking Russell was going to catch Piniella&#x27;s liner, Munson retreated towards second and was &quot;on&quot; second base when Russell picked up the ball. Munson then turned to third and Russell stepped on second to force Jackson and threw to first. The inning would have been over if Russell had tagged Munson (out #2) and stepped on second (out #3) to force Jackson &quot;or&quot; Russell steps on second to force Jackson (out #2) and gets Munson in a rundown between second and third (out #3); the score would have remained 3–1, instead the score was then 3–2. But of course, Russell had no reason to the think his throw would not reach first base.

Later review of the play clearly showed Jackson had stopped midway between first and second when Russell had made his throw to first. As the ball carried very close to Jackson&#x27;s immediate right, Jackson had moved his hips to the right just as the ball sailed past, deflecting the ball down the first base line. While Jackson continued to deny it, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, along with other eyewitnesses, steadfastly believed the Yankees outfielder purposefully interfered in the play.

The Yankees tied it in the eighth when Munson doubled home Paul Blair. The score remained tied until the bottom of the tenth inning. Dodgers rookie and Game 2 hero Bob Welch walked Roy White with one out. After Welch retired Munson, Jackson strode to the plate for his first confrontation with Welch since Game 2. This time, Jackson got the better end by singling White to second. Lou Piniella then lined a single to center, scoring White and tying the series.

The bungled Russell/Jackson play changed the game and the entire Series; instead of the Dodgers going up 3–1 in games, the Series was then tied and the momentum shifted to the Yankees who outscored the Dodgers 19–4 in the final two games.

===Game 5===
The Yankees took one step closer to a repeat World Series championship on the strength of an unexpected complete game victory by young Jim Beattie. Beattie scattered nine Dodgers hits and was buoyed by an 18-hit Yankees performance, including a World Series-record 16 singles.

Early on, the Dodgers tried to run to take advantage of a sore-shouldered Thurman Munson behind the plate. Davey Lopes led off the game with a single, stole second, and scored on a Reggie Smith single. The Dodgers stretched their lead to 2–0 in the third when Lopes scored again on a double by Bill Russell.

But, that would be it as Beattie settled down and shut out the Dodgers the rest of the way. In the bottom of the third, after a leadoff walk and single, Roy White&#x27;s RBI single cut the Dodgers&#x27; lead to 2–1. After a double steal, Munson&#x27;s two-run single put the Yankees up 3–2. One out later, Lou Piniella&#x27;s RBI single made it 4–2 Yankees and knocked starter Burt Hooton out of the game. Next inning, after two one-out singles, Mickey Rivers&#x27;s RBI single and White&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 6–2 Yankees. Charlie Hough relieved Lance Rautzhan and allowed an RBI single to Munson. In the seventh, with runners on second and third and two outs, a strike three wild pitch by Hough to Rivers allowed a run to score and Rivers to reach first. White&#x27;s RBI single made it 9–2 Yankees, then Munson&#x27;s two-run double increased their lead to 11–2. They scored one more run in the eighth on Bucky Dent&#x27;s RBI double off Hough as their 12–2 win gave them a 3–2 series lead heading back to Los Angeles.

===Game 6===
Game 6 turned out to be the Bucky Dent–Brian Doyle show.

Davey Lopes gave the Dodgers home crowd a ray of hope with a leadoff home run off Catfish Hunter. Dent and Doyle put the Yankees ahead in the second; Doyle with an RBI double, Dent with an RBI single and an additional run scoring on an error on the play. Lopes had an RBI single in the third to cut it to 3–2 through the fifth inning, but that would be it for the Dodgers. Sutton pitched well until the sixth inning.

Dent and Doyle pushed the score to 5–2 in the sixth with RBI singles and Reggie Jackson put the final nail in the Dodgers coffin with a tremendous two-run blast in the seventh inning to get revenge against his Game 2 nemesis, Bob Welch.

Dent would be named World Series MVP, batting .417 with ten hits, seven RBI, and three runs scored. Doyle would make a claim for the MVP himself with a .438 average, seven hits, two RBI, and four runs.

While Lopes had a monster series with three homers and seven RBIs and Bill Russell had 11 hits, the Dodgers power hitters lack of production and the Dodgers shoddy defense was their downfall. Steve Garvey (5–for–24, no RBIs) was no factor, and neither were Dusty Baker (5–for–21, one RBI) or Ron Cey (no RBIs after Game 2) and the Dodgers defense committed seven errors.

Thurman Munson caught the final out of the game on a foul pop by Cey. This would be the final post-season game for Thurman Munson before his death during the 1979 season.

1978 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.)
==Broadcasting==
NBC televised the Series, with Joe Garagiola on play-by-play and Tony Kubek and Tom Seaver providing color analysis. Curt Gowdy hosted the pregame shows and conducted interviews. This was the final World Series broadcast for Gowdy, who&#x27;d previously called play-by-play of the event for NBC from 1966 to 1975.

CBS Radio also broadcast the Series, with Yankees announcer Bill White calling the games in Los Angeles, Dodgers announcer Ross Porter calling the games in New York, and Win Elliot providing color commentary. This was the last time that local announcers for the participating teams would call games on the national World Series radio broadcast.

==Aftermath==
This Series is tied with the 1980 World Series for the highest overall television ratings to date, with the six games averaging a Nielsen rating of 32.8 and a share of 56.

The Yankees became the last repeat World Champions until 15 years later (–; Toronto Blue Jays). This was the last time the Yankees won a World Series until , and the last World Series championship for the city of New York until the Yankees&#x27; cross-town rivals, the Mets, won in when they defeated the Red Sox four games to three. The Dodgers won the World Series in , against the Yankees in the same way the Yankees won this series (losing the first two games, then winning the next four), and , against the Oakland Athletics. For the Yankees, they again lost the first two games of the World Series in 1996 against the Atlanta Braves, then won the next four games.

As of 2024, this would mark the last time that the Yankees have won a World Series against the Dodgers.

<text>Derek Riggs (born 13 February 1958) is a contemporary British artist best known for creating the band Iron Maiden&#x27;s mascot, &quot;Eddie&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Portsmouth, England, Riggs is a self-taught artist, both in his traditional painting and in his digital work. He began drawing and painting as early as he can remember. He also attended art school, but he was expelled after complaining about the course. Riggs&#x27; most famous achievement is his work with Iron Maiden and his creation of Eddie, the band&#x27;s mascot and subject of their album and single covers. Riggs&#x27; first picture of Eddie was originally entitled &quot;Electric Matthew Says Hello,&quot; and was actually painted for a possible punk cover. Iron Maiden&#x27;s management came across it while looking through Riggs&#x27; portfolio, and asked him to add hair to the figure to make it look less punk-like. The resulting picture was used for the debut album, &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;, released in 1980, and Riggs went on to work with Iron Maiden throughout the 1980s and into the &#x27;90s, creating many of the band&#x27;s famous album covers. In 1992, however, the band decided to accept contributions from other artists for their next album, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, resulting in much less input from Riggs in recent years.

For a long time, Riggs did his paintings with acrylics and alkyd, which is a fast-drying oil-based paint. However, after realizing the chemicals were affecting his health, he switched to digital painting in the early 1990s. His choice of software include Bryce, Strata Studio Pro, and Photoshop.

Riggs has also designed the cover of &quot;World&#x27;s Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;, the self-titled debut album by the all-female tribute band, the Iron Maidens, a piece which was inspired by the &quot;Killers&quot; album, featuring a similar &quot;Kinky Sex Shop&quot; which featured in the &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; artwork.

He has also worked with Iron Maiden lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson for his album &quot;Accident of Birth&quot;, Stratovarius for their album &quot;Infinite&quot;, Gamma Ray for their &quot;Power Plant&quot; album, Artension on their 2004 album &quot;Future World&quot;, Gillman on their 2003 album Cuauhtemoc, and with many other bands and companies most of which are featured on his website.

Riggs currently resides in Riverside County, California, US. He has seasonal affective disorder.

==Tribute==
As a fan of Iron Maiden, game designer Tim Schafer named the main character of 2009&#x27;s video game Brütal Legend Eddie Riggs, which is a combination of Eddie The Head and Derek Riggs.

<text>Brigadier-General Paul Aloysius Kenna, VC, DSO (16 August 1862 – 30 August 1915) was an English-born British Army officer of Irish descent and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to British and British Empire forces. He also competed at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

==Background==
He was the son of James Kenna, of Liverpool, who was descended from a family of minor gentry from County Meath. Kenna was educated first at St.Francis Xavier&#x27;s College, Salisbury Street, Liverpool, then, after his father&#x27;s death, at St. Augustine&#x27;s College in Ramsgate 1874-9, and, from the age of 17, at Stonyhurst College. He is honoured in a memorial which can be seen in the main hall of the current St.Francis Xavier&#x27;s College site in Beaconsfield Road, Liverpool, on the war memorial at St.Augustine&#x27;s Church in Ramsgate and by a plaque and a portrait at Stonyhurst.

==Military career==
After serving in the 4th (Militia) Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, into which he was commissioned as a lieutenant in December 1882, Kenna, having resigned his commission in August 1884, attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was re-commissioned into the British Army as a lieutenant in the 2nd West India Regiment on 25 August 1886, In 1887 he transferred once again, this time to the 21st Lancers (Empress of India&#x27;s), and was promoted to captain on 12 June 1895. In that year he also received the Royal Humane Society&#x27;s Certificate for saving a man from the river Liffey.

===VC action===
He was 36 years old, serving as a captain in the 21st Lancers during the Mahdist War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

:On 2 September 1898, at the Battle of Omdurman, Sudan, when a major of the 21st Lancers was in danger, as his horse had been shot in the charge, Captain Kenna took the major up on his own horse, to a place of safety. After the charge Captain Kenna returned to help Lieutenant De Montmorency who was trying to recover the body of an officer who had been killed.

He later served in the Second Boer War in South Africa 1899–1900, and, after being made a brigade major with the 4th Cavalry Brigade in July 1900, was promoted to brevet major on 29 November. For his service during the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the South Africa Honours List published on 26 June 1902.

Following the end of the war that month Kenna returned to the United Kingdom in the &quot;RMS Dunottar Castle&quot;, which arrived at Southampton in July 1902. He received the substantive rank of major on 7 September, on his appointment to lead a mounted infantry flying column in Somaliland. He arrived there to take part in the 1903 Somaliland campaign, which ended in British retreat. He was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in September 1904 and in October 1905 he became brigade major of the 1st Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot. He held this post until September 1906, when he was made a lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 21st Lancers.

In September 1910 he relinquished command of his regiment and was placed on half-pay and promoted to colonel on the same date. In April 1912 he was appointed to command the Notts and Derby (Yeomanry) Mounted Brigade and on the outbreak of war over two years later was appointed brigadier-general.

==Olympics==
He competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics for Great Britain as a horse rider. He did not finish the Individual eventing (Military) competition, also the British team did not finish the team event. In the individual jumping event he finished 27th.
==First World War==
He was killed in action at Suvla, Turkey during the Battle of Gallipoli on 30 August 1915, aged 53 and is buried in Lala Baba Cemetery.

His Victoria Cross medal is on display in The Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum in Thoresby Park, Nottinghamshire.

==Family==
Kenna married Lady Cecil Bertie, daughter of the 7th Earl of Abingdon. He married, secondly, Angela Mary, daughter of Herbert Hibbert. They had one daughter, Kathleen (died 1998) 

His first cousin, Margaret (née) Larkin (granddaughter of his grandfather Patrick Kenna) married Simon Mangan, HM Lieutenant for County Meath. Their grandson was Group Captain Nicolas Tindal-Carill-Worsley.

<doc id="1219530" wikidata="Q7587089" url="?curid=1219530" title="St. Anthony Hall">
<text>St. Anthony Hall or the Fraternity of Delta Psi is an American fraternity and literary society. Its first chapter was founded at Columbia University on , the feast day of Saint Anthony the Great. The fraternity is a non–religious, nonsectarian organization. In 1879, William Raimond Baird&#x27;s &quot;American College Fraternities&quot; characterized the fraternity as having &quot;the reputation of being the most secret of all the college societies.&quot; A 2015 writer for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; says the fraternity is &quot;a cross between Skull and Bones and a Princeton eating club, with a large heaping of Society and more than a dash of &quot;Animal House&quot;.&quot; Nearly all chapters of St. Anthony Hall are coed.

References to St. Anthony Hall have appeared in the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, John O&#x27;Hara, and Tom Wolfe.

==History==
According to &quot;Baird&#x27;s&quot;, the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; of the Fraternity of Delta Psi was founded at Columbia University in by John Hone Anthon, Sam. F. Barger, Charles Arms Budd, and William Myn Van Wagener. In &quot;The&quot; &quot;Review&quot; magazine, the fraternity says Anthon was a founder and the first leader of the fraternity. (He would later serve as grand master, i.e. president, of Freemasons in New York, for the term 1870-71.) Another source says Delta Psi was started by the fifteen-year-old Edward Forbes Travis who came to Columbia University from England &quot;with an odd fascination for St. Anthony the Great, the gnarled fourth-century mystic.&quot; In this scenario, Travis shared &quot;certain rituals&quot; with a Charles Arms Budd on the saint&#x27;s feast day, creating &quot;a sacred bond that was soon extended to others.&quot;

According to its national website, Delta Psi was founded on the feast day of Saint Anthony the Great as a &quot;fraternity dedicated to the love of education and the well-being of its members.&quot; It is a non–religious, nonsectarian organization. The fraternity developed &quot;a literary flavor: members would spend hours reading essays to one another for general critique or amusement.&quot; By 1853, it was holding an Annual Literary Festival and Dinner. It also held evenings featuring orators and poets, often publishing the poems or speeches.

A &quot;Beta chapter&quot; was formed at New York University on January 17, 1847. However &quot;Beta&quot; was short-lived; the Columbia College&#x27;s &quot;Record&quot; lists the New York University founders alongside its students. In 1879, &quot;Baird&#x27;s&quot; listed seventeen chapters opening throughout the Northeast and South during the mid-19th-century.

During the Civil War, formal contact ended between the Northern and Southern chapters, and all of the Southern chapters closed. In fact, 25% of the fraternity&#x27;s membership died in the Civil War, with 90 of the 109 deaths coming from the Southern chapters. In December 1865, the fraternity held its annual convention in New York City. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Attendance from all the Northern chapters was large, and measures were taken to give the most cordial assistance in response to applications for the rehabilitation of the Southern chapters in such of their colleges are again in operation.&quot;

Three of the Southern chapters resumed operations: the University of Virginia, the University of Mississippi, and Washington and Lee. In April 1867, eleven members of the &quot;Williams College chapter&quot; commissioned a life-sized portrait of a fallen brother; the portrait was displayed at the Schwabe Gallery of Fallen Heroes in Boston, along with the portraits of four other Delta Psi brothers. Members from many Southern chapters attended a commemorative dinner in New York City in December 1871.

In 1894, Yale&#x27;s &quot;Sigma chapter&quot; built a dormitory and named it St. Anthony Hall, apparently the first use of that name. The Fraternity of Delta Psi also became known as the Order of St. Anthony and St. Anthony Hall.

Following the respective traditions of each chapter, St. Anthony Hall is now self-described and referred to on its various campuses as a fraternity or coed fraternity, a secret society or literary society, or a private club. A former Yale chapter president said, &quot;Chapters have a range of degrees of secrecy.&quot; In 2006, a Yale member said, &quot;Our secret aspects are truly secret, and our non-secret aspects are truly non–secret.&quot;

== Symbols ==

The 1879 edition of &quot;Baird&#x27;s&quot; describes the fraternity&#x27;s badge as a &quot;Saint Anthony&#x27;s cross, with curved sides. The cross bears a shield in blue enamel displaying the letters . On the bar of the cross are engraved four Hebrew letters, and beneath the shield the skull and bones.&quot; The badge was designed by fraternity member Henry Steel Olcott in 1850.

The 1873 University of Pennsylvania yearbook illustration (see infobox above) shows a tau cross or Saint Anthony&#x27;s cross, a flat-topped shield with the letters , a skull, a sword, a key, a floating triangle, and four Hebrew letters. The sword and the key are crossed, with the skull on top.

In 1860 when the Civil War seemed inevitable, fraternal medallions were made for the brothers to attach to their uniforms so they would be recognized as a member of Delta Psi on the battlefield. A photograph of a medallion in the fraternity&#x27;s archives shows a round, gold coin with a skull as its central figure. Beneath the skull are a crossed sword and key. Encircling the outer edge of the medallion are a list of each chapter&#x27;s Greek letter and the foundation date.

== Chapters ==
There are eleven active chapters of Delta Psi, including the following active chapters noted in bold. Inactive chapters are noted in &quot;italics.&quot; Note that the now-inactive Delta Psi local fraternity at the University of Vermont (1850–2004) was never affiliated.

There have been rumors that the &quot;Lambda chapter&quot; operates underground; Williams College banned all fraternities in the 1960s, phasing them out by 1970. In 2003, &quot;The Williams Record&quot; reported that the fraternity began operating as the coed Vermont Literary Society as early as 1973. At that time, the Vermont Literary Society was meeting outside of Williamstown at a place in Vermont referred to as &quot;The Barn&quot;. The college offered amnesty to any students who came forward; however, none took advantage of the offer. Again in 2020, there were reports that the Vermont Literary Society was still active as the underground &quot;Lambda chapter&quot;. &quot;The Williams Record&quot;&#x27;s investigation noted that Williams College graduates from 2016 were serving on the board of the &quot;Lambda chapter&quot;&#x27;s alumni association. However, the paper later reported that the group disbanded in August 2020.

===Notes===
== Membership ==
Members of St. Anthony Hall call each other &quot;Brother&quot;, &quot;Sister&quot;, or &quot;Sibling&quot; according to individual preference. In 1961, the &quot;Yale chapter&quot; was the first fraternity on campus to admit a person of color. The &quot;University of North Carolina chapter&quot; was the first fraternity at its campus to admit African-American members in 1967, followed by the &quot;University of Mississippi chapter&quot;. In recent times, the fraternity&#x27;s membership has become more multicultural.

In 1969, the &quot;Yale chapter&quot; was the first to go coed, also becoming the first Yale society to accept women. Additional chapters subsequently turned coed, including Columbia University, MIT in 1969, the University of North Carolina in 1971, and Trinity College in 1985. Other chapters were reestablished as coed including, Brown University in 1983, Princeton University in 1986, and the University of Rochester in 2010. The University of Pennsylvania, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Virginia chapters remain all-male.

In 2016, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; included the &quot;Columbia University chapter&quot; of St. Anthony Hall in its list of the &quot;six most exclusive clubs of the Ivy League&quot;.

==Activities==
St. Anthony Hall members pursue their literary mandate through different programs at the various chapters. The &quot;Brown chapter&quot; publishes a literary and visual arts magazine called &quot;The Sketchbook&quot; and hosts bi-weekly literary readings. The &quot;UNC chapter&quot; hosts open mic nights, poetry readings, and art shows. The &quot;Delta chapter&quot; at the University of Pennsylvania hosts an annual lecture series with nationally significant speakers and also organizes a book drive and reading program for a local public school. The &quot;MIT chapter&quot; hosts a scholarly lecture series, coffee hours, and participates in charitable activities. The &quot;Yale chapter&quot; sponsors a public series of Sigma Seminars every two to three weeks on literature, poetry, art, and current affairs; a recent speaker was Pap Souleye Fall, a Senegalese–American interdisciplinary and comic artist. The &quot;Trinity chapter&quot; hosts its annual Clement Lectures. The &quot;Columbia chapter&quot; hosts writers to discuss their works at least once a semester and also engages in charitable fundraising.

The &quot;Trinity chapter&quot; endows a St. Anthony Professorship in Art History, several annual prizes for Trinity students, and the annual Martin W. Clement lecture. In 1970 when it went coed, the &quot;Yale chapter&quot; endowed a scholarship at Yale for women. The &quot;Yale chapter&quot; also offers the St. Anthony Hall Chase Coggins Fellowship.

== Chapter houses and buildings ==



Many of the St. Anthony Hall chapter houses were designed by well-known 19th and early 20th-century architects such as Henry Forbes Bigelow, J. Cleveland Cady, Cope and Stewardson, Wilson Eyre Jr., Heins &amp; LaFarge, Charles C. Haight, Henry Hornbostel, J. Harleston Parker, William Hamilton Russell, and Stanford White.

An 1891 newspaper feature article on American college societies illustrated fifteen chapter houses, including three from Delta Psi—Trinity, Williams, and Yale.

===&quot;Alpha&quot;: Columbia University===

The &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; originally met at the Simon DeWitt Bloodgood house. In 1879, a new building was constructed at 29 East 28th Street for the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; and its alumni group, the St. Anthony Club of New York. According to the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, it was &quot;the first of the Greek letter societies to establish in New York a club which presents many of the features of the other social clubs in the city.&quot; The &quot;Alpha chapter&#x27;s&quot; Renaissance-inspired lodge in red and yellow brick was designed by William Hamilton Russell, a member of St. Anthony Hall and an architect with the firm of James Renwick, Jr. &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; wrote, &quot;The decorations of the interior are most elaborate, and altogether it is said to be one of the most beautiful college secret society buildings in the country.&quot;

In 1885, a small addition was added to the back of the building. The &quot;St. Louis Globe–Democrat&quot; wrote, &quot;The lodge room on the Delta Psi fraternity in New York is magnificently furnished in Egyptian designs especially imported from Thebes for this purpose, at the cost of thousands of dollars...&quot; In 1990, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Old photographs show...the figure of an owl on the peaked [pyramid] roof and a plaque with the Greek letters Delta Psi over the windowless chapter room.&quot; Later alterations were made by J.A. Moore in 1899 and 1918, including adding 1.5 stories that replaced the original pyramid roof; the stone shield remains between the fourth-floor windows.

In 1895, Columbia University moved its campus north of the city to Morningside Heights. To be closer to the new campus, the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; purchased land on 434 Riverside Drive on March 23, 1897. To design a new chapter house, they hired Henry Hornbostel and George Carnegie Palmer (a member of St. Anthony Hall) of the firm of Wood, Palmer and Hornbostel. The architects&#x27; plans were filed with the city on August 26, 1898, and the building was completed in 1898. The resulting five-story plus basement structure is a combination of Beaux Arts and French Renaissance revival styles. It is constructed of red brick, is trimmed liberally in limestone, and has dormers covered in copper. At the top of the building is carved relief of the Greek letters . The interior included reception rooms, a billiard room, a dining room, a library, and bedrooms for twenty members. In 1996, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Delta Psi, &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;. The chapter house is also a contributing building to the Broadway-Riverside Drive National Register Historic District.

=== &quot;Delta&quot;: University of Pennsylvania ===

Regarded as the first purpose-built fraternity house on the University of Pennsylvania campus, the original Delta Psi house was a Florentine or Renaissance Revival style design by Wilson Eyre Jr. It is located at 32 South 22nd Street, across the Schuykill from Penn&#x27;s West Philadelphia campus. It opened in January 1889 and also housed the St. Anthony Club of Philadelphia. It served the fraternity from 1889 to 1908.

In 1907, Cope and Stewardson designed the chapter&#x27;s next house in the Academic Gothic style. Saint Anthony is depicted in a stained glass window in the stairway landing of the first floor; as seen in the photo to the right, a stone tau cross is also above the second-story windows on the exterior. This brick and limestone three-story house was added to National Register of Historic Places in 2005 as St. Anthony Hall House. This chapter house is described and pictured in George E. Nitzsche&#x27;s &quot;University of Pennsylvania: Its History, Traditions, Buildings, and Memorials: Also a Brief Guide to Philadelphia&quot;.

=== &quot;Upsilon&quot;: University of Virginia ===
The University of Virginia&#x27;s brick chapter house with two-story tall columns and a spacious portico was the third fraternity house constructed on Grounds—although it was the first with residential use in mind. Built in 1902, this Colonial Revival or Jeffersonian style house is &quot;beautifully situated on &#x27;Page Hill&#x27;&quot; and blends well with the campus architecture designed by Thomas Jefferson. The &quot;Upsilon chapter&quot; house was designed by J. Harleston Parker, founder of the Harleston Parker Medal. It cost $20,000 (equivalent to $ in 2023) to build. The interior was &quot;furnished with taste throughout&quot;, and included ten bedrooms, a library, a billiard room, and a reception room that was paneled in oak. There was also electric lighting, running hot and cold water, and steam heat. The house is included &quot;The Architecture of Jefferson Country: Charlottesville and Albemarle County, Virginia&quot;&quot; by K. Edward Lay.

=== &quot;Epsilon&quot;: Trinity College ===

A gift of fraternity member and recent graduate Robert Habersham Coleman, the granite lodge of the Trinity College chapter was designed in the High Victorian Gothic-style by J. Cleaveland Cady in 1878. Cady was a member of Trinity&#x27;s &quot;Epsilon chapter&quot;. This was one of the most expensive fraternity houses in America at the time and was also a &quot;radical departure from the customary tomb-like structures of the secret societies of other campuses&quot;. Added in 1985 to the National Register of Historic Places, as Saint Anthony Hall, the &quot;Epsilon chapter&quot; home is the oldest St. Anthony Hall building still in use by the fraternity. It is also the oldest fraternity house at Trinity and one of the oldest buildings on campus.

=== &quot;Kappa&quot;: Brown University ===
The &quot;Brown University chapter&quot; house at 154 Hope Street in Providence, Rhode Island, was designed by Stone, Carpenter &amp; Wilson in the Colonial Revival style in 1895. The house features ogee gables and a conservatory, as well as an addition added in 1961. Originally a private residence for Alice and Robert W. Taft, the brick building was later owned by Bryant University which called it Taft Hall and used it as its administration building from 1947 through 1969. When Brown acquired the building in 1969, it was renamed King House in 1974 in honor of Lida Shaw King, former dean of Pembroke College. Brown provides King House to the &quot;Kappa&quot; chapter as a residential student program house.

=== &quot;Lambda&quot;: Williams College ===
The former &quot;Williams College chapter&quot; house dates from 1886 and was designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead and White. White had just designed a New York City townhouse for fraternity member Frederick Ferris Thompson, who provided White to create the &quot;Lamba chapter&quot; house. The chapter house was constructed in of blue freestone and combines early Norman and Old English styles. It has been described as &quot;a witty paraphrase of a Dutch Colonial house, compact in silhouette and terminating in proud stepped gables. But no such Dutch house ever had such an audacious tower, tapered in the fashion of an Egyptian pylon.&quot; The interior has &quot;an elaborate interplay of crossbeams on the ceiling combined with heroically oversized fireplaces...&quot;

In 1905, an addition was added to the southwest end that had electricity and included nine bedrooms, a library, four studies, and three bathrooms. However, the addition was destroyed by a fire in May 1926, probably the result of faulty electrical wiring. Architect Roger Bullard and local contractors restored the wing. However, on January 21, 1927, another fire destroyed the new southwest wing, and the dining room ceiling collapsed, blowing out the windows on the first floor. Another addition was added to the south, but does not impact the main view of the house.

Because fraternities were banned at Williams in the 1960s, &quot;Lambda chapter&quot; sold its building to the college in 1970. The still-named Saint Anthony Hall now houses the college&#x27;s Center for Developmental Economics. The building was renovated and refurbished in 1996. It still includes a bronze relief memorial to fraternity member Frederick Ferris Thompson, designed in 1906 by Augustus Saint-Gaudens.

=== &quot;Sigma&quot;: Yale University ===
The original &quot;Sigma chapter&quot; house was built in 1879 and no longer exists. This five-story building was said to be &quot;the finest thing of the kind in any university in the country&quot;. In 1885, the chapter built a new house, also no longer in existence, that was designed by Harrison W. Lindsley who was a member of the &quot;Yale chapte&quot;r. It was a Richardsonian Romanesque style structure built of red sandstone. In 1894, the chapter started construction of a dormitory building designed by George Lewis Heins and Christopher Grant LaFarge of the firm Heins &amp; LaFarge. Located at 133 College Street, the dormitory housed 26 men and was named St. Anthony Hall—perhaps the first use of that name. It was built of East Haven sandstone to match the nearby chapter house and featured large parlors, a library filled with books, a porch with carved stone decorations, and servants quarters.

Around 1903, fraternity member Frederick William Vanderbilt commissioned a gift of two limestone residential halls adjacent to the chapter house. These were constructed between 1903 and 1906. Next, Vanderbilt hired Charles C. Haight to create a matching Neo-Gothic style chapter house which was completed in 1913 at 483 College Street. The ornamental iron gates from the second chapter house were re-used at the corner entrance of the new octagonal tower. It is believed that Rafael Guastavino Jr. built the domed ceiling in a basement room called The Crypt; Guastavino previously worked on Biltmore Estate for Vanderbilt&#x27;s younger brother. The Crypt &quot;has a wonderful sound parabola, where someone standing in one corner can whisper and be heard across the room by someone standing in the opposite corner&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the most expensive and elaborate secret society building in the United States&quot;.

The flanking residential halls are now part of Silliman College; St. Anthony Hall donated them to the university when Yale started a campus residential system in the 1930s.

=== &quot;Tau&quot;: Massachusetts Institute of Technology ===
The first &quot;Tau chapter&quot; house was designed by J.P. Fuller and built circa 1834–37 in the Greek Revival style. It was located at 6 Louisburg Square in Boston&#x27;s Beacon Hill neighborhood. The building also housed the St. Anthony Club of Boston. This address is the origin of the nickname for the &quot;Tau&quot; &quot;chapter&quot;—the Number Six Club. The chapter&#x27;s current multi-stored structure at 428 Memorial Drive was first occupied in 1916. It was designed by Boston architect Henry Forbes Bigelow, an alumnus of the &quot;Tau chapter&quot;.

=== St. Anthony Club of New York ===
Designed by architect S.E. Gage, the former St. Anthony Club of New York was located at 16 East 64th Street in New York City. Originally built between 1878 and 1879, Gage redesigned the building between 1902 and 1904 in the Neo-Federal style. The five-story brownstone includes limestone columns, a detailed, wrought-iron front door and gate, a limestone and marble entry foyer, and a bronze and wrought-iron main staircase. In addition, the townhouse boasted ornate moldings, high ceilings, skylights, oak Versailles parquet floors, and six wood-burning fireplaces. The building is on a historically distinguished residential street and is included in the walking tour of 64th Street.

Beginning in 1951, St. Anthony Hall used this building as an alumni city club and as headquarters for its national offices; the fraternity (Delta Psi, Inc.) purchased the building in 1952. In the early 1970s, the Barnard College Club leased space in the St. Anthony Club building. The fraternity closed its club and sold the building in 1990; the former club is now a private residence.

===Related campus buildings===
&quot;Yale chapter&quot; member and benefactor Henry Becton donated the Becton Center to Yale. Designed by Marcel Breuer, the Becton Center opened in 1970. Located at 15 Prospect Street in New Haven, the building&#x27;s most distinctive feature is an arcade of monumental tau cross-shaped concrete columns.

== Alumni groups ==

=== Foundations ===
The St. Anthony Educational Foundation Inc. is a charitable entity that supports the educational and cultural programs and activities of the fraternity through grants and scholarships to its chapters.

=== Graduate Chapter Organizations ===
St. Anthony Hall has several incorporated graduate chapter associations that exist to support its chapters and/or their buildings. The Anthony Trust association was chartered in Connecticut in 1874. Known graduate chapters include:
* 1853 Foundation, aka the Lambda Foundation (&quot;Lambda chapter&quot;)
* Anthony Trust Association of New Haven (&quot;Sigma chapter&quot;)
* &quot;Delta&quot; Alumni Association, aka Delta Psi Fraternity &quot;Delta Chapter&quot; (&quot;Delta chapter&quot;)
* St. Anthony 1907 Foundation (&quot;Delta chapter&quot;)
* St. Anthony Association of Boston (&quot;Tau chapter&quot;) 
* St. Anthony Association of North Carolina Inc., also known as St. Anthony Association (&quot;Xi chapter&quot;)
* St. Anthony Association of Virginia (&quot;Upsilon chapter&quot;)
* St. Anthony Club of Mississippi (&quot;Phi chapter&quot;)
* St. Anthony Hall of New York, Inc. (&quot;Alpha chapter&quot;)
* St. Anthony Literary Association of Princeton (&quot;Theta chapter)&quot;
* St. Anthony Trust of Hartford Inc. (&quot;Epsilon chapter&quot;)
* St. Anthony Trust of Rhode Island (&quot;Kappa chapter&quot;)

=== Clubs and area organizations ===
Historically, there were several alumni social clubs associated with the fraternity—the 1890 edition of Baird&#x27;s credits the Delta Psi with being &quot;a pioneer in the development of this form of social life&quot;. These clubs usually adopted the name St. Anthony Club because the fraternity&#x27;s badge was a St. Anthony&#x27;s cross.

==== St. Anthony Club of New York ====
Founded in 1879, the St. Anthony Club of New York was the first and longest-running of these establishments. It was also the first fraternity-related club in New York City. In 1883, it was housed at 29 East 28th Street in a building it shared with the undergraduates of the &quot;Columbia chapter&quot;.
In 1885, the club added an addition to the rear of the building, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave its readers a rare peek inside the club: 
The front room is a parlor with tables for cards. In cases on the mantlepiece are &quot;Goodwood Cups,&quot; trophies of which the club is justly proud. The furniture and fittings here are cherry, with harmonious upholstery and walls. Several fine prints are to be seen, including views of buildings of the Delta Psi at Yale, Trinity, and other colleges. A passageway, richly decorated in the baronial style of the twelfth century, leads from the office past the buffet, in a crypt under the stairs, to a large room, which, with a noble open fireplace, offers, in cosy [&quot;sic&quot;] leather cushions, in stalls in the corners and more spacious chairs, a quiet retreat. The fantastic and unique latticework of the windows attracts attention, with the bold and artistic studding of the ceiling, and ornate chandeliers especially manufactured emit their jets of gas from imitation candles...This is the smoking and lounging room. The club also included a billiard room with high oak wainscotting and walls of a blueish-green with hints of gold, an entire floor dedicated to its library, and a national fraternity office decorated with illustrations of the temptations of St. Anthony. It was also noted that the membership and dues were low, &quot;so as to prevent no one who is eligible from joining&quot;. Membership was limited to alumni of the Delta Psi fraternity, and no others could gain entry. In 1893, St. Anthony Hall was referred to by the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; as &quot;the most exclusive organization of the kind in the United States&quot;.

On July 4, 1912, the St. Anthony Club purchased the house of Edith S. Logan, widow of John A. Logan, located at 17 West 56th Street in New York City. The club used its 1879 &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; house as a partial payment to Logan. In 1929, the club purchased the Junior League&#x27;s five-story clubhouse at 133–35 61st Street, selling 17 West 56th Street in 1931. In 1936, the club and the fraternity&#x27;s office were jointly housed in a penthouse of the Berkshire Hotel at 21 East 52nd Street. The club relocated to an apartment at 270 Park Avenue in 1944. However, by the early 1980s, the club was located in a brownstone at 16 East 64th Street and was no longer financially sustainable. With the city&#x27;s property boom, by 1988 the brownstone was worth $3.5 million versus $1 million in 1984. The fraternity decided to close the club and liquidate the asset to free funds for other projects. In 1989, the fraternity borrowed money to fix structural problems and other issues with the building. The St Anthony Club of New York building sold in 1990 for $3,250,000 (equivalent to $ in 2023), although the net to the organization was significantly less because of debts, stockholder payouts, and taxes.

==== Other historic clubs ====
Known as the St. Andrews Club, the alumni group in Detroit, Michigan, started meeting annually in 1883. The St. Anthony Club in Philadelphia was established sometime before 1888 when moved into a new building with the undergraduate chapter. There was also a St. Anthony Club in Rochester, New York before 1890. The St. Anthony Club in Boston was established before 1898 and shared a building in Beacon Hill with the undergraduate chapter at MIT. The St. Anthony Club of the Northwest was organized in 1890 after having semi-annual dinner gatherings. In 1904, the St. Anthony Club of Bar Harbor, Maine gathered for its annual dinner. There was also a St. Anthony Club of Bermuda.

==== Modern clubs ====
Known modern alumni social groups include the Paris St. Anthony Hall Association, the St. Anthony Association of New Jersey, the St. Anthony Association of Nova Scotia, the St. Anthony Association of Rhode Island, the St. Anthony Association of Southern Arizona, the St. Anthony Association of Washington, D.C., and the St. Anthony Club of Philadelphia.

==Notable members==

==In popular culture==
* The exclusive Hamilton House secret society from the television show &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; was based on St. Anthony Hall&#x27;s &quot;Columbia chapter&quot;. However, when the character Van der Woodsen is denied admission to Hamilton House, she says, “It’s fine, I joined St. A’s instead.&quot;
* The &quot;St. Ray&#x27;s&quot; fraternity in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot; is modeled after the &quot;University of Pennsylvania chapter&quot; where Wolfe attended a cocktail party in 2001 while conducting research for the book.
* The cover art of rock band Vampire Weekend&#x27;s first album is of the &quot;Columbia chapter&#x27;s&quot; ballroom chandelier, taken at one of the band&#x27;s early shows.
* In June 1971, &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine featured the newly coed &quot;University of North Carolina chapter&quot; in an article called &quot;&quot;Vogue&#x27;s&quot; Eye View on Girl Power&quot;.
* The society tabloid &quot;Gawker&quot; said &quot;In the constellation of collegiate societies—fraternities, sororities, eating clubs, final clubs, and the like—few are more exclusive, and WASPy, as St. Anthony Hall, or St. A&#x27;s as it is commonly known...&quot;
* &quot;The Official Preppy Handbook&quot; says, &quot;St. A&#x27;s appeals to the &#x27;cool element&#x27; of Preppies at Yale; this means Preppies who don&#x27;t iron their shirts. It isn&#x27;t rowdy: parties there conform to the intellectual self-image Yalies hold dear.&quot;
* The &quot;University of Mississippi chapter&quot; house is said to be haunted by a brother, Jim Bridges, who died in a car wreck on the way back from a LSU football game in 1964.
* During a fellowship on campus in December 1967, California Governor Ronald Reagan was filmed by public television informally debating Yale students at St. Anthony Hall. Nancy Reagan is also present, as the Yalies quiz the governor on Vietnam and various social justice issues.
* Mama Dip (Mildred Cotton Council), an icon of Southern cooking who was a guest at the White House, once was the cook at the &quot;UNC chapter&quot;.
* During the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897, Jack London befriend two mining engineers who were members of the &quot;Yale chapter&quot;—Marshall Latham Bond and Louis Whitford Bond. They designated their cabin a chapter house, and let London camp by it for six weeks. Buck, the canine protagonist of London&#x27;s &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;, was inspired by the Bond brothers&#x27; dog. The Bond&#x27;s father, Judge Hiram Bond from California, is lightly fictionalized in &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; as Judge Miller.
* John O&#x27;Hara, in his 1960 novel &quot;Ourselves to Know&quot;, uses St. Anthony Hall membership in the characterizations of the protagonists:
** &quot;&#x27;Did you join a fraternity at Penn?&#x27; I said. &#x27;Yes I did. St Anthony–Delta Psi. But I think they were sorry that they invited me.&#x27; ...I happened to know, because I had seen it, that he had a Delta Psi Tea Company gold charm on his watch chain, but the reason he did not show it was one of delicacy; in 1908 they had not accepted his resignation but he kept the &quot;insigne&quot; hidden...&quot;
** &quot;He and Robert quickly looked at each other&#x27;s watch-chain and the Delta Psi charm and smiled.&quot;
* F. Scott Fitzgerald refers to the Pump and Slipper, an annual party at the &quot;Yale chapter&quot; since 1911, in several of his short stories:
** &quot;May Day&quot; in &quot;Tales of the Jazz Age&quot;: &quot;&#x27;My name&#x27;s Dean, Philip Dean,&#x27; he said cheerfully. &#x27;You don&#x27;t remember me, I know, but you used to come up to New Haven with a fellow I roomed with senior year, Gordon Sterrett.&#x27; Edith looked up quickly. &#x27;Yes, I went up with him twice—to the Pump and Slipper and the Junior prom.&#x27;&quot;
** &quot;Bernice Bobs Her Hair&quot;: &quot;Warren was nineteen and rather pitying with those of his friends who hadn&#x27;t gone East to college. But, like most boys, he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it. There was Genevieve Ormonde, who regularly made the rounds of dances, house-parties, and football games at Princeton, Yale, Williams, and Cornell; there was black-eyed Roberta Dillon, who was quite as famous to her generation as Hiram Johnson or Ty Cobb; and, of course, there was Marjorie Harvey, who besides having a fairylike face and a dazzling, bewildering tongue was already justly celebrated for having turned five cart-wheels in succession during the last pump-and-slipper dance at New Haven.&quot;
** &quot;A Short Trip Home&quot;, &quot;Saturday Evening Post,&quot; January 17, 1927: &quot;There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside.&quot;

== Scandals and member misconduct ==
* In 1889, a death was reported in a hazing incident at the &quot;Yale chapter&quot;. According to the news report, a pledge was placed in a coffin and lowered outside a window with a rope. When the coffin was pulled up, the pledge, who was of a &quot;nervous temperament&quot;, was found dead.
* In 1896, the fraternity revoked the charter of the University of Rochester &quot;Iota chapter&quot; without warning. At the time, &quot;Iota&quot; had existed for 44 years, had 56 members in good academic standing, owned a chapter house with a mortgage balance of just $3,000 (equivalent to $ in 2023), and had an active alumni club. The Rochester &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; concluded that the issue was with the college itself, rather than &quot;Iota chapter&quot;, writing, &quot;The fraternity is comparably small and very exclusive and desires to remain so...Rochester is not sufficiently aristocratic&quot;. The &quot;Iota Chapter&quot; did not reopen until 2010.
* In 1901, there was a kidnapping attempt of member R. H. Rogers of the &quot;Williams chapter&quot;. He was rescued from the kidnapper&#x27;s carriage by another student who had a revolver.
* On July 11, 1915, Daniel Leroy Dresser committed suicide at the &quot;Columbia chapter&quot; house over financial problems. Dresser was the brother-in-law of George Washington Vanderbilt II of Biltmore Estate.
* In October 1961, members of the &quot;University of Virginia chapter&quot; chartered an airplane to Connecticut to try and stop the &quot;Yale chapter&quot; from admitting the fraternity&#x27;s first black member, Wendell Mottley. However, Yale University warned that a fraternity showing discrimination &quot;would not be welcome on the Yale campus&quot;. Mottley became a member of St. Anthony Hall.
* In 1990, a member from the &quot;University of Pennsylvania chapter&quot; was kidnapped by members of Psi Upsilon (Castle). As a result, Castle was banned from the university.
* On January 11, 2003, the fraternity held a private black-tie dinner-dance at the Metropolitan Club of Washington, D.C. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. the $38,000 (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s money) event &quot;turned into a bacchanal&quot; with same-sex dancing, the theft of decorative items, under-aged drinking, and sexual encounters in the locker rooms. The Metropolitan Club suspended Charlie Ingersoll and Jack Shaw, the members who sponsored the event, for one month. The letter sent to Shaw and Ingersoll by the Metropolitan Club president said, &quot;The behavior was grossly inappropriate and offensive to many of the staff who worked during the event and violated the standards of our Club.&quot;
* In September 2005, the &quot;UNC chapter&quot; was charged with running &quot;a speakeasy of sorts&quot;. The fraternity&#x27;s president and the bartender were charged with selling alcohol without a State permit. However, the president was cleared of charges because the law enforcement officer failed to read her the Miranda rights.
* In 2011, St. Anthony Hall alumnus Walter Perry was convicted of embezzling $650,000 (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s money) from the &quot;Columbia chapter&quot;. He served two years in prison and was ordered to pay restitution. Perry was also expelled from the fraternity.

<text>Frederick Luke VC (29 September 1895 – 12 March 1983) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 18 years old, and a Driver in the 37th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 26 August 1914 at Le Cateau, France, when a captain (Douglas Reynolds) of the same battery was trying to save two guns which had been recaptured, Driver Luke and another driver (Job Henry Charles Drain) volunteered to help and gave great assistance in the eventual saving of one of the guns. At the time they were under heavy fire from the enemy who were only away.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant and served during World War II as a ground gunner with the Royal Air Force.

Fred Luke was a guest of honour of 93 Le cateau Field Battery shortly before his death when members of the battery were awed to meet this living legend. Gnrs Raymond Pulman and Peter Jackson formed a special guard of honour on that proud day.

For a number of years until his death on 12 March 1983, Frederick Luke was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest living holder of the Victoria Cross.

==The medal==
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1219532" wikidata="Q301336" url="?curid=1219532" title="Aarhus Convention">
<text>The UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, usually known as the Aarhus Convention, was signed on 25 June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus. It entered into force on 30 October 2001. As of March 2014, it had 47 parties—46 states and the European Union. All of the ratifying states are in Europe and Central Asia. The EU has begun applying Aarhus-type principles in its legislation, notably the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). Liechtenstein and Monaco have signed the convention but have not ratified it.

The Aarhus Convention grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice, in governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.

Interpretation of the treaty is bound by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the authoritative languages of the agreement are English, Russian and French.

== Content ==
The Aarhus Convention is a multilateral environmental agreement through which the opportunities for citizens to access environmental information are increased and transparent and reliable regulation procedure is secured. It is a way of enhancing the environmental governance network, introducing a reactive and trustworthy relationship between civil society and governments and adding the novelty of a mechanism created to empower the value of public participation in the decision-making process and guarantee access to justice: a &quot;governance-by-disclosure&quot; that leads a shift toward an environmentally responsible society. 
The Aarhus Convention was drafted by governments, with the highly required participation of NGOs, and is legally binding for all the States who ratified it becoming Parties. Among the latter is included the EC, who therefore has the task to ensure compliance not only within the member States but also for its institutions, all those bodies who carry out public administrative duties.
Each Party has the commitment to promote the principles contained in the convention and to fill out a national report, always embracing a consultative and transparent process

=== General features ===
The Aarhus Convention is a rights-based approach: the intent is for the public to have awareness of the procedures for participation in environmental decision-making, have free access to them and know how to use them.

A distinction is made between &quot;the public&quot;, all the civil society&#x27;s actors, and the &quot;public concerned&quot; precisely, those persons or organisations affected or interested in environmental decision-making (e.g. environmental NGOs).
&quot;Public authorities&quot; are the addressees of the convention, namely, governments, international institutions, and privatized bodies that have public responsibilities or act under the control of public bodies. The private sector, for which information disclosure depends on voluntary, non- mandatory practices, and bodies acting in a judicial or legislative capacity, are excluded.

Other significant provisions are the &quot;non-discrimination&quot; principle (all the information has to be provided without taking account of the nationality or citizenship of the applicant), the international nature of the convention, and the importance attributed to the promotion of environmental education of the public.

=== The Three Pillars ===
# Access to information: any citizen should have the right to get a wide and easy access to environmental information. Public authorities must provide all the information required and collect and disseminate them and in a timely and transparent manner. They can refuse to do it only under particular situations (such as national defence);
# Public participation in decision making: the public must be informed over all the relevant projects and it has to have the chance to participate during the decision-making and legislative process. Decision makers can take advantage from people&#x27;s knowledge and expertise; this contribution is a strong opportunity to improve the quality of the environmental decisions, outcomes and to guarantee procedural legitimacy
# Access to justice: the public has the right to judicial or administrative recourse procedures in case a Party violates or fails to adhere to environmental law and the convention&#x27;s principles.

=== Further reflections ===
The Aarhus convention is a &quot;proceduralisation of the environmental regulation&quot;, it focuses more on setting and listing procedures rather than establishing standards and specifying outcomes, permitting the parties involved to interpret and implement the convention on the systems and circumstances that characterize their nation. This model embodies a perfect example of a multi-level governance.

The risk could lay in a loss of time and resources that could be otherwise invested in defining the outcomes, notwithstanding the fact that it renders the convention vague, weak and open to multiple interpretations.
Other critiques note the fact that private bodies are excluded from the mandatory procedures (Mason, 2010), and that, moreover, it can also be debated whether the NGOs involved are faithfully representing environmental interests, ordinary citizens often do not have the financial means to participate effectively and are therefore have no choice but to be represented by these larger organisations. The relative differences between the participants and social groups&#x27; resource inequalities also suggests the possibility for irregular and imbalanced environmental protection.

=== Compliance Committee ===
The Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee was established to fulfill the requirement of Article 15 of the convention on review of compliance to establish arrangements for reviewing compliance with the convention.
The convention has a unique Compliance Review Mechanism, which can be triggered in four ways: 
# a Party makes a submission concerning its own compliance,
# a Party makes a submission concerning another Party&#x27;s compliance,
# the Convention Secretariat makes a referral to the committee, or
# a member of the public makes a communication concerning the compliance of a Party.
The Compliance mechanism is unique in international environmental law, as it allows members of the public to communicate concerns about a Party&#x27;s compliance directly to a committee of international legal experts empowered to examine the merits of the case (the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee). Nonetheless, the Compliance Committee cannot issue binding decisions, but rather makes recommendations to the full Meeting of the Parties (MoP). However, in practice, as MoPs occur infrequently, Parties attempt to comply with the recommendations of the Compliance Committee. As of August 2009, 41 communication from the public – many originating with non-governmental organizations – and one submission from a Party had been lodged with the convention&#x27;s Compliance Committee.

=== Pollutant Release Protocol ===
The Kyiv Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers to the Aarhus Convention was adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the Parties on 21 May 2003, in Kyiv, Ukraine. 36 states and the European Community signed the Protocol. As of July 2023, 38 parties had ratified the Protocol.

The Kyiv Protocol is the first legally binding international instrument on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs). PRTRs are inventories of pollution from industrial sites and other sources such as agriculture and transport. The objective of the Protocol is &quot;to enhance public access to information through the establishment of coherent, nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs).&quot; The Protocol places indirect obligations on private enterprises to report annually to their national governments on their releases and transfers of pollutants.

Parties to the Protocol need not be parties to the convention. The Protocol is in this sense a free-standing, international agreement. The Kyiv Protocol on PRTRs will enter into force 90 days after the sixteenth State ratifies or accedes to the agreement.

=== Genetically Modificed Organisms amendment ===
An amendment to the Aarhus Convention on &quot;Public Participation in Decisions on Deliberate Release into the Environment and Placing on the Market of Genetically Modified Organisms&quot; was adopted at the Second Meeting of the Parties on 27 May 2005, in Almaty, Kazakhstan. As of July 2023, it had been ratified by 32 countries; the GMO amendment required one further ratification to enter into force.

== Reception, influence and implementation ==
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in 2000, &quot;Although regional in scope, the significance of the Aarhus Convention is global. It is by far the most impressive elaboration of principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, which stresses the need for citizens&#x27; participation in environmental issues and for access to information on the environment held by public authorities. As such it is the most ambitious venture in the area of environmental democracy so far undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations.&quot;

The influence of the Aarhus Convention extends beyond the environmental field. At the 2nd Internet Governance Forum, held on 12–15 May 2007, in Rio de Janeiro, the convention was presented as a model of public participation and transparency in the operation of international forums.

In the United Kingdom, the Convention is implemented through the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, which implements EU Directive 2003/4/EC. Following the UK&#x27;s departure from the European Union, the Regulations continue to be binding through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and the UK is a signatory in its own right. In part due to a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union and domestic litigation, a special costs regime applies in England and Wales when bringing judicial review claims under the Aarhus Convention. The special costs regime does &quot;not&quot; apply to statutory claims, and the Court of Appeal has rejected litigation seeking to extend it to such claims.

<doc id="1219535" wikidata="Q1013970" url="?curid=1219535" title="Heywood, Greater Manchester">
<text>Heywood is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, in the historic county of Lancashire. It had a population of 28,205 at the 2011 Census. The town lies on the south bank of the River Roch, east of Bury, southwest of Rochdale, and north of Manchester. Middleton lies to the south, whilst to the north is the Cheesden Valley, open moorland, and the Pennines.

The Anglo-Saxons cleared the densely wooded area, dividing it into heys or fenced clearings. In the Middle Ages, Heywood formed a chapelry in the township, around Heywood Hall, a manor house owned by a family with that surname. Farming was the main industry of a sparsely populated rural area. The population supplemented their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.

The factory system in the town can be traced to a spinning mill in the late 18th century. Following the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, Heywood developed into a mill town and coal mining district. A period of &quot;extraordinary growth of the cotton-trade&quot; in the mid 19th century was so quick and profound that there was &quot;an influx of strangers causing a very dense population&quot;. The town became a municipal borough in 1881. Imports of foreign cotton goods in the mid-20th century precipitated the decline of Heywood&#x27;s textile and mining industries, resulting in a more diverse industrial base. The town was well respected for the quality of its cotton goods. The Queen Mother once visited Heywood in the very early 1900s to admire the cotton in its factories. Cotton from Heywood cotton mills was used to create the dress that she wore for her 50th birthday celebration speech.

Heywood is close to junction 19 of the M62 motorway, which provides transport links for the large distribution parks in the south of the town. The 1860s-built tall Parish Church of St Luke the Evangelist dominates the town centre and skyline. Heywood was the birthplace of Peter Heywood, the magistrate who aided the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, whose family seat was Heywood Hall. Heywood has a station on the East Lancashire heritage railway.

==History==
Evidence attests that human activity in the area extends back to the Mesolithic period; flints have been found in Heywood, in the Cheesden Valley and Knowl Moor areas. Artefacts from the Roman period and Bronze Age have been discovered. A Bronze Age cairn high and in diameter was discovered in the 1960s. Excavations by the Bury Archaeological Group revealed beakers associated with human burials. The name Heywood is believed to derive from the Old English word &quot;haga&quot;, meaning hedge or animal-enclosure. In the 12th century, Heywood was recorded as a hamlet in the township of Heap.

A family surnamed Heywood can be traced back to the 11th century, and in 1286, Adam de Bury granted the land of Heywood to Peter of Heywood. Heywood Hall, the administrative centre of the manor and the seat of the Heywood family, was built in the 13th century. A member of the family and a resident of Heywood Hall was Peter Heywood, the magistrate who, with a party of men, arrested Guy Fawkes during the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Another member of the family, also called Peter Heywood, was aboard HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; when its crew mutinied in 1789.

During the Middle Ages the area was thinly populated and consisted of several hamlets. Apart from the Heywoods of Heywood Hall, the sparse population of Heywood comprised a small community of farmers, most of whom were involved with pasture but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens and fustians in the domestic system. During the Early Modern period, the weavers of Heywood had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers&#x27; cottages, but as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the early 18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger and more efficient equipment became apparent. Industrial textile manufacture was introduced in the town in the late 18th century and the first spinning mill – Makin Mill – was built at Wrigley Brook (later known as Queens Park Road). By 1780 there remained less than 100 hand-loom fustian weavers out of a population of 2,000 and industrialist Sir Robert Peel (father of Prime Minister Robert Peel) converted Makin Mill for cotton production. This initiated a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the area and the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The cotton trade in Heywood grew, and by 1833 there were 27 cotton mills.

What was described as a period of &quot;extraordinary growth of the cotton-trade&quot; in the mid-19th century, led to &quot;an influx of strangers causing a very dense population&quot;. Urbanisation caused by the expansion of factories and housing meant that in 1885, Rochdale-born poet Edwin Waugh, was able to describe Heywood as &quot;almost entirely the creation of the cotton industry&quot;.

In 1905 Plum Tickle Mill began operation as the largest mule-spinning mill in the world under one roof, however, Plum Mill and its sister-mill, Unity Mill, were idled in the 1960s under the government reorganisation of the cotton industry. The last large weaving mill in the town was J. Smith, Hargreaves &amp; Company, towel manufacturers. However this mill was also idled in the 1980s and operations were transferred to W.T. Taylor &amp; Company in Horwich.

Most of the cotton mills have now been demolished, mainly to make way for housing. One of the last mills remaining, though not in production since 1986, has recently been offered for redevelopment as flats. The &quot;Mutual Mills&quot;, a complex of four, are Grade II listed buildings.

The town also has a history of coal mining. Coal pits were opened in Hooley Clough in the early 19th century by the Lord of the Manor of Rochdale. During the 19th century a colliery at Captain Fold was run by the Heywood Coal Company. Two people were killed at Captain Fold Colliery between 1844 and 1848. When the mine flooded in 1852 two more people were killed and the colliery closed soon after. Mining continued in the town with drift mining in Bamford until 1950.

In 1881, the newly created Municipal Borough of Heywood included 67 cotton mills and weaving sheds, 67 machine works and other workshops, 75 cotton waste and other warehouses and 5,877 dwelling houses. It had 22 churches and chapels and 24 Sunday and day schools. The population was estimated at 25,000.

The town was originally served by railway, with Heywood railway station to the south of the town. There were services to Bury Knowsley Street railway station and Rochdale, but this line was closed in the 1970s. However, the line has recently been re-opened to Bury, as an extension to the East Lancashire Railway preservation project.

The town had its own canal, the Heywood Branch Canal which is now infilled and largely gone.

There is a local legend that men from Heywood used to have tails and that public houses had holes in their benches for tails to fit through. The legend led to the town developing the nickname of &quot;Monkey Town&quot;. A more prosaic explanation is that in the 19th Century, the town was based around Heap Bridge, now barely a suburb of the town, when, in the accent (of the locals) and Irish &quot;Navvies&quot; working on the railway, the town was &#x27;Ape bridge.

In the 20th century, the town&#x27;s cotton mills went into steep decline, only Glossop in Derbyshire went into sharper recession; in contrast, the spinning capacity of nearby Rochdale shrank more slowly than any other mill town apart from Wigan.

The southern wing of St Luke&#x27;s Church, well known throughout the area for its beautiful proportions and ornate carvings, is suggested to have been one of Hitler&#x27;s high-priority items for acquisition had he won the war.

In 2007 plans were announced to shake off an area&#x27;s &#x27;mill town&#x27; image and rejuvenate the town over a 10–15-year period to appeal to a younger generation. The plan involves creating new retail, business and community spaces, demolishing 300 flats and houses and replacing them with 1,000 new homes.

Heywood Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1905. The club disappeared at the time of World War Two.

==Governance==

===Civic history===

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Heywood during the Middle Ages constituted a chapelry in the township of Heap, parish of Bury, and hundred of Salford. The Heywood family, who had their seat at Heywood Hall, exercised considerable political power throughout the Middle Ages on the locale.

Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Heywood formed part of the Bury Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security. Heywood&#x27;s first local authority was a Local board of health established in 1864; Heap Middle Division Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the Heywood part of Heap township. In 1867 the local board was reconstituted as the Heywood Local Board of Health which covered the whole of Heap township and parts of Hopwood, Birtle-with-Bamford, Pilsworth and Castleton townships. In 1879 further parts of Hopwood and Pilsworth townships were added to the area under the local board. It was not recognised as a borough in the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, but on 18 February 1881 the area of the local board was granted borough status and became the Municipal Borough of Heywood. Following the Local Government Act 1894 (which formally dissolved all townships) the municipal borough became a local government district of the administrative county of Lancashire. The borough council was based out of Heywood&#x27;s Municipal Buildings. In 1900 a part of Castleton Urban District was added to Heywood, and in 1933 part of the Heywood borough was transferred to the County Borough of Bury, whilst in exchange, parts of Norden Urban District and Birtle-with-Bamford and Unsworth civil parishes were added to Heywood. In 1967, the Borough of Heywood twinned with Peine in Germany.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Heywood was abolished, and Heywood has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Municipal Buildings, which served as the former town hall, were demolished in the mid-1980s. Since 1992, Heywood has been one of four township committee areas of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. The Heywood Township Committee meets six times per year, with the vision of making Heywood &quot;a safe, small town set in attractive countryside ... part of a successful borough and city region&quot;. Each meeting commences with an open forum session, which gives local residents the opportunity to ask questions of their local members or to raise issues of local concern.

===Parliamentary representation===
In terms of parliamentary representation, Heywood after the Reform Act 1832 was represented as part of the South Lancashire constituency, of which the first Members of Parliaments (MPs) were the Liberals George William Wood and Charles Molyneux. Constituency boundaries changed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and Heywood has lain within the South East Lancashire (1868–1885), Heywood (1885–1918), Heywood and Radcliffe (1918–1950), and Heywood and Royton (1950–1983) constituencies. Since 1983, Heywood has lain within Heywood and Middleton. It was represented in the House of Commons by Liz McInnes, a member of the Labour Party from 2014 to 2019. At the 2019 general election, McInnes was defeated by Conservative candidate, Chris Clarkson.

==Geography==


Located north-northwest of central London, Heywood lies south of the Pennines, on the south bank of the River Roch. The larger towns of Bury, Middleton and Rochdale lie to the west, south and northeast respectively. For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Heywood forms part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, with Manchester city centre itself south of Heywood.

At the north of Heywood, the River Roch meanders westerly into Bury, and then onwards to Radcliffe where it unites its waters with the River Irwell. The general slope of the land in Heywood increases in height away from the Roch. From the north bank of the Roch is the Roch Valley and Cheesden Valley. The Cheesden Valley is a wooded river valley of the Cheesden Brook, flanked on all sides by high moorland and small hamlets, like Birtle. The soil is sandy, and the subsoil is clay.

Heywood&#x27;s built environment follows a standard urban structure, consisting of residential dwellings centred around Market Street in the town centre, which is the local centre of commerce. There is a mixture of low-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Heywood, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is residential. Heywood is surrounded on all sides by Green Belt, variously consisting of wooded river valleys and high moorland in the north, and flat farmland in the south.

Suburban localities in Heywood include Broadfield, Captain Fold, Crimble, Darnhill and Hopwood. Hopwood was formerly a township of itself, but was amalgamated into Heywood in the 19th century. Darnhill is the site of a planned overspill council estate, built in the 1950s and 1960s as part of a slum clearance project throughout inner-city Manchester. Heywood&#x27;s population increased when thousands of people were moved out of Manchester&#x27;s slums and into what was then the Heywood countryside of Darnhill.

==Demography==
According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Heywood had a population of 28,024. The 2001 population density was 11,338 per mi2 (4,378 per km2), with a 100 to 94.3 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 30.3% were single (never married) and 39.7% married. Heywood&#x27;s 11,724 households included 31.2% one-person, 34.6% married couples living together, 10.5% were co-habiting couples, and 12.6% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 38.3% had no academic qualifications.

At the 2001 UK census, 80.6% of Heywood&#x27;s residents reported themselves as being Christian, 1.1% Muslim, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Buddhist and 0.1% Jewish. The census recorded 9.9% as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 8.0% did not state their religion.

Heywood&#x27;s population remained constant for most of the 20th century, but increased from 24,090 in 1960 to 30,443 in 1970, following the opening of the Darnhill overspill council estate, which transferred thousands of people from inner-city Manchester, to Heywood. The first families to move to Heywood from Manchester as part of the slum clearances came in 1963.

==Economy==

From the 18th century onwards, Heywood&#x27;s economy was closely tied with that of Britain&#x27;s textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the cotton spinning sector. Since deindustrialisation in the 20th century, Heywood&#x27;s economic activity has been focused around Heywood town centre, and the Heywood Distribution Park, one of the UK&#x27;s largest single-owned industrial parks. Heywood town centre lies at the convergence of Heywood&#x27;s Market Street and York Street. Heywood Market Hall on York Street, offers a variety of stalls and small retail outlets. Heywood Distribution Park lies in the south of the town, in Pilsworth, and spans over . It is part of Segro, a property investment and development company with real estate investment trust status. Heywood Distribution was sold to Segro (then Slough Estates) for £276M, and was one of a number of properties in Greater Manchester that Slough Estates described as &quot;important strategic sites, and provide prime industrial property with high-calibre occupiers as well as development land&quot;. It is the largest single-owned distribution park in the region, and has won 16 awards for security. Companies with property in the park include Character Options, Eddie Stobart, Argos, and Shop Direct Group.

The whole town is undergoing a major regeneration as part of the government&#x27;s New Deal for Communities, and New Heart for Heywood are investing around £52 million. The scheme is designed to renew deprived areas. This bid was initially won in 2000 and work to regenerate this town is still ongoing. Some of the planned works for 2006–08 included a new health connections centre, a new family surestart centre, a new primary school (although several are being knocked down as a result) and a multimillion-pound sports and leisure village.

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents aged 16–74 was 24.6% retail and wholesale, 19.2% manufacturing, 10.7% health and social work, 5.5% education, 8.2% transport and communications, 8.1% property and business services, 7.9% construction, 4.2% public administration, 3.8% hotels and restaurants, 3.0% finance, 0.7% energy and water supply, 0.4% agriculture, 0.1 mining and 3.6% other. Compared with national figures, the town had a relatively low percentage working in agriculture. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 1.9% students were with jobs, 3.3% students without jobs, 5.6% looking after home or family, 8.5% permanently sick or disabled, economically inactive for other reasons.
The &quot;Heywood Advertiser&quot; was founded in the 19th century. The newspaper has a readership of 16,500 and runs its own website.

==Landmarks==

Historically, Heywood&#x27;s only landmark was Heywood Hall, the town&#x27;s former manor house which was inhabited by the Heywood family. On Heywood in 1881, Edwin Waugh said:

The parish church of St Luke the Evangelist is Heywood&#x27;s major landmark – the focal point of the town centre. A place of worship at the site of St Luke&#x27;s is known to have existed prior to 1611. The church started life as a chantry chapel for the Heywood family. The Old Heywood Chapel was demolished in 1859 to make way for the present church, built to the designs of Joseph Clarke. The foundation stone was laid on 31 May 1860, and the building was completed in 1862 using stone from Yorkshire and ashlar from Staffordshire and Bath. St Luke&#x27;s was consecrated on 8 October 1862 following a public subscription appeal, and dedicated to Luke the Evangelist. The tower and spire is detached from the main church building and stands high, dominating Heywood&#x27;s centre and townscape.

Heywood War Memorial lies in Memorial Gardens opposite the Parish Church of St Luke the Evangelist, and was originally erected &quot;to the men of Heywood who gave their lives&quot; during the First World War, but later, the Second World War. It is a grey granite cenotaph decorated with wreaths and crosses. At the front is a bronze female figure holding a laurel wreath to symbolise peace. It was sculpted by Walter Marsden. Heywood War Memorial was commissioned by the Heywood War Memorial Committee and unveiled on 22 August 1925 by Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Manchester. The roll of honour was not engraved on the memorial at the time of its unveiling owing to a lack of funds. Lobbying by the Heywood branch of the Royal British Legion secured a grant from Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council to cover the £5,000 required; names from both world wars were engraved in 1986.

Ashworth Valley is a renowned local beauty spot. Queens Park re-opened in 2006 after a multimillion-pound facelift, with many of its Victorian attractions restored, including the old fountain and many of the statues.

==Transport==

Public transport in Heywood is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Bus services include the 471 to Bolton, Bury, and Rochdale and the 163 to Bury, Darn Hill, Middleton and Manchester, as well as other local services, mainly operated by First Greater Manchester and Rosso. Major A roads link Heywood with other settlements. The M62 motorway passes to the south and can be accessed at Junction 19.

Heywood railway station is on the East Lancashire Railway, a heritage railway which connects Heywood with Rawtenstall railway station via Ramsbottom railway station. The original station opened on the national rail network in 1841 and closed in 1970. It re-opened in 2003 as an extension of the East Lancashire Railway from Bury Bolton Street railway station.

==Education==

Heywood Technical School was opened on 1 December 1894, on a site then known as the Market Ground. The building, which had technical school status, also contained an art school. The school was doubled in size eighteen years later and opened as the Heywood Day Secondary School. It was renamed 12 years after that as Heywood Grammar School. In 2010 Heywood Community High School closed despite being found outstanding in many areas by Ofsted and being one of the country&#x27;s most improved schools.

<text>The Imaginatively Titled Punt &amp; Dennis Show, known simply as Punt and Dennis throughout its second series, is a British stand-up and sketch show written by and starring comedians Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. The first series of 6 episodes was broadcast between 7 July and 11 August 1994.

The second series, also of 6 episodes, was broadcast on Fridays at 20:30 (episodes 1 and 2) and 20:00 (episodes 3, 4 and 5) between 28 July and 1 September 1995, except for the last episode which was broadcast on Thursday 7 September at 22:45 (there was no episode shown on 11 August 1995).

==Overview==
The two had already appeared as a double act in &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; and &quot;Canned Carrott&quot;.

Impressionists Alistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona were among the guests on the show.

There were several character inventions in the sketches, such as &quot;The Gullibles&quot;, who were always falling for scams, as well as a number of Punt and Dennis&#x27;s characters from &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, such as the milk-obsessed &quot;Mr Strange&quot;. There were also spoofs from TV programmes such as &quot;Baywatch&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

The second series also featured performances by tribute bands; these included Björn Again in episode 1; The Bootleg Beatles in episode 2; The Counterfeit Stones in episode 3; The LA Doors in episode 4; The Royal Family (a Queen tribute band) in episode 5; and T.Rextasy (a T. Rex tribute band) in episode 6.

==Characters==
The show featured a mix of stand-up, spoofs of known television series, but also a number of character based sketches. These characters and sketches included:

* Mr Strange a man obsessed with milk and disgusting things to do with it. He briefly informs the audience of his latest &#x27;experiment&#x27; and usually signs off with his catchphrase &quot;milky-milky&quot;. (played by Hugh Dennis)
* Norris Employed by the BBC as a weatherman as part of a home-office scheme to help rehabilitate habitual criminals, Norris&#x27; forecasts feature advice to take advantage of specific weather conditions to break into people&#x27;s homes and &quot;get yourself something nice!&quot;. (Hugh Dennis, Series 2)
* Kurt Wenker a living stereotype of the buff, tanned, German guy in charge of handing out the windsurf boards in holiday destinations. Kurt constantly intimidates British male tourists and jokes about stealing their girlfriends. (Hugh Dennis)
* World of Wine and World of Whisky. A programme presented by a man called Tarquin (Punt) and alcoholic wine connoisseur Michael (Dennis). Tarquin attempts to maintain the pomp and circumstance of presenting a professional programme about wines and spirits while Michael, slurs his way through viewers Q&amp;A sessions criticising their attempts to do anything with wine other than drink it.
* Update With Tony Shannon and Ian Pye News anchors Tony Shannon (Dennis) and Ian Pye (Punt), who constantly introduce each other and the news headlines without ever actually reading any news.
* The Rt. Hon. Hector Sleazely MP A member of parliament who is constantly in the middle of a scandal and attempts to explain himself in a statement to reporters. The statement is laced with word play, mostly homonyms, to the point where the long speech is generally meaningless. Sleazely always ends with his insistence that he will not be resigning before awkwardly resigning from making the statement. (Hugh Dennis)
*Do you Fancy a Bit of a Brew? A lazy, dishonest tradesman (Dennis) who is always caught having a cup of tea, mainly because that is all he does. Any building work he does is usually shoddy and dangerous.
*Any Way you Want It Two sketches (the first is in a fast food restaurant, the other in a garage) featuring the same two characters, one of whom (Gary - Dennis) is not very bright. These two characters first appeared in &quot;Canned Carrott&quot;.
*The Jockeys Two jockeys sitting in a pub either discussing their races as racing commentators would (i.e. rather quickly), or referring to pint-sized personalities like Prince or Ronnie Corbett as &#x27;big men&#x27; - referring to the fact that jockeys are typically very short people.
*Martin An alcoholic, chain-smoking hit-man (Dennis) who been asked to do one last job supposedly to take out an assassin (McGowan), but has actually been duped by Dane (Punt) as he is incompetent and supposedly bound to get the job wrong.
*Embarrassing Dad A father (Dennis) embarrasses his children by tactlessly telling one of his daughter&#x27;s teachers that she fancies him, or ordering food in McDonald&#x27;s and eating the packaging only to make matters worse by saying &#x27;No-one&#x27;s watching!&#x27;. Also appeared in the Mary Whitehouse Experience constantly gatecrashing a party and saying that what ever is being played on the stereo &#x27;has a good beat&#x27; when it isn&#x27;t necessarily music.

<text>The Ian Gillan Band were an English progressive jazz-rock band formed by singer Ian Gillan of Deep Purple in 1975. Their sound is a departure from the heavy metal of Deep Purple by featuring a progressive jazz fusion sound, more similar to bands such as Brand X.

==History==
After leaving Deep Purple in June 1973, Ian Gillan had retired from the music business to pursue other business ventures, including motorcycle engines, a country hotel / restaurant (with a guitar shaped swimming pool), and ownership of the Kingsway Recorders studio, where from April 1974 he began to work on his first post-Deep Purple solo tracks.
These ventures, apart from the recording studio, all ended in failure. This fact, combined with a warm reception to his guest appearance at Roger Glover&#x27;s Butterfly Ball live show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 16 October 1975 (he sang &quot;Sitting in a Dream&quot; as a substitute for Ronnie James Dio, who was banned by Ritchie Blackmore to take part in it) prompted him to resume a singing career and form a new band.

Initially called Shand Grenade, a combination of Shangri-la and Grenade, Gillan was persuaded by the management to change the band&#x27;s name to the Ian Gillan Band. He recruited guitarist Ray Fenwick, bass player John Gustafson, keyboard player Mike Moran and Elf percussionist Mark Nauseef on drums. Using Roger Glover as producer and session musician, this line-up recorded their first album &quot;Child In Time&quot; in December 1975 / January 1976. In February 1976 Moran was replaced by Mickey Lee Soule (ex-Elf and Rainbow), but for the recording of follow-up album &quot;Clear Air Turbulence&quot; he was dropped in May 1976 in favour of Colin Towns.

The band had some success in Japan but none at all in North America and only cult status in Europe, their jazz fusion direction unappealing to pop and rock fans alike. Their first album, &quot;Child In Time&quot;, reached 55 on the UK charts and 36 in Sweden. Their third album, &quot;Scarabus&quot; (1977), had more of a rock sound but retained the jazz fusion direction. Released at the height of punk rock, there was no success beyond Japan and their label Island Records dropped them.

The following year Gillan dissolved the band but retained Colin Towns and formed a new band called simply Gillan. A live album was released after the breakup. John Gustafson said: &quot;Gillan decided he didn’t like the band’s direction and wanted to do more rock stuff. In reality, he should have put his foot down a lot earlier. I personally was expecting Deep Purple stuff, but he let us do whatever we wanted.&quot;

<text>The 1977 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1977 season. The 74th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees defeated the Dodgers four games to two to win the franchise&#x27;s 21st World Series championship, their first since 1962, and the first under the ownership of George Steinbrenner (who assumed ownership of the club in 1973). Played from October 11 to 18, the Series was televised on ABC.

During this Series, Reggie Jackson earned his nickname &quot;Mr. October&quot; for his heroics. Billy Martin won what would be his only World Series title as a manager after guiding the Yankees to a second straight pennant.

==Route to the series==
===New York Yankees===
The New York Yankees returned to the World Series after being swept by the Cincinnati Reds the previous year. In free agency, the Yankees signed slugging right fielder Reggie Jackson for US$2.96 million ($ in current dollar terms) over five years and Cincinnati Reds ace pitcher Don Gullett for $2 million ($ in current dollar terms) over six years. Two other key players were acquired by the Yankees through trades. Shortstop Bucky Dent was picked up from the Chicago White Sox for outfielder Oscar Gamble, pitcher LaMarr Hoyt, and $200,000. After only one year with the Oakland Athletics, pitcher Mike Torrez was acquired in exchange for pitcher Dock Ellis and utilitymen Marty Perez and Larry Murray.

After a lackluster first half, the Yankees finished strong, winning 38 of their last 51 games, edging both the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles by games. Among the star-laden lineup was an emerging superstar, Ron Guidry. Early in the season Guidry was moved from the bullpen into the starting rotation, finishing 16–7 with a 2.82 ERA. The Yankees advanced to the World Series after beating the Kansas City Royals in an exciting fifth and final 1977 American League Championship Series (ALCS) game, winning it with three runs in the top of the ninth on a string of singles and a costly error by George Brett.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

The National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers were managed by Tommy Lasorda, who was in his first full season as manager. The 1977 Dodgers became the first team to have four players hit 30 or more home runs in one season, as Steve Garvey hit 33, Reggie Smith hit 32, Ron Cey hit 30, and Dusty Baker hit 30. The pitching staff, which led the National League in ERA, 3.22, were led by 20-game winner Tommy John and closer Charlie Hough with 22 saves. The Dodgers won 22 of their first 26 games, winning the Western Division by 10 games over the Cincinnati Reds, then eliminated the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1977 National League Championship Series (NLCS) in four games.

===Series preview===
The matchup of the Yankees and the Dodgers harkened back to the &quot;Subway Series&quot; matchups between the two teams of the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams had met in eight previous World Series, with the Yankees winning in 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, and 1956 and the Dodgers in 1955 and 1963. The 1963 series was their first meeting after the Dodgers had moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958.

This was the first World Series in which the ceremonial first pitches were from the mound instead of from the Commissioner&#x27;s box, although this did not become permanent until 1989.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
The Dodgers scored twice in the top of the first inning, when Davey Lopes walked and scored on a Bill Russell triple off Don Gullett. Ron Cey made it 2–0 on a sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees responded with consecutive two-out singles by Thurman Munson, Reggie Jackson, and Chris Chambliss, scoring Munson.

In the top of the sixth inning, Steve Garvey beat out a bunt and, with two out, attempted to score from first on a hit-and-run single to center field by Glenn Burke. Mickey Rivers, who did not possess a strong throwing arm, threw home. Replays showed Garvey clearly beat the tag but he was called out at the plate. The Yankees tied it in their half of the sixth inning when Willie Randolph hit a home run off Don Sutton.

The Yankees took the lead in the eighth inning when Munson doubled home Randolph. Later in the inning, the Yankees loaded the bases with one out, but Dodger reliever Elías Sosa struck out Lou Piniella and retired Bucky Dent on a forceout to end the threat.

The Dodgers tied it at 3–3 in the ninth inning Dusty Baker led off with a single and was almost picked off first when pinch-hitter Manny Mota failed on a bunt attempt. Mota flied out, but Steve Yeager walked and pinch-hitter Lee Lacy drove Baker home with a single.

In extra innings, the Yankees got their leadoff hitters on in both the tenth and eleventh innings but did not score due to failure to lay down sacrifice bunts. Finally, in the 12th, Randolph led off and doubled and Munson was walked intentionally. Yankee manager Billy Martin at first wanted Paul Blair, the next hitter, to try to sacrifice again, but after two failed attempts, Martin had Blair hit away and Blair singled home Randolph with the game-winner.

1977 AL Cy Young award winner Sparky Lyle took the win in Game 1 and, coupled with his wins in Games 4 and 5 of the 1977 ALCS, is the only pitcher to win three consecutive decisions in a single postseason.

===Game 2===
With aces Ron Guidry and Mike Torrez having both pitched in Game 5 of the ALCS, Billy Martin was forced to use a sore-shouldered Catfish Hunter in Game 2. The Dodgers hit three homers in the first three innings off Hunter, as Ron Cey hit a two-run home run in the first, Steve Yeager a home run in the second, and Reggie Smith a two-run home run in the third. Steve Garvey hit a home run in the ninth off of Sparky Lyle. Burt Hooton pitched a five-hit complete game, allowing only run one in the fourth on Reggie Jackson&#x27;s ground ball double play after Willie Randolph and Thurman Munson led off the inning with back-to-back singles. Hooton made amends for his meltdown in Game 3 of the 1977 NLCS.

About an hour before the first pitch, a fire had started in Public School 3, an abandoned elementary school a few blocks east of Yankee Stadium. During the game, ABC cut to a helicopter camera for an overhead view of Yankee Stadium and the surrounding neighborhood, catching the fire.

===Game 3===
The Yankees struck for three runs in the first off Tommy John. Mickey Rivers led off with a bloop double to right (his first hit of the series) and scored on a harder-hit Thurman Munson double to right. Reggie Jackson singled to left to score Munson and went to second when Dodger left fielder Dusty Baker overran the ball. Lou Piniella then scored Jackson on an RBI single up the middle to make it 3–0.

Baker atoned for his first-inning error by hitting a three-run homer in the third off Yankee starter Mike Torrez. The Yankees regained the lead with single runs in the fourth and fifth on an RBI groundout by Rivers, who finished the game with three hits (including two doubles), and an RBI single by Chris Chambliss. Torrez then shut out the Dodgers for the rest of the way. Torrez finished with nine strikeouts in the complete-game win.

Before the game, a moment of silence was held in memory of entertainer and former Pittsburgh Pirates co-owner Bing Crosby, who died earlier that day.

==== National anthem ====
Before the game, Linda Ronstadt sang the national anthem, standing alone in center field wearing jeans and a Dodgers warmup jacket. The attire drew much media attention afterwards. The performance itself was later ranked by the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; as the second-best national anthem rendition at a sporting event; according to the magazine, &quot;it was such a hit Ronstadt wore a similar satin jacket — along with short shorts, kneepads and roller skates — on the cover of her 1978 album, &quot;Living in the USA&quot;.&quot;

===Game 4===
With Don Sutton needing another day of rest, Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda started left-hander Doug Rau to counter the Yankees&#x27; left-handed power. Rau was rusty, having only pitched in relief in one game of the 1977 NLCS. After a relatively easy first inning, Reggie Jackson hit a leadoff double in the second. Lou Piniella singled Jackson home with the first run and was doubled to third by Chris Chambliss. Lasorda then pulled Rau in favor of Rick Rhoden, resulting in a heated argument between Lasorda and Rau on the mound. At that point, Rau had given up four hits, including three to left-handed hitters. The Yankees scored two more runs in the inning on an RBI groundout by Graig Nettles and an RBI single by Bucky Dent.

The Dodgers scored twice in the third. Rhoden, a good hitting pitcher, hit a ground-rule double to left, and Davey Lopes followed with a two-run homer off Yankee starter Ron Guidry. The Dodgers scored nothing else off Guidry, as he pitched a four-hit complete game.

The Dodgers almost tied the game in the fourth when Ron Cey sent a drive to deep left that Lou Piniella leaped up and caught. Jackson ended the scoring with an opposite-field home run off Rhoden in the sixth inning.

===Game 5===
The Dodgers needed a win to send the Series back to New York. Davey Lopes led off the first with a triple and came home when Bill Russell singled. In the fourth, the Dodgers had an RBI single by Dusty Baker and a three-run homer by Steve Yeager. Baker added another RBI single in the fifth, Lee Lacy singled home a run, and Yeager batted in another run with a sacrifice fly. Reggie Smith completed the scoring with a two-run homer in the sixth inning.

The Yankees scored two runs each in the seventh and eighth; the two runs in the eighth coming on back-to-back homers by Thurman Munson and Reggie Jackson. Nevertheless, Dodger starting pitcher Don Sutton pitched a complete game for the win.

===Game 6===
Game 6 shifted the series back to New York, where 56,407 filled Yankee Stadium.

After two infield ground outs by Davey Lopes and Bill Russell, Steve Garvey put the Dodgers on the board with a two-run triple down the right field line off Mike Torrez, scoring Reggie Smith and Ron Cey; both runs were unearned after shortstop Bucky Dent booted Smith&#x27;s ground ball and Cey walked. New York tied it in the second as Chris Chambliss lifted a 2–1 pitch from starter Burt Hooton into the right center seats after Reggie Jackson walked on four pitches, but the next three batters went down in order. After Lopes and Russell grounded out again in the top of the third, Smith put Los Angeles up 3–2 with his third homer of the Series, pounding a 1–1 pitch well into the right center seats. Cey lined an infield hit to third, knocked down by Graig Nettles, but Garvey flew to center to end the threat.

In the fourth, Dusty Baker flew out and Rick Monday singled to left. Catcher Steve Yeager pulled one over third base, but it kicked out to left fielder Lou Piniella, who gunned out Yeager at second, and Torrez struck out Hooton to strand Monday at third. In the bottom half, catcher Thurman Munson led off and singled to left. On the next pitch, Jackson turned on a fastball and put into the right field seats for a one-run Yankees&#x27; lead, which chased Hooton. With Elias Sosa pitching, Chambliss lifted a high fly to shallow left between Russell and Baker that fell for a double, then went to third on Nettles&#x27; ground out to second. Piniella made it 5–3 with an unchallenged sacrifice fly to left field. Dent walked and Torrez grounded out to shortstop to end the inning.

In the fifth, Lopes flew out to left, Russell walked, and Smith grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Mickey Rivers led off the bottom half with a single up the middle. Willie Randolph bunted, but Yeager pounced on it and forced out Rivers at second for a fielder&#x27;s choice, and Munson hit a low fly to center for the second out. After a throw to first to keep Randolph close, Jackson connected on the first pitch off Sosa, a screaming low line drive into the right field seats to make the score 7–3. Los Angeles manager Tommy Lasorda brought in lefthander Doug Rau to face Chambliss, who grounded out to Garvey at first.

Leading off the bottom of the eighth, Jackson strode to the plate, amid the chants of &quot;REG-GIE, REG-GIE, REG-GIE!&quot;, and drove the first Charlie Hough knuckleball he saw into the center field &quot;batter&#x27;s eye&quot; (empty blackened bleachers) for an 8–3 lead; he became the first to hit three home runs in a World Series game in 49 years, since Babe Ruth (in 1926 and 1928). With his Game 5 first-pitch homer (in the eighth) and his four-pitch walk in the second inning of Game 6, Jackson homered on his last four swings of the bat in the Series, each off a different Dodger pitcher. The last eight pitches delivered to Jackson in the Series were all productive for the Yankees—the four-pitch walk in the second inning allowed him to score on the Chambliss homer.

The Dodgers pushed across a run in the ninth, but Torrez pitched his second complete game win of the Series. It was the first six-game Series since 1959.

==Composite box score==
1977 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.)

This World Series is notable for being a six-game series in which the winning team was outscored. It happened previously in 1918 and 1959 and later in 1992, 1996, and 2003. Seven-game series winners were outscored in 1957, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1991, 1997, and 2002; (equaled in 2016 and 2017).

With complete games pitched consecutively in Games 2 through 6 (all for the winning pitcher), this was the last World Series to be completed without a pitcher recording a save.

==Broadcasting==
The 1977 Series was the first World Series televised by the ABC network since 1949 and the first since television of the Series started in 1947 not to be televised, at least in part, by rival network NBC. NBC had been the exclusive television network of the Series from 1950 to 1976 and had covered that year&#x27;s Yankees–Royals and Dodgers–Phillies playoff series that year. As was customary at the time, the competing teams&#x27; local flagship stations (WPIX in New York and KTTV in Los Angeles) were allowed to air a simulcast of ABC&#x27;s national broadcast.

It was also the first time that the participating teams&#x27; local announcers were not featured during game play on the network telecast, though the Yankees&#x27; Bill White and the Dodgers&#x27; Ross Porter did pre-game TV features, and White handled the post-game celebration in the Yankee clubhouse after they won the title. White and Porter also split the CBS Radio play-by-play for the Series.

==Impact and aftermath==
This World Series cemented Jackson&#x27;s legacy as a postseason performer, giving him the nickname &quot;Mr. October&quot;. Ironically, the Dodgers had had two chances to obtain Jackson: a possible trade with Oakland A&#x27;s in 1975, and an offer of more money than the Yankees during the 1976 off-season.

Twenty-four years later a similar nickname would be given to another Yankee, shortstop Derek Jeter, after a walk-off home run in Game 4 of the 2001 World Series.

Jackson won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and Babe Ruth Award. Lyle won the AL Cy Young Award. Nettles and Garvey both won Gold Glove Awards.

The Yankees and Dodgers met again in the 1978, 1981 and 2024 World Series.

Los Angeles became the first metropolitan area to host a World Series and a Super Bowl in the same calendar year. Super Bowl XI was played January 9, 1977 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

After the 1977 World Series, Melissa Ludtke, a reporter for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, sued MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for having been denied access to the Yankees&#x27; clubhouse during the series, asserting that her 14th Amendment right was violated. Ludtke won her case.

==In popular culture==
The 1977 New York Yankees is one of the key plot points, along with the Son of Sam and the New York City Blackout of 1977, in the movie &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; directed by Spike Lee.

The 1977 Yankees season, including the World Series, is one of the subjects of Jonathan Mahler&#x27;s 2005 non-fiction book &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning&quot;, which was subsequently adapted into the 2007 ESPN mini-series &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;.

<text>Vanier College () is an English-language public college located in the Saint-Laurent borough of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was founded in 1970 as the second English-language public college of Quebec&#x27;s public college system, after Dawson College. Vanier is located just north of CEGEP Saint-Laurent, a French-language public college. Today, the student population numbers over 6,700 full-time Diploma students with an additional 2,000 students attending through the Continuing Education Department (credit and non-credit courses and programs). Vanier College is one of 48 public Cegeps in the province.

==Programs==
Vanier College provides a wide range of programs, offering more than twenty-five areas of study in two-year pre-university and three-year technical fields With an average student population of eight thousand, Vanier College is the second-largest English-language college in Québec. The college offers two program types: a full-time pre-university program and technical career programs that lead to a Diploma of College Studies (DCS). The pre-university programs span two years and cover subject matters that align with the additional year of high school education typically provided in other parts of Canada to prepare students for their chosen university fields. Graduates from Vanier College&#x27;s programs are well-prepared for further studies at the university level [

==Partnerships==
The College of General and Professional Education is affiliated with the Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC) and Canadian Colleges Athletic Association (CCAA).

==Athletics==
The college participates as the Vanier Cheetahs in the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association and the Quebec Student Sport Federation, and is known for its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, football (soccer) and rugby union teams, men&#x27;s Canadian football teams, and women&#x27;s flag football teams.

== History ==

Vanier College was named in honour of Georges Vanier, Canada&#x27;s second native-born Governor General.

=== Before Vanier (1817–1970) ===

Vanier College today consists of 10 different buildings on a single campus. Each of its buildings was built at a different point in the college&#x27;s history, and is identified by a letter of the alphabet.

The land that the campus is located on today was first used for the Village de Saint-Laurent chapel, opened in 1817. Thirty years later, a convent, known as the Couvent Notre-Dame-des-Anges, was built nearby by the Sisters of Holy Cross (fr: Sœurs de Sainte-Croix). The original Convent building was later expanded into the building known as the &quot;C building&quot; today. 

In 1897, the sisters opened the first college on the campus land, on the location of today&#x27;s &quot;E building&quot;. That building was expanded in 1848 and 1857 to become today&#x27;s &quot;E building&quot;. In 1873, a chapel was built that connected the convent and college buildings. That chapel was a forerunner of today&#x27;s &quot;F building&quot;. The &quot;B building&quot; was a further expansion of the convent built on the north side of the &quot;C building&quot; in 1904. It was unclear exactly when the &quot;D building&quot; was built, but it appears to have been at around this same time. The &quot;D building&quot; connected to the rear (east side) of the original &quot;F building&quot; chapel.

Originally, both the &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; buildings had elaborate balconies on every floor, which were removed in the 1970s. This is why several windows on both buildings today are taller than the rest of the windows in the building - these windows were doors to the balconies in the original building design.

In 1911, the original Village de Saint-Laurent chapel was demolished, to be replaced by a new school for young girls, Académie Saint-Alfred. The cupola at the top of the new building was designed to reflect a similar cupola on the original chapel building. This new building eventually became Vanier&#x27;s &quot;H building&quot;.

In 1933, the Sisters opened the yet another college, Collège Basile-Moreau, within the existing convent buildings. This soon required further expansions to the campus. In the 1940s, the &quot;A building&quot; was built at the north end of the &quot;B building&quot;.

In the 1950s, the original &quot;F building&quot; chapel was demolished and replaced with the building that stands as the &quot;F building&quot; today. In 1967, several institutions were merged and became public ones, when the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created.

=== Since becoming Vanier (1970–present) ===

In 1970, the Quebec government purchased the entire property and it was re-opened as Vanier College, Quebec&#x27;s second English language public college (after Dawson College that had opened the year previous). Enrollment in its first year was approximately 1,400 students.

<doc id="1219555" wikidata="Q4295898" url="?curid=1219555" title="1976 World Series">
<text>The 1976 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1976 season. The 73rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Cincinnati Reds and the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. The Reds swept the Series in four games to repeat as champions, avenging their 1939 and 1961 World Series losses to the Yankees. The 1976 Reds became, and remain, the only team to sweep an entire multi-tier postseason, one of the crowning achievements of the franchise&#x27;s Big Red Machine era. They also became the third NL team (following the Chicago Cubs in 1907–08 and the New York Giants in 1921–22) to win consecutive World Series, and remain the last to do so.

This was also the second time that the Yankees were swept in a World Series in four straight games, the Los Angeles Dodgers having previously done so in 1963. (The New York Giants &quot;swept&quot; them in five games in 1922, with Game 2 ending in a tie due to being called on account of darkness.) It was also the first World Series sweep in ten years, and the first for the Reds; their next came against the Oakland Athletics in 1990.

The Reds won the NL West division by ten games over the Dodgers, then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in three straight games in the NL Championship Series, after losing seven of twelve to them during the regular season. The Yankees won the AL East division by games over the Baltimore Orioles, then defeated the Kansas City Royals in the deciding fifth game of the AL Championship Series.

This World Series was the first in which the designated hitter rule, which had been introduced in the AL three years prior, was in effect; it was used for all games (for the first ten years, the use of the DH alternated; in even-numbered years, it was used in all games, in odd-numbered years, it was not used; starting in 1986, the DH was used only in games played at the AL representative&#x27;s park). The use of the DH wound up benefiting the Reds, who were able to get utility infielder Dan Driessen&#x27;s bat in the lineup. Driessen hit .357 with one home run. Elliott Maddox, Carlos May, and Lou Piniella shared the role for the Yankees. Game 1, played at Cincinnati&#x27;s Riverfront Stadium, marked the first time the DH was used in a NL ballpark. Game 2, also at Riverfront Stadium, was the first World Series weekend game to be scheduled at night.

Reds catcher Johnny Bench was named the World Series MVP. Bench batted .533 with 8 hits, 6 RBIs and two home runs and also scored 4 runs.

==Background==

After spending the last two years sharing home field with the New York Mets at Shea Stadium, the 1976 New York Yankees returned home to a rebuilt and modified Yankee Stadium. George Steinbrenner had now owned the team for four years, since 1973, with Billy Martin serving the first of his five stints as manager since 1975. General Manager Gabe Paul made numerous trades getting Mickey Rivers and Ed Figueroa from the Angels for Bobby Bonds; Willie Randolph and Dock Ellis from the Pirates for Doc Medich; and Doyle Alexander, Ken Holtzman, and Grant Jackson from the Orioles for Rudy May, Tippy Martinez, Scott McGregor, and Rick Dempsey.

The heart of the team was Yankee captain, Thurman Munson, whose grit and determination were factors in his winning the 1976 American League MVP award. Third baseman, Graig Nettles, and first baseman, Chris Chambliss were the key run producers, while speedy outfielders Roy White and Rivers set the table for the power hitters. Super free agent Catfish Hunter headed the staff while reliever Sparky Lyle led the A.L. in saves with 23. The Yankees finished ahead in the A.L. East advancing to the World Series by beating the Kansas City Royals in the fifth game of the playoffs on a ninth-inning walk-off home run by Chambliss.

The defending champion Cincinnati Reds were piloted by Sparky Anderson who had a star-studded lineup led by second baseman Joe Morgan. Catcher Johnny Bench, first baseman Tony Perez, and outfielder George Foster provided enough power to drive in sparkplugs Pete Rose, Ken Griffey, and Morgan, who combined power (27 homers, 111 RBI) and speed (67 stolen bases) from the third-spot in the batting order. Morgan went on to win his second-straight National League Most Valuable Player award, outdistancing runner-up teammate Foster. Foster would go on to win the 1977 MVP award, giving the Reds six MVPs in an eight-year stretch. Bench won MVP honors in 1970 and 1972 while Rose took home the hardware in &#x27;73.

The Reds led the NL in every significant offensive category including runs scored, batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, doubles, triples, home runs, RBI, and stolen bases.

On the mound, the Reds relied on left-handers Don Gullett and Fred Norman to pacify the Yankee hitters in Games 1 and 2, respectively. Gullett had come back from a mid-season injury to start Game 1 but had to leave the game in the eighth inning due to a twisted ankle while Norman out-pitched ace Hunter in Game 2. Game 3 in New York pitted effective 1976 NL Rookie of the Year Pat Zachry for the Reds against newly acquired Yankee, Dock Ellis. Ellis only lasted innings, exiting in the fourth after a home run by Driessen. Game 4 was delayed a day due to rain, but the Reds were ready for the sweep. Bench&#x27;s two-run home run gave the Reds a 3–1 lead. In the top of the ninth, a frustrated Billy Martin threw a baseball from the dugout onto the field towards home plate umpire Bill Deegan, causing his ejection from the game. In the ninth, Bench&#x27;s second home run followed by back-to-back doubles by César Gerónimo and Dave Concepción made the score 7–2 and essentially blew the game open. The Cincinnati Reds outscored the New York Yankees, 22–8, and became the first NL team to repeat as World Champions since the 1921–1922 New York Giants. The Reds did not make a single offensive or defensive substitution (save pitching changes) during the entire series. Bench would claim the MVP of the series hitting .533 with two home runs and six runs batted in. His catching counterpart, Thurman Munson, had nine hits, all singles, and a .529 batting average.

==Summary==

: postponed from October 20 due to rain

==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Joe Morgan got the Reds off to a booming start with a home run in the first off of Doyle Alexander, who had to start because Catfish Hunter had a sore arm and needed another day of rest. The Yankees tied the game in the second when Lou Piniella hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Graig Nettles&#x27;s sacrifice fly. In the third, Dave Concepcion tripled with one out and scored on Pete Rose&#x27;s sacrifice fly to put the Reds up 2–1. Tony Pérez&#x27;s RBI single in the sixth extended their lead to 3–1. In the seventh, George Foster hit a leadoff single and scored on a Johnny Bench RBI triple. Bench then scored on a Sparky Lyle wild pitch. The only bad news for the Reds was an injury to starting pitcher Don Gullett, who pulled a calf muscle in the eighth and would be unavailable for the remainder of the Series. It turned out to be Gullett&#x27;s last appearance in a Reds uniform. Pedro Borbon pitched shutout innings to close the game.

===Game 2===

The Reds scored three runs in the second off Catfish Hunter. After a leadoff double by Dan Driessen, George Foster&#x27;s RBI single put the Reds up 1–0. Foster was caught stealing second, but after a double and walk, Dave Concepción&#x27;s RBI single made it 2–0 Reds. A walk loaded the bases before a sacrifice fly by Ken Griffey made it 3–0 Reds. The Yankees got on the board on an RBI single by Graig Nettles in the fourth. In the seventh, the Yankees tied things up on an RBI double by Fred Stanley off starter Fred Norman and an RBI groundout by Thurman Munson off Jack Billingham. Meanwhile, Hunter settled into a groove, pitching a complete game and shutting out the Reds until the ninth. With two outs, Ken Griffey reached second when Stanley threw wildly past first after fielding his slow bouncer. Joe Morgan was walked intentionally and Tony Pérez ended the game by driving in Griffey with a single.

The Sunday night contest, the first weekend World Series game to begin after dark, was played under temperatures that started at 43 °F (6 °C) and dipped into the 30s as the game progressed.
Major League Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn responded to criticism of the scheduling, which was done to accommodate NBC television, by attending the game without wearing an overcoat in spite of the cold nighttime weather.

===Game 3===

As the Series moved to Yankee Stadium, the Reds struck first with three runs off starter Dock Ellis. Dan Driessen hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on an RBI double by George Foster, After Johnny Bench singled, an RBI force-out by César Gerónimo made it 2–0 Reds. Geronimo stole second and scored on an RBI single by Dave Concepción to cap the inning&#x27;s scoring. Dan Driessen smacked a home run in the fourth. In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees got on the board on Oscar Gamble&#x27;s single off of Pat Zachry. A seventh inning home run by Jim Mason—the 500th home run in the history of the World Series—cut the Reds&#x27; lead to 4–2. Mason became the first of two players to hit a home run in his only World Series at-bat, the second being Geoff Blum in 2005 for the Chicago White Sox. The Reds got both runs back in the eighth on Joe Morgan&#x27;s RBI double off Grant Jackson after two leadoff singles and Foster&#x27;s RBI single off Dick Tidrow.

This game featured a slick defensive play by Grant Jackson in the top of the seventh. Johnny Bench hit a hard grounder up the middle which appeared to be a sure base hit, but Jackson speared the ball with his glove behind his back and retired Bench.

This was the first World Series game at Yankee Stadium to open with opera star Robert Merrill&#x27;s famous rendition of the National Anthem.

===Game 4===

The Yankees got on the board in the first (which would be their only lead in this Series) on a two-out Thurman Munson single and a Chris Chambliss double off of Gary Nolan. Munson would collect four hits in the game. In the fourth, Joe Morgan walked off of Ed Figueroa, stole second, and came home on a George Foster single. Johnny Bench followed with his first home run to give the Reds a 3–1 lead. The Yankees cut the lead to 3–2 in the fifth inning when Mickey Rivers hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on Munson&#x27;s single, but the Reds padded that lead in the ninth. Figueroa walked two before being relieved by Dick Tidrow, who allowed a one-out three-run home run to Bench to extend the Reds&#x27; lead to 6–2. César Gerónimo and Dave Concepción followed with consecutive doubles to make 7–2 Reds. Will McEnaney pitched shutout innings to end the series. It was the Reds&#x27; second-straight World Series victory and the second-straight time McEnaney would be on the mound for the Series&#x27; final out. It also, to date, is the only perfect playoff season since the LCS was created in 1969. This was Tony Perez&#x27;s final game in a Reds uniform until 1984. With the win, the Reds became the first visiting team since the 1957 Milwaukee Braves to win the World Series at Yankee Stadium.

==Composite box==
1976 World Series (4–0): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) beat New York Yankees (A.L.).
==Broadcasting==
This was the last of 30 consecutive World Series telecasts by NBC, which had aired the event since 1947; under Major League Baseball&#x27;s new television contract, Series coverage would now alternate between NBC (in even-numbered years) and rival network ABC (in odd-numbered years) each year; this arrangement would end after the 1989 World Series, and CBS would hold exclusive rights to MLB games for the next four years. (A similar setup occurred between and , when Series telecasts would alternate between NBC and Fox.) It was also the last time that local announcers for the participating teams (the Reds&#x27; Marty Brennaman and the Yankees&#x27; Phil Rizzuto, in this case) would be regularly featured on the network telecast.

This was the first of 21 consecutive World Series to be broadcast by CBS Radio.

<text>Kulbir Thapa Magar VC (15 December 1888 – 3 October 1956) was the first Nepalese Gurkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Born on 15 December 1888 in Palpa, Nepal, to Haria Gulte, Thapa was a 26-year-old Rifleman in the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, British Indian Army, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 25 September 1915 in Fauquissart, France Rifleman Kulbir Thapa, having been wounded himself, found a wounded soldier of The Leicestershire Regiment behind the first-line German trench (believed initially to be a 20-year-old soldier from Melton Mowbray by the name of Bill Keightley but since confirmed to be 19152 Private Evan Jones who received a letter from the Adjutant Captain B Dalton, of the 2nd Battalion Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own 3rd Gurkha Rifles, dated the 25th February 1916, requesting details of the action, that was made known in 2014 having been kept by the family together with a photograph of Kulbir Thapa for 99 years). Although urged to save himself, the Gurkha stayed with the wounded man all day and night. Early next day, in misty weather, he dragged him through the German wire, within spitting distance from the Germans, and, leaving him in a place of comparative safety, returned and brought in two wounded Gurkhas, one after the other. He then went back, and, in broad daylight, fetched the British soldier, carrying him most of the way under enemy fire.

Such an incredible act of faith and courage had by now attracted a good deal of attention, and when he emerged from his trench for the third time with one more wounded comrade over his shoulder, the German soldiers actually clapped their hands to encourage the Gurkha on. Only this time, the Gurkha walked right across the No-Mans-Land back to his own side.

The Victoria Cross awarded to Kulbir Thapa was in the first group of awards for the Battle of Loos which were gazetted on 18 November 1915. Of the 18 VCs gazetted that day no less than 17 were presented by the King at Buckingham Palace in nine presentations between December 1915 and January 1917. Kulbir Thapa rejoined his battalion in Egypt on 4 January 1916 and did not receive his medal until a year later. The Governor-General of India, Lord Chelmsford, at a special parade on Tuesday, 30 January 1917, at the vice-regal lodge, Delhi, India, presented medals and orders to 200 Indian officers and men including the Victoria Cross to Rifleman Kulbir Thapa, 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, and two other Indian soldiers.

He later achieved the rank of Havildar.

==Legacy==

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Gurkha Museum in Winchester, Hampshire, England. The Royal Mail issued a 1st class stamp featuring his portrait in their second set of six stamps marking anniversaries of the First World War in May 2015.

On 25 September 2021 a life-size bronze statue of Thapa carrying a wounded British soldier from the Leicestershire Regiment off the battlefield during World War One was unveiled in Princes Gardens in Aldershot in Hampshire. The memorial was commissioned by the Greater Rushmoor Nepali Community to highlight the bond between Nepal and Great Britain dating back more than two centuries. Funded by private donations, the £180,000 statue was created by Hampshire-based sculptor Amy Goodman.

<doc id="1219560" wikidata="Q740404" url="?curid=1219560" title="Battle of Cane Hill">
<text>The Battle of Cane Hill was fought between Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War on November 28, 1862, in northwestern Arkansas, near the town of Cane Hill. Confederate Major General Thomas C. Hindman had made an abortive offensive into southwestern Missouri from Arkansas earlier in the year, but had withdrawn to Arkansas. Union troops under Brigadier General James G. Blunt had followed Hindman into northwestern Arkansas, and the Confederate general saw an opportunity to attack Blunt while his division was separated from the rest of the Union Army of the Frontier. Hindman then sent a force under Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke to Cane Hill, which was also known as Boonsboro, to collect supplies. In early November, a detachment of Blunt&#x27;s command led by Colonel William F. Cloud defeated a small Confederate force commanded by Colonel Emmett MacDonald in the Cane Hill area.

After MacDonald&#x27;s defeat, Marmaduke remained in the Cane Hill area with his force. Blunt moved to attack Marmaduke on November 27. The Confederates expected the Union attack to come up the Cincinnati Road, but it instead followed the Ridge Road and then the Fayetteville Road. Cloud&#x27;s men led the Union advance and made contact with Colonel Joseph O. Shelby&#x27;s Confederate troopers on the morning of November 28. Shelby withdrew from the Cane Hill area after an artillery duel, and Marmaduke reformed his line in the Newburg area.

Due to the Union artillery advantage, the Confederates fell back from Newburg to an elevation known as Reed&#x27;s Mountain. Shelby conducted a rear-guard action by having a series of small forces confront the Union before falling back and allowing the next line to engage. The Confederates made a stand at Reed&#x27;s Mountain, but were forced to withdraw. Blunt continued to pursue, and several miles south of the John Morrow house, Confederate troops led by Colonel Charles A. Carroll laid an ambush for Blunt&#x27;s leading elements. The Confederates then presented a flag of truce as a ruse to give themselves time to withdraw from the field. In early December, Hindman moved to attack Blunt&#x27;s force, but Union reinforcements from Springfield, Missouri, under the command of Brigadier General Francis J. Herron arrived in time to aid Blunt. The ensuing Battle of Prairie Grove was fought on December 7. While the outcome of the fighting was inconclusive, Hindman withdrew from the field and the Union retained control of Missouri and northwestern Arkansas.

== Background ==
In December 1860 and early 1861, states in the South seceded from the United States as a result of several disagreements with the federal government, chief among them the desire to preserve the institution of slavery in the United States, forming the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War began on April 12, when Confederate troops bombarded Fort Sumter. When Abraham Lincoln, the newly inaugurated President of the United States, called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, this proved the catalyst for the southern state of Arkansas to secede and join the Confederacy. Some fighting occurred to the north in Missouri during 1861.

In March 1862, Union forces commanded by Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis defeated a Confederate army commanded by Major General Earl Van Dorn in the Battle of Pea Ridge fought in northwestern Arkansas. After the defeat, Van Dorn abandoned Arkansas and took most of the Confederate soldiers and military supplies in the state with him across the Mississippi River into Tennessee. Curtis moved his army east and captured the Mississippi River city of Helena. On May 31, Major General Thomas C. Hindman took command of Confederate forces in Arkansas, Missouri, and the Indian Territory and rebuilt Confederate military strength in the region. To accomplish this, Hindman used methods that were both unpopular and sometimes extralegal, and he angered many prominent Arkansas civilians. As a result, he was removed from district command by the Confederate government and replaced by Major General Theophilus Holmes.

Hindman retained a field command, and advanced his forces into southwestern Missouri. Curtis, who now commanded the Department of Missouri, formed the Army of the Frontier which was commanded by Brigadier General John M. Schofield. Hindman was temporarily recalled by Holmes, and the two commanders left in charge in his absence performed poorly. By the end of October, the Confederates had been driven back from Missouri into Arkansas, and Schofield had one division, commanded by Brigadier General James G. Blunt, stationed in Benton County in northwestern Arkansas. In early November, the other two divisions of the Army of the Frontier fell back to the vicinity of Springfield, Missouri, while Hindman&#x27;s Confederates occupied Van Buren, Arkansas.

==Prelude==

Hindman saw an opportunity in the Union positioning, since Blunt was isolated from the rest of the Army of the Frontier. Hindman decided to push a cavalry force into the Cane Hill area to distract Blunt, and then isolate Blunt&#x27;s force and defeat it before reinforcements from Springfield could arrive. The Confederate cavalry was commanded by Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke, and in early November, Marmaduke&#x27;s division moved north towards Cane Hill with about 2,000 men and six cannons, collecting provisions from civilians in the area. Blunt learned of this movement, and on November 7, sent Colonel William F. Cloud with 500 men and an artillery battery to attack the Confederates. The next day, Cloud&#x27;s command routed a Confederate cavalry force commanded by Colonel Emmett MacDonald before returning to the main Union camp.

Marmaduke&#x27;s cavalry remained in the general area, raiding mills and collecting supplies. While Marmaduke had around 2,000 men, Union intelligence placed the Confederate strength at 5,000 men. Blunt placed his division into a defensive posture and informed Schofield of the developments; a planned movement east by the divisions at Springfield was cancelled. On November 23, Union reports credited the Confederates at Cane Hill with over 8,000 men, while Blunt had about 6,000 men with him. Wanting to stop the Confederates&#x27; supply-gathering in the Cane Hill area and believing himself abandoned by Schofield, Blunt decided to go on the offensive. Blunt believed that an attack brought the best odds of success, and he was still smarting from an earlier incident in which he assumed a defensive position in the face of a Confederate assault that had never occurred. This advance was delayed by two days while Blunt waited for a group of supply wagons to arrive. Logistics was difficult in the Ozark Mountains and played a major role in the operation and timing of campaigns in the region. While Blunt&#x27;s men had plentiful ammunition, Marmaduke&#x27;s Confederates were short on both ammunition and percussion caps. The Union also had a numerical advantage in artillery: thirty guns to six. Furthermore, most of the Confederate cannons were obsolescent. The Union cavalry&#x27;s horses were in better condition than those of the Confederates, and the Confederates were inadequately uniformed. Leaving on November 27 with 5,000 men, Blunt&#x27;s force reached Rhea&#x27;s Mill the next morning; Rhea&#x27;s Mill was only from Cane Hill.

Marmaduke had planned a strike against a Union position at Elkhorn Tavern, but he learned early on the morning of November 28 that Blunt&#x27;s forces were advancing up the Line Road, so the Elkhorn Tavern movement was cancelled. Ordering his supply wagons to safety, Marmaduke decided to fight a delaying action to buy time for the wagons. Anticipating that the Union forces would take the direct route via the Cincinnati Road, the Confederates took up a position defending that road. However, Blunt approached via the Ridge Road, which intersected the Fayetteville Road before leading to the Cane Hill area. This resulted in the Confederates holding a line facing northwest, while Blunt arrived from the northeast. Patrols from Colonel Joseph O. Shelby&#x27;s force guarded the Fayetteville Road. Two guns from Joseph Bledsoe&#x27;s Missouri Battery were positioned: one aimed down the Cincinnati Road, and the other overlooking the Fayetteville Road.

== Battle ==
After having resumed the movement at 5:00 am on November 28, Blunt&#x27;s advance passed the junction of the Ridge Road and the Fayetteville Road, and Cloud was ordered to take the lead of the column. He sent forward the 2nd Kansas Cavalry Regiment and an artillery battery associated with the regiment that was armed with two mountain howitzers. After having made it to about from the Confederate position without resistance, the Kansans encountered Shelby&#x27;s scouts who withdrew to the main Confederate camp after a brief exchange of fire. The Union pursuit followed to a position below a hill where Bledsoe&#x27;s battery was deployed. Cloud claimed that one of the mountain howitzers opened the ensuing artillery duel, while Confederate staff officer John Newman Edwards claimed that the Confederate artillery fired first. Both historian William L. Shea and a journal article written by Kim Allen Scott and Stephen Burgess side with the Confederate claim to have opened the artillery duel. This exchange of artillery began at about 10:00 am.
Both sides brought up additional cannons. Bledsoe&#x27;s second gun was repositioned, and two cannons from Shoup&#x27;s Arkansas Battery were advanced to the front. On the Union side, six cannons from the 2nd Indiana Battery deployed. Both sides&#x27; batteries fired upon each for about an hour with little effect. By this time, Shelby had determined that Union forces were not using the Cincinnati Road. Blunt found himself with only the small lead force, as the rest of his column had not yet arrived. He sent an aide, Verplanck Van Antwerp, to the rear to hurry forward the rest of his command. Van Antwerp found that the reason for the holdup was that an infantry unit had been placed as the second unit in the marching column. The cavalry units behind the infantry regiment (the 11th Kansas Infantry Regiment) were ordered to pass the marching men, and the 11th Kansas moved forward at double time behind them.

Once the rest of his brigade had arrived, Cloud deployed the additional men. The lead portion of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry was in the front, along with the 1st Indian Home Guard. Hopkins&#x27;s Kansas Battery arrived and was deployed to the rear, with the 2nd Kansas Cavalry in support. The 11th Kansas Infantry was positioned between Hopkins&#x27;s battery and the 2nd Indiana Battery. Seeing the Union attack building, Shelby ordered a retreat. Cloud attacked with 1,500 men, and the fighting soon passed through town, although the Cane Hill College was damaged by artillery fire. On the other side of town were 200 Confederate soldiers commanded by MacDonald, but they too were forced to withdraw.

Positioned beyond Cane Hill at a location known as Kidd&#x27;s Mill was Colonel Charles A. Carroll&#x27;s Confederate brigade. Carroll had about 400 men (less than one quarter of his brigade&#x27;s strength on paper), and two mountain howitzers that were positioned on the Confederate right. The two Confederate cannons were able to temporarily slow the Union advance, but fire from Hopkins&#x27;s battery caused the Confederate cannoneers to withdraw. At least some of Carroll&#x27;s men were armed only with shotguns, and after firing a few volleys with little effect Carroll&#x27;s force withdrew. Shelby&#x27;s men provided a rear guard for Carroll&#x27;s retreat. By this time it was around noon, and the fighting was shifting to the south toward Newburg.

Marmaduke had formed a line near Newburg that Blunt considered to be a strong one. Expecting the Confederates to stand and fight, Blunt took the time to reorganize his force. Besides allowing Cloud&#x27;s disorganized brigade to gather, Blunt also brought up Colonel William Weer&#x27;s brigade. Six Parrott rifles from the 1st Kansas Battery as well as the guns of the 2nd Indiana Battery opened fire on the Confederate position; Bledsoe&#x27;s battery and the two mountain howitzers from Carroll&#x27;s brigade returned fire at about 1:00 pm. Not long after the exchange began, the Confederate forces withdrew, moving down the Van Buren Road. Shea and historian Henry F. Hartsell state that Marmaduke&#x27;s decision to withdraw was at least partially informed by the fact that his artillery was much less effective than that of the Union.

The battle then transitioned into a running fight. Reed&#x27;s Mountain was located south of Newburg. The mountain was about higher than the terrain around it. During the Confederate retreat towards Reed&#x27;s Mountain was reached, Shelby responded with defensive tactics that Scott and Burgess refer to as &quot;brilliant&quot;. Shelby aligned his men in a series of lines, with soldiers on either side of the road. When the Union soldiers encountered the front line, the Confederate troops fired, before quickly retreating. The Union troops would then encounter Shelby&#x27;s next prepared line. At about 2:00 pm, Marmaduke decided to make a stand at Reed&#x27;s Mountain, deploying Shelby and MacDonald in a forward line with Carroll&#x27;s men further up the mountain. Shea attributes the decision to defend the mountain to a fear that continuing the retreat at the current pace would allow the Union troops to catch up to the wagons. However, Scott and Burgess state that the wagons would already have been safe by that point, and that Marmaduke was instead trying to create an opportunity for Hindman to advance with the main Confederate force and attack Blunt.

Blunt was personally with the lead Union units at this point, and he along with part of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry and the 3rd Indian Home Guard were the first Union forces to reach Reed&#x27;s Mountain. Blunt decided to attack the Reed&#x27;s Mountain position, and the men he had with him, who were joined by the 11th Kansas Infantry not long after, advanced against the Confederate line. The 6th Kansas Cavalry Regiment was also involved in this stage of the fighting. The Confederate troops tended to fire over the heads of the Union troops. At times, the fighting became hand-to-hand, and at one point, MacDonald&#x27;s men made a small counterattack. After about half an hour of fighting on the mountain, visibility became very poor due to smoke, as the brush had caught fire. The reduction in visibility sometimes prevented the two sides from seeing each other. Blunt brought up artillery, including four mountain howitzers that fired on the Confederate lines at very short range. Bledsoe&#x27;s guns had to withdraw due to lack of ammunition, and another Confederate cannon was damaged and forced to withdraw. With his cavalrymen running low on ammunition as well, Marmaduke ordered a withdrawal. The fight for Reed&#x27;s Mountain had lasted about an hour and a half.

As Shelby&#x27;s men retreated, they taunted Carroll&#x27;s men for the minimal role they had played in the battle. Carroll ordered his men to form a line and then fire a single volley at the advancing Union troops before withdrawing. At around 5:00 pm, the pursuit reached a house owned by John Morrow where the Confederate retreat turned to the south. Carroll&#x27;s men began to panic, and the Confederate retreat became more disorganized; Carroll later referred to the conduct of his own soldiers as &quot;disgraceful&quot;. Either or south of the Morrow house, the Confederates laid a trap. In a hollow that was wider than the portion of the valley to the north, Carroll aligned men from Shelby&#x27;s command and Monroe&#x27;s Arkansas Cavalry Regiment. Blunt had aggressively pushed ahead with only a small force from the 6th Kansas Cavalry, hoping to capture the Confederate cannons.

When Blunt and the 6th Kansas Cavalry reached the Confederate ambuscade, the Confederate cavalrymen opened fire, throwing the Union troops into confusion. Carroll ordered 85 men led by Monroe to attack, in order to allow the rest of his force to retire. Cloud had arrived on the scene with parts or all of three artillery batteries, as well as portions of the 3rd Indian Home Guard and the 11th Kansas Infantry. What happened next is the subject of disagreement among participants in the battle. Confederate reports generally do not mention a flag of truce being presented, although Edwards, whose writings on the battle tend to be hyperbolic and careless with the truth, claimed that Union forces presented one. Union accounts claim that the Confederates presented a flag of truce in the waning moments of the fight. Shea along with Scott and Burgess take the position that the Confederates did present a flag of truce at the end of the battle as a ruse to give the battered Confederate forces time to break contact and leave the area. The Confederates used the lull to successfully break contact and get away while aid was being provided to wounded soldiers. The fighting had lasted for about nine hours and had taken place over 12 or 15 miles (19 or 24 km) of ground.

==Aftermath==
Shea and Scott and Burgess place Union losses as eight men killed and thirty-six wounded, with Scott and Burgess also mentioning that Blunt reported the capture of a Lieutenant Campbell. Official Confederate reports admitted losses of five men killed, twenty-eight wounded, and six men missing in action, although no casualty reports from Shelby are known to exist. A Confederate officer later estimated that Marmaduke lost 10 men killed and 50 wounded. Shea places Confederate battle losses at ten killed and at least 70 wounded or missing. Preservationist Frances E. Kennedy estimates losses as 41 for Blunt and 45 for Marmaduke. Historian Don Montgomery places Union losses as two killed and thirty-eight wounded, and states that Confederate casualties are unknown, but were probably double those of the Union. A 2006 battlefield guide prepared by Shea and historians Earl J. Hess, Richard W. Hatcher, and William Garrett Piston places Union losses at six killed and thirty-five wounded, and Confederate casualties as ten killed, 66 wounded, and six missing. Historian Stephen B. Oates has Blunt&#x27;s loss at eight men killed and thirty-two wounded and similar Confederate casualties. Both Shea and Scott and Burgess note that casualties were lower than would be expected under the circumstances. Scott and Burgess suggest that the reasons for this include weapons that were ineffective except at close range, terrain difficulties, poor aim, the tactics the Confederates used, and the fact that only portions of each army were engaged at any one time. Oates attributes the low casualty totals to Marmaduke&#x27;s tactics, suggesting that if Marmaduke had attempted to fight a decisive defensive battle then his command would probably have been completely wrecked.

Both sides were able to view the results of the battle as having accomplished their goals. Blunt held the field after the battle, and had driven Marmaduke from the area, while the Confederates had escaped with their supply train and drawn Blunt further south: Blunt&#x27;s Union soldiers were now much closer to the main Confederate force than to their reinforcements. Blunt claimed victory, while the Confederates viewed the action as only a setback. Scott and Burgess compare the outcome of the battle to a hung jury. The 2006 battlefield guide describes the battle as a Union tactical victory. According to Oates, Marmaduke&#x27;s men learned lessons in cavalry fighting that would later be put to use in raids into Missouri. After the fighting ended, Blunt withdrew his forces to Cane Hill, and it became the base of operations for his division. Marmaduke withdrew his men to Lee Creek, and then fell back to Dripping Springs, which was north of Van Buren. Union troops looted the Cane Hill College during the early portion of their stay at Cane Hill.

On December 3, Hindman moved his army north from Van Buren to attack Blunt; the day before, Blunt had suspected that the Confederates were going to be on the move, and he ordered the two divisions at Springfield to join him while he took up defensive positions near Cane Hill. The divisions near Springfield were commanded by Brigadier General Francis J. Herron, who after receipt of the message from Blunt, moved his men south on foot in three and a half days. On December 6 Hindman learned of Herron&#x27;s approach, and he decided to confront Herron first instead of Blunt. On the morning of December 7, the Confederates made a stand near Prairie Grove, and Herron and his men arrived that morning as well. The two forces made contact and the Battle of Prairie Grove began. Hindman&#x27;s and Herron&#x27;s men fought inconclusively in the morning, before Blunt arrived in the afternoon and joined the fighting. While neither side gained a major advantage, the Confederates withdrew after nightfall. The fighting at Prairie Grove ensured that Missouri and northwestern Arkansas remained under Union control.

A portion of the Cane Hill battlefield, about , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 as the Cane Hill Battlefield. The Arkansas Civil War Centennial Commission erected a highway marker near the battle site to interpret the fighting. While the town of Cane Hill was a regional cultural center at the time of the battle, it has since greatly declined.

<text>Donauwörth (; Swabian: &quot;Donawerd&quot;) is a town and the capital of the Donau-Ries district in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is said to have been founded by two fishermen where the rivers Danube (Donau) and Wörnitz meet. The city is part of the scenic route called &quot;Romantische Straße&quot; (Romantic Road).

The city is situated between Munich and Nuremberg, 46 km north of Augsburg.

==History==
Donauwörth grew up in the course of the 11th and 12th centuries under the protection of the castle of Mangoldstein, became in the 13th century a seat of Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria, who, however, soon withdrew to Munich to escape from his wife, Duchess Maria of Brabant, whom he had there beheaded on an unfounded suspicion of infidelity. The town received the freedom of the Holy Roman Empire in 1308, and maintained its position in spite of the encroachments of Bavaria till 1607, when the interference of the Protestant inhabitants with the abbot of the Heilig-Kreuz called forth an imperial law authorizing the duke of Bavaria to punish them for the offence.

It is historically important to Germany as the site of one of the incidents which led to the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). In 1606, the Lutheran majority barred the Catholic Church residents of the town from holding an annual Markus procession, causing a riot to break out. During the war, it was stormed by Gustavus Adolphus (1632) and captured by Ferdinand III (1634).

Donauwörth was later the scene of the Battle of Schellenberg (or Battle of Donauwörth) on 2 July 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1713). The battle was named after the village and high ground behind the city. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, was marching from Flanders to Bavaria and came to the Danube. The French decided to make a crossing of the Danube at Donauwörth, where they were surprised by Marlborough&#x27;s troops and after heavy fighting pulled back. That allowed Marlborough to capture Donauwörth and cross the Danube without any problem. Another battle of Donauwörth on 7 October 1805 opened Napoleon&#x27;s Ulm campaign.

<text>Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney (24 December 1892 – 18 September 1918) was a Canadian soldier. Nunney was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in Hastings in East Sussex, he was sent to Canada as a home child.

Nunney was one of the seven Canadians to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions across the 30 km long Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France. The other six were Bellenden Hutcheson, Arthur George Knight, William Henry Metcalf, Cyrus Wesley Peck, Walter Leigh Rayfield and John Francis Young.

==Early life==
Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney VC is buried in Aubigny Communal Cemetery Extension; he was born in Hastings as Stephen Sargent Claude Nunney. His father was William Percy Nunney and his mother Mary Nunney formerly Sargent at 42 Bexhill Road, Hastings on 19 July 1892. His father was born in Burford, Oxfordshire. Claude, as he was called within his family, was the fourth of eight children. The family left Hastings in 1895 and moved to Kentish Town, St Pancras, in London where his mother was to sadly die of food poisoning in February 1899. Two of Claude&#x27;s younger siblings died very young, and of the remaining six, five passed into the care of the Catholic Church. The three boys born in Hastings, Frederick George, Stephen Claude and Alfred Nunney all became &quot;Home Children&quot; in Canada.

Alfred and Stephen Nunney travelled together aboard the SS Tunisian in October 1905 to Quebec and then on to St George&#x27;s Home at Hintonburg, Ottawa, Ontario. They were sent to different families, Alfred moving to the Micksburg County, Renfrew, and Claude to North Lancaster. Alfred was just twelve, as he was born on 29 September 1893, and Claude thirteen when they went in their separate directions. Claude Nunney was placed with Mrs Donald Roy McDonald.

Unbeknownst to Claude, his brother George Nunney, who came as a Home Child to Canada in October 1904, was drowned on the 19 July 1908 in the Jock River, Jockvale, around 150 km from North Lancaster. He was aged only 17. He had also been born in Hastings on 27 December 1890. He had been placed with Patrick Houlahan, a local farmer.

There has been some debate as to Nunney&#x27;s origins. Whilst Nunney himself stated he was born in Dublin, Ireland, he was actually born in Hastings, England as Stephen Sargent Claude Nunney. Also it is claimed that Nunney did not become a Canadian citizen by naturalisation, but by becoming part of the Home Children program.

Dave Lorente (Homechildren Canada) wrote in an article on Claude:
&quot;Canada&#x27;s Magnificent Seven&quot; were the seven Canadian soldiers who all earned the Victoria Cross on 2 September 1918. 

Nunney initially joined the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders in 1913, before joining the 38th Battalion (Ottawa), CEF and thus Nunney is claimed by both the SD&amp;G Highlanders and the Cameron Highlanders.

==Victoria Cross Award==
Nunney was a member of the 38th (Ottawa) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force which is perpetuated by the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa (Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own). Nunney was a private in the First World War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC:
He died aged 25, 16 days after receiving what proved to be mortal wounds and was buried at Aubigny Communal Cemetery Extension, near Aubigny-en-Artois (Grave reference number IV. B. 39).

==The medal==
All of Nunney&#x27;s medals (he had earlier in the war won the Military Medal and the Distinguished Conduct Medal at the Battle of Vimy Ridge), including his VC are displayed above the fireplace at Cornwall Armoury in Cornwall, Ontario.

<text>Charles Melvin VC (2 May 1885 – 17 July 1941) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==The Medal==
Private Melvin&#x27;s citation for the award of the Victoria Cross, as published in the Supplement to the London Gazette (dated 26 November 1917), states:

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Black Watch Museum &quot;(Perth, Scotland)&quot;. Melvin is commemorated with a plaque on Kirriemuir Town Hall, a carved flagstone in Kirriemuir&#x27;s Cumberland Close, and a street called Charles Melvin Gardens, also in Kirriemuir.

<doc id="1219567" wikidata="Q2456451" url="?curid=1219567" title="Digital Signal 3">
<text>Digital Signal 3 (DS3 or T3 line) is a digital signal level 3 T-carrier. The data rate for this type of signal is 44.736 Mbit/s (45 Mb). It can transport 28 DS1 level signals within its payload. It can transport 672 DS0 level channels within its payload.

Such circuits are the usual kind between telephony carriers, both wired and wireless, and typically by OC1 optical connections.

==Cabling==
DS3 interconnect cables must be made with true 75-ohm coaxial cable and connectors. Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower the performance of the connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, &quot;Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable&quot;, defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and cable stripping tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the most reliable 75 ohm connectors known. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly terminated, though it does not meet telephony technical standards. Type 735 26 AWG is used for interconnects up to 225 feet, and Type 734 20 AWG is used for interconnects up to 450 feet.

==Pricing==
DS3 service is provided to businesses in the United States through incumbent local exchange carrier and competitive local exchange carrier communication providers. The price, much like a T1 (or DS1) line, has two primary components: the loop (which is distance-sensitive) and the port (or the price the carrier charges to access the internet through their proprietary network).

<doc id="1219569" wikidata="Q5499092" url="?curid=1219569" title="Frederick Lumsden">
<text>Brigadier-General Frederick William Lumsden, (14 December 1872 – 4 June 1918) was a British officer in Royal Marine Artillery and during the First World War. During his service he was decorated four times for valorous service and saw action in several major campaigns before he was killed just months before the war&#x27;s end in June 1918. Amongst his decorations was the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry to British or Commonwealth troops. He was also the first of seven British officers to be awarded the DSO four times in the First World War.

==Early life==
Frederick William Lumsden was born into a military family in Faizabad, India, on 14 December 1872. His father, John James Foot Lumsden, worked in the Indian Civil Service. At a young age he returned to Britain and attended Bristol Grammar School.

Lumsden married Mary, the daughter of Lieutenant General Thomas N. Harward of the Royal Artillery, in December 1894. They had one daughter, Violet.

==Military career==
Lumsden joined the Royal Marine Artillery as a junior officer in September 1890. He served in the Marine Service until 1907, spending time in the Mediterranean and four years on Ascension Island. He entered the British Army Staff College, qualifying in 1908. He then became the second staff officer at Singapore, and was promoted to the rank of major in 1913. He returned home for war service in the months leading up to the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914. He served in France with the Royal Marine howitzer brigade in France until 1915 and was then seconded to serve in staff appointments with the British Army. In late 1915 he was attached to the Intelligence Department of First Army Headquarters. He was promoted to the rank of temporary brigadier general to command the 14th Infantry Brigade in April 1917.

==Awards and decorations==
On 1 January 1917, Major Lumsden was awarded his first Distinguished Service Order &quot;for distinguished service in the field&quot;. The first and second Bars to his DSO were gazetted together in May 1917, and he was the first person to receive a third Bar in April 1918.

On 8 June 1917, the awarding of the Victoria Cross (VC) to Major Lumsden was approved. This was for actions that took place between 3 and 4 April 1917 in Francilly, France. The citation in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; reads as follows:
He was appointed as a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1918, just a few days before he was killed, &quot;shot through the head by a rifle bullet and killed instantly&quot;, according to a fellow officer. He was also mentioned in despatches on four occasions, and awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre.

==Death and remembrance==
Lumsden was killed in action in his 46th year at Blairville, near the city of Arras, France, on 4 June 1918. His body was buried in the Berles New Military Cemetery, Berles-au-Bois, France.

In 1920 the Mess of the Royal Marines commissioned H. Donald Smith to paint two portraits of Lumsden. The work is now housed in the Royal Marines Museum in the Royal Marine Artillery Barracks, Southsea, Portsmouth. His VC is also displayed at the museum.

<text>The 1974 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1974 season. The 71st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion (and two-time defending World Series champion) Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Athletics won the series, four games to one; after splitting the first two in Los Angeles, Oakland swept their three home games to close it out.

Rollie Fingers figured in three of the four Oakland victories, posting a win and two saves, and was honored with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. Oakland became the first team to win three consecutive Series since the New York Yankees won five straight (1949–1953); the win secured the Athletics&#x27; status as one of the truly dominant teams of the 1970s. (The other &quot;team of the decade,&quot; the Cincinnati Reds, won consecutive World Series in 1975 and 1976, after falling short in 1970 and 1972.)

This was the first all-California World Series; these two teams met again fourteen years later, with a different result.

==Background==

The 1974 Los Angeles Dodgers were the second (after the runner-up 1962 squad) Dodgers team to win at least 100 games since moving west from Brooklyn; they won the National League West division after a season long battle by four games over the Cincinnati Reds, then defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates three games to one in the National League Championship Series. The Oakland Athletics won the American League West division by five games over the Texas Rangers, then defeated the Baltimore Orioles three games to one in the American League Championship Series.

===Oakland Athletics===

The Oakland Athletics, at the height of their dynasty as the &quot;Swingin&#x27; A&#x27;s&quot;, had consistently matching their on-field heroics with locker-room meltdowns and intra-squad theatrics for the American League. After yet another banner year (Catfish Hunter won 25 games, Reggie Jackson knocked in 105 runs, and Billy North stole 54 bases), the team seemed to be winning more attention for its dysfunctional communication patterns than for its superior lineup. Hunter was threatening to file for free agency in 1975 if owner Charles O. Finley didn&#x27;t come through with back pay Hunter claimed he had coming. Traumatized former second baseman Mike Andrews was considering legal action for the shabby treatment he received in the previous year&#x27;s World Series. Teammates Rollie Fingers and Blue Moon Odom had gotten into a fistfight. And the Series-winning manager of the previous year, Dick Williams was long gone, having had one personality clash too many with the Athletics front office. Despite all the melodrama, the Athletics won the pennant for the third straight year, the first time a team had done so since the 1960-64 New York Yankees. They had dispatched the Baltimore Orioles in a four-game ALCS. Notwithstanding the off-field troubles, between the lines they were fundamentally sound, had strong pitching, and combined speed and power.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

Los Angeles won 102 games, boasted the best team ERA (2.97) in the National League, and led their league in runs scored (798). Steve Garvey hit .312, Jimmy Wynn knocked in 108 runs, Bill Buckner hit .314 in one of the best years of his career, Davey Lopes stole 59 bases, Andy Messersmith won twenty games, and Don Sutton won nineteen games. Walter Alston was in his 21st year as manager of the club.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
Reggie Jackson put the A&#x27;s on the board first with a homer in the top of the second off 20-game winner Andy Messersmith. The A&#x27;s added another run in the fifth when starting pitcher Ken Holtzman, batting for the first time all season because of the designated hitter rule, doubled to left, went to third on a Messersmith wild pitch, and scored on a Bert Campaneris suicide squeeze bunt.

The Dodgers crept back with a run in their half of the fifth when Davey Lopes reached first on an error by Campaneris. Bill Buckner then bounced a single to right that Jackson misplayed, allowing Lopes to score.

The A&#x27;s scored their final run in the eighth when Campaneris singled to shallow center, was sacrificed to second by Bill North, and scored when Dodger third baseman Ron Cey threw wildly to first on a grounder hit by Sal Bando. Bando reached third on the error, and attempted to score on a flyout to right by Jackson, but right fielder Joe Ferguson gunned him down at the plate.

In the bottom of the ninth, with Rollie Fingers on the mound, Jimmy Wynn hit a homer that just escaped the reach of Joe Rudi and North in left center. Following a single by Steve Garvey, Catfish Hunter relieved Fingers and made the final out by striking out Ferguson. Fingers got the win with innings of relief, having relieved Holtzman in the fifth inning

===Game 2===
Don Sutton pitched superbly, shutting out the A&#x27;s on four hits through eight innings. The Dodgers scored first in the second off Vida Blue when Ron Cey walked, Bill Russell singled, and Steve Yeager singled home Cey. Joe Ferguson slammed a two-run homer off Blue in the sixth inning to make it 3–0.

The A&#x27;s threatened in the eighth when pinch hitters Jim Holt and Claudell Washington hit back-to-back singles with one out. Bert Campaneris reached on an infield error to load the bases. The rally was squelched when Bill North hit into a double play in which first baseman Steve Garvey made an exceptional pickup of a low throw by Russell.

In the ninth inning the A&#x27;s finally got on the board when Sal Bando led off with being hit by a pitch, Reggie Jackson followed with a double, and Joe Rudi singled both runners home. Mike Marshall then relieved Sutton and struck out Gene Tenace. Herb Washington was sent in to pinch-run for Rudi, and Marshall picked him off. Herb Washington was the only &quot;designated runner&quot; to appear in a World Series. Washington was a track star with no baseball experience whom the A&#x27;s Charles Finley signed solely to appear as a pinch runner in late game situations. His stats for 1974 were 92 games, zero at bats, 29 runs scored, 29 stolen bases, but he was caught stealing 16 times. Sure enough, with the A&#x27;s trailing 3–2 in the ninth inning of Game 2, Washington pinch ran. Just after announcer Vin Scully said that Washington better be careful because pitcher Mike Marshall has a good pickoff move, he was promptly picked off first base. Marshall then retired Ángel Mangual for the final out.

===Game 3===
With the Series shifting back to Oakland, it was A&#x27;s ace Catfish Hunter&#x27;s turn to be brilliant. Hunter shut out the Dodgers on four hits through seven innings, and his teammates provided him with two runs in the third when Bill North scored on an error by catcher Joe Ferguson and an RBI single by Joe Rudi. The A&#x27;s added another run in the fourth on Bert Campaneris&#x27; RBI single.

The Dodgers got their only runs on homers by Bill Buckner in the eighth and Willie Crawford in the ninth.

Rollie Fingers was not awarded the save because in 1974, tougher criteria were adopted for saves where the tying run had to be on base or at the plate when the reliever entered to qualify for a save.

===Game 4===
The A&#x27;s struck first on a solo homer by the surprising Ken Holtzman in the third. The Dodgers came right back in their half of the fourth on a two-run triple by Bill Russell. Holtzman settled into a groove after that, surrendering no runs before yielding to Rollie Fingers in the eighth.

The A&#x27;s took control of the game with four runs in the sixth off Andy Messersmith. Bill North led off with a walk and went to second on a wild pickoff throw by Messersmith. Sal Bando singled home North to tie it. After a Reggie Jackson walk, a Joe Rudi sacrifice bunt, and an intentional walk to Claudell Washington, Jim Holt pinch-hit for Ray Fosse and singled in two runs. An RBI groundout by Dick Green capped off the rally. Fingers pitched the final innings for his first save of the series.

===Game 5===
The A&#x27;s staked Vida Blue to a 2–0 lead with single runs in the first and second innings on a sacrifice fly by Sal Bando and a homer by Ray Fosse. The Dodgers tied it in the sixth with two runs on a sacrifice fly by Jimmy Wynn and an RBI single by Steve Garvey.

Joe Rudi got what would turn out to be the game-winning RBI when he tagged Dodger ace reliever Mike Marshall with a homer in the bottom of the seventh. The half-inning was delayed when Bill Buckner complained of A&#x27;s fans throwing debris onto the field. 
Marshall, who always pitched in short sleeves, disdained his allowance of eight warm up pitches after coming in from the bullpen even after the delay. Rudi then proceeded to deposit Marshall&#x27;s first pitch over the left field wall.

In the Dodgers half of the eighth, Buckner led off with a base hit to center that got past center fielder Bill North. Buckner had an easy double, but tried to stretch it to a triple and Reggie Jackson, backing up North, fired a perfect throw to Dick Green, who relayed to Sal Bando at third to nail Buckner and squelch the last Dodger threat. Rollie Fingers got his second save and was named Series MVP.

==Aftermath==
Four of the five games had the score of 3–2. Mike Marshall of the Los Angeles Dodgers was the only pitcher to appear in all five games of a five-game World Series, .

The Dodgers got six more hits than the A&#x27;s but scored five fewer runs, showing their lack of timely hitting. They also made six errors in five games, in addition to a number of mental errors.

The champion A&#x27;s batted only .211 in the Series, the lowest in a five-game Series since the Baltimore Orioles hit .146 and lost in 1969.

, the A&#x27;s are the only team besides the Yankees to win three consecutive World Series.

This was the first World Series to end at night. While it opened with traditional day games (1 pm PDT) on the weekend in Los Angeles, the three weeknight games in Oakland (5:30 pm PDT) were all in prime-time (for the Eastern and Central time zones).

As World Series champions, the A&#x27;s earned a postseason bonus of $22,219 each; the Dodger shares were $15,704 each, while the Orioles and Pirates took about $7,400 each.

This was the last major league championship for a Bay Area team won in its home stadium or arena until the Golden State Warriors won the 2017 NBA Finals in Oakland, ending a streak of 13 Bay Area championships won in an opponent or neutral stadium or arena. Also, with the Warriors winning the 1975 NBA Finals, Oakland (and the Bay Area in particular) won both the World Series and NBA championship in a span of a season or calendar year, a distinction previously earned by New York when the Mets and Knicks won their league championships within a year&#x27;s span. This was followed by the Los Angeles metropolitan area in 1981–82 (Dodgers and Lakers), 1988 (Dodgers and Lakers), 2002 (Angels and Lakers) and 2020 (Lakers and Dodgers), Boston in 2007–08 (Red Sox and Celtics), and the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014–15 (Giants and Warriors).

==Composite box==
1974 World Series (4–1): Oakland Athletics (A.L.) over Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.)

At the time, the winning margin of five runs tied for second-lowest for a five-game series (with 1933 and 1942); the 1915 margin was two runs, and three runs in 2000.

<text>The Siemens SL45 was the first mobile phone with memory expansion and an MP3 player, which debuted in late 2000. An improved version, the SL45i, was also the first phone to have a Java virtual machine.

In addition to the MP3 player, SL45 offered other advanced features such as dictaphone with several hours of recording time, auto responder, voice dialing and voice commands, WAP browser, and context sensitive help in several languages.
Other software include calendar/organizer, alarm clock, stopwatch, calculator, currency converter and games. While the SL45 was one of the most advanced phones in its time, it was also one of the smallest.

== Versions ==
The Siemens SL45 came in three versions:
* Siemens SL45 - original edition, with a 32 MB memory card, sync station and stereo headphones in the package
* Siemens SL42 - a cheaper version introduced later, with a 16 MB memory card and no sync station or headphones
* Siemens SL45i - a version with a new firmware with Java support, and a slightly stronger battery

These three phones are electronically identical, and the SL45i&#x27;s firmware can be installed in the SL42 and SL45, thus enhancing them with a Java virtual machine.

== Criticism ==
The SL45 series was a professional model and thus very highly priced at the time of release. It was sometimes criticized for its bugginess, particularly in that simply sending too many SMSs could cause the phone to crash, and for being relatively delicate - there are many known issues of vibration alert, or MP3 player control buttons on the side of the case stopping functioning after phone fall.

== Firmware ==
The SL42, SL45 and SL45i share the same electronic components, and thus firmware can be exchanged between them. It can enhance functionality of SL42 and SL45 with Java support. Relatively simple structure of the firmware code, and the ease of new firmware installation (standard serial cable included in the box is suitable) led to many custom firmware modifications (more than 300 patches) sprung over the Internet. These correct software bugs, change the phone&#x27;s graphics, or even add new functionality like key remapping, calling pictures, or detailed battery information, and even up to 15 virtual SIM-cards (user must reboot phone to select virtual SIM from list).

== User base ==
Due to the above-mentioned firmware enhanceability, availability of many Java applications further enhancing the feature set (with, for example, sending of long SMS messages, e-book reading, video playing, and E-mail client functionality), MP3 player functionality and memory card slot, and also for being fairly priced after a few years since its release, the SL45 series gained a huge user base, constantly developing new firmware patches, Java applications and hardware modifications, enhancing the phone&#x27;s functionality. Many fans of the model claim that there is no mobile phone which can replace the SL45i (either the original one, or SL42/45 enhanced with SL45i firmware) for them.

The phone is indeed very versatile and has a huge feature set, especially when compared to other phones of its time, although it lacks many features now considered standard for modern phones, like colour display, integrated camera, polyphonic or digitized ringtones, Bluetooth and GPRS functionality. Modern phones with memory card support also can be natively connected to a computer&#x27;s USB port, greatly improving transfer speeds when compared to the SL45&#x27;s serial connection; this limitation can be, however, omitted by using a third-party memory card reader.

<text>The Bergisel is a hill (746 m) that lies to the south of Innsbruck, Austria, in the area of Wilten, where the Sill river meets the Inn Valley.

The word&#x27;s first syllable &quot;Berg-&quot; doesn&#x27;t correspond etymologically to the German word &quot;Berg&quot; with the meaning &quot;mountain&quot;. The Bergisel&#x27;s contemporary name is derived from the pre-Roman word &quot;burgusinus&quot; (elevated position), which then altered through folk etymology, causing the occasional spelling &quot;Berg Isel&quot; or its English equivalent &quot;Mount Isel&quot;.

Among its earlier uses were as a cremation site and as a habitation area during the Iron Age.

In 1809, Bergisel was the site of the four Battles of Bergisel under the command of the freedom fighter Andreas Hofer. In 1892, the Andreas Hofer monument was erected in order to commemorate the battles.

Since 1952, Innsbruck has hosted one leg of the Four Hills Tournament. The Bergiselschanze was built of concrete for the 1964 Winter Olympics to replace an older, smaller ramp. It was also used for the 1976 Winter Olympics. A new ramp was opened in 2003, designed by the architect Zaha Hadid, as the old one no longer conformed to contemporary requirements of ski jumping.

Until an accident following a mass panic, which resulted in several deaths, the Bergisel stadium was also the site of the Air &amp; Style snowboard festival.

Both the Brenner railway and the Brennerautobahn have tunnels below the Bergisel. The Sill Gorge, a recreational site, is located at its base.

The Bergisel can be reached by the Stubaitalbahn from Innsbruck, exiting at Station Sonnenburgerhof, or by the Tram 1, at Station Bergisel.

<text>Zakspeed () is a motor racing team from Germany, founded in 1968 by Erich Zakowski and then run by his son Peter Zakowski. It is based in Niederzissen, Rhineland-Palatinate, around from the Nürburgring circuit.

The team was, together with the Rial Racing, one of the two last German Formula One teams based in Germany (with the Zakspeed&#x27;s base in Niederzissen).

==1973 to 1981: Saloon and sports car racing==
 Zakowski founded Zakspeed in 1973 with the ambition of competing in sports car racing. In the late 1970s, the team became the official Ford team in the German Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (DRM) series, a predecessor of the current DTM. Zakspeed constructed and entered an FIA Group 2 Escort and the Group 5 Capri, based on the MKIII production model. During this period, the team achieved a number of victories including the overall championship in 1981 with driver Klaus Ludwig.

In the early 1980s, Zakspeed also prepared a Mustang for Ford USA&#x27;s Special Vehicle Operations to race in the domestic IMSA Camel GT series. The Mustang chassis was based on the Group 5 Capri.

==1982 to 1989: Endurance cars and F1==
In 1982, Zakspeed ran the works Ford C100 Group C effort in conjunction with the factory. The Zakspeed-prepared machine was run by the works Ford Germany team with Klaus Ludwig, Manfred Winkelhock and Marc Surer at the wheel. The car was a midfielder at best, although Jonathan Palmer and Desiré Wilson scored a 4th place overall the 1000 km of Brands Hatch in 1982. Ford Germany retracted their support and one car was sold to privateers, while the other chassis was evolved by Zakspeed into the C1/4 and the C1/8, making few appearances in international racing, but becoming a front-runner in the German Interserie, where it won the championship in 1984 with Klaus Niedzwiedz.

The engine was the basis for their Formula One entry from 1985 to 1988. Zakspeed became notable for building their own chassis and engine, something only Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Renault did at that time. After a maiden season with Jonathan Palmer, the team hired the first Formula 3000 champion Christian Danner and ex-Tyrrell driver Martin Brundle. The team&#x27;s best result (and only points finish) was Brundle&#x27;s 5th place in the 1987 San Marino Grand Prix.

For their final season, in 1989, Zakspeed switched to Yamaha engines as turbos were banned. The Japanese engine was unreliable and drivers Bernd Schneider (former German Formula 3 champion), Piercarlo Ghinzani and the rookie Aguri Suzuki struggled to pre-qualify the car. Schneider only qualified the car twice and retired both times, while Suzuki never got past pre-qualifying.

==1990s and beyond: Return to sports and touring cars==
After withdrawing from F1, Zakspeed focused again exclusively on sport cars. The team ran Mercedes 190E and Opel Calibra cars in the 1990s Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft and the short-lived ITC series. Around this time, Peter Zakowski, who had raced in Formula 3 and endurance races (he had won the 24 Hours Nürburgring in 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2002) took over from his father.

In 1998, Zakspeed entered two Porsche 911 GT1 in the FIA GT Championship, where French Team Oreca dominated the GT2-class with their heavily modified Chrysler Viper GTS-Rs. One of these Vipers was purchased by Zakspeed to be entered on the Nürburgring VLN series to take advantage of the new, less restrictive rules for the 1999 season. Zakowski and his teammate dominated the 1999 season, winning every race, before the rules were altered for 2000 and the Porsche 996 GT3 showed up. The team won the 24 Hours Nürburgring again in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, against factory competition, they were disqualified due to a dispute over fuel tank size.

A company related to Zakspeed, Nitec, built the NASCAR-like V8-powered tube frame prototype cars of the V8Star Series Championship series which ran from 2001 to 2003. These identical cars used bodies modelled after road cars from Jaguar, BMW, Opel, Lexus and others. Zakspeed itself won in 2003 with Pedro Lamy in a Jaguar-bodied car.

In 2001, Zakspeed made a brief return to single-seaters with a foray into CART racing in the US in partnership with the long-established Forsythe Championship Racing.

In 2006, Zakspeed returned to the FIA GT Championship with the Saleen S7-R. The team also runs a racing school operating at the Nürburgring circuit.

==Superleague Formula==
In 2008, Zakspeed managed the Superleague Formula cars of Borussia Dortmund and Beijing Guoan, with the latter taking the overall title from such clubs as PSV Eindhoven, Liverpool F.C. and A.C. Milan. Dortmund took one win in the season and Beijing took three on the way to the title with driver Davide Rigon.

In 2009, Zakspeed managed Sporting CP (who won a race with Pedro Petiz) and R.S.C. Anderlecht.

<text>Lawrence Dominic McCarthy, VC (21 January 1892 – 25 May 1975) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Lawrence Dominic McCarthy was born in York, Western Australia, on 21 January 1892. The son of Florence McCarthy of Cork, Ireland, and his wife Anne (née Sherry), he was orphaned at a young age and was brought up at St Joseph&#x27;s Boys&#x27; Orphanage (later Clontarf) in Perth and educated in Catholic schools.

After completing his schooling, from the age of 13 he worked on a farm as an apprentice at Jennacubbine, near Northam. Later, he served with the 18th Light Horse, a Militia unit, for two and a half years before moving to Lion Mill, Perth. He subsequently worked as a contractor sawmiller, losing three fingers on his left hand in an accident.

==First World War==
===Gallipoli and the Western Front===
McCarthy was initially rejected due to his injuries when he attempted to join the Australian Imperial Force; however, he was later accepted after proving he had won a number of shooting competitions. Enlisted on 16 October 1914 as a private, he was subsequently posted to the 16th Battalion, joining the newly formed unit at Blackboy Hill Camp. His large build later earned him the nickname &quot;Fats&quot;. Sailing for Egypt in December, the battalion landed at Gallipoli on 26 April 1915 on the second day of the campaign against the Turkish. McCarthy remained on the peninsula until illness forced his evacuation in September. By then he had been promoted to sergeant. He returned to duty in November and was among the last in his battalion to leave Gallipoli on 20 December.

The 16th Battalion arrived in France in June 1916 where they took part in the fighting against the Germans at Pozières and Mouquet Farm in August. McCarthy was appointed company sergeant major in March 1917 and the following month was commissioned as a second lieutenant. The day after receiving his commission, McCarthy was wounded at Bullecourt and evacuated to England where he spent three months in hospital and convalescing. Rejoining his unit on 9 July, he was promoted to lieutenant on 1 November and was awarded the French Croix de guerre two days later. Between February and August 1918 he was posted the 13th Training Battalion at Tidworth, England where he trained troops, before rejoining his battalion in time for the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that began on 8 August.

===Victoria Cross action===

On 23 August 1918, McCarthy performed what was later described in the official history as being the most effective piece of individual fighting in the history of the AIF, next to Albert Jacka&#x27;s Military Cross-winning feat at Pozières. Near Madam Wood, east of Vermandovillers, France, the battalion was heavily opposed by well-posted German machine-guns. McCarthy, realizing the situation, dashed across the open ground with two men to the nearest post, where, having out-distanced his companions, he put the gun out of action, then continued fighting his way down the trench. Later, having been joined by one of his men, together they bombed their way along the trench until contact was established with an adjoining unit.

During this action McCarthy had killed 20 of the enemy, taken 50 prisoners and captured 5 machine-guns and 500 yards (460 m) of the German front. The battalion historian wrote that following McCarthy&#x27;s feat, &quot;the prisoners closed in on him from all sides ... and patted him on the back!&quot; For this McCarthy was awarded the Victoria Cross that, within his battalion and in some quarters of the London press, came to be known as the &quot;super-VC&quot;.

Ten days after the war ended, on 21 November 1918, McCarthy was evacuated to England with influenza, where he was subsequently informed that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross for his action. After recovering he rejoined his battalion on 7 January 1919, subsequently receiving the award from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1919.

==Later life==
McCarthy returned to Australia in December 1919, having married Florence Norville the previous January in London. McCarthy was demobilised in August 1920 and returned to Western Australia. Moving to Victoria in 1926 with his wife, he gained employment with the Sunshine Harvester Works as a commercial traveler and remained with them until 1934 when the company was forced to lay off staff during the Great Depression.

He subsequently found new work the following year with the Trustees, Executors &amp; Agency Co. in Melbourne, and worked for that company until his retirement in 1969. The couple&#x27;s only son, Lawrence, was killed in action fighting the Japanese on Bougainville on 20 May 1945.

==Death and legacy==
McCarthy died at the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg in Melbourne in May 1975 and was cremated with full military honours.

The Lawrence McCarthy Ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood has been named in his honour. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

<text>The Parlamentarischer Rat (German for &quot;Parliamentary Council&quot;) was the West German constituent assembly in Bonn that drafted and adopted the constitution of West Germany, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, promulgated on 23 May 1949.

==Convening==
The Council was implemented by the minister-presidents of the eleven states of Germany within the three Western Allied occupation zones and inaugurated on 1 September 1948. It included 70 state delegates selected by the &quot;Landtag&quot; parliaments specifically for this purpose (including five non-voting representatives of West Berlin), many of them state ministers, government officials or legal academics. The deputies could rely on a draft document prepared by the constitutional Herrenchiemsee convention held in August.

The Council was officially opened by North Rhine-Westphalia minister-president Karl Arnold as host. The second speaker was Hessian minister-president Christian Stock as current head of the Ministerial Conference of the Federal States. The site of the opening ceremony was at the great hall of the Museum Koenig in Bonn, a preliminary decision in view of the &quot;provisional&quot; capital of a West German state, which the minister-presidents at a convention in Düsseldorf on 11 October 1948 decided to locate in Bonn (instead of Frankfurt). The assembly elected the Christian Democratic politician Konrad Adenauer, former mayor of Cologne, its president. The regular sessions of the Parliamentary Council were held at the nearby Pedagogical Academy building.

The delegates of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) already formed a united faction with their Christian Social (CSU) colleagues from Bavaria, as did the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) together with the Hessian Liberal-Democratic Party and the Democratic People&#x27;s Party (DVP) from Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. The 65 voting members included 27 Christian Democrats, 27 Social Democrats (SPD) led by Carlo Schmid, and five Liberals under Theodor Heuss. In addition, the Communist Party, the German Party and the Centre Party each sent two delegates. Four of the 65 delegates were women: Elisabeth Selbert (SPD), Friederike Nadig (SPD), Helene Weber (CDU) and Helene Wessel (Centre). The SPD deputy Paul Löbe had served as President of the Reichstag parliament from 1925 until 1932, when he was succeeded by Hermann Göring.

==Proceedings==

The primary purpose of the Council was to prepare a new constitution for Germany, thereby drawing lessons from the failure of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism, in order to re-establish a federal state based upon a stable democracy, welfare and the &quot;Rechtsstaat&quot; maxim. The draft declared human dignity inviolable, and to respect and protect it the duty of all state authority. These basic principles were explicitly declared irreversible by the so-called eternity clause. To distinguish it, for instance, from the newly established People&#x27;s Republics behind the Iron Curtain, the draft laid stress on a parliamentary system and references related to notions separation of powers, all bound to the constitution. It included a charter of fundamental rights and the right of access to courts.

The Chancellor as head of government was authorized to draw up the guidelines of policies, while the powers of the President of Germany as head of state were limited. In consequence of the destructive motions in the former Reichstag, the draft implemented the constructive vote of no confidence, whereafter the Chancellor may only be removed from office by the Bundestag parliament if a prospective successor has the support of a majority. The concept of &quot;Streitbare Demokratie&quot; also included the implementation of the Federal Constitutional Court as an separate judicial body, in accordance with the theories of Hans Kelsen. Its preamble stated the obligation to achieve German unity and the draft also provided for the accession of &quot;other parts of Germany&quot;, as it was applied to the joining of the former Saar Protectorate in 1957 and German reunification in 1990. The Western Allies insisted on the special status of Berlin, which is why the Bundestag MPs from West Berlin were not entitled to vote.

The Council adopted the new constitution on 8 May 1949, with 53 votes for and 12 votes against, the Communist, German Party and Centre delegates voted against, as did six out of the eight CSU representatives. It also drafted the Election Law (&quot;Wahlgesetz&quot;) for the first Bundestag election of 1949 (which was later on replaced by the &quot;Bundeswahlgesetz&quot;). The draft was approved by the three Western Supreme Commanders on May 12, as did the state assemblies—except for the Bavarian &quot;Landtag&quot; for an assumed insufficient realization of the federalism principle, knowing that the consent of two thirds of the state parliaments were enough for the enactment. The Basic Law was then formally signed and promulgated on May 23. The Parliamentary Council disassembled once it had finished its purpose, i.e. after the ratification and the enactment of the first Election Law in preparation of the 1949 federal election, which among others the Basic Law had left it as a remaining task.

<text>Captain Frederick William Hedges (22 Nov 1896 – 29 May 1954) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with The Bedfordshire Regiment during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 24 October 1918, during the Battle of the Selle.

==Early life==
Frederick Hedges was born on 22 November 1896 at Ambala in India, the seventh of nine children of Mr and Mrs H.D. Hodges. His father was serving in the British Army as a bandmaster, having done so for many years. By 1901, the Hedges family was living in Hounslow, Middlesex. He was educated at Grove Road Boys&#x27; School, and Isleworth County School.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Hedges volunteered for the British Army and was posted as a rifleman to the 9th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles), with whom he would serve for the next few months. His service number at this point was 2182. The battalion was part of the 13th Infantry Brigade, 5th Division, and, in November 1914, it was sent to the Western Front in France where it served for several months, including during the First Battle of Ypres. Hedges suffered frostbite and was evacuated to England in January 1915 for treatment. He had recovered within a couple of months and returned to the London Regiment.
Hedges was commissioned into the Bedfordshire Regiment in July 1915 and after a period of training at Felixstowe, served as a musketry instructor for several months in England. However, in September 1916, he returned to the Western Front, this time to the 6th (Service) Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment. He fought in the Battle of the Ancre in November 1916 and in the Battle of Arras the following year, during which he was wounded in the right hand. After a period of treatment at Rouen, he was sent to England for further medical care at Portsmouth and then at Osbourne House at the Isle of Wight.

Hedges, by now a lieutenant (having been promoted to that rank in July 1917), did not return to the frontlines until September 1918, having served briefly as a machine gun instructor on recovering from his wounds. He was attached to the 6th Battalion, The Northamptonshire Regiment, as his original unit, the 6th Bedfords, had been disbanded. On 24 October 1918, the battalion was involved in the Battle of the Selle. Leading a company of the battalion near the village of Hecq, northeast of Bousies, Hedges, with his NCO, Sjt Fred Gibson, captured two machinegun posts that were holding up the advance. They took 14 prisoners. A few days later, during an engagement in the Mormal Forest, he was wounded in the head and shoulder. He was evacuated to England for treatment on 8 November 1918. 
For his actions on 24 October he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Hedge&#x27;s VC read:

Sjt Gibson was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his role in accompanying Hedges.

Following his recovery, he received his VC in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 15 May 1919. The next month, he was placed in command of a prisoner of war camp in Guildford. Not long afterwards, he married his fiancée, Mollie , in Hounslow, Middlesex. In late September, he was injured in a motorbike accident and suffered a fractured leg. He was discharged from the British Army before the end of the year.

==Later life==
After leaving military service, Hedges found employment with the Cornhill Insurance Company. He was instrumental in the setting up of a memorial to former students of his old school at Isleworth County who had been killed during the war and was also involved in the British Legion. In 1924, his first son, John Grosvenor Hedges, was born. During the Second World War, both father and son served in the Home Guard. However, in 1941, John died in a drowning accident on the Thames, aged just 17.

After the war, Hedges and his wife moved to Harrogate in Leeds where he was to run Cornhill&#x27;s office there. He was never at ease with the shift and he became affected by depression. On 29 May 1954, the anniversary of John&#x27;s death, he committed suicide, hanging himself at his home. His mental state had worsened since he had to take early retirement from his work. His remains were cremated.

==Victoria Cross==
After his death, Hedges&#x27; medals, which in addition to the VC, also included the 1914 Star, the Victory Medal, the British War Medal, and the 1937 and 1953 Coronation Medals, were loaned to the Leeds City Museum. They are now in the care of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, displayed at the gallery located in Wardown Park Museum, Luton, Bedfordshire.

<text>Thomas Hughes VC (10 November 1885 – 4 January 1942) was a British Army soldier, and Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Hughes was born 30 May 1885 in Corravoo near Castleblayney, County Monaghan. He moved to England in 1910 and lived at Hednesford, Staffordshire while he worked as a stable hand, and on a coal wharf at Cannock before enlisting in the army in November 1914.

He was 31 years old, and a private in the 6th Battalion, The Connaught Rangers, British Army during the First World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his action which took place during the Battle of the Somme.

On 3 September 1916 at Guillemont, France, Private Hughes was wounded in an attack but returned at once to the firing line after having his wounds dressed. Later, seeing a hostile machine-gun, he dashed out in front of his company, shot the gunner and, single-handed, captured the gun. Though again wounded, he brought back three or four prisoners.

He later achieved the rank of corporal. His wounds left him with difficulty walking and led to his being invalided out of the army in February 1918.

He returned to Ireland after the war to help run a family farm, later purchasing another farm with money locally collected for him. He suffered alcoholism and spent periods in the workhouse. He died in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan on 4 January 1942, aged 56. He never married but he had an illegitimate son, born in England.

He is buried in the cemetery attached to St Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in Broomfield, near Castleblayney, in County Monaghan.

His Victoria Cross is held by the National Army Museum, Chelsea, London.

<text>Nataliya Dmytruk (, alternate transliteration: Natalya Dmytruk) (born 1957 or 1958) is a former sign language interpreter on the Ukrainian state-run channel UT1 news broadcasts. Dmytruk became famous for refusing to translate the official script during a live broadcast on November 24, 2004 that announced Viktor Yanukovych as the winner of the presidential election. Instead of signing the official script, Dmytruk instead signed to viewers &quot;Our president is Viktor Yushchenko. Do not trust the results of the central election committee. They are all lies.&quot; Dmytruk&#x27;s act of defiance has been regarded as one of several catalysts for many Ukrainian journalists who subsequently rejected doctored news reports in favour of a more balanced reporting.

== Personal life ==
Dmytruk is the daughter of deaf parents and is the mother of two children, a son and daughter. Dmytruk both speaks and signs.

== Career ==

=== Act of courage ===
While working as a sign language interpreter at the Ukrainian state-run channel UT1, Dmytruk became known for a live news broadcast on November 24, 2004, when she refused to translate the official script that announced Viktor Yanukovych as the winner of the presidential election. Deviating from the official script followed by the voice announcer, Dmytruk instead signed to viewers, &quot;I am addressing everybody who is deaf in Ukraine. Our president is Viktor Yushchenko. Do not trust the results of the central election committee. They are all lies... And I am very ashamed to translate such lies to you. Maybe you will see me again.&quot;

Her solo rebellion sparked a stop-work meeting by 250 of her newsroom colleagues who made a broader stand for truth. Hundreds of her colleagues at UT-1 who were inspired by Dmytruk&#x27;s action confronted the network&#x27;s owners, chanting, &quot;No more lies!&quot; Within days UT1 had changed to a balanced reporting style. Following her act, many other news reporters in the broadcast media run or controlled by the state or the oligarchs who supported Yanukovych refused to participate in the production of the doctored news reports. Within a few days the overall political climate in Ukrainian media changed dramatically towards a more balanced coverage, while prior to these events the domination of the media is considered one of the ways Yanukovych influenced the vote.

&quot;Without telling anyone, I just went in and did what my conscience told me to do.&quot; Hours after her UT1 co-workers announced on-air their intentions to report fairly, reporters at Channel 1+1 made a similar announcement. These changes were significant, because until then, most media outlets in Ukraine were influenced in some capacity by the government.

=== Aftermath ===
The widespread protests led to the Ukrainian Supreme Court declaring the election invalid. In the court-ordered new election a month later, on December 26, Yushchenko was declared the winner with 52% of the vote to 44% for Yanukovych. &quot;(See 2004 Ukrainian presidential election.)&quot;

Despite Dmytruk&#x27;s efforts, changes spearheaded at UT1 by a new boss eliminated sign-language services, forcing Dmytruk onto extended leave. She later resigned and joined rival Channel 1+1.

== Awards ==

* Dmytruk was invited to the Freedom House Champions of Freedom gala in Bratislava, Slovak Republic on February 24, 2005 where Dmytruk and the other guests met privately with US President George W. Bush.
* In 2005, Nataliya Dmytruk, together with another Ukrainian Olena Prytula, were given the annual International John Aubuchon Freedom of the Press Award of the National Press Club. 
* On April 25, 2005 Dmytruk and three other Ukrainian women (Oksana Horbunova, Oksana Yarosh and Lyudmila Merlyan) received the Fern Holland Award at the Vital Voices Global Partnership&#x27;s fifth annual ceremony which honors women from around the world who have made a difference.

<text>Samuel Lewis Honey, (9 February 1894 – 30 September 1918) was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, during the First World War. He had already been awarded the Military Medal and Distinguished Conduct Medal for actions earlier in the war.

==Early life==
Samuel Lewis Honey was born on 9 February 1894 in Conn in Ontario to Reverend George Edward Honey and Metta Blaisdell. His father, originally from Boston, was a Methodist who moved his family from town to town as he took up a succession of ministries. Honey, who was known to his family as &quot;Lew&quot;, attended schools in Drayton, Princeton and London, all in Ontario.

When he was 17, Honey taught at schools on the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Ontario. He then resumed his own education, attending Walkerton High School from which he graduated in mid-1914 with honours in several subjects. He returned to teaching for a brief period while planning to enter Victoria College at University of Toronto. However, with the First World War underway, he decided to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force.

==First World War==
Honey enlisted on 22 January 1915 and was posted to the 34th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force as a private. The battalion departed for England in October 1915, and by this time Honey had been promoted to sergeant. While in England he served as a physical fitness instructor, and briefly served with the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), CEF before being transferred to the 78th Battalion, which was engaged on the Western Front.
He earned the Military Medal for his actions in a raid on German trenches on 22 February 1917, providing cover for both his squad and another in the face of heavy grenade fire, having cleared a communications trench. Afterwards, Honey wrote that his entire party deserved recognition as well. In April 1917, he fought in the Battle of Vimy Ridge, earning the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for leadership and maintaining morale in the face of extremely heavy fire. He was modest about his DCM, stating in correspondence that he was simply lucky.

Recommended for a commission after the battle, Honey was subsequently selected for officer training. Sent to England, he spent time at Bramshott Camp as an instructor before taking an officer&#x27;s course at Bexhill. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in October 1917 and returned to the 78th Battalion for duty.

In late September 1918 at Bourlon Wood, the 78th Battalion participated in the Battle of the Canal du Nord (a part of Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days). During the fighting on 27 September, Honey had to take command of his company due to all the other officers becoming casualties. He led the company in clearing German strongpoints and defending a number of counterattacks. Towards the end of the battle, he was wounded and died on 30 September 1918. He was buried in Pas de Calais in France, at the Queant Communal Cemetery.

For his actions during the Battle of the Canal du Nord, Honey was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC, gazetted in early January 1919, read:

There was no formal presentation of the VC to Honey&#x27;s relatives, at their request. Instead, the medal was sent to Canada by the War Office. In turn, the Governor General forwarded it on by mail to Honey&#x27;s father. Plaques to his memory exist in several locations; Wescott United Church in Conn, Valour Place in Cambridge, Ontario, and the Galt Armoury.

==Medals==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Canada, alongside his Distinguished Conduct Medal, Military Medal, British War Medal and Victory Medal.

<doc id="1219592" wikidata="Q1983703" url="?curid=1219592" title="1973 World Series">
<text>The 1973 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1973 season. The 70th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion (and defending World Series champion) Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion New York Mets. The Athletics won the series in seven games for their second of three consecutive World Series titles and their seventh championship overall. 

The Mets won the NL East division by games over the St. Louis Cardinals, then defeated the Cincinnati Reds, three games to two, in the NL Championship Series. The Athletics won the AL West division by six games over the Kansas City Royals, then defeated the Baltimore Orioles, three games to two, in the AL Championship Series.

This was the first World Series in which all weekday games started at night. This was the last World Series in which each team produced and sold its own game programs for its home games.

Reggie Jackson was named the World Series MVP. Jackson batted .310 with seven hits and six RBIs and a home run and scored three runs.

==Background==
===New York Mets===

The 1973 Mets&#x27; .509 season winning percentage is the lowest posted by any pennant winner in major league history. Injuries plagued the team throughout the season.

The team got off to a promising 4–0 start, and went .600 for the month of April. Before long, however, the team was soon beset with injuries and fell in standing, just as with their previous season. Stumbling through the summer in last place, the Mets got healthy and hot in September, ultimately winning the division with a mere 82 victories, games ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals. This marked the only time between 1970 and 1980 that neither their rival Philadelphia Phillies, nor the Pittsburgh Pirates, won the division.

At 82–79, the 1973 New York Mets had the worst record of any team to play in a World Series. They had only the ninth-best record in the 24-team major leagues, behind the Oakland A&#x27;s, the Cincinnati Reds (who they beat in the National League Championship Series), the Baltimore Orioles (who were defeated by Oakland in the American League Championship Series), the Los Angeles Dodgers, the San Francisco Giants, the Boston Red Sox, the Detroit Tigers and the Kansas City Royals (none of whom made the postseason).

The 1973 New York Mets had the lowest winning percentage (now the second-lowest) of any postseason team (the San Diego Padres finished 82–80 in 2005).
1969 holdovers Bud Harrelson, Jerry Grote, Wayne Garrett, Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Tug McGraw and Cleon Jones joined forces with the Mets&#x27; farm-system alumni John Milner and Jon Matlack and trade-acquired Rusty Staub, Félix Millán, and Willie Mays, now 42 years old. Don Hahn and Mays alternated in center field, although they both batted right-handed.

The Mets&#x27; NLCS opponents, an imposing Cincinnati Reds squad that posted 99 victories during the regular season, were the favorite to return to the Series for a second consecutive year. (The Reds had fallen to the A&#x27;s in the previous year&#x27;s Series.) The 1973 NLCS went the full five games, and featured a now-famous brawl between Pete Rose and Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson. In the end, the Mets continued their improbable rise and bumped Rose and the rest of the mighty Reds from the playoffs.

Willie Mays recorded the final hit of his career in Game 2. In four World Series (1951, 1954, 1962, and 1973), Mays did not hit a single home run. He hit only one in the postseason, during the 1971 NLCS. In Game 2, Mays slipped and fell while chasing a ball hit by Deron Johnson, allowing him to reach second base.

===Oakland Athletics===

The Oakland Athletics secured the pennant by overcoming the Baltimore Orioles in the 1973 ALCS. The Athletics, defending champions, still possessed a formidable lineup headed by a healthy Reggie Jackson, (.293, 32 HR, 117 RBI, 22 stolen bases) who would be named league MVP in 1973. Jackson was joined in the lineup by standouts like third baseman Sal Bando, the fine defensive outfielder Joe Rudi, the speedy shortstop Bert Campaneris, and the A&#x27;s catcher, 1972 World Series hero Gene Tenace. The pitching staff featured three 20-game winners, Ken Holtzman (21–13), Catfish Hunter (21–5), and Vida Blue (20–9), with Rollie Fingers (22 saves, 1.92) serving as the A&#x27;s ace relief pitcher.

The Athletics offered entertainment both on and off the field in 1973; their brightly colored uniforms were the perfect metaphor for a team notable for clashing personalities. The stars engaged regularly in conflicts with each other and with owner Charles O. Finley.

With the designated hitter rule in effect for the first time in 1973, American League pitchers seldom batted during the regular season. They were, however, expected to take their turn at the plate during each game of this Series. So it was that a man who had played no offensive role during the regular season came to make a key batting contribution for the Athletics during the Series. With some extra batting practice, A&#x27;s pitcher Ken Holtzman would stroke a double that helped the Athletics to win Game 1 – and another double that helped them secure the deciding seventh game.

This Series was also notable for an incident where Finley attempted to &quot;fire&quot; second-baseman Mike Andrews for his errors in Game 2 (see below). Commissioner Bowie Kuhn would reinstate Andrews and fine Finley. Despite the hostility of the Oakland players toward the team&#x27;s owner, the Athletics would be the first to repeat as World Champions since the 1961–62 New York Yankees. Oakland manager Dick Williams resigned after the Series was over, having had enough of owner Charles O. Finley&#x27;s interference.

Oakland reliever Darold Knowles became the first pitcher to appear in every game of a seven-game World Series.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
The Mets and A&#x27;s opened the Series in Oakland with Jon Matlack and Ken Holtzman as the Game 1 starters (Matlack, with a 14–16 record during the 1973 season, is one of only four pitchers in history to start Game 1 of a World Series after a regular season losing record). Willie Mays started in place of the injured Rusty Staub and batted third in what turned out to be his final big league start.

In the third, pitcher Holtzman doubled and scored when Bert Campaneris hit a routine grounder that inexplicably bounced between Mets second baseman&#x27;s Félix Millán&#x27;s legs. Campaneris then stole second and scored on a single to right by Joe Rudi. The Mets came up with a run in the fourth on an RBI single by John Milner that scored Cleon Jones. Holtzman, Rollie Fingers, and Darold Knowles then shut the door on the Mets offense; Knowles earned the save.

===Game 2===
Game 2, eventually won by the Mets 10–7 in 12 innings, set a new record for the longest game in Series history at four hours and 13 minutes. Along with blinding sunshine &quot;turn{ing} every fly ball into adventure&quot; (especially for a 42-year-old Willie Mays), Curt Gowdy described the contest in the official MLB 1973 Fall Classic highlight film as one of the &quot;longest and weirdest games in World Series history&quot;.

Vida Blue opposed Jerry Koosman on the mound, but neither pitched well. In the first inning, the A&#x27;s jumped on Koosman for two runs as the flyball adventures began. With one out, Joe Rudi reached second on a fly ball to left that Cleon Jones lost in the sun as he drifted to the warning track and the ball dropped in front of him. Rudi scored when the next batter, Sal Bando, hit a ball to right center that Don Hahn misplayed and allowed to bounce to the wall as Bando reached third. After Gene Tenace walked with two outs, Bando scored on a Jesús Alou double. The A&#x27;s scored again in the second on Joe Rudi&#x27;s single scoring the ubiquitous Bert Campaneris, who had tripled. The Mets got home runs from Cleon Jones and Wayne Garrett in the second and third innings, respectively.

The A&#x27;s were still up 3–2 going into the sixth when things got even more strange. With one out and two on, Horacio Piña relieved Blue and promptly hit Jerry Grote with his first pitch, loading the bases. Don Hahn then drove home Cleon Jones with an infield hit and Bud Harrelson followed with an RBI single to put the Mets ahead 4–3. Jim Beauchamp then pinch-hit for reliever Harry Parker and hit a comebacker to the mound. Darold Knowles, who had relieved Pina, fielded the ball but lost his balance hurrying the throw home and threw wildly past Ray Fosse on the attempted force play. Two more Mets runs scored for a 6–3 lead.

Reggie Jackson had an RBI double in the seventh to make it 6–4. In the ninth, Deron Johnson, batting for Blue Moon Odom, lifted a fly ball to center that Willie Mays lost in the sun and fell down while chasing. Johnson reached second. Allan Lewis pinch-ran and scored on a single by Jackson after Sal Bando walked. Gene Tenace singled in Bando to tie it.

The Mets threatened in the 10th when Harrelson led off with a single. Tug McGraw bunted for a sacrifice and Rollie Fingers threw to second, but Harrelson ran with the pitch and was safe. McGraw was retired on the relay to first. Harrelson went to third when Garrett bounced a high grounder to Tenace at first and reached when Tenace&#x27;s throw pulled Fingers off the bag. Harrelson then tagged and attempted to score on a Félix Millán fly to left. Harrelson appeared to have sidestepped Fosse&#x27;s tag at the plate (and replays from NBC&#x27;s broadcast clearly showed Fosse missed him), but he was called out by umpire Augie Donatelli, prompting a heated outburst from Harrelson, on-deck batter Willie Mays, and manager Yogi Berra.

The game stayed knotted at 6–6 until the top of the 12th. Harrelson led off with a double and went to third when McGraw reached first on a bunt that Sal Bando overran. With two outs, Mays drove in Harrelson with a single that would turn out to be the final hit and RBI of his storied career. It gave the Mets a 7–6 lead.

After Jones walked to load the bases, John Milner grounded to second baseman Mike Andrews, but the ball went through his legs. McGraw and Mays scored to make the lead 9–6. The next batter, Grote, hit another grounder to Andrews, but his throw to first pulled Tenace off the bag (though NBC replays showed Tenace kept his foot on the bag). Jones scored to make it 10–6.

The A&#x27;s added a run in the bottom of the inning when Jackson reached third as Mays lost yet another fly ball in the sun and Alou singled him home, but Andrews&#x27; errors proved too much to overcome. McGraw, who pitched six innings total, earned the win, and George Stone the save and the Mets evened the series.

A&#x27;s owner Charlie Finley was furious at Andrews&#x27; 12th-inning miscues; he proceeded to punish Andrews (and further alienate A&#x27;s manager Dick Williams) by forcing Andrews to sign a false affidavit saying he was injured, thereby sidelining him for the remainder of the Series.

===Game 3===
Game 3 matched up Tom Seaver and Catfish Hunter. Hunter had trouble early on when Wayne Garrett homered to right and Félix Millán scored on a wild pitch, but then found his rhythm. Seaver kept the A&#x27;s off the board until the sixth, when Sal Bando and Gene Tenace broke through with consecutive doubles that delivered a run and cut the Met lead to 2–1. Joe Rudi came up with another clutch hit in the eighth when he singled in Bert Campaneris to tie the game. In the bottom of the tenth, Willie Mays would make his final appearance in an MLB game, unsuccessfully pinch-hitting for Tug McGraw. Campaneris delivered the game-winning RBI in the 11th when he singled off Harry Parker to score Ted Kubiak. Rollie Fingers got the save.

In this game, manager Dick Williams and the A&#x27;s players wore a piece of athletic tape with the number 17, which was Mike Andrews&#x27; uniform number, affixed to their uniforms in protest of Charlie Finley&#x27;s actions in the previous game concerning Andrews.

===Game 4===
Prior to this game, MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered Charlie Finley to re-instate Mike Andrews to the active playoff roster, citing his illegal actions after Game 2.

A&#x27;s starter Ken Holtzman couldn&#x27;t make it out of the first inning after Rusty Staub smashed a three-run homer to left-center. Blue Moon Odom relieved and gave up a two-run single to Staub in a three-run Mets fourth. Jon Matlack got the win by pitching eight innings of three-hit ball. Ray Sadecki pitched the ninth and got the save.

Andrews entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the eighth, prompting a standing ovation from the Mets&#x27; home crowd, in a display of defiance toward Finley. Andrews grounded out in what would be his last major league at-bat.

===Game 5===
Game 5 was a rematch up of Vida Blue and Jerry Koosman. This time, both pitchers threw well. John Milner had an RBI single in the second, and Don Hahn&#x27;s triple to center field scored Jerry Grote with the second Mets run in the sixth. Koosman pitched well and got the win, with a save from Tug McGraw.

===Game 6===
The A&#x27;s won, thanks to the clutch pitching of Catfish Hunter (who outdueled Tom Seaver), who was pitching on short rest, and the timely hitting of Reggie Jackson. Jackson doubled and drove in Joe Rudi in the first inning and doubled in Sal Bando in the third to give Oakland a 2–0 lead. In the eighth inning, the Mets threatened, knocking Hunter out of the game after Ken Boswell singled in a run. Reliever Darold Knowles put out the fire by striking out Rusty Staub on three pitches with two men on base. In the bottom half of the inning, the A&#x27;s added an insurance run when Jackson singled, advanced to third on center fielder Don Hahn&#x27;s error, and scored on Jesús Alou&#x27;s sacrifice fly. Rollie Fingers got the save in the ninth inning to force a seventh game.

===Game 7===
Ken Holtzman outdueled Jon Matlack in a rematch of the Game 4 starters. The third inning proved to be the difference, as Holtzman lined a one-out double off Matlack to left, his second of the Series after not batting at all during the season. Matlack then surrendered a two-run opposite-field homer to Bert Campaneris (Oakland&#x27;s first home run of the series), and then another two-run blast to Reggie Jackson later in the inning, giving the A&#x27;s a 4–0 lead and Holtzman all the runs he needed. The Mets came back with two runs after Oakland increased their lead to 5–0 in the fifth inning, but it was not enough. Campaneris snagged a Wayne Garrett pop fly to end the series; and Jackson was named the World Series MVP.

In the third inning, Gene Tenace walked for the 11th time tying the Series record set by Babe Ruth of the Yankees in 1926. In the seventh inning, Wayne Garrett struck out for the 11th time tying the Series record set by Eddie Mathews of the Milwaukee Braves in 1958 (later broken in 1980 when Willie Wilson of the Royals struck out 12 times). Darold Knowles got the save and became the only pitcher to appear in all seven games of a seven-game World Series until Brandon Morrow in the 2017 World Series.

The final out was recorded at 4:07 p.m. Pacific Time, making this the last World Series (through 2021) to end in daylight.

Vern Hoscheit, a coach with the A&#x27;s in 1973, would win a World Series with the Mets as a coach in .

==Composite line score==
1973 World Series (4–3): Oakland A&#x27;s (A.L.) over New York Mets (N.L.)

This was the third consecutive year in which the World Series went a full seven games and the champions were outscored; this occurred again two years later in 1975.

<text>David Finlay VC (29 January 1893 – 21 January 1916) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Finlay was the son of a shepherd named George Finlay and his wife Susan Small. He was 22 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 2nd Battalion, The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 May 1915 near Rue du Bois, France, Lance-Corporal Finlay led a bombing party of 12 men in the attack until 10 of them had fallen. He then ordered the two survivors to crawl back and he himself went to the assistance of a wounded man and carried him over a distance of 100 yards of fire-swept ground into cover, quite regardless of his own safety.

Finlay was later promoted to the rank of sergeant. He was killed in action in Mesopotamia on 21 January 1916 and is remembered on the Basra Memorial.

==Further information==
Finlay is commemorated on the war memorial in Moonzie Kirkyard in Fife. There is now a memorial stone in the children&#x27;s play park in the north end of Guardbridge his home village. The village also has a recently added street named after him.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Black Watch Museum, Balhousie Castle, Perth, Scotland.

<text>Colonel William Eagleson Gordon, VC, CBE (4 May 1866 – 10 March 1941) was a Scottish British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He is the older brother of Archibald Alexander Gordon, who received the Legion of Honour and Order of Leopold.

==Early military career==
Gordon was born at Bridge of Allan in 1866, and joined the militia in 1886 as lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Gordon Highlanders on 6 June 1888, promoted to lieutenant on 1 September 1891, and took part in the Chitral Expedition with the 1st battalion of his regiment in 1895. Two years later they served in the Tirah Campaign on the North West Frontier of British India 1897–1898, during which he was promoted to captain on 19 October 1897.

He served as adjutant of the 1st battalion from 21 January 1899 and throughout the Second Boer War (1899–1902), when the battalion was posted to South Africa. They were part of the force sent to relieve the siege of Kimberley, and saw action at the Battle of Magersfontein in December 1899, where Gordon was wounded. He then served in the Orange Free State from February to May 1900, and took part in the battles of Paardeberg (February 1900), Poplar Grove, Driefontein (March 1900), Hontnek, Vet River and Hand River. Transferring to Transvaal, the battalion was again in action at Doornkop in May 1900, where they suffered severe losses, then took part in the battles of Belfast and Lydenburg (August 1900). The battalion stayed in South Africa throughout the war, which ended with the Peace of Vereeniging in June 1902. Four months later 475 officers and men of the 1st battalion left Cape Town on the SS &quot;Salamis&quot; in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton in late October, when the battalion was posted to Glasgow.

===Citation===
Gordon was 34 years old, and a captain in the 1st Battalion, The Gordon Highlanders during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place near Krugersdorp, South Africa for which he (together with Captain David Reginald Younger) was awarded the VC:

His Victoria Cross is on display at the Gordon Highlanders Museum, Aberdeen, Scotland.

==Later military career==
Gordon was brevetted lieutenant colonel in the Gordon Highlanders in 1907. Gordon also served as an aide-de-camp to King George V, having been appointed to that position in October 1913.

On 4 May 1923 Gordon was placed on retired pay having achieved the rank of major although as previously noted he was a brevet lieutenant colonel.

<text>Frederick William Holmes VC (15 September 1889 – 22 October 1969) also known as F. W. Holmes, was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Holmes was born on 27 September 1889 in Bermondsey, London, England. He was educated at the local school run by the London School Board. He joined the British Army on 28 September 1907, the day after his 18th birthday. In May 1914, he married Violet Imelda ( Daley); she was known as Margaret. After seven years service, he transferred to the Army Reserve. Only two weeks later, in August 1914, he was called up for active service following the outbreak of the First World War.

===Victoria Cross===
Holmes was 24 years old, and a lance corporal in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the Battle of Le Cateau for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC):

On the first day of the Battle of Le Cateau, Holmes came across Bugler H. Norman Hawthorne, who was lying in the open with two broken legs. He proceeded to pick Hawthorne up and carried him on his back until he reached the stretcher bearers, two miles behind the trenches. He then ran back to the frontline. He returned to his battalion only to find &quot;a scene of carnage&quot;, with much of the men &quot;killed or wounded and a gun in danger of being captured by German forces&quot;. A wounded artilleryman asked Holmes if he could ride, as all the drivers were dead and someone had to guide the six horses to take the 18-pounder gun to safety. He limbered up the gun, placed the wounded artilleryman on one of the horses, and drove the artillery gun team away from the front line until they were out of range of the German artillery. Unfortunately, the injured man fell off somewhere in the dark and was lost. Eventually, on the second day of the battle, Holmes and his gun team reached the rearguard of a retiring artillery column. His story was first met with suspicion by the unit&#x27;s major but was verified after a while and he became the battery&#x27;s guest.

Following the events of the Battle of Le Cateau, on 30 August 1914, Holmes rejoined &#x27;A&#x27; Company of his battalion. However, in October 1914, he was seriously wounded in the ankle during a counter-attack; this resulted in the army doctors at the dressing station wishing to amputate his leg but he refused. He was instead repatriated to a hospital in England and then on Aldershot to recuperate. During his convalescence, Holmes was awarded the French Médaille Militaire and received notice that he was to be awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the United Kingdom&#x27;s highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy. He was also mentioned by Sir John French in his despatch, dated 8 October 1914. On 13 January 1915, he attended Buckingham Palace where he received his VC from King George V.

===Later service===
In October 1915, having recovered from his leg injury, Holmes joined the 1st Battalion, Green Howards and was promoted to sergeant. In December 1915, he was posted to India with his regiment. On 14 March 1917, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Green Howards, thereby becoming an officer. He was soon attached to 9th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment. In July 1917, he was posted to Mesopotamia. There he suffered an accident during which he fractured his skull and was repatriated back to England in January 1918. 

After recovering from his second major injury of the war, he was promoted to lieutenant on 14 September 1918. He was assigned to the Infantry Record Office in October 1918. On 4 April 1919, he was gazetted under special appointments Class HH. He also served in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence. He relinquished the special appointment on 1 April 1921, having ceased to be employed by a Record Office. He retired from the British Army on 20 August 1921 due to ill health. 

In addition to his Victoria Cross and &quot;Médaille Militaire&quot;, he ended his war service with the 1914 Star with Mons clasp, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal with Mentioned in Despatches oak leaf.

===Later life===
After leaving the army, he settled in London with his wife and at least one child. He and his wife would go on to have a total of seven children together. He attempted to set up his own business but this failed and he sold his medals in the 1920s. On 27 September 1939, he reached the age limit of liability for call up and so ceased to belong to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. However, during the Second World War, he voluntarily once more became a British Army officer and served in a number of administrative appointments in the United Kingdom until ill health led to his discharge in June 1943. He then served with the Observer Corps until the end of the war. By 1954, he was living in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. 

Having emigrated to Port Augusta, Australia in 1960, he broke one leg and then the other, leaving him disabled in the early 1960s. He died on 22 October 1969 in Port Augusta. He was cremated at the Stirling District Crematorium, Adelaide. His ashes are interred in the Stirling North Garden Cemetery, Port Augusta, alongside his wife who predeceased him by one year.

==Indian rope trick==

In 1917, Holmes, who was a Lieutenant at the time, stated that whilst on his veranda with a group of officers in Kirkee, he had observed the Indian rope trick being performed by an old man and young boy. The boy climbed the rope, balanced himself and then descended. The old man tapped the rope and it collapsed. This demonstration did not include the disappearance of the boy. In February 1919, Holmes presented a photograph he had taken of the trick at a meeting with members of The Magic Circle. It was examined by Robert Elliot, who stated it was not a demonstration of the Indian rope trick but an example of a balancing trick on a bamboo pole. Elliot noted that &quot;the tapering of the pole is an absolutely clear feature and definitely shows that it was not a rope.&quot; Holmes later admitted this, however, the photograph was reproduced by the press in several magazines and newspapers as proof the trick had been successfully demonstrated. Although discredited, the photograph is considered to be the first ever taken of the trick.

<text>Edward Lawson VC (11 April 1873 – 2 July 1955) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was a private in the 1st Battalion, The Gordon Highlanders, British Army during the Tirah Campaign when the following deed took place on 20 October 1897 on the Dargai Heights, for which he was awarded the VC:
Private Lawson continued to serve with his regiment until 1902. He had a further period of military service serving as a sergeant in the Northern Cyclist Battalion before and during the First World War.
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum in Aberdeen, Scotland.

There are two memorials to Edward Lawson in Newcastle upon Tyne. The first is a bench dedicated to him in Old Eldon Square by the war memorial. The second is a memorial to Newcastle&#x27;s Victoria Cross recipients outside the Discovery Museum in the city&#x27;s west end.

Sometime after The First World War, Edward Lawson lived with his family in Parson&#x27;s Avenue, Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, having moved from the Heaton area of Newcastle upon Tyne.

<doc id="1219612" wikidata="Q6525453" url="?curid=1219612" title="Leonard Keysor">
<text>Leonard Maurice Keysor, VC (also known as &quot;Keyzor&quot; or &quot;Kyezor&quot;) (3 November 1885 – 12 October 1951) was a British-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in England, Keysor emigrated to Australia shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. He enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force in August 1914 and served in Egypt before landing at Gallipoli, Turkey at the beginning of the campaign. On 7 August 1915 at Lone Pine, while serving as an acting lance-corporal, 29-year-old Keysor performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Later in the war he took part in the fighting in France, serving in the trenches along the Western Front. He would later achieve the rank of lieutenant before being discharged from the army on medical grounds at the end of the war.

Keysor remained in Australia until early 1919 working as a clerk in Sydney, New South Wales before returning to England where he began a career in business. On the outbreak of the Second World War he attempted to rejoin the military but was deemed medically unfit and was rejected. He died in 1951 suffering from cancer.

==Early life==
Leonard Maurice Keysor was born Leonard Maurice Kyezor on 3 November 1885 in Maida Vale, London. He was the third of five children of Benjamin Kyezor, a Jewish clock importer, and Julia Benjamin. Keysor was educated at Townley Castle in Ramsgate. After completing his studies, Keysor travelled to Canada in 1904 where he remained for a period of ten years before emigrating to Australia in 1914 where his brother Stanley and sister Madge were living. He undertook clerical work in Sydney, New South Wales. He was the cousin of British actress and comedienne, Rita Webb.

==Military career==
Keysor had only been in Australia for about three months when the First World War broke out. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 18 August 1914 as a private and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, which was forming at Randwick. On 18 October 1914 he embarked for overseas service among the first contingent. Initially he served in Egypt where the Australians were involved in the defence of the Suez Canal against the Turks, but on 25 April 1915, he landed at Gallipoli where he took part in the subsequent fighting on the peninsula. On 20 June 1915 he was promoted to lance corporal, before taking part in the Battle of Lone Pine in August.

It was during the course of this battle that Keysor performed the actions that led to him receiving the Victoria Cross. Early in the morning on 6 August 1915 the 1st Battalion carried out a diversionary attack at Lone Pine and after heavy fighting that lasted almost the entire day they managed to capture the Turkish trenches. After this more fighting would continue around the position for the next three days as the Turks attempted to regain the position. The fighting was carried out at close range, using bayonets and improvised grenades and bombs. Over the course of about 50 hours on 7–8 August, Keysor continually risked his life to pick up the Turkish grenades as they were thrown into the trenches and throw them back. Later, despite being wounded and ordered to seek medical attention, Keysor continued to remain in the line, volunteering to throw bombs for another company.

After the battle was over Keysor was evacuated from Gallipoli suffering enteric fever. He eventually rejoined the 1st Battalion after they had been transferred to France in early 1916. In March 1916 Keysor took part in the Battle of Pozières. In November 1916 he was transferred to the 42nd Battalion and promoted to the rank of sergeant on 1 December. On 13 January 1917 he was commissioned and promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. Six months later he was promoted to lieutenant. On 28 March 1918 Keysor was wounded and was evacuated from the line before returning to take part in the fighting at Villers-Bretonneux, where he was gassed on 26 May 1918.

In October 1918 when manpower levels in the AIF reached critical level, Keysor returned to Australia to head up a recruiting campaign. He was discharged from the army on medical grounds on 12 December 1918.

==Later life==
Following the end of the war, Keysor resided in Sydney from 1918 until February 1919 during which time he worked as a clerk when he returned to England. On 8 July 1920 he married Gladys Benjamin. After this he went into the family business importing clocks.

In 1927 Keysor re-enacted his exploits at Gallipoli in the film &quot;For Valour&quot;, during which he was injured. He remained on the Australian Military Forces list of inactive reserve officers, however, in 1939 when the Second World War began Keysor attempted to rejoin the military, but was rejected on medical grounds.

He died of cancer on 12 October 1951. He was survived by his wife and their daughter Joan. In 1977 Keysor&#x27;s Victoria Cross was purchased by the Returned Services League. It is now displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

In Australia in September 2014 his great niece Keira Quinn Lockyer published his biography &quot;Kyezor VC, Gallipoli&#x27;s Quiet Hero&quot;.

<doc id="1219614" wikidata="Q1984700" url="?curid=1219614" title="1972 World Series">
<text>The 1972 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1972 season. The 69th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League champion Oakland Athletics and the National League champion Cincinnati Reds. The Athletics won in seven games for their sixth World Series championship . It was the first World Series championship for the Athletics since 1930.

This was the first World Series in which both teams wore pullover uniforms, a style that remained the norm until 1982, after which at least one team in the fall classic would wear them until 1990, when the Cincinnati Reds wore them. Coincidentally both this World Series and the 1990 World Series featured the same two teams, the Athletics and the Reds, both far different results. The A&#x27;s won this one in a hard fought seven games, while the Reds swept the defending champion A&#x27;s in four games in 1990.

==Background==

The Athletics won the American League West division by games over the Chicago White Sox, then defeated the Detroit Tigers three games to two in the American League Championship Series. The Cincinnati Reds won the National League West division by games over both the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros. The Reds dethroned the defending World Series champion Pittsburgh Pirates three games to two in the National League Championship Series, marking the first year in which an LCS series in either league went the full five games since divisional play was introduced in . The Reds [] won one fewer game than the Pirates [] during the strike-reduced regular season and became the first team in MLB history to reach the World Series without having the best record in its respective league. In each of the first six League Championship Series, the team with the better record advanced to the World Series. (The Athletics&#x27; () had the best record in the American League in 1972, but the AL pennant winner the next three seasons did not.)

This was Cincinnati&#x27;s second trip to the World Series in three years, previously falling to Baltimore in five games in 1970. It was Oakland&#x27;s first-ever trip to the Series, and the first for the franchise since 1931, when the team was located in Philadelphia.

This was a matchup of the two premier MLB dynasties of the 1970s, with the Reds winning two World Series (1975–76) in four WS appearances, while the Athletics won three straight (1972–74). Iconoclastic club owner Charlie Finley&#x27;s &quot;Swingin&#x27; A&#x27;s&quot; featured day-glo uniforms, white shoes, much facial hair, colorful nicknames, and explosive personalities, while &quot;The Big Red Machine&quot; was a more traditional franchise with a more traditional look (including a facial-hair ban)—and an everyday lineup with three future Hall of Famers as well as all-time hits king, Pete Rose. The Series was dubbed &quot;The Hairs vs. the Squares.&quot;

Oakland played the Series without its star outfielder Reggie Jackson, who was injured (pulled hamstring) stealing home in the second inning of the final game of the ALCS at Detroit on Left-handed reliever Darold Knowles was also missing for the Athletics, breaking his thumb on September 27, less than three weeks before the Series opener.

With Jackson out, the Athletics were decided underdogs. George Hendrick was inserted into center field for Jackson. And while Hendrick only went 2-for-15 (.133 avg.), unheralded catcher Gene Tenace stepped up. Tenace had a poor regular season, hitting only .225 with five home runs. He was even worse in the AL Championship series against Detroit, going 1 for 17 (.059), although his one hit drove in the go-ahead run in Game 5. In the World Series however, Tenace was spectacular, hitting four home runs equaling the World Series mark set by Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Hank Bauer. He also had nine RBI in the Series—no other Oakland player had more than one. Tenace was voted World Series MVP.

By contrast, the stellar Oakland pitching kept the middle of the Reds lineup quiet for most of the series. Johnny Bench (.270 avg., 40 HR, 125 RBI, NL MVP), Tony Pérez (.283 avg., 21 HR, 90 RBI), and Denis Menke (9 HR, 50 RBI), combined for only two homers and five RBI the entire Series. Perez did lead both teams with 10 hits and a .435 batting average, but all 10 hits were singles. It didn&#x27;t help that the Reds&#x27; &quot;table-setters,&quot; Pete Rose and Joe Morgan were a combined 1 for 28 through the first four games, when the Reds lost three of those games.

The teams were fairly equal statistically, each club totaling 46 hits with the same .209 batting average (the combined batting averages were the lowest recorded in a 7-game World Series). The Reds outscored the Athletics by five runs, but all four of their losses were by a single run. Six of the seven games in the series were decided by one run, marking perhaps the most closely contested World Series in history.

==Summary==

: postponed from October 17 due to rain

==Matchups==

===Game 1===
Oakland jumped out to a one-game series lead behind catcher Gene Tenace, who hit a home run in each of his first two at-bats. Tenace became the first player ever to homer in his two initial Series plate appearances, a feat later matched by Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves in 1996. Only two Oakland players collected hits, a pair each from Tenace and Bert Campaneris. The A&#x27;s received a combined four innings of shutout relief from Rollie Fingers and Vida Blue to secure the victory for starter Ken Holtzman. Blue stranded the potential tying run at third base to end the game by inducing Pete Rose to ground out to second base.

===Game 2===

The Game 2 hero was A&#x27;s left fielder Joe Rudi, who smacked a home run and added a sparkling, game-saving catch up against the wall in the ninth inning on a ball hit by Denis Menke. Catfish Hunter pitched eight strong innings, consistently wiggling out of trouble, and also added an RBI single in the second off Ross Grimsley. The Reds&#x27; failure to produce in the clutch was as much the story as Rudi&#x27;s heroics as Cincinnati had leadoff baserunners in five innings but only scored a run in the ninth.

The A&#x27;s scored a run in the second when George Hendrick beat out a double-play grounder after Sal Bando led off with a single. Hendrick went to second on a Dick Green single and scored on a close play at the plate on a Hunter single. Bert Campaneris followed with a hit and Green attempted to score, but was successfully thrown out at the plate by Pete Rose. The A&#x27;s had four hits in the inning, but only scored one run. Rudi extended the lead to 2–0 with his home run in the 3rd.

In the ninth, Tony Pérez led off with a base hit before Rudi&#x27;s catch of Menke&#x27;s drive for the first out. Oakland first baseman Mike Hegan then made another great defensive play when César Gerónimo, the next Reds hitter, lined a shot that appeared headed down the line for extra bases. Hegan dove for the ball, knocked it down, and dove for the bag, barely beating Geronimo. Pérez took second and scored on a Hal McRae single through the middle. Rollie Fingers then relieved Hunter and induced pinch hitter Julián Javier to pop out to Hegan in foul territory to end the game. The World Series home loss was Reds&#x27; seventh-straight, which included three in the 1961 World Series against the New York Yankees (at Crosley Field) and two in the 1970 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles.

Jackie Robinson, the first black major league player of the modern era, made his final public appearance in Cincinnati before Game 2 (he died nine days later). In a brief speech, he expressed his desire to see a black manager in Major League Baseball, a color barrier that had not yet been broken. Two years later, Frank Robinson was hired in October 1974 to manage the Cleveland Indians to break It would take until 1992 before another black manager, Cito Gaston, would win the World Series with the Toronto Blue Jays (Gaston would repeat this for Toronto the following year.)

===Game 3===
Heavy storms delayed Game 3 by a day, but the Reds got back into the series behind a strong performance from starter Jack Billingham, who held the A&#x27;s to three hits in eight innings. The Reds pushed across the game&#x27;s only run in the seventh when César Gerónimo singled home Tony Pérez. Pérez scored despite slipping on the still damp grass as he rounded third. Oakland shortstop Bert Campaneris was apparently unaware that Pérez had slipped; otherwise, it appeared Campaneris may have had a play at the plate. Clay Carroll pitched the ninth for the save.

A rare trick play occurred in the eighth inning. The Reds had Joe Morgan on third and Bobby Tolan on first base with Rollie Fingers pitching to NL MVP Johnny Bench. Fingers pitched carefully to Bench before Tolan stole second base on ball three. After the stolen base, with the count 3–2 on Bench, A&#x27;s manager Dick Williams visited the mound. After a long discussion, he motioned for an intentional walk to Bench. A&#x27;s catcher Gene Tenace stood to catch ball four, but at the last second returned to his crouch as Fingers delivered a strike on the outside corner. Bench watched the pitch go by for strike three.

===Game 4===
A very pivotal game in the series, and it was Gene Tenace and Oakland non-starters who came through in the ninth inning to rally the Athletics to victory to put the A&#x27;s up 3 games to 1.

The game was a pitchers&#x27; duel between a pair of left-handed starters: Cincinnati&#x27;s Don Gullett and Oakland&#x27;s Ken Holtzman. Through seven innings, the game&#x27;s lone run was a result of a fifth-inning home run by Tenace, his third homer of the series. With two outs in the top of the eighth inning and Dave Concepción on second base, A&#x27;s manager Dick Williams replaced Holtzman with left-hander Vida Blue to face left-handed hitters Joe Morgan and Bobby Tolan. Blue walked Morgan and allowed a clutch two-run double to Tolan, giving Cincinnati the lead as the Reds seemed poised to tie the series at 2 games apiece.

In the bottom of the ninth, however, with one out, the A&#x27;s strung together four consecutive hits to score two runs. Pinch hitter Gonzalo Márquez singled, Tenace followed with a single, Don Mincher followed with another pinch-hit single scoring pinch-runner Allan Lewis to tie the game before a third pinch-hitter, Ángel Mangual, singled off Clay Carroll to score Tenace with the game-winner to put Oakland up three games to one. It was the first time that a team collected three pinch hits in the same World Series inning.

===Game 5===
Up three games to one and with ace Catfish Hunter on the mound, the A&#x27;s looked poised to close out Cincinnati. Compounding problems for the Reds, their ace pitcher Gary Nolan, who had been battling shoulder and neck issues during the second half of the regular season, was unable to pitch Game 5, forcing part-time starter Jim McGlothlin to start instead. But two of the struggling Reds, Pete Rose and Joe Morgan who were a combined 1 for 28 at the plate in the first four games, stepped up to make key plays. Rose led off the game with a home run, and he would also drive in the game-winning run in the ninth inning. The game ended dramatically when Morgan threw out the potential game-tying run at the plate as the Reds staved off elimination.

Trailing 1–0 in the second, Gene Tenace hit his fourth home run of the series, a three-run shot, to put Oakland up by two. McGlothlin was removed after pitching just three innings. The Reds cut the lead to 3–2 in the fourth on a home run by Denis Menke. Gonzalo Marquez put the A&#x27;s back in front by two runs with a pinch-hit RBI single in the fourth.

The Reds continued to answer. With two outs in the fifth, Joe Morgan walked. With a 3–2 count on Bobby Tolan, Morgan broke for second and was able to score when Tolan lined a base hit into right-center field. The speedy Morgan and Tolan collaborated once again in the eighth. Morgan again walked, stole second and scored on another Tolan single to tie the game at four.

In the ninth, Rose singled in the go-ahead run to give the Reds a 5–4 lead. Game 3 starter Jack Billingham came in to relieve in the ninth, but the A&#x27;s put runners on the corners with one out. Bert Campaneris hit a foul pop behind first base that Tony Pérez drifted back and appeared to call for. But second baseman Morgan raced over, waved Perez off, caught the ball, slipped on the grass but got up and fired a throw to nail pinch runner Blue Moon Odom, who had tagged from third.

The Friday afternoon contest was the last non-weekend World Series day game. The three games in Oakland had all been scheduled to be played at night, but Game 3 was rained out, forcing Game 5 to be played on a Friday, originally scheduled as a travel day. The game was played in the afternoon (1 p.m. PT) to allow ample time for the teams to travel to Cincinnati for Game 6 the next day.

===Game 6===

Back at the friendly confines of Riverfront Stadium, the Reds tied the series at three games apiece with a rout. Johnny Bench, who had no RBI in the series to that point, broke a scoreless tie in the fourth with a homer off starter Vida Blue. The A&#x27;s fought back on a Dick Green RBI double in their half of the fifth, but from then on it was all Reds. Dave Concepción had a sacrifice fly in the fifth, and Tony Pérez an RBI single in the sixth (his first RBI of the Series). The Reds then broke it open with a five-run seventh an RBI single by Joe Morgan and a pair of two-run singles by Bobby Tolan and César Gerónimo.

===Game 7===
Gene Tenace capped a spectacular World Series with two hits, two RBI and he also scored the game-winning run in the sixth inning on Sal Bando&#x27;s double.

Oakland scored an unearned run in the first inning off Jack Billingham when Reds center fielder Bobby Tolan misplayed a fly ball by Mangual into a three-base error. Mangual scored on a two-out single by Tenace on a ball that hit a seam in the Astroturf and bounced over the head of third baseman Denis Menke. The Reds tied the game in the fifth on a bases loaded sacrifice fly to the center field wall by Hal McRae. However, McRae was pinch hitting for Billingham who had allowed no earned runs in innings in the series against the A&#x27;s. His replacement in the sixth inning, Pedro Borbón, surrendered RBI doubles to Tenace and Bando. Bando&#x27;s drive appeared catchable, but Tolan pulled up short of the wall due to a strained hamstring and the ball went over Tolan to the base of the wall. He was later removed from the game on a double switch. The Reds closed to within 3–2 in the eighth on a sacrifice fly by Perez, but A&#x27;s closer Rollie Fingers shut down the Reds in the ninth.

==Composite box==
1972 World Series (4–3): Oakland Athletics (A.L.) over Cincinnati Reds (N.L.)

&lt;br&gt;
This was the second of three consecutive years in which the World Series went seven games and the champion was outscored. Six of the games were decided by one run, the sole exception was Game 6, an 8–1 Reds&#x27; win.

==Broadcasting==
NBC aired the series on both television and radio. Curt Gowdy (on TV) and Jim Simpson (on radio) alternated play-by-play with team announcers Al Michaels (Reds) and Monte Moore (Athletics).

Tony Kubek, who had served as an in-the-stands reporter for NBC&#x27;s four previous World Series telecasts, was promoted to the booth as a color analyst, becoming the first former player to serve in that capacity since Joe Garagiola in .

==Aftermath==
Hall of Famer and trailblazer Jackie Robinson died of a heart attack two days after the series ended. Robinson had thrown out the first pitch in Game 2 in the World Series. In addressing the crowd, he said he hoped to see a Black MLB manager soon. Frank Robinson, no relation, achieved that in 1974.

The World Series victory for the Oakland A&#x27;s was the first for the franchise since the days of Connie Mack when the team was in Philadelphia and had won in 1930. The victory ensured manager Dick Williams&#x27; return for another year. It was the Athletics&#x27; sixth World Series title, and the first of three consecutive titles. This was the last time to date that an American League team had won a World Series Game 7 on the road until , when the Houston Astros did so in Los Angeles.

The Reds would go on to form a dynasty for themselves, becoming the third NL team (following the Chicago Cubs in 1907–08 and the New York Giants in 1921–22) to win consecutive World Series in 1975 and 1976. 

These two teams met again in the World Series 18 years later in 1990. Their managers would meet again in the Fall Classic 12 years later in 1984, helming different teams and swapping leagues.

<text>Frederick Hitch, VC (29 November 1856 – 6 January 1913) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Born in Southgate, in Middlesex, he joined the British Army and served as a private in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers). During the Anglo-Zulu War, aged 22, he fought at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift (22–23 January 1879), and was awarded the VC for his actions. The citation was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;:

The soldiers were assisted in passing out ammunition by Padre George Smith. Hitch was severely wounded during the action, and was still in the Royal Victoria Military Hospital, Netley, Southampton when he received his medal from Queen Victoria. He was one of the eleven recipients of the VC awarded for their part in the battle.

==Later life==

Hitch&#x27;s wounds were so severe that they led to his discharge from service on 25 August 1879, having served 2 years and 6 months. He then moved from job to job, unable to perform manual work due to the damage to his arm he had received during the battle. He married in 1883, but reportedly found life difficult living on his disability pension from the government, which amounted to just £10 a year. In 1901, whilst climbing a ladder he suffered a fall. When he awoke in hospital his VC, which he always wore, had been stolen. Another version is that he was given a position in Whitehall as a ceremonial guard and his VC was cut off his chest and he was knocked to the ground. In this version his VC was replaced by the regiment. His missing VC later reappeared at auction and was bought by Hitch&#x27;s descendants for £85. Both the original and the replacement are in the regimental museum.

Forced to pay for a new one from his own pocket, Hitch also lost his job soon afterwards when he was accused of faking the fall to hide the fact that he had sold his medal to raise funds. This has never been proven. Hitch had eight children, and managed to land a steady job as driver of a smart horse-drawn cab (pulled by his own pair of horses), which he later exchanged for a motor taxi cab. This provided him with a comfortable income for some years.

==Death==
By the time of his death in 1913, Hitch was living alone in Chiswick, West London at 62 Cranbrook Road where he is commemorated with a blue plaque from English Heritage. He collapsed and died at his home whilst talking to a neighbour. He was buried in St Nicholas&#x27; churchyard in Chiswick, with full military honours. His funeral was attended by a large number of London &#x27;cabbies&#x27; and he is commemorated by the Fred Hitch Gallantry Award for cab drivers.

==Memorial==

He is buried in the centre of the churchyard of St Nicholas Church, Chiswick. The grave is difficult to miss since it is more of a monument than a grave, featuring a helmet on top. The memorial was paid for by subscriptions to a well-supported fund established shortly after Hitch&#x27;s death by Chiswick&#x27;s Urban District Council. Notable subscribers including leading Chiswick figures, Mayors of the London Boroughs of Hammersmith, of Kensington, and of Poplar, four MPs and the wealthy banker Leopold de Rothschild. Additional funds came from a donation by the American producer, Joseph Menchen, of the proceeds of a screening of the world&#x27;s first all-colour feature film. Menschen opened London&#x27;s newly built Picture House cinema, at 166 Oxford Street, with &quot;The Miracle&quot; and gave the takings of its first matinee to Hitch&#x27;s memorial fund.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh, Brecon, Powys, Wales.

==Legacy==

Hitch was portrayed by David Kernan in the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;.

<text>Charles Thomas Kennedy, (6 January 1873 – 24 April 1907) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Kennedy was 27 years, and a private in the 1st Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place at Dewetsdorp, South Africa for which he was awarded the VC.
Kennedy received the Victoria Cross from King Edward VII at an impressive investiture held at St James&#x27;s Palace on 17 December 1901. He had, by now, returned to England and been posted to the 2nd Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry. He subsequently failed to meet the Army&#x27;s physical requirements owing to his wound and was discharged from the Service on 25 June 1902. He then returned to Edinburgh, but was fatally injured in 1907, when a horse bolted in Leith Walk, and its cart threatened the lives of passers-by. He died between Brunswick Road and the Infirmary.

==Further information==
He is buried in North Merchiston Cemetery, Edinburgh, the city in which he was born. He has since had a street in Fountainbridge where he was brought up named in his honour and a bench placed in the Grassmarket area, again, near where he lived as a boy.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of The Royal Highland Fusiliers, Glasgow, Scotland.

<text>Bhajji state was a protected tributary state in the hills of Simla, now Himachal Pradesh, under the government of Punjab. Its area was 248 km² and the population (1881) of 12,106 and 1901 of 13,309 consisted almost entirely of Sikhs distributed in 327 villages. The annual tribute was 144 pounds. The capital was Seoni, on the banks of the Sutlej. 

The Pal dynasty of Rajput origin ruled it with the title of Rana. The founder of the dynasty was a brother of the Raja of Kutlehar and came from Kangra; he acquired the territory by conquest. The country was conquered by the Gurkhas between 1803 and 1815 but they were expelled by the British who confirmed the old dynasty by a sanad dated 4 September, 1815. Under the British protectorate, death sentences imposed by the Rana required British confirmation. In 1842 the Rana Rudra Pal abdicated in favor of his son and retired to Haridwar. A century later Bir Pal did the same.

<text>Robert Brett Lunger (born November 14, 1945) is an American racecar driver.

Lunger was educated at the Holderness School, and Princeton University. He dropped out of Princeton after three years to enlist for service in Vietnam. He was a political science major. At the time he was preparing a thesis on U.S. policy on Southeast Asia. The Gulf of Tonkin Incident refuted much of what Lunger contended in his writing. A former US Marine lieutenant who served in the Vietnam war, his racing career was mostly spent in privateer cars, paid for by his family wealth, as Lunger&#x27;s mother, Jane du Pont Lunger, was an heiress to the Du Pont family fortune and a prominent racehorse breeder.

Lunger participated in 43 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting in 1975, without scoring any championship points during his four seasons in Formula One.

Lunger&#x27;s Formula One career started alongside James Hunt in the Hesketh team, followed by a season with Surtees in 1976. For 1977, he started the season with a year-old March 761 run by Bob Sparshott and entered under the name of his sponsor, Chesterfield Racing, but switched to a McLaren M23 after three races. In 1978, he stayed with the McLaren M23 and also tried an M26, but now entered by Sparshott&#x27;s racing outfit, BS Fabrications. After a one-off drive for Ensign at the end of the season, Lunger moved on to sports car racing.

He is also known for helping to rescue Niki Lauda from his burning Ferrari in 1976 at the Nürburgring.

== Early career ==

Lunger was not raised a car enthusiast. He was brought up to enjoy baseball, hockey, and football. He became interested in auto racing when a friend took him to a race in 1965. By 1966 he was the &quot;rich kid&quot; of the Can-Am series.

==Sports cars and Formula 5000==

Lunger finished 8th in a McLaren Chevrolet in the 1966, Nassau Trophy race, in Nassau, Bahamas. He was only a few seconds behind Peter Gregg in a Porsche Carrera 6. Lunger fielded a Lola T160 chassis in the 1968 Canadian American Challenge Cup (Can-Am). Others who drove Lola T160 cars were Swede Savage and Chuck Parsons.

Following the stint in the US Marines and the rank of captain in 1970, and competing in two SCCA National events, Lunger was among drivers in the 1971 L&amp;M Grand Prix, at Lime Rock Park, who were competing for 2nd place in the 1971 SCCA L&amp;M 5000 Continental Championship. Lunger started the race with a 103 degree fever having been diagnosed with mononucleosis the previous day. As race progressed he started to lose strength allowing Sam Posey to pass and moving Lunger to third in the championship. He was hospitalized after the race for several days. His first major win was that year at Brainerd International Raceway in the Minnesota Grand Prix. Lunger had 58 points prior to the event. Lunger came in 3rd overall in the overall standing, after David Hobbs had clinched the title with 99 points. His home at the time was Pomona, California.

Between 1972 and 1973 he raced in European Formula Two.His best finish was a 4th place at Mantorp Park in Sweden, for Space Racing, in their March-Ford BDA 722.

In 1972 Lunger was 3rd again in the L&amp;M Continental 5000 Championship, trailing Graham McRae and Sam Posey. He moved into 3rd place following a win at Road Atlanta in August, in the Road Atlanta Grand Prix. He followed this up with another win, this time in the Lime Rock Grand Prix.

Lunger might have finished third again in 1973 had mechanical problems not held him to just four finishes, and seventh overall. In addition to this, he completed in the European Formula Two Championship and Torneio Internacional de Formula 2 do Brasil.

In March 1973, Lunger placed 2nd to Peter Gethin in the opening race of Rothman&#x27;s Formula 5000 European Championship at Brands Hatch. He was in a Hogan Racing Lola. In the April 1973 Formula 5000 race at Riverside International Raceway, Lunger finished 6th. He led the first 19 laps before a stuck throttle forced him to spin at turn 7. A 17-second pit stop to look for damage dropped him to 7th place. Lunger was 3rd in a Lola Chevrolet at the L&amp;M Watkins Glen Grand Prix, in June 1973. Jody Scheckter and Brian Redman came in ahead of him in the Formula 5000 race. Lunger was 2nd in a Lola in a Formula 5000 race at Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, in September 1973. In between races in the US F5000, Lunger continued to race in the English-based Rothmans Championship, winning twice, at Snetterton and Mallory Park for Sid Taylor Racing in their Trojan T101.

Lunger drove for the Dan Gurney&#x27;s Anglo American Racers team, in their Jorgensen Eagle 73A which debuted in Formula 5000 in 1974. He started all seven races of the 1974 SCCA/USAC F5000 Championship, posting a second, third and a sixth place, ending the season fifth in the overall standings. The Eagle marque was introduced in Formula 5000 in preparation for an entrance into Formula One in 1975. Redman won the Mid-Ohio Formula 5000 race in Lexington, Ohio, in June 1974. Lunger placed 2nd, 1 minute and 14 seconds behind. Lunger was 3rd in the Mosport International Raceway Formula 5000 race on June 16.

In July 1974, Lunger piloted a BMW 3.0 CSL in the six hours of Watkins Glen and competed in a Trans Am race, sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America, with George Follmer. Lunger started 8th and ran as high as 4th in the Can-Am Challenge Trophy race. He developed engine problems with 4 laps to go. Lunger said, &quot;We&#x27;re not ready yet, but we&#x27;re getting there.&quot; Lunger won 2 heat races but crashed during the 1974 California Grand Prix at Ontario Motor Speedway. He was trying to pass a slower car and at the same time hold off eventual race winner, Mario Andretti. Lunger&#x27;s Eagle Chevy collided with Mickey Rupp as they entered a turn at the end of the infield straight. Their cars spun in a cloud of dust off the race track. Lunger assisted rescue workers in pulling Rupp from his car. Lunger and Follmer secured 2nd place in a turbocharged Porsche 935of Vasek Polak, in the 1977 six hours endurance race at Watkins Glen. They were more than 3.377 mile-lap behind the winning team of Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass. The victors drove a factory Porsche 935 with a advantage over the 20 other &quot;customer&quot; Porsches, which composed the field of 44 cars.

Lunger teamed with Follmer and Derek Bell in a Vasek Polak entry in the Los Angeles Times 6-Hour Grand Prix of Endurance in April 1979. The 3-man team placed 3rd, 6 laps behind in a Porsche 935/79. The car started in the 23rd row due to engine problems during qualifying that kept it from posting a time.

==Formula One==

===1975 Hesketh===

Lunger joined the Hesketh Racing Formula One team in 1975 for the running of the 1975 Austrian Grand Prix. Aside from Mario Andretti and Mark Donohue, he was the only American driver on the elite circuit. At the age of 29 Lunger found himself without a car to drive for a major team. His friends bought him a ride with the team of Alexander Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh for the remainder of the 1975 Formula One season. Lunger&#x27;s brother, Dave, and Rod Campbell, a veteran motor racing public relations man, formed a combine in late 1975 to promote a Formula One ride for Lunger. In his debut Lunger started from the 9th row. He finished 13th in his Hesketh-Ford. In qualifying for the 1975 United States Grand Prix, Lunger wrecked his Hesketh, sustaining superficial damage to his car. He recovered to become one of 24 qualifiers for the race. Lunger ran as high as 8th at Watkins Glen, before he retired. In the 1975 Italian Grand Prix he came in 10th.

===1976 Surtees===
In 1976 Lunger moved to the Team Surtees. The corporation obtained sponsorship from Chesterfield, Rand Time Corporation, the Delaware Trust Company, and Champion Spark Plugs Company. On the 1st day of qualifying for the 1976 United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California, Lunger averaged only . Driving a Surtees-Ford, he was in 21st position. He described the dilemma of negotiating the Long Beach race track, which incorporated 85 circuits from Ocean Boulevard downtown to a parking lot and to Shoreline Drive, not far from the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and then back to Ocean Boulevard. &quot;This course is so narrow, it&#x27;s like trying to drive a Sherman tank through a parking lot.&quot; Lunger failed to make the field on the 2nd day of qualifying. Only 20 cars started due to the narrowness of the Long Beach circuit. Lunger&#x27;s Surtees broke the clutch in practice and was never correctly fixed.

 The 1976 British GP was probably the best race of his GP career, qualifying mid grid, he climbed through the field to challenge his teammate Alan Jones. 

Lunger is perhaps most renowned for being one of the drivers, along with Guy Edwards, Arturo Merzario and Harald Ertl, who saved Niki Lauda from his burning car during the 1976 German Grand Prix. Lunger described Lauda&#x27;s accident which occurred on the 2nd lap. He went off at a speed of between and . He had apparently crashed on exit, went through a couple of rows of catch fence, up a relatively steep bank, and back into the middle of the track, the Ferrari on fire. Lunger said that Edwards was able to get by Lauda&#x27;s car to the left but Lunger was unable to avoid the wrecked Ferrari. He made contact about three quarters on because &quot;I was committed to a line and couldn&#x27;t make it through the debris.&quot; Ertl followed, colliding with the Surtees and knocking it into Lauda&#x27;s Ferrari. Lunger&#x27;s fire extinguishers were set off by the collision which was fortunate and saved time in the rescue. Lunger got out of his Surtees which was tangled up with the Ferrari. The extinguishers going off had dampened the fire somewhat. Workers arrived and kept the fire down, eventually putting foam on the Ferrari. This enabled Lunger and Merzario to get close to the fire, although they could not free Lauda at first. Lauda was conscious, struggling to get free on his own. Again the fire flared up and kept the men back from the car&#x27;s side. Lunger jumped on top of the Ferrari and grabbed Lauda by his shoulders. Merzario unbuckled the seatbelts and Lunger and Lauda tumbled out of the car as a portion of the cockpit broke apart. As Lauda and Lunger emerged corner workers put foam on them. They lay for a few seconds in the grass. The burning fuel was moving toward them so Lunger and Lauda walked 6 to 8 steps away from the fire.

===1977 - 1978 McLaren, Ensign===

In January 1977 Lunger announced that he had signed with BS Fabrications, an English race team, and manufacturer of race car components. He fielded a McLaren M23, the same car driven by James Hunt when he won the 1976 Formula One World Championship. In his first race of the season, Lunger finished 14th in the 1977 South African Grand Prix driving a March-Ford. The week prior to the race he lost a right rear wheel and crashed. It took his crew a week to rebuild the car from the ground up. During qualifying he drove three timed laps before his car blew an engine. This meant that Lunger started the race at the rear. Lunger qualified his March on the 11th row, 21st starting position for the 1977 United States Grand Prix West. He did not complete the race after he was in an accident on the 4th lap. He drove a McLaren to a 19th-place finish in the 1977 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim. Lunger qualified 17th in Zeltweg for the 1977 Austrian Grand Prix. He had a time of 1 minute, 41.40 seconds. He placed 9th at Zandvoort in the 1977 Dutch Grand Prix. His McLaren was 2 laps behind winner Lauda. Lunger was 10th, 2 laps down, at the 1977 United States Grand Prix.

He was one lap off the pace and finished 19th at Buenos Aires in the 1978 Argentine Grand Prix. Lunger&#x27;s McLaren was 20th at Rio de Janeiro in the 1978 Brazilian Grand Prix and was 11th at Johannesburg in the 1978 South African Grand Prix, in March. Lunger started 24th, in last position, for the 1978 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. His qualifying time was 1:20.39. He went on to score his career best F1 finish, 8th place, albeit, one lap behind winner Carlos Reutemann. In the 1978 Austrian Grand Prix he finished 8th, 2 laps off the winning pace. Lunger started an Ensign from 24th position in the 1978 United States Grand Prix. His time was 1:43.067. He finished 13th.

Lunger finished 4th in the non-championship 1978 BRDC International Trophy race at Silverstone. He was behind winner Keke Rosberg, 2nd place Emerson Fittipaldi, and Tony Trimmer. The $190,000 event was hampered by rain over its .

In many ways, Lunger was one of the last privateers in Formula One, plying his trade in year-old machinery, prepared by small independent racing teams. He called time on F1, at the end of the 1978 season, and returned to US Sports Car racing.

==Post-race life==
Lunger failed to find an acceptable ride in 1979. During his retirement from racing he worked as a journalist with CBS, covering Formula One races like the 1979 South African Grand Prix. He completed his degree at Princeton.

Lunger also became an author of a workbook series centered around responsibility, and as a result, founded Responsibility Today. The I Am Responsible Movement was Lunger&#x27;s way of giving back to the community by drawing from his many successes and failures during his early life and racing career. Lunger continues to expand his organization by attending conferences and writing blog articles related to responsible decision making on Responsibility Today&#x27;s website.

Lunger takes part in cycling competitions in his spare time, when not running a research and development business. He is also a pilot, and this work, along with his wife, includes the Angel Flight Network.

<text>The 1971 World Series was the championship round of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1971 season and featured the first night game in its history. The 68th edition of the Fall Classic was a best-of-seven playoff between the defending World Series and American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles and the National League (NL) champion Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates won the World Series in seven games, in large part because of superstar right fielder Roberto Clemente, whose all-around brilliance was on full display on a national stage. Game 4 in Pittsburgh was the first World Series game played 

Many in the know expected the highly touted Orioles to repeat as world champions, but the upstart Pirates proved to be the better team after some early struggles. The home side prevailed in each of the first six contests. In Game 7 in Baltimore, Pirates ace Steve Blass pitched a four-hit complete game in a win over Mike Cuellar and 

In his final World Series appearance, the 37-year-old Clemente became the first Spanish-speaking player to earn World Series Most Valuable Player Award. The veteran delivered 12 hits for a .414 batting average and reached base four other times, two on walks and two on errors. He hit safely in all seven games of the Series, duplicating a feat that he had performed in .

Twenty-one-year-old rookie Bruce Kison pitched scoreless innings and allowed just one hit in two appearances for the Pirates. The right-handed side-winder set a record of three hit batters in a World Series game, which also tied the 1907 record.

This was the first of three consecutive World Series, all seven games, in which the winning team scored fewer runs overall. The trend continued for the next seven-game series in 1975. These two teams met again in the Fall Classic eight years later with the same result, as the Pirates won the final three games to win in seven, the final one on the road.

==Background==

The Pirates won the National League East by a rather comfortable seven-game margin over the St. Louis Cardinals then defeated the San Francisco Giants, three games to one, in the National League Championship Series. Meanwhile, the Orioles dominated the American League East by 12 games over the Detroit Tigers then swept the Oakland A&#x27;s in the American League Championship Series.

The Orioles were coming off their third straight AL playoff series sweep (twice over the Minnesota Twins and once over Oakland) and their third straight season with over 100 wins: 109 (1969), 108 (1970), 101 (1971). Featuring four pitchers with 20 or more wins (Dave McNally (21), Mike Cuellar (20), Pat Dobson (20), Jim Palmer (20)), the bats of sluggers Frank Robinson (.281 batting average, 28 home runs, 99 RBI) and Boog Powell (.256, 22, 92) and sure hands of Brooks Robinson at third base and Mark Belanger at shortstop, the O&#x27;s were primed to defend their title.

The Pirates were in the World Series for the first time since the heroics of Bill Mazeroski (his only appearance in the series came as a pinch-hitter in Game 1) in Game 7 of the 1960 match-up against the New York Yankees. Though not as decorated as their opponents, the Bucs boasted a deep staff in their own right. The group featured 19-game winner Dock Ellis, 15-game winner Steve Blass and closer Dave Giusti (30 saves).

What the Pirates did best was hit the baseball with authority, though, as no team scored more runs in either league. The best offense in the big leagues featured mashers Willie Stargell (.295, 48, 125), Bob Robertson (.271, 26, 72) and Richie Hebner (.271, 17, 67) and slashers Clemente (.341, 13, 86), Al Oliver (.282, 14, 64) and Manny Sanguillen (.319, 7, 81) among others.

==Summary==

: postponed from October 10 due to rain

==Matchups==

===Game 1===

The Pirates scored three in the second off of Dave McNally due to sloppy defense by the Orioles. Bob Robertson led off with a walk and went to second on a wild pitch by O&#x27;s starter Dave McNally. Manny Sanguillén grounded to short, but Mark Belanger threw wildly to third in an attempt to retire Robertson. Robertson scored and Sanguillén pulled in at second. After advancing to third on a ground ball by José Pagán, Sanguillén scored on a suicide squeeze bunt laid down by Jackie Hernández, who went to second when catcher Elrod Hendricks threw wildly to first. Dave Cash singled home Hernandez with the only hit the Pirates got the whole inning among the three runs.

The Orioles rallied behind the long-ball. Frank Robinson hit a home run in the second and Merv Rettenmund blasted a three-run home run in the third off Dock Ellis to give the Orioles the lead. Don Buford added a home run off of Bob Moose in the fifth as McNally settled down and allowed only two more hits and no runs the rest of the way.

===Game 2===


Following a one-day delay caused by the first World Series rainout in nine years, the Orioles took a series lead on Monday afternoon. Baltimore pounded six Pirate pitchers for 14 hits (all singles) and 11 runs, led by three hits and four RBI by Brooks Robinson, who drove in the first Oriole run in the second. In the fourth, with the bases loaded by a single, hit-by-pitch and walk, Davey Johnson&#x27;s two-run single made it 3–0 Orioles and knocked starter Bob Johnson out of the game. Two walks by Bruce Kison forced in another run to make it 4–0 Orioles. In the fifth, after two singles, Elrod Hendricks&#x27;s two-run single, aided by an error and Robinson&#x27;s single, made it 7–0 Orioles. After another single, Bob Veale relieved Moose and allowed two walks to load the bases and force in another run. Don Buford&#x27;s groundout and Merv Rettenmund&#x27;s RBI single made it 10–0 Orioles. Robinson&#x27;s RBI single next inning off of Bob Miller capped the Orioles&#x27; scoring. Jim Palmer pitched seven shutout innings and helped himself the easy way by drawing two bases-loaded walks for two RBIs - the only time this has happened in a World Series game. The Pirates got their runs in the eighth when Richie Hebner hit a three-run homer 

This was very nearly the first night game in World Series history. After rain postponed Game 2—originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon—Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suggested that the rescheduled game be played on Monday night. However, the Pirates objected as they wanted the honor of hosting the first World Series night game themselves at Three Rivers Stadium when Game Four was played. Thus Game Two was played on Monday afternoon in Baltimore.

===Game 3===

With the Series shifting to Three Rivers Stadium and with Steve Blass available, the Pirates got back into it. Roberto Clemente&#x27;s groundout with runners on second and third in the first put them up 1–0. Manny Sanguillén hit a leadoff double in the sixth and scored on Jose Pagan&#x27;s single to make it 2–0 Pirates. Steve Blass pitched a complete game, allowing only three hits and one run (on a Frank Robinson home run in the seventh) and striking out eight.

The big blow on offense was struck by Bob Robertson, who slammed a three-run home run in the seventh inning off starter Mike Cuellar after missing the bunt sign. Manager Danny Murtaugh issued the sign to Robertson, who had no sacrifice bunts the entire season. Television replays showed Roberto Clemente, who was on second base, appearing to call a timeout, but Cuellar was already in his windup at the time. Blass was sitting next to Murtaugh in the dugout at the time, and told the Pirate manager: &quot;If you fine him (Robertson, for missing the bunt sign), I&#x27;ll pay.&quot; Murtaugh didn&#x27;t. 

===Game 4===
In the first night game in World Series history, it started out looking like a long night for the Pirates. Starting pitcher Luke Walker gave up singles to the Orioles&#x27; first three batters, Paul Blair, Mark Belanger, and Merv Rettenmund, loading the bases. Blair scored and the others advanced on a Manny Sanguillén passed ball. Walker then intentionally walked Frank Robinson and gave up consecutive sacrifice flies to Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell, giving the Orioles a 

Manager Danny Murtaugh then pulled Walker in favor of Bruce Kison. Kison proceeded to get the final out of the inning and then pitched shutout baseball for the next six innings, allowing only one hit and despite hitting three Oriole batters, a World Series record.

Kison&#x27;s heroics allowed the Pirates to claw back off of starter Pat Dobson. Willie Stargell and Al Oliver cut the lead to in the bottom of the first with back-to-back RBI doubles after a leadoff walk. Oliver tied the score at 3 in the third with an RBI single.

In the seventh, Bob Robertson and Sanguillén stroked one-out singles off reliever Eddie Watt. Pinch-hitter Vic Davalillo then lofted a short fly to center that Paul Blair dropped. Robertson reached third and Davalillo first, but Sanguillén was caught in a rundown between second and third. Backup catcher Milt May then batted for Kison and delivered a clutch go-ahead RBI single, scoring Robertson.

Dave Giusti pitched the final two innings of hitless ball for the Pirates and got the save.

===Game 5===

Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh chose Nelson Briles to start Game 5 over the Pirates&#x27; top starters, Steve Blass and Dock Ellis, choosing to save them for potential Games 6 and 7. The gamble paid off as Briles pitched an efficient two-hit shutout. Bob Robertson&#x27;s leadoff home run in the second inning off Dave McNally put the Pirates up 1–0. Manny Sanguillén singled, stole second and scored on Nelson Briles&#x27;s two-out single to bump the Pirates&#x27; lead to 2–0. A wild pitch with runners on first and third allowed another run to score to make it 3–0 after three innings. Gene Clines hit a leadoff triple in the fifth and scored on Roberto Clemente&#x27;s single, his first RBI scoring hit of the series, to cap the scoring as the Pirates took a series lead heading back to Baltimore.

===Game 6===

The 400th game played in World Series history, Baltimore returned to Memorial Stadium facing elimination. With Steve Blass needing another day of rest and Dock Ellis nursing an injury, Danny Murtaugh had to go to the well once again, starting reliever Bob Moose—his sixth different starter in this Series. Moose responded well by pitching shutout ball for five innings, while his Pirate teammates got him a 2–0 lead. Al Oliver doubled in the second off Jim Palmer and scored on a Bob Robertson single. Roberto Clemente added a homer in the third.

Moose started having trouble in the sixth, however. Don Buford belted a one-out homer and Moose allowed the next two batters to reach base before giving way to Bob Johnson, who ended the threat. The Orioles tied it off Johnson in the seventh when Mark Belanger singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Davey Johnson.

Both teams threatened late; the Orioles had runners on second and third in the bottom of the ninth with two out, but failed to score. The Pirates loaded the bases in the top of the tenth, but Dave McNally, pitching in relief, squelched the threat.

The Orioles staved off a World Series defeat in their half of the tenth when Frank Robinson drew a one-out walk and went to third on a Merv Rettenmund single. Brooks Robinson lifted a short fly to center and Frank Robinson tagged and scored the winning run, barely beating Vic Davalillo&#x27;s throw to the plate.

===Game 7===

With ace pitchers Steve Blass and Mike Cuellar on the mound for their respective teams, Game 7 proved to be a pitcher&#x27;s duel.

Series MVP Roberto Clemente drew first blood for the Pirates by hitting a two-out homer in the fourth off Cuellar. The Pirates added another run in the eighth when José Pagán doubled in Willie Stargell.

The only run the O&#x27;s could muster off Blass was an RBI groundout by Don Buford in the eighth. Blass would get his second complete game win of the series.

Game 7 was the only game in which the visiting team won. It was the fourth World Series in which the home team won each of the first six games before the road team won Game 7 with the others being 1955, 1956 and 1965.

After Game 2, the O&#x27;s bats went silent. After pounding the Pirates pitching staff for 16 runs and 24 hits in the first two games, the O&#x27;s scored only eight runs on 21 hits, hitting only .141 (21–149) in the next five games, enabling the Pirates to upset the Orioles. The O&#x27;s as a team hit a poor .205 for the series.

The first pitch was one hour later than usual due to a Baltimore ordinance, since repealed, which prohibited Sunday sporting events from beginning prior to 2 p.m. This also occurred in Game 4 of the 1966 World Series and Game 2 of the 1969 World Series.

<text>The Pyramid () is a 1992 novel written by Ismail Kadare. It is considered to serve both literary and dissident purposes. It is a political allegory of absolute political power.

==Background==
The first part of the novel was written in 1988-1990 but was rejected by the state publisher. It was serialized in January 1991 in several issues of the new opposition newspaper &quot;Democratic Renaissance&quot;.
 After the establishment of pluralism and democracy in Albania, it was completed and published in Tirana and Paris.

==Plot==
&quot;The Pyramid&quot; is a political allegory set in ancient Egypt. It is the tale of the conception and construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza by Cheops, but also of absolute political power.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; picked up on the significance of &quot;The Pyramid&quot;:

&quot;For the pyramid, viewed by his subjects as an abiding symbol of his total and incontestable power, comes to be seen by him as a personal memento mori, a constant and paralyzing reminder that his brief life will give way to an eternal entombment in stone.&quot;
In 1993, the novel was awarded the Prix Méditerranée Étranger in France.

<text>Heritage College is a public English-language college located on Cité des Jeunes Boulevard in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. It is the only English-language college in western Quebec.

==History==
What began as an offshoot of the much larger Collège de l&#x27;Outaouais, with an initial enrollment of 7 students, evolved into an official campus and eventually a college. With an ever-increasing population and a few stays in renovated buildings (including a bowling alley and a couple of French high schools), it finally achieved fully autonomous status in 1988 as Heritage College. In 1994, it opened the doors on its newly constructed, more permanent facility; just down the street from its larger sister francophone college. In 1977, when students were housed in the newly renovated École Ste-Marie, a heritage building on Maisonneuve Boulevard, this branch of the French college was officially recognized as Heritage Campus. On October 16, 1994, the new Heritage College, with a student population of 900, opened.

== Programs ==
The college offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly corresponds to an additional year of high school and what is considered the first year of university elsewhere in Canada, in preparation for a chosen field in university. Students who complete pre-university programs typically complete undergraduate degrees in three years. The technical programs, which take three-years to complete, applies to students who wish to pursue a skill trade. In addition Continuing education and services to business are provided. Heritage offers the following programs leading to a DEC:

Career programs: 
*Accounting and Management Technology
*Computer Science
*Early Childhood Care and Education
*Electronics Technology
*New Media and Publication Design
*Nursing
*Hospitality and Hotel Management
*Tourism

Pre-university programs: 
*Commerce1
*Liberal Arts
*Science
*Social Science
*Visual Arts

1Although Commerce is listed as a separate program, it is technically a profile of Social Science and thus, Graduates of Commerce receive a DEC in Social Science, not Commerce.

Heritage also offers several continuing education courses, some of which lead to an AEC.
Continuing Education offers various intensive day programs for adults such as Microsoft Network specialist and Bilingual Office System Administration.

Night courses also are offered.

==Student life==

The campus offers health and fitness facilities such as a fully furnished gym, a multi-purpose room suitable for dancing, yoga, etc. and a gymnasium used for various sports. 

The Heritage College Drama Club is the Bacchus Players.

S.Q.U.A.D. - Students Questing for Unity, Awareness and Diversity. Through activism, S.Q.U.A.D. is a club that wants to raise awareness for social, animal, environmental, human and political rights.

==Admission==
Applications are handled through Le Service régional d&#x27;admission du Montréal métropolitain, although Heritage has no campus or facilities in Montreal itself.

<doc id="1219646" wikidata="Q4295895" url="?curid=1219646" title="1970 World Series">
<text>The 1970 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1970 season. The 67th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League champion Baltimore Orioles (108–54 in the regular season) and the National League champion Cincinnati Reds (102–60). The Orioles won, four games to one.

In this series Emmett Ashford became the first African American to umpire a World Series. It also featured the first World Series games to be played on artificial turf, as Games 1 and 2 took place at Cincinnati&#x27;s first-year Riverfront Stadium.

This was the last World Series in which all games were played in the afternoon. It was also the third time in a World Series in which a team leading three games to none failed to complete the sweep by losing Game 4 but still won Game 5 to clinch the series; 1910 and 1937 were the others. It would later happen again in 2024 when the Los Angeles Dodgers failed to sweep the New York Yankees in Game 4, but won the series in Game 5. This was the last World Series until 2017 in which both participating teams won over 100 games during the regular season. This was also the first World Series to feature names on the back on both team uniforms.

==Background==

The Baltimore Orioles won the American League East division by 15 games over the New York Yankees and the Cincinnati Reds won the National League West division by games over the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Coming into the World Series, the Orioles had won 14 straight including the final 11 during the regular season then defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to none, in the American League Championship Series for the second straight year. The Reds went 32–30 in their last 62 regular season games, but swept the Pittsburgh Pirates, three games to none, in the National League Championship Series.

This World Series set up a classic matchup of a pair of teams laden with all-star players.

The 1970 Cincinnati Reds squad was the first edition of the &quot;Big Red Machine.&quot; Sparky Anderson&#x27;s first year as a major league manager produced 102 wins and the first of four NL pennants in a seven-year stretch. The Reds featured a heavy-hitting lineup that included future Hall of Famers in catcher Johnny Bench (45 home runs, 148 RBI and .293 batting average) and third baseman Tony Pérez (40, 129, .317), as well as all-time hits leader Pete Rose (15, 52, .316) in right field, NL stolen base leader Bobby Tolan (16, 80, .316) in center field and power-hitting first baseman Lee May (34, 94, .253). The Reds led the National League in batting average and finished third in runs scored. Cincinnati pitching, however, would be a weak spot throughout the Series. Two-time 20-game winner Jim Maloney could only make three starts during the regular season and was shelved with a ruptured tendon in his toe. Two 1970 All Star game representatives, Jim Merritt (20–12) and rookie Wayne Simpson (14–3), were suffering arm injuries. Merritt, who won 20 games by the end of August, pitched less than four regular season innings after September 4. Merritt started Game 5 against Baltimore, but was unable to get through the second inning. Simpson started 8–1 and had 14 wins by July 26, but was shelved thereafter. He did not pitch in the post season. Right-hander Gary Nolan (18–7, 3.26 ERA) would assume the ace role for the Reds.

By contrast, pitching was a strength for the Baltimore Orioles as manager Earl Weaver had three, healthy 20-game winners. Mike Cuellar (24–8, 3.48 ERA), Dave McNally (24–9, 3.22) and future Hall of Famer Jim Palmer (20–10, 2.71) were all well-rested and ready for the Series. Weaver balanced good pitching with the hitting of 1970 AL MVP Boog Powell (35, 114, .297), Merv Rettenmund (18, 58, .322), as well as future Hall of Famers Frank Robinson (25, 78, .306) and Brooks Robinson (18, 94, .276). The Orioles led the AL in most runs scored (792), fewest runs allowed (574), complete games (60), lowest team ERA (3.15) and they were second in the AL in fielding percentage (.981) establishing themselves as the most dominant Orioles team in the modern era.

The 1970 World Series appearance by Baltimore was the second of what would be three-straight World Series appearances. The Reds would go on to amass four WS appearances in a seven-year stretch (1970, &#x27;72, &#x27;75 &amp; &#x27;76, winning the last two).

Of the four World Series Earl Weaver managed the Orioles to, the 1970 World Series was the only one that they won. They lost to the New York Mets in , and to the Pittsburgh Pirates in and .

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

The Reds got off to a fast start, taking a 3–0 lead off Jim Palmer on a first-inning RBI single by Johnny Bench and a third-inning two-run homer by Lee May. The Orioles&#x27; offense answered with a two-run homer by Boog Powell in the fourth inning, off Reds starter Gary Nolan. Elrod Hendricks tied it with a homer in the fifth, and Brooks Robinson hit the game-winning homer in the seventh. In the sixth, Robinson made a spectacular backhanded grab of a hard grounder down the line by May before spinning to throw him out. It was one of several spectacular plays the Gold Glove third baseman would make in the series.

The game turned in the sixth inning on a controversial call by home-plate umpire Ken Burkhart. The Reds had Bernie Carbo on third and Tommy Helms on first when Ty Cline, batting for Woody Woodward, hit a high chopper in front of the plate. Burkhart positioned himself in front of the plate to call the ball fair or foul as Carbo sped home. Baltimore catcher Hendricks fielded the ball and turned to tag Carbo with Burkhart blocking the way. Hendricks tagged the sliding Carbo with his glove hand while holding the ball in his bare right hand; all the while, Burkhart was knocked to the ground and had his back to the play. When Burkhart turned around, he saw Carbo out of the baseline because Burkhart was actually blocking Carbo&#x27;s direct path to the plate as Hendricks held the ball. Burkhart signaled Carbo out without asking for help from the other umpires. Replays showed that Hendricks tagged Carbo with an empty mitt, but Carbo also missed the plate on the slide, although, unwittingly, he stood on it when he argued the &quot;out&quot; call. Both Carbo and Sparky Anderson vehemently argued the call, to no avail.

Robinson&#x27;s home run put the O&#x27;s ahead for the first time, while Palmer settled into a groove on the mound. Palmer allowed no hits in his final innings of work. After he walked Pete Rose with two outs in the ninth, Pete Richert relieved Palmer and got Bobby Tolan to line out to shortstop Mark Belanger to end the game.

The Jackson 5 performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; prior to the game, with the Lemon-Monroe High School Marching Band accompanying the group in the performance. The events were re-enacted in the 1992 miniseries &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot;, with the group performing the song a cappella.

===Game 2===

Again, another fast start by the Reds fell by the wayside. The Reds scored three in the first on a two-run double by Lee May, who went to third when Orioles center fielder Paul Blair bobbled the ball. Hal McRae squeeze-bunted May home for the third run. They pushed the lead to 4–0 on a homer by Bobby Tolan in the third.

The Orioles began their comeback innocently enough on a Boog Powell solo homer in the fourth. In the fifth, the floodgates opened. With one out, Reds&#x27; starter Jim McGlothlin gave up successive singles to pinch-hitter Chico Salmon and Don Buford. Paul Blair singled home Salmon, chasing McGlothlin and bringing in Milt Wilcox. Wilcox gave up RBI singles to Powell and Brooks Robinson and the crushing blow, a two-run double to Elrod Hendricks.

The Reds would get back one run in the sixth on a Johnny Bench home run, but that was it.

American actor and singer Tony Martin sang the National Anthem prior to the first pitch, which was thrown out by former NL President Warren Giles.

===Game 3===


Left-hander Dave McNally had a banner day, pitching a complete game and scattering nine hits, while also connecting for a grand slam in the sixth inning off reliever Wayne Granger to break the game open. McNally became the first pitcher to hit a World Series grand slam.

Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson added to his highlight reel with a spectacular display of fielding. After Pete Rose and Bobby Tolan led the game off with consecutive hits, Robinson made a sensational, leaping grab of Tony Pérez&#x27;s hopper, stepped on third and fired to first for a double play. In the second inning, Robinson snagged a slow grounder hit by Tommy Helms and threw out the sprinting second baseman. And in the sixth, Robinson made a diving catch of a line drive by Johnny Bench. The Memorial Stadium fans gave Robinson a standing ovation as he came to bat in the bottom of the sixth. He responded by doubling to left.

The Orioles got two runs in the first on Brooks Robinson&#x27;s bases-loaded double off of Tony Cloninger. The Reds cut it to 2–1 in the second when Hal McRae singled, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Dave Concepcion&#x27;s single, but Frank Robinson&#x27;s home run in the third gave the Orioles that run back. Don Buford&#x27;s home run in the fifth extended their lead to 4–1. Next inning Dave McNally&#x27;s grand slam off of Wayne Granger blew the game open and put the Orioles up 8–1. The Reds got two runs in the seventh on Dave Concepcion&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Pete Rose&#x27;s RBI single, but the Orioles got a run in the bottom half on Paul Blair&#x27;s RBI double off of Don Gullett. The Orioles took a commanding 3–0 series lead with a 9–3 win.

===Game 4===

The Reds staved off a Series sweep thanks to clutch hitting by Lee May and stellar relief pitching by rookie Don Gullett and veteran Clay Carroll.

With a 2–1 lead in the third, Reds&#x27; starter Gary Nolan gave up two-out RBI singles to Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson. Gullett relieved Nolan and surrendered another RBI single to Elrod Hendricks. The Reds crept back in the fifth on a homer by Pete Rose.

Gullett gave up an unearned run in the sixth when Hendricks singled Brooks Robinson to third and Robinson scored when Rose&#x27;s attempted throw from right field sailed past Tony Pérez at third.

In the eighth, Perez walked and Johnny Bench singled off Baltimore starter Jim Palmer, who was then relieved by Eddie Watt. Lee May then slammed a three-run homer on the first pitch he saw from Watt to put the Reds ahead. Carroll, who had entered in the seventh, made the lead stand. Gullett and Carroll combined to pitch innings, allowing four hits and one unearned run. The Reds&#x27; victory snapped Baltimore&#x27;s 17-game winning streak which included the final 11 regular-season games and a three-game sweep over Minnesota in the ALCS. It also ended Cincinnati&#x27;s six-game World Series losing streak, including the last three games in the 1961 World Series.

===Game 5===

Rain showers threatened to delay Game 5, but it kept the Memorial Stadium crowd from being less than capacity. Seemingly re-energized from their Game 4 win, the Reds rocked Orioles starter Mike Cuellar for three runs in the first on an RBI single by Johnny Bench and a two-run double by Hal McRae. Cuellar stayed in the game and got Tommy Helms to ground out to Mark Belanger for the final out. The Orioles scored two runs in the bottom of the first against Reds&#x27; 20-game winner Jim Merritt, who had been battling a sore arm and had not pitched in 10 days. Merritt allowed two more runs in the second inning before being lifted.

Frank Robinson hit a two-run home run, Merv Rettenmund also had a homer and two RBI, and Davey Johnson had two RBI to pace the Orioles&#x27; attack. After the rocky first inning, Cuellar settled down and allowed no runs and two hits in the final eight innings for a complete-game victory.

Brooks Robinson won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award hitting .429, broke the record for total bases in a five-game series with 17, tied the record for most hits in one game with four, and tied teammate Paul Blair for most hits in a five-game Series with nine. &quot;Total Baseball&quot; described Brooks Robinson&#x27;s fielding with, &quot;other-worldly defense at third (which) gave Reds right-handed hitters nightmares through the Series.&quot; Upon hearing that Robinson won the MVP award and a new car from Toyota, Reds&#x27; catcher Johnny Bench said, &quot;If we had known he wanted a car that badly, we&#x27;d all have chipped in and bought him one.&quot;

The victory was redemption for Baltimore, who had lost to the underdog New York Mets in the 1969 World Series.

The game was the last in the majors for Ashford, who became the first black umpire to work at the top level of baseball, when he was hired by the American League in 1966. Ashford reached MLB&#x27;s then-mandatory retirement age of 55 in late 1969, but was allowed by AL president Joe Cronin to come back for 1970, giving him the opportunity to break the World Series color barrier for umpires. A black umpire did not call balls and strikes in a World Series game until 1993, when the NL&#x27;s Charlie Williams worked the plate in Game 4.

This World Series was the first in which both teams wore their last names on the backs of their uniforms. It was also the last where either team wore wool flannel uniforms. The Orioles gradually switched to double-unit uniforms throughout 1971, then went to them full-time in the American League Championship Series; their World Series opponents, the Pittsburgh Pirates, were the first team to don double-knits when they moved to Three Rivers Stadium in July 1970. The Reds, along with 15 other teams, moved from flannels to knits to start 1972.

===Composite line score===
1970 World Series (4–1): Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) over Cincinnati Reds (N.L.)
==Aftermath==
This was the second of three consecutive appearances by the Orioles, who went on to lose the following year&#x27;s World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates 4–3. Baltimore won both the Super Bowl and the World Series in the same season as the Baltimore Colts won Super Bowl V over the Dallas Cowboys. However, the city fell short of winning MLB, NFL and NBA championships within a one-year span as the Baltimore Bullets were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1971 NBA Finals. Such a scenario is now unlikely as the Bullets have since relocated to Washington, D.C. and renamed the Wizards.

For the Reds, this was the first of four World Series appearances in the 1970s. After losing to the Oakland Athletics four games to three in , they proceeded to win back-to-back championships in (4–3 vs. the Red Sox) and (4–0 vs. the Yankees).

<text>Howard Matthew Moses Long (born January 6, 1960) is an American former professional football defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons. He spent his entire career with the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders franchise, who selected him in the second round of the 1981 NFL draft. Long received eight Pro Bowl and three first-team All-Pro selections while helping the team win Super Bowl XVIII. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000.

After retiring, Long pursued a career in acting and broadcasting and serves as a studio analyst for Fox Sports&#x27; NFL coverage.

==Early life==

Born in Somerville, Massachusetts, Long was raised in Charlestown, Boston, primarily by his uncles and maternal grandmother.

He attended Milford High School in Milford, Worcester County, Massachusetts, and is a member of the Milford Hall of Fame. Long was an all-around athlete, playing football (lettered three years and was named to the Scholastic Coach All-America team as a senior, although he had never played football until age 15), basketball (lettered three years as a forward), and track (lettered three years, competing in the shot put, discus, and javelin). Long also set state records in the shot put and discus.

==College career==
Long played college football at Villanova University near Philadelphia and earned a degree in communications. A four-year letterman for the Wildcats, he was selected to play in the Blue–Gray Football Classic and was named the MVP in 1980. As a freshman, Long started every game and had 99 tackles. As a sophomore in 1978, Long led Villanova in sacks with five and recorded 78 tackles. The next season, Long sustained a thigh injury, missed three games, and ended the season with 46 tackles. As a senior in 1980, Long again led the Wildcats with four sacks and had 84 tackles. He began as a tight end but was moved to the defensive line, playing mostly nose guard his first two seasons. After moving to defensive end, he earned All-East honors and was honorable mention All-American in his senior year. Long also boxed at Villanova and was the Northern Collegiate Heavyweight Boxing Champion.

==Professional career==
Selected in the second round of the 1981 NFL draft by the Oakland Raiders, Long played 13 seasons for the club, wearing the number 75. On the Raiders defensive line, Long earned eight Pro Bowl selections.

He had high aspirations early in his career. He told&quot; Football Digest&quot; in 1986 that he wanted &quot;Financial security, and I want to be President. That&#x27;s my goal. And I&#x27;d like to win a few more Super Bowls.&quot; Along the way, he was also named first-team All-Pro three times (in 1983, &#x27;84, and &#x27;85) and second-team All-Pro twice (in 1986 and 1989). He was selected by John Madden to the All-Madden teams in 1984 and 1985 and was named to the 10th Anniversary All-Madden team in 1994.

Long was voted the NFL Alumni Defensive Lineman of the Year and the NFLPA AFC Defensive Lineman of the Year in 1985. He capped off a stellar 1985 season earning the George Halas Trophy for having been voted the NEA&#x27;s co-NFL Defensive Player of the Year (along with Andre Tippett). He was also named the Seagrams&#x27; Seven Crown NFL Defensive Player of the year. The following year, Long was voted the Miller Lite NFL Defensive Lineman of the Year. Both those awards were taken by polls of NFL players. In 1986, Long was voted to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl and was key in helping the Raiders record 63 sacks and being the number one defense in the AFC. From 1983 to 1986 the Raiders defense recorded 249 sacks, which tied with the Chicago Bears for tops in the NFL over that span.

Long collected 91 sacks during his career (7 are not official, as sacks were not an official statistic during his rookie year). His career high was in 1983 with 13 sacks, including a career-high five against the Washington Redskins on October 2, 1983. He also intercepted two passes and recovered 10 fumbles during his 13-year career. At the time of his retirement, he was the last player still with the team who had been a Raider before the franchise moved to Los Angeles. He won the Super Bowl XVIII title as the left defensive end with the Raiders (1983 season), beating the Washington Redskins, as he outplayed the opposing offensive tackle, George Starke; the vaunted Washington running game led by John Riggins had only 90 yards in 32 rush attempts.

Long&#x27;s signature defensive move was the &quot;rip,&quot; which employed a quick, uppercut-like motion designed to break an opposing blocker&#x27;s grip.

Pro Football Weekly (PFW) named Long as one of the ends on its All-time 3–4 defensive front, along with Lee Roy Selmon, Curley Culp, Lawrence Taylor, Andre Tippett, Randy Gradishar, and Harry Carson. PFW based its &quot;Ultimate 3–4&quot; team on the vote of over 40 former NFL players, coaches, and scouts.

==After football==
After his retirement from the NFL following the 1993 season, Long pursued an acting career, focused mainly on action films—including &quot;Firestorm&quot;, a 1998 feature in which he starred. He also appeared as a co-star in the suspense movie &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, alongside star John Travolta. He played a minor role in the movie &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot; alongside Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell and Courteney Cox. In &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;, Long appears as Mr. White&#x27;s (Tom Hanks) &quot;partner&quot; Lloyd in the extended cut of the movie, released on DVD in 2007. Long&#x27;s part was entirely cut from the theatrical release.

Long also made numerous cameo appearances on TV shows and commercials. Long was a spokesman for Radio Shack, making commercials with actress Teri Hatcher. He has also been featured in many other national commercials and advertising campaigns including those of Coors Light, Nike, Campbell&#x27;s Chunky Soup, Hanes, Frito Lay, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Nabisco, Kraft, the Bud Bowl campaign, Honda, and currently for Chevrolet.

In March 1986, Long told &quot;Inside Sports&quot;: &quot;When I&#x27;m finished playing, I&#x27;d like to stay in touch with football, through broadcasting. I&#x27;m qualified to give a certain perspective and I&#x27;m articulate enough to handle it.&quot;

After his retirement, Long began as a studio analyst for the Fox Network&#x27;s NFL coverage, where he often plays the &quot;straight man&quot; to the comic antics of co-host Terry Bradshaw, as well as writing a column for Foxsports.com. In addition, he hosts an annual award show on Fox, &quot;Howie Long&#x27;s Tough Guys&quot;, which honors the NFL players whom he deems the toughest and gives &quot;the toughest&quot; a Chevrolet truck. Long won a Sports Emmy Award in 1996 as &quot;Outstanding Sports Personality/Analyst&quot;.

Long is also the author of &quot;Football for Dummies&quot;, a book to help average fans understand the basics of professional football; it is part of the &quot;For Dummies&quot; series by Wiley Publishing. He is an alumnus of, and volunteers his time for, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. He was named the 2000 Walter Camp Man of the Year by the Walter Camp Foundation.

After his football career, Long became known for his use of a popular stock sound effect in the movie &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. During his death scene, the sound effect is used, which became known as the Howie scream.

* &quot;In&#x27;N Out&quot; (1984) – Groom
* &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996) – Kelly

* &quot;Dollar for the Dead&quot; (1998) – Reager

==Personal life==
Long met his future wife Diane Addonizio during his freshman year at Villanova; they married in 1982, and they have three sons. The eldest, Chris, is a retired defensive end, who played for the St. Louis Rams, New England Patriots, and Philadelphia Eagles, winning two Super Bowls in his own right. The middle son, Kyle, is a guard who played for the Chicago Bears, and played one season for the Kansas City Chiefs after signing with them in March 2021. His youngest, Howie Jr., works in player personnel for the Raiders. Long is a Roman Catholic.

<text>William John George Evans VC (16 February 1876 – 28 September 1937) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Evans first joined the Scots Guards in March 1894, and served during the Second Boer War. He left the Army in August 1902, to work for the NSPCC, and rejoined in January 1915. When he was 40 years old, and a Company Sergeant-Major in the 18th Battalion (3rd Manchester Pals), The Manchester Regiment of the British Army during the First World War, Evans was awarded the Victoria Cross for his deeds on 30 July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme at Guillemont, France:

Company Sergeant-Major Evans volunteered to take back an important message after five runners had been killed in attempting to do so. He had to cover about 700 yards, the whole of which was under observation from the enemy. He succeeded in delivering the message in spite of being wounded, and then rejoined his company despite having been advised to go to the dressing station. The return journey had again meant facing 700 yards of severe rifle and machine-gun fire, but by dodging from shell-hole to shell-hole he managed it.

Evans was captured following his VC action, and spent the rest of the war as a POW. His Victoria Cross, gazetted in January 1920, was the last to be gazetted for the First World War.

He died on 28 September 1937 and was buried with full military honours in Elmers End Cemetery, Beckenham.

His VC medal group are still held by his family and are loaned to the Imperial War Museum in London where they are on display in the Lord Ashcroft VC/GC Gallery.

<text>Major Cecil Leonard Knox VC (9 May 1889 − 4 February 1943) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Family background ==
Cecil Knox was born in Nuneaton in 1889, the son of James and Florence Knox. The family were prominent in civil and railway engineering and had become affluent through their majority shareholding in the Haunchwood Brick and Tile Company. Cecil was one of nine sons who all fought in the First World War. His brother Lt.-Col. James Meldrum Knox of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was awarded the DSO &amp; bar before being killed in action at the Battle of Asiago (1918), and another brother, Capt. Thomas Kenneth Knox, gained the Military Cross and bar.

==Details==
Educated at Oundle School, he was 29 years old and a temporary second lieutenant in the 150th Field Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 March 1918 at Tugny-et-Pont, Aisne, France, Second Lieutenant Knox was entrusted with the demolition of 12 bridges. He successfully carried out this task, but in the case of one steel girder bridge the time fuse failed to act, and without hesitation he ran to the bridge under heavy fire, and when the enemy were actually on it, he tore away the time fuse and lit the instantaneous fuse, to do which he had to get under the bridge. As a practical civil engineer, Second Lieutenant Knox undoubtedly realised the grave risk he took in doing this.

Between the wars he joined the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and suffered from a serious parachute accident. He joined the Home Guard at the beginning of World War II and achieved the rank of major. He died as the result of a motoring accident (his motorcycle having skidded on an icy road).

<doc id="1219662" wikidata="Q1144500" url="?curid=1219662" title="1969 World Series">
<text>The 1969 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1969 season. The 66th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles and the National League (NL) champion New York Mets. The Mets won the series, four games to one, to accomplish one of the greatest upsets in Series history, as that particular Orioles team was considered to be one of the finest ever. The World Series win earned the team the sobriquet &quot;The Miracle Mets&quot;. This was the first World Series of MLB&#x27;s divisional era.

The Mets became the first expansion team to win a division title, a pennant, and the World Series, winning in their eighth year of existence, becoming the fastest expansion team to win a World Series up to that point. Two teams eventually surpassed the latter record, as the Florida Marlins won the 1997 World Series in their fifth year (also becoming the first wild card team to win a World Series) and the Arizona Diamondbacks won the 2001 World Series in their fourth year of play. The 1969 World Series was the first World Series since to have games played in New York that did not involve the New York Yankees. It was also the first World Series in which neither the New York Giants nor Brooklyn Dodgers (as both teams had moved to California in 1958) represented New York from the NL; all subsequent World Series with a New York-area NL team participating have involved the Mets, who have been the only NL baseball team located in New York City since that era.

==Route to the World Series==
===New York Mets===

The New York Mets, who had never finished higher than ninth place (next-to-last) nor won more than 73 games in a season since joining the National League in 1962, were not highly regarded before the 1969 season started. In fact, the best that could be said for them was that because the National League was being split into two divisions that year (as was the American League), the Mets were guaranteed to finish no lower than sixth place. The fact that the Mets began the season by losing 11–10 to the then-expansion Montreal Expos seemed to confirm this. With three weeks to go in the season, the underdog Mets stormed past the Chicago Cubs, who had led the Eastern Division for most of the season, winning 38 of their final 49 games for a total of 100 wins and becoming the first National League Eastern Division champions. Third-year pitcher Tom Seaver won a major-league-leading 25 games en route to his first Cy Young Award; the other two top Mets starting pitchers, Jerry Koosman and rookie Gary Gentry, combined to win 30 more games. Outfielder Cleon Jones hit a (then) club-record .340 and finished third in the National League batting race, while his lifelong friend and outfield mate Tommie Agee hit 26 home runs and drove in 76 runs to lead the club; they were the only players on the team who garnered more than 400 at bats. Manager Gil Hodges also employed a platoon system like the Yankees of the Casey Stengel era, in which Ron Swoboda and Art Shamsky became a switch-hitting right fielder who hit 23 home runs and drove in 100 runs, and Ed Kranepool and Donn Clendenon added up to a switch-hitting first baseman who hit 23 more homers and knocked in another 95 runs. In the first League Championship Series, the normally light-hitting Mets, once again considered underdogs despite having a better regular-season record than their opponent, put on a power display by scoring 27 runs in sweeping the favored Atlanta Braves in three games.

===Baltimore Orioles===

The Baltimore Orioles, by contrast, were practically flawless and featured stars at almost every position. They breezed through the 1969 season, winning 109 games (the most games won since the 1961 Yankees) and became the first American League Eastern Division champions by 19 games, then brushing aside the Minnesota Twins three games to none in the ALCS to win their second pennant in four years. The Orioles were led by star sluggers Frank Robinson and Boog Powell, who each hit over 30 home runs and drove in over 100 runs; third baseman Brooks Robinson, perhaps the best-fielding hot-corner player in baseball history; and pitchers Mike Cuellar, Dave McNally, and Jim Palmer, who combined for 63 victories.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


With this win, the Orioles looked to be proving all the prognosticators right, as it was a dominant performance. Don Buford hit Tom Seaver&#x27;s second pitch of the game for a home run, which just evaded Ron Swoboda&#x27;s leaping attempt at catching it. The O&#x27;s then added three more runs in the fourth when, with two outs, Elrod Hendricks singled and Davey Johnson walked. Mark Belanger then singled in a run, followed by an RBI single by pitcher Mike Cuellar. Buford capped the inning off by doubling in Belanger.

The Mets got their run in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Al Weis. Orioles starter Mike Cuellar was the winner, allowing just that run in a complete-game effort.

Despite the opening-game loss, nobody on the Mets was discouraged. Tom Seaver – the game&#x27;s losing pitcher – said years later &quot;I swear, we came into the clubhouse more confident than when we had left it. Somebody – I think it was Clendenon – yelled out, &#x27;Dammit, we can beat these guys!&#x27; And we believed it. A team knows if they&#x27;ve been badly beaten or outplayed. And we felt we hadn&#x27;t been. The feeling wasn&#x27;t that we had lost, but &quot;Hey, we nearly won that game!&quot; We hadn&#x27;t been more than a hit or two from turning it around. It hit us like a ton of bricks.&quot;

===Game 2===


Mets pitcher Jerry Koosman pitched six innings of no-hit ball, trying to match Don Larsen&#x27;s World Series no-hit feat. Donn Clendenon provided him a slim lead with a home run in the fourth inning.

However, Koosman lost the no-hitter and the lead in the seventh inning as Paul Blair singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Brooks Robinson. But that was it for the Orioles&#x27; offense. The Mets pushed across a run in the top of the ninth on back-to-back-to-back singles by Ed Charles, Jerry Grote, and Al Weis, the latter scoring Charles. This proved to be the decisive run, and Orioles starter Dave McNally took the loss.

Koosman had trouble finishing the game, as he issued two-out walks in the bottom of the ninth to Frank Robinson and Boog Powell. Ron Taylor came on to retire Brooks Robinson for the final out and earn the save.

===Game 3===

Agee led off the game for the Mets with a home run off Jim Palmer, then saved at least five runs with his defense. With two out in the fourth and Oriole runners on first and third, Agee raced to the sign in left-center and made a backhanded running catch of a drive hit by Elrod Hendricks. In the seventh, the Orioles had the bases loaded with two out, but Agee made a diving grab of a line drive hit by Paul Blair in right-center.

Ed Kranepool added a home run and Jerry Grote an RBI double for the Mets, while Gary Gentry pitched shutout innings and helped his own cause with a second inning two-run double. Nolan Ryan, making the only World Series appearance of his Hall of Fame 27-year career, pitched the final innings (benefiting from Agee&#x27;s second catch) and earned a save.

===Game 4===


Game 4 was mired in controversy. Tom Seaver&#x27;s photograph was used on some anti-war Moratorium Day literature being distributed outside Shea Stadium before the game, although the pitcher stated that his picture was used without his knowledge or approval. A further controversy that day involved the flying of the American flag at Shea Stadium. New York City Mayor John Lindsay had ordered flags flown at half staff to observe the Moratorium Day and honor those who had died in Vietnam. Many were concerned, including 225 wounded servicemen who were attending the game, and Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn announced that the American flag would be flown at full staff at Shea for Game 4.

Tom Seaver atoned for his Game 1 ineffectiveness by shutting out the Orioles through eight innings. Once again, Donn Clendenon provided the lead with a homer in the second off Game 1 winner Mike Cuellar, who allowed just that run over seven solid innings. In the third inning, after arguing ball-strike calls too strenuously with plate umpire Shag Crawford, Earl Weaver of the Orioles became the first manager since 1935 to be ejected from a World Series game. At the start of the argument, NBC&#x27;s microphones picked up Crawford screaming at Weaver, &quot;You shut your goddamn mouth!&quot;

In the top of the ninth, Seaver ran into trouble. Frank Robinson and Boog Powell hit back-to-back one-out singles to put runners on first and third. Brooks Robinson then hit a sinking line drive towards right that Mets right fielder Ron Swoboda dove for and caught just inches off the ground. Frank Robinson tagged and scored, but Swoboda&#x27;s heroics kept the Orioles from possibly taking the lead. Elrod Hendricks then flied out to Swoboda to end the inning.

In the bottom of the tenth, Jerry Grote led off by blooping a double to left. Al Weis was intentionally walked to set up a force play and get to the pitcher&#x27;s spot in the lineup. Mets manager Gil Hodges sent J. C. Martin up to hit for Seaver. Martin laid down a sacrifice bunt, but Orioles reliever Pete Richert hit Martin in the wrist with his throw to first, and the ball went down the right field line. Rod Gaspar, running for Grote, came around to score the winning run.

Replays showed Martin running inside the first-base line, which appeared to hinder Richert&#x27;s ability to make a good throw and Orioles second baseman Davey Johnson from catching it. Subsequent controversy focused on MLB rule 6.05 (k), which says that a batter shall be out—with the ball dead and the runners returned to their original bases—if &quot;...In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire&#x27;s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base.&quot;

The umpires&#x27; judgment was that Martin did &quot;not&quot; interfere.

===Game 5===


Dave McNally shut out the Mets through five innings and helped himself with a two-run homer in the third inning, following a Mark Belanger single, off game 2 winner Jerry Koosman. Frank Robinson homered off Koosman two batters later in the inning as well, and the Orioles looked to be cruising with a 3–0 lead.

The Mets, however, benefited from two questionable umpire&#x27;s calls. In the top of the sixth inning, Mets starter Koosman appeared to have hit Frank Robinson with a pitch, but plate umpire Lou DiMuro ruled that the pitch hit his bat before hitting him and denied him first base. Replays showed, however, that Robinson was indeed hit first — the ball struck him on the hip, then bounced up and hit his bat.

In the bottom of the sixth, McNally bounced a pitch that appeared to have hit Mets left fielder Cleon Jones on the foot, then bounced into the Mets&#x27; dugout. McNally and the Orioles claimed the ball hit the dirt and not Jones, but Mets manager Gil Hodges showed the ball to DiMuro, who found a spot of shoe polish on the ball and awarded Jones first base. McNally then gave up Series MVP Donn Clendenon&#x27;s third homer of the series (a record for a five-game World Series that was tied by the Phillies&#x27; Ryan Howard in the 2008 Classic and by Boston’s Steve Pearce in the 2018 Series) to cut the lead to 3–2.

However, the &quot;shoe polish&quot; incident may not be such a simple, straightforward matter. On August 22, 2009, at the 40th-anniversary celebration of the Mets&#x27; 1969 Championship, held at their new stadium, Citi Field, Jerry Koosman stated in several media interviews that, in actuality, Hodges had instructed him to rub the ball on his shoe, which he did, and after that Hodges showed the ball to the umpire. Koosman&#x27;s claim does not necessarily mean that the ball did not strike Jones on the foot, nor does it even mean that the polish on the ball seen by the umpire was put there by Koosman – it is certainly conceivable that there was already a genuine spot of polish on the ball, which easily could have escaped Koosman&#x27;s notice as he hastily created the fraudulent one. In any case, Koosman&#x27;s allegation at the very least adds an intriguing layer of uncertainty and possible chicanery to an already legendary event. Koosman was known for his sense of humor, and his love of practical jokes when he was an active player. Therefore, his claim of having scuffed the ball against his own shoe could be a ruse. Besides, there are other stories which have been told about that incident, by other players who were in the Mets dugout that day. One of those stories comes from Ron Swoboda, who said during an interview on the Mets 1986 25th Anniversary video, that when the ball came bounding into the Mets dugout, it hit an open ball bag under the bench, and several batting / infield practice balls came spilling out on the dugout floor. According to Swoboda, one could not distinguish the actual game ball from any of the ones that spilled out of the bag. Hodges quickly looked down, grabbed a ball that had a black streak on it, and walked it out to the home plate umpire, who then awarded first base to Jones. 
In any case, this incident provided baseball with yet another entertaining legend, about which the absolute truth will probably never be known.

The Mets then tied the score in the seventh on a home run by the unheralded and light-hitting Al Weis. Weis hit only seven home runs in his big league career; this was the only home run he hit at Shea Stadium and, in fact, was the only home run he hit playing for the home team in any major league park. Weis led all batters in the series with a .455 average.

The winning runs scored in the eighth as Game 4 defensive hero Ron Swoboda doubled in Jones with the go-ahead run. Swoboda then scored when Jerry Grote&#x27;s grounder was mishandled by first baseman Boog Powell, whose throw to first was then dropped by pitcher Eddie Watt in an unusual double error. Jerry Koosman got the win, his second of the series. With two outs in the top of the ninth inning, Koosman faced Orioles second baseman Davey Johnson (who, coincidentally, later managed the Mets to their second World Series championship in 1986). After taking a pitch of two balls and one strike, Johnson hit a fly-ball out to left field which was caught by Cleon Jones. After a shaky third inning, Koosman settled down to retire 19 of the next 21 batters he faced, giving up a single and a walk.

Karl Ehrhardt, a Mets fan known as &quot;the sign man&quot; at Shea Stadium, held up a sign that read &quot;There Are No Words&quot; soon after the final out was made. The sign made an appearance in the Series highlight film. Immediately following the victory, thousands of fans rushed onto the field and the Mets were forced to retreat to their locker room. Bill Gleason, a sports columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times, alleged that this feat would not repeated again until Disco Demolition Night, an event which saw many people rush onto the playing field in Comiskey Park just before the second game of a doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers was scheduled to begin on July 12, 1979.

In all four Mets victories, their starting first baseman hit a home run: Donn Clendenon in Games 2, 4 and 5, and Ed Kranepool in Game 3. The expression, &quot;Good pitching defeats good hitting&quot;, was never more evident than in this World Series; Baltimore collected only 23 hits for a .146 batting average, both team lows for a 5-game series. After winning Game 1 in which the Orioles had only six hits, Baltimore only managed a .134 batting average (17-for-127) over the next four games. Boog Powell led the Orioles with five hits and a .263 average—but all were non-scoring singles (although one advanced Frank Robinson to third base to set up Swoboda&#x27;s defensive heroics). Don Buford collected two hits in four at-bats in the opening game, including a lead-off home run against Tom Seaver, but went 0-for-16 over the next four games. Paul Blair went 2-for-20, Davey Johnson 1-for-16, Frank Robinson 3-for-16, Brooks Robinson 1-for-19, Mark Belanger 3-for-15, and Elrod Hendricks 1-for-10. The Orioles offense only managed four extra-base hits off Mets pitching in the five-game series, all in the first and last games. The Mets won despite below-average performances from Jerry Grote, who went 4-for-19, Tommie Agee, who went 3-for-18, Cleon Jones, who went 3-for-19, Bud Harrelson, who went 3-for-17 and Ed Charles, who went 2-for-15.

==Aftermath and legacy==

The 1969 series was the second major upset by a New York team over a Baltimore team in a sport&#x27;s championship event in 1969. Earlier in January, the Jets, led by Joe Namath, upset the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in the Super Bowl, which also aired on NBC. Both the Jets and Mets called Shea Stadium home at the time. In addition, the New York Knicks eliminated the Baltimore Bullets from the 1969 NBA Playoffs; they also defeated the Bullets in en route to their first championship. As a result, New York became the first city to host a World Series and NBA championship within a year&#x27;s span.

There are several direct connections between the two Mets World Championship teams of 1969 and 1986. Orioles second baseman Davey Johnson flied out to Cleon Jones for the last out of the 1969 World Series; Johnson later managed the 1986 Mets to &quot;their&quot; World Series title. The pitcher on the mound for the last out of the 1986 Series, Jesse Orosco, had been traded to the Mets for Jerry Koosman (the pitcher on the mound for the last out of the 1969 Series) after the 1978 season. 1969 Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson earned a second World Series ring as the club&#x27;s third-base coach in 1986. However, Mets pitcher Tom Seaver was on the losing end in 1986, as a member of the Boston Red Sox (he did not appear in the 1986 World Series due to a knee injury). Also in 1986, the Mets&#x27; World Series championship was in conjunction with a Super Bowl win, this time by the New York Giants, who defeated the Denver Broncos, 39–20, to win Super Bowl XXI.

The Orioles repeated as AL East champs the next season, when they won 108 games, one fewer than the previous year. In the ALCS, they swept the Minnesota Twins for the second straight year to return to the World Series, this time, they were victorious in five games over the Cincinnati Reds.

Four years later, the Mets returned to the World Series despite an 82–79 record, but lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games.

In a 1999 episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, Ray and his brother Robert travel to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to see a ceremony honoring the 1969 Mets. The episode ends with the brothers singing &quot;Meet the Mets.&quot;

This series is a major plot point in the 2000 film &quot;Frequency&quot;. It is also a plot point in the 2012 movie &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, which depicts the last out of Game 5. The clairvoyant alien character Griffin (played by Michael Stuhlbarg) asserts, among other things, that the baseball pitched by Jerry Koosman was &quot;aerodynamically flawed&quot; because the horsehide tanner&#x27;s wife had left him, that Davey Johnson only became a baseball player because his father &quot;couldn&#x27;t find a football to give him for his eighth birthday,&quot; and that Cleon Jones would have been born a woman had his parents not had &quot;an extra glass of wine before going to bed.&quot;

In a &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot; story that crosses over with the Legion of Super-Heroes, Egghead goes to the future and refuses to trust the future museums because they say the Mets win the 1969 World Series.

==Composite box==
1969 World Series (4–1): New York Mets (N.L.) over Baltimore Orioles (A.L.)
==Broadcast coverage==
NBC televised the Series, with Curt Gowdy sharing play-by-play commentary with Orioles announcer Bill O&#x27;Donnell (for the games in Baltimore) and Mets announcer Lindsey Nelson (for the games in New York). Tony Kubek served as field reporter and in-stands interviewer. Jim Simpson hosted pre-game coverage along with Sandy Koufax and Mickey Mantle. NBC Radio also broadcast the games, with Simpson splitting play-by-play with Mets announcer Ralph Kiner (for the games in Baltimore) and O&#x27;Donnell (for the games in New York).

NBC&#x27;s telecasts of Games 1 and 2 have since been preserved on kinescope by the CBC. Meanwhile, Games 3–5 exist in their original color videotape quality from &quot;truck feeds&quot;, including the pre-game coverage with Simpson, Koufax and Mantle.

<text>Tsat, also known as Utsat, Utset, Hainan Cham, or Huíhuī (), is an Austronesian, tonal language spoken by 4,500 Utsul people in Yanglan () and Huixin () villages near Sanya, Hainan, China. Tsat is a member of the Malayo-Polynesian group within the Austronesian language family, and is one of the Chamic languages originating on the coast of present-day Vietnam.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
*Sounds /ts, s/ may also be pronounced as [tɕ, ɕ] when before /i/.

=== Vowels ===
* Final glide sounds [j, w] may also occur as a realization of /i/, /u/ at the end of falling diphthongs.

==Tonogenesis==
Hainan Cham tones correspond to various Proto-Chamic sounds.

== History ==
Unusually for an Austronesian language, Tsat has developed into a tonal language, probably as a result of areal linguistic effects and contact with the diverse tonal languages spoken on Hainan including varieties of Chinese such as Hainanese and Standard Chinese, Tai–Kadai languages such as the Hlai languages, and Hmong–Mien languages such as Kim Mun.

<text>Cantometrics (&quot;song measurements&quot;) is a method developed by Alan Lomax and a team of researchers for relating elements of the world&#x27;s traditional vocal music (or folk songs) to features of social organization as defined via George Murdock&#x27;s Human Relations Area Files, resulting in a taxonomy of expressive human communications style. Lomax defined Cantometrics as the study of singing as normative expressive behavior and maintained that Cantometrics reveals folk performance style to be a &quot;systems-maintaining framework&quot; which models key patterns of co-action in everyday life. His work on Cantometrics gave rise to further comparative studies of aspects of human communication in relation to culture, including: Choreometrics, Parlametrics, Phonotactics (an analysis of vowel frequency in speech), and Minutage (a study of breath management).

Instead of the traditional Western musicological descriptive criteria of pitch, rhythm, and harmony, Cantometrics employs 37 style factors developed by Lomax and his team in consultation with specialists in linguistics, otolaryngology and voice therapy. The vocal style factors were designed to be easily rated by observers on a five-point scale according to their presence or absence. They include, for example: group cohesion in singing; orchestral organization; tense or relaxed vocal quality; breathiness; short or long phrases; rasp (vocal grating, such as associated, for example with the singing of Louis Armstrong); presence and percentage of vocables versus meaningful words); and melisma (ornamentation), to name a few.

In the early stages of his work on the Cantometrics coding system, Lomax wrote of the relationship of musical style to culture:&quot;Its fundamental diagnostic traits appear to be vocal quality (color, timbre, normal pitch, attack, type of melodic ornamentation, etc.) and the degree in which song is normally monodic or polyphonic. The determinative socio-psychological factors seem to be . . . the type of social organization, the pattern of erotic life, and the treatment of children... I myself believe that the voice quality is the root [diagnostic] element. From this socio-psychological complex there seem to arise a complex of habitual musical practices which we call musical style&quot; 
==History of the theory==

Lomax first publicly proposed the Cantometrics project in 1959 and launched a group project in conjunction with the Anthropology Department at Columbia University to implement his vision. Early collaborators included musicologist Victor Grauer, who was the first co-creator with Lomax of the Cantometrics computer coding system. Subsequent project members included distinguished Columbia University anthropologist Conrad M. Arensberg, a founder of applied anthropology; anthropologists Edwin Erickson and Barbara Ayres; and statistician Norman Berkowitz. Laban shape notation specialist Irmgard Bartenieff and dancer and movement therapist Forrestine Paulay co-created the Choreometrics movement coding system, for analyzing dance, mapping the movement of the torso, hands, feet, and use of performance space. In 1968 Lomax&#x27;s research team published a book, &quot;Folk Song Style and Culture&quot;, in which they stated that, &quot;for the first time, predictable and universal relationships have been established between the expressive and communication processes, on the one hand, and social structure and culture pattern, on the other&quot;.

Gideon D&#x27;Arcangelo, a member of the Cantometrics team, described their work this way:Using 37 criteria of observation, the Cantometrics team analyzed over 4,000 songs – around 10 representative songs from over 400 cultures. Each song profile they made was recorded on a computer punch-card and loaded onto the Columbia mainframe. A companion study of dance, Choreometrics, produced analyses of over 1,500 dance performances. Only a computer was capable of handling this enormous data set and looking for the patterns hidden within. The team, led by programmer Norman Berkowitz, developed a powerful set of statistically driven software tools to sort, separate, and group the performance data. Their analyses resulted in the first ever taxonomy of human performance style and in a series of maps showing the dis-semination of culture across the planet. These were presented to the American Association of Science (1966) and later published in the collaborative volume, &quot;Folk Song Style and Culture&quot; (1968).

==Results==

The Cantometric study of song revealed strong statistical relations between song style and social norms. Alan Lomax stated that the Cantometrics analysis amply justified his original hypothesis that sexually restrictive and highly punitive societies correlated with degree of vocal tension. The tendency to sing together in groups, tonal cohesiveness, and the likelihood of polyphonic singing were all associated with fewer restrictions on women. Multipart singing occurs in societies where the sexes have a complementary relationship.

Other results included strong correlations between length of phrase and precision of articulation, and degree of ornamentation with social stratification. It was found that explicitness or the information load of song varies with the level of economic productivity of the subsistence system.

Murdock&#x27;s taxonomy encoded the economic, social, and political features of more than 1,100 societies that ethnologists had studied up until that time. In many cases, these codes formed scales – for example, the one concerning the number of levels of political authority outside the local community, from 0 among hunters, to 4 for irrigation empires. Lomax and Arensberg arranged the codes into scales in order to measure the kinds of behaviors of features of culture, such as levels of production or permanence of settlement. When they added factors of expressive communication to the Murdock measures of social relations it produced a geographical taxonomy of human culture.

==Branching out into Choreometrics==

Three chapters of &quot;Folk Song Style and Culture&quot; are devoted to Choreometrics. In chapter ten, &quot;Dance, Style, and Culture,&quot; Lomax, Bartenieff, and Paulay describe the origin and meaning of the term: &quot;In order to distinguish the level of this comparative study of movement from the levels where previous investigators have worked, we have given the method a freshly-coined designation, Choreometrics, meaning the measure of dance, or dance as a measure of culture.&quot;. They wrote that:
Choreometrics tests the proposition that dance is the most repetitious, redundant, and formally organized system of body communication present in a culture... The dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and movement qualities most characteristic and most essential to the activity of everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity. By treating these elements redundantly and formally, dance becomes an effective organizer of joint motor activity. Dance supplies the metronome to meter and regulates, or orders the energy and attention of groups of people, and thereby acquires the weight of general community approval. Thus dance functions to establish and renew consensus at moments when a society, without further discussion or explanation, is ready to act in concert.

Bartenieff believed that dance (particularly traditional dance) was uniquely suited to Lomax&#x27;s type of analysis, since movement is &quot;not only a medium of expression but also the essence of communication. Although all dancers feel intuitively that movement communicates across culture barriers, she wrote, there have hitherto been no means for describing dance patterns so that they could be consistently compared cross-culturally:

&quot;The task on which we collaborated with Mr. Lomax was to adapt the Laban system to the problem of comparison of movement styles cross-culturally so that the main style families would emerge from the study of this visually perceived behavior on film, as in Cantometrics they had been found by study of aurally perceived behavior.&quot;

==Films==

A series of short documentary films demonstrated some of the results of the team&#x27;s statistical analysis in dramatic visual terms. These were: &quot;Dance &amp; Human History&quot; (1974) (40 min.), which examined two important parameters in the Choreometric study, the dominant trace form of the movement and single/multiple articulation of the torso and relates them to geography and type of society; &quot;Palm Play&quot; (1977) (27 min.), which examines the use of the palm in dance cross culturally; &quot;Step Style&quot; (1977) (30 min.), which examines the use of the foot in dance cross culturally; and &quot;The Longest Trail&quot; (1984) (59 min.), which uses Choreometric data as evidence that the Americas were populated by Siberian hunters. In 2009 all four films were included on the DVD &quot;Rhythms of Earth: The Choreometrics Films of Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay&quot; produced by John Melville Bishop (Media-Generation, 1974–2008), which included old and new interviews with the original participants of the study. Improvisational jazz musician and composer Roswell Rudd later collaborated with Lomax and Paulay on an unpublished study called the Urban Strain that used Cantometric and Choreometric analysis to study commercially produced twentieth-century American popular music and dance.

==Criticisms and responses==
The reaction of musicologists to Cantometrics was complex, as some critics questioned whether one could ever have enough statistics to prove anything about music and culture. One, Richard Middleton, called it an example of sociological homology.

The musical examples for Cantometrics had not been chosen randomly, however, but for their representativeness, following the scholarly guidance of specialists who had studied the regions and /or supplied the audio or film clip samples. This was done because it was found that style tends to be very repetitive, and in most instances relatively few examples captured the stable performance norms, so that in most cases, coding many examples per culture yielded little new information. Lomax and Grauer settled on about ten examples per culture for Cantometrics, which had the largest dataset. Ten examples per culture usually sufficed, although for some cultures one or more sub-styles needed to be sampled as well.

Alan Lomax himself stressed repeatedly that completeness of sampling was not the point:
The adequacy of any of these samples is . . . subject to this test: Will another sample of a similar kind taken in the same culture produce a similar performance profile? From this point of view, I believe that the majority of our samples will hold up. Even &quot;secret&quot; songs generally tend to be stylistically close to the more familiar music of a culture. The truth is that, with any one culture or subculture, singing is a rather standardized kind of behavior. It must be so since a main function of song is to . . . permit groups of performers to vocalize together and their listeners to share in a common experience. Cantometrics is a study of these standardized models, which describe singing rather than songs. Therefore, it is not primarily concerned with &quot;complete&quot; collections and descriptions, as are most scholarly endeavors, but with locating verifiable regularities and patterns. (Lomax [1968] 2000).

Victor Grauer noted that: “Cantometrics is a statistical method. Its patterns and correlations are based on multiple instances, not just one. There will always be exceptions, which is why statistical methods are generally preferable for comparative studies than the close examination of individual examples.”

==Cantometrics as an educational tool==
The Cantometrics team also created a set of teaching tapes that make it easy to develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. “Cantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,” Roswell Rudd told Gideon D’Arcangelo. “You want to know how it’s put together and then you want to know where the parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.” 
Alan Lomax foresaw that computers would be an ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to people of all ages and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world&#x27;s song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance. Since Alan Lomax&#x27;s death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.

<text>John Leishman McDougall VC (1839 – 10 March 1869) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was approximately 21 years old, and a private in the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot (later The Essex Regiment), British Army during the Second China War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 August 1860 at the Taku Forts, China, Private McDougall with an officer of his regiment (Robert Montresor Rogers) and a lieutenant of the 67th Regiment (Edmund Henry Lenon) displayed great gallantry in swimming the ditches and entering the North Taku Fort by an embrasure during the assault. They were the first of the British established on the walls of the Fort.

Until 1990 he laid in an unmarked grave. A campaign at that time added a stone to all unmarked VC winners. He is buried in Old Calton Cemetery. The grave lies to the north-east, not far from the main entrance.

==The medal==
The VC was stolen from the family home in 1960 and never recovered. The ribbon and bar are displayed at The Essex Regiment Museum, Chelmsford, Essex, England.

<doc id="1219670" wikidata="Q930043" url="?curid=1219670" title="Subcritical reactor">
<text>A subcritical reactor is a nuclear fission reactor concept that produces fission without achieving criticality. Instead of sustaining a chain reaction, a subcritical reactor uses additional neutrons from an outside source. There are two general classes of such devices. One uses neutrons provided by a nuclear fusion machine, a concept known as a fusion–fission hybrid. The other uses neutrons created through spallation of heavy nuclei by charged particles such as protons accelerated by a particle accelerator, a concept known as an accelerator-driven system (ADS) or accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor.

== Motivation ==
A subcritical reactor can be used to destroy heavy isotopes contained in the used fuel from a conventional nuclear reactor, while at the same time producing electricity. The long-lived transuranic elements in nuclear waste can in principle be fissioned, releasing energy in the process and leaving behind the fission products which are shorter-lived. This would shorten considerably the time for disposal of radioactive waste. However, some isotopes have threshold fission cross sections and therefore require a fast reactor for being fissioned. While they can be transmuted into fissile material with thermal neutrons, some nuclides need as many as three successive neutron capture reactions to reach a fissile isotope and then yet another neutron to fission. Also, they release on average too few new neutrons per fission, so that with a fuel containing a high fraction of them, criticality cannot be reached. The accelerator-driven reactor is independent of this parameter and thus can utilize these nuclides. The three most important long-term radioactive isotopes that could advantageously be handled that way are neptunium-237, americium-241 and americium-243. The nuclear weapon material plutonium-239 is also suitable although it can be expended in a cheaper way as MOX fuel or inside existing fast reactors.

Besides nuclear waste incineration, there is interest in this type reactor because it is perceived as inherently safe, unlike a conventional reactor. In most types of critical reactors, there exist circumstances in which the rate of fission can increase rapidly, damaging or destroying the reactor and allowing the escape of radioactive material (see SL-1 or Chernobyl disaster). With a subcritical reactor, the reaction will cease unless continually fed neutrons from an outside source. However, the problem of heat generation even after ending the chain reaction remains, so that continuous cooling of such a reactor for a considerable period after shut-down remains vital in order to avoid overheating. However, even the issue of decay heat can be minimized as a subcritical reactor needn&#x27;t assemble a critical mass of fissile material and can thus be built (nearly) arbitrarily small and thus reduce the required thermal mass of an emergency coolant system capable of absorbing all heat generated in the hours to days after a scram.
=== Delayed neutrons===

Another issue in which a subcritical reactor is different from a &quot;normal&quot; nuclear reactor (no matter whether it operates with fast or thermal neutrons) is that &quot;all&quot; &quot;normal&quot; nuclear power plants rely on delayed neutrons to maintain safe operating conditions. Depending on the fissioning nuclide, a bit under 1% of neutrons aren&#x27;t released immediately upon fission (prompt neutrons) but rather with fractions of seconds to minutes of delay by fission products which beta decay followed by neutron emission. Those delayed neutrons are essential for reactor control as the time between fission &quot;generations&quot; is on such a short order of magnitude that macroscopic physical processes or human intervention cannot keep a power excursion under control. However, as only the delayed neutrons provide enough neutrons to maintain criticality, the reaction times become several orders of magnitude larger and reactor control becomes feasible. By contrast this means that too low a fraction of delayed neutrons makes an otherwise fissile material unsuitable for operating a &quot;conventional&quot; nuclear power plant. Conversely, a subcritical reactor actually has slightly &quot;improved&quot; properties with a fuel with low delayed neutron fractions. (See below). It just so happens that while the currently most used fissile material has a relatively high delayed neutron fraction, has a much lower one, which - in addition to other physical and chemical properties - limits the possible plutonium content in &quot;normal&quot; reactor fuel. For this reason spent MOX-fuel, which still contains significant amounts of plutonium (including fissile and - when &quot;fresh&quot; - ) is usually not reprocessed due to the ingrowth of non-fissile which would require a higher plutonium content in fuel manufactured from this plutonium to maintain criticality. The other main component of spent fuel - reprocessed uranium - is usually only recovered as a byproduct and fetches worse prices on the uranium market than natural uranium due to ingrowth of and other &quot;undesirable&quot; isotopes of uranium.

== Principle ==
Most current ADS designs propose a high-intensity proton accelerator with an energy of about 1 GeV, directed towards a spallation target or spallation neutron source. The source located in the heart of the reactor core contains liquid metal which is impacted by the beam, thus releasing neutrons and is cooled by circulating the liquid metal such as lead-bismuth towards a heat exchanger. The nuclear reactor core surrounding the spallation neutron source contains the fuel rods, the fuel being any fissile or fertile actinide mix, but preferable already with a certain amount of fissile material to not have to run at zero criticality during startup. Thereby, for each proton intersecting the spallation target, an average of 20 neutrons is released which fission the surrounding fissile part of the fuel and transmute atoms in the fertile part, &quot;breeding&quot; new fissile material. If the value of 20 neutrons per GeV expended is assumed, one neutron &quot;costs&quot; 50 MeV while fission (which requires one neutron) releases on the order of 200 MeV per actinide atom that is split. Efficiency can be increased by reducing the energy needed to produce a neutron, increasing the share of usable energy extracted from the fission (if a thermal process is used Carnot efficiency dictates that higher temperatures are needed to increase efficiency) and finally by getting criticality ever closer to 1 while still staying below it. An important factor in both efficiency and safety is &quot;how&quot; subcritical the reactor is. To simplify, the value of k(effective) that is used to give the criticality of a reactor (including delayed neutrons) can be interpreted as how many neutrons of each &quot;generation&quot; fission further nuclei. If k(effective) is 1, for every 1000 neutrons introduced, 1000 neutrons are produced that also fission further nuclei. Obviously the reaction rate would steadily increase in that case due to more and more neutrons being delivered from the neutron source. If k(effective) is &quot;just below&quot; 1, few neutrons have to be delivered from outside the reactor to keep the reaction at a steady state, increasing efficiency. On the other hand, in the extreme case of &quot;zero criticality&quot;, that is k(effective)=0 (e.g. If the reactor is run for transmutation alone) &quot;all&quot; neutrons are &quot;consumed&quot; and none are produced inside the fuel. However, as neutronics can only ever be known to a certain degree of precision, the reactor must in practice allow a safety margin below criticality that depends on how well the neutronics are known and on the effect of the ingrowth of nuclides that decay via neutron emitting spontaneous fission such as Californium-252 or of nuclides that decay via neutron emission.

The neutron balance can be regulated or indeed shut off by adjusting the accelerator power so that the reactor would be below criticality. The additional neutrons provided by the spallation neutron source provide the degree of control as do the delayed neutrons in a conventional nuclear reactor, the difference being that spallation neutron source-driven neutrons are easily controlled by the accelerator. The main advantage is inherent safety. A conventional nuclear reactor&#x27;s nuclear fuel possesses self-regulating properties such as the Doppler effect or void effect, which make these nuclear reactors safe. In addition to these physical properties of conventional reactors, in the subcritical reactor, whenever the neutron source is turned off, the fission reaction ceases and only the decay heat remains.

== Technical challenges ==
There are technical difficulties to overcome before ADS can become economical and eventually be integrated into future nuclear waste management. The accelerator must provide a high intensity and also be highly reliable - each outage of the accelerator in addition to causing a scram will put the system under immense thermal stress. There are concerns about the window separating the protons from the spallation target, which is expected to be exposed to stress under extreme conditions. However, recent experience with the MEGAPIE liquid metal neutron spallation source tested at the Paul Scherrer Institute has demonstrated a working beam window under a 0.78 MW intense proton beam. The chemical separation of the transuranic elements and the fuel manufacturing, as well as the structure materials, are important issues. Finally, the lack of nuclear data at high neutron energies limits the efficiency of the design. This latter issue can be overcome by introducing a neutron moderator between the neutron source and the fuel, but this can lead to increased leakage as the moderator will also scatter neutrons &quot;away&quot; from the fuel. Changing the geometry of the reactor can reduce but never eliminate leakage. Leaking neutrons are also of concern due to the activation products they produce and due to the physical damage to materials neutron irradiation can cause. Furthermore, there are certain advantages to the fast neutron spectrum which cannot be achieved with thermal neutrons as are the result of a moderator. On the other hand, thermal neutron reactors are the most common and well understood type of nuclear reactor and thermal neutrons also have advantages over fast neutrons.

Some laboratory experiments and many theoretical studies have demonstrated the theoretical possibility of such a plant. Carlo Rubbia, a nuclear physicist, Nobel laureate, and former director of CERN, was one of the first to conceive a design of a subcritical reactor, the so-called &quot;energy amplifier&quot;. In 2005, several large-scale projects are going on in Europe and Japan to further develop subcritical reactor technology. In 2012 CERN scientists and engineers launched the International Thorium Energy Committee (iThEC), an organization dedicated to pursuing this goal and which organized the ThEC13 conference on the subject.

== Economics and public acceptance ==
Subcritical reactors have been proposed both as a means of generating electric power and as a means of transmutation of nuclear waste, so the gain is twofold. However, the costs for construction, safety and maintenance of such complex installations are expected to be very high, not to mention the amount of research needed to develop a practical design (see above). There exist cheaper and reasonably safe waste management concepts, such as the transmutation in fast-neutron reactors. However, the solution of a subcritical reactor might be favoured for a better public acceptance – it is considered more acceptable to burn the waste than to bury it for hundreds of thousands of years. For future waste management, a few transmutation devices could be integrated into a large-scale nuclear program, hopefully increasing only slightly the overall costs.

The main challenge facing partitioning and transmutation operations is the need to enter nuclear cycles of extremely long duration: about 200 years. Another disadvantage is the generation of high quantities of intermediate-level long-lived radioactive waste (ILW) which will also require deep geological disposal to be safely managed. A more positive aspect is the expected reduction in size of the repository, which was estimated to be an order of 4 to 6. Both positive and negative aspects were examined in an international benchmark study coordinated by Forschungszentrum Jülich and financed by the European Union.

==Subcritical hybrid systems==
While ADS was originally conceptualized as a part of a light water reactor design, other proposals have been made that incorporate an ADS into other generation IV reactor concepts.

One such proposal calls for a gas-cooled fast reactor that is fueled primarily by plutonium and americium. The neutronic properties of americium make it difficult to use in any critical reactor, because it tends to make the moderator temperature coefficient more positive, decreasing stability. The inherent safety of an ADS, however, would allow americium to be safely burned. These materials also have good neutron economy, allowing the pitch-to-diameter ratio to be large, which allows for improved natural circulation and economics.

== Muon-driven systems for nuclear waste disposal ==
Subcritical methods for use in nuclear waste disposal that do not rely on neutron sources are also being developed. These include systems that rely on the mechanism of muon capture, in which muons (μ−) produced by a compact accelerator-driven source transmute long-lived radioactive isotopes to stable isotopes.

== Natural ==
Generally the term &quot;subcritical reactor&quot; is reserved for artificial systems, but natural systems do exist—any natural source of fissile material exposed to cosmic and gamma rays (from even the sun) could be considered a subcritical reactor. This includes space launched satellites with radioisotope thermoelectric generators as well as any such exposed reservoirs.

<text>The Mississippi Republican Party is the Mississippi state affiliate of the United States Republican Party. The party chairman is Frank Bordeaux, and the party is based in Jackson, Mississippi. The original Republican Party of Mississippi was founded following the American Civil War, and the current incarnation of the Mississippi Republican Party was founded in 1956. The party would grow in popularity after the 1964 Civil Rights Act and is currently the dominant party in the state.

==History==

One-third of the delegates to the 1867 convention were black. James D. Lynch opposed the Radical Republicans and resolutions calling for property confiscation.

In 1956, Wirt Adams Yerger, Jr., an insurance agent from Jackson, founded the modern Mississippi Republican Party and served as the first state chairman from 1956 until 1966. He was chairman of the Mississippi delegation to the Republican National Convention in 1956, 1960, and 1964. He was elected to a four-year term as chairman of the Southern Association of Republican State Chairman in 1960. In 2009, the central committee of the Mississippi Republican Party named Yerger Chairman Emeritus. The Mississippi Republican Party would grow in supporters with then President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who still twice lost the electoral votes of Mississippi. On September 24, 1960, Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon campaigned in the state, the first time a presidential candidate had appeared in the state in more than a century. During the 1964 Republican National Convention Mississippi delegates would help nominate Barry Goldwater for president. Goldwater would go on to win 87 percent of the vote in Mississippi in the 1964 presidential election, the first time a Republican would win the state since the Reconstruction Era. Only once since 1956 has a non-Republican presidential candidate won the state of Mississippi, Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election. In 1988, Republican Congressman Trent Lott would defeat Democratic Congressman Wayne Dowdy to replace retiring Senator John Stennis (D-MS).

==Gubernatorial elections==

In 1963, Rubel Phillips became the first Republican nominee for governor in 80 years, challenging then-Lt. Gov. Paul Johnson, Jr. and garnering 38 percent of the vote. Phillips ran again in 1967 against John Bell Williams but lost again, this time earning 29 percent of the vote. In 1991, for the first time in over a century a Republican would become the Governor of Mississippi, when Kirk Fordice would earn 50.8 percent of the popular vote, defeating Democrat Ray Mabus. In the 2003 Mississippi Gubernatorial Election, Haley Barbour defeated then incumbent Democrat Ronnie Musgrove with 52.59% of the vote. On November 5, 2019, Tate Reeves was elected Governor of Mississippi and assumed office in January 2020.

==Policy positions==
While Mississippi Republicans take positions on a wide variety of issues, some of the noteworthy ones include:
* Abortion - &quot;Protecting and securing the &#x27;life, liberty, and property&#x27; of Mississippians begins first with guarding the life of the unborn child. Our policies should honor the sanctity of innocent human life.&quot; In November 2011, Governor Haley Barbour voted for Mississippi Initiative 26. Initiative #26 would amend the Mississippi Constitution to define the word &quot;person&quot; or &quot;persons&quot;, as those terms are used in Article III of the state constitution, to include every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the functional equivalent thereof.
* Voting rights - In January 2009, Republican Senator Joey Fillingane put forward Mississippi Initiative 27 which would amend the Mississippi Constitution to require voters to submit a government issued photo identification before being allowed to vote. This initiative passed on November 8, 2011.
* Private property - Republican Party members supported Mississippi Initiative 31 on the topic of eminent domain. Initiative #31 would amend the Mississippi Constitution to prohibit state and local government from taking private property by eminent domain and then conveying it to other persons or private businesses for a period of 10 years after acquisition.

==Current Republican officeholders==
The Mississippi Republican Party hold all the eight statewide offices and holds a majority in the Mississippi Senate. Republicans also hold both of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats and 3 of the state&#x27;s 4 U.S. House seats.

<doc id="1219685" wikidata="Q152392" url="?curid=1219685" title="Swadesh list">
<text>A Swadesh list () is a compilation of tentatively universal concepts for the purposes of lexicostatistics. That is, a Swadesh list is a list of forms and concepts which all languages, without exception, have terms for, such as star, hand, water, kill, sleep, and so forth. The number of such terms is small – a few hundred at most, or possibly less than a hundred. The inclusion or exclusion of many terms is subject to debate among linguists; thus, there are several different lists, and some authors may refer to &quot;Swadesh lists&quot;. The Swadesh list is named after linguist Morris Swadesh.

Translations of a Swadesh list into a set of languages allow for researchers to quantify the interrelatedness of those languages. Swadesh lists are used in lexicostatistics (the quantitative assessment of the genealogical relatedness of languages) and glottochronology (the dating of language divergence). For instance, the terms on a Swadesh list can be compared between two languages (since both languages will have them) to see if they are related and how closely, thus giving useful information that can be further applied to comparison of the languages. (Actual lexicostatistics is quite complicated, and usually sets of languages are compared.)

== Versions and authors ==

Morris Swadesh created several versions of his list. He started with a list of 215 meanings (falsely introduced as a list of 225 meanings in the paper due to a spelling error), which he reduced to 165 words for the Salish-Spokane-Kalispel language. In 1952, he published a list of 215 meanings, of which he suggested the removal of 16 for being unclear or not universal, with one added to arrive at 200 words. In 1955, he wrote, &quot;The only solution appears to be a drastic weeding out of the list, in the realization that quality is at least as important as quantity. Even the new list has defects, but they are relatively mild and few in number.&quot; After minor corrections, the final 100-word list was published posthumously in 1971 and 1972.

Other versions of lexicostatistical test lists were published e.g. by Robert Lees (1953), John A. Rea (1958:145f), Dell Hymes (1960:6), E. Cross (1964 with 241 concepts), W. J. Samarin (1967:220f), D. Wilson (1969 with 57 meanings), Lionel Bender (1969), R. L. Oswald (1971), Winfred P. Lehmann (1984:35f), D. Ringe (1992, passim, different versions), Sergei Starostin (1984, passim, different versions), William S-Y. Wang (1994), M. Lohr (2000, 128 meanings in 18 languages). B. Kessler (2002), and many others. The Concepticon, a project hosted at the Cross-Linguistic Linked Data (CLLD) project, collects various concept lists (including classical Swadesh lists) across different linguistic areas and times, currently listing 240 different concept lists.

Frequently used and widely available on the internet, is the version by Isidore Dyen (1992, 200 meanings of 95 language variants). Since 2010, a team around Michael Dunn has tried to update and enhance that list.

== Principle ==
In origin, the words in the Swadesh lists were chosen for their universal, culturally independent availability in as many languages as possible, regardless of their stability (how prone the word is to changing, as all words do over time to a greater or lesser extent, which can include borrowing from another language).

However, stability may be important. The stability of terms on a Swadesh list under language change and the potential use of this fact for purposes of glottochronology (study of how languages develop and branch apart over time) have been analyzed by numerous authors, including Marisa Lohr 1999, 2000.

The Swadesh list was put together by Morris Swadesh on the basis of his intuition. Similar more recent lists, such as the Dolgopolsky list (1964) or the Leipzig–Jakarta list (2009), are based on systematic data from many different languages, but they are not yet as widely known nor as widely used as the Swadesh list.

== Usage in lexicostatistics and glottochronology ==
Lexicostatistical test lists are used in lexicostatistics to define subgroupings of languages, and in glottochronology to &quot;provide dates for branching points in the tree&quot;. The task of defining (and counting the number) of cognate words in the list is far from trivial, and often is subject to dispute, because cognates do not necessarily look similar, and recognition of cognates presupposes knowledge of the sound laws of the respective languages.

==Swadesh 100 original final list==
Swadesh&#x27;s final list, published in 1971, contains 100 terms. Explanations of the terms can be found in Swadesh 1952 or, where noted by a dagger (†), in Swadesh 1955. Note that only this original sequence clarifies the correct meaning which is lost in an alphabetical order, e.g., in the case &quot;27. bark&quot; (originally without the specification here added).

 &quot;Claw&quot; was only added in 1955, but again replaced by many well-known specialists with (finger)nail, because expressions for &quot;claw&quot; are not available in many old, extinct, or lesser known languages.

The 110-item Global Lexicostatistical Database list uses the original 100-item Swadesh list, in addition to 10 other words from the Swadesh–Yakhontov list.

==Swadesh 207 list==
The most used list nowadays is the Swadesh 207-word list, adapted from Swadesh 1952.

In Wiktionary (&quot;&quot;), Panlex and in Palisto&#x27;s &quot;Swadesh Word List of Indo-European languages&quot;, hundreds of Swadesh lists in this form can be found.

==Shorter lists==
The Swadesh–Yakhontov list is a 35-word subset of the Swadesh list posited as especially stable by Russian linguist Sergei Yakhontov around the 1960s, although the list was only officially published in 1991. It has been used in lexicostatistics by linguists such as Sergei Starostin. With their Swadesh numbers, they are:

Holman &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) found that in identifying the relationships between Chinese dialects the Swadesh–Yakhontov list was less accurate than the original Swadesh-100 list. Further they found that a different (40-word) list (also known as the ASJP list) was just as accurate as the Swadesh-100 list. However, they calculated the relative stability of the words by comparing retentions between languages in established language families. They found no statistically significant difference in the correlations in the families of the Old versus the New World.

The ranked Swadesh-100 list, with Swadesh numbers and relative stability, is as follows (Holman &quot;et al.,&quot; Appendix. Asterisked words appear on the 40-word list):

===Sign languages===
In studying the sign languages of Vietnam and Thailand, linguist James Woodward noted that the traditional Swadesh list applied to spoken languages was unsuited for sign languages. The Swadesh list results in overestimation of the relationships between sign languages, due to indexical signs such as pronouns and parts of the body. The modified list is as follows, in mostly alphabetical order:

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Ferdinand Simeon Le Quesne, VC (25 December 1863 – 14 April 1950) was a British Army surgeon and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Le Quesne was educated at King&#x27;s College London before he joined the British Army as surgeon captain on 28 July 1886. After the Third Anglo-Burmese War, local leaders started a guerilla war against the British forces who now occupied the country. Le Quesne&#x27;s action was during this period. He was 25 years old, and a surgeon in the Army Medical Service (later the Royal Army Medical Corps) serving with the Chin Field Force in Burma when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

==Further information==
Le Quesne served with the Chin-Lushai expeditionary force in 1890, and with the Wuntho Field Force in 1891, and was promoted to surgeon major on 28 July 1898. He served in the Second Boer War in South Africa, from which he returned in August 1902. He later served in World War I, and retired in 1918 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==The medal==
His VC is held at the Jersey Museum in St Helier.

<text>Brian Henton (born 19 September 1946) is a former racing driver from England. He won both 1974 British Formula Three Championships and the 1980 European Formula Two Championship. He participated in 38 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 19 July 1975, but never scored any championship points.

Henton (nicknamed &quot;Superhen&quot; in the British racing press) came from a modest council house background and did not start racing until he was 23. On winning the minor British Formula Vee championship in 1971, ever-conscious of the value of public relations, he announced that he was going to be World Champion. This aim eluded him, but he enjoyed a successful career in Formula Three and Formula Two.

Henton&#x27;s F1 debut came in 1975 for Lotus, theoretically a good drive but the team was in turmoil with the Lotus 72 finally uncompetitive and its replacement the Lotus 76 a failure, so nothing concrete was achieved. Between 1975 and 1978 he mixed Formula One and Formula Two drives (including a spell in a private March for his own British Formula One Racing Team), never quite establishing himself in either category, but clinched the 1980 F2 championship for Toleman, who took him into F1 for 1981. The first Toleman-Hart was something of a disaster, overweight and underdeveloped, and Henton only managed to qualify once. Unfruitful outings for Arrows and Tyrrell in 1982 led to no more success, though he did set the fastest lap at the British Grand Prix - Henton is the only driver in Formula One history to have set a fastest lap without ever scoring a championship point.

Perhaps fittingly, his last Formula One outing was at the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch in April 1983, which also turned out to be the last non-championship F1 race in the modern era.

Following his retirement from the sport, he returned to running a car dealership and later moved into property development and in recent years has diversified into other areas, notably engineering. He has occasionally driven at historic events and holds equestrian events at his home in Ingarsby Hall, Leicestershire.

<text>Colonel Edmund Baron Hartley VC CMG (6 May 1847 – 20 March 1919) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Hartley was born in Ivybridge, Devon, England, on 6 May 1847. Hartley arrived in Basutoland from Cape Town in 1875, becoming the first district surgeon in the colony. He was based in Maseru, but frequently traveled across the colony to treat patients. Following the outbreak of the 1879 Morosi&#x27;s Revolt he served as the principal medical officer of the Cape Colonial Forces. During the course of the campaign he organised his principal hospital at Fort Hartley on the Orange River. He distinguished himself during the campaign earning the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions. Which bore the following citation:

On 5 June 1879 in South Africa, Surgeon Major Hartley attended the wounded under fire at the unsuccessful attack at Morosi&#x27;s Mountain. From an exposed position, on open ground, he carried in his arms a wounded corporal of the Cape Mounted Riflemen. The surgeon major then returned under severe enemy fire in order to dress the wounds of the other men of the storming party.

Hartley continued his service as the principal medical officer of the Cape troops during the subsequent Basuto Gun War.

==Later service==

He later achieved the rank of surgeon colonel and, in March 1900 during the Second Boer War fighting at Aliwal, he is mentioned doing ambulance work, ferrying away the wounded under fire.

In November 1900 he was reported wounded following the occupation of Philippolis by Lovat Scouts and Seaforth Highlanders

On 19 April 1901 he was appointed a companion of the Order of St Michael and St George He died in Ash, Hampshire and is buried at Brookwood Cemetery.

==The Medal==
In 1955 the Victoria Cross medal was bought at Sotheby&#x27;s for the then record price of £300. It is now displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Mytchett, Surrey.

<text>Bruno Giacomelli (; born 10 September 1952) is an Italian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and .

Giacomelli won one of the two 1976 British Formula 3 Championships and the Formula Two championship. From to , Giacomelli participated in 82 Formula One Grands Prix for McLaren, Alfa Romeo and Toleman, debuting at the 1977 Italian Grand Prix. He achieved one podium, and scored a total of 14 championship points. He returned to Formula One in with Life, infamously failing to qualify in each of his 12 attempts driving the F190, prior to the team&#x27;s withdrawal after the .

==Early career==
Giacomelli began his career in Formula Italia, which he won in 1975. In 1976, he graduated to Formula Three where he competed with March and finished runner up in his first season, to Rupert Keegan, in the B.A.R.C Championship and won the B.R.D.C. title. He also led from start to finish in a March-Toyota in the 1976 Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race. His average speed was 74.84 miles per hour.

Giacomelli moved into Formula Two in 1977, working in close association with Robin Herd and the March factory. He retired from the Formula Two Pau Grand Prix in May 1977, after his car made contact with one driven by Jacques Laffite. However, he managed to score three F2 wins in 1977 (at Vallelunga, Mugello and Donington Park) and finished fifth in the championship. He also made his Formula One World Championship debut in 1977 in a third works McLaren M23-Cosworth at the 1977 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, retiring with an engine problem which caused him to spin off.

Giacomelli dominated the following F2 season. Apart from a third-place finish in the Mugello Grand Prix in May 1978 and a second-place in Vallelunga, Giacomelli won eight of the twelve races and won the title, beating the runner up Marc Surer by 29 points. Giacomelli became the first Italian to win the European Formula Two Championship.

==Formula One==

After his sole F1 race in , Giacomelli entered five races in for McLaren, when his Formula Two commitments allowed. He achieved his best finish, of seventh place, in the 1978 British Grand Prix. After winning the European F2 title, he switched to Alfa Romeo for their return to building F1 cars in . Alfa only entered their 177 and 179 cars in a handful of events that year, and Giacomelli could only achieve a best of 17th place in the 1979 French Grand Prix.

However, the following year the team looked more promising. Giacomelli earned a surprise 6th place qualifying position for Alfa Romeo at Brands Hatch for the 1980 British Grand Prix. Giacomelli posted a third-place qualifying time for the 1980 Italian Grand Prix at Imola. Three of his six mechanics sustained injuries on the Friday before the race, when their helicopter crashed en route to the track. He won the pole position for the 1980 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, New York in his Alfa Romeo. Giacomelli improved on his opening day time by 1.25 seconds, with a time of 1 minute 33.29 seconds over the 3.37 mile track. However, despite these flashes of speed Giacomelli only managed to finish three of the season&#x27;s fourteen races due to crashes or mechanical breakdowns; although two of his finishes were fifth places at the season-opening 1980 Argentine Grand Prix and the 1980 German Grand Prix, thus netting him four points and placing him 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

In , the car was somewhat more reliable, with Giacomelli being a classified finisher in eight of the season&#x27;s 15 races - however he struggled to achieve good results until the end of the year, with a fourth and a third in the season-ending Canadian and Caesars Palace Grands Prix respectively - the latter was Giacomelli&#x27;s only podium finish in F1, and he achieved his best-ever championship finish by ending up 15th in the drivers&#x27; standings.

For 1982 Alfa introduced their new Alfa Romeo 182 to replace the ageing 179, however, the new chassis proved to be unreliable in the first half of the season. In the second half, it was reliable enough to allow Giacomelli to finish all but two of the races, however, the year only yielded one points finish for him, with a fifth in Germany. Giacomelli was eliminated at the start of the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder when his Alfa Romeo collided with the two ATS cars of Eliseo Salazar and Manfred Winkelhock. Alfa recruited Mauro Baldi to partner Andrea de Cesaris for the 1983 Formula One season and Giacomelli joined Toleman. Giacomelli was outperformed by his teammate Derek Warwick, though he did manage to pick up a final F1 point at the 1983 European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch.

Giacomelli was the test driver for the Leyton House March team in 1988 and 1989, as well as in 1990 in its Leyton House incarnation. He was offered a test driver position with McLaren for 1990 but turned it down.

In 1990, Giacomelli returned to F1 with the Life outfit, taking over from Gary Brabham (who left the team two races into the season). The car, saddled with an ineffectual and fragile W12 engine, struggled to get within 20 seconds of the pole time at many circuits and Giacomelli failed to even get out of pre-qualifying at any of the 12 Grands Prix he contested with the team. At the Portuguese Grand Prix the team reverted to a more conventional Judd V8 engine, but the car had not been adapted for the new engine and the team were unable to properly fit the engine cover, leading to them pulling out of the event without completing a single lap. When Giacomelli was able to drive the Judd-powered car in Spain he found himself 18 seconds off the pace despite the new engine. With money in short supply and few hopes of improving their desperately noncompetitive package the team folded before the final two races of the season, ending Giacomelli&#x27;s F1 career.

==CART==

He made 11 starts in CART in 1984 and 1985, 10 of which were for Patrick Racing. His best finish was a 5th place on the Meadowlands street course in 1985. He attempted but failed to qualify for the 1984 Indianapolis 500.

<doc id="1219699" wikidata="Q171566" url="?curid=1219699" title="Red Bull Ring">
<text>The Red Bull Ring is a motorsport race track in Spielberg, Styria, Austria. The race circuit was founded as Österreichring (translation: Austrian Circuit) and hosted the Austrian Grand Prix for 18 consecutive years, from to . It was later shortened, rebuilt and renamed the A1-Ring (A Eins-Ring), and it hosted the Austrian Grand Prix again from to .

When Formula One outgrew the circuit, a plan was drawn up to extend the layout. Parts of the circuit, including the pits and main grandstand, were demolished, but construction work was stopped and the circuit remained unusable for several years before it was purchased by Red Bull&#x27;s Dietrich Mateschitz and rebuilt. Renamed the Red Bull Ring the track was reopened on 15 May 2011 and subsequently hosted a round of the 2011 DTM season and a round of the 2011 F2 championship. Formula One returned to the circuit in the 2014 season, and MotoGP returned to the circuit in the 2016 season. The Red Bull Ring also hosted a second F1 event named the Styrian Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021; and a second MotoGP event named the Styrian motorcycle Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic affected the schedules of both of those seasons.

==History==
===Österreichring (1969–1995)===

Originally built in 1969 to replace the bland and bumpy Zeltweg Airfield circuit located just across the expressway, the Österreichring track was situated in the Styrian mountains and it was a visually spectacular and scenic circuit. Although narrow at in all places, the track was very fast, every corner was a fast sweeper and was taken in no lower than third gear in a five-speed gearbox and fourth in a six-speed gearbox. It had noticeable changes in elevation during the course of a lap, from lowest to highest point. Like most fast circuits it was a circuit hard on engines but more difficult on tyres, because of the speeds being so consistently high. Many considered the Österreichring to be dangerous, especially the Bosch Kurve, a 180-degree banked downhill right-hand corner with almost no run-off area which, by 1986 when turbos pushed Formula One engine power to upwards of in qualifying, saw Derek Warwick speed trapped at in his BMW powered Brabham BT55 on the run to the Bosch Kurve. There were other testing corners such as Voest-Hugel, which was a flat-out right-hander that eventually led to the Sebring-Auspuff Kurve (this corner had many names over the years, Dr. Tiroch and Glatz Kurve were others) which was an essential corner to get right because of the long straight afterwards that led to the Bosch Kurve.

Some of the track was just road with little to no protection at all, even up to the final Austrian Grand Prix there in 1987, a race that had to be restarted twice because of two progressively more serious accidents both caused by the narrow pit straight in a similar manner to the 1985 race when the race was stopped after one lap following a start line shunt that had taken out three cars including championship leader Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari and local driver Gerhard Berger&#x27;s Arrows-BMW. In practice for the 1987 race McLaren&#x27;s Stefan Johansson narrowly avoided serious injury or worse when at over he collided with a deer that had made its way onto the track while Johansson was cresting a blind brow before the Jochen Rindt Kurve behind the pits.

Increasing speeds were also a concern at the Österreichring; during the final Grand Prix there in 1987 pole-sitter Nelson Piquet&#x27;s time for the of 1:23.357 set an average speed record for the circuit of . At the time it was second only in F1 average speed to Keke Rosberg&#x27;s pole lap of the Silverstone Circuit set during the 1985 British Grand Prix. Both times were set using a turbocharged Williams-Honda.

American driver Mark Donohue died after crashing at the Vost-Hugel Kurve in . In 1976, the Vost-Hugel Kurve was tightened and made into one right-hander rather than two right-handers with a small section between, and in 1977 it was slowed down and became the Hella-Licht chicane, going from the fastest to the slowest corner on the track. It is also known that four-time World Champion Alain Prost often said that all tracks can be changed but that the Österreichring should remain unchanged, just adding run-off areas would be fine, which eventually did happen up until the original track&#x27;s final year in 1995. The track was known for having many crashes at the start of races (especially with the Formula One&#x27;s cars wide at the time, until 1992) because the start-finish straight was very narrow (about wide), while most start–finish straights on other tracks were and it did not provide enough space for cars attempting to pass others, especially cars that stalled or broke at the start. Motorcycle rider Hans-Peter Klampfer died after a collision with another rider at the Bosch Kurve (where most fatalities happened) and 29-year-old Hannes Wustinger was also killed after a crash at the Tiroch Kurve (the part that was left out of the present circuit) at a race for the Austrian Touring car championship and this sealed the decision to build a new circuit.

Triple World Champion and long-time hero of the home crowd Niki Lauda is the only Austrian driver to win his home Grand Prix. He won the 1984 Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring driving a McLaren-TAG Porsche. Lauda went on to win his third and final championship in , beating his teammate Alain Prost by the smallest margin in F1 history, only half a point. He announced his permanent retirement from driving at the circuit before the 1985 race.

===A1-Ring (1996–2003)===
The Österreichring&#x27;s safety concerns had reached a head in the mid-1990s, and in 1995 and 1996 it was totally rebuilt, at the same site, by Hermann Tilke. Its length was shortened from , and the fast sweeping corners were replaced by three tight right-handers, in order to create overtaking opportunities. Its three long straights, as well as a twisty infield section, asked for a setup compromise.

As much of the construction work was paid for by the mobile phone provider A1, the track was renamed the A1-Ring. It proceeded to host seven Formula One Austrian Grands Prix between 1997 and 2003, as well as several DTM races and the Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix in 1996 and 1997.

===Red Bull Ring (2011–present)===

After the contract termination of Austrian Grand Prix, the circuit was sold to Dietrich Mateschitz in 2004. The grandstands and pit buildings were demolished in 2004, rendering the track unusable for any motorsport category.

In late 2004 and early 2005, there were intense discussions concerning whether the owner of the circuit, Red Bull, would find another use for the site, or return motorsports to the venue. There was a circuit extension proposal using part of the old Österreichring. In January 2005, return of motorsports seemed more unlikely than ever, as Dietrich Mateschitz publicly announced that he had no intention of wasting money on a deficient circuit. Throughout 2005 however, there was speculation of the newly founded Red Bull Racing renovating the track to use it as a test venue.

In 2006, Austrian racing driver Alexander Wurz claimed he would buy the circuit and have it renovated, but the idea never came to fruition. By 2007, talks involving Red Bull, KTM, Volkswagen and Magna International for a &quot;neuer Österreichring&quot; failed, after VW pulled out.

Late in 2008, Red Bull began their €70m reconstruction of the track and DTM chiefs considered a return to the circuit in 2009, and in September 2010, it was confirmed that the circuit, now known as the Red Bull Ring, would host a round of the 2011 DTM season. The championship has visited the circuit every year since then until 2018.

In November 2010, F2 announced that Round 6 of the 2011 F2 championship would take place at the Red Bull Ring. The circuit was reopened at a special event over the weekend of 15–16 May 2011, which included displays of various Red Bull-sponsored teams including Red Bull Racing. The FIA Historic Formula One Championship was invited to provide the headline race attraction with a race on each day for Formula One cars from the 3-litre period.

In December 2012, Red Bull contacted the FIA to say the track would be available to host a round of the Formula One World Championship in 2013, after a slot became available following the postponement of the proposed New York metropolitan area Grand Prix of America, and by July 2013, Red Bull announced that the Austrian Grand Prix would return as a round of the Formula One World Championship in 2014. The Austrian Grand Prix was held on 22 June 2014.

From 2014 until 2016, the track also hosted a round of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship.

On 11 February 2016, it was announced that MotoGP would return to the circuit in 2016 for the first time since 1997.

On 30 June 2019, in honour of the late 3-time Formula One World Champion Niki Lauda, the first turn of the track was renamed the &quot;Niki Lauda Turn&quot;.

On 30 May 2020, it was reported that the Austrian government had given permission for two Formula One races to be held on 5 and 12 July 2020 respectively to kick off the 2020 Formula One season after its start had been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 2 June 2020, Formula One confirmed the Red Bull Ring would hold back to back races on 5 and 12 July to start the 2020 season, with the second race styled as a one-off Styrian Grand Prix. It would also hold the first four races of the 2020 FIA Formula 2 Championship and the 2020 FIA Formula 3 Championship. This made it the first European circuit to host the opening round of a Formula One season since the Circuit de Monaco did this in the 1966 season as well as the first time Austria hosted the opening race of the World Championship and therefore the first time the circuit hosted the opening round - an honour given to 13 previous venues since the inception of the World Championship in 1950. The circuit also hosted back to back races of the 2020 MotoGP season on 16 and 23 August, with the second race styled as a one off Styrian Grand Prix.

In the 2021 Formula One season, the Red Bull Ring hosted two races again due to the Canadian Grand Prix being cancelled and the Turkish Grand Prix being postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first of the two was titled as the Styrian Grand Prix, with the second being called the Austrian Grand Prix. These two races a week apart from each other saw Max Verstappen winning both from pole position. Also in MotoGP, following the cancellation of the Finnish Grand Prix in May 2021, the Styrian Grand Prix was added to the calendar on the weekend of 6 to 8 August, one week before the Austrian Grand Prix. The first race saw MotoGP rookie Jorge Martín claim his and Pramac Racing&#x27;s first win in the premier class, whilst the second race saw Brad Binder take a shock home win for KTM despite finishing on dry tyres in wet conditions.

In January 2022, it was revealed that the circuit would be modified slightly for MotoGP and other motorcycle races, with a chicane being introduced at turn 2. However Formula One and other car racing series will continue to use the current layout.

<text>Jack Foreman Mantle, VC (12 April 1917 – 4 July 1940) was a sailor in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The award was made after Mantle had continued to operate his anti-aircraft gun during an air raid, despite being fatally wounded.

==Early life==
Born in Wandsworth, London, on 12 April 1917, Mantle was educated at Taunton&#x27;s School in Southampton. He joined the Royal Navy at the age of 16 and early in the Second World War, was mentioned in dispatches for shooting down an enemy aircraft.

==Victoria Cross==
Mantle was 23 years old and an acting leading seaman, when the action for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross took place during an air raid on Portland Harbour. His citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; reads:

The recommendation for the decoration was approved by Admiral Sir William James, the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth and was presented to his parents, John and Jeannie Mantle, by King George VI at Buckingham Palace in June 1941. It is the only occasion that the Victoria Cross has been awarded for action in British territorial waters. Mantel is buried at the Royal Naval Cemetery on the Isle of Portland, in the Church of England Portion, Grave 672.

==Legacy==
The Yeovil Sea Cadet unit carries the name T. S. Mantle V. C. in his honour.

A brass memorial detailing the incident and honouring Mantle can be found in Southampton Maritime Museum. It is placed to the left of the main entrance doors. This memorial was originally situated in &#x27;Jack&#x27;s Corner&#x27; at the City&#x27;s Central Sports Centre – the name remains as a children&#x27;s play area.

Mantle&#x27;s VC and other medals are on loan to the Royal Naval Museum in Portsmouth.

An inscribed stone tablet in memory of Mantel is at the Nothe Fort in Weymouth. It was unveiled in June 1987 at the 11th reunion of Foylebank Association.

In 2021, Mantle was remembered in the form of a new, permanent Portland stone memorial plinth, plaque and bench, overlooking Chesil Beach. This is situated opposite the Heights Hotel, Portland, Dorset.

<text>Reginald Frederick Johnson Hayward, (17 June 1891 – 17 January 1978) was a British Army officer and a First World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Hayward was born in Swartberg, East Griqualand, South Africa, the oldest son of Frederick Johnson and Gertrude Hayward, on 17 June 1891. He was educated at Hilton College.

He was 26 years old, and an acting captain in the 1st Battalion, The Wiltshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21/22 March 1918 near Fremicourt, France, while commanding a company, Captain Hayward displayed almost superhuman powers of endurance. In spite of the fact that he was buried, wounded in the head and rendered deaf on the first day of operations and had his arm shattered two days later, he refused to leave his men (even though he received a third serious injury to his head) until he collapsed from sheer exhaustion. Throughout this period the enemy were attacking the company&#x27;s front without cessation, but Captain Hayward continued to move across the open from one trench to another with absolute disregard for his own safety.

Hayward served in the Anti-Aircraft Command as part of the Royal Army Service Corps, during the Second World War. He was also commander of prisoner of war camps from 1945 to 1947, and achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

He died in Chelsea, London, in 1978.

His VC is displayed at The Wardrobe Museum in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England.

<doc id="1219705" wikidata="Q171963" url="?curid=1219705" title="Carel Godin de Beaufort">
<text>&quot;Jonkheer&quot; Karel Pieter Antoni Jan Hubertus &quot;Carel&quot; Godin de Beaufort (10 April 1934 – 2 August 1964) was a Dutch nobleman and motorsport driver. He competed in Formula One between and .

==Career==
Godin de Beaufort participated in 31 World Championship Grands Prix, becoming the first Dutchman ever to score points in the Formula One World Championship, and numerous non-Championship Formula One races. He was one of the last truly amateur drivers in F1, and ran his own cars – painted the vibrant Dutch racing colour: orange – under the &quot;Ecurie Maarsbergen&quot; banner, the team taking its name from de Beaufort&#x27;s country estate. In early years he was considered something of a mobile chicane, and a danger to other drivers on the track. However, in later years he matured into a competent and popular competitor.

Always a Porsche devotee (he only drove two World Championship races in anything else) he was a familiar sight at both Championship and non-Championship races in his orange Porsche 718, bought from the Rob Walker Racing Team. Although the 718 was outclassed even in its first year with him, he persisted with it as it was the only design into which he could fit his burly frame. The size of the car, and a streak of self-deprecating humour in de Beaufort himself, earned it the nickname &quot;Fatty Porsche&quot;. With stereotypical aristocratic eccentricity he often drove without shoes, and at his final race in Germany was even seen taking practice laps wearing a Beatles wig, rather than his helmet.

==Death==
Godin de Beaufort was driving the Porsche 718 in practice for the 1964 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring when the car suddenly veered off the track at the infamous Bergwerk corner. He was thrown out and suffered massive injuries to his head, chest and legs. Initially De Beaufort was taken to a hospital in Koblenz, but on the following day he was transferred to a major neurological centre in Cologne where he died in the evening.

<text>José Carlos Pace (; 6 October 1944 – 18 March 1977) was a Brazilian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Pace won the 1975 Brazilian Grand Prix with Brabham.

Born and raised in São Paulo, Pace competed in Formula One for Williams, Surtees and Brabham. He finished sixth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with the latter.

In March 1977, Pace was killed in a light aircraft accident in Mairiporã. The Interlagos Circuit in São Paulo was renamed the &quot;Autódromo José Carlos Pace&quot; upon his death, home of the Brazilian Grand Prix since 1972 and the location of his sole victory in Formula One.

==Career==
Pace was a contemporary of the Fittipaldi brothers, Wilson and Emerson, and began racing in Brazil in the late 1960s. He travelled to Europe in 1970 and competed in British Formula 3, winning the Forward Trust championship in a Lotus car. In he moved up to Formula Two with Frank Williams, but did not score any points from six races. Nevertheless, he moved up to Formula One in , competing with a Williams-entered March. He scored points on two occasions and finished eighteenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. His best result came at the non-championship Victory Race, in which he finished in second position. He also competed in some further F2 and Can-Am races.

For , Pace moved to the Surtees team and improved to eleventh place in the championship after scoring a fourth place in Germany and his first championship podium finish with third in Austria. He also set the fastest lap in both of these events. He also competed in three F2 races for Surtees, but his main racing activities outside F1 were in the World Sportscar Championship, in which he drove for the works Ferrari team. Sharing a 312PB with Arturo Merzario, the duo finished second at the Nürburgring and at Le Mans (after starting in pole position for the latter event), and third at Watkins Glen.

He remained with Surtees for and scored a fourth-place finish in Brazil, but parted company with the outfit mid-season after falling out with the founder, John Surtees. He drove a privately entered Brabham for Goldie Hexagon Racing at the French Grand Prix but failed to qualify, before moving to the works team alongside namesake Carlos Reutemann for the next race. After initially struggling with the new machinery, he finished fifth and set the fastest lap at Monza, and repeated the feat on his way to second, behind Reutemann, at Watkins Glen, securing a one-two finish for Brabham.

The Brabham team&#x27;s BT44B chassis were competitive throughout the season, allowing Pace and Reutemann to feature at the front of the grid. Pace duly took his first and only Formula One victory in front of his home crowd at the Brazilian Grand Prix, took his first pole position at the following race in South Africa, and also finished on the podium at Monaco and Silverstone, ending the season sixth overall in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and helping Brabham to second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, behind Ferrari.

He remained with Brabham for , but the car was much less competitive due to a change of engine, from Ford-Cosworth to Alfa Romeo. The Italian flat 12 units were larger, heavier, less reliable and less economical than their V8 predecessors, restricting Pace to fourteenth place in the championship, whilst Reutemann left the team before the end of the season.

By the start of the season, the competitiveness and durability of the Alfa engines had been much improved for Pace and his new teammate, John Watson. He demonstrated this fact by taking second position at the season opener in Argentina, and running strongly in the next two Grands Prix before suffering from mechanical trouble, but he was unable to capitalise on the improved performance for the rest of the season due to his sudden death.

==Death and honours==
Pace was killed in a private light aircraft accident near São Paulo, Brazil on 18 March 1977, 13 days after fellow F1 driver Tom Pryce and marshal Jansen Van Vuuren lost their lives during the 1977 South African Grand Prix. The Interlagos track, the scene of his only F1 win in 1975, was renamed Autódromo José Carlos Pace in his honour. Pace was buried in Cemitério do Araçá, São Paulo where his mausoleum went through severe degradation until July 2024, when his body was removed from the cemetery and buried under a bust placed near the main entrance of the Interlagos circuit.

In the 1977 motorsport film &quot;Bobby Deerfield&quot;, the eponymous title character is represented by Pace in the racing scenes.

<doc id="1219713" wikidata="Q1615191" url="?curid=1219713" title="Cardiac catheterization">
<text>Cardiac catheterization (heart cath) is the insertion of a catheter into a chamber or vessel of the heart. This is done both for diagnostic and interventional purposes.

A common example of cardiac catheterization is coronary catheterization that involves catheterization of the coronary arteries for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctions (&quot;heart attacks&quot;). Catheterization is most often performed in special laboratories with fluoroscopy and highly maneuverable tables. These &quot;cath labs&quot; are often equipped with cabinets of catheters, stents, balloons, etc. of various sizes to increase efficiency. Monitors show the fluoroscopy imaging, electrocardiogram (ECG), pressure waves, and more.

==Uses==

Coronary angiography is a diagnostic procedure that allows visualization of the coronary vessels. Fluoroscopy is used to visualize the lumens of the arteries as a 2-D projection. Should these arteries show narrowing or blockage, then techniques exist to open these arteries. Percutaneous coronary intervention is a blanket term that involves the use of mechanical stents, balloons, etc. to increase blood flow to previously blocked (or occluded) vessels.

Measuring pressures in the heart is also an important aspect of catheterization. The catheters are fluid filled conduits that can transmit pressures to outside the body to pressure transducers. This allows measuring pressure in any part of the heart that a catheter can be maneuvered into.

Measuring blood flow is also possible through several methods. Most commonly, flows are estimated using the Fick principle and thermodilution. These methods have drawbacks, but give invasive estimations of the cardiac output, which can be used to make clinical decisions (e.g., cardiogenic shock, heart failure) to improve the person&#x27;s condition.

Cardiac catheterization can be used as part of a therapeutic regimen to improve outcomes for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Cardiac catheterization often requires the use of fluoroscopy to visualize the path of the catheter as it enters the heart or as it enters the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries are known as &quot;epicardial vessels&quot; as they are located in the epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart. The use of fluoroscopy requires radiopaque contrast, which in rare cases can lead to contrast-induced kidney injury (see Contrast-induced nephropathy). People are constantly exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation during procedures. Ideal table positioning between the x-ray source and receiver, and radiation monitoring via thermoluminescent dosimetry, are two main ways of reducing a person&#x27;s exposure to radiation. People with certain comorbidities (people who have more than one condition at the same time) have a higher risk of adverse events during the cardiac catheterization procedure. These comorbidity conditions include aortic aneurysm, aortic stenosis, extensive three-vessel coronary artery disease, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and unstable angina.

===Left heart catheterization (LHC)===

Left heart catheterization (LHC) is an ambiguous term and sometime clarification is required:
* LHC can mean measuring the pressures of the left side of the heart.
* LHC can be synonymous with coronary angiography.

technique is also used to assess the amount of occlusion (or blockage) in a coronary artery, often described as a percentage of occlusion. A thin, flexible wire is inserted into either the femoral artery or the radial artery and threaded toward the heart until it is in the ascending aorta. Radial access is not associated with an increased risk of stroke over femoral access. At this point, a catheter is guided over the wire into the ascending aorta, where it can be maneuvered into the coronary arteries through the coronary ostia. In this position, the interventional cardiologist can inject contrast and visualize the flow through the vessel. If necessary, the physician can utilize percutaneous coronary intervention techniques, including the use of a stent (either bare-metal or drug-eluting) to open the blocked vessel and restore appropriate blood flow. In general, occlusions greater than 70% of the width of the vessel lumen are thought to require intervention. However, in cases where multiple vessels are blocked (so-called &quot;three-vessel disease&quot;), the interventional cardiologist may opt instead to refer the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; see Coronary artery bypass surgery) surgery.

===Right heart catheterization (RHC)===
Right heart catheterization (RHC) allows the physician to determine the pressures within the heart (intracardiac pressures). The heart is most often accessed via the internal jugular or femoral vein; arteries are not used. Values are commonly obtained for the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary &quot;wedge&quot; pressures. Right heart catheterizations also allow the physician to estimate the cardiac output, the amount of blood that flows from the heart each minute, and the cardiac index, a hemodynamic parameter that relates the cardiac output to a patient&#x27;s body size. Determination of cardiac output can be done by releasing a small amount of saline solution (either chilled or at room temperature) in one area of the heart and measuring the change in blood temperature over time in another area of the heart.

Right heart catheterization is often done for pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The pulmonary artery catheter can be placed, used, and removed, or it can be placed and left in place for continuous monitoring. The latter can be done an intensive care unit (ICU) to permit frequent measurement of the hemodynamic parameters in response to interventions.

Parameters obtainable from a right heart catheterization:
* Right atrial pressure
* Right ventricular pressure
* Pulmonary artery pressure
* Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
* Systemic vascular resistance
* Pulmonary vascular resistance
* Cardiac output
* Blood oxygenation

===Coronary catheterization===
Coronary catheterization is an invasive process and comes with risks that include stroke, heart attack, and death. Like any procedure, the benefits should outweigh the risks and so this procedure is reserved for those with symptoms of serious heart diseases and is never used for screening purposes. Other, non-invasive tests are better used when the diagnosis or certainty of the diagnosis is not as clear.

Indications for cardiac catheterization include the following:
* Acute coronary syndromes: ST elevation MI (STEMI), non-ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina
* Evaluation of coronary artery disease as indicated by
** Abnormal stress test
** As part of the pre-op evaluation for other cardiac procedures (e.g., valve replacement) as coronary artery bypass grafting may be done at the same time
** Risk stratification for high cardiac risk surgeries (e.g., endovascular aneurysm repair)
* Persistent chest pain despite medical therapy thought to be cardiac in origin
* New-onset unexplained heart failure
* Survival of sudden cardiac death or dangerous cardiac arrhythmias
* Workup of suspected Prinzmetal angina (coronary vasospasm)

Right heart catheterization, along with pulmonary function testing and other testing should be done to confirm pulmonary hypertension prior to having vasoactive pharmacologic treatments approved and initiated.
* to measure intracardiac and intravascular blood pressures
* to take tissue samples for biopsy
* to inject various agents for measuring blood flow in the heart; also to detect and quantify the presence of an intracardiac shunt
* to inject contrast agents in order to study the shape of the heart vessels and chambers and how they change as the heart beats

===Pacemakers and defibrillators===
Placement of internal pacemakers and defibrillators are done through catheterization as well. An exception to this is placement of electrodes on the outer surface of the heart (called epicardial electrodes). Otherwise, electrodes are placed through the venous system into the heart and left there permanently. Typically, these devices are placed in the left upper chest and enter the left subclavian vein and electrodes are placed in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus (for the left ventricle stimulation).

===Valve assessment===
Echocardiography is a non-invasive method to evaluate the heart valves. However, sometimes the valve pressure gradients need to be measured directly because echo is equivocal for the severity of valve disease. Invasive assessment of the valve can be done with catheterization by placing a catheter across the valve and measuring the pressures simultaneously on each side of the valve to obtain the pressure gradient. In conjunction with a right heart catheterization, the valve area can be estimated. For example, in aortic valve area calculation the Gorlin equation can be used to calculate the area if the cardiac output, pressure gradient, systolic period, and heart rate are known.

===Pulmonary angiography===
Evaluation of the blood flow to the lungs can be done invasively through catheterization. Contrast is injected into the pulmonary trunk, left or right pulmonary artery, or segment of the pulmonary artery.

===Shunt evaluation===
Cardiac shunts can be evaluated through catheterization. Using oxygen as a marker, the oxygen saturation of blood can be sampled at various locations in and around the heart. For example, a left-to-right atrial septal defect will show a marked increase in oxygen saturation in the right atrium, ventricle, and pulmonary artery as compared to the mixed venous oxygen saturation from the oxygenated blood from the lungs mixing into the venous return to the heart. Utilizing the Fick principle, the ratio of blood flow in the lungs (Qp) and system circulations (Qs) can calculate the Qp:Qs ratio. Elevation of the Qp:Qs ratio above 1.5 to 2.0 suggests that there is a hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunt (such that the blood flow through the lungs is 1.5 to 2.0 times more than the systemic circulation). This ratio can be evaluated non-invasively with echocardiography too, however.

A &quot;shunt run&quot; is often done when evaluating for a shunt by taking blood samples from superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC), right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and system arterial. Abrupt increases in oxygen saturation support a left-to-right shunt and lower than normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation supports a right-to-left shunt. Samples from the SVC &amp; IVC are used to calculate mixed venous oxygen saturation.
===Ventriculography===

By injecting contrast into the left ventricle, the outline of the ventricle can be measured in both systole and diastole to estimate the ejection fraction (a marker of heart function). Due to the high contrast volumes and injection pressures, this is often not performed unless other, non-invasive methods are not acceptable, not possible, or conflicting.

===Percutaneous or transcutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVR)===
Advancements in cardiac catheterization have permitted replacement of heart valves by means of blood vessels. This method allows valve replacement without open heart surgery and can be performed on people who are high-risk for such a surgery.

===Balloon septostomy===

Catheterization can also be used to perform balloon septostomy, which is the widening of a foramen ovale, patent foramen ovale (&quot;PFO&quot;), or atrial septal defect (&quot;ASD&quot;) using a balloon catheter. This can be done in certain congenital heart diseases in which the mechanical shunting is required to sustain life such as in transposition of the great vessels.

===Alcohol septal ablation (ASA)===
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the myocardium is thickened and can cause blood flow obstruction. If hemodynamically significant, this excess muscle can be removed to improve blood flow. Surgically, this can be done with septal myectomy. However, it can be done through catheterization and by injecting ethanol to destroy the tissue in an alcohol septal ablation. This is done by selected an appropriate septal artery supplying the intended area and, essentially, causing a localized, controlled myocardial infarction of the area with ethanol.

==Complications==
Complications of cardiac catheterization and tools used during catheterization include, but not limited to:
* Death
* Stroke
* Heart attack
* Ventricular ectopy and ventricular arrhythmias
* Pericardial effusion
* Bleeding: internal and external
* Infection
* Radiation burn
* Contrast-induced nephropathy from contrast use

The likelihood of these risks depends on many factors that include the procedure being performed, the overall health state of the patient, situational (elective vs emergent), medications (e.g., anticoagulation), and more.

==Procedure==
&quot;Cardiac catheterization&quot; is a general term for a group of procedures. Access to the heart is obtained through a peripheral artery or vein. Commonly, this includes the radial artery, internal jugular vein, and femoral artery/vein. Each blood vessel has its advantages and disadvantages. Once access is obtained, plastic catheters (tiny hollow tubes) and flexible wires are used to navigate to and around the heart. Catheters come in numerous shapes, lengths, diameters, number of lumens, and other special features such as electrodes and balloons. Once in place, they are used to measure or intervene. Imaging is an important aspect to catheterization and commonly includes fluoroscopy but can also include forms of echocardiography (TTE, TEE, ICE) and ultrasound (IVUS).

Obtaining access uses the Seldinger technique by puncturing the vessel with a needle, placing a wire through the needle into the lumen of the vessel, and then exchanging the needle for a larger plastic sheath. Finding the vessel with a needle can be challenging and both ultrasound and fluoroscopy can be used to aid in finding and confirming access. Sheaths typically have a side port that can be used to withdraw blood or injection fluids/medications, and they also have an end hole that permits introducing the catheters, wires, etc. coaxially into the blood vessel.

Once access is obtained, what is introduced into the vessel depends on the procedure being performed. Some catheters are formed to a particular shape and can really only be manipulated by inserting/withdrawing the catheter in the sheath and rotating the catheter. Others may include internal structures that permit internal manipulation (e.g., intracardiac echocardiography).

Finally, when the procedure is completed, the catheters are removed and the sheath is removed. With time, the hole made in the blood vessel will heal. Vascular closure devices can be used to speed along hemostasis.

===Equipment===
Much equipment is required for a facility to perform the numerous possible procedures for cardiac catheterization.

General:
* Catheters
* Film or Digital Camera
* Electrocardiography monitors
* External defibrillator
* Fluoroscopy
* Pressure transducers
* Sheaths

Percutaneous coronary intervention:
* Coronary stents: bare-metal stent (BMS) and drug-eluting stent (DES)
* Angioplasty balloons
* Atherectomy lasers and rotational devices
* Left atrial appendage occlusion devices

Electrophysiology:
* Ablation catheters: radiofrequency (RF) and cryo
* Pacemakers
* Defibrillators

==History==

The history of cardiac catheterization dates back to Stephen Hales (1677-1761) and Claude Bernard (1813-1878), who both used it on animal models. Clinical application of cardiac catheterization begins with Dr. Werner Forssmann in 1929, who inserted a catheter into the vein of his own forearm, guided it fluoroscopically into his right atrium, and took an X-ray picture of it. However, even after this achievement, hospital administrators removed Forssmann from his position owing to his unorthodox methods.
During World War II, André Frédéric Cournand, a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, then Columbia-Bellevue, opened the first catheterization lab. In 1956, Forssmann and Cournand were co-recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the development of cardiac catheterization.
Dr. Eugene A. Stead performed research in the 1940s, which paved the way for cardiac catheterization in the USA.

<text>Henry MacDonald VC (28 May 1823 – 15 February 1893) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
MacDonald was 31 years old, and a colour sergeant in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 19 April 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimea, Colour-Sergeant MacDonald acted with great gallantry when engaged in effecting a lodgement in the enemy&#x27;s rifle-pits in front of the left advance of the Right Attack. Subsequently, when the Engineer officers were badly wounded Colour-Sergeant MacDonald took command and he determinedly persisted in carrying on the sap notwithstanding the repeated attacks of the enemy.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of honorary captain.

==The medal==

<text>Francisco Adolpho &quot;Chico&quot; Serra (born 3 February 1957) is a Brazilian racing driver.

== Biography ==
Serra made his mark in International motorsport when he won the 1979 British Formula 3 Championship, one season after his compatriot Nelson Piquet had won the title. His performance caught the eye of Emerson Fittipaldi, he himself a British Formula 3 Championship winner in 1969, who signed him for his Formula One team Fittipaldi.

Serra debuted alongside Keke Rosberg on 15 March 1981 in Long Beach, finishing seventh. Serra&#x27;s result would turn out to be the best one for the team over the rest of the season. In 1982, with Rosberg moving to Williams, Fittipaldi resized the operation, fielding only one car for Serra. Serra scored his first championship point for finishing sixth in the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix. At the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix, Serra and countryman Raul Boesel made headlines for having a short scuffle after the qualifying session. Serra was furious at Boesel for blocking his last flying lap after waving Rosberg by. Boesel denied that this was intentional. Fittipaldi&#x27;s lack of pace meant that Serra occasionally failed to qualify. As the best of the non-qualified drivers, he was in contention for starting the 1982 Swiss Grand Prix after Ferrari withdrew Patrick Tambay&#x27;s entry but FIA rejected Serra&#x27;s request on the ground that Ferrari announced Tambay&#x27;s retirement, who on Sunday morning did not feel well enough to race, too late.

In 1983 Serra raced for Arrows. Despite scoring three top-ten finishes in his first four outings with the team, he was released after the 1983 Monaco Grand Prix and replaced with Thierry Boutsen. Overall Serra participated in 33 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix.

Following the end of his Formula One career, Serra made one CART Champ Car start in 1985 at the Portland International Raceway for Ensign Racing but suffered an engine failure.

Serra has participated in Brazilian stock car racing since the 1980s and was series champion in 1999, 2000 and 2001.

Serra was a good friend of Ayrton Senna as they both climbed the motorsport ladder at the same time. In 1981 Serra recommend Senna to Ralph Firman, who had his team in the Formula Ford 1600. In 1994 Serra refused to attend Senna&#x27;s funeral. In an interview with the Brazilian magazine &quot;Grid&quot; he said that he disliked the hypocrisy surrounding the event. &quot;There was too much pretence, which made me sick. Some people came a long way just to use the situation for their own good. These people never helped him, and they wanted to make us believe that they were great friends who were suffering so much. Going to the funeral was more beneficial to them than winning at Indianapolis&quot;.

Serra is the father of racing driver Daniel Serra.

<doc id="1219720" wikidata="Q3507535" url="?curid=1219720" title="Hana Zagorová">
<text>Hana Zagorová (6 September 1946 – 26 August 2022) was a Czech singer, actress, and presenter who recorded music since 1964. She is considered to be one of the most famous Czech singers. She won the national Zlatý slavík music award on nine occasions between 1977 and 1985, the second highest number of victories in the award&#x27;s history, after Lucie Bílá, who won the successor award, Český slavík, thirteen times.

==Career==
===1960s===
Zagorová first attracted attention in 1963 in the singing competition Hledáme nové talenty, where she was accompanied by the orchestra of Gustav Brom. In the years 1964–1968, she studied and subsequently graduated in acting at the Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Brno. In 1968, she released her first single, &quot;Prý jsem zýraná&quot;. In the late 1960s, she began to appear on television and performed with the band Flamingo.

She also sang in the ensemble Sodoma-Gomorrah (Zagorová, Jiří Štědroň, Viktor Sodoma) and she began collaborating with the Václav Zahradník Orchestra, with which she recorded her first album &quot;Bludička&quot; (1970). The record contained one of her biggest hits, &quot;Bludička Julie&quot;.

===1970s===
After moving to Prague, Zagorová began recording with Taneční Orchestr Československého Rozhlasu. From 1972 to 1974, she was a guest at Semafor Theater, where, among other roles, she played the character of Bludička, the theme of her 1970 album. Her popularity with listeners grew, and in 1974 and 1975, she won Bronze in the Zlaty slavík music competition, followed by Silver in 1976, and from 1977, she won Gold nine times in a row.

In 1977, she famously signed the &quot;Antichart&quot;, a petition opposing Charter 77.

Zagorová began appearing at concerts with her own backing band, and at the end of the decade, she performed several concerts across Czechoslovakia with Italian singer Drupi.

===1980s===
During the 1980s, Zagorová regularly filmed her musical TV show, &quot;Dluhy Hany Zagorové&quot;. She performed at many concerts at home and abroad, sometimes up to 360 in a year. She was well known in Poland, Germany, and the USSR. She also collaborated with a number of foreign artists, including Polish singer Irena Jarocka.

In 1980, she appeared as one of the leads in the musical film &quot;The Hit&quot; by director Zdeněk Podskalský.

From 1980 to 1986, she performed with the dance and singing duo of Petr Kotvald and Stanislav Hložek, and in 1986, she began collaborating with musician and composer Karel Vágner. During this period, Zagorová recorded seven studio albums, with the input of numerous established as well as up-and-coming composers, including Petr Hapka.

In June 1989, Zagorová signed the &quot;Několik vět&quot; petition, in which Charter 77 demanded the release of political prisoners and freedom of speech. Her activities were blocked by the government and she was not allowed to speak in public until the fall of the Communist regime. She resisted pressure to repeal her signature, instead standing her ground with the words &quot;There was nothing [in the petition] with which a decent person would disagree&quot;. She sang in public for the first time since the fall of the Communist regime in November 1989, together with Jaroslav Hutka, at Wenceslas Square in Prague.

===1990s===
In 1991, Zagorová switched from record label Supraphon to Karel Vágner&#x27;s Multisonic. She also travelled overseas, performing for her compatriots and fans in Canada.

After 1992, she began to limit her professional activity. According to her own words, she &quot;felt that she had already sung what she was meant to sing&quot;. She devoted herself to her new husband, Štefan Margita, whom she had married that year. During this period, Zagorová wrote screenplays for several TV shows and released compilations of her older songs.

From 1993 until 1998, she had her own television show called &quot;Když nemůžu spát&quot;. She recorded new songs for this show, mostly duets with her guests. The songs were written by Michal David.

Zagorová began touring again in 1996, and renewed her collaboration with Petr Kotvald and Stanislav Hložek.

She also recorded two albums with her husband Margita, and in 1998, she released her first original album in four years, titled &quot;Já?&quot;

===2000s===
Zagorová performed and toured extensively throughout the 2000s, mainly in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. She released three studio albums during this decade.

In 2006, she published a book of poetry titled &quot;Milostně&quot;.

In 2007, she performed on stage in Václav Patejdl&#x27;s musical &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, and two years later, in Michal David&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.

In 2010, public broadcaster Czech Television and Supraphon published a biographical book with a DVD and CD entitled &quot;Legenda – Hana Zagorová – Málokdo ví&quot;. Zagorová organized a concert at Prague&#x27;s Lucerna hall, during which Czech Television broadcast the recording.

===2010s===
In 2014, Zagorová won Supraphon&#x27;s Diamond Record for 10.5 million records sold and released the album &quot;Vyznání&quot;.

In September 2016, Zagorová celebrated her 70th birthday with a concert at a sold-out Lucerna, during which she announced her album &quot;O Lásce&quot;. It became the bestselling album the week it went on sale and was certified Gold. Two years later, Zagorová released &quot;Já nemám strach&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hana Zagorová was born and raised in the Ostrava region. Her father, Josef Zagora, was a civil engineer, and her mother, Edeltruda, was a teacher. Zagorová&#x27;s first husband was the dancer and ballet master Vlastimil Harapes, from 1986 until 1992. After they divorced, she married Slovak tenor Štefan Margita in 1992.

Zagorová suffered from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and in 2020, she experienced complications related to COVID-19.

<text>Christian Josef Danner (born 4 April 1958) is a former racing driver from Germany.

==Career==
===Formula Two and Formula 3000===
The son of car safety expert Max Danner, Danner started his motor racing career immediately after leaving school in 1977. After having raced in the Renault 5 cup Danner moved to the European Formula Two Championship for the season. During his years in Formula Two Danner was a constant frontrunner. He scored several podiums but failed to win a race. Danner also set the F2 lap record of the current configuration of the old Nürburgring.

After failing to finish a race in the first six races, Danner moved to Arrows with their powerful BMW turbo engines and scored his first point at the Austrian Grand Prix.

Danner returned to Zakspeed in . The car was both un-competitive and often unreliable and when Danner finished a race it was always outside the points. After having raced touring cars in 1988, Danner returned to Formula one in with Rial Racing. The car was highly uncompetitive and a fourth place due to a high attrition rate at the 1989 United States Grand Prix was the only highlight of the year.

After his Formula one career Danner became a regular competitor in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. He made his debut in 1988 after failing to find a ride in Formula one. Danner made an impressive start to his touring car career as he won both races at the Hockenheimring driving a BMW M3. After only making sporadic appearances in 1989 and 1990, Danner made a full-time return to the series in 1991. He had a disappointing season and only had one points scoring finish. In 1993 Danner had his best season. He scored six podium finishes and finished fifth in the points standings. He also won a race at the Non-Championship round in Donington Park. Danner returned to winning ways in 1995 when he won a race at the Norisring. Danner kept racing touring cars through 1997.

<doc id="1219726" wikidata="Q1016707" url="?curid=1219726" title="Blackburn, West Lothian">
<text>Blackburn is a town in West Lothian, Scotland, near both Bathgate and Livingston, two of the larger towns in the county. It is situated approximately west of Edinburgh and east of Glasgow on the old A8 road.

== History ==

Blackburn means &quot;the black stream&quot;, from the Old English &quot;blæc&quot; &quot;black&quot; and &quot;burna&quot; &quot;stream&quot;. The name was recorded as &quot;Blachebrine&quot; in 1152. As a small industrial centre, Blackburn originally developed as a cotton-manufacturing town. In the mid-19th century, it became a centre for coal mining.

Its small population expanded rapidly from 4,302 in 1961 to around 9,000 by 1965 as a result of employment opportunities in Bathgate to the north and through in-migration following the inception of the Glasgow Overspill Plan.

The closure of the British Leyland plant in 1986 brought decline to the area, along with the destruction of many homes built during the 1960s.

The railway station at Bathgate attracts commuters to live in Blackburn and provides easy access to both Glasgow and Edinburgh.

==Blackburn House==
Blackburn House is a category A-listed Georgian building, situated to the east of the town.

==Churches==

Blackburn and Seafield Parish Church (Church of Scotland) is located in Blackburn. The congregation celebrated its centenary in 2008. Blackburn Gospel Hall (Christian Brethren) meets for worship services and Bible studies in a well-kept church building originally constructed as Blackburn&#x27;s village school in the late 18th century. Our Lady of Lourdes, a Roman Catholic church located in Blackburn, also serves neighbouring communities and partners with a branch of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.

== Educational facilities ==

The village has the Roman Catholic secondary St. Kentigern&#x27;s Academy, which serves students from the surrounding areas of West Lothian.

Blackburn is also in the catchment area of the non-denominational secondary Bathgate Academy, which is away.

The village also houses three primary schools: Murrayfield Primary, Our Lady of Lourdes Primary and Blackburn Primary as well as Pinewood school, a combination primary/secondary Additional needs school.

Formerly the village had its own Blackburn Academy, a non-denominational secondary school that also served students from the surrounding areas of West Lothian. However, the academy was closed in 1992 after several new non-denominational high schools had opened in nearby Livingston.

==Climate==

==Sport==

===Football===
Blackburn is home to Scottish football club Blackburn United who play at the Purdie Worldwide Community Stadium (New Murrayfield Park) near the centre of the town and compete in the East of Scotland Football League Premier Division. The Club forms the pinnacle of the Blackburn United Community Sports Club.

===Taekwondo===
Blackburn was previously a big part of Scotia TaeKwonDo, when national competitions were regularly held in the Blackburn Community Centre which, before its demolition, was adjacent to New Murrayfield Park.

==Notable people==
*Susan Boyle, singer who first came to fame as a contestant on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and whose 2009 debut album &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; became the fastest selling UK debut album of all time.
*John Brown, footballer who attended Blackburn Academy and subsequently played for Rangers when the club won nine consecutive Scottish League titles.
*Angela Constance, Scottish National Party (SNP) politician and ex-Scottish Government Cabinet Minister.
*Steven Craig, footballer who, amongst others, played for Falkirk, Motherwell, Aberdeen and Dundee.
*Jim Devine, Labour politician who was convicted of fraud and jailed in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal
*Michael Gallagher, Australian paralympic gold medallist.
*Alexander Young (engineer), mechanical engineer born in the nineteenth century and who went onto become a politician in the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

==In British political culture==
The town was notably mentioned in a famous speech by MP Tam Dalyell in the House of Commons on 14 November 1977 in which he posed what would become known as the West Lothian question.

<text>John Keefer Mahony (30 June 1911 – 15 December 1990) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

Mahony was born in New Westminster, British Columbia and was 32 years old, and a major in The Westminster Regiment, Canadian Infantry Corps, during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 May 1944 at the River Melfa, Italy, Mahony and his company were ordered to establish the initial bridgehead over the river. This was accomplished in conjunction with the tanks of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians) and for five hours the company maintained its position in the face of enemy fire and attack until the remaining companies and supporting weapons were able to reinforce them. Early in the action Mahony was wounded in the head and twice in the leg, but he refused medical aid and continued to direct the defence of the bridgehead. The enemy saw that this officer was the soul of the defence and consequently made him their particular target.

Mahony was later promoted to lieutenant colonel, and retired from the army in 1962.

Mahony died on 15 December 1990 in London, Ontario.

Mount Mahony near Powell River, British Columbia, is named after him.

<text>Harvey Einbinder (June 18, 1926 – January 30, 2013) was an American physicist, author and amateur historian.

== Early life ==
Einbinder was born to Jacob B. Einbinder and Dora (née Abelson) in New Haven, Connecticut. He had one brother, David, and one sister, Hinde.

== Education ==
Einbinder studied for two years at the University of Connecticut (UConn), at first physics but then mathematics in which he received a degree with &quot;highest distinction&quot; in 1946. He later received his Ph.D. in physics from Columbia University.

== Career ==
He became a consultant to the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory and to General Electric on the Atlas missile. He published papers on hypersonic aerodynamics and the ionization of solid particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi=10.1063/1.1698931&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi=10.1063/1.1698800&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Einbinder patented a ten-finger typewriter keyboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;patent/US4332493A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Encyclopædia Britannica ==
Einbinder spent five years combing the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; for flaws, and found enough to fill a 390-page book, called &quot;The Myth of the Britannica&quot;, published by Grove Press in 1964. As summarized by &quot;The Age&quot; two years later, Einbinder&#x27;s book &quot;showed beyond argument that the Britannica was not a completely impartial and absolutely infallible work of general reference; that 666 articles in the 1963 edition were reprinted from editions dating back to 1875 in some cases; and that American influence on its editorial policy had become dominant&quot;. The Science Magazine commended Einbinder as a &quot;dedicated prince of iconoclasts&quot; who &quot;rips into his subject from all angles and with devastating effect&quot;. Furthermore, it was suggested that the editorial board of the Encyclopædia Britannica hire Einbinder as a fact-checker, although this never came to be. 

Einbinder at one point also disputed the historical accuracy of the Black Hole of Calcutta account. Among his other publications are &quot;An American Genius: Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;, and the play &quot;Mah Name is Lyndon&quot; (about US president Lyndon B. Johnson and the Vietnam War).

== Private life ==
Harvey Einbinder was married to Florence Einbinder, who predeceased him. He died on January 30, 2013, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City.
