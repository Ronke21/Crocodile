<text>Brigadier Lewis Pugh Evans, (3 January 1881 – 30 November 1962) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early years and family==
Lewis Pugh Evans was born at Abermad Llanfarian to Sir Gruffydd Humphrey Pugh Evans (1840–1902), Advocate-General of Bengal and a member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Council, and Lady Emilia Savi Pugh Evans (née Hills; 1849–1938). Lewis Pugh Evans was educated at Eton and entered the army after training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

Lewis Pugh Evans married Margaret Dorothea Seagrave Vaughan-Pryse-Rice on 10 October 1918. They lived at Lovesgrove on the death of his elder brother in 1945.

==Military career==
Following a year at Sandhurst, Evans entered the British Army with a commission in the Black Watch as second lieutenant on 23 December 1899, and served with the 2nd battalion in the Second Boer War in South Africa. He took part in operations in the Orange Free State February to May 1900, including the battles of Poplar Grove, Driefontein and Vet River; operations in the Transvaal May–June 1900, including the actions around Johannesburg, the occupation of Pretoria and the battle of Diamond Hill; and the battle of Battle of Belfast (August 1900). After the end of the conventional war he served with his battalion in the Orange River Colony during the Boer guerrilla warfare until peace was declared in June 1902. Following the end of the war in South Africa he left Point Natal for British India on the SS &quot;Ionian&quot; in October 1902 with other officers and men of his battalion, which after arrival in Bombay was stationed in Sialkot in Umballa in Punjab. After service with his regiment in India, Evans returned to England and obtained a pilot&#x27;s certificate.

===First World War===
When the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914 he was posted as an air observer with the Royal Flying Corps, and from May 1915 served as a brigade major, but after a few months he returned to the Black Watch and in 1917 was appointed to command the 1st Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment.

On 4 October 1917 near Zonnebeke, Belgium, Pugh was commanding his battalion when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

After recovering from his wounds he returned to duty with the 1st Battalion. On 9 April 1918 their lines came under attack in the Germans&#x27; Spring Offensive in a three-day battle. He was awarded for this a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order, the citation for which read:

At the end of hostilities in November 1918 he was commanding the 14th Infantry Brigade of the 32nd Division with temporary rank of Brigadier-General.

===Awards===
Evans was mentioned in despatches seven times and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Bar; the 1914 Star and Clasp; the British War Medal; the Victory Medal; the Order of Leopold (Belgium) and the Croix de Guerre. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1919, and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1938, and was also appointed an Officer of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem.

He also as a living recipient of the Victoria Cross received the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal (1935), King George VI Coronation Medal (1937), and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal (1953).

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Retirement==
In 1938 he retired from the army but returned to service in the Second World War as a Military Liaison Officer at the Headquarters of the Wales Region. He worked with the Special Operations Executive in India. He later achieved the rank of brigadier. Between October 1947 and January 1951 he was Honorary Colonel of the 16th Battalion, the Parachute Regiment.

Pugh Evans was Honorary Colonel of the Army Cadet Force in Ceredigion and was for 25 years President of the Aberystwyth Branch of the Royal British Legion.

He was a Churchwarden at Llanbadarn Fawr, where he now lies buried, and a Justice of the Peace on the local bench as well as Deputy Lieutenant for Cardiganshire and a Freeman of the borough of Aberystwyth. 

He died of a heart attack, aged eighty-one, at Paddington Station, London.

<text>Sergeant George Frederick Findlater VC (16 February 1872 – 4 March 1942) was a Scottish soldier in the British Army, who was awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain&#x27;s highest award for gallantry, for his role in the Tirah Campaign. On 20 October 1897, Findlater, then a junior piper in the Gordon Highlanders, was shot in the ankles during an advance against opposing defences at the Battle of the Dargai Heights; unable to walk, and exposed to enemy fire, he continued playing, to encourage the battalion&#x27;s advance. The event was widely covered in the press, making Findlater a public hero.

After receiving the Victoria Cross, Findlater supplemented his Army pension by performing at music halls, much to the outrage of the military establishment, but after growing scandal he retired to take up farming in Banffshire in 1899. In 1914, he re-enlisted in the Gordon Highlanders for the First World War; he served as the senior piper for the 9th Battalion until the end of 1915, when he returned home because of ill health. Active in a local pipe band, he continued to farm until his death in 1942, aged 70.

==Early life==

Findlater was born in 1872 at Turriff, Aberdeenshire, one of eleven children of Alexander Findlater, a miller, and his wife, Mary Ann Clark. He attended the school in Turriff but left at a young age to work as a farm labourer; under the law then in force, children were permitted to leave school at thirteen. Two months after his sixteenth birthday, on 7 April 1888, he travelled to Aberdeen and enlisted in the 2nd Battalion, Gordon Highlanders. The battalion was posted to Ceylon, where in 1891 he transferred to the 1st Battalion, then serving on the North-West Frontier of British India, now part of Pakistan. He first saw active combat there in March 1895, at the Malakand Pass, where he was hit but not wounded; later in the year, he served with the relief force in the Chitral Expedition.

In December 1896 he was appointed as a piper in the battalion&#x27;s band. The Gordons, in common with other Highland regiments of the time, maintained a pipe band in each battalion for both ceremonial and military purposes; the pipers were trained infantrymen, and accompanied the main force on operations. The following year, the 1st Battalion was assigned as part of the force for the Tirah campaign, an expedition into the mountains to secure the Khyber Pass and the northern approaches to India.

==Dargai Heights==

On 20 October 1897, an attempt by a British force to take the strongly held Dargai Heights was beaten back, leaving three battalions pinned down under heavy fire from above and unable to withdraw. They were reinforced by the 1st Gordons, who were ordered to advance through the open ground and storm the heights, led by their five pipers. Findlater was wounded before reaching the hillside, with a superficial wound to his left foot and a broken right ankle. Unable to walk, he pulled himself to a boulder, propped himself up, and continued to play to encourage the advance. The infantry following behind successfully reached the hillside, climbed the heights, and dispersed the defenders.
All observers agreed on the basics of the story, but the exact details of what happened were somewhat confused. The initial press reports describing the &quot;wounded piper&quot; took him to be Patrick Milne, the senior piper, and playing &quot;Cock o&#x27; the North&quot;, the regimental march. It was quickly discovered that Milne had been unable to play – he had been wounded in the chest – and that Findlater had been the man involved, playing &quot;The Haughs O&#x27; Cromdale&quot;. This was perhaps a more appropriate tune; not only was it a quicker and livelier strathspey, but the content fitted the situation. The Battle of Cromdale had famously – perhaps apocryphally – seen a wounded Jacobite piper perch on a rock and play his comrades into battle, and the traditional ballad itself described how &quot;the Gordons boldly did advance ... upon the Haughs o&#x27; Cromdale&quot;.

Findlater was evacuated to Rawalpindi where he was treated, and unable to continue in the Army as a result of his injuries, he was sent to Netley Hospital to convalesce. It was announced in May 1898 that he would receive the Victoria Cross, one of four men to be so honoured for actions at Dargai, and was personally decorated by Queen Victoria at Netley on 14 May, a few days before he was formally discharged from the Army.

==Public celebrity==

The Gordons&#x27; charge at Dargai had caught the imagination of the British public, and the romantic description of the wounded piper encouraging his comrades on was perhaps the most famous element of it. Whilst recovering, Findlater received a large number of public donations, including sets of bagpipes, and by at least one account, a proposal of marriage. The public interest increased sharply after he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and to supplement his Army pension Findlater arranged to appear at the Military Tournament, where he drew large crowds; for just thirty performances, he was paid two-thirds as much as his annual Army pension of £46. He then began to perform at music halls, first at the London Alhambra and then nationally, with his earnings climbing as high as £100 a week.

Whilst popular with the crowds, Findlater was seen by many of the military establishment as deliberately profiting from the Victoria Cross. The War Office approached the management of the Alhambra to try and stop his performance, without success, sparking counter-criticism as to whether the Army had any standing to control the private engagements of a man who had already left the Army. Within the year, however, his fame began to turn sour; he was implicated in a contentious breach of promise lawsuit in late 1898, which led to heckling at his Scottish performances, and to avoid further scandal left the country to tour the United States and Canada.

==Later life==

Following his return from North America, Findlater married his cousin Helen at Turriff in August 1899. A year later, he took up the tenancy of a farm at Forglen, where he and Helen settled to begin a family; they would have five children, two sons and three daughters.

At the start of the First World War, Findlater re-enlisted in the Army, returning to his old regiment. He was posted to the 9th Battalion of the Gordons, a New Army battalion in 15th (Scottish) Division, where he was appointed as the sergeant piper (or pipe major), the battalion&#x27;s senior piper. He served with the regiment through its first year in France, including the Battle of Loos, before being invalided home in December 1915. He continued to farm at Forglen, and was a member of the local pipe band at Turriff; from 1927 to 1940 he served as its pipe major. He died in early 1942, shortly after his seventieth birthday, of a heart attack.

==Legacy==
Whilst his moment of personal celebrity was fleeting, Findlater remained a popular figure in the public memory, continuing to be a subject of artwork and stories for some years. He was the focal point of Edward Hale&#x27;s painting &quot;Piper Findlater winning the VC&quot; (1897), Stanley Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Charge of the Gordon Highlanders&quot; (1897), Vereker Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Piper Findlater at Dargai&quot; (1898), Richard Caton Woodville&#x27;s &quot;The Storming of Dargai Heights&quot; (1898) and Robert Gibb&#x27;s &quot;Dargai&quot; (1909). Findlater&#x27;s playing at Dargai, along with the charge itself, became one of the more well-remembered moments of the Gordons&#x27; regimental history; they later applied for the Dargai Heights to be recognised as a battle honour, the only one of the nine participating regiments to do so, but were declined.

One of the &quot;Dand MacNeil&quot; stories in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s &quot;The General Danced at Dawn&quot; concerns an animated discussion in the Sergeants Mess concerning exactly what tune Piper Findlater did play at the Dargai Heights, Findlater himself not being positive what it had been.

<text>David Ferguson Hunter VC (28 November 1891 – 14 February 1965) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Hunter was 26 years old, and a corporal in the 1/5th Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC on 23 October 1918.

On 16/17 September 1918 at Moeuvres, France, Corporal Hunter was detailed to take on an advanced post which was established in shell holes close to the enemy. There was no opportunity for reconnoitring adjacent ground, and the following afternoon Corporal Hunter found that the enemy had established posts all round him, isolating his command. He determined to hold out and despite being exceedingly short of food and water this NCO managed to maintain his position for over 48 hours until a counter-attack relieved him. He repelled frequent enemy attacks and also barrage from our attacks, which came right across his post.

He was subsequently promoted to the rank of sergeant on 23 October 1918. He died 14 February 1965

On 12 August 2004, his previously unmarked grave in Dunfermline Cemetery was marked by a memorial stone in a ceremony.

<text>Corrado Fabi (born 12 April 1961) is a former racing driver from Italy. He participated in 18 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 13 March 1983, scoring no championship points. He is the younger brother of Teo Fabi, also a racing driver. 

==Career==
Corrado Fabi was born in Milan. He took up karting as a teenager, driving for the Birel Team. In 1979, age 18, he made his debut in Formula Three. In 1980 he partnered Michele Alboreto in the Euroracing European F3 team, finishing third in the championship.
In 1981 Fabi graduated to Formula Two and in 1982 he won the championship driving a March-BMW.

In 1983 Fabi made his debut in Formula One with Osella at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Despite the car&#x27;s lack of competitiveness, which marred his season, Fabi was able to show form, regularly outqualifying his team mate Piercarlo Ghinzani. In 1984 he shared a Brabham Formula One drive with his brother Teo, deputising for him when Teo&#x27;s commitments to CART racing in the USA took precedence. After his opportunities in Formula One dried up, Corrado Fabi raced briefly in CART before retiring to look after the family business.

<text>Francis George Miles (9 July 1896 – 8 November 1961) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 22 years old, and a Private in the 1/5th Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 October 1918 at Bois-l&#x27;Évêque, Landrecies, France, when his company was held up by a line of enemy machine guns in a sunken road, Private Miles, alone and on his own initiative went forward under exceptionally heavy fire, located a machine gun, shot the gunner and put the gun out of action. Then seeing another gun nearby, he again went forward alone, shot the gunner and captured the team of eight. Finally he stood up and beckoned to his company who, acting on his signals, were able to capture 16 machine guns, one officer and 50 other ranks.

He joined up again in World War II serving with the Pioneer Corps.

His medals are held in the Lord Ashcroft VC collection in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Vice-Admiral Sir William Nathan Wrighte Hewett, (12 August 1834 – 13 May 1888) was a Royal Navy officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The Hewett Treaty is named after him.

==Early life and Crimean War==
Hewett was born at Brighton on 12 August 1834 to William Hewett, physician to King William IV. William Hewett was the son of William Nathan Wright Hewett of Bilham Hall, near Doncaster, a once wealthy landowner who lost the majority of his fortune to horse-racing and had to leave the country for Calcutta. Hewett&#x27;s uncles included Sir Prescott Gardner Hewett, 1st Bt., John Short Hewett and Dr Cornwallis Hewett. He entered the Royal Navy in 1847, and served as a midshipman in the Second Anglo-Burmese War. In 1854, while acting mate of , he was attached to the Naval Brigade during the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War.

Hewett was in charge of the Right Lancaster Battery at Sevastopol on 26 October 1854. The battery was being threatened by the enemy and, through a misunderstanding, he was ordered to spike his gun and retreat. Disregarding the order, Hewett pulled down the parapet of the battery and with the assistance of some soldiers slewed his gun round and poured on the advancing enemy a most destructive and effectual fire. On 5 November, at the Battle of Inkerman, he again acted with great bravery. For these two actions, he was given the rank of acting lieutenant and later awarded the Victoria Cross, one of the first ever awarded. Hewett&#x27;s promotion was made official after passing his examinations at Portsmouth; He was subsequently appointed to the royal yacht, from which he was promoted to commander on 13 September 1858.

==Senior commands==
Hewett&#x27;s other commands included , and, following his promotion to captain on 24 November 1862, as flag-captain to Sir Henry Kellett. He was then captain of from 1872 to 1873. He was Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa, in charge of naval operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War, from 1873. For his services during this conflict, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 31 March 1874. He commanded from 1877 until he was drawn into service in the Mahdist War. In 1882 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. Following the British defeat at El Teb, Hewett commanded the naval brigade that landed at Suakin on 6 February 1884, and was appointed governor of Sudan on 10 February by Baker Pasha.

In April 1884, Hewett led a delegation to Emperor Yohannes IV which negotiated, in exchange for free transit of guns and ammunition through Massawa, access through Ethiopian territory for the successful evacuation of the Egyptian garrisons that had been isolated in southern Sudan by the revolt of Muhammad Ahmad (also known as the Mahdi) against the Egyptian rulers.
From May 1885 to July 1885 he was .
After his return from Ethiopia, Hewett was appointed Junior Naval Lord and, on 8 July 1884, was promoted to vice admiral. From March 1886 to April 1888 he was in command of the Channel Fleet; however, his delicate health worsened and he died shortly after his retirement.

Hewett&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London.

<doc id="1219747" wikidata="Q831584" url="?curid=1219747" title="Concrete mixer">
<text>A concrete mixer (also cement mixer) is a device that homogeneously combines cement, aggregate (e.g. sand or gravel), and water to form concrete. A typical concrete mixer uses a revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller volume works, portable concrete mixers are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand. This is usually done in a wheelbarrow; however, several companies have recently begun to sell modified tarps for this purpose. 

The concrete mixer was invented by Columbus, Ohio industrialist Gebhardt Jaeger.

==History==

One of the first concrete mixers ever was developed in 1900 by T.L. Smith in Milwaukee. The mixer already exhibited the still common basic construction with a tiltable conical drum (as double cone at that time) with blades. On February 9, 1904, the first portable concrete mixer was patented by Richard Bodlaender, an inventor from Breslau, Germany. This concrete mixer was horse-drawn and called &#x27;Mortar Mixer&#x27;. It worked by replacing the front wheels with a large drum that held large paddles for mixing the cement.1925, at least two mixers, built 25 years ago, were still in use (serial numbers 37 and 82). The &quot;Smith Mascot&quot; in essence has the same construction of the small mixers used today. In the 1920s, the &quot;T.L. Smith Company&quot; in Milwaukee built the world&#x27;s largest concrete mixers. Mixers of this company were used e. g. for the construction of the Wilson Dam (six 2-yard and two 4-yard mixers, at the time the largest single installation of the largest concrete mixers in the world), the first stadium of the Ohio State University and the Exchequer Dam. Roscoe Lee was granted a patent in 1934 for his transit concrete mixer design. This design made it possible for new trucks to be turned into concrete mixers by using a crane to put a drum on the back of the truck. It was less expensive than a cement truck dedicated to only carrying cement and allowed the trucks used to continue to be adapted for other things. Concrete mixers have continued to advance. Recently, research detailing a forward simulation model of an energy-saving concrete mixer using hydraulic technology was released based on Matlab/Simulink technology.

==Industrial mixers==

Today&#x27;s market increasingly requires consistent and short mixing times for the industrial production of ready-mix concrete, and more so for precast/prestressed concrete. This has resulted in refinement of mixing technologies for concrete production. Different styles of stationary mixers have been developed, each with its own inherent strengths targeting different parts of the concrete production market. The most common mixers used today fall into three categories:
*Twin-shaft mixers, known for their high intensity mixing, and short mixing times. These mixers are typically used for high strength concrete, RCC and SCC, typically in batches of .
*Vertical axis mixers, most commonly used for precast and prestressed concrete. This style of mixer cleans well between batches, and is favoured for coloured concrete, smaller batches (typically ), and multiple discharge points. Within this category, the pan mixers are losing popularity to the more efficient planetary (or counter-current) mixers, as the additional mixing action helps in production of more critical concrete mixes (colour consistency, SCC, etc.).
*Drum mixers (reversing drum mixer and tilting drum mixers), used where large volumes (batch sizes of ) are being produced. This type of mixer is capable of high production outputs.

All the mixer styles have their own inherent strengths and weaknesses, and all are used throughout the world to varying degrees of popularity.

==Trucks and trailers==

===Concrete mixing transport trucks===

Special concrete transport trucks (in-transit mixers) are made to mix concrete and transport it to the construction site. They can be charged with dry materials and water, with the mixing occurring during transport. They can also be loaded from a &quot;central mix&quot; plant; with this process the material has already been mixed prior to loading. The concrete mixing transport truck maintains the material&#x27;s liquid state through agitation, or turning of the drum, until delivery. These trucks have an interior turbine that pushes the mixed concrete up against gravity inside the drum. The interior of the drum on a concrete mixing truck is fitted with a spiral blade. In one rotational direction, the concrete is pushed deeper into the drum. This is the direction the drum is rotated while the concrete is being transported to the building site. This is known as &quot;charging&quot; the mixer. When the drum rotates in the other direction, the Archimedes&#x27; screw-type arrangement &quot;discharges&quot;, or forces the concrete out of the drum. From there it may go onto chutes to guide the viscous concrete directly to the job site. If the truck cannot get close enough to the site to use the chutes, the concrete may be discharged into a concrete pump, connected to a flexible hose, or onto a conveyor belt which can be extended some distance (typically ten or more metres). A pump provides the means to move the material to precise locations, multi-floor buildings, and other distance-prohibitive locations. Buckets suspended from cranes are also used to place the concrete.
The drum is traditionally made of steel but on some newer trucks, fibreglass has been used as a weight reduction measure. Most cement trucks weigh a substantial amount empty, meaning they have very heavy tare weights. United States weight laws under the Federal Bridge Formula (FBF) require a three-axle ready mixed concrete truck to weigh or under. This leaves only for concrete to be carried, as is the tare weight of the truck.

&quot;Rear discharge&quot; trucks require both a driver and a &quot;chuteman&quot; to guide the truck and chute back and forth to place concrete in the manner suitable to the contractor. Newer &quot;front discharge&quot; trucks have controls inside the cab of the truck to allow the driver to move the chute in all directions. The first front discharge mixer, patented in 1974, was designed and built by Royal W. Sims of Holladay, Utah, United States.

Concrete mixers are equipped with two or more axles. Four-, five- and six-axle trucks are the most common, with the number being determined by the load and local legislation governing allowable loads on the road.

The axles are necessary to distribute the load evenly, allow operation on weight restricted roads, and reduce wear and tear on normal roads. A two- or three-axle truck during the winter when road weight limits are reduced has no usable payload in many jurisdictions. Other areas may require expensive permits to operate.

Additional axles other than those used for steering (&quot;steers&quot;) or drivetrain (&quot;drives&quot;) may be installed between the steers and drives, or behind the drives. Mixers commonly have multiple steering axles as well, which generally result in very large turning radii. To facilitate maneuvering, the additional axles may be &quot;lift axles&quot;, which allows them to be raised off the ground so that they do not scrub (get dragged sideways across the ground) on tight turns, or increase the vehicle&#x27;s turning radius. Axles installed behind the drives are known as &quot;tag axles&quot; or &quot;booster axles&quot;, and are often equipped to turn opposite to the steering axle to reduce scrubbing and automatically lift when the truck is put into a reverse gear.

Tractor trailer combination mixers where the mixer is installed on a trailer instead of a truck chassis are used in some jurisdictions, such as the province of Quebec where even six-axle trucks would have trouble carrying a useful load.

Concrete mixers generally do not travel far from their plant, as the concrete begins to set as soon as it is in the truck. Many contractors require that the concrete be in place within 90 minutes after loading. Some trucks in dry climates are equipped with the capability of adding water in spray form during the trip, especially on long trips. If the truck breaks down or for some other reason the concrete hardens in the truck, workers may need to enter the barrel with jackhammers or the company has to scrap the entire drum.

Stephen Stepanian filed a patent application for the first truck mixer in 1916.

Trucks weigh , and can carry roughly of concrete although many varying sizes of mixer truck are currently in use. The most common truck capacity is .

Most concrete mixers in the UK are limited to a speed of .

===Concrete mixer trailers===

A variant of standard concrete transportation is the concrete (or, cement) mixing trailer. These small versions of transit-mix trucks are used to supply short loads of concrete. They have a concrete mixing drum with a capacity of between . Cart-aways are usually pulled behind a pick-up truck and batched from smaller batching systems. The mixing trailer system is popular with rental yards and building material locations, which use them to supply ready-mix to their regular customer base.

===Metered concrete trucks===
Metered concrete trucks or volumetric mobile mixers contain concrete ingredient materials and water to be mixed on the truck at the job site to make and deliver concrete according to the amount needed.

==On-site and portable concrete mixers==
For smaller jobs, such as residential repairs, renovations, or hobbyist-scale projects, many cubic yards of concrete are usually not required. Bagged cement is readily available in small-batch sizes, and aggregate and water are easily obtained in small quantities for the small work site. To service this small-batch concrete market, many types of small portable concrete mixers are available.

A typical portable concrete mixer uses a small revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller jobs the concrete made at the construction site has no time lost in transport, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens.

Portable concrete mixers may be powered by gasoline engines, although it is more common that they are powered by electric motors using standard mains current.

These concrete mixers are further divided based on their loading mechanism. Cement, sand and other aggregates are loaded in a hydraulically operated hopper and then poured into the mixing drum for final mixing. They can be unloaded by tilting the drum. In hand-feed concrete mixers, cement, sand and other aggregates are directly added to the mixing drum manually. Both of these types of concrete mixers are popular in construction activities in Africa, some Middle Eastern countries and in the Indian subcontinent.

==Self-loading concrete mixers==

Self-loading concrete mixers are unique machines designed to batch, mix and transport concrete. They consist of a rotating drum mounted on an operator-driven cab-mounted chassis frame fitted with a loading bucket.

The operator of the self-loading concrete mixers batches and introduces the ingredients required for mixing concrete (cement, stone aggregates etc.) into the drum using the loading bucket. The drum is usually reversible type, tilt type or a combination of both. A predetermined volume of water is discharged to the drum via a water dispensing unit. The mixture is rotated at mixing speeds within the drum until the concrete discharges via a fitted chute.

Self-loading concrete mixers are suited for construction sites where concrete batching plants are unavailable, underfoot conditions are not suited for concrete transit mixer trucks or labor availability is scarce or constrained. Applications include urban and rural construction, concrete pavement maintenance, bridge and tunnel construction, township-level highways construction, foundation construction, national defense facilities, construction of high-speed railways, etc.

== Operating code ==
Operating concrete mixers correctly is one of the biggest safety issues in construction zones. Workers whose tasks are related to concrete processing currently number more than 250,000. Over 10 percent of those workers, 28,000, experienced a job-related injury or illness, and 42 died in just one year.

<text>Major General Arthur Thomas Moore, (20 September 1830 – 25 April 1913) was a Bombay Army officer and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Moore was born in Carlingford, County Louth and educated at the East India Company College. He was 26 years old, and a lieutenant in the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry, Indian Army during the Persian War when the following deed took place for which he and John Grant Malcolmson were awarded the VC.

On 8 February 1857 at the Battle of Khushab, Persia, Lieutenant Moore who was Adjutant of the Regiment, was probably the first in the attack, but his horse, on leaping into the square, fell dead, crushing his rider and breaking his sword. Lieutenant Moore extricated himself, but he would almost certainly have lost his life had not Lieutenant John Grant Malcolmson fought his way to his dismounted comrade and carried him to safety. In this battle Lieutenant Moore also charged an infantry square of 500 Persians at the head of his regiment and jumped his horse over the enemy&#x27;s bayonets.

He later achieved the rank of major general. He died 8 Waterloo Place, Dublin, 25 April 1913 and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.

<text>Lieutenant George Arthur Knowland VC (16 August 1922 – 31 January 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross during the Second World War, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Knowland was born on 16 August 1922 in Catford, Kent and attended Elmwood Primary School in Croydon. He joined the Royal Norfolk Regiment of the British Army, in 1940, as a private. He later joined No.3 Commando serving with them in Sicily and Italy, before being commissioned in 1944.

At 22 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Norfolks but now attached to No. 1 Commando in Burma, he took part in the Battle of Hill 170 where he was to earn the VC.

On 31 January 1945 near Kangaw, Burma, Lieutenant Knowland was in command of a forward platoon of a troop which was being heavily attacked – some 300 of the enemy concentrating on his 24 men. During the attacks he moved among the men distributing ammunition and contributing with rifle fire and throwing grenades at the enemy. When the crew of one of his forward Bren light machine guns had been wounded, he rushed forward to man it himself. The enemy was only away but below the level of the trench so to fire into them he stood up. He continued to fire until the casualties had been evacuated. A replacement gun team that had been sent for were injured while moving up and he stayed with the gun until a third team arrived.

In a subsequent attack he took over a 2 inch (51 mm) mortar which he fired from the hip directly into the enemy. He returned to the trench for more ammunition and fired the mortar from out in the open. When this was used up he fired his rifle. The enemy were then very close and without time to reload his rifle, he picked up a &quot;Tommy gun&quot; (sub machine gun) and used it. He killed more of the enemy but received mortal wounds. Despite over 50% losses in the platoon the remainder held on. By the time they were relieved the men had held the ground for 12 hours; they prevented the enemy from advancing further on that hill.

His grave is in the Taukkyan War Cemetery, Burma.

<text>Derek Patrick Daly (born 11 March 1953) is an Irish former racing driver, businessman and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to .

Born and raised in Dublin, Daly won the British Formula Three Championship in 1977, before participating in 64 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting at the 1978 United States Grand Prix West. His 15 championship points made him the first Irish driver to score in Formula One, and remains the highest scoring; he also participated in several non-championship races. After Formula One, Daly moved to the United States to compete in CART and IMSA, where he led Nissan to the IMSA GTP Championship in 1990.

==Racing career==
After honing his skills in the Irish Formula Ford Championship, Daly had his first drive in the European Formula Two Championship in 1977. In 1978 and 1979, he competed in both Formula Two and Formula One, finishing third in the Formula Two championship in both seasons. From 1980 to 1982, he focussed on Formula One, his best year being 1980, when he scored two fourth-place finishes and finished 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. His two most memorable moments in F1 both came in the Monaco Grand Prix. In 1980 he crashed spectacularly at the first corner after vaulting three other cars. In 1982 he suddenly found himself in contention for the win when the four cars ahead of him ran into problems with under two laps to go, but ended up on the sidelines himself when his gearbox seized moments later.
In 1982, Daly began driving in the CART series and continued through 1989. He started 66 CART races, including each Indianapolis 500 from 1983 to 1989, except for 1986. He finished in the top ten a total of 21 times, including one podium finish, 3rd position, at Milwaukee in 1987. In September 1984 he was nearly killed in a crash in the CART PPG Detroit News Grand Prix 200 at Michigan International Speedway. The front end of his car was sheared off and he suffered multiple injuries including a crushed left ankle, double compound fracture to the left tibia and fibula, fractured left hip socket, severely fractured pelvis, several broken left side ribs, broken left hand, 3rd degree burns to the left arm, dislocated right foot and ankle, deep abrasions and soft tissue to right heel, and internal bleeding.

Daly won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1990 and 1991 driving a Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo. In 1990, he had the unusual distinction of driving both the first and second-placed cars.

==Broadcast and business career==
Daly is known in motor sports circles around the world as a driver, writer, broadcaster, racing advisor, and businessman. He runs a professional services company called MotorVation, and had been a commentator for American broadcasts of the Champ Car series, as well as a public speaker. One of the agencies that represents him is the National Speakers Bureau.

In 2018, Daly was fired from a racing analyst position he had at WISH-TV when WISH-TV attributed a racial slur that was uttered by Indianapolis Colts announcer Bob Lamey in 1983 to him. While not disputing saying the slur, Daly contends that he did not use the offending language in the context Lamey alleged (Lamey claimed that Daly had once stated &quot;... there aren&#x27;t any (racial slur) in this race&quot;), but instead used the word as part of a common Irish colloquialism during a 1983 radio interview. Daly filed a $25M lawsuit as a result. Later that year, U.S. district court judge Richard L. Young ruled in favor of WISH-TV and the station&#x27;s former parent company, Nexstar Media Group, in all claims in Daly&#x27;s lawsuit and ordered him to pay Nexstar&#x27;s legal costs.

==Personal life==
Daly became a US citizen on September 28, 1993, and he now resides in Carmel, Indiana. He has three sons, Conor, Colin and Christian.

Daly&#x27;s son Conor is also a racing driver. He made his debut in full-time open-wheel racing in 2012, driving for the Lotus GP team in GP3, before moving GP2 in 2014 driving for Venezuela GP Lazarus. Conor made his IndyCar Series debut in 2013 and was a full-time driver from 2016 to 2023. He also competed in the Daytona 500 in 2023, finishing 29th.

Daly&#x27;s niece, Nicola Daly, is an Ireland women&#x27;s field hockey international and was a member of the squad that won the silver medal at the 2018 Women&#x27;s Hockey World Cup. She also works as a data engineer for Juncos Racing.

<text>Brigadier General George William St George Grogan, (1 September 1875 – 3 January 1962) was a career officer in the British Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Grogan was commissioned into the West India Regiment in September 1896, later serving in Sierra Leone in the Hut Tax War of 1898. Promoted to captain on 5 November 1900, he was seconded for service with the Egyptian Army in May 1902, and stayed there for five years. In 1907 he joined the Yorkshire Light Infantry, moving to the Worcestershire Regiment in 1908.

Promoted to major on 28 September 1914, Grogan joined the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Division, of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Wounded in January 1915, after the Battle of Neuve Chapelle he took command of the 1st Battalion as temporary lieutenant colonel. On 1 January 1916 he was created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) and was mentioned in despatches. After fighting in the Battle of the Somme in 1916, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in March 1917 and that month promoted to temporary brigadier general and was appointed to command the 23rd Brigade, 8th Division, from April 1917 as temporary brigadier general. The citation for his DSO read:
In the retreat during Operation Michael in March 1918, Grogan&#x27;s efforts resulted in the award of a Bar to his DSO. The citation for the award read:
During the Third Battle of the Aisne, Grogan won the VC for inspiring the defence of a hill above the River Vesle at Jonchery during 27–29 May 1918. The citation for the award read:
In 1919 Grogan was sent with the 1st Brigade of the &quot;Relief Force Russia&quot; under Lord Rawlinson to evacuate the North Russia intervention forces. On 3 June 1919 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In October 1923 he reached the substantive rank of colonel, commanding the 5th Infantry Brigade in the 2nd Division. He relinquished this assignment, and his temporary rank of colonel commandant, in April 1925. He was then placed on the half-pay list.

Grogan served as an aide-de-camp (equerry) to King George V from 1920 to 1926, and retired as an honorary brigadier general in 1926. In 1933–45 he was appointed one of His Majesty&#x27;s Bodyguard of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms. He was honorary colonel of the Worcestershire Regiment from 1938 to 1945.

==Family==
Grogan was the son of Colonel Edward George Grogan CB CBE, who commanded the 1st Battalion Black Watch in the Second Boer War, and his wife Meta, only daughter of Admiral Sir Sir William King-Hall. His paternal grandfather was Captain George Grogan of Sutton, County Dublin, a captain in the 6th Dragoon Guards.

On 22 January 1920 Grogan married Ethel G Elger, eldest daughter of John Elger the Younger, at Holy Trinity Church, Chelsea, London. They had two sons: Gwyn, born 7 August 1921, and Edward, born 27 June 1924.

<text>James McKechnie VC (30 June 1826 – 5 July 1886) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was born to Colin McKechnie and Jane McKechnie (Nee McGregor) and was married to an Elizabeth McLean.

McKechnie was 28 years old, and a sergeant in the Scots Fusilier Guards, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 September 1854 at the Battle of the Alma, Crimea, when the shot and fire from the batteries just in front of the battalion threw it into momentary disorder, it was forced out of its formation, becoming something of a huge triangle, with one corner pointing towards the enemy. A captain was carrying the Queen&#x27;s Colour which had the pole smashed and 20 bullet holes through the silk. Sergeant McKechnie held up his revolver and dashed forward, rallying the men round the Colours. He was wounded in the action.

McKechnie was personally presented with the Victoria Cross by Queen Victoria at the first VC investiture held at Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857.

In 2015, Kier Homes named a street in their Hawkhead Village development in Paisley, James McKechnie Avenue, in memory of him.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Scots Guards RHQ) in Wellington Barracks, Chelsea, London.

<doc id="1219767" wikidata="Q171432" url="?curid=1219767" title="Didier Pironi">
<text>Didier Joseph Louis Pironi (26 March 1952 – 23 August 1987) was a French racing driver and offshore powerboat racer, who competed in Formula One from to . Pironi was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won three Grands Prix across five seasons. In endurance racing, Pironi won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Renault.

Born and raised in Val-de-Marne, Pironi was the half-brother of racing driver José Dolhem. After initially studying engineering, he enrolled at the Winfield Racing School at Paul Ricard, earning a scholarship to compete in Formula Renault, where he won the Eurocup in 1974 and 1976. After finishing third in the 1977 European Formula Two Championship, Pironi progressed to Formula One in with Tyrrell, making his debut at the . Pironi retained his seat at Tyrrell the following season, achieving his maiden podium at the . He moved to Ligier in to partner Jacques Laffite, taking his maiden win in Belgium—amongst several podiums—as he finished fifth in the standings. 

His performances at Ligier attracted the attention of Enzo Ferrari, who signed him to Ferrari in as the teammate of Gilles Villeneuve. Whilst leading the 1982 World Drivers&#x27; Championship, having controversially won the amid the FISA–FOCA war, Pironi was seriously injured during qualifying for the ; he crashed his Ferrari 126C2 in very wet conditions, leaving him paralysed from the waist down. The accident came three months after the death of Villeneuve, whose fatal crash was attributed to his rivalry with Pironi. He ultimately lost the title by five points to Keke Rosberg. He retired from racing with three wins, four pole positions, five fastest laps and 13 podiums in Formula One.

Outside of Formula One, Pironi entered four editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to , winning in alongside Jean-Pierre Jaussaud, driving the Renault Alpine A442B. He was also a race-winner in the BMW M1 Procar Championship. In August 1987, Pironi died in an offshore powerboat racing accident near the Isle of Wight.

==Early life==
Pironi was born in Villecresnes, Val-de-Marne. He is the half-brother and first cousin of José Dolhem (they had the same father and their mothers were sisters). He began studying as an engineer and earned a degree in science, but entering the family construction business fell by the wayside following his enrollment at the Winfield Racing School at Paul Ricard, graduating with a prestigious Volant Shell Competition Scholarship (free one Formula France season entry) as the best student of 1972.

==Professional driving career (1972–1982)==

The program was designed to promote young motorsport talents, that also led Alain Prost, René Arnoux and Patrick Tambay into Formula One. He became Formula France champion in 1974, taking the Super Renault championship title in 1976 and winning the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race in 1977. 

===Tyrrell and Ligier===
Pironi signed with Tyrrell and made his F1 debut at the Argentine GP on 15 January 1978. Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s team which, despite being British, had a strong working relationship with Elf, dating back to the late 1960s. 

In the same year, Pironi was part of the massive Renault squad tasked with winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Partnering Jean-Pierre Jaussaud in the team&#x27;s second car, the unusual &quot;bubble roof&quot; A442B, he won the race by four laps from the rival Porsche 936s.





Two seasons with the underfinanced Tyrrell team demonstrated enough promise for Guy Ligier to sign Pironi to his eponymous French team in 1980, a season in which Pironi recorded his first victory, in the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder, as well as several podium finishes. The Ligier JS11/15 was an excellent car but was unable to reach its maximum potential. A combination of the team&#x27;s incompetence and Jacques Laffite being in firm political control meant that Pironi was not going to win the championship with Ligier. 

===Ferrari===
Pironi&#x27;s performance piqued Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s interest in the Frenchman&#x27;s services, which he secured for 1981. Ferrari later recalled, &quot;As soon as Pironi arrived at Maranello, he won everyone&#x27;s admiration and affection, not only for his gifts as an athlete, but also for his way of doing things - he was reserved while at the same time outgoing.&quot;

Teamed and compared with Ferrari&#x27;s lead driver Gilles Villeneuve, who welcomed the Frenchman and treated him as an equal, Pironi was slower in qualifying but steadier in races during his first season with Ferrari.

====1982 San Marino Grand Prix====
Establishing a fine rapport with the senior members of the team, Pironi arguably exploited this good relationship in the aftermath of the controversial 1982 San Marino Grand Prix, where Pironi is widely thought to have duped Villeneuve into conceding victory by giving the impression that he would finish behind his teammate, only to unexpectedly power past him into the Tosa hairpin, despite the team having signaled both drivers to slow down. Villeneuve was furious with Pironi and vowed never to say another word to him. The Canadian was killed in qualifying two weeks later at the following Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder trying to beat Pironi&#x27;s lap time. Many believe that this was foremost on Villeneuve&#x27;s mind at the time of his fatal accident.

Harvey Postlethwaite (the co-designer of the 126C2) believed that the &quot;drama&quot; following San Marino was blown out of proportion by the press, &quot;Villeneuve was really upset because he felt he should have been handed the race on a plate... They were competitive and either of them could win.&quot;

He also mentioned a technical reason as to why the two Ferraris were swapping places so often during the San Marino race. &quot;The (Ferrari 126C) turbo pressure was very, very difficult to control. Most of the reason that they were able to pass one another so evenly was that one would go through a sticky patch and sort of only be giving 4-bar of boost or 4.2, and the other would be getting a burst of 4.5, so it would have the legs of the other guy. It wasn&#x27;t quite as spectacular as it appeared at the time.&quot;

According to Ferrari&#x27;s chief mechanic Paolo Scaramelli, the team had agreed before the race that if the two Renaults were out, the drivers should have maintained position. Pironi did say a deal took place but the terms were more complex, &quot;We had a meeting before the race; Arnoux, Prost, Gilles and me, in my motorhome. We agreed to make a spectacle for the first half of the race so long as our positions on the lap after half-distance were the same as on the grid. We started the real race at half-distance and so had plenty of fuel. The team (Ferrari) didn&#x27;t know that, Marco Piccinini and Gérard Larrousse (Renault F1&#x27;s team manager) didn&#x27;t know, only the mechanics knew, but Prost and Arnoux - they will tell you the same.&quot; Pironi went on to add, &quot;When I passed Villeneuve the first time, this was because he had made a mistake and had gone off the circuit. The first slow sign we got was a few laps after that, and by then we knew we had a lot of fuel left because of the way we drove the first half of the race.&quot;

In a 2002 interview with &quot;Motor Sport&quot;, Marco Piccinini supported Pironi&#x27;s view, &quot;It was a genuine misunderstanding triggered by Gilles making a mistake. He went off the circuit slightly and Didier passed. The sign was hung out because we were 1-2, not because we favored one driver over the other. We didn&#x27;t favor either because it was at an early stage of the championship. We just wanted to maintain 1-2.&quot;

In 2007, former Marlboro marketing executive John Hogan (whose company sponsored Pironi in his time as a Ferrari driver) disputed the claim that Pironi had gone back on a prior arrangement with Villeneuve. He said: &quot;I think Gilles was stunned somebody had out-driven him and that it just caught him so much by surprise.&quot;

With a fast, reliable car, Pironi appeared to be on course for being 1982 World Champion, but the Frenchman&#x27;s own state of mind underwent severe stress due to several factors. Widespread antipathy by many in the F1 fraternity was directed toward him in the wake of the Zolder tragedy. There was also the rapid breakdown of his marriage to longtime girlfriend Catherine Beynie within weeks of the ceremony taking place. He observed first hand the death of Riccardo Paletti in the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix, the young Italian rookie ploughing into Pironi&#x27;s stalled Ferrari on the starting grid.

Ferrari team members are reported to have observed changes in Pironi&#x27;s behaviour throughout that summer following Villeneuve&#x27;s death. Shortly before the 1982 British Grand Prix, Pironi remarked &quot;I feel I am beginning to touch the World Championship.&quot;


====1982 German Grand Prix====
After claiming pole position for the German Grand Prix, Pironi was also busy testing a new-composition Goodyear rain tyre (under the guidance of Mauro Forghieri) in untimed practice. The &quot;new-spec&quot; Goodyear rain tyres proved to be very successful, with Pironi lapping up to 2.5 seconds faster than newly recruited teammate Patrick Tambay driving the sister Ferrari. (Pironi: 2 min 10.9 sec, Tambay: 2 min 13.4 sec)

Racing journalists at the circuit were quick to say Pironi was driving &quot;like a madman.&quot; In defense of Pironi, Forghieri said that the substantial differences in the lap times between the two sets of Goodyears were no surprise to the team. The weather conditions at Hockenheim that weekend were highly uncertain; quickly alternating back and forth between wet and dry.

In the rain, one of the many problems caused by &quot;ground effect&quot; F1 cars was that the spray was forced out from under the side pods as a fine mist and virtually created a fog. To those behind, this made cars in front close to invisible.

When Pironi tried passing Derek Daly&#x27;s Williams, the Ferrari 126C2 smashed into the back of Alain Prost&#x27;s invisible Renault: a violent accident which bore some similarity to that suffered by Villeneuve. Pironi survived, but multiple fractures to both of his legs meant he never raced again in Formula 1. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, he said he felt no pain. &quot;It was just like my accidents before, when I had no injuries. All I could think about was the car, that the spare one didn&#x27;t work as well as this one, and that I would have to use it (the spare) for the race. Then I saw my legs and I thought maybe I wouldn&#x27;t be doing this race, after all. In the helicopter, they began to hurt very seriously. But if I was to have this accident, it was lucky for me that it was in Germany and not in a more primitive place.&quot; The extent of Pironi&#x27;s leg fractures was severe; however, contrary to Pironi&#x27;s account of the accident, medics under the guidance of Professor Sid Watkins did not consider amputation in order to extricate him from the car.

At this point, he was leading with 39 points in the championship, ahead of Watson (30) and Keke Rosberg (27), but Pironi was relegated to runner-up as Rosberg passed him to become World Champion. Despite missing four races of that year&#x27;s fourteen, Pironi lost the title to Rosberg by just 5 points.

In his Formula One career Didier Pironi won three races, achieved 13 podiums, and scored a total of 101 championship points. He also secured four pole positions.

==Death==
In 1986, after he was able to walk with both legs unaided, it looked as if Pironi would make a comeback when he tested for the French AGS team at Circuit Paul Ricard, and subsequently the Ligier JS27 at Dijon-Prenois. He proved that he was still fast enough to be competitive, but coming back to F1 was not truly practical due to the extent of his injuries. A return to F1 was further complicated by his insurance payout being based on the premise of sustaining career-ending injuries; Pironi would be required to pay the money back to his insurer should he return to the sport. It is believed that Pironi had reached an agreement with his insurance company to return to Formula 1 in 1988 and had signed a pre-contract with the Larrousse &amp; Calmels team. 

When it appeared that it would be impossible to return to Formula 1, Pironi decided to turn to offshore powerboat racing instead. On 23 August 1987, Pironi was killed in an accident in the Needles Trophy Race near the Isle of Wight, that also took the life of his two crew members: journalist Bernard Giroux and his old friend Jean-Claude Guénard. Their boat, &quot;Colibri 4&quot;, rode over a rough wave caused by an oil tanker, causing the boat to flip over.

After Pironi&#x27;s death, his girlfriend Catherine Goux gave birth to twins. In honour of Pironi and Gilles Villeneuve, she named them Didier and Gilles. In 2014 Gilles Pironi joined Mercedes AMG Petronas as an engineer.
Gilles stood on the podium at the 2020 British Grand Prix, receiving the constructor&#x27;s trophy.

<doc id="1219770" wikidata="Q332183" url="?curid=1219770" title="Art Paul">
<text>Arthur Paul (January 18, 1925 – April 28, 2018) was an American graphic designer and the founding art director of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. During his time at &quot;Playboy&quot;, he commissioned illustrators and artists, including Andy Warhol, Salvador Dalí, and James Rosenquist, as part of the illustration liberation movement.

In addition to being an art director and graphic designer — in particular of &quot;Playboy&quot;″s rabbit logo — Art Paul was an illustrator, fine artist, curator, writer, and composer. There has been a surge of recent interest concerning both Art&#x27;s past and present, with recent talks, books, exhibitions, and a documentary being made about him. At 91 years old, he put his drawings and writings into book form, creating projects focused on race, aging, animals, and graphic whimsy.

==Early life and education==
Paul was born on January 18, 1925, in the Southwest Side of Chicago. His family later moved to Rogers Park area on the north side. There, while attending Roger C. Sullivan High School, an art teacher recognized that he was talented enough to earn a scholarship at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, which he attended from 1940 to 1943. After World War II service in the Army Air Corps, he attended the Institute of Design, known as the &quot;Chicago Bauhaus&quot; and now part of Illinois Institute of Technology, where he studied with László Moholy-Nagy.

&quot;For Paul — student at the Institute of Design, commonly called the Chicago Bauhaus — &quot;Playboy&quot; was a laboratory for producing a model of contemporary magazine design and illustration ... Paul helped create a forum that demolished artistic and cultural boundaries. In doing so, he transformed magazine illustration.&quot; — Steven Heller, an American design critic.

==&quot;Playboy&quot; magazine==
Paul was working as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator in a small office on Van Buren Street next to the Chicago &quot;L&quot; tracks when in 1953 he was contacted by Hugh Hefner. Hefner needed an art director for a magazine he was developing, and learned of Paul through a mutual acquaintance. At the time, Hefner planned to call the magazine &quot;Stag Party.&quot; The initial dummy, designed by cartoonist Arv Miller, resembled movie star/screen magazines of the time. Hefner wanted a different, more innovative and sophisticated look. Together, Paul and Hefner created the first issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, with Paul creating the look of the magazine.

&quot;I at first hesitated to accept offer. For as a freelancer I had the best clients one could in Chicago. So I freelanced the first few issues. What convinced me to accept was that I was promised freedom to buy the kind of art most illustrators couldn&#x27;t sell in 1953, the personal visions that lay closest to their hearts. I told illustrators I don&#x27;t want &#x27;commercial&#x27; art. I want the kind you do to please yourself when you&#x27;re not trying to get work in a magazine. At first they thought I was kidding. As for fine artists, I convinced them they would not be selling out to work for us but would reach a larger audience with their most authentic work.&quot;—Art Paul.

The name of the magazine was changed to &quot;Playboy&quot; shortly before the first issue went to print, after Hefner was threatened with a trademark dispute over the &quot;Stag Party&quot; name. The cartoon mascot designed by Miller, originally intended to be a stag, was quickly changed to a rabbit by replacing the head, although the stag&#x27;s hoofs remained visible in the altered drawings. The magazine&#x27;s famous rabbit-head logo with cocked ear and tuxedo bow tie was developed by Paul for &quot;Playboy&quot;″s second issue. Initially intended as an endpoint for articles, Paul sketched the logo in about an hour. Soon, however, the decision was made to use the logo as the symbol of &quot;Playboy&quot;″s corporate identity.

As Art Director, Paul supervised the design of the magazine for 30 years. Early on, he commissioned many local Chicago artists and photographers to illustrate the magazine. These included Franz Altschuler, Leon Bellin who illustrated &quot;Playboy&quot;″s continuing &#x27;Ribald Classic&#x27; feature, Roy Schnakenberg, Ed Paschke, Seymour Rosofsky, printmaker Mish Kohn and photographer Arthur Siegel.

During Paul&#x27;s years at &quot;Playboy&quot;, the magazine won hundreds of awards for excellence in graphic design and illustration. Paul has been credited for helping create a revolution in illustration (what Print Magazine called the &quot;Illustration Liberation Movement&quot;) by insisting that graphic design and illustration need not be &quot;low&quot; arts but could, when approached with integrity and emotional depth, and in a spirit of experimentation, be as &quot;high&quot; an art as any.

&quot;Commercial artists usually look out for what the client is already doing or saying. I wasn&#x27;t looking for that. I wanted the artists to express themselves... I wanted the painters and illustrators to give me what they did for themselves on Sunday. I didn&#x27;t want them to pick out the line from the story they felt was the sexiest. I wanted their personal, authentic work.&quot;— Art Paul, 2015 AIGA interview

==Career after &quot;Playboy&quot;==
After leaving &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1982, Paul did graphic design, posters, and logos for a number of clients in magazines, advertising, television and film. For the last ten years he concentrated primarily on drawing and painting, exhibiting most recently at the Chicago Cultural Center and at Columbia College in Chicago. He served on boards of the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, the Association of Art Curators in Chicago, and the Illinois Summer School of the Arts. , he was working on two books of his drawings. Paul resided in Chicago. Paul was the subject of a talk at the Chicago Humanities Festival on November 1, 2014, given by graphic designer James Goggin, at which Paul and his wife Suzanne Seed were present.

== Legacy ==
A new exhibition at the Noyes Cultural Arts Center in Evanston, IL, titled &quot;Overheard Conversations with Myself: The Talking Sketchbooks of Art Paul&quot; will be shown March 22–May 22, 2020. Paul&#x27;s wife, Suzanne, says of the exhibition, &quot;Art&#x27;s &quot;Talking Sketchbook&quot; has images whose accompanying words seemed to be the thoughts of the drawing itself, or words each drawing gave birth to just by breaking its bounds into quirky philosophies, squirrely meditations, and outrageously original mottos. these drawings are a glimpse into a mind that never paused in its playful and boundless creativity.&quot;

The Chicago-based gallery One After 909 exhibited Paul&#x27;s &quot;Race Face&quot; collection from October 26–December 8, 2018.

Additionally, there are two books, &quot;Race Face&quot; and &quot;Talking Sketchbook&quot;, that are in the works. On his inspiration behind &quot;Race Face&quot;, Art Paul said, &quot;Many of my drawings of heads aim to reveal how we are haunted by the projections other mask us with and use to deride us, how our self-images are altered by violence, paranoia, shame, and dread. So often we feel compelled to hide our authentic selves behind masks.&quot;

There is also an autobiography in progress with the working title &quot;Graphic Graphics: Art Paul&#x27;s Advice to Young Designers Facing Difficult Clients, Art-Blind Editors, Exploding Technologies, Budget Trolls, and Sexual Revolutions&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1980, Paul was elected a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale. The Institute of Design, IIT, honored him with its professional achievement award in 1983, and in 1986 he was elected to the Hall of Fame of the Art Directors Club. He received the Herb Lubalin Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Publication Designers, and in 2008 was made a Fellow of the Chicago Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Artists. The Society of Typographic Arts gave him a special award for outstanding achievement in trademark design for the &quot;Playboy&quot; rabbit head symbol. The Art Directors Club of Boston gave him an award for &quot;inspiring, encouraging, and creating an outstanding showcase for contemporary artists&quot;. The Art Directors of Philadelphia awarded him the Polycube Award for &quot;consistent excellence in communications&quot;. The City of Milan, Italy, awarded him its Gold Medal for the exhibition, &quot;Beyond Illustration&quot;. Art Direction Magazine gave Paul the first award in its publishing history for &quot;interest and support of illustration and illustrators and the tremendous range of illustrative styles that run in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

===International exhibitions===
Paul organized many years of &quot;Playboy&quot; illustrations and special projects he had directed into the exhibition &quot;Beyond Illustration: The Art of Playboy&quot;, which toured museums in North America, Europe and Japan between 1971 and 1974. An updated version of the exhibition, &quot;The Art of Playboy: From the First 25 Years&quot;, opened at Chicago&#x27;s Cultural Center in 1978, and toured North and South American museums and universities. The exhibitions included artists such as Andy Warhol, Larry Rivers, Salvador Dalí, LeRoy Neiman, James Rosenquist, and Tom Wesselmann. The Hyde Park Art Center hosted the 2004 exhibit &quot;I Read It for the Art: Chicago, Creativity, and Playboy&quot;, featuring Paul&#x27;s works, along with the works of many of the Chicago artists he helped to establish.

<doc id="1219773" wikidata="Q173254" url="?curid=1219773" title="Eliseo Salazar">
<text>Eliseo Salazar Valenzuela (; born 14 November 1954) is a Chilean former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Salazar remains the only Chilean driver to compete in Formula One.

Salazar made his Formula One debut at the 1981 United States Grand Prix West, scoring a total of three championship points across 37 Grands Prix. After Formula One, Salazar participated in several motorsport disciplines, becoming the Chilean national rally champion in 1984 and 1985. Across a three-decade career, Salazar also competed in American open-wheel racing and sportscar racing.

==Career==

===Formula One (1981–1983)===

After racing in the British F1 Championship in 1980 with a Williams FW07, and winning in Silverstone, he moved to Formula One in 1981, with March. He switched midseason to Ensign, and finished 6th in the Dutch Grand Prix. In 1982 he drove for ATS, and finished 5th in the San Marino Grand Prix, a race where only 7 teams entered due to the FISA–FOCA war. His most noted career moment in Formula One came when he collided with the overtaking race leader Nelson Piquet in the 1982 German Grand Prix; after both drivers got out of their stricken cars, the angry Piquet started to punch and kick Salazar. In 1983 he entered six races with RAM Racing, but the car was very slow and he only managed to qualify twice. He finished 14th in Jacarepaguá and retired in Long Beach with gearbox failure.

After the Chilean economic crisis in the early years of the 80&#x27;s, Salazar had to leave F1, and competed with little success at the Formula 3000 championship and the South American Formula Three Championship in some races. He began to race rally in Chile, becoming the champion of the 1985 hill-climbing season in Chile in a Toyota Corolla XT.

===Sports prototypes (1988–1990)===

In the late 1980s, Salazar drove some races in the FIA World Sports Prototype Championship. His best result was 1st place at the C-1 class in the 1988 Fuji 1000 km in Japan with a Spice SE88C-Ford of the Spice Engineering team. Thanks to his contacts with Tom Walkinshaw, he joined the Jaguar Silk Cut factory team, to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the 1989 race, the Chilean, with Alain and Michel Ferté, achieved the 8th place with the Jaguar XJR-9; but his best result would be winning the 1990 event of the historic race in a Jaguar XJR-12, but after driving several hours in the No. 3 car, he was forced to leave his seat to the British driver Martin Brundle, who received the chequered flag, and Salazar was forced to move to the No. 4 car, which retired at 20 hours with mechanical problems (Brundle&#x27;s original car, the No. 1, was pulled out at 14 hours for electrical problems). For that particular fact, he was named the 1990 Sportsman of the Year by the British magazine &quot;Autosport&quot;.

===Career in USA (1994–2002)===
After years with no competition, working as a co-host in the TV show &quot;Video Loco&quot; (America&#x27;s Funniest Videos&#x27; Chilean version, broadcast in Canal 13), Salazar received an opportunity to join the Ferrari-Momo factory team for the 1994 IMSA Sport Prototype championship in the WSC (World Sport Car) series, with the Italian Gianpiero Moretti. He raced at the Exxon World Sports Car Championship in 1994 and 1995 with several races won and podiums with the Ferrari 333 SP. Those results were good enough to pull him to the Indy Car World Series.

He signed a contract with the Dick Simon Racing in 1995 to race in the CART Indy Car World Series, with a strong debut at the Indy 500. With a Lola-Cosworth, he started 33rd and finished 4th in the Cristal-Copec-Mobil 1 No.7.

When the IRL and CART split in 1996, Salazar chose to compete in the new series. He became a regular top driver at Indy 500 with four Top 10 results. His best result at Indianapolis was in 2000, when he started and finished on 3rd place, at the wheel of a G-Force-Oldsmobile Aurora for A. J. Foyt Enterprises.

In 1997, Salazar earned his first and only victory in IRL racing, at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, racing for Team Scandia. That year, he also made his only start at a NASCAR sanctioned race, finishing 17th on the Watkins Glen International road course, in the Craftsman Truck Series.

2000 and 2001 were the best years in the IRL for Salazar, finishing 4th and 5th in those championships, with five top 5 results in 2000. In 2002, he suffered a serious accident testing at Indianapolis, and was forced miss several races. After much consideration Salazar decided to retire from Indy Car racing and focus on Sports Cars.

Salazar later joined the American Le Mans Series, where he raced in a Porsche 911 GT3 and a Ferrari 360.

===Present and future (2004–)===
Salazar then returned to Chile where, in 2004, he joined the official Hyundai rally team in the Rally Mobil, the national rally championship. His car was an N3-class Hyundai Coupe GK 2.0L.

In November 2005, Salazar competed in the inaugural race of the Grand Prix Masters, as a late replacement for Alan Jones. In 2006 he raced in both GPM races in Qatar and England.

In 2007, Salazar moved to the N4-class of the Rally Mobil, the Chilean Rally Championship, driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo IX, and was 5th in his first year at the N4-Class with a car of the ING Team.

His last international project is to race the Lisboa-Dakar rally, with the objective of being the first driver to have raced in the Monaco Grand Prix, the Le Mans 24 Hours, the 24 Hours of Daytona, the Indianapolis 500 and the Dakar Rally. In February he signed a pre-contract with Jean-Louis Schlesser to drive one of his buggies at the 2008 Dakar Rally, but he could not get a deal with a sponsor and that year&#x27;s running of the Dakar Rally was cancelled anyway.

In 2008, Salazar raced in the Rally Mobil with his own team, formed by 3 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo IX in the N4-Class.

He made his debut in the Dakar Rally in 2009 with a McRae Prototype, finishing in 88th place. He will compete in the 2010 edition as part of the Team Dakar USA, in a third Hummer H3, in addition to the ones raced by owner Robby Gordon and Frenchman Eric Vigouroux.

In 2013, Salazar introduced autocross (aka &quot;solo racing&quot;) to Chile, with the first event being held 6 April 2013 at Estadio Monumental in Santiago. In September 2013, he participated in the Sports Car Club of America Solo National Championships in Lincoln, Nebraska, driving a C Prepared Ford Mustang.

==Personal life==
On 15 May 2001, Salazar had a son, also named Eliseo. The younger Salazar attended his first Indy 500 at the age of 8 days old.

<text>Frederick Cockayne Elton VC (23 April 1832 – 24 March 1888) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Elton was born in Whitestaunton, Somerset, to Reverend William Tierney Elton and Lucy Caroline Elton, daughter of Sir Charles Abraham Elton, 6th Baronet. His paternal grandmother was Catherine Bayard, a descendant of Nicholas Bayard, Stephanus Van Cortlandt and the Schuyler family, all from British North America. Nicholas&#x27;s mother was Ann Stuyvesant, who was a sister of Peter Stuyvesant.

He was 22 years old, and a Brevet Major in the 55th Regiment of Foot, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 March 1855 at Sebastopol, the Crimea, Major Elton, with a small number of men, drove off a party of Russians who were destroying one of the new detached works, taking one prisoner himself. On 7 June he was the first to lead his men from the trenches. On 4 August he was in command of a working party in the advanced trenches in front of the Quarries, encouraging his men to work under very heavy fire and even used a pick and shovel himself to set an example.

Elton also received the French Legion d&#x27;Honneur and the Turkish Order of Medjidie.

<text>Thomas Esmonde, VC (25 May 1829 – 14 January 1872) was a British Army officer and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and family==
Esmonde was born in Pembrokestown, County Waterford, the son of Commander James Esmonde of the Royal Navy. His older brother was Sir John Esmonde, 10th Baronet, and he was the great-uncle of Eugene Esmonde, who was to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War.

Esmonde was educated at the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College, County Kildare, from 1840 to 1846. In 1851 he was commissioned as an ensign in the 18th Royal Irish Regiment and served with them in the Second Burmese and Crimean Wars, gaining promotion to captain in April 1855.

==VC action==

Esmonde was a 26 years old captain in the 18th Regiment of Foot (later The Royal Irish Regiment) in the British Army during the siege of Sebastopol, Crimean War, when the following deeds took place on the 18 and 20 June 1855 for which he was awarded the VC:
For his Crimean service, Esmonde was also made a Brevet Major in December 1857. He received his VC from Queen Victoria on 2 August 1858 at Southsea, Hampshire.

==Later years==
In November 1858, Esmonde married Matilda O&#x27;Kelly, with whom he had five children. In May 1865 he was appointed Deputy Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabulary, while remaining in the army on half-pay on the unattached list, where he was promoted to Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in December 1868. He formally retired from the army in April 1871.

While out hunting in Belgium, Esmonde suffered a severe eye injury when his horse rode into a bush. This led to his hospitalisation and ultimately caused his death in Bruges on 14 January 1872, at St Julian&#x27;s Hospital. He was buried at the . In 2017 his grave was restored by volunteers from the Victoria Cross Trust.

Esmonde&#x27;s medals, including his VC, are in the possession of the Esmonde family, and have been loaned to the Imperial War Museum in London for display in the Ashcroft Gallery.

<text>Enrique Antônio Langue e Silvério de Bernoldi (; born 19 October 1978) is a Brazilian professional racing driver who raced for the Arrows Formula One team in 2001 and 2002, and was the test driver for British American Racing (later Honda) between 2004 and 2006. He entered IndyCar racing in 2008, and competed in the FIA GT World Championship between 2009 and 2011, in addition to entering multiple other competitions.

==Racing career==

===Early career===
Bernoldi was born on 19 October 1978, in Curitiba, Paraná. He originally wanted to be a jockey because he liked horses but he received a go-kart from his parents as a gift for his seventh birthday. Bernoldi gained the inspiration to drive from watching fellow compatriots Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna. He began karting when he was nine years old, and he won multiple regional and national titles. Bernoldi won the Brazilian Paulista Kart Championship every year from 1989 to 1991 and claimed title honours in the Brazilian Kart Championship in 1990 and 1991. He went on to finish third at the 1992 Paulista Kart Championship in Brazil as well as placing third in the 1993 South American Kart Championship and fourth in the 1993 Pan-American Kart Championship. 

He travelled to Europe at age 16 to begin his car racing career. He entered the Formula Alfa Boxer series in Italy, where he finished fourth in his first race. Following a successful single entry in the Championnat de France Formule Renault, Bernoldi then entered the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 and won on his debut, the final round of the series. The following year he took in nine victories in eleven rounds and the title, before entering British Formula Three with the Promatecme team in 1997. Bernoldi was hospitalised after he was involved in a road traffic accident in January 1997 and required physiotherapy to recover in time for his F3 debut two months later. He took his first victory at Spa-Francorchamps en route to fifth in the championship, and also finished third at that year&#x27;s Macau Grand Prix. Bernoldi remained with Promatecme for 1998 to take six more victories, and he was able to finish runner-up to compatriot Mario Haberfeld. He finished second at the 1998 Masters of Formula 3 and third at the 1998 Macau Grand Prix.

In 1999, Bernoldi progressed to the International Formula 3000 championship with the Red Bull Junior Team and drove the Lola T99/50-Zytek car. Although his debut season only resulted in two points accumulated in a single event out of a possible ten for 18th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, he was retained by the team for the following year, finishing that season 16th in the points standings with five points scored in three of the ten rounds he raced. He was frequently fastest in late-year testing for the 2001 season and was the favourite to win that year&#x27;s championship. Bernoldi would not participate in the series that year.

Due to the Red Bull Junior Team&#x27;s links with Sauber, he tested for the Formula 1 team in both seasons, in addition to also testing for the Prost Grand Prix team in 2000. Although touted before the start of the 2001 season to be joining either Prost, Minardi, or Sauber, Bernoldi instead signed a three-year contract to drive for the Arrows squad with the option to extend his stay at the team for a further two years after his first season with them. He replaced the contracted Pedro de la Rosa because Bernoldi had provided Arrows with a budget.

===Formula One===

Driving the A22-Asiatech car during the 2001 season, Bernoldi performed respectably for the Arrows team, occasionally matching his more experienced teammate Jos Verstappen for pace in qualifying but performed less well than Verstappen during races. However, he gained notoriety for his efforts at the Monaco Grand Prix, where he held up the much faster McLaren car of David Coulthard for 35 laps; after a botched start, Coulthard had been fighting his way through the field, only to be stuck behind the Arrows, prompting irate responses from both Coulthard and McLaren team principal Ron Dennis. Bernoldi was defended by his team boss Tom Walkinshaw, who hit back at McLaren. He failed to score any points in 2001 due to the car&#x27;s engine being unreliable and Bernoldi making driver errors, with 10 retirements from 17 starts, his highest finish being an eighth at the German Grand Prix. He did however improve his driving by the end of the season but did not contribute to improving the car&#x27;s technical aspects. Bernoldi concluded the season without any scoring points in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Even though Verstappen was the only Arrows driver to score points in 2001, Bernoldi was retained by Arrows for the 2002 championship, being partnered by Heinz-Harald Frentzen and drove one of the team&#x27;s A23-Cosworth vehicles. At Sepang he notably overtook Michael Schumacher, having been passed by the German as he attempted to fight through the field after a first-lap incident with Juan Pablo Montoya, although his driving in that race was criticised by Allan McNish. Due to serious financial problems, Arrows were forced to withdraw three-quarters of the way into the 2002 season. Bernoldi thus again did not score any points in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in the 11 races he entered. He subsequently switched to the World Series by Nissan to try and rebuild his reputation, after a potential drive for Jordan Grand Prix failed to materialise due to legal constraints.

===2003–2007===
In his debut season in the World Series by Nissan, Bernoldi finished sixth in the championship, having won two races. He also participated in a &quot;mega test&quot;, held by Alfa Romeo, with a prospect of driving for the team in the 2004 European Touring Car Championship. Despite this test, he continued in the World Series in 2004, and finished third overall, with another pair of wins. In mid-2004 he was named a test driver for BAR, completing two tests at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain, in order to prevent the regular BAR drivers having to make several long-distance trips. He remained with the team after these sessions, also undertaking tests of BAR&#x27;s &quot;Concept Car&quot; (a hybrid F1 car with a 2004 frontal setup mixed with a 2005 rear setup). He remained BAR&#x27;s test driver for 2005, but began to look for pastures new in 2006, participating in less tests for the now-renamed Honda Racing F1 Team - although he did remain as official test driver. Although he impressed in Champ Car during a test for Rocketsports, his solitary race during 2006 came in Argentina&#x27;s TC 2000 series. In 2007, Bernoldi competed in the Stock Car Brasil, competing in 11 of the 12 races and finishing 13th in the championship, with his best results being a pair of podium finishes.

===IndyCar Series===

For 2008 Bernoldi, signed a contract with Rocketsports for the 2008 Champ Car World Series. However, following the reunification of Champ Car and the Indy Racing League, Rocketsports withdrew, opting not to compete in the new, combined, series. It was later announced that Bernoldi would drive for Conquest Racing in the newly combined series&#x27; 2008 season. His best result was fourth, in the final Champ Car-sanctioned race at Long Beach. His best result in the reunified IndyCar Series was fifteenth at the 2008 Indianapolis 500. A collision with teammate Jamie Camara at Watkins Glen lead him to publicly criticize the team, and speculation that he might leave them. A thumb injury ruled him out of the final two races of the season, his seat being filled by Alex Tagliani.

===2009–present===
For 2009, Bernoldi was the full-time driver of Flamengo in the Superleague open wheel series and also he ran a partial schedule in Stock Car Brasil. He also competed in the FIA GT Championship for Sangari Team Brazil, taking his first win at Paul Ricard.

In 2010, he raced in the new FIA GT1 World Championship for Vitaphone Racing, scoring the pole position and winning his home race at Interlagos.

For 2011, he continued to race in the series, campaigning a Nissan GT-R for the Sumo Power GT team. He also entered four races of the GT Brasil, driving for Ford GT Racing Team BMG.

In 2012, he drove for Vita4One Team Italy in the Italian GT Championship, followed by appearances for AF Waltrip in the FIA World Endurance Championship, before making his debut in the International GT Open, driving once more for AF Corse in a Ferrari 458 GT2. He also made his debut in the SPEED EuroSeries, driving for Team JD in a Tatuus CN, whilst entering the 500 Milhas de Kart do Beto Carreiro at the end of the year. In 2013, he entered the International Challenge of the Stars, run by Felipe Massa.

<text>Major William Mordaunt Marsh Edwards, (7 May 1855 – 17 September 1912) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Edwards was the son and heir of Henry William Bartholomew, of Hardingham Hall, Norfolk. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He did not take a degree at Cambridge, but joined the Army. He was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant on the Unattached List on 22 March 1876, and in January 1877 joined the 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot, with the rank of lieutenant.

==Victoria Cross==
Edwards was 27 years old, and serving as a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, during the British occupation of Egypt when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 September 1882 at Tel-el-Kebir, Egypt, Lieutenant Edwards led a party of the Highland Light Infantry to storm a redoubt. The lieutenant who was in advance of his party, rushed alone into the battery, killed the artillery officer in charge and was himself knocked down by a gunner with a rammer and was rescued only by the timely arrival of three men of his regiment. He was severely wounded.

==Later career==
Edwards was promoted to captain on 23 March 1887. He served as adjutant of the 3rd Battalion, HLI, from 1 January 1892, until 1 November 1893, and was promoted to major on 4 September 1895. Edwards retired from the army on 11 November 1896.

On 19 February 1899, on the nomination of Lord Belper, he was appointed one of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, and on 13 August 1900 he was commissioned as a deputy lieutenant of the County of Norfolk.

<doc id="1219780" wikidata="Q171546" url="?curid=1219780" title="Éric Bernard">
<text>Éric Bernard (born 24 August 1964) is a retired French Formula One racing driver, who drove in Formula One from 1989 to 1994 for the Ligier, Larrousse and Lotus teams. His best finish in Formula One was third place at the German Grand Prix in 1994. After his Formula One career ended, he raced sportscars.

==Early career==
Bernard was born in Martigues, near Marseille. He started karting in 1976 and in the seven years that followed, won four French titles. In 1983 he attended racing school at Paul Ricard and was one of the finalists at the Volant Elf competition. He beat Jean Alesi and Bertrand Gachot to the prize, earning himself a fully sponsored drive in Formula Renault for 1984. He finished sixth in the series, but won the following year, and entering French Formula Three in 1986. He won the series the following year, finishing in second place for the championship, behind his old rival, Alesi. In 1988 he entered Formula 3000. He drove the initial part of the season for the Ralt Team before switching to Bromley Motorsport which ran a Reynard chassis. His best finish that year was second at the Dijon-Prenois and placed 9th in the championship with 13 points. For 1989, he drove for the DAMS team, scoring one win and placing 3rd in the championship with 25 points.

==Formula One==
In mid-1989, Bernard was called up to the French Larrousse Formula One team for the French Grand Prix, replacing Yannick Dalmas. On his debut, he ran as high as 5th place, and was still in 7th when his Lamborghini V12 engine failed a few laps from the end (Alesi also debuted at the race for Tyrrell, running as high as 2nd before finally finishing 4th). Bernard stood in again at the following British Grand Prix, before returning to his Formula 3000 commitments with DAMS.

Bernard was rewarded with a full-season drive for Larrousse in 1990. He took his first point for 6th place at the Monaco Grand Prix, and his best result came at Silverstone in the British Grand Prix, where he took 4th place. He elected to stay on at Larrousse for the 1991 season, but the team were in trouble, losing their Lamborghini engines to the quasi-works Modena team, having their 1990 points stripped by the FIA, and also losing sponsors. Bernard took 6th place in the Mexican Grand Prix, which was the last points finish for Larrousse with Lola Cars, but slipped back down the field, failing to qualify for the first time in his career at the Portuguese Grand Prix - partially due to a bereavement. Worse was to come, however, when Bernard broke his leg in the first practice session for the Japanese Grand Prix.

Bernard fought back to fitness, and for the 1993 season his old sponsors Elf managed to get him into a test driver seat for the Ligier team. The two-year testing contract paid off, as a team backer was jailed for fraud before the 1994 season, and the reduced budget saw Bernard promoted to a race seat, alongside rookie Olivier Panis. Sadly for Bernard, Panis largely outpaced him, and the team&#x27;s Renault V10 engine was counterweighted by the team using a &quot;B&quot;-spec version of the 1993 JS39 chassis - by this time a very unusual practice in Formula One which greatly harmed competitiveness. Bernard took third place in the high-attrition German Grand Prix, but by the European Grand Prix he was dropped in order to accommodate Johnny Herbert. He was engaged by Herbert&#x27;s previous team, Team Lotus, to fill the seat at the European GP, but it was to be his last F1 drive, with Mika Salo taking over later in the season. For 1995, he was linked to a return to Larrousse, but the team folded before the season began.

==Sportscars==
Bernard moved to sportscars, enjoying considerable success in GT and ALMS series.

<doc id="1219783" wikidata="Q7737077" url="?curid=1219783" title="The Golden Master">
<text>The Golden Master (1939) is an American pulp novel featuring The Shadow, written by Walter Gibson under the house name Maxwell Grant. This was the 182nd Shadow story and it was published in &quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot; Vol. 31, No. 2 on 15 September 1939.

It has the first appearance of the hero&#x27;s archenemy Shiwan Khan, and deals with a scheme by Khan to conquer the world by hypnotizing arms manufacturers.

==Plot summary==
Shiwan Khan, heir to Genghis Khan, is in the United States to steal military technology in order to build his own army with the intent of conquering the world. He hypnotises Paul Brent of Globe Aircraft through the electronic lights of a nearby billboard. He orders him to create a larger production run of aircraft than originally intended, with the excess being sent on to Shiwan Khan. By similar methods, he also acquired engines and weapons.

The Shadow enters the story when Shiwan Khan attempts to dispose of Paul Brent. Working with Brent, The Shadow eventually tracks his opponent to his base of operations and apparently kills him when his escape plane crashes into the river.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Golden Master&quot; was submitted 13 February 1939 and saw print in the pulp magazine &quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot; on 15 September of the same year.

The story was republished in the hard back book &quot;The Shadow and the Golden Master&quot; published in 1984 by Mysterious Press. This book also contained a second Shiwan Khan story, &quot;Shiwan Khan Returns&quot;. In addition to the standard edition, there was also a signed and numbered limited edition of 250 copies in a slipcover.

==Characters ==
*The Shadow
*Shiwan Khan: The Shadow&#x27;s archenemy first appeared in this story and would return three more times in the pulps:
** &quot;Shiwan Khan Returns&quot; (December 1939)
** &quot;The Invincible Shiwan Khan&quot; (March 1940)
** &quot;Masters of Death&quot; (May 1940)

Shiwan Khan is a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. As a youth, he travelled to Lhasa, Tibet and studied with the monks. However, while trying to later use his knowledge to help the people of Mongolia, he began to feel a lust for power and set out to rule the world as a new Khan.

He operates from the lost underground city of Xanadu, beneath the Sinkiang. He has access to the treasures of Kublai Khan and has been trained by the Tibetan monks to use telepathic powers - &quot;the power of the distant mind.&quot; He can also appear invisible to most people by staying completely still and suspending his &quot;action of thought.&quot;
*Paul Brent: Technical expert for Globe Aircraft. Recently back from South America, after arranging final order specs and hypnotized into providing equipment for Shiwan Khan&#x27;s army, Brent is the viewpoint character for much of the story.

*Guy Chadbury: Has controlling interests in several munitions companies and is under Shiwan&#x27;s control/influence.

**Alice Haywood: A pseudonym for Beatrice Chadbury, although she believes she is really Lana Luan playing an American.
*Benjamin Twindell: A wealthy and eccentric New York jewel collector.
*Herbert Thorner: Twindell&#x27;s representative.
*Dr. Roy Tam: An influential Chinese businessman who had often cooperated with The Shadow in the past.
*Loo Look: A Chinese merchant employed by Shiwan Khan.
*Mitchell Dorron: Manager of the Tropical Export Line and had worked for Shiwan Khan previously.
*Flash Gidley: Manhattan&#x27;s cautious and strategic big shot.
*Herk Duvan: Gidley&#x27;s lieutenant, prefers strong arm tactics to strategy.

<text>Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter () is the seventh novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa. It was published by Seix Barral, S.A., Spain, in 1977. 

==Plot==
Set in Peru during the 1950s, it is the story of an 18-year-old student who falls for a 32-year-old divorcee. The novel is based on the author&#x27;s real life experience.

Mario, an aspiring writer, works at a radio station, Panamericana, writing news bulletins alongside the disaster-obsessed Pascual. Mario has an aunt (married to a biological uncle) whose sister, Julia, has just been divorced and has come to live with some of his family members. He frequently sees her and though at first they do not get on, they start to go to movies together and gradually become romantically involved, ultimately getting married. 

Mario&#x27;s bosses also run Panamericana&#x27;s sister station, which broadcasts &quot;novelas&quot; (short-run soap operas). They are having problems buying the serials in bulk from Cuba, with batches of scripts being ruined and quality being poor, and so they hire an eccentric Bolivian scriptwriter named Pedro Camacho to write the serials.

The novel chronicles the scriptwriter&#x27;s rise in popularity, and subsequent descent into madness, in tandem with the protagonist&#x27;s affair. It alternates between Mario&#x27;s account of his life and episodes of Camacho&#x27;s serials, which become increasingly unhinged as the novel progresses.

==Background==
The novel is based in part on the author&#x27;s first marriage, to Julia Urquidi. Urquidi later wrote a memoir, &quot;Lo que Varguitas no dijo&quot; (&quot;What little Vargas didn&#x27;t say&quot;), in which she provided her own version of their relationship.

Vargas Llosa&#x27;s novel was later adapted as a Hollywood feature film, &quot;Tune in Tomorrow&quot;, in which the setting was moved from Lima to New Orleans. The film was released as &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot; in many countries.

<text>Érik Gilbert Comas (; born 28 September 1963) is a French former racing driver. He was the French Formula 3 champion in 1988, and then Formula 3000 champion in 1990, after scoring the same number of points as Jean Alesi in 1989, but losing on a count-back of positions. He participated in 63 Formula One Grands Prix between 1991 and 1994, scoring a total of seven championship points. His last point, in the 1994 German Grand Prix, was also the last one for the Larrousse team. After his F1 career, he won the All-Japan GT Championship for Nismo in the top GT500 class in 1998 and 1999.

==Career==

===Formula One===

====1991 and 1992: Ligier====
After his F3000 championship victory in 1990, Comas was selected to drive for the Ligier F1 team in 1991. The Ligier JS35 with its Lamborghini engine proved uncompetitive throughout the season. Comas failed to qualify for the race on his first attempt in Brazil, achieved his first finish with 10th at Imola, and achieved his highest finish of the season with 8th in Canada, scoring no points during the season. Although he failed to qualify on two other occasions and suffered a spectacular crash at Hockenheim, he generally compared well with more experienced teammate Thierry Boutsen who also failed to score any points. Early in 1992, Comas&#x27;s place in the team was briefly threatened by Alain Prost who tested the team&#x27;s new Renault-powered car with a view to driving for, and possibly buying the team, with Comas revealing years later that he had not been given any testing mileage during the winter. Ultimately Prost chose not to proceed, and Comas retained his drive alongside Boutsen for the season. The 1992 car, the Ligier JS37 seemed promising, a brand new design featuring the race-winning Renault V10 engine, but it proved to be only inconsistently competitive. Comas scored his first career F1 point with 6th place in Canada, scored 5th at Ligier&#x27;s home race in France and a further point in Germany during a mid-season revival of the team&#x27;s fortunes. With four points, he was generally faster than and outscored Boutsen, and finished 11th in the Driver&#x27;s Championship. At the 1992 Belgian Grand Prix Comas was involved in a severe accident at the Blanchimont corner during Saturday qualifying. Left unconscious in his car beached in the middle of the track with the engine still running at its rev limiter, Comas was rescued by Ayrton Senna who stopped his own car and ran to help Comas, by shutting off the car&#x27;s screaming engine (which was still pumping fuel and could have blown at any moment starting a fire), and holding the Frenchman&#x27;s head in a stable position until medical assistance arrived. Comas credited Senna with saving his life.

====1993 and 1994: Larrousse====
Comas was not retained by Ligier for 1993; he instead signed with the small Larrousse team, running the LH93 chassis powered by Lamborghini V12s. The car was uncompetitive, Comas retiring from half the 16 races of the season, and scoring only one point for 6th at Monza. 

Retained by Larrousse in 1994, Comas drove the LH94 car, now powered by more reliable Ford HB engines. Comas scored a point for 6th at the Pacific Grand Prix, and benefited from the retirement of many other cars to take another point at Hockenheim. This was both his and Larrousse&#x27;s final F1 points finish. For the last race of the season in Australia, Comas relinquished his seat to make way for Jean-Denis Delétraz who brought more funding to the team.

At the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix due to a radio miscommunication Comas was released onto the track during the red flag after Senna had crashed, arriving at the Tamburello corner where he met the workers and vehicles, including an aid helicopter which had landed at the scene. Having had to brake hard to avoid hitting either marshals, their vehicles, or the helicopter Comas declined to participate in the restart of the race, after witnessing medical staff treating the mortally-injured Senna.

===After Formula One===

After ending his Formula One career at the end of the 1994 season, Comas went to Japan to continue his racing career in the All-Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (JGTC), Japan&#x27;s premiere racing series. He won the GT500 title in 1998 and 1999, and was runner-up in the standings in 2000, all three years driving for Nissan in a factory Nismo-prepared Skyline GT-R. He left the Nismo team in 2002 to join the factory Toyota team the following year. By the end of the 2003 season, he was the most successful driver in the history of the series, with the most career championship points ever scored by a single driver. This was eventually surpassed by another Nismo driver, Satoshi Motoyama.

Comas spent the 2004/2005 seasons with Masahiro Hasemi&#x27;s privateer Hasemi Sport team, running non-factory Nissan 350Zs in GT500, including inheriting the team&#x27;s only win (co-driving with Toshihiro Kaneishi) thus far, on the evening of 18 December 2004 at the &quot;All-Star 200&quot; exhibition race on California Speedway&#x27;s combined oval/road course after the unofficial winners were penalized 60 seconds on their finishing time for a pit window infraction. The race was a non-points scoring event and as such does not count towards the drivers&#x27; or teams&#x27; official win record.

In the 2006 Super GT championship season (formerly JGTC) he raced for former JGTC driver and 24 Hours of Le Mans team owner Masahiko Kondo&#x27;s new privateer Nissan 350Z racing team. He also branched out into rallying, competing in various events around the world. Along with this, he created Comas Racing Management (CRM), a firm that focuses on the management and development of young up and coming drivers, primarily from his home country of France.

At the fifth race of the 2006 season at Sportsland SUGO, Comas was replaced by Seiji Ara due to ill health. After returning for the Pokka 1000 km, on 5 September 2006, Comas announced that because of his health, he would not compete in the final three races of the season.

In 2010 and 2011, he won the electric vehicle category of the &quot;Rallye Monte Carlo des Véhicules à Énergie Alternative&quot; (the opening event of the FIA Alternative Energies Cup) with a Tesla Roadster. In 2014 he won the Carrera Panamericana in a Studebaker. Between 2012 and 2017, he rallied a Lancia Stratos.

Comas has now retired from all forms of racing. He spends his time running Comas Historic Racing, which provides for paying customers to enter historic rallies driving cars from his fleet of blue Alpine automobiles. In 2019 Comas obtained one of the Nissan R390 GT1, a car he competed in the 1998 Le Mans 24 Hours with, and had it restored as well as being made street-legal.

<text>William Gregg VC DCM MM (27 January 1890 – 10 August 1969) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 28 years old, and a sergeant in the 13th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 8 May 1918 at Bucquoy, France, when all the officers of Sergeant Gregg&#x27;s company had been hit during an attack on an enemy outpost, he took command, rushing two enemy posts, killing some of the gun teams, taking prisoners and capturing a machine-gun. He then started to consolidate his position until driven back by a counter-attack, but as reinforcements had by now come up, he led a charge, personally bombed a hostile machine-gun, killed the crew and captured the gun. When driven back again, he led another successful attack and held on to his position until ordered to withdraw.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of company sergeant-major and served in World War II with the Sherwood Foresters.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England.

==Local honours==
William lived in Heanor, Derbyshire, and as testament to his deeds of gallantry when the town&#x27;s new swimming baths were built in 1970 they were named the &#x27;William Gregg V.C Swimming Baths&#x27; in his honour. That recognition was continued when the facilities were extended and privatised in 2009-10 as the &#x27;William Gregg V.C. Leisure Centre.

<text>Eric Francis Edouard Ghislain Thérèse van de Poele (; born 30 September 1961) is a Belgian racing driver and former Formula One driver. He participated in 29 Grands Prix, in 1991 and 1992. He is a three-times class winner at 24 Hours of Le Mans, and won three Formula 3000 races in 1990. Before his Formula One career, he won the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft.

==Driving career==

After a difficult 1984 season in French Formula Three, van de Poele then won the Belgian and Benelux Formula Ford titles, also racing in the Belgian Touring Car Championship. He subsequently raced in German Touring Cars Championships, winning the 1987 championship despite not winning a race all season. He also won the 1987 Spa 24 Hours, sharing a car with Didier Theys and Jean-Michel Martin. He also dabbled in British Formula 3. For 1989, he moved up to Formula 3000, finishing fourth, and then runner-up in 1990.

After this, he signed for the Modena Formula One team for 1991, driving their Lamborghini cars thanks to backing from long-time sponsors LeasePlan. He qualified onto the grid at his third attempt, for the 1991 San Marino Grand Prix. There he impressed in the rain, running fifth in the last lap before the car ran out of fuel, dropping him to ninth. The team, in financial difficulties, was unable to build on this success, and van de Poele would not race again that year.

He then signed for Brabham in 1992, but the team were low on money. He qualified for the opening South African Grand Prix, finishing 13th, but did not manage to qualify the outdated car again. He frequently matched team-mate Damon Hill in the other Brabham, however. For the Hungarian Grand Prix he switched to the promising Fondmetal team. He qualified the car at the first attempt, only to spin out. He then started an excellent 15th for the Belgian Grand Prix, finishing 10th, and qualified again for the Italian Grand Prix, only for the clutch to break. After this, Fondmetal also hit money troubles and withdrew, leaving van de Poele without a drive.Aside from a largely unused capacity as test driver for Tyrrell in 1993, van de Poele has since found considerable success in Touring Cars and sports cars, winning the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1995 and 1996 and the Petit Le Mans in 1998. He has also added to his 1987 win in the Spa 24 Hours with four more wins in 1998, 2005, 2006 and 2008, giving him the record of five wins in the event. In 2008, van de Poele competed in the Rolex Sports Car Series.

<text>Fabrizio Barbazza (born 2 April 1963) is an Italian former Formula One driver who raced for the AGS and Minardi teams and was the 1987 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year.

==Career==

===Early career===
Barbazza was born in Monza, Lombardy. After a career in motocross in his teens, he began racing Formula Monza in 1982. The following year, he moved into Italian Formula Three Championship and, in 1984, finished sixth in the series. In 1985, he won four races and finished third in the championship. He then went to the United States and entered the American Racing Series, where he won five races and the title in his first attempt.

===CART, F3000, and Formula One===
After his success in ARS, Barbazza entered CART in 1987 and finished third in the 1987 Indianapolis 500, becoming CART&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. Despite his success he could not find a ride in CART for 1988 and only made two starts in Formula 3000, along with failing to qualify three times. He returned to CART for 1989 for eight races with a best finish of eighth at Toronto. He also drove in eight Japanese Formula 3000 races.

In 1990 he joined International F3000 full-time driving for the Crypton team, finishing 16th in points with a best finish of fourth at his home track in Monza, his only point-scoring finish of the season. For 1991 Barbazza signed on with the struggling AGS Formula One team for the third round of the championship, replacing Stefan Johansson. Barbazza failed to qualify for all twelve races he attempted with the team and the team shut down after both Barbazza and his teammate Olivier Grouillard both failed to pre-qualify for the 1991 Spanish Grand Prix. For the 1992 racing season, Barbazza again returned to the Arciero team in CART. However, after respectable performances in two-year-old equipment for the first three races of the season, he wrecked his 1990-vintage Lola in practice for the 1992 Indianapolis 500 and was not able to qualify. It would be his last appearance in CART. In 1993 Barbazza rejoined Formula One with the Minardi team, scoring points twice in his first four races. However, Barbazza would be replaced by Pierluigi Martini after eight races. In 1995, while racing a Ferrari 333SP sports prototype at the Road Atlanta circuit, he was involved in a major accident with Jeremy Dale, which resulted in heavy head and chest injuries which left him in critical condition, in a coma and on artificial respiration. Although he fully recovered, he did not return to racing. Instead he started a go-kart circuit in Monza and began designing crash barriers.

He has since relocated to Cuba where he has set up a fishing resort in the north of the country called La Villa Clara. He has also raced again, at a local karting track in Cuba, where he has re-discovered his love for the sport.

<text>François Hesnault (born 30 December 1956) is a former racing driver from France. He participated in 21 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 25 March 1984. He scored no championship points.

Hesnault was born to a wealthy family who owned a large transport business. He did his military service in the French parachute corps and was involved in action in West Africa. Hesnault made his racing debut competing in the French Formula Renault in 1980. He enjoyed some success in the French Formula Three Championship, finishing third in the series with two race victories in 1982 and second in 1983 with five race wins and battled Michel Ferté for the series title that he lost out by two points. Hesnault competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice, firstly in and again in .

The Frenchman debuted in Formula One in the season with Ligier, with a best result of 7th at the Dutch Grand Prix. For the season, he was hired to be Nelson Piquet&#x27;s teammate at Brabham, but he was sacked after four uncompetitive races. He returned for a one-off at the German Grand Prix in a third Renault which carried a prototype onboard camera, making it the first use of this technology in a Grand Prix. This is also the last race in which three cars have been entered for the same team (current third drivers are not eligible to compete in the races). After this race, Hesnault retired from motor racing, having suffered a particularly heavy crash in testing at Circuit Paul Ricard shortly before parting company with Brabham.

<text>Joseph John Farmer VC (15 May 1854 – 30 June 1930) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
He attended school in King&#x27;s Cross, and thereafter was apprenticed to the building trade. However, at the age of 13 years he went to sea with the Mercantile Marine serving aboard English and American ships. In 1875, he was shipwrecked off the Isle of Wight, and again a year later in a hurricane off Hong Kong. He left the sea in 1878, and on returning home he fell ill with smallpox.

Whilst still under medical care he saved the life of a delirious patient who tried to jump out of a window. When he had recovered from his illness, he took an appointment as a night porter to look after demented patients. Another similar appointment followed, and after having his interest in medical matters further awakened he joined the Army Hospital Corps on 27 February 1879. Following a course in anatomy and ambulance work he left for the Cape of Good Hope.
==Career==

When the South African War broke out he served in a Field Hospital. He then served in the relief column sent to the beleaguered garrisons of Potchefstroom and Lydenburg, and saw action at Laing&#x27;s Nek and again at Majuba Hill.
Farmer was first utilised treating the wounded from the Battle of Ulundi during the Anglo-Zulu War. He was 26 years old, and a provisional lance-corporal in the Army Hospital Corps (later Royal Army Medical Corps), British Army during the First Boer War when the following deed took place on 27 February 1881, at Majuba Hill in South Africa for which he was awarded the VC:
He later achieved the rank of corporal. He was forced to leave the army due to his wounds and joined the Corps of Commissionaires and then became a house-painter.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Aldershot, England.

<doc id="1219796" wikidata="Q173299" url="?curid=1219796" title="Gabriele Tarquini">
<text>Gabriele Tarquini (born 2 March 1962) is an Italian former racing driver. He participated in 78 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 3 May 1987. He scored a single championship point, and holds the record for the most failed attempts to qualify. He has subsequently raced successfully in Touring Cars, winning the BTCC in 1994, the ETCC in 2003 the WTCC in 2009 and the WTCR in 2018.

On 22 November 2009 he won the 2009 FIA World Touring Car Championship title at the age of 47 years and 266 days. This made him the oldest ever world champion in an FIA series, breaking Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s record of being FIA Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion at the age of 46 years and 41 days in 1957. Tarquini backed up this record by winning the 2018 FIA World Touring Car Cup at the age of 56 years and 259 days.

== Formula One ==
Tarquini began karting in 1976. By 1985 he was driving in Formula 3000, spending three seasons with underfunded outfits. His best result was 2nd at Imola in 1987, by which time he had already made his Grand Prix debut in a one-off drive for Osella at the 1987 San Marino Grand Prix.

He joined Coloni&#x27;s Grand Prix team for 1988, having driven for them in F3000 in 1986. The season saw a prequalifying system being put in place as there were 31 entrants for a maximum 30 places in qualifying proper. As such, the slowest of the new entrants for the season (Coloni, Rial, Dallara and EuroBrun) would be eliminated from proceedings after the Friday morning session regardless of their overall position - Tarquini failed to prequalify several times despite often being faster than some of the exempt entrants (such as the Osella and Zakspeed cars). He drew good notices for his performance overall, however - his 8th place at the Canadian Grand Prix would stand as the team&#x27;s best ever result and his eight starts the most ever garnered by a Coloni driver.

Tarquini signed to drive for the FIRST team (again a former employer in F3000) and drove for them at the Formula One Indoor Trophy, but when their car failed crash tests he started 1989 without a ride. Following Philippe Streiff&#x27;s career-ending pre-season testing crash, Tarquini joined Joachim Winkelhock in the AGS team from the second round of the series. There he finished a fine 8th on the road, being promoted to 6th after the exclusion of Thierry Boutsen and Alex Caffi. He was then one of the stars of the weekend in Monaco, threatening to qualify in the top 6 before ending up 13th on the grid. In the race he advanced to a strong 4th before being sidelined by an electrical problem. At the following Mexican Grand Prix he finished 6th, though the team&#x27;s joy was tempered after Williams and Scuderia Italia successfully appealed against their Imola disqualification and Tarquini lost his point. More bad luck followed at Phoenix where Tarquini was holding 6th despite technical problems before Boutsen passed him on the final lap. At the wet Canadian Grand Prix Tarquini again ran well until being shoved off the track by René Arnoux (who eventually went on to finish 5th). The series then moved to faster tracks where the AGS was less competitive and the results of others meant Tarquini&#x27;s entry (exempt for the first half of the season thanks to Streiff&#x27;s efforts in 1988) would have to prequalify for the second half of the season.

The expanding entry list meant prequalifying was very different from 1988, consisting of an hour-long free-for-all session on Friday morning between the less successful cars. Featuring the Larrousse cars of Michele Alboreto and Philippe Alliot, Roberto Moreno&#x27;s Coloni, the Osellas of Nicola Larini and Piercarlo Ghinzani and the Onyx cars of Stefan Johansson and Bertrand Gachot among others with only the four fastest going through both Tarquini and new teammate Yannick Dalmas struggled and Tarquini would not qualify again that year.

AGS attempted to move to larger premises for 1990 but a lack of resources and the late arrival of the JH25 left Tarquini and Dalmas again struggling to get past prequalifying, Tarquini only making it into four races (finishing just once - 13th in the Hungarian Grand Prix), his early 1989 form long forgotten by most. The team were under even more severe financial constraints for 1991, though they would initially at least avoid prequalifying. Tarquini made it through into three races, finishing a worthy 8th in the season opener at Phoenix but financial constraints meant after Monaco the AGS didn&#x27;t make the grid again.

Late in the season the cash-strapped team sold his contract to Gabriele Rumi&#x27;s ambitious Fondmetal outfit in time for the Spanish Grand Prix, soon forming a good relationship with the team. He was signed for a full year in 1992, showing some good speed in the neat but underdeveloped Fondmetal GR02 chassis. However, his car only finished once (14th at Silverstone, hindered by clutch problems) and despite some fine qualifying efforts (including outqualifying Ivan Capelli&#x27;s Ferrari in Belgium) the team struggled to find funding, folding after the following Italian Grand Prix and leaving Tarquini out of a drive.

Despite being firmly involved in his successful touring cars career and 33 years old, Tarquini was signed up by Tyrrell for the 1995 season as their test driver thanks to the presence of Fondmetal as a sponsor. He replaced Ukyo Katayama for the European round as the Japanese driver was injured from his start line accident in the previous race. Out of practice with single seaters (having done very little actual testing due to the team&#x27;s financial constraints) he finished 14th, six laps down on winner Michael Schumacher. It was his final Grand Prix, and to date, the last occasion a reigning BTCC Champion has competed in Formula One.

Tarquini failed to pre-qualify on a record 25 occasions (out of a total of 40 failures to qualify), mainly because he was a regular in the pre-qualifying era, usually in cars which were so slow as to struggle to qualify. Despite this record many consider him to have been a talented driver stuck with uncompetitive machinery (much like contemporary Roberto Moreno).

==Touring Cars==

===Italian Superturismo 1993===
====Alfa Romeo (1993)====
With the creation of D2 series in 1993, Tarquini passed to Alfa Romeo becoming their top driver and finishing third in Italian Superturismo behind Ravaglia and Giovanardi.

===BTCC 1994/1995===
====Alfa Romeo (1994–1995)====

The following year Tarquini moved to the British Touring Car Championship, winning the title at his first attempt in an Alfa Romeo featuring controversial aerodynamic enhancements. In 1995 Alfa Corse decided to move him back to Italian Superturismo Championship but after 2 victories, 4 third place and 6 DNF, Tarquini left the series and joined to Prodrive to help Alfa Romeo to achieve better results in BTCC.

===ITC 1996===
====Alfa Romeo (1996)====
In 1996 Tarquini raced in Class 1 Touring Cars with Alfa Romeo in ITC, where he achieved best results of 1 victory and 1 second place.

===BTCC 1997 ===
====Honda (1997)====
With the end of D1 Class, Tarquini left Alfa Romeo and signed a 5-year contract with Honda where he raced in BTCC again with Prodrive. The first season with Honda saw him finishing 6th in the general standings with 1 victory, 1 second and 3 third places.

===STW 1998/1999===
====Honda (1998–1999)====
In 1998 and 1999 Tarquini raced in Germany with JAS Motorsport in STW Cup where he got 2 victories and several podium.
===BTCC 2000===
====Honda (2000)====
After 2 years in Germany, Tarquini raced for the third time in BTCC.

===Euro STC 2001===
====Honda (2001)====
In his last season with Honda he raced in Euro STC where he finished third behind the 2 Alfa Romeo of Giovanardi and Larini although he got 9 victories.

===ETCC 2003/2004===
After spending 2002 without a car, in 2003 he came back to Alfa Romeo where he raced in the ETCC and he won the title at the first attempt as it happened 9 years before in BTCC. In 2004 for the last season of ETCC he was again the best of Alfa&#x27;s driver and he finished third behind the 2 BMW of Priaulx and Dirk Muller.

===WTCC===

====Alfa Romeo (2005)====
He remained with Alfa Romeo as the ETCC became the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) in 2005. He finished seventh overall, with two victories.

====SEAT Sport (2006–2009)====
In November 2005, Tarquini was confirmed as one of six drivers at SEAT Sport for 2006. He finished fifth in the championship that year with one win. He finished 8th in the standings in 2007, once again winning just one race. 2008 saw considerable improvement for Tarquini as he finished runner-up in the championship to Yvan Muller winning three races. His biggest success of his career came in 2009 when he won the WTCC championship at the last race of the year in Macau.

====Sunred (2010–2011)====

SEAT withdrew from the WTCC for 2010, but provided funding to introduce the new semi-works SR-Sport team, with whom Tarquini attempted to retain his crown. He scored five wins during the season to finish runner-up to ex-SEAT Sport teammate Yvan Muller in the drivers standings. This was after four victories, plus an inherited victory in Belgium from Jordi Gene after Gene&#x27;s disqualification. His crash in Japan race two ended his title hopes.

In 2011, Tarquini drove for the Lukoil-SUNRED team alongside Aleksei Dudukalo. He started the year with the SEAT 2.0 TDI engine but switched to the SUNRED 1.6T for Brno onwards. He finished the season 5th in the standings with just one win in a year dominated by the Chevrolet RML team.

====Lukoil Racing (2012)====
In January 2012 it was confirmed that Tarquini would drive for Lukoil Racing in a SEAT León powered by the new SEAT Sport turbocharged engine. His teammate will once again be Aleksei Dudukalo. He started from pole position at the first race of the season in Italy but finished third behind Yvan Muller and Rob Huff in race one, he retired from the second race. Contact with Huff in race two in Portugal left him 19th with damage although no penalties were applied.

====Honda (2013–2015)====
In July 2012, it was confirmed that Tarquini would drive a factory supported Honda Civic run by the returning JAS Motorsport team, alongside Tiago Monteiro in 2013. He qualified fifth for the season opening Race of Italy but was given a five–place grid penalty for race one having tapped René Münnich into a spin during qualifying. He finished race one in fourth and race two in third. He gave the Honda team its first pole position in the WTCC at the Race of Morocco. He finished second in race one but retired from race two when he lost control over one of the kerbs and collided with Alex MacDowall.

====Lada (2016)====

In his last season of WTCC he moved to the uncompetitive Lada team where he was able to score 2 victories.

===WTCR===
====Hyundai (2018-2021)====
After spending the entire 2017 to develop the new Hyundai I30N, Tarquini raced in the new WTCR after the fusion between WTCC and International TCR. The 2018 saw him again protagonist and after an incredible battle with Muller he won his fourth title after BTCC, ETCC and WTCC. He announced his retirement from racing at the 2021 Race of Italy.

In a poll conducted by &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine in 2005, Tarquini was voted the 11th greatest touring car driver ever.

<text>Gastón Hugo Mazzacane (born 8 May 1975) is an Argentine racing driver. He participated in 21 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting in the 2000 Australian Grand Prix. His father, Hugo Mazzacane, named him after the late Argentine touring car racer Gastón Perkins.

Mazzacane has also raced in Turismo Carretera and was the first TC Pick Up champion in 2018.

==Racing career==
Mazzacane is often known as a &quot;pay driver&quot;. He began his Formula One career in 1999 as the test driver for Minardi. In late February , it was announced that he would be the teammate of Marc Gené in the race team. &quot;I intend to learn over the first half of the season and then I feel I will have the confidence to perform well,&quot; Mazzacane told the press at the launch of the Minardi M02. His debut year in Formula One began with a broken gearbox at his first race, the 2000 Australian Grand Prix, followed by a 10th place in Brazil. He went on to outqualify Gené at Imola, a feat he later accomplished twice more. The German Grand Prix was a relative high point for him; after outqualifying his teammate, he finished 11th. His highlight in the spotlights this season was on a damp Indianapolis track when he famously overtook Mika Häkkinen, who was struggling after an early gamble on dry tyres. After running up to third without stopping, he ran over his pitcrew and dropped out of the race later. Nevertheless, he finished 11 of the 17 races that year and ranked third among drivers with the most kilometres raced.

At the start of 2001, Mazzacane tested for Arrows, but finally settled into the Prost team, taking over the seat of the Sauber-bound Nick Heidfeld. He beat CART&#x27;s Oriol Servia for the Prost spot, and was announced as the second driver in January . However, the 2001 San Marino Grand Prix was his final Formula One race. Alain Prost fired him by using a performance clause in his contract, and the vacancy was filled by Luciano Burti, who had recently been sacked from Jaguar Racing.

He would be the last Argentinian to drive in Formula One until the 2024 Italian Grand Prix when Franco Colapinto drove for Williams.

Mazzacane signed a contract with the reformed DART team a/k/a Phoenix, which had plans to race in the season. However, it was not to be as the team was barred from racing.

He then went to the US and competed in the last half of the 2004 Champ Car season with the Dale Coyne Racing #19 car.

<text>Steven Earl Gaines (September 14, 1949 – October 20, 1977) was an American musician. Steve is widely considered to be the best guitarist in Lynyrd Skynyrd. He is best known as a guitarist and backing vocalist with rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1976 until his death in the October 1977 airplane crash that claimed other band members and crew. His older sister Cassie Gaines, a backup vocalist with the band, also died in the crash.

==Life and career==
Gaines was born in Miami, Oklahoma. When he was 15 years old, he saw the Beatles performing live in Kansas City. After being driven home from the concert, he pestered his father to buy him his first guitar. His band, Manalive, recorded at the famous Sun Records Studio in Memphis, Tennessee. In the 1970s, Steve played with bands ILMO Smokehouse from Quincy, Illinois, Detroit with Rusty Day (an offshoot of The Detroit Wheels) and Crawdad (a band that Steve had started around 1974). In 1975, he recorded several songs with Crawdad at Capricorn studios in Macon, Georgia which were released by MCA in 1988 as &quot;One in the Sun&quot; (when Lynyrd Skynyrd band began touring). This album is listed as his only official solo album. Steve has two other albums, which are known to be very rare CDs from Steve&#x27;s widow Teresa: &quot;I Know a Little&quot; (a collection of live recordings with Crawdad as well as Manalive) and &quot;Okie Special&quot; (a collection of live recordings with Crawdad as well as Detroit). Only 100 copies of each of the two CDs have been made.

In December 1975, Steve&#x27;s older sister, Cassie, became a member of Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s female backup singers, The Honkettes. The band had been seeking a replacement for Ed King, one of three lead guitarists in its lineup, since his departure in mid-1975. Cassie recommended Steve, and after initial reluctance the band allowed him to join them onstage for a song during a show at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri on May 11, 1976, Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; &quot;T-For Texas, (Blue Yodel #1)&quot;. Although the band couldn&#x27;t hear Steve&#x27;s playing onstage, soundman Kevin Elson was listening through headphones and told them that Steve was outstanding. They jammed with him informally a couple of times more, then invited him into the band just in time for the recording of Skynyrd&#x27;s live album &quot;One More from the Road&quot;. The first of three shows recorded for the album was Gaines&#x27; third gig with the band. Ed King and Steve Gaines were both born on September 14, 1949.

Gaines&#x27; guitar-picking and songwriting skills were a major revelation to the band, as demonstrated on his one studio album, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Street Survivors&quot;. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the vocal and instrumental skill of Skynyrd&#x27;s newest member, claiming that the band would &quot;all be in his shadow one day&quot;. Steve&#x27;s contributions included his co-lead vocal with Ronnie on the co-written &quot;You Got That Right&quot; (a solid hit single released after the plane crash) and the rousing guitar boogie &quot;I Know a Little&quot; which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd&#x27;s leader of Steve&#x27;s abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Steve delivering his self-penned bluesy &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Good Life&quot; – one of the few songs in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Van Zant.
On October 20, 1977, three days after &quot;Street Survivors&quot; was released (and five dates into the band&#x27;s most successful ticket sales tour yet), a plane carrying both musicians and crew between shows from Greenville, South Carolina to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, crashed outside of Gillsburg, Mississippi. The plane landed in a swampy area and crashed into trees, killing Gaines, Van Zant, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray.

Gaines was cremated and his ashes were buried in Orange Park, Florida in 1977, but were relocated to an undisclosed location after vandals broke into his and bandmate Ronnie Van Zant&#x27;s tombs on June 29, 2000. Their mausoleums remain as memorials for fans to visit. 10 years later, the new location of their interment was accidentally revealed by a Craigslist ad. A family selling two plots they decided not to retain, ran a Craigslist ad and stated the plots were in the Jacksonville Memory Gardens Cemetery in Orange Park, Florida, adjacent to Ronnie Van Zant&#x27;s tomb.

Gaines is the subject of the 2001 song &quot;Cassie&#x27;s Brother&quot; by rock band Drive-By Truckers.

Less than two years after the plane crash, Cassie LaRue Gaines, mother of Cassie and Steve, was killed in an automobile accident near the cemetery where her children were buried. She was buried near them.

<doc id="1219804" wikidata="Q4720318" url="?curid=1219804" title="Alexander Walkden, 1st Baron Walkden">
<text>Alexander George Walkden, 1st Baron Walkden (11 May 1873 – 25 April 1951) was a British trade union leader and Labour politician.

==Trade unionism==
In 1906 Walkden was appointed the fourth General Secretary of the Railway Clerks&#x27; Association (the modern &quot;Transport Salaried Staffs&#x27; Association&quot;) at a particularly important point in its history. His immediate predecessor, John Stopford Challener, had absconded with most of the union&#x27;s money—a crime which was only discovered after he committed suicide in Paris. Walkden was an extremely able administrator and socialist, who in his thirty years as general secretary built up the impoverished union into a respected organisation which was influential in both the Labour Party and the trade union movement. In his period of office he was also influential in the creation of the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation (ITF). At thirty years (1906–1936) he is the longest-serving general secretary in the history of the RCA/TSSA, his nearest rival being the fifteen years served by Richard Rosser between 1989 and 2004. When the union built its new headquarters building adjacent to London&#x27;s Euston railway station in the 1960s, it was named &quot;Walkden House&quot; in his honour.

==Political career==
Walkden unsuccessfully stood for Parliament as the Labour candidate in Wolverhampton West at the 1918 general election, at a by-election in 1922 and at the 1922 general election. He was unsuccessful again in Heywood and Radcliffe in 1924, but was elected at the 1929 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol South. Although seriously ill for much of the 1929–1931 Parliament, Walkden was active in pressing for legislation to create London Transport, a long-time policy of the union. The Labour government fell before the London Passenger Transport Act could be passed, and he lost his seat in the 1931 general election but as a union leader, he pressed the subsequent National Government to reintroduce the bill, which it did in 1932, and it came into effect in 1933. Walkden was re-elected for Bristol South at the 1935 general election, serving until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1945 general election. on 9 July 1945 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Walkden, of Great Bookham in the County of Surrey. He then served under Clement Attlee as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords) from 1945 until 1949.

==Personal life==
Lord Walkden died in April 1951, aged 77, when the barony became extinct.

<doc id="1219810" wikidata="Q914856" url="?curid=1219810" title="Historic preservation">
<text>Historic preservation (US), built heritage preservation or built heritage conservation (UK) is an endeavor that seeks to preserve, conserve and protect buildings, objects, landscapes or other artifacts of historical significance. It is a philosophical concept that became popular in the twentieth century, which maintains that cities as products of centuries&#x27; development should be obligated to protect their patrimonial legacy. The term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.

==Areas of professional, paid practice==
Paid work, performed by trained professionals, in historic preservation can be divided into the practice areas of regulatory compliance, architecture and construction, historic sites/museums, advocacy, and downtown revitalization/rejuvenation; each of these areas has a different set of expected skills, knowledge, and abilities.

===United States===
In the United States, about 70% of professional, paid practice in historic preservation is in the area of regulatory compliance, which is driven by laws, regulations, and guidelines promulgated at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, these include the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and associated regulations, such as Section 106 (54 USC 306108, formerly known as 36 CFR 800), National Register of Historic Places (54 USC 302101–302108), and the Secretary of the Interior&#x27;s Standards (36 CFR 67); many states have laws that reference these federal regulations or create parallel regulations, using federal regulatory language. At the local level, preservation laws and regulations are known as &quot;preservation ordinances&quot; and define the need for private property owners to seek a &quot;certificate of appropriateness&quot; when making modifications to existing buildings that are listed in a local historical register. Refer to the table, below, for the full breakdown of various practice areas in the United States.

===United Kingdom===
According to a 2008 survey conducted by the National Heritage Training Group, the size of the built heritage conservation sector, and how its various specializations break down, is not known.

==History==
=== France ===
In 1790, Aubin-Louis Millin submitted a report to the Constituent Assembly regarding the demolition of the Bastille, using the term &quot;monument historique&quot; (). The idea of preserving sites linked to the Ancien régime and earlier circulated as a result, and under impetus of Talleyrand, the Assembly, on the 13th of October, created the &quot;commission des monuments&quot; () whose function was to &quot;study the fate of monuments, arts, and sciences.&quot; The following year, Alexandre Lenoir was appointed to create the Musée des Monuments français (), which opened in 1795 and exhibited fragments of architecture Lenoir had saved and salvaged from destruction over the previous years. The museum was ultimately closed during the Restoration by Louis XVIII, and its collection was returned to the original owners and their families.

The vandalism and widespread destruction which accompanied the French Revolution had inspired several such responses, and the first known register of such buildings was an inventory of the castles begun by Louis XVI by the &quot;conseil des bâtiments civils&quot; (), which was completed in 1795. Between 1804 and 1834, several archaeological societies were formed, notably the &quot;Société des antiquaires de France&quot; in 1804 (originally the &quot;Académie celtique&quot;), the &quot;Société française d&#x27;archéologie&quot; in 1834, and the &quot;Comité des travaux historiques et scientifiques&quot; also in 1834.

In 1819, the Ministry of the Interior provided an allowance for &quot;monuments historiques&quot; for the first time, and, on 21 October 1830, François Guizot (then Minister of the Interior) proposed the creation of a post, the , to classify buildings and distribute funds for their preservation. This post was first assigned to Ludovic Vitet on 25 November 1830, and later to Prosper Mérimée on 27 May 1834. In 1837, Bachasson, in his capacity of Minister of the Interior, officially established the &quot;Commission des monuments historiques&quot; () to carry out the work of classification and producing an inventory, as well as distributing funding and training architects for restoration work (Eugène Viollet-le-Duc among them). The Commission published its first inventory in 1840, and subsequently continued its inventory work, as well as create visual records for any future restoration. To this end, it created the Mission Héliographique to photograph monuments in 1851. During this period, the combination of reluctance to understand the government&#x27;s prerogatives and the fact that the classification of private property required the owners&#x27; consent resulted in the gradual decrease in the number of registered monuments.

On 2 May 1887, a law was passed establishing procedures for the classification of historic monuments as well as establish provisions for a body of for their upkeep. In 1906, French law laid down principles of classification of natural sites. Under the 1905 Law of Separation of Church and State, local communities and the government were entrusted with the care and upkeep of religious buildings, however, this led to refusal to care for buildings not of &quot;national interest&quot; by some and the auctioning off of heritage by others. Per consequence, on 13 December 1913, a law was passed which widened the field of protection for classified monuments, including changing &quot;national interest&quot; to &quot;public interest&quot; and allowing the classification of private property without the consent of the owner. During the 1920s and 1930s, classification further opened up to private property; additionally, monuments post-dating the Ancien régime began to be classified. In 1925, a second order of classification was introduced: &quot;inscription à l&#x27;inventaire supplémentaire des monuments historiques&quot; ().

In 1930, the classifications were renamed &quot;classé&quot; and &quot;inscrit&quot; () and classification was allowed to include the land immediately surrounding a classified building. During the Nazi Occupation, numerous classifications were made both in order to prevent destruction of monuments and to provide some protection from compulsory labour.

===The United Kingdom===
In England, antiquarian interests were a familiar gentleman&#x27;s pursuit since the mid 17th century, developing in tandem with the rise in scientific curiosity. Fellows of the Royal Society were often also Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries.

Many historic sites were damaged as the railways began to spread across the UK, these sites included Trinity Hospital and its church in Edinburgh, Furness Abbey, Berwick and Northampton Castle, as well as the ancient walls of York, Chester and Newcastle. In 1833 Berkhamsted Castle became the first historic site in England to be officially protected by statute, under the London and Birmingham Railway Acts of 18331837, though the new railway line in 1834 did demolish the castle&#x27;s gatehouse and outer earthworks to the south.

In 1847 the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust was formed by a local act of Parliament, the Shakespeare Birthplace, &amp;c., Trust Act 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. iii), to prevent the Stratford property&#x27;s sale to American showman P. T. Barnum.

Another early preservation event also occurred at Berkhamsted. In 1866, Lord Brownlow who lived at Ashridge House, tried to enclose the adjoining Berkhamsted Common with steel fences in an attempt to claim it as part of his estate. In England from early Anglo-Saxon times, Common land was an area of land which the local community could use as a resource. Across England between 1660 and 1845, 7 million acres of Common land had been enclosed by private land owners by application to parliament. On the night of 6 March 1866, Augustus Smith MP led gangs of local folk and hired men from London&#x27;s East End in direct action to break the enclosure fences and protect Berkhamsted Common for the people of Berkhamsted in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common. In 1870, Sir Robert Hunter (later co-founder of the National Trust in 1895) and the Commons Preservation Society succeed in legal action that ensured protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.

By the mid 19th century, much of Britain&#x27;s unprotected cultural heritage was being slowly destroyed. Even well-meaning archaeologists like William Greenwell excavated sites with virtually no attempt at their preservation, Stonehenge came under increasing threat by the 1870s. Tourists were chipping off parts of the stones or carving their initials into the rock. The private owners of the monument decided to sell the land to the London and South-Western Railway who stated that the monument was &quot;not the slightest use to anyone now&quot;. John Lubbock, an MP and botanist emerged as the champion of the country&#x27;s national heritage. In 1872 he personally bought private land that housed ancient monuments in Avebury, Silbury Hill and elsewhere, from the owners who were threatening to have them cleared away to make room for housing. Soon, he began campaigning in Parliament for legislation to protect monuments from destruction. This finally led to the legislative milestone under the Liberal government of William Gladstone of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. The first government appointed inspector for this job was the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers. This legislation was regarded by conservative political elements as a grave assault on the individual rights of property of the owner, and consequently, the inspector only had the power to identify endangered landmarks and offer to purchase them from the owner with his consent. The Act only covered ancient monuments and explicitly did not cover historic buildings or structures. In 1877 the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings was founded by the Arts and Crafts designer William Morris to prevent the destruction of historic buildings, followed by the National Trust in 1895 that bought estates from their owners for preservation.

The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 had only given legal protection to prehistoric sites, such as ancient tumuli. The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 took this further by empowering the government&#x27;s Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. Further updates were made in 1910.
Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, a medieval manor house had been put up for sale in 1910 with its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, still intact. However, when an American bought the house they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. The former viceroy of India, George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, was outraged at this cultural destruction and stepped in to buy back the castle and reinstall the fireplaces. After a nationwide hunt for them they were finally found in London and returned. He restored the castle and left it to the National Trust on his death in 1925. His experience at Tattershall influenced Lord Curzon to push for tougher heritage protection laws in Britain, which saw passage as the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913.

The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term &quot;monument&quot; was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.

====The National Trust====
The National Trust was founded in 1894 by Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter, and Hardwicke Canon Rawnsley as the first organisation of its type in the world. Its formal purpose is: The preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and tenements (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest and, as regards lands, for the preservation of their natural aspect, features and animal and plant life. Also the preservation of furniture, pictures and chattels of any description having national and historic or artistic interest.

In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings. Its first acquisition was Dinas Oleu, a piece of land on the clifftop above Barmouth in Wales, donated in 1895. Two other sites acquired by the Trust in its early years later became nature reserves: Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire and Blakeney Point in Norfolk. White Barrow on Salisbury Plain was the Trust&#x27;s first archaeological monument.White Barrow on Salisbury Plain was the Trust&#x27;s first archaeological monument, purchased in 1909 for £60. The focus on country houses and gardens, which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties, came about in the mid 20th century, when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them.

====English Heritage====
English Heritage formed in 1983, is a registered charity that looks after the National Heritage Collection in England. This comprises over 400 of England&#x27;s historic buildings, monuments and sites spanning more than 5,000 years of history. Within its portfolio are Stonehenge, Dover Castle, Tintagel Castle and the best preserved parts of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

Originally English Heritage was the operating name of an executive non-departmental public body of the British Government, officially titled the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England, that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties. It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999 the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record (England), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England&#x27;s historic environment. On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: Historic England, which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new English Heritage Trust, a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo. The British government gave the new charity an £80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state.

The Town and Country Planning Acts of 1944 and 1947 established the listing of buildings of special architectural or historic interest; by 2017 there were 377,700 listed buildings on the National Heritage List for England, which is maintained by Historic England.

====National Parks====

=== The Netherlands ===
Victor de Stuers is widely considered the man who started historic preservation in the Netherlands. In 1875 the first national department for conservation was established and de Stuers was appointed as the first legal secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs as chief of the brand new Department of Arts and Sciences. He was the driving force behind &quot;Monumentenzorg&quot; (Foundation for Historic Preservation), helped found the &quot;Rijksmuseum&quot; (National Museum) and the &quot;Rijksarchief&quot; (National Archives).

However, it was not until the 20th century that there was national legislation on historic preservation. In 1961 the &quot;Monumentenwet&quot; (&quot;Monuments Act&quot;) was passed. It defined that any physical building or space that was at least fifty years old and &quot;which are of general interest because of their beauty, their meaning to science or their social value&quot; and must thus be preserved. In 1988 this Act was replaced by the &quot;Monumentenwet 1988&quot; (&quot;Monuments Act 1988&quot;) and in 2015 by the &quot;Erfgoedwet&quot; (&quot;Heritage Law&quot;).

In 1973, the NGO &quot;Monumentenwacht&quot; (&quot;Monument Watch&quot;) was founded with the purpose of providing preventative measures of maintenance for historic buildings. As the majority of the historic preservation programs in the Netherlands, this program is decentralized, managed on the provincial level. Owners of heritage buildings can subscribe to the services of Monumentenwacht and receive regular visits for inspection. The costs are covered through a combination of national and provincial subsidies.

A special kind of preservation that takes place in the Netherlands is the preservation of maritime heritage. Maritime trade was the Dutch specialty which shaped much of their culture and as a country that is 50% under sea level the Dutch history is closely intertwined with water. There are maritime museums in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam that tell the story of the Dutch maritime heritage, but there is not much legal documentation on how to preserve it. For example, according to Sarah Dromgoole, shipwrecks from The Dutch East India Company are found all around the world, which are still property of the Netherlands, but the Dutch government rarely takes responsibility for this property that is found outside of their territory.

===The United States===
In the United States one of the first historic preservation efforts was the Washington&#x27;s Headquarters State Historic Site, in Newburgh, New York. This property has the distinction of being the first-ever property designated and operated as a historic site by a U.S. state, having been so since 1850.

Another early historic preservation undertaking was that of George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon in 1858. Founded in 1889, the Richmond, Virginia-based Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) was the United States&#x27; first statewide historic preservation group. The American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society was formed in 1895 as the first American organization of its kind in the United States that did not limit its activities to a single historic place or object. The Society operated as a national organization to: protect the natural scenery and the preservation of historic landmarks; to preserve landmarks and records of the past or present; to erect memorials and promote appreciation of the scenic beauty of America.

Charles E. Peterson was an influential figure in the mid-20th century establishing the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), advising on the establishment of Independence National Historical Park, helping with the first graduate degree program in historic preservation in the United States at Columbia University, and author.

The architectural firm of Simons &amp; Lapham (Albert Simons and Samuel Lapham) was an influential supporter of the nation&#x27;s first historic preservation ordinance in Charleston, South Carolina in 1930, affording that city a regulatory means by which to prevent the destruction of its historic building stock. In 1925, efforts to preserve the historic buildings of the French Quarter in New Orleans led to the creation of the Vieux Carré Commission and later, to the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.

The US National Trust for Historic Preservation, another privately funded non-profit organization, began in 1949 with a handful of structures and has developed goals that provide &quot;leadership, education, advocacy, and resources to save America&#x27;s diverse historic places and revitalize our communities&quot; according to the Trust&#x27;s mission statement. In 1951 the Trust assumed responsibility for its first museum property, Woodlawn Plantation in northern Virginia. Twenty-eight sites in all have subsequently become part of the National Trust, representing the cultural diversity of American history. In New York City, the destruction of Pennsylvania Station in 1964 shocked many nationwide into supporting preservation. The 1960s proved advantageous with new laws and international agreements extending preservation &quot;from ancient monuments to whole districts and buildings a few decades old.&quot; On an international level, the New York-based World Monuments Fund was founded in 1965 to preserve historic sites all over the world.

Under the direction of James Marston Fitch, the first advanced-degree historic preservation program began at Columbia University in 1964. It became the model on which most other graduate historic preservation programs were created. Many other programs were to follow before 1980: M.A. in Preservation Planning from Cornell (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation from the University of Vermont (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation Studies from Boston University (1976); M.S. in Historic Preservation from Eastern Michigan University (1979) and M.F.A. in Historic Preservation was one of the original programs at Savannah College of Art &amp; Design. James Marston Fitch also offered guidance and support towards the founding of the Master of Preservation Studies Degree within the Tulane School of Architecture in 1996. The M.Sc. in Building Conservation degree program is offered by the School of Architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. In 2005, Clemson University and the College of Charleston created an M.S. degree program based in Charleston, SC. The first undergraduate programs (B.A.) appeared in 1977 from Goucher College and Roger Williams University (then called Roger Williams College), followed by Mary Washington College in 1979. there were more than fifty historic preservation programs offering certificates, associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s degrees in the United States. Under the direction of Jorge Otero-Pailos, the first PhD in Historic Preservation in the United States was founded at Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation in 2018.

====National Register of Historic Places====

====National Historic Landmark====
====Historic districts====
A historic district in the United States is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.

The U.S. federal government designates historic districts through the U.S. Department of Interior, under the auspices of the National Park Service. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Historic districts allows rural areas to preserve their characters through historic preservation programs. These include &quot;Main Street&quot; programs that can be used to redevelop rural downtowns. Using historic preservation programs as an economic development tool for local governments in rural areas has enabled some of those areas to take advantage of their history and develop a tourism market that in turn provides funds for maintaining an economic stability that these areas would not have seen otherwise.

A similar concept exists in the United Kingdom: a Conservation area is designated in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 in order to protect a zone in which there are buildings of architectural or cultural heritage interest.

====National Parks====
The Department of the Interior designated several areas of Morristown, New Jersey as the first historic park in the United States national park system. It became designated as the Morristown National Historical Park. The community had permanent settlements that date to 1715, is termed the military capital of the American Revolution, and contains many designations of sites and locations. The park includes three major sites in Morristown.

In the United Kingdom, James Bryce the ambassador to the US praised the system of National Parks and campaigned to have them introduced in Great Britain. Little came of it until mounting public pressure during the early 20th century from the Ramblers&#x27; Association and other groups led to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.

===Australia===
All of Australia&#x27;s major cities have had historic or heritage preservation establishments and legislation in place since the mid to late 1970s, though destruction or outright demolition of historic buildings continues in most Australian cities to this day, subject to council or planning approval, particularly outside of the city centres in historic neighbourhoods. Melbourne was founded in 1835 and grew enormously in wealth and prosperity following the 1850s gold rush, which resulted in a construction boom: large edifices were erected to serve as public buildings such as libraries, court houses, schools, churches, and offices. This led to a period where Melbourne became known as &quot;Marvellous Melbourne&quot;, boasting the largest collection of Victorian architecture outside of England. However, in the years that followed, and as the thousands of Australian soldiers arrived back from the battlefields following the end of World War I there emerged a sense of renewed pride and a willingness to forget the dark days of war and distance Australian from its Victorian origins, considered &quot;unfashionable&quot; or &quot;outdated&quot; by some. The Council of the City of Melbourne was no doubt buoyed by this new nationalistic pride and put in place schemes to modernize the city which included increasing the building height limit and removing some of the Victorian era cast ironwork.
In the years leading up to World War II the Whelan the Wrecker firm had already pulled down thousands of structures in both the city and surrounding suburbs, as Melbourne became particularly conscious of International Modernism. James Paul Whelan&#x27;s obituary of 1938 suggests that his company had the task of demolishing up to 98% of buildings marked for removal in the city alone. The rise of this International Modernism saw a new approach that valued replacing older, elaborate inefficient buildings with new ones. An early example of this was a City of Melbourne by-law in 1954 that mandated the demolition of all posted cast-iron verandas, thought to be dangerous as well as old fashioned, in order to &#x27;clean up&#x27; the city before the 1956 Summer Olympics.

Sydney (Australia&#x27;s oldest city) was also affected by the International Modernism period and also suffered an extensive loss of its Victorian architecture, something that subsisted well into the 1980s. From the 1950s onwards, many of Sydney&#x27;s handsome sandstone and masonry buildings were wiped away by architects and developers who built &quot;brown concrete monstrosities&quot; in their place. The 1980s saw &quot;uncomfortable pastiches of facades with no coherence and little artistic merit&quot;. Green bans in Australian cities such as Sydney and Melbourne came into effect in the 1970s and the Australian Heritage Commission (AHS), was established by the Federal Government in 1975 by the &quot;Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975&quot; as the first body to manage natural and cultural heritage in Australia until its demise in 2004. It was responsible for the Register of the National Estate. The Australian National Heritage List was established in 2003. Controversy arose in 2016 in Melbourne after the historic Corkman Irish Pub was illegally demolished overnight, resulting in the State Planning Minister pursuing an order (via the Victorian Administrative Appeals Tribunal) for the two-story pub to be rebuilt. The site owners were fined AUD$1.325 million after pleading guilty to the process.

In the city of Adelaide, large public protests erupted in the 1980s regarding the 1983 campaign to save the Aurora Hotel in Hindmarsh Square, which had been recommended for listing on the city heritage register but refused because the site was to be redeveloped. The protest led to the emergence of Aurora Heritage Action, Inc. (AHA), which became the most vocal heritage lobby group in Adelaide during the decade, often working in cooperation with residents&#x27; associations and later the National Trust. While governments were urged to protect the traditional character of Adelaide, capital became more widely available for development. The large increase in property development from 1987 increased opposition to further demolition of Adelaide&#x27;s historic buildings. Local councils and lobbyists alike aimed to expand the horizon of heritage to protect historic precincts across the city, even if buildings within those precincts did not warrant heritage listing. The Bannon government slowly responded to public demand and introduced historic (conservation) zones through a revision to the Planning Act (1982) in 1989. Not regulated by the Planning Act, the City of Adelaide endeavoured to create on a similar scheme, which became known as the townscape initiative, facilitating one of the most destructive political debates in the council&#x27;s history.

===Canada===

In Canada, the phrase &quot;heritage preservation&quot; is sometimes seen as a specific approach to the treatment of historic places and sites, rather than a general concept of conservation. &quot;Conservation&quot; is taken as the more general term, referring to all actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life.

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the federal government, the provincial government, or a municipal government.
The Heritage Canada Foundation acts as Canada&#x27;s lead advocacy organization for heritage buildings and landscapes.
=== Israel ===
In Israel, there are currently two laws concerning historic preservation, Antiquities Law of the State of Israel (1978) and Planning and Building Law (1965). Both laws were adapted from the British law that was implemented during the British Mandate of Palestine.

However, these laws are not comprehensive and limited in scope: the Antiquities Law only applies itself to buildings or artifacts dated before 1700 BC. So while efforts discovering and protecting anything older than 1700 BC are well protected, anything from later historical periods is not under the protection of this law. The Planning and Building Law discusses the overall management and regulation of land use in Israel. It has been through several changes and amendments specifically regarding preservation, but over the years it hasn&#x27;t been enforced and many historical sites were destroyed, as the state was prioritizing developmental and economic interests.

During the 1960s, the issue of preservation was gaining public awareness, and as a response to the destruction of Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium (one of the first educational institutions in Israel) in 1959, a wave of shock and anger led to extensive public debate.

In 1984, The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was established, at the recommendation of the Knesset and the Committee of Education. Its aims include locating remains of historic settlements, protect and conserve them as well as developing conservation principles that are specific to Israel&#x27;s historic situations and are aligned with international standards. The council used to operate under the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel but in 2008 registers as an independent non-profit. Today, it is the organization responsible for the most historical preservation endeavors as well as efforts to add amendments to existing laws to provide a comprehensive and effective framework for preservation in Israel.

A different, separate effort in preservation comes from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The IDF surveyed 94 military bases and found that about 80 of them include sites worth preserving, and for each of these bases there is a preservation plan. The IDF is working towards maintaining these building as well as communicating their value to the soldiers in these bases. Buildings include Knights Templar sites, old military bases used by the British or German or buildings from the Ottoman period.

=== North Macedonia ===
In North Macedonia, historic preservation falls under the overarching category of cultural heritage preservation according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage (Закон за заштита на културното наследство). According to this law, which the Macedonian Parliament approved in March 2004, there are three types of cultural heritage: immovable, movable, and intangible. Historical preservation is represented by the protection of monuments and monumental entireties under immovable cultural heritage, and historical items under movable cultural heritage.

Although this law was the first nationwide establishment of regulations for historic preservation since North Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, several organizations throughout the 20th century have encompassed efforts of historic preservation.

The &quot;Central office for protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia&quot; has existed since 1949. In 1960, the Central Office was renamed to &quot;National office for protection of cultural monuments&quot;, and granted the status of an independent cultural institution, with authority to execute activities of historic preservation. After the establishment of the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage in 2004, the Ministry of Culture once again renamed the office to &quot;National center for conservation&quot; and narrowed down its responsibilities to dealing solely with preservation of immovable cultural heritage.

Other organizations which have contributed to the efforts of historic preservation are the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS and the NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum-Ohrid.

The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) established their branch in North Macedonia in 1995 through the initiative of 43 conservationists from Macedonia. The guiding principles of the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS are raising the national consciousness about the importance of historic and cultural heritage, decentralization of the discourse about heritage, and effective monitoring of the status of cultural and historic heritage in the country.

The NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum – Ohrid is the second oldest institutions for historical preservation established in 1952. In 1956 the institute was granted authority to protect movable and immovable cultural and historic heritage in the Ohrid region. The institute has since executed numerous efforts for historic preservation, most notably aiding the recognition of the city of Ohrid as a UNESCO site of cultural heritage in 1979.

Today, the main authority for historic preservation is the Cultural Heritage Protection Office (Управа за заштита на културно наследство). The Office is an independent governmental organization under the Ministry of Culture, divided into three departments:
#Identification, Protection and Use of Cultural Heritage
#Prevention and Supervision
#Documentation, International Cooperation and Administrative Affairs

== Policy-making institutions ==
=== UNESCO (international) ===

According to UNESCO&#x27;s 1972 World Heritage Convention, landscapes and sites of outstanding universal value can be designated as World Heritage Sites. The World Heritage Convention encompasses historic preservation under the category of &quot;cultural heritage&quot;. According to Article 1 of the convention, monuments, groups of buildings, and sites &quot;which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science&quot; are to be designated cultural heritage.

A requirement of such designation is that the designating nation has appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures in place to identify, protect, conserve, present, and rehabilitate world heritage sites. However, according to Article 6 of the convention, while sovereignty of the State where the site is located is not to be compromised, the State acknowledges that protection of heritage sites is a duty of the entire international community.

The World Heritage convention&#x27;s counterpart, The World Heritage Committee, is the body responsible for the practical implementation of the convention as well as managing and deciding how to use the World Heritage Fund. The committee also gets to have the final say when determining whether a property will be included in the World Heritage List.

The Committee meets once a year and includes representatives from 21 states that are part of the States Parties. Yearly reports are available to the public on the World Heritage website and include outlines of decisions made, outcomes, working documents and various reports.

International partner of UNESCO is Blue Shield International. From a national and international perspective, there are many cooperations with Blue Shield organizations and with United Nations peacekeeping to ensure the sustainable existence of cultural assets.

Unique to the United States is the requirement in federal law, stipulated in the amended National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, that all owners of property that would be designated as World Heritage must provide consent to this treatment. Functionally, this is the reason why, out of all signatories to the World Heritage Convention, the US has no urban World Heritage Sites because it is impossible to gain 100% owner consent for sites with multiple, privately owned properties. The majority of World Heritage sites in the US is owned by the federal government.

=== International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) (international) ===
The International Council on Monuments and Sites, through the creation of international preservation/conservation doctrine, promulgates international guidelines for the treatment of historic buildings and places.

=== National Park Service (US) ===
Under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and, as amended), the United States Secretary of the Interior is required to create and maintain a National Register of Historic Places; support, through grants and training, state historic preservation offices; facilitate the implementation of the federal historic rehabilitation tax credit; implement the World Heritage Convention; and provide training and education in historic preservation. The Secretary of the Interior delegated all of these responsibilities to the National Park Service. The National Park Service is responsible for creating and implementing most of federal preservation policy in the US, including the National Register, Secretary of the Interior&#x27;s Standards, and training qualifications for professionals.

=== Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) (US) ===
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) also created a new federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which consists of a chair and members of the public appointed by the US president. Other members of the ACHP are statutorily appointed. The ACHP&#x27;s mission, per the NHPA is to &quot;promote the preservation, enhancement, and sustainable use of our nation&#x27;s diverse historic resources, and advise the President and the Congress on national historic preservation policy.&quot; The ACHP is also responsible for implementing the regulations for Section 106 review (i.e., &quot;environmental review&quot;) under the NHPA.

=== Historic England (UK) ===
Historic England is an executive non-departmental public body of the British Government sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. It is tasked with protecting the historic environment of England by preserving and listing historic buildings, scheduling ancient monuments, registering historic Parks and Gardens and by advising central and local government.

=== Parks Canada (Canada) ===
Parks Canada, which is part of the Government of Canada, manages the country&#x27;s 48 National Parks, three National Marine Conservation Areas, 172 National Historic Sites, one National Urban Park, and one National Landmark. Parks Canada is mandated to &quot;protect and present nationally significant examples of Canada&#x27;s natural and cultural heritage, and foster public understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment in ways that ensure their ecological and commemorative integrity for present and future generations&quot;.

== Challenges ==

=== Natural conditions and aging ===

As a preserved site ages, various natural processes and risks will have their impact on its structures. Many of those have been addressed through history in the traditional construction and preservation methods. Nevertheless, weathering and wearing and other processes can threaten the building over time and should therefore be addressed through monitoring, preventive action and, when necessary, repairs.

Such processes and risks include those stemming from natural conditions (e.g. humidity changes, extreme temperatures, high winds, soil characteristics and ground water), decay of materials (e.g. vegetation and insects, erosion, weathering, structural settling) and natural hazards (e.g. ground movements, landslides, earthquakes and subsidence, flooding, fires and storms). Countermeasures include applying early warning and monitoring technologies and methods, using traditional and modern preventive solutions on site, adequate maintenance with proper skills and disaster preparedness and mitigation measures. Some practical examples include monitoring the building with fire alarm and suppression systems, applying lightning protection systems, following weather reports and preparing for extreme weather conditions, regular inspections and maintenance of building structures, humidity and temperature control with appropriate HVAC systems, and monitoring ground movements, underground humidity and the condition of foundations with ground penetrating radar or electrical resistivity tomography.

=== Demographics of paid professionals, volunteers, and students in the field ===
The historic preservation field is one of the least diverse, in terms of race and ethnicity, of any of the built environment professions. 99% of preservation practitioners are white; 85% of students in higher education historic preservation programs identify as white/Non-Hispanic, 1.0% identify as American Indian, 2.3% identify as Asian, 2.8% identify as African American, and 6.4% identify as Hispanic or Latino; there are no African American people, indigenous people, and essentially no people of color, who are tenured or tenure track faculty with at least a 50% teaching appointment in historic preservation degree programs (as of 2018); and most people who volunteer in preservation commissions are white.

=== Racial, ethnic, and gender bias in paid historic preservation practice ===
Many historic preservation and cultural resource management scholars, such as Erica Avrami, Sara Bronin, Gail Dubrow, Jamesha Gibson, Ned Kaufman, Thomas King, Michelle Magalong, Kenyatta McLean, Sharon Milholland, Andrea Roberts, and Jeremy Wells, have presented evidence that a significant part of historic preservation practice remains biased toward people who identify as white, male, non-Latino, and who have wealth. This bias is also ingrained in the doctrine, laws, regulations, and guidelines that drive about three-quarters of the paid practice in the field.

=== Lack of research that addresses the practice of historic preservation ===
In the United States, unlike other built environment disciplines (i.e., architecture, planning, interior design, landscape architecture), there is no tradition of intra-disciplinary research in the field that specifically addresses the practice of historic preservation, especially in relation to policy, which is its largest driver of work. Most research by preservation scholars addresses architectural history, but fails to address preservation policy, generally, including diversity, inclusion, equity, and social justice as well as topics related to community engagement and planning. Noted historic preservation scholar and exception to this rule, Ned Kaufman, refers to this phenomenon as preservation&#x27;s &quot;resistance to research&quot; in relation to the field&#x27;s inability to reflect on itself in terms of failures and successes:

As of 2022, in the US, there has never been a research center, research funding (government, foundation, or otherwise), or program, of any kind, that specifically attempts to provide answers as to the effectiveness of existing preservation policies, unintended impacts of preservation policies, and possible policy alternatives. Some scholars believe that the lack of intra-disciplinary historic preservation research is due to an anti-intellectual bias in the field that privileges exigency and physical interventions over scholarly reflection.

=== Climate change ===
Historic preservation assumes that it is possible to control the physical reality of a building or place through continual interventions in order to sustain the material, form, and meaning associated with such places. Climate change, especially in relation to sea level rise and associated weather events (e.g., hurricanes) threatens many historic buildings and places. In many cases, buildings cannot be saved in place due to these issues; preservation doctrine and, in some cases, regulations, prevents moving buildings to higher ground without an associated loss of historical integrity (or historical authenticity), which present an irreconcilable conundrum that the field has yet to resolve.

=== People-centered preservation ===
In the early 2000s, a series of publications on &quot;values-centered&quot; preservation by the Getty Conservation Institute helped to catalyze a scholarly debate on the underlying values that drive the historic preservation enterprise, especially in relation to the public and policy (e.g., laws, regulations, guidelines). Values-centered preservation was, in turn, preceded by earlier discussions in archaeology, in the 1990s, on the need to move from processual archaeology to postprocessual archaeology. What both of these movements advocate is a move from positivism and scientism in the practice of identifying, interpreting, and preserving/conserving movable and immovable heritage toward more emancipatory ontological orientations centered in the social sciences. People-centered preservation embraces the idea that the values and meanings held by the public for their own heritage, as a form of local knowledge, has as much significance as the values and meanings held by conventionally trained experts, such as architectural historians and archaeologists. People-centered preservation embraces the concept of the &quot;Authorized Heritage Discourse&quot; (AHD), established by Laurajane Smith in her book, &quot;Uses of Heritage.&quot; The AHD describes a system of communication used in built heritage practice and policy in which &quot;the proper care of heritage, and its associated values, lies with the experts, as it is only they who have the abilities, knowledge and understanding to identify the innate value and knowledge contained at and within historically important sites and places.&quot; The AHD forms the core of preservation policy created and sustained by local, state, and federal government.

Many of the concepts inherent in people-centered preservation align with the need to address deficits in diversity, inclusion, equity, and justice in policy and practice.

While the US National Trust for Historic Preservation has publicly embraced people-centered preservation, in the United States, no local, state, or federal agency has issued any publications, guidance, or recommendations related to people-centered preservation and there have been no policy changes. In the UK, however, in 2000, the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions published &quot;The Power of Place,&quot; which began to open policy discussions around values-based preservation and the introduction of social science concepts in built heritage conservation practice. This was followed by &quot;Heritage Protection for the 21st Century,&quot; published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which continued to refine policy reform arguments in the treatment of the historic environment in the UK. These publications, and the resulting public debate, did result in some policy changes that the UK government made to move practice related to the conservation of the historic environment toward a people-centered orientation.

=== Other challenges ===
Although preservation efforts can have benefits for the owners of historical buildings, such as tax cuts and subsidies, there are also drawbacks.

One such drawback is that after a neighborhood has been designated to be historically preserved, there is less construction. On the long term this can affect the value of property and investment in housing, both in the neighborhood itself and the neighborhoods directly surrounding it.

A second concern that has been raised is that buildings that need to be historically preserved are sometimes still inhabited. In some cases their inability to make changes to the building can lead to dangerous or unhealthy situations for residents.

It is not true that nothing could be changed or renovated, but the owner of the building would need to ask permission at the appropriate preservation society, slowing the process down severely. The exact policies are country dependent. Local historical and political realities need to be considered to preserve heritage.

Historic objects in galleries, museums and archives face the challenge from fine particulates representing an aesthetic issue and an agent of chemical degradation.

<text>Judas, My Brother: The Story of the Thirteenth Disciple is a 1968 historical novel by Frank Yerby, published by Dial Press. The novel provides a narrative attempting a demythologized account of the events surrounding the life of Jesus and the origin of Christianity.

==Plot introduction==
Written from the viewpoint of Nathan (&#x27;the Thirteenth Disciple&#x27;), the heavily footnoted book presents an adventure and romance storyline against the backdrop of the 1st century Roman Empire. Nathan&#x27;s travels lead him to Rome to fight as a retiarius, and on his return to Palestine to become involved with the Apostles, the Zealots and the Essenes. He loves Shelomith (the disciple Salome, depicted in the novel as a prostitute), who does not return his affections due to her unrequited love for Yeshua (Jesus).

==Main themes==
This story is simultaneously used as a vehicle for Yerby&#x27;s examination of the historical personalities and Christian beliefs through the ideas of critical theological writings. The book is written from a strongly skeptical viewpoint: For miracles he offers alternative physical explanations, such as mistaken identity, discrepancies in traditional Jewish and Essene calendars, and other explanations of varying plausibility. On the frontispiece, Yerby warns &quot;those emotionally dependent upon the Christian Religion&quot; to read no further. The sleeve notes continue:

:&quot; This novel touches on only two issues which, in a certain sense, might be called controversial: whether any man truly has the right to believe fanciful and childish nonsense; and whether any organization has the right to impose, by almost imperial fiat, belief in things that simply are not so. To me, irrationality is dangerous; perhaps the most dangerous force stalking through the world today. This novel, then, is one man&#x27;s plea for an ecumenicism broad enough to include reasonable men; and his effort to defend his modest intellect from intolerable insult&quot;,

Though Yerby is skeptical of Biblical accounts of supernatural &#x27;miracles&#x27;, he presents the character &#x27;Yeshua&#x27; as a man of strong moral character, deep compassion and keen insight into human nature, with a remarkable ability to inspire loyalty in his followers. Nathan finally concludes that the true miracle of Christianity is that a man could inspire such love in his disciples that they refuse to let him die; by sheer force of love they resurrect Him in their minds because they cannot live on without him.

Faced with this realization, Nathan becomes himself a disciple and devotes his life and wealth to the propagation of his new faith.

<text>John W. Dower (born June 21, 1938, in Providence, Rhode Island) is an American author and historian. His 1999 book &quot;Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II&quot; won the U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction, the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, the Bancroft Prize, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize, the Mark Lynton History Prize, and the John K. Fairbank Prize of the American Historical Association.

== Career ==
Dower earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in American Studies from Amherst College in 1959, and a PhD in History and Far Eastern Languages from Harvard University in 1972, where he studied under Albert M. Craig. He expanded his doctoral dissertation, a biography of former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, into the book &quot;Empire and Aftermath&quot;. His other books include a selection of writings by E. Herbert Norman and a study of mutual images during World War II entitled &quot;War Without Mercy&quot;.

Dower was the executive producer of the Academy Award-nominated documentary &quot;&quot;, and was a member of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, sitting on the editorial board of its journal with Noam Chomsky, and Herbert Bix. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the University of California, San Diego, and is a Ford International Professor of History, Emeritus, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

===Visualizing Cultures===

&quot;Visualizing Cultures&quot;, a course that Dower has taught at MIT since 2003, with Shigeru Miyagawa, discusses how images shape American and Japanese societies. The Visualizing Cultures website features some 18 scholars in over 40 units based on digitized image sets from the visual record. The project was recognized by MIT with the &quot;Class of 1960 Innovation in Education Award&quot; in 2004 and in 2005, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected VC for inclusion on &quot;EDSITEment&quot; as an online resource for education in the humanities. The curriculum on the website for the Canton Trade unit won the 2011 &quot;Franklin R. Buchanan prize from the Association of Asian Studies for best curricular materials concerning Asia.&quot;

The first Visualizing Cultures unit, &quot;Black Ships &amp; Samurai,&quot; written by John Dower, juxtaposed the visual record from the two sides of the 1853–1854 encounter when Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States arrived in Japan aboard the &quot;Black Ships&quot; (steam powered gunboats) to force that long-secluded country to open its borders to the outside world.

In April 2006, the OpenCourseWare website of &quot;Visualizing Cultures&quot; was announced on the main page of the MIT website, causing a stir among some Chinese students at MIT that found the material offensive. The material included woodblock prints produced in Japan as propaganda during the Chinese-Japanese War of 1894–1895 that portrayed Japanese soldiers beheading &quot;violent Chinese soldiers.&quot; The Japanese-born Miyagawa received death threats. In response, the authors temporarily removed the course from OpenCourseWare and released a statement, as did the MIT Administration. After a week, the course authors agreed to include additional context in controversial sections, and put the course back online.

<doc id="1219818" wikidata="Q213434" url="?curid=1219818" title="Samogitian language">
<text>Samogitian ( or sometimes , or ; ), often considered a dialect of Lithuanian, is an Eastern Baltic language spoken primarily in Samogitia. 

It has preserved many features of the extinct Curonian language, such as specific phonological traits and vocabulary. Samogitian differs significantly from standard Lithuanian in phonetics, morphology, syntax, and lexis, with unique archaic features not found in other Lithuanian dialects. This difference often causes speakers of Aukštaitian dialects to not be able to understand speakers of Samogitian. The use of Samogitian is currently in decline, with limited presence in media and education. Efforts are being made to preserve the language, including local initiatives and cultural societies.

== History ==

The Samogitian language, heavily influenced by Curonian, originated from the East Baltic proto-Samogitian dialect which was close to Aukštaitian dialects.

During the 5th century, Proto-Samogitians migrated from the lowlands of central Lithuania, near Kaunas, into the Dubysa and Jūra basins, as well as into the Samogitian Upland. They displaced or assimilated the local, Curonian-speaking Baltic populations. Further north, they displaced or assimilated the indigenous Semigallian-speaking peoples. Assimilation of Curonians and Semigallians gave birth to the three Samogitian subdialects.

In the 13th century, Žemaitija became a part of the Baltic confederation called Lietuva (Lithuania), which was formed by Mindaugas. Lithuania conquered the coast of the Baltic Sea from the Livonian order. The coast was populated by Curonians, but became a part of Samogitia. From the 13th century onwards, Samogitians settled within the former Curonian lands, and intermarried with the population over the next three hundred years. The Curonians were assimilated by the 16th century. Its dying language has influenced the dialect, in particular phonetics.

The earliest writings in the Samogitian language appeared in the 19th century.

== Phonology ==
Samogitian and its subdialects preserved many features of the Curonian language, for example:
*widening of proto Baltic short &quot;i&quot; (i → ė sometimes e)
*widening of proto Baltic short &quot;u&quot; (u → o)
*preservation of West Baltic diphthong &quot;ei&quot; (standard Lithuanian → Samogitian &quot;ėi&quot;)
*no t&#x27; d&#x27; palatalization to č dž (Latvian š, ž)
*specific lexis, like cīrulis (lark), pīle (duck), leitis (Lithuanian) etc.
*retraction of stress
*shortening of ending -as to -s like in Latvian and Old Prussian (Proto-Indo-European o-stem)
as well as various other features not listed here.

The earliest writings in Samogitian language appeared in the 16th century (Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas has been written mostly in south Samogtian dialect), more in 18th century (starting with &quot;Ziwatas Pona Yr Diewa Musu Jezusa Christusa&quot; written in 1759 in north Samogitian dialect).

() ė may be retracted in some sub-dialects to form () represented by the letter õ. Tėkrus → tõkrus, lėngvus → lõngvus, tėn → tõn. The vowel can be realized as close-mid central [ɘ] or close-mid back [ɤ], depending on the speaker.

== Grammar ==
The Samogitian language is highly inflected like standard Lithuanian, in which the relationships between parts of speech and their roles in a sentence are expressed by numerous flexions.
There are two grammatical genders in Samogitian – feminine and masculine. Relics of historical neuter are almost fully extinct while in standard Lithuanian some isolated forms remain. Those forms are replaced by masculine ones in Samogitian. Samogitian stress is mobile but often retracted at the end of words, and is also characterised by pitch accent. Samogitian has a broken tone like the Latvian and Danish languages. The circumflex of standard Lithuanian is replaced by an acute tone in Samogitian.

It has five noun and three adjective declensions. Noun declensions are different from standard Lithuanian (see the next section). There are only two verb conjugations. All verbs have present, past, past iterative and future tenses of the indicative mood, subjunctive (or conditional) and imperative moods (both without distinction of tenses) and infinitive. The formation of past iterative is different from standard Lithuanian. There are three numbers in Samogitian: singular, plural and dual. Dual is almost extinct in standard Lithuanian. The third person of all three numbers is common.
Samogitian as the standard Lithuanian has a very rich system of participles, which are derived from all tenses with distinct active and passive forms, and several gerund forms. Nouns and other declinable words are declined in eight cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative (inessive), vocative and illative.

== Literature ==
The earliest writings in Samogitian dialect appear in the 19th century. Famous authors writing in Samogitian:
* and his heroic poem “Biruta”, first printed in 1829. “Biruta” became a hymn of Lithuanian student emigrants in the 19th century.
*Simonas Stanevičius (Sėmuons Stanevėčios) with his famous book (Six fables) printed in 1829.
*Simonas Daukantas (Sėmuons Daukonts in Samogitian), he was the first Lithuanian historian writing in Lithuanian (actually in its dialect). His famous book – (Customs of ancient Lithuanian highlanders and Samogitians) was printed in 1854.
*Motiejus Valančius (Muotiejos Valončios or Valontė) and one of his books (Joseph of Palanga), printed in 1869.
There are no written grammar books in Samogitian because it was considered to be a dialect of Lithuanian, but there were some attempts to standardise its written form. Among those who have tried are , , Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė, B. Jurgutis, .
Today, Samogitian has a standardised writing system but it still remains a spoken language, as nearly everyone writes in their native speech.

== Differences from Standard Lithuanian ==

Samogitian differs from Standard Lithuanian in phonetics, lexicon, syntax and morphology.

Phonetic differences from standard Lithuanian are varied, each Samogitian subdialect (West, North and South) has different reflections.

Standard Lithuanian → Samogitian

*i → short ė, sometimes e;
*u → short o (in some cases u);
*ė → ;
*o → uo;
* → long ė, ėi, ī (y) (West, North and South);
*uo → ō, ou, ū (West, North and South);
*ai → ā ;
*ei, iai → ē;
*ui → oi;
*oi (oj) → uo;
*an → on (an in south-east);
*un → on (un in south-east);
*ą → an in south-eastern, on in the central region and ō or ou in the north;
*ę → en in south-eastern, ėn in the central region and õ, ō or ėi in the north;
*ū → ū (in some cases un, um);
*ų in stressed endings → un and um;
*unstressed ų → o;
*y → ī (y), sometimes in;
*i from ancient ī → ī;
*u from ancient ō (Lithuanian uo) → ō, ou, ū (West, North and South)
*i from ancient ei (Lithuanian ) → long ė, ėi, ī (West, North and South)
*č → t (also č under Lithuanian influence);
*dž → d (also dž under Lithuanian influence);
*ia → ė (somewhere between i and e);
*io → ė (somewhere between i and e);
*unstressed ią → ė (somewhere between i and e);

The main difference between Samogitian and standard Lithuanian is verb conjugation.
The past iterative tense is formed differently from Lithuanian (e.g., in Lithuanian the past iterative tense, meaning that action which was done in the past repeatedly, is made by removing the ending &quot;-ti&quot; and adding &quot;-davo&quot; (&quot;mirti&quot; – &quot;mirdavo&quot;, &quot;pūti&quot; – &quot;pūdavo&quot;), while in Samogitian, the word &quot;liuob&quot; is added instead before the word). The second verb conjugation merged with the first in Samogitian. The plural reflexive ending is &quot;-muos&quot; instead of expected &quot;-mies&quot; which is in standard Lithuanian (&quot;-mės&quot;) and other dialects. Samogitian preserved a lot of relics of athematic conjugation which did not survive in standard Lithuanian. The intonation in the future tense third person is the same as in the infinitive, in standard Lithuanian it shifts. The subjunctive conjugation is different from standard Lithuanian. Dual is preserved perfectly while in standard Lithuanian it has been completely lost.

The differences between nominals are considerable too.
The fifth noun declension has almost completely merged with the third declension. The plural and some singular cases of the fourth declension have endings of the first declension (e.g.: singular nominative &#x27;, plural nom. &#x27;, in standard Lithuanian: sg. nom. &#x27;, pl. nom. &#x27;). The neuter of adjectives has been pushed out by adverbs (except for &#x27; &#x27;warm&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;cold&#x27;, &quot;&quot; &#x27;hot&#x27;) in Samogitian. Neuter pronouns were replaced by masculine. The second declension of adjectives has almost merged with the first declension, with only singular nominative case endings staying separate. The formation of pronominals is also different from standard Lithuanian.

== Other morphological differences ==

Samogitian also has many words and figures of speech that are altogether different from typically Lithuanian ones, e.g., &#x27; – basket (Lith. , Latvian ), &#x27; – thin (Lith. , Latvian ), &#x27; – ribs (Lith. , Latvian ), &#x27; – &quot;can&#x27;t be!&quot; (Lith. ) and many more.

== Dialects ==
Samogitian is divided into three major dialects: Northern Samogitian (spoken in Telšiai and Kretinga regions), Western Samogitian (was spoken in the region around Klaipėda, now nearly extinct, – after 1945, many people were expelled and new ones came to this region) and Southern Samogitian (spoken in Varniai, Kelmė, Tauragė and Raseiniai regions). Historically, these are classified by their pronunciation of the Lithuanian word &quot;Duona,&quot; &quot;bread&quot;. They are referred to as Dounininkai (from &quot;Douna&quot;), Donininkai (from &quot;Dona&quot;) and Dūnininkai (from &quot;Dūna&quot;).

== Political situation ==
The Samogitian language is rapidly declining: it is not used in the local school system and there is only one quarterly magazine and no television broadcasts in Samogitian. There are some radio broadcasts in Samogitian (in Klaipėda and Telšiai). Local newspapers and broadcast stations use standard Lithuanian instead. There is no new literature in Samogitian either, as authors prefer standard Lithuanian for its accessibility to a larger audience. Out of those people who speak Samogitian, only a few can understand its written form.

Migration of Samogitian speakers to other parts of the country and migration into Samogitia have reduced contact between Samogitian speakers, and therefore the level of fluency of those speakers.

There are attempts by the Samogitian Cultural Society to stem the loss of the dialect. The council of Telšiai city put marks with Samogitian names for the city at the roads leading to the city, while the council of Skuodas claim to use the language during the sessions. A new system for writing Samogitian was created.

== Writing system ==
The first use of a unique writing system for Samogitian was in the interwar period, however it was neglected during the Soviet period, so only elderly people knew how to write in Samogitian at the time Lithuania regained independence. The Samogitian Cultural Society renewed the system to make it more usable.

The writing system uses similar letters to standard Lithuanian, but with the following differences:

*There are no nasal vowels (letters with ogoneks: ą, ę, į, ų).
*There are five additional long vowels, written with macrons above (as in Latvian): ā, ē, ė̄, ī, and ō. Lithuanian only has one letter with a macron: ū.
*Long i in Samogitian is written with a macron above: ī (unlike standard Lithuanian where it is y).
*The long vowel ė is written like ė with macron: Ė̄ and ė̄. Image:E smg.jpg In the pre-Unicode 8-bit computer fonts for Samogitian, the letter &#x27;ė with macron&#x27; was mapped on the code of the letter õ. From this circumstance a belief sprang that &#x27;ė with macron&#x27; could be substituted with the character õ. It is not so, however. In fact, if the letter &#x27;ė with macron&#x27; is for some reason not available, it can be substituted with the doubling of the macron-less letter, that is, &#x27;ėė&#x27;.
*There are two additional diphthongs in Samogitian that are written as digraphs: ou and ėi. (The component letters are part of the standard Lithuanian alphabet.)

As previously it was difficult to add these new characters to typesets, some older Samogitian texts use double letters instead of macrons to indicate long vowels, for example aa for ā and ee for ē; now the Samogitian Cultural Society discourages these conventions and recommends using the letters with macrons above instead. The use of double letters is accepted in cases where computer fonts do not have Samogitian letters; in such cases y is used instead of Samogitian ī, the same as in standard Lithuanian, while other long letters are written as double letters. The apostrophe might be used to denote palatalization in some cases; in others i is used for this, as in standard Lithuanian.

A Samogitian computer keyboard layout has been created.

She petitioned for her freedom and that of her son James (John) Henry from William Walker (a slave trader), based on having been held illegally as a slave in the free territory of Michigan by a previous master, an Army officer. Her case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri, where she won in 1836. The court ruled that an Army officer forfeited his slave if he took the person to territory where slavery is prohibited. This ruling was cited as precedent in 1856 in the famous &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; case before the Supreme Court of the United States.

Rachel&#x27;s was one of 301 19th-century freedom suits found among St. Louis Circuit Court records in the 1990s; it is the largest group of case files in the country available to researchers. The Missouri History Museum&#x27;s research center maintains a searchable database online of the freedom suits.

==History==
While slaves had no legal standing as citizens, under an 1824 Missouri state law, they were entitled to file as &quot;poor people&quot; to sue for freedom. If the court believed that the case had substantive grounds, it would assign counsel to represent the slave. The law further provided that the slaveholder must allow the slave time to consult with counsel and prohibited taking the slave from the jurisdiction of the court until the case was heard.

In the case, the court assigned Josiah Spalding as counsel to represent Rachel in her case. She had been held by the army lieutenant Thomas Stockton at Fort Snelling (present-day Minnesota), and her son had been born in 1834 at Fort Crawford, (present-day Wisconsin), both in the Michigan Territory (a free territory) at that time. Stockton had returned with Rachel and James Henry to St. Louis, where he sold them. The second owner resold them to the slave trader William Walker, who planned to take them &quot;downriver&quot; (down the Mississippi) for likely sale in New Orleans. Rachel sued for freedom based on having been illegally held as a slave during lengthy residence in free territories. Although the lower court ruled against Rachel, Spalding appealed the case to the Missouri Supreme Court. In 1836, it ruled in favor of Rachel in one of the decisions that established &quot;its tendency to enforce the laws of the neighboring free states&quot; that a slaveholder forfeited rights to a slave by taking the person into free territory.

By the time the case reached the State Supreme Court, it involved only Rachel. After her victory, she had to file a separate suit to free her son James Henry but was successful. The court continued with the precedent of &quot;Winny v. Whitesides&quot; (1824) in which the state supreme court held that a slave was free after having been held illegally in a free state and &quot;once free always free.&quot; Specifically, the it held that &quot;if an officer of the United States Army takes a slave to a territory where slavery is prohibited, he forfeits his property.&quot; The case was based on a woman, &quot;Winny,&quot; who petitioned the Missouri Supreme Court, and her case established the Missouri precedent for freeing slaves who had lived in free territory. She claimed that her owner Phoebe Whitesides had imprisoned her without cause. Whitesides had moved from North Carolina to St. Louis, Missouri. If she were declared free, her nine children and grandchildren would also be declared free. This case went to trial and the St. Louis circuit court on 13 February 1822. The jury&#x27;s decision freed Winny and her descendants. Whitesides appealed the case and it came before the Missouri Supreme Court in 1824. Again, the court decision favored Winny and her descendants. The court ruled, &quot;We are clearly of opinion that if, by a residence in Illinois (Whitesides) lost her right to the property in the defendant, that right was not revived by a removal, of the parties to Missouri.&quot;

Following is a transcript of Rachel&#x27;s petition for freedom:
To the Judge of the St. Louis Circuit Court

The petition of Rachel, a mulatto woman aged about twenty years of age represents that about five years ago she was claimed and possessed as a slave by one Stockton, who then took your petitioner to the territory of Michigan, where he resided at Prairie du Chien, on the east side of the Mississippi River for about two years, holding your petitioner a slave during that time at that place arranging her to work for &amp; serve himself &amp; family at that place. At which place her child James Henry was born he being held by this Stockton during that time as a slave. That afterwards he brought your petitioner to St. Louis where he sold her and the child to one Joseph Klunk who has recently sold her and said child to one William Walker, who is a dealer in slaves &amp; is about to take your petitioner and the child down the Mississippi River, probably to New Orleans for sale. That said Walker now holds your petitioner and child in slavery, claiming her as his slave, and your petitioner prays that your petitioner and said child may be allowed to sue as a poor person in the St. Louis Circuit Court for freedom &amp; that the said Walker may be restrained from carrying her &amp; said child out of the jurisdiction of the St. Louis Circuit Court till the termination of said suit. November 4th, 1834 

Rachel (her mark) for her self and child James Henry (p. 1 of 24)

==Decision==
Justice Mathias McGirk of the Missouri Supreme Court said that Stockton had &quot;willfully procured a slave and held her, unlawfully, in free territories, an act punishable by forfeiture of the slave, as decreed by territorial law.&quot; With this ruling, he was supporting the laws of the neighboring free territories and states and closing a loophole by which Army officers had tried to argue they could keep slaves. Stockton had argued that he had no choice in his assignments with the Army, so should not have to lose his slave property as a result.

Rachel&#x27;s success in this case gave her the basis to successfully sue for freedom for her son James Henry; as he was born to a woman held illegally as a slave in a free state (and freed on those grounds), he was also free, according to the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem,&quot; in which the child gained his social status from his mother.

<text>The Battle of Tayacoba, June 30, 1898, (also spelled Tayabacao) was an American special operations effort to land supplies and reinforcements to Cuban rebels fighting for their independence in the Spanish–American War.

==Background==
On June 25 the American steamships &quot;Fanita&quot; and &quot;Florida&quot; accompanied by the gunboat left Key West carrying a cargo of troops, ammunition, supplies and arms (including two dynamite guns, 4,000 Springfield rifles and 200 Mauser rifles), to aid Cuban insurgents under the command of Máximo Gómez. On board were 650 Cubans under General Emilio Núñez, fifty troopers of the Tenth U.S. Cavalry under Carter P. Johnson and Second Lieutenant George P. Ahern, and twenty-five &quot;Rough Riders&quot; under Captain Winthrop Astor Chanler, brother of Captain William Astor Chanler.

The first attempt to land took place on June 29 near the port of Cienfuegos, at the mouth of the San Juan River, however as a result of a prior assault on May 11, the position was too heavily defended to effect a landing. On June 30 a landing party went ashore on a beachhead just west of Tunas de Zaza, near the mouth of the Tallabacoa River (mispronounced &#x27;Tayacoba&#x27; by the Americans).

==Battle==
Four miles west of the town, at the mouth of the river, stood a large fort built of railroad iron, surrounded by earthworks and defended by about 100 Spanish regulars. The &quot;Peoria&quot; fired several shots with her three-pounders into the fort but there was no response. Before dropping off mules, men, and materiel, a party of 30 Cubans and Americans led by Captain Jose Manuel Núñez (brother of General Núñez) and including Winthrop Chanler and Dr. William Louis Abbott, went ashore to ensure the safety of the landing site, about 500 yards east of the fort.

Rowing onto the beach, the force crept into the jungle but was discovered by Spanish scouts and came under heavy fire. Unable to retaliate or even protect themselves, the Americans retreated onto the beach only to find that their boats had been sunk by Spanish cannon fire. Captain Núñez died of a gunshot wound to the head, Chanler was shot in the elbow, and Abbott was shot through the right shoulder. Five Cuban soldiers were also wounded. The party took cover in a mangrove swamp and one of them, a Danish surgeon named Dr. Maximilian Lund swam out to the &quot;Peoria&quot; (naked and armed only with a knife to fend off sharks) to report that survivors on the beach were in need of assistance.

==Rescue==
The &quot;Peoria&quot; continued firing at the Spanish troops, who were hidden behind a grove of coconut palms. On the &quot;Florida&quot; Lieutenant Johnson began organizing rescue attempts. The first four were dispersed by heavy enemy fire and forced to retreat, but the fifth, operating under cover of darkness and crewed by four men of the U.S. 10th Cavalry under the command of Lieutenant Ahern, successfully located the Cuban survivors. The body of Captain Núñez was left on the beach.

Just before sunrise, a second boat manned by Lieutenant Ahern and war correspondent (later Lieutenant) Grover Flint located Chanler and Abbott. Once they were safely aboard, the &quot;Florida&quot; promptly left the bay.

==Aftermath==
On the afternoon of July 2 the &quot;Peoria&quot; returned to the mouth of the Tallacaboa River accompanied by the USS &quot;Helena&quot; and shelled the fort for 30 minutes, damaging it and the earthworks and setting fire to the Spanish quarter in the nearby town of Tunas de Zaza. The liners proceeded 40 miles east to Palo Alto, near the town of Trinidad, where the Cuban troops and supplies disembarked on July 3. 

On June 23, 1899, four of the five rescuers, Private William H. Thompkins, Private George H. Wanton, Trooper Dennis Bell, and Trooper Fitz Lee, all of the 10th US Cavalry, were awarded Medals of Honor for their heroism. Winthrop Chanler returned to his home in Barrytown, New York to recover from his injuries. He returned briefly to military service as a Captain in the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. William Louis Abbott recovered from his wound and returned to his previous occupation as an ornithologist.

<doc id="1219853" wikidata="Q7340678" url="?curid=1219853" title="Rob Zicari">
<text>Robert D. Zicari (born August 5, 1974), also known as Rob Black, is an American pornographer, entrepreneur, podcaster and professional wrestling promoter. Together with his then-wife Janet &quot;Lizzy Borden&quot; Romano, he owned the porn company &quot;Extreme Associates&quot;. Zicari was prosecuted for distribution of obscenity by the United States Department of Justice in 2004. The case was dismissed but was reinstated upon appeal in 2005. Zicari entered into a plea agreement with the government in 2009, ending the case.

== Career ==
Zicari became a porn director in the mid-1990s. His former porn company &quot;Extreme Video&quot; was started in 1993/1994. In 1998, he founded the porn company, Extreme Associates, together with fellow porn directors Tom Byron and Van Damage and porn star Tiffany Mynx (who have since left the company). Janet Romano started to work for him in the same year, first as an actress and then as a director. His work often involved scenes considered egregious and extreme even by other members of the pornography industry, such as adult performers acting as young girls, or a simulated rape of a disabled person in a wheelchair in &quot;Miscreants&quot; (1997).

Black appeared as himself in the documentary film (1999). Beginning in 2000, Zicari and AVN Magazine engaged in a &quot;propaganda war&quot; against one another, and as a result, Black&#x27;s products were not reviewed or advertised in that trade magazine for several years.

In 2001, Zicari (as Rob Black) unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Los Angeles, receiving 789 votes.

Zicari owns and operates the American Cheeseburger restaurant. In addition, Zicari owns and operates Extreme Gifts, a store specializing in adult and marijuana products.

== Obscenity prosecution ==

The filming of Lizzy Borden&#x27;s movie &quot;Forced Entry&quot;, which included several simulated rapes, was covered in the &quot;PBS Frontline&quot; documentary &quot;American Porn&quot; (2002); the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set. The filming of the movie was also a part of documentary produced for BBC 2 hosted by Louis Theroux which follows various figures of the porn industry. Theroux also leaves the set in a similar manner to that of the PBS documentary. After, Zicari was interviewed in the documentary and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft. These scenes possibly led to the subsequent undercover operation by federal authorities.

In April 2003, the premises of Extreme Associates were raided by federal agents. Zicari, his then wife Lizzy Borden and his company were indicted for distributing obscene pornographic materials. The case is &quot;United States v. Extreme Associates&quot;.

Zicari&#x27;s company is located in Northridge near Los Angeles, but the trial took place in Pittsburgh, from where under-cover agents had ordered the offending materials.

Zicari remained in business during the trial; he continued to market and sell the five tapes that are at the center of the prosecution as &quot;The Federal Five&quot;, with a portion of the sales price going to his defense fund. Note that buyers of those materials do not break the law, since mere possession of obscenity (unlike production and distribution) is not illegal.

In April 2004, Zicari engaged in a public dispute with fellow pornographer Larry Flynt, who also had to fight various obscenity trials in the past. Zicari asked the adult industry for financial support to aid in his defense; Flynt declined, saying that he only promotes consensual sex and that Zicari&#x27;s actions harmed the industry as a whole.

Zicari&#x27;s lawyer H. Louis Sirkin initially argued that laws against the distribution of obscenity were unconstitutional since people have a right to own obscenity, but this argument was rebuffed on appeal.

After six years of legal costs, Black and his wife both pleaded guilty to the reinstated federal obscenity charges in hopes to avoid more extensive loss and penalties if they lost at actual trial.

Zicari and his wife were both sentenced to one year and one day in prison on July 1, 2009. In late September the couple began serving their prison sentences, Zicari at La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution in Texas and his wife at Waseca Federal Correctional Institution in Minnesota. Instead of reporting to the intended minimum-security satellite facility, Zicari mistakenly reported to the prison&#x27;s primary facility, where officials placed him in solitary confinement for nearly a month because it &quot;was the only space they had available&quot;. In March 2013, Zicari revealed on his radio show, The Rob Black Show, that he was actually placed in solitary because he was mistakenly designated as a sex offender because of the obscenity charges.

== Xtreme Pro Wrestling ==

In 1999, Zicari and Tom Byron founded the XPW professional wrestling promotion. He appeared on shows as the owner as well as a manager under the name of Rob Black. His heel (bad guy) stable was called the &quot;Black Army&quot; and featured wrestlers such as John Kronus, Terry Funk, Abdullah the Butcher, and Juventud Guerrera. XPW folded in 2003 because of issues related to the obscenity prosecution, and in 2004 Zicari sold the company&#x27;s footage to Xtreme Entertainment Group. In 2012, Zicari regained control and ownership of XPW. Zicari relaunched XPW in 2021, after &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; aired its XPW episode in Season 3.

== The Rob Black Show ==
In March 2013, Zicari launched &quot;The Rob Black Show&quot; on Blog Talk Radio. The Daily Beast called him &quot;Porn&#x27;s Dirty Whistleblower&quot; for revealing unsafe practices on set, business arrangements that exploit performers and common sidelines such as porn talent agents working their charges on escort sites.

<text>The Gliwice Radio Tower is a transmission tower in the Szobiszowice district of Gliwice, Upper Silesia, Poland. Nazi Germany staged a false flag attack on the tower in 1939, which was used as a pretext for invading Poland, beginning World War II.

==Structure==
The Gliwice Radio Tower is tall, with a wooden framework of impregnated siberian larch linked by brass connectors. It was nicknamed &quot;the Silesian Eiffel Tower&quot; by the local population. The tower has four platforms, at , , and above ground. The top platform measures square. A ladder with 365 steps provides access to the top.

The tower is the tallest wooden structure in Europe. The tower was originally designed to carry aerials for medium wave broadcasting, but that transmitter is no longer in service because the final stage is missing. Today, the Gliwice Radio Tower carries multiple transceiver antennas for mobile phone services and a low-power FM transmitter broadcasting on 93.4 MHz.

==History==
The tower was erected from 1 August 1934 as &quot;Sendeturm Gleiwitz&quot; (Gleiwitz Radio Tower), when the territory was part of Germany. It was operated by the &quot;Reichssender Breslau&quot; (former &quot;Schlesische Funkstunde&quot; broadcasting corporation) of the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft radio network. The tower was modeled on the Mühlacker radio transmitter, it replaced a smaller transmitter in Gleiwitz situated nearby on Raudener Straße and went in service on 23 December 1935.

On 31 August 1939, the German SS staged a &#x27;Polish&#x27; attack on Gleiwitz radio station, which next morning was used as justification (Seit 5 Uhr 45 wird jetzt zurückgeschossen! / We are now, since 5.45, returning fire!) for the invasion of Poland. The transmission facility was not demolished in World War II. From 4 October 1945 until the inauguration of the new transmitter in Ruda Śląska in 1955 the Gliwice transmitter was used for medium-wave transmissions by the Polish state broadcaster Polskie Radio. After 1955, it was used to jam medium-wave stations (such as Radio Free Europe) broadcasting Polish-language programmes from Western Europe.

<text>William Morgan DeBeck (April 15, 1890 – November 11, 1942), better known as Billy DeBeck, was an American cartoonist. He is most famous as the creator of the comic strip &quot;Barney Google&quot;, later retitled &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;. The strip was especially popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and featured a number of well-known characters, including the title character, Bunky, Snuffy Smith, and Spark Plug the race horse. Spark Plug was a merchandising phenomenon, and has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s.

DeBeck drew with a scratchy line in a &quot;big-foot&quot; style, in which characters had giant feet and bulbous noses. His strips often reflected his love of sports. In 1946, the National Cartoonists Society inaugurated the Billy DeBeck Memorial Awards (or the Barney Awards), which became the Reuben Award in 1954.

==Life and career==

===Early life===

William Morgan DeBeck was born on April 15, 1890, on the South Side of Chicago, where his father, Louis DeBeck, was a newspaperman employed by the Swift Company. The elder DeBeck was of French descent, and the name &quot;DeBeck&quot; was originally spelled &quot;DeBecque&quot;. His mother, Jessie Lee Morgan, was of Irish and Welsh descent, and had lived on a farm and was a schoolteacher.

===Early career===

After graduating from Hyde Park High School in 1908, DeBeck attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. He sold cartoon drawings during this time to finance himself, at first in 1908 for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. His caricatures of models drew the attention of his fellow students, and though he had intended to become a painter in the Flemish tradition, he quit the Academy after two years after he got a cartooning job with the weekly paper &quot;Show World&quot; in 1910. His cartoons showed the influence of John T. McCutcheon and Clare Briggs, whom he had admired in his youth; he also had the skill to draw in the more fastidiously cross-hatched style of a Charles Dana Gibson, copies of whose drawings he sold as originals.

DeBeck soon left &quot;Show World&quot; for better opportunities at &quot;Youngstown Telegram&quot; in Ohio as an editorial cartoonist, then again at the &quot;Pittsburgh Gazette-Time&quot; in late August 1912. He later contributed cartoons to the New York City humor magazines &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Judge&quot;. While living in Pittsburgh, he traveled to New York to show comic strip samples to Arthur Brisbane, an editor working for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s newspaper empire; Brisbane rejected the work. DeBeck later stated the examples &quot;were terrible&quot; as he &quot;had been doing political cartoons for the &quot;Pittsburgh Gazette&quot;, and the comics were new&quot; to him. He returned to Youngstown and married Marion Louise Shields there in 1914.

In May 1915, DeBeck and a partner named Carter launched a newspaper syndicate and correspondence cartooning course; DeBeck&#x27;s advice to his correspondence students was: &quot;First learn how to draw—then go to a good art school and get a firm foundation in the arts&quot;. The school was not a success, and DeBeck returned to Chicago and joined the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; in December 1915. He worked on a strip called &quot;Finn an&#x27; Haddie&quot; for the Adams Newspaper Service on the side. On December 9, immediately after starting at the &quot;Herald&quot;, he began a strip called &quot;Married Life&quot; that so caught the attention of Hearst; legend says that, to acquire DeBeck, Hearst bought the &quot;Herald&quot; and merged it with the &quot;Chicago Examiner&quot;, as DeBeck had refused to join the Hearst empire after the &quot;Examiner&quot; raised his monthly salary from $35 to $200. DeBeck&#x27;s creations were first adapted to film when an animated version of &quot;Married Life&quot; appeared in a &quot;Seattle Sunday Times&quot; newsreel in 1917. DeBeck created a number of other features, especially for the sports section, while his antics made him something of a local celebrity.

===Barney Google===

On June 17, 1919, a new comic strip by DeBeck in the vein of &quot;Married Life&quot; debuted on the sports page; &quot;Take Barney Google, For Instance&quot;. It differed in that it was about a henpecked, sports-obsessed husband and his travails defying his wife. Google was interested in non-fictional sports stories, such as the heavyweight championship between Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey. It was not long before DeBeck refigured the tall, thin Google into the short, squat character he was to be remembered as, and the title too was soon shortened to &quot;Barney Google&quot;. It was not popular until DeBeck had Google acquire a race horse named Spark Plug (nicknamed &quot;Sparky&quot;) in a strip dated July 17, 1922. The dilapidated, blanket-covered horse became such a marketing and merchandising phenomenon that the character has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s—toys, balloons, and games were among the popular items adorned with Sparky&#x27;s image. When DeBeck introduced the horse, he also introduced a little-used technique into the strip: continuity. &quot;Barney Google&quot; went from being a gag-a-day strip to one in which both humor and suspense kept readers coming back each day, as Google desperately tried to get his horse to win a race. The sequence in which Spark Plug was introduced into the strip was republished in the October 1922 issue of &quot;Comic Monthly&quot;—likely the earliest newsstand comics periodical.

DeBeck kept readers on the edges of their seats with uncertain suspense: sometimes Spark Plug actually won a race. While DeBeck resisted at first, Hearst demanded a pretty girl be introduced into the strip. DeBeck brought in Sweet Mama, which initially created a stir, and certain papers dropped the strip, but after the phrase swept the nation, the strip&#x27;s popularity only increased. Over the years, DeBeck was credited with introducing more neologisms and catchphrases, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;balls of fire&quot; and &quot;time&#x27;s a-wastin&#x27;&quot;. In 1923, Billy Rose penned a Tin Pan Alley pop hit called &quot;Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)&quot;. A series of &quot;Barney Google&quot; live-action films starring Barney Hellum appeared in 1928 and 1929.

DeBeck had included a topper called &quot;Bughouse Fables&quot; (signed &quot;Barney Google)&quot; with his main strip since 1921, though he soon handed it off to assistant Paul Fung. On May 16, 1926, he replaced &quot;Bughouse Fables&quot; with &quot;Parlor, Bedroom &amp; Sink Starring Bunky&quot;, a strip that was popular enough on its own to survive until 1948.

According to later &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot; scripter Brian Walker, DeBeck had become &quot;one of the highest-paid cartoonists in America&quot; at this point. In the early 1920s, DeBeck moved to Riverside Drive in New York City, and in 1927 remarried Mary Louise Dunne. The couple spent the next two years in Europe, after which they settled down again in New York. DeBeck&#x27;s active lifestyle sometimes caused him to miss deadlines. He enjoyed traveling, deep sea fishing, golf and playing bridge. As a golfer since 1916, DeBeck spent time on courses with such notables as Harold Lloyd, Walter Huston, Rube Goldberg, Fontaine Fox, Clarence Budington Kelland and bridge authority P. Hal Sims. He was also acquainted with such celebrities as Babe Ruth, Lowell Thomas and Damon Runyon. His best friend was the cartoonist Frank Willard, who also attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts.

===Snuffy Smith===

&quot;Barney Google&quot;″s popularity persisted into the Depression era; in 1933, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine reported DeBeck&#x27;s weekly earnings at $1200. In the spring of 1933, DeBeck hired 17-year-old Fred Lasswell as an assistant after seeing a big poster of Lasswell&#x27;s funny characters rushing to the Tampa Chamber of Commerce Jamboree. DeBeck was a refined city gentleman, an avid golfer, world traveler, and bon vivant. He wanted to create a rural down-home character with whom depression-era audiences could relate. He needed some help. Fred Lasswell was a confirmed hayseed from the sticks with much kinfolk wisdom, make-do humor, a talent for drawing clean lines and blending funny images with text. Lasswell recalls his &quot;big tour with Billy&quot; and the copious notes DeBeck took of Hillbilly phrases, while Lasswell drew sketches of backwoods characters, critters and scenes he already knew. The result became comic strip history in 1934, when Snuffy Smith met Barney Google and sales of the comic strip, soon to become &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;, soared. Over the next seven years, Lasswell became the son DeBeck never had. DeBeck sent him to apprentice with some of the great illustrators, to study at the Art Students League in New York, and to walk the streets of the city with a sketchbook to capture the movement, personalities and situations he saw. After eight years of mentoring Lasswell, DeBeck died and Lasswell took over his mentor&#x27;s strip. Under Lasswell &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot; has become the longest continuously produced comic strip in American&#x27;s newspaper history.

DeBeck gained a growing interest into the culture of Appalachia in the 1930s and amassed a library on the subject that he later donated to Virginia Commonwealth University. Among the books he admired were those featuring Sut Lovingood by George Washington Harris; inside &quot;Sut Lovingood Yarns&quot; (1867) DeBeck produced his first sketch of Snuffy Smith, a character that grew from talking with and sketching the Appalachian hillbilly locals. Just as the strip&#x27;s circulation was starting to flag, DeBeck introduced Snuffy in a storyline in which Barney inherited an estate in the mountains of North Carolina. After dodging the ornery hillbilly&#x27;s bullets, the two became fast friends. The strip was eventually renamed &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;, and Snuffy would take over from Barney Google as the central character. Lasswell, with his own country roots, provided much of the inspiration for Snuffy and his Appalachian environment. Especially, he provided a source for the locals&#x27; dialect. Hillbilly culture enjoyed much popularity in the 1930s; Snuffy Smith appeared the same year as Al Capp&#x27;s &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. By 1940, DeBeck&#x27;s strip appeared in 210 newspapers with a combined circulation of ten million.

The Charles Mintz studios produced four full-color animated &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot; shorts in 1935. The series had two more live-action adaptations in 1942: Bud Duncan starred as Snuffy Smith in &quot;Private Snuffy Smith&quot; and co-starred with Cliff Nazarro as Barney Google in &quot;Hillbilly Blitzkrieg&quot;.

===Later life and death===

DeBeck had a studio apartment on Park Avenue in New York, and homes in Great Neck in New York and St. Petersburg in Florida. In the early 1940s, he developed cancer and found it increasingly difficult to work. Sensing his end was near, he made a special trip to see Marian Shields. His last signed daily strip appeared July 4, 1942, and his last Sunday the following August 2. With Lasswell contributing to the war effort, the strip continued under an assistant, Joe Musial. On November 11, 1942, DeBeck died at the age of 52 in New York City, with his wife at his bedside. They had no children. &quot;Barney Google&quot; appeared in 206 newspapers at the time, and Musial continued the strip until Lasswell took it on full-time in 1945. Over time, Barney faded from the strip, and the title contracted to &quot;Snuffy Smith&quot;.

In 1943, Mary DeBeck donated to the Ringling School of Art all of her husband&#x27;s art supplies, including drawing tables, reams of drawing paper, hundreds of colored pencils, lamps, drawing boards, inks, drawing pens, artist smocks, etching plates, and an etching press. She remarried, and died February 14, 1953, aboard National Airlines Flight 470, a DC-6 that fell into the Gulf of Mexico during a thunderstorm on a flight from Tampa to New Orleans.

==Style==

DeBeck&#x27;s drawing style falls in the &quot;big-foot&quot; tradition of American comic strips such as &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot;, and Robert Crumb. It had a scratchy line and characters with bulbous noses and giant feet. Though he often procrastinated, DeBeck could work quickly and make it just in time for his deadlines.

DeBeck put &quot;Barney Google&quot; through great changes throughout his twenty-three-year run on the strip, changing situations and characters frequently. The storylines reflected the outlook of the 1920s boom years, the Great Depression, and World War II.

==Legacy==

DeBeck&#x27;s main strip continued in the hands of Fred Lasswell long after its creator&#x27;s death. The number of newspaper that carried it had been flagging in the years leading to DeBeck&#x27;s passing, partly because the hillbilly dialect in the dialogue was difficult to read for many. The syndicate informed Lasswell that if many more newspapers dropped the strip, it would be canceled. Lasswell refocused on Snuffy Smith, dropped much of the dialect, and moved away from continuity to a gag-a-day format. The strip&#x27;s popularity once again increased, and by 1989 it was running in 900 newspapers in 21 countries. It has continued in different hands since Lasswell&#x27;s death in 2001.

Debeck&#x27;s hillbilly depictions, though stereotyped and distorted, had a higher degree of accuracy than those of Al Capp or other contemporary cartoonists, and painted hillbillies in a better light. DeBeck included authentic expressions such as &quot;plime-blank&quot; (&quot;exactly&quot;) and &quot;a lavish of&quot; (&quot;a lot of&quot;), and included explanations of dialect unfamiliar to his readers. Some such as country singer Roy Acuff objected that the strip perpetuated stereotypes of hillbilly culture.

DeBeck is credited with introducing or popularizing a number of neologisms and catchphrases via &quot;Barney Google&quot;, including &quot;heebie-jeebies&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;hotsy totsy&quot;, &quot;balls of fire&quot;, &quot;time&#x27;s a-wastin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;touched in the head&quot;, and &quot;bodacious&quot;.

Charles M. Schulz, creator of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, was nicknamed &quot;Sparky&quot; after DeBeck&#x27;s racehorse character, and DeBeck&#x27;s drawing style has been an influence on contemporary cartooning and popular culture, and on such later cartoonists as Robert Crumb and Bobby London. The &quot;Barney Google&quot; Sunday page for September 18, 1938, was placed in the time capsule at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair.

The National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s annual award was originally named the Billy DeBeck Memorial Award. Created by Mary DeBeck Bergman in 1946, these were known as the Barney Awards. She also made the annual presentation of engraved silver cigarette cases, with DeBeck&#x27;s characters etched on the cover, to the winners (Milton Caniff, Al Capp, Chic Young, Alex Raymond, Roy Crane, Walt Kelly, Hank Ketcham and Mort Walker). In 1954, after her death, the DeBeck Award was renamed the Reuben Award after Rube Goldberg, and all of the earlier winners were re-awarded Reuben statuettes.

<text>Paul De Lucia (born Felice De Lucia, ; November 14, 1897 – October 11, 1972), known as Paul Ricca (, ), was an Italian-American mobster who served as the nominal or &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Chicago Outfit for 40 years. In 1958 he was named &quot;the country&#x27;s most important criminal&quot; by a Senate crime investigating subcommittee. Ricca died on October 11, 1972.

==Early life==
Ricca was born Felice De Lucia on November 14, 1897, in Naples, Campania to Antonio and Maria Annunziata De Lucia. He had four younger sisters: Emilia Beatrice, Anna Clementina, Clementina Eleonora, and Luisa Maria. By age 17, he was working for organized crime in Naples (Camorra). In 1915, he stabbed Emilio Parrillo to death on Mafia orders. Ricca later claimed that he killed Parillo for breaking an engagement with his sister. In 1917, Ricca was convicted of murder, serving two years in prison. Once released from prison, Ricca killed Vincenzo Capasso, who had testified against him in the Parillo trial, by slitting his throat.

After killing Capasso, Ricca assumed the name Paul Maglio and fled to the United States through Cuba. On August 10, 1920, Ricca arrived in New York City.

In January 1927, Ricca married Nancy Emily Gigante, who was also from Naples, and had three children: Mary Anna, Anthony Paul, and Paul Richard. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1928 and legally changed his name to Paul De Lucia.

==Joining the mob==
While in Cuba, Ricca had met Joseph &quot;Diamond Joe&quot; Esposito, a Chicago bootlegger and restaurant owner. After Ricca arrived in New York, Esposito brought him to Chicago, where he put him to work smuggling whiskey from Cuba and moonshine liquor from Kentucky to Chicago. Sensing Ricca&#x27;s potential, Esposito appointed him as maitre d&#x27; at the Bella Napoli, Esposito&#x27;s Chicago restaurant, earning him the nickname &quot;the Waiter.&quot; The Bella Napoli was popular with many Chicago gangsters, including the leader of the South Side Gang (the precursor to the Chicago Outfit), Al Capone. Sharing several mutual friends among Neapolitan gangsters who had returned to Italy, Ricca soon quit his restaurant job and joined the South Side Gang.

==Working with Capone and Nitti==
Ricca advanced very quickly in the gang ranks. An early event that contributed to his rise occurred outside Capone&#x27;s headquarters in the Hawthorne Hotel in Cicero, Illinois, on September 20, 1926. While Capone was eating in the restaurant next to the hotel, and as Ricca was about to enter the same restaurant to meet with him, several vehicles being driven by North Side gangsters, Capone&#x27;s rivals, began firing several Thompson submachine gun rounds into the air and at the hotel. Ricca, recognizing the oncoming danger, quickly ran to where Capone was sitting and warned him just in time for Capone to get down, saving him from getting shot. Ricca sustained a gunshot wound to his left shoulder and, when asked by the police for his name, identified himself with an alias, Louis Barko.

Capone responded by praising Ricca. The two soon became good friends; in 1927, Capone served as the best man at Ricca&#x27;s wedding.

In 1929, Capone and Ricca attended the Atlantic City Conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the first meeting of all the major criminal gangs in the United States. In 1930, Capone sent Ricca to New York City to serve as his emissary in peace talks aimed at ending the Castellammarese War between the New York Italian-American gangs. Ricca&#x27;s prestige and visibility continued to rise with the establishment of the National Crime Syndicate in 1931.

In 1931, Capone was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Capone&#x27;s nominal successor was Frank &quot;the Enforcer&quot; Nitti, with Ricca as his underboss. However, according to crime historian Carl Sifakis, Ricca held the actual power in the Outfit. Ricca frequently overruled Nitti&#x27;s orders, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll do it this way. Now let&#x27;s hear no more about it!&quot; In addition, the leaders of the emerging Syndicate, including Lucky Luciano, dealt only with Ricca, not Nitti. 

In April 1932, Luciano and Meyer Lansky, another top leader in the Crime Syndicate, were in the company of Ricca and other Chicago and New York gangsters when they were arrested by the police outside the Congress Hotel in Chicago. All the men arrested were freed since the police had no reason to keep them detained, but not before taking a picture of the gangsters in a police line-up. The fact that the East Coast leaders met with Ricca personally in Chicago demonstrates the New York mob&#x27;s trust toward him as the leader of the Chicago mob.

Ricca was relatively soft-spoken but was as ruthless as any crime boss. Whenever he wanted someone rubbed out, he said, &quot;Make-a him go away.&quot; Crime historian Joe Sifakis described him as one of the most stereotypical gangsters ever produced by the Chicago Outfit.

However, unlike his former bosses, Esposito and Capone, Ricca avoided the flamboyance and media attention-seeking that had helped bring about Esposito&#x27;s and Capone&#x27;s downfall, preferring to maintain a low profile to avoid attention from the media and law enforcement. Although he was arrested several times during his early years in the mob, including his January 24, 1927, arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, which was when his mugshot was taken, he was never convicted on any serious charges until the 1940s, and his mob associates expressed envy over his minor police record.

==Hollywood extortion case==
In the early 1940s, Nitti convinced Ricca and the rest of the Outfit leadership to participate in a labor racketeering and extortion scheme aimed at the movie studios in Los Angeles, California. Chicago mobster John &quot;Handsome Johnny&quot; Roselli gained control of the Projectors Union and threatened the studios with strikes and other labor problems. To avoid labor unrest, RKO, Paramount, MGM and 20th Century Fox paid several hundred thousand dollars to the Outfit. However, two Outfit men Willie Bioff and George Browne were arrested for extortion and agreed to testify against the Outfit leadership. In March 1943, Ricca, Nitti, and other mob leaders were indicted for extortion.

On March 18, 1943, Ricca and the Outfit leadership met with Nitti. Since the movie studio racket was Nitti&#x27;s idea, Ricca and the Outfit leaders demanded that Nitti plead guilty to extortion charges to save them from prison. Terrified at the prospect of prison due to his severe claustrophobia, Nitti shot himself to death the next day. Ricca now became the official boss of the Outfit, with enforcement chief Tony Accardo as underboss. Ricca and Accardo would run the Outfit for the next 30 years.

==Extortion conviction==
On December 30, 1943, Ricca and his associates were convicted of extortion and sentenced to ten years each in federal prison. Ricca began his sentence at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta but was soon lobbying for a transfer to Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas. The Atlanta warden, reportedly prejudiced against Italians, had severely beaten Outfit mobster Phil D&#x27;Andrea, making Ricca and the others fearful for their lives. After a series of contacts, St. Louis, Missouri, lawyer Paul Dillon allegedly offered the head of the federal parole board payment to approve a transfer to Leavenworth for the Outfit mobster.

In May 1945, against the recommendations of both wardens, Ricca and the other mobsters were moved to Leavenworth. During this period, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accepted a cash settlement from Ricca for back taxes. On August 13, 1947, after a one-week deliberation, the parole board released Ricca and his co-defendants from prison on parole. However, as a condition of his parole, Ricca could not contact mobsters.

Accardo, therefore, replaced Ricca as boss. It was generally acknowledged, though, that Accardo shared power with Ricca, who stayed in the background. No significant transactions, and certainly no hits, took place without Ricca&#x27;s knowledge. It was one of the few known instances of a power-sharing arrangement in organized crime.

==Ricca and Giancana==
As the 1950s began, Ricca started passing more of the responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the Outfit to Accardo. However, in 1957, Ricca suddenly told Accardo that he wanted Sam Giancana, a Ricca protégé, to take Accardo&#x27;s position. Accardo was facing tax evasion charges, and Ricca allegedly wanted him to disappear from public view.

Although unhappy about the demotion, Accardo accepted it, joining Ricca in semi-retirement. However, it was understood that Giancana had to get Accardo and Ricca&#x27;s approval for all significant transactions, particularly hits. By staying in the background, Ricca and Accardo avoided further imprisonment far longer than Capone had.

As Ricca aged, Accardo began to make more high-level decisions, ultimately pushing Giancana out in favor of Sam Battaglia in 1966.

==Later years==
In 1957, the federal government charged Ricca with illegally entering the United States under the alias Paul Maglio. Three years earlier, the government had located the real Paul Maglio in Chicago and brought him to testify against Ricca, whose citizenship was revoked. Although the government won a deportation order, it was later overturned.

In 1959, Ricca was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to nine years in federal prison. After serving 27 months of his sentence, Ricca was released. In 1965, Ricca was again indicted for tax evasion. In court, Ricca maintained that his total income for 1963, $80,159, was earned at the race track. Ricca was eventually acquitted.

Ricca died of a heart attack on October 11, 1972, at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Chicago. He is buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

==In popular culture==
*In the AMC series &quot;The Making of the Mob: New York&quot;, Ricca is portrayed by Christopher Valente.

<text>Panthera spelaea, commonly known as the cave lion (or less commonly as the steppe lion), is an extinct &quot;Panthera&quot; species that was native to Eurasia and northwest North America during the Pleistocene epoch. Genetic analysis of ancient DNA has revealed that while closely related, it was a distinct species genetically isolated from the modern lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;), with the genetic divergence between the two species estimated at around 500,000 years ago. 

The earliest fossils of the &quot;P. spelaea&quot; lineage (either regarded as the separate species &quot;Panthera fossilis&quot; or the subspecies &quot;P. spelaea fossilis&quot;) in Eurasia date to around 700,000 years ago (with possible late Early Pleistocene records). It is closely related and probably ancestral to the American lion (&quot;Panthera atrox&quot;). The species ranged from Western Europe to eastern Beringia in North America, and was a prominent member of the mammoth steppe fauna, and an important apex predator across its range. It became extinct about 13,000 years ago. It closely resembled living lions with a coat of yellowish-grey fur though unlike extant lions, males appear to have lacked manes. Unlike their modern relative, they may have been solitary.

&quot;Panthera spelaea&quot; interacted with both Neanderthals and modern humans, who used their pelts and in the case of the latter, depicted them in artistic works.

==Research history and taxonomy==

In 1774, Zoolithenhöhle cave near the village of Burggaillenreuth in Bavaria, southern Germany was brought to scientific attention by Johan Friedrich Esper, who realised that the bones of extinct animals were present in the cave. In 1810, a fossil skull from the cave was given the scientific name &quot;Felis spelaea&quot; by Georg August Goldfuss. It possibly dates to the Last Glacial Period.

Several anatomical studies of remains of &quot;Panthera spelaea&quot; were conducted during the early-mid 19th century, who found the morphology of the species most similar to lions, tigers and jaguars. A monograph by W. Dawkins and W. Sandford studying &quot;P. spelaea&quot; published in 1868 found that it had closest affinities with the modern lion. At the end of the 19th century, the earliest remains of &quot;P. spelaea&quot; from Siberia were reported by M. Tschersky, who mistook them for those of a tiger. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, &quot;Panthera spelaea&quot; was often regarded as a subspecies of the modern lion, and therefore as &quot;Panthera leo spelaea&quot;. However, other authors considered the cave lion to be more closely related to the tiger, based in part on a comparison of skull shapes, with some proposing that it should be considered a subspecies of the tiger as &quot;Panthera tigris spelaea&quot;. Analysis of cave lion mitochondrial genomes published in 2004 supported the modern lion as the closest relative of &quot;P. spelaea,&quot; with this result being later confirmed by analysis of the nuclear genome. Results from morphological studies showed that it is distinct in cranial and dental anatomy to justify the specific status of &quot;Panthera spelaea&quot;. Results of genetic studies also support this assessment.

In 2001, the subspecies &quot;Panthera spelaea vereshchagini&quot; was proposed for seven specimens found in Siberia and Yukon, which have smaller skulls and teeth than the average &quot;P. spelaea&quot;. Before 2020, genetic analysis using ancient DNA provided no evidence for their distinct subspecific status; DNA signatures from &quot;P. spelaea&quot; from Europe and Alaska were indistinguishable, suggesting one large panmictic population. However, analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences from 31 cave lions showed that they fall into two monophyletic clades. One lived across western Europe and the other was restricted to Beringia during the Pleistocene. For this reason, the Beringian population is considered a distinct subspecies, &quot;P. s. vereshchagini&quot;.

===Evolution===
Lion-like pantherine felids first appeared in the Tanzanian Olduvai Gorge about . These cats dispersed into Eurasia from East Africa around the end of the Early Pleistocene and the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene, giving rise to &quot;Panthera fossilis.&quot; The oldest widely accepted fossils of &quot;P. fossilis&quot; in Europe date to around 700,000-600,000 years ago, such as that from Pakefield in England, with possible older fossils from Western Siberia dating to the late Early Pleistocene, with a 2024 study suggesting a presence in Spain by 1 million years ago during the latest Early Pleistocene around the same age as the Siberian specimen. Different authors considered &quot;Panthera fossils&quot; as either a distinct species ancestral to &quot;P. spelaea&quot;, or as a subspecies of &quot;P. spelaea&quot;. Recent nuclear genomic evidence suggest that interbreeding between modern lions and all Eurasian fossil lions took place up until 500,000 years ago, but by 470,000 years ago, no subsequent interbreeding between the two lineages occurred.

The following cladogram shows the genetic relationship between &quot;P. spelaea&quot; and other pantherine cats.The arrival of &quot;Panthera (spelaea) fossilis&quot; in Europe was part of a faunal turnover event around the Early-Middle Pleistocene transition in which many of the species that characterised the preceeding late Villafranchian became extinct. In the carnivore guild, this notably included the giant hyena &quot;Pachycrocuta&quot; and the sabertooth cat &quot;Megantereon&quot;. Following the arrival of &quot;Panthera (spelaea) fossilis&quot; the lion-sized sabertooth cat &quot;Homotherium&quot; and the &quot;European jaguar&quot; &quot;Panthera gombaszoegensis&quot; became much rarer, ultimately becoming extinct in Europe during the late Middle Pleistocene, with competition with lions suggested to be a likely important factor.

Specimens intermediate between &quot;P. fossilis&quot; and Late Pleistocene &quot;P. spelaea&quot; are referred to as the subspecies &quot;P. s. intermedia&quot;. The transition from &quot;P. fossilis&quot; to Late Pleistocene &quot;P. spelaea&quot; shows significant reduction in body size, as well as changes in skull and tooth morphology. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from fossil lion remains show that the American lion represents a sister group of Late Pleistocene &quot;P. spelaea&quot;, and likely arose when an early &quot;P. spelaea&quot; population became isolated south of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Initially this was suggested to be around 340,000 years ago, but later studies suggested that the split between the two species was probably younger, around 165,000 years ago, consistent with the late first appearance of &quot;P. spelaea&quot; in Eastern Beringia (now Alaska and adjacent regions) during the Illinoian (around 190-130,000 years ago).

==Characteristics==

Carvings and cave paintings of cave lions, which were discovered in the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France, were dated to 15,000 to 17,000 years old. A drawing in the Chauvet cave depicts two cave lions walking together. The one in the foreground is slightly smaller than the one in the background, which has been drawn with a scrotum and without a mane. Such cave paintings suggest that male cave lions completely lacked manes, or at most had very small manes.
Early members of the cave lion lineage assigned to &quot;Panthera&quot; (&quot;spelaea&quot;) &quot;fossilis&quot; during the Middle Pleistocene were considerably larger than individuals of &quot;P. spelaea&quot; from the Last Glacial Period and modern lions, with some of these individuals having an estimated length of , shoulder height of and body mass of , respectively, making them among the largest cats to have ever lived. The Late Pleistocene &quot;Panthera spelaea spelaea&quot; was noticeably smaller though still large relative to living cats, with an estimated length of and shoulder height of , respectively, The species showed a progressive size reduction over the course of the Last Glacial Period up until its extinction, with the last &quot;P. spelaea&quot; populations comparable in size to small-sized modern lions, with a body mass of only , a body length of and shoulder height of respectively.

&quot;P. spelaea&quot; had a relatively longer and narrower muzzle compared to that of the extant lion, with the zygomatic region being strongly arched, with the carnassial teeth having differences in cusp morphology (displaying preparastyles). Like modern lions, females were smaller than males. Compared to the earlier &quot;P.&quot; (&quot;spelaea&quot;) &quot;fossilis&quot;, Late Pleistocene &quot;P. spelaea spelaea&quot; differs (in addition to previously mentioned size differences) in having larger incisor teeth, more narrow and flattened canines, as well narrower upper and lower third and fourth premolars, which display some differences in cusp morphology, with the lower first molar being narrower and more elongate. The orbits (eye sockets) of &quot;P. spelaea spelaea&quot; are also relatively larger and muzzle marginally narrower compared to &quot;P.&quot; (&quot;spelaea&quot;) &quot;fossilis,&quot; with the nasal region also being proportionally narrower, while the postorbital and mastoid regions of the skull are wider, with the tympanic bullae being more inflated.

In 2016, hair found near the Maly Anyuy River was identified as cave lion hair through DNA analysis. Comparison with hair of a modern lion revealed that cave lion hair was probably similar in colour as that of the modern lion, though slightly lighter. In addition, the cave lion is thought to have had a very thick and dense undercoat comprising closed and compressed yellowish-to-white wavy downy hair with a smaller mass of darker-coloured guard hairs, possibly an adaptation to the Ice Age climate. While juveniles fur coat colour was yellowish, adult cave lions are suggested to have had grey fur.

==Distribution and habitat==

During the Last Glacial Period, &quot;P. spelaea&quot; formed a contiguous population across the mammoth steppe, from Western Europe to northwest North America. It was widely distributed in the Iberian Peninsula, Italian Peninsula, Southeast Europe, Great Britain, Central Europe, the East European Plain, the Ural Mountains, most of Northeast Asia (ranging as far south as Northeast China and possibly the Korean peninsula), and across the Bering land bridge into Alaska and Yukon. The cave lion had a wide elevation range, with finds extending up over above sea level in the European Alps and in Buryatia in Northern Asia, though they probably did not occupy mountainous habitats all-year round. 

The cave lion probably inhabited predominantly open habitats such as steppe and grasslands although it would have also have occurred in open woodlands as well. While during the Last Glacial Period it was often associated with cold environments, the species also inhabited temperate environments, such as in Europe during the Last Interglacial/Eemian.

==Paleobiology==

=== Ecology ===

&quot;P. spelaea&quot; was one of the keystone species of the mammoth steppe, being one of the main apex predators alongside the gray wolf, cave hyena and brown bear. Large amounts of bones belonging to &quot;P. spelaea&quot; were excavated in caves, where bones of cave hyena, cave bear and Paleolithic artefacts were also found. Despite their common name, &quot;cave lions&quot; probably only infrequently if ever used caves, and were present in regions where caves were absent. Some of these accumulations of cave lion bones in cave hyena dens have been attributed to confrontations between cave hyenas and cave lions over carcasses, with the remains of cave lions killed in these confrontations subsequently transported to the dens.

Isotopic analyses of bone collagen samples extracted from remains in Europe and East Beringia indicate that reindeer were particularly prominent in the diet of cave lions in these regions during the Last Glacial Period. Cave lions also seem to have opportunistically preyed on the cubs of cave bears, with adult cave bears also likely being targeted at least on occasion. Isotopic analysis of other European specimens suggests a diet including wild horse, woolly mammoth and cave bears for these individuals. It may have sought out hibernating bears in montane caves as a food source during the winter. Bite marks found on the bones of straight-tusked elephants in Neumark Nord, Germany, dating to the Last Interglacial, have been suggested to be the result of scavenging by cave lions.

Other possible prey species were giant deer, red deer, muskox, aurochs, wisent, steppe bison, and young woolly rhinoceros. It likely competed for prey with the European leopards, cave hyenas, brown bears and grey wolves in Eurasia, along with short-faced bears, &quot;Homotherium&quot;, and Beringian wolves in Beringia. 

=== Social behavior ===
Whether or not cave lions were gregarious like modern lions is unclear. Some experts, such as Guthrie argue that the cave lion lived solitarily or only in small family groups, based primarily on the lack of manes (which are highly important to the social hierarchy of modern lions) depicted on Paleolithic cave art. This argument was criticized by Yamaguichi and colleagues, they argued that the emergence of group living in lions probably predates the split between cave lions and modern lions and the evolution of manes in modern lions. On the other hand, gregariousness has been argued via sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism within canine dimensions in cave lions suggests that their sexual dimorphism was either similar lions, and in evolutionary context may suggests they lived in groups according to Yamaguichi and colleagues. Boeskorov and their colleagues suggested that the more extreme sexual dimorphism seen in cave lions could suggest that they lived in larger prides. However they admitted that there isn’t enough evidence to conclude on their social structure. On the contrary, Valkenburgh and Sacco warned that sexual dimorphism isn’t a reliable way to determine group behavior, as leopards are also very sexually dimorphic in canine dimensions but live a solitary lifestyle.

Isotopic analysis on cave lions by Hervé Bocherens and colleagues lead them to suggest that cave lions may have been solitary, due to cave lions shifting their diets after the disappearance of cave hyenas, carcasses being consumed the cave hyenas as well, suggests they were at a competitive disadvantage, and the scattering of isotopic data between individuals. Within mountain ranges and higher altitude environments, cave lions may have also been solitary or hunt in mating pairs, much like today’s lions. Lions tend to hunt in prides in altitudes below 1,500 meters, but within higher altitudes, they tend to be solitary or hunt in mating pairs. This proposed behavior for cave lions is further supported by the ratios of males and females from Moravian Karst being 1:1. 

Cave lion cubs appear to have lived in dens during their earliest stages of life, like modern lion cubs and were likely solely raised by females, like living &quot;Panthera&quot; species.

== Relationship with humans ==

Cave lions were hunted and their pelts exploited in Europe by Neanderthals during the Middle Paleolithic, and during the Upper Paleolithic by modern humans in Spain as evidenced in the La Garma site dating to the Magdalenian. Modern humans also drew cave paintings of cave lions, engraved their likeness on bones and created sculptures of them, including the famous anthropomorphic lion-man (&quot;Löwenmensch)&quot; figure from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave in Germany dating to around 41-35,000 years ago with the body of a human and the head of a lion. Cave lion canines with perforated holes may have been worn as personal ornaments. Decorated stones with engravings representing cave lions have been found in southern Italy.

== Extinction ==

Radiocarbon dating suggests that the species went extinct approximately simultaneously across its range during the last few thousand years of the Late Pleistocene, around 14-15,000 years ago, possibly surviving around 1000 years later in the far east North American portion of its range. This timing roughly corresponds to the onset of the Bølling–Allerød Interstadial warm period and the consequent collapse of the mammoth steppe ecosystem. The precise cause of its extinction is unclear, but possibly involved environmental change from open habitats to closed forests, changes in prey abundance, as well as human impact, though it is difficult to distentangle the precise causes of its extinction. Competition with wolves may have been an important factor in its extinction. Cave lions appear to have undergone a population bottleneck that considerably reduced their genetic diversity between 47,000 and 18,000 years ago, probably driven at least in part by climatic instability.

== Mummified specimens ==
In 2008, a well-preserved mature cave lion specimen was unearthed near the Maly Anyuy River in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, which still retained some clumps of hair. 
In 2015, two frozen cave lion cubs, estimated to be between 25,000 and 55,000 years old, were discovered close to the Uyandina River in Yakutia, Siberia in permafrost.
Research results indicate that the cubs were likely barely a week old at the time of their deaths, as their milk teeth had not fully erupted. Further evidence suggests the cubs were hidden at a den site until they were strong enough to follow their mother back to the pride, as with modern lions. Researchers believe that the cubs were trapped and killed by a landslide, and that the absence of oxygen underground hindered their decomposition and allowed the cubs to be preserved in such good condition. A second expedition to the site where the cubs were found was planned for 2016, in hopes of finding either the remains of a third cub or possibly the cubs&#x27; mother.

In 2017, another frozen specimen, thought to be a lion cub, was found in Yakutia on the banks of the Tirekhtyakh River (), a tributary of the Indigirka River. This male cub was thought to be slightly older than the 2015 cubs at the time of its death; it is estimated to have been around one and a half to two months. In 2018, another preserved carcass of a cub was found in a location away. It was considered to be around a month old when it died approximately 50,000 years ago, and presumed to be a sibling of the male cub. However, carbon dating showed them to have lived about 15,000 years apart, with the female estimated to have lived 28,000 years ago, and the male 43,448 years ago. Both cubs were well preserved, albeit with a few damages, with the female possibly being the &quot;best preserved&quot; animal discovered from the Ice age.

<doc id="1219881" wikidata="Q2872854" url="?curid=1219881" title="Ontario Highway 410">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 410, also known as Highway 410 and colloquially as the four-ten, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects Highways 401 and 403 to Brampton. North of Brampton, the commuter freeway ends and the route becomes Highway 10, which continues north through Caledon as a four-lane undivided highway. The route is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police and has a speed limit of .

Highway 410 was built along the alignment of Heart Lake Road south of Bovaird Drive, while north of Bovaird Drive it was built along a new alignment. The highway was designated in 1978 between Highway 401 and Bovaird Drive (later Highway 7), though it was only two lanes wide and had at-grade intersections. It was widened throughout the 1980s and completed as a freeway in 1991. In 2003, construction began on a northward extension of the freeway that was completed in November 2009 which connected directly to Highway 10. Prior to being downloaded to municipal authorities, Highway 10 had continued further south through Brampton and Mississauga running parallel to Highway 410.

== Route description ==
Highway 410 starts at a massive stack interchange with Highway 401 and Highway 403. Highway 403&#x27;s eastern segment which runs from the south and west through central Mississauga splits up into a collector-express system at Eglinton Avenue, and while the express lanes continue directly to Highway 401 express lanes east of the 401-403-410 interchange, just north of the Matheson Boulevard overpasses the collector lanes effectively continue northward as Highway 410 after exit/entry ramps linking to Highway 401 collector lanes.

Maintaining a straight north-westward course, it passes beneath Courtney Park Drive and Derry Road, with a slight jog to the right between the two underpasses. The freeway then meets Highway 407 at a cloverstack interchange as it crosses into Brampton and passes beneath a hydro corridor. Veering to the left, the freeway continues through industrialized areas and returns to its northwest–southeast orientation. It passes beneath Steeles Avenue East, following alongside the alignment of Heart Lake Road (now mostly broken up into segments), and later Queen Street East, the former Highway 7, now Peel Regional Road 107. Until it was decommissioned across the Greater Toronto Area, Highway 7 was concurrent between Queen Street East and Bovaird Drive. Passing north of Queen Street, the highway leaves the industrial area and passes through residential areas in an open cut until Bovaird Drive East.

The more recently completed extension begins at this point, as the highway returns to ground level and passes to the west of Trinity Common and departs from the Heart Lake Road alignment passing near the Heart Lake Conservation Area.
As it passes beneath Mayfield Road, the highway makes a sharp turn to the west and descends through the Etobicoke Creek valley.
After rising back to level ground, it curves north, passing beneath Valleywood Drive. The central concrete median barrier and high-mast lighting end as the freeway&#x27;s opposing carriageways merge, becoming Highway 10 which continues north to Orangeville, Shelburne and eventually Owen Sound.

== History ==
Planning for highway 410 began during the late 1960s as a result of the rapid suburbanization of Brampton. On May 25, 1965, the Department of Highways (DHO) unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study. The plan designated several new highway corridors and widening projects through Peel and Halton, including Highway 10.
However, it did not include a truck bypass that was desired by Brampton city council. In 1969, then Brampton Mayor William H. Brydon would encourage the DHO to construct this bypass utilizing Heart Lake Road through the city, and announced the plans at his final city council meeting as mayor, claiming that it may be known as the Brampton Expressway and would connect with Highway 401.
Successor Jim Archdekin announced in the new year that he would meet with highways minister George Gomme to discuss the route of the bypass.
The DHO studied the corridor over the next several months before releasing a report in late August.

Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who was known as &quot;Brampton Billy&quot;, formally initiated the construction of Highway 410 along the Heart Lake Road corridor during his administration.
Prior to the construction of Highway 410, Heart Lake Road was flanked by the industrial lands of Brampton and Bramalea north of Steeles Avenue, which required the highway to follow the road&#x27;s alignment to avoid demolition of buildings. Between Steeles and Highway 401 was agricultural lands, allowing for the highway to constructed on a separate alignment to the west. In 1975, construction began on the widening of Highway 401 between Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) and Highway 427 from four to six lanes. On Highway 401 between Kennedy Road and Dixie Road, while the first phase of a large interchange was being built primarily for the upcoming Mississauga segment of Highway 403, ramps were also constructed with the new Brampton freeway to allow access to Highway 401 east of that junction (a directional ramp from Highway 401 westbound and a loop ramp to Highway 401 eastbound). However, the fledgling Brampton freeway did not yet have links to Highway 403 nor Highway 401 west of that junction. Heart Lake Road though Brampton was rebuilt over the next several years, and reopened as a two lane expressway on November 15, 1978. It was at this point that the road was designated Highway 410 as far north as Queen Street.

The construction of Highway 410 resulted in changes to the surrounding street network: The intact southern section of Heart Lake Road south of Steeles Avenue was severed from the northern section after the highway largely subsumed the latter. This portion was renamed Tomken Road (as a continuation of a street linked to its southern terminus when a jog was eliminated), and a diversion was constructed by the City of Brampton to connect it with Steeles further east. The West Drive Extension, between Orenda Road and Steeles, was constructed in 1983 to link with the north end of the new diversion.

Construction to twin the highway began in 1983, following the completion of a culvert over the east branch of the Etobicoke Creek;
the interchange with Clark Boulevard was built at the same time.
The following year, contracts were awarded to build the two structures over the Canadian National Railway south of Orenda Road,
as well as an interchange at Queen Street; the former was completed by the end of the year while the latter took until late 1985. Construction of the interchange at Bovaird Drive began in 1985 and was completed the following summer.
With the construction of each interchange, the future northbound lanes of the freeway were constructed and opened to two-way traffic. By 1988, two lanes were open between Steeles Avenue and Bovaird Drive.

In 1987, construction began south of the future Highway 407 interchange, expanding the two lane Heart Lake Road to a six lane freeway. In addition, work began on the future southbound lanes north of Steeles Avenue.
In 1990, the Courtney Park Drive overpass was widened from two to four lanes as ramps were added to connect to the freeway south of it. By mid-1991, Highway 410 was complete from north of Highway 401 to Bovaird Drive, and work was underway to complete the junction, with an eleven-span semi-directional flyover ramp from Highway 401 eastbound to Highway 410 northbound, while the flyover ramp from Highway 410 southbound to Highway 401 eastbound replaced the existing loop ramp.
The interchange with Highway 401 was expanded alongside the widening of that highway to a collector-express system and opened to traffic ramp-by-ramp beginning August 28, 1990 and continuing through the end of the year.

In the fall of 1991, alongside the widening of Highway 410 into a full freeway, construction began on the connecting ramps between Highway 403 and Highway 410 that pass under the existing Highway 401 collector lane structures within the space vacated by the removal of the Highway 410 southbound to Highway 401 eastbound loop ramp. In the vacant right-of-way between the Highway 401 collectors, overpasses were constructed for the Highway 401 express lanes that would flow under the recently completed flyover ramps between Highway 401 eastbound and Highway 410.
The link opened on November 2, 1992, at a cost of $7.3 million.

As completed to its initial terminus in mid-1991, Highway 410 ended just north of the interchange with Bovaird Drive, as the opposing carriageways merged under the western span of the Bovaird Drive overpass (although separated by a Jersey barrier for some distance) and after an S-curve the freeway transitioned to an arterial street and continued north as Heart Lake Road.

=== Extension ===

The extension beyond Bovaird Drive to Hurontario Street was conceived as part of the ultimate plan for Highway 410 when it was under construction in 1982.
It would take until 2003 for construction to begin.
Planning for the freeway began with the submitting of an Environmental Assessment by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) in October 1995. The assessment was approved without a hearing by the Minister of Environment and Energy on March 5, 1997.
The next several years were spent on engineering and design. The new section, planned and built as a four lane freeway, was constructed on a new alignment in order to bypass the Heart Lake Conservation Area. It was completed in phases: initially to the new eastward extension of Sandalwood Parkway, later to Mayfield Road and finally to Highway 10 north of Sandalwood.

Premier of Ontario Ernie Eves officially announced the extension on June 23, 2003; construction subsequently began on the first phase. Heart Lake Road, which had transitioned directly into the existing freeway since mid-1991, was realigned to a new intersection west of Bovaird Drive&#x27;s interchange with the freeway, so this would allow the ramps between Bovaird Drive and the freeway extension to be built. 
On May 15, 2006, construction began on the second phase between Sandalwood Parkway and Mayfield Drive. The first two phases were built by Dufferin Construction and opened together in mid–late 2007; the northbound lanes were opened by the beginning of September and the southbound lanes by the end of the month. Upon its opening, trucks were prohibited from driving along it due to concerns of them travelling on the two lane Mayfield Road; this ban has since been lifted.

Construction on the third phase between Mayfield Road and Highway 10 began in August 2007. This resulted in Hurontario Street becoming discontinuous as it was split into two segments, with the northern end of the southern portion realigned so it defaults to Valleywood Boulevard (which leads to a new residential community), with a new interchange connecting to the freeway extension that soon transitions into the northern portion of Hurontario Street (which also assumes the provincial Highway 10 designation) as it crosses into Caledon. The freeway extension was completed and opened to traffic on November 16, 2009, directly connecting Highway 410 and Highway 10 for the first time (prior to provincial downloading in 1997, the Highway 10 routing ran further south along Hurontario where it was parallel to Highway 410 in Brampton and Mississauga). Additional work continued in the months that followed to clean up the land surrounding the new freeway. The bypassed portion of Hurontario Street, that connected the northern and southern segments and included a temporary diversion to facilitate the construction, was later retained while being renamed Hutchinson Farm Lane and made accessible via a new intersection from the southern segment of Hurontario Street.

=== Widening with HOV lanes ===

On September 9, 2014, the MTO announced that Highway 410 would be widened to ten lanes from south of Highway 401 to Queen Street in Brampton by 2018. A C$156.7 million contract was awarded to Aecon Construction to expand the freeway by adding one general purpose and one High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction. A northbound collector lane will also be implemented between the Highway 401 on-ramps and the realigned off-ramp to Courtneypark Drive. In addition, two new ramps will be built at the partial interchange with Highway 401 and Highway 403, a directional ramp from Highway 401 eastbound to Highway 403 southbound and a loop ramp from Highway 403 northbound to Highway 401 westbound, thereby providing access to and from all directions.
One new lane in each direction was opened in late 2017: a northbound lane between Courtney Park and south of Queen Street on October 31, and a southbound lane between Queen Street and Highway 401 on November 28.
In November 2018, both the southbound and northbound HOV Lane opened through the route. The southbound HOV was opened several weeks ahead of the northbound HOV lane.

As a result of a study in 2018, the Courtneypark Drive partial-access interchange is being expanded into a full interchange (Parclo A2) as of 2020. The overpass is being widened, ramps are being added to provide access to and from the section of Highway 410 north of that junction, and a short southbound collector lane is being implemented between Derry Road and Courtneypark Drive due to the close proximity of these interchanges.

== Future ==
The segment of the freeway between Mayfield Road and Highway 10 that opened on November16, 2009 would be bypassed by a new extension that would meet the proposed Highway413 at a freeway-to-freeway interchange.

On April 30, 2024, the Ontario provincial government confirmed it will start constructing Highway 413 in 2025 after coming to an agreement with the Canadian federal government. Highway 413 would be the proposed northern terminus of Highway 410.

<text>The Communist League of Austria () was a pro-China communist group in Austria. The KBÖ was founded on 6 August 1976 in Vienna.

The first congress of KBÖ was held in January 1978. Walter Lindner was reelected as the Central Committee Secretary.

KBÖ published the &quot;Klassenkampf&quot; (biweekly, 1978 weekly) and the theoretical journal &quot;Kommunist&quot; (monthly).

KBÖ strongly opposed the Soviet Union, denouncing it as &quot;social-imperialist&quot;. The KBÖ organized rallies outside the Soviet embassy in Vienna.

In 1980 KBÖ split into two factions, which both continued to use the name KBÖ.

<doc id="1219902" wikidata="Q804569" url="?curid=1219902" title="Bala, Ontario">
<text>Bala is a compact rural community in the township municipality of Muskoka Lakes, District Municipality of Muskoka in Central Ontario, Canada. It is well-known for the Bala Falls, the source of the Moon River, which flows from Lake Muskoka to the Georgian Bay.

It is considered one of the hubs of cottage country located north of Toronto. Thus, its year-round population of several hundred is increased by thousands of seasonal residents and weekend day-trippers during summer months. It is known as the Cranberry Capital of Ontario, as the province&#x27;s largest cranberry farms, Muskoka Lakes Farm and Winery (formerly Johnston&#x27;s Cranberry Marsh) and the former Iroquois Cranberry Growers (closed in 2017), are located nearby. It was once the smallest incorporated town in Canada until it was amalgamated into Muskoka Lakes Township.

==History==
Bala was settled by Thomas Burgess in 1868. Thomas Burgess opened a sawmill and store to serve the area&#x27;s scattered settlers. Thomas Burgess named it after the town of Bala in Wales with which it is officially twinned. Located on the Canadian Shield, it proved unsuitable for farming, and its fortunes declined as logging became less economically viable. Railway connections helped to re-establish the village as a popular location for summer resorts.

In 1914, the town incorporated with Burgess&#x27;s son as the first mayor, making it the smallest incorporated town in Canada.

==Geography==

Located at the west end of Lake Muskoka, at the foot of Bala Bay, the prominent geographical feature of the town are the many bare outcroppings of the Canadian Shield. Carved out of the Shield is Bala Falls, the only outlet for Lake Muskoka. That allows water to empty from the Muskoka River watershed into the Moon River and eventually Georgian Bay; however, the falls were at a low elevation and for many years the water levels of Lake Muskoka were known to fluctuate eight or nine feet every season, between the spring runoffs and the late fall. That led to many navigation problems both for the timber industry and the settlers. In 1873, a control dam was built at the Bala Falls, which still exists in an upgraded form and is known as the North Falls. However, the dam worked too well and led to flooding, which forced the construction soon after of a large flood control dam and channel, known today as the South Falls.

A further channel north of the North Falls was created in the 1880s to power a sawmill and later reused as the water intake channel for a hydroelectric station built in 1917. The station, operated by the Bala Electric Light and Power Company to supply electricity as far as MacTier and Port Carling was retired in 1957 but then returned to active use as a small remotely-operated station in the 1990s. It remains in use today.

A second station operated between the North and South Falls from 1924 to 1957 but was later demolished because it was uneconomical. A new generating station is being built at the site, a project that caused much local controversy.

==Transportation==

Bala was well connected and once was connected only to other Muskoka communities via the steamship lines that plied the Muskoka Lakes. The &quot;Cherokee, Islander&quot; and &quot;Segwun&quot; were frequently seen at the dock below the CPR station, and the &quot;Ahmic&quot; was based on the other side of Bala Bay in Torrance. Steamships have been unable to visit Bala since 1964, when the swing bridge at Bala Park Island was sealed shut. A portion of the former steamer dock remains, maintained for many decades by the MNR and today by the Township of Muskoka Lakes.

In 1907 the Canadian Pacific Railway opened a prominent &quot;summer&quot; station at the harbour, complete with freight elevator (a &quot;winter&quot; station was located a half-mile north). There was also a seasonal Grand Trunk Railway (later CN) station across the bay on Bala Park Island. In 1927, six CPR train routes each way served Bala, four on a daily basis. With the influx of many American cottagers, Bala even became a Customs Port of Entry. The Bala Weekend trains continued to serve the tourists until 1963, when the station was demolished.

The settlement-era Musquosh Road from Gravenhurst arrived in the 1880s and fed further development after the heyday of the railways as the route was eventually upgraded from a rough trail into first the Rama Road, then the provincial Highway 69 (later renumbered to Highway 169, then to Muskoka Road 169). A postwar bypass was created for the highway to avoid the original Musquosh Road bridge and single-lane rail underpass at the South Falls, but that also had the effect of removing traffic from Bala&#x27;s former main street south of the Falls, severely impacting businesses on that section and concentrating commercial activity along the highway north of the Falls.

==Services==
In 1971, the town was amalgamated with other townships and municipalities to form the Township of Muskoka Lakes; the Chamber of Commerce office is in Bala; other civic functions are located in Port Carling.

Bala was the location of the first detachment of Ontario Provincial Police in 1921. A small modern station remains just north of the main part of town (run by the Bracebridge detachment part-time). The Canada Post Post Office has been relocated to share space with the police station.

==Accommodations==
Until changes in transportation and development led to most seasonal visitors staying in private cottages, Bala offered summer lodging at a large number of tourist resorts over the decades. For example, Windsor Park is on the site of the former Windsor Hotel. Located on River Street were Bala Cozy Cabins and Roselawn Lodge. The Bala Bay Inn (formerly the Swastika Inn until a postwar name change) remained as an active hotel until 2016. Built in 1910, it is Muskoka&#x27;s oldest brick hotel. The original tin ceiling and mahogany staircase still grace the front lobby.

==Culture and entertainment==
Since 1942, under various management and names, the community and the surrounding area was offered live musical entertainment. In the 1940s and &#x27;50s, Big Bands like Mart Kenney, Cab Calloway, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Woody Herman and Louis Armstrong played at Dunn&#x27;s Pavilion. Since the 1960s, rock musicians like David Wilcox, Kim Mitchell, The Ramones, April Wine, Burton Cummings and Jeff Healey played at The KEE to Bala. More recently, bands such as Metric, Sum 41, The Tragically Hip, The Sam Roberts Band, Hinder, Finger Eleven, Three Days Grace, Sloan, Tim Hicks, Hedley and Theory of a Deadman have graced the stage at The KEE to Bala. In the 1980s, Bala and Port Carling were also featured in a skit by The Frantics on &quot;Boot to the Head&quot;. In the skit, a man on his way to Bala bores his companion to distraction in part by endlessly enumerating the communities&#x27; features. Most recently Bala is home to The New Actor&#x27;s Colony professional Theatre company who perform seasonally in the summer in the local curling rink.

Lucy Maud Montgomery, author of the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; books, visited Bala in 1922. The area made a sufficient impression on her that she based the novel &quot;The Blue Castle&quot; on the area, her only novel not set in Prince Edward Island. Based on the connection to a beloved Canadian author, Bala&#x27;s Museum, a privately run museum featuring Montgomery, was opened in the 1990s.

Bala hosts the Bala Cranberry Festival annually on the weekend after Canadian Thanksgiving, attracting thousands of people to the town.

Bala is home to Muskoka Lakes Winery, the Muskoka region&#x27;s only winery, which specializes in cranberry and other fruit wines.

Once a week in the summer months, students from a nearby water ski school perform aquatic stunts for audiences at a local park. Students form pyramids, jump obstacles, ski barefoot, and occasionally ski while they wear alpine skis.

Bala Bay remains a sailing hotspot in Muskoka due to its excellent and consistent winds. A local sailing club organizes Saturday races.

<doc id="1219903" wikidata="Q221385" url="?curid=1219903" title="Common European Framework of Reference for Languages">
<text>The European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment, abbreviated in English as CEFR, CEF, or CEFRL, is a guideline used to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across Europe and, increasingly, in other countries. The CEFR is also intended to make it easier for educational institutions and employers to evaluate the language qualifications of candidates for education admission or employment. Its main aim is to provide a method of teaching, and assessing that applies to all languages in Europe.

The CEFR was established by the Council of Europe between 1986 and 1989 as part of the &quot;Language Learning for European Citizenship&quot; project. In November 2001, a European Union Council Resolution recommended using the CEFR to set up systems of validation of language ability. The six reference levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) are becoming widely accepted as the European standard for grading an individual&#x27;s language proficiency.

As of 2024, &quot;localized&quot; versions of the CEFR exist in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico and Canada. &quot;CEFR is a suitable and credible benchmark for English standards in Malaysia.&quot; This is how, for example, the Malaysian government wrote about it.

==Development==

An intergovernmental symposium in 1991 titled &quot;Transparency and Coherence in Language Learning in Europe: Objectives, Evaluation, Certification&quot; held by the Swiss Federal Authorities in the Swiss municipality of Rüschlikon found the need for a common European framework for languages to improve the recognition of language qualifications and help teachers co-operate. A project followed to develop language-level classifications for certification to be recognised across Europe.
A preliminary version of the Manual for Relating Language Examinations to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) was published in 2003. This draft version was piloted in a number of projects, which included linking a single test to the CEFR, linking suites of exams at different levels and national studies by exam boards and research institutes. Practitioners and academics shared their experiences at a colloquium in Cambridge in 2007 and the pilot case studies and findings were published in Studies in Language Testing (SiLT). The findings from the pilot projects then informed the Manual revision project from 2008 to 2009.

The Council of Europe&#x27;s authoring team emphasized that the CEFR was not written primarily as a framework for assessment and test development. Similarly, linguists such as Alderson, Quetz and others criticized the lack of system in the descriptors and the context-free nature of these. Other critics invoked the danger of a rigid &quot;pan-European&quot; language testing system. Brian North, one of the authors of the CEFR team, addressed such criticisms in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article in 2004:
==Theoretical background==

The CEFR divides general competences in &quot;knowledge&quot;, &quot;skills&quot;, and &quot;existential competence&quot; with particular communicative competences in &quot;linguistic competence&quot;, &quot;sociolinguistic competence&quot; and &quot;pragmatic competence&quot;. This division does not exactly match previously well-known notions of &quot;communicative competence&quot;, but correspondences among them can be made.

The CEFR has three principal dimensions: language activities, the domains in which the language activities occur, and the competencies on which a person draws when they engage in them.

=== Language activities ===
The CEFR distinguishes four kinds of language activities: reception (listening and reading), production (spoken and written), interaction (spoken and written) and mediation (translating and interpreting).

=== Domains ===
General and particular communicative competencies are developed by producing or receiving texts in various contexts under various conditions and constraints. These contexts correspond to various sectors of social life that the CEFR calls domains. Four broad domains are distinguished: educational, occupational, public and personal. These largely correspond to register.

=== Competencies ===
A language user can develop various degrees of competence in each of these domains and to help describe them, the CEFR has provided a set of six &quot;Common Reference Levels&quot; (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2).

==Common reference levels==
The Common European Framework divides learners into three broad divisions that can each be further divided into two levels; for each level, it describes what a learner is supposed to be able to do in reading, listening, speaking and writing. The following table indicates these levels.

These descriptors can apply to any of the languages spoken in Europe and there are translations in many languages.

==Relationship with duration of learning process==
Educational bodies for various languages have offered estimates for the amount of study needed to reach levels in the relevant language.
==Certification and teaching ecosystem enabled by the CEFR==
Multiple organisations have been created to serve as an umbrella for language schools and certification businesses that claim compatibility with the CEFR. For example, the European Association for Language Testing and Assessment (EALTA) is an initiative funded by the European Community to promote the CEFR and best practices in delivering professional language training. The Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) is a consortium of academic organisations that aims at standardising assessment methods. Eaquals (Evaluation and Accreditation of Quality in Language Services) is an international association of institutions and organisations involved in language education, active throughout Europe and following the CEFR.

In France, the Ministry for Education has created a government-mandated certificate called CLES, which formalises the use of the CEFR in language teaching programmes in French higher education institutions.

In Germany, Telc, a non-profit agency, is the federal government&#x27;s exclusive partner for language tests taken at the end of the integration courses for migrants, following the CEFR standards.

==Comparisons with other scales==
===General scales===
====ACTFL====
The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has published a one-directional alignment table of levels according to its ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines and the CEFR levels. It is based on the work of the ACTFL-CEFR Alignment Conferences that started in 2010. Generally, the ACTFL is stricter with regard to receptive skills than productive skills, compared to the CEFR. The following table may not be read as an indication of what ACTFL level follows from taking a CEFR-aligned test.

For convenience, the following abbreviations will be used for the ACTFL levels:
* NL/NM/NH – Novice Low/Mid/High
* IL/IM/IH – Intermediate Low/Mid/High
* AL/AM/AH – Advanced Low/Mid/High
* S – Superior
* D – Distinguished

Similar correspondence has been proposed for the other direction (test aligned to CEFR) in a panel discussion at the Osaka University of Foreign Studies by one of the coauthors of the CEFR, Brian North. He stated that a &quot;sensible hypothesis&quot; would be for C2 to correspond to &quot;Distinguished,&quot; C1 to &quot;Superior,&quot; B2 to &quot;Advanced-mid&quot; and B1 to &quot;Intermediate-high&quot; in the ACTFL system.

This agrees with a table published by the American University Center of Provence giving the following correspondences according to &quot;estimated equivalencies by certified ACTFL administrator&quot;:

The following table summarises three earlier proposed equivalences between CEFR and ACTFL. Some of them only refer to one activity (e.g. speaking).

====ILR====
The French Academy Baltimore suggests the following different equivalence:

A study by Buck, Papageorgiou and Platzek addresses the correspondence between the difficulty of test items under the CEFR and ILR standards. The most common ILR levels for items of given CEFR difficulty were as follows:
* Reading—A1: 1, A2: 1, B1: 1+, B2: 2+, C1: 3
* Listening—A1: 0+/1, A2: 1, B1: 1+, B2: 2, C1: 2+ (at least)

====Canada====
As Canada increasingly uses the CEFR, Larry Vandergrift of the University of Ottawa has proposed Canadian adoption of the CEFR in his report &quot;Proposal for a Common Framework of Reference for Languages for Canada&quot; published by Heritage Canada. This report contains a comparison of the CEFR to other standards in use in Canada and proposes an equivalence table.

The resulting correspondence between the ILR and ACTFL scales disagrees with the generally accepted one. The ACTFL standards were developed so that Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and Superior would correspond to 0/0+, 1/1+, 2/2+ and 3/3+, respectively on the ILR scale. Also, the ILR and NB OPS scales do not correspond despite the fact that the latter was modelled on the former.

A 2007 document by Macdonald and Vandergrift estimates the following correspondences (for oral ability) between the Public Service Commission levels and the CEFR levels:

Language schools may also propose their own equivalence tables. For example, the Vancouver English Centre provides a comprehensive equivalence table between the various forms of the TOEFL test, the Cambridge exam, the VEC level system, and the CEFR.

=== Language-specific scales ===

==Difficulty in aligning the CEFR with teaching programmes==
Language schools and certificate bodies evaluate their equivalences against the framework. Differences in estimation have been found to exist, for example, with the same level on the PTE A, TOEFL, and IELTS, and is a cause of debate between test producers.

==Non-Western areas and languages==
The CEFR, initially developed to ease human mobility and economic growth within the highly multilingual European Union, has since influenced and been borrowed by various other areas.

=== Non-Western learners ===
In Japan, the adoption of CEFR has been encouraged by academics, institutional actors (MEXT), politicians, business associations, and by learners themselves. Adoption in Malaysia has also been documented. In Vietnam, adoption of the CEFR has been connected to recent changes in English language policy, efforts to reform higher education, orientation toward economic opportunities and a tendency for administrators to look outwards for domestic solutions.

Noriyuki (2009) observes the &quot;mechanical&quot; reuse of the European framework and concepts by Japanese teachers of mostly Western languages, missing the recontextualisation part: the need to adapt the conceptual vocabulary to the local language and to adapt the framework to the local public, its language and practices.

Around 2005, the Osaka University of Foreign Studies developed a CEFR-inspired project for its 25 foreign languages, with a transparent and common evaluation approach. While major languages had long had well-defined tools for the Japanese public, able to guide teachers in teaching and performing assessments in a methodic way, this project pushed the adoption of similar practices to smaller languages, as requested by students.

In late 2006–2010, the Keio University led the ambitious CEFR-inspired Action Oriented Plurilingual Language Learning Project to favour multi-campus and inter-language cooperation in creating teaching materials and assessment systems from child to university levels. Since 2015, the &quot;Research on Plurilinguistic and Pluricultural Skill Development in Integrated Foreign Language Education&quot; has followed up.

=== Non-European languages ===
The framework was translated into Chinese in 2008. In 2011, French sinologist Joël Bellassen suggests the CEFR together with its metalanguage could and should be adapted to distant languages such as Chinese, with the necessity to adapt and extend it with relevant concepts proper to the new language and its learners. Various efforts on adaptation to Chinese have been made.

==Companion Volume==

The CEFR Companion Volume (CEFR-CV) is an extension and update of the original CEFR. It provides new and extended illustrative descriptors covering a wider range of communicative activities, including online interaction, mediation, plurilingual/pluricultural competence, and sign language competencies. It also introduces various communicative language activities and strategies. Additionally, existing descriptors have been refined to more accurately reflect the nuances of language use and to address any identified gaps since the original CEFR publication. The Companion Volume also emphasizes inclusivity, and includes descriptors for online interaction. The Council of Europe gave the new version of the CEFR (published in 2020) the title &quot;Companion Volume&quot;, as it quotes central passages from the original CEFR and explains them. At the same time, it redefines the underlying construct (i.e. &quot;language as social action&quot;). 

===&quot;Mediation&quot;===
In the 2001 edition, &quot;mediation&quot; meant translating, interpreting, summarizing, reporting, etc. As such, it had become part of the foreign language curricula of secondary schools in Germany, Austria and other European states. In the CEFR-CV, however, mediation now refers to processes employed by multiple language users when jointly constructing meaning.
A distinction is made between &quot;Cognitive Mediation&quot; and &quot;Relational Mediation&quot;. The scales on Cognitive Mediation describe the process of facilitating access to knowledge and concepts. In contrast, the scales under Relational Mediation focus on the processes of establishing and maintaining interpersonal relationships to create a cooperative environment.

=== No native speaker standards ===
Unlike in 2001, all references to a native speaker standard have disappeared in the CEFR-CV. In the 2001 edition, the use of &#x27;native speaker&#x27; sometimes led to misunderstandings. In the CEFR-CV, pronunciation at C2, for example, is described as follows:Can employ the full range of phonological features in the target language with a high level of control – including prosodic features such as word and sentence stress, rhythm and intonation – so that the finer points of their message are clear and precise. Intelligibility and effective conveyance and enhancement of meaning are not affected in any way by features of accent that may be retained from other language(s).

=== Descriptor scales ===

The CEFR&#x27;s 54 descriptor scales had been reduced to a single scale, i.e. the &quot;Global Scale&quot;. This misunderstanding is documented by the use of a six-step staircase to illustrate the competence model suggested by the CEFR. In the CEFR-CV, the descriptor scales are intended to describe context-specific, differentiated competence profiles.

<doc id="1219905" wikidata="Q5080622" url="?curid=1219905" title="Charles Manigault Morris">
<text>Charles Manigault Morris (May 7, 1820 – March 22, 1895) was an officer in the United States Navy and later in the Confederate States Navy. Morris was a descendant of several of the most prominent Northern and Southern families in colonial America.

==Early life==
Morris was born in Adams Run, South Carolina on May 7, 1820. He was the youngest son of Col. Lewis Morris (1785–1863) of New York and his wife Elizabeth (née Manigault) Morris (1785–1822) of South Carolina, who married in 1807. Among his siblings was Gabriella Manigault Morris (wife of John Mease Butler and sister-in-law of Pierce Mease Butler), Margaret Ann Morris (wife of John Berkley Grimball), Henry Manigault Morris (who married M. Georgia Edwards), and Richard Lewis Morris (who married Anne Elizabeth Dunwoodie). In 1822, when Charles was just two years old, his mother and older brother Lewis were killed during a hurricane on Sullivan&#x27;s Island. In 1837, his father remarried to Amarinthia Lowndes, a daughter of James Lowndes and granddaughter of Gov. Rawlins Lowndes. From his father&#x27;s second marriage, he had three half-siblings, including Lewis Morris (b. 1842), who lived in Paris. Although they lived in the South, his father maintained control of Morris family property around Morrisania in New York.

His paternal grandparents were Maj. and Brevet Lt. Col. of the Continental Army Lewis V. Morris (eldest son of Continental Congressman and signer of the Declaration of Independence Lewis Morris who was the third and last Lord of Morrisania Manor) and Ann B. (née Elliott) Morris (a sister-in-law of U.S. Representative Daniel Huger). His maternal grandparents were architect Gabriel Manigault (a son of Peter Manigault, the wealthiest person in British North America in 1770) and Margaret (née Izard) Manigault (a daughter of Continental Congressman and U.S. Senator from South Carolina Ralph Izard). He was also distant cousin of Confederate General Arthur Middleton Manigault, and a great-nephew of Arthur Middleton.

==Career==

In December 1837, he entered the United States Navy as a midshipman. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1851, serving &quot;with honor during the Mexican War.&quot; In 1853, he was Lieutenant on the USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; with Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s expedition to Japan. While in Japan, Morris received gifts from Emperor Kōmei. In 1860, he was First Lt. of the USS &quot;Marion&quot; with the Africa Squadron off the coast of Africa.

He resigned his commission on January 29, 1861, following South Carolina&#x27;s secession and was ordered to the command of the CSS &quot;Huntress&quot;, side-wheel steamer, in Savannah. In March, he was appointed a First Lieutenant in the Confederate States Navy. From 1861 to 1863, Morris served on the Savannah, Georgia Station where he married his second wife.

After John Newland Maffitt became ill at Brest, France, Morris took over in January 1864 as commander of the CSS &quot;Florida&quot;. As commander, he captured &quot;Electric Spark&quot;, &quot;Harriet Stevens&quot;, &quot;Golconda&quot;, &quot;Margaret Y. Davis&quot;, and USS &quot;Mondamin&quot; along the coast of the United States. Morris then crossed the ocean to Tenerife in the Canary Islands before cruising back to Brazil capturing the &quot;B.X. Hoxie&quot;, &quot;Cairaissanne&quot;, &quot;David Lapsey&quot;, USS &quot;Estella&quot;, &quot;George Latimer&quot;, &quot;Southern Rights&quot;, &quot;Greenland&quot;, &quot;Windward&quot;, &quot;William C. Clark&quot;, and &quot;Zelinda&quot;. In October 1864, however, his ship was illegally captured in a Brazilian harbor by the Union Navy. Morris and most of his crew were ashore when his ship was boarded in the middle of the night while at anchor in neutral waters. During the remainder of the American Civil War, he served abroad as an agent of the Confederate States government.

===Later life===
Following the war, Morris and his family settled in England. After the War, his wife took an interest in the education of President Jefferson Davis&#x27; daughter, Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Davis at the convent in France. In 1880, he returned to the United States and lived the rest of his life in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Personal life==
Morris was twice married. His first wife was Hannah Heyward Troup (1830–1854), a daughter of Camilla Heyward Brailsford and James McGilvary Troup. After her death in 1854, he married Clementina Hansen McAllister (1832–1907), a daughter of George Washington McAllister of Strathy Hall, Georgia (and namesake of Fort McAllister), in November 1861. His second wife was a first cousin of Archibald McAllister, a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania during the Civil War. Together, they were the parents of:

* Elizabeth Manigault Morris (1863–1910), who never married and died while abroad with her sister.
* Henry Manigault Morris (1865–1884), who was born in Caen, France and died unmarried.
* Lewis Morris (1867–1940), a doctor and Captain in the United States Navy who married Mary Gibbs Murphy, a daughter of Thomas and Mary (née Gibbs) Murphy of New York, in 1906. After his first wife&#x27;s death, he married Ella Willard (née Bingham) Duffy (–1953), a daughter of Jacob Willard Bingham, in 1911.
* Clementina Rosalie Morris (1873–1919), who was born in Brighton, England. She died unmarried in 1919 and left her dog, Tommy Moonface, a legacy of $10 month of the rest of his life for his &quot;board and keep&quot;.

Morris died at his home, 908 St. Paul Street in Baltimore, on March 22, 1895. His funeral service, led by the Rev. Dr. John Sebastian Bach Hodges, was held at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Baltimore. His pall-bearers were Gen. John Gill, Henry Thompson, Capt. Fitzhugh Carter, John Carey, Capt. Yates Stirling, John W. Williams, John I. Middleton and Gen. Joseph Lancaster Brent. After the funeral, his body was sent to New York where was laid to rest in the family vault at St. Ann&#x27;s Church in Morrisania. His widow died on August 24, 1907.

<text>Bala () is a town and community in Gwynedd, Wales. Formerly an urban district, Bala lies in the historic county of Merionethshire, at the north end of Bala Lake (). According to the 2021 census, Bala had a population of 1,999 and 72.5 per cent of the population could speak Welsh.

==Toponym==
The Welsh word &quot;bala&quot; refers to the outflow of a lake.

==History==

Tomen Y Bala ( high by diameter) is a tumulus or &quot;moat-hill&quot;, formerly thought to mark the site of a Roman camp.

In the 18th century, the town was well known for the manufacture of flannel, stockings, gloves and hosiery.

The large stone-built theological college, &quot;Coleg y Bala&quot;, of the Calvinistic Methodists and the grammar school (now Ysgol y Berwyn), which was founded in 1712, are the chief features, together with the statue of the Rev. Thomas Charles (1755–1814), the theological writer, to whom was largely due the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society. In 1800 a 15-year-old girl, Mary Jones, walked the from her home village Llanfihangel-y-Pennant to purchase a Welsh Bible in Bala. The scarcity of the Bible, along with the determination of Mary to get one (she had saved for six years), was a major factor in the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804.

Betsi Cadwaladr, who worked with Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, and who gave her name to the Health Board, came from Bala. Other famous people from the Bala area include Michael D. Jones, Christopher Timothy, Owen Morgan Edwards, born in Llanuwchllyn, and T.E. Ellis, born in Cefnddwysarn.

Bala hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1967, 1997 and 2009. The 2009 Eisteddfod was notable because the chair was not awarded to any of the entrants as the standard was deemed to be too low. Bala hosted the Eisteddfod Genedlaethol yr Urdd Gobaith Cymru, National Eisteddfod for the Welsh League of Youth, in 2014. On 16 June 2016, Bala&#x27;s name was changed to Bale temporarily in honour of Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale. This was only for the duration of UEFA Euro 2016.

==Twinning==
Bala, Ontario, Canada, was named after the town in 1868. They have become twin towns.

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the 2021 United Kingdom census, 72.5 per cent of all usual residents aged 3+ in Bala can speak Welsh.

The 2011 census noted 78.5 per cent of all usual residents aged 3 years and older in the town could speak Welsh. The Welsh-language skills of Bala residents were as follows in 2011 and 2021:
=== Identity ===
According to the 2011 census, 70.5 per cent of the population noted that they had Welsh-only national identity, with 22.2 per cent noting that they had no Welsh national identity at all. According to the 2021 census, 64.8 per cent of the population noted that they had Welsh-only national identity.

==Geography==
Set within the Bala Fault, Bala Lake () is the largest natural lake in Wales at in length and wide. At , its depths could hide the tower of St Giles Church in Wrexham and still have of water above. The lake has occasionally been known to freeze over, most recently in the severe winters of 1947 and 1963. The rare Gwyniad fish—trapped in the lake at the end of the last ice age, some 10,000 years ago—is in danger because its natural home is increasingly unsuitable. A member of the whitefish family, it is found only in the lake.

Cwm Hirnant, a valley running south from Bala, gives its name to the Hirnantian Age in the Ordovician Period of geological time.

The closest major urban areas to Bala are Wrexham at , Chester at , and Liverpool, to the northeast. Nearby villages include Llanfor, Llandderfel, Llanycil, Llangower, Llanuwchllyn, Rhyd-uchaf and Rhos-y-gwaliau.

===Climate===
As with the rest of the UK, Bala benefits from a maritime climate, with limited seasonal temperature ranges, and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year.

==Attractions==
The Afon Tryweryn, a river fed from Llyn Celyn which runs through Bala, is world-famous for its white water kayaking. International governing bodies, the International Canoe Federation, the European Canoe Union and the British Canoe Union all hold national and international events there. The Canolfan Tryweryn National Whitewater Centre has its home in Bala. There are at least three local campsites that cater for the influx of canoeists from many parts of the world.

An annual music festival known as &#x27;Wa Bala&#x27; is also held in the town. The venue hosts local Welsh bands and is similar in format to Dolgellau&#x27;s Sesiwn Fawr.

Nearby are the mountains Aran Fawddwy and Arenig Fawr.

Coleg y Bala is at the top of the hill on the road towards Llyn Celyn. The Victoria Hall is a small old cinema, that had been a community hall. There are several chapels: notably Capel Mawr and Capel Bach. The livestock market on Arenig Street is still going strong. Bro Eryl estate was built just after World War II. Mary Jones World, a heritage centre about Mary Jones and her Bible is located just outside the town in nearby Llanycil.

Bala Town Hall, which now operates as a restaurant, dates back to circa 1800.

== Transport ==

Bala has been served by various railway stations on the Great Western Railway:
*Bala Lake Halt railway station was Bala&#x27;s first station, on the Bala and Dolgelly Railway (open 1868 to 1882; 1934 to 1939)
**Bala (Penybont) railway station is the name of the Bala Lake heritage railway&#x27;s station on the site of the Bala Lake Halt
*Bala (New) railway station - Bala&#x27;s second station, on the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway (open 1882 to 1965)
*Bala Junction railway station - The meeting point of the Bala and Dolgellau Railway, Corwen and Bala Railway and the Bala and Festiniog Railway (open 1882 to 1965)

The Bala Lake Railway () runs for from Llanuwchllyn to the edge of the town, along a section of the former trackbed of the Great Western Railway&#x27;s line between Ruabon and Barmouth. It terminates at Bala (Penybont) railway station, which opened in 1976 on the site of the former Lake Halt station. As of 2020, work is being undertaken to extend the line along the lake foreshore to a new station in the town centre.

Bus services are provided by Lloyds Coaches, as part of the Welsh Government funded TrawsCymru network. Services operate westbound to Barmouth via Dolgellau, and eastbound to Wrexham via Corwen and Llangollen. Through ticketing is available for onward connections at Dolgellau, to Bangor, Machynlleth and Aberystwyth.

The town lies on the A494, a major trunk road that leads to Dolgellau, 18 miles to the southwest, and to Ruthin, Mold and Queensferry to the northwest. The A4212 starts in the town, and crosses the Migneint to Trawsfynydd. Heading southeast, the B4391 crosses the Berwyn range to the English border and the town of Oswestry.

<doc id="1219909" wikidata="Q1778567" url="?curid=1219909" title="Shōgun (1980 miniseries)">
<text>Shōgun is a 1980 American historical drama miniseries based on James Clavell&#x27;s 1975 novel of the same name. The series was produced by Paramount Television and first broadcast in the United States on NBC over five nights between September 15 and 19, 1980. It was written by Eric Bercovici and directed by Jerry London, and stars Richard Chamberlain, Toshiro Mifune, and Yoko Shimada, with a large supporting cast. Clavell served as executive producer. 

The miniseries is loosely based on the adventures of English navigator William Adams, who journeyed to Japan in 1600 and rose to high rank in the service of the shōgun. It follows fictional John Blackthorne&#x27;s (Chamberlain) experiences and political intrigues in feudal Japan in the early 17th century.

&quot;Shōgun&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and won several accolades, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series, the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama, and a 1981 Peabody Award. 

A new adaptation of Clavell’s novel was produced by FX and released on FX on Hulu in 2024.

==Plot==

After his Dutch trading ship &quot;Erasmus&quot; and its surviving crew is blown ashore by a violent storm at Anjiro on the east coast of Japan, Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, the ship&#x27;s English navigator, is taken prisoner by samurai warriors. When he is later temporarily released, he must relinquish his English identity, while adapting to the alien Japanese culture in order to survive. Being an Englishman, Blackthorne is at both religious and political odds with his enemy, the Portuguese traders, and the Catholic Church&#x27;s Jesuit order. The Catholic foothold in Japan puts Blackthorne, a Protestant and therefore a heretic, at a political disadvantage. This same situation, however, also brings him under the scrutiny of the influential Lord Toranaga, who mistrusts this foreign religion now spreading throughout Japan. He is competing with other samurai warlords of similar high-born rank, among them Catholic converts, for the very powerful position of shōgun, the military governor of Japan.

Through an interpreter, Blackthorne later reveals certain surprising details about the Portuguese traders and their Jesuit overlords. He explains to Lord Toranaga about the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas which was signed between Portugal and Spain in 1494, forcing Toranaga to trust him; they forge a tenuous alliance, much to the chagrin of the Jesuits. To help the Englishman learn their language and to assimilate to Japanese culture, Toranaga assigns a teacher and interpreter to him, the beautiful Lady Mariko, a Catholic convert and one of Toranaga&#x27;s most trusted retainers. Blackthorne soon becomes infatuated with her, but Mariko is already married, and their budding romance is ultimately doomed by future circumstances. Blackthorne also ends up saving the life of a Portuguese counterpart, Pilot Vasco Rodrigues, who becomes his friend despite their being on opposite sides.

Blackthorne saves Toranaga&#x27;s life by audaciously helping him escape from Osaka Castle and the clutches of his longtime enemy, Lord Ishido. To reward the Englishman, and to forever bind him to his service, Toranaga makes Blackthorne &quot;hatamoto&quot;, a personal retainer, and gifts him with a European flintlock pistol. Later, Blackthorne again saves Toranaga&#x27;s life during an earthquake by pulling him from a fissure that opened and swallowed the warlord, nearly killing him. Having proved his worth and loyalty to the warlord, during a night ceremony held before a host of his assembled vassals and samurai, Lord Toranaga makes Blackthorne a samurai; he awards him the two swords, 20 kimono, 200 of his own samurai, and an income-producing fief, the fishing village Anjiro, where Blackthorne was first blown ashore with his ship and crew. Blackthorne&#x27;s repaired ship &quot;Erasmus&quot;, under guard by Toranaga&#x27;s samurai and anchored near Kyoto, is lost to a fire, which quickly spread when the ships&#x27; night lamps are knocked over by a storm tidal surge. During a later attack on Osaka Castle by the secretive Amida Tong (ninja assassins), secretly paid for by Lord Ishido, Mariko is killed while saving Blackthorne&#x27;s life, who is temporarily blinded by the black powder explosion that kills her. Lord Yabu is forced to commit seppuku for his involvement with the ninja attack, into which he was coerced by Ishido. Right before he dies, Yabu gives Blackthorne his katana, and Yabu&#x27;s nephew, Omi, becomes the daimyō of Izu.

Blackthorne supervises the construction of a new ship, &quot;The Lady&quot;, using funds Mariko left to him in her will for this very purpose. Blackthorne is observed at a distance by Lord Toranaga; in a voice-over he reveals his inner thoughts, observing that Blackthorne still has much to teach him. It was Toranaga who ordered the &quot;Erasmus&quot; destroyed by fire to keep Blackthorne safe from his Portuguese enemies, who feared his hostile actions with the ship (and, if need be, the warlord will also destroy the new ship Blackthorne is currently building). He also discloses Mariko&#x27;s secret but vital role in the grand deception of his enemies, and, as a result, how she was destined to die, helping to assure his coming final victory. The warlord knows that Blackthorne&#x27;s karma brought him to Japan and that the Englishman, now his trusted retainer and samurai, is destined never to leave. Toranaga also knows it is his karma to become shōgun.

In a voice-over epilogue, it is revealed that Toranaga and his army are triumphant at the Battle of Sekigahara; he captures and then disgraces his old rival, Lord Ishido, burying him up to his neck to die slowly. The narrator concludes that when the Emperor of Japan offered Toranaga the position of shōgun, he &quot;reluctantly agreed&quot;.

==Cast==
Only three of the Japanese actors spoke English in the entire production: Shimada, Obayashi, and Okada. At the time of filming, Shimada knew very little English, and heavily relied on her dialogue coach to deliver her lines phonetically. The English words that she could not pronounce were substituted or overdubbed in post-production.

==Production==
Clavell and NBC wanted Sean Connery to play Blackthorne, but Connery reportedly laughed at the idea of working for months in Japan, as he had disliked filming &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; there. According to the documentary &quot;The Making of Shōgun&quot;, other actors considered for the role included Roger Moore and Albert Finney.

Clavell said he was originally opposed to Richard Chamberlain&#x27;s casting, wanting Albert Finney. However he was extremely happy with Chamberlain&#x27;s performance: &quot;He&#x27;s marvelous&quot;, said Clavell.

The 16th-century European sailing ship used in the series was &quot;Golden Hinde&quot;, a replica of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hind&quot;. It was built in the early 1970s to mark the 400th anniversary of Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation. After it underwent a restoration programme, the ship remains as an exhibit located at St Mary Overie Dock, Cathedral Street, London, SE1 9DE, United Kingdom.

Shots of Toranaga&#x27;s castle used Hikone Castle in Shiga Prefecture.

The Japanese characters speak in Japanese throughout, except when translating for Blackthorne; the original broadcast did not use subtitles for the Japanese dialog. As the movie was presented from Blackthorne&#x27;s point of view, the producers felt that &quot;what he doesn&#x27;t understand, we [shouldn&#x27;t] understand&quot;.

===Sexuality and violence===
&quot;Shōgun&quot; broke several broadcast taboos and contained several firsts for American television.
* It was the first network show allowed to use the word &quot;piss&quot; in dialogue and actually to show the act of urination. As a symbolic act of Blackthorne&#x27;s subservience to the Japanese ruling class and to punish him for saying &quot;I piss on you and your country&quot;, Blackthorne is urinated upon by Kasigi Omi, a local leading samurai.
* In the first episode, Blackthorne&#x27;s stranded shipmates are to be suspended in a cargo net into a boiling vat of soy sauce and water; one of them, Pieterzoon, is killed that way until Blackthorne acquiesces to the Japanese nobility.
* A man is shown beheaded early in the first chapter, another first for network TV (although the film version of the sequence was more bloody).
* Men are shown wearing fundoshi.
* Mariko is shown naked in a bath scene, and when Blackthorne is reunited with his men, a woman&#x27;s breast is visible.
* &quot;Shōgun&quot; was also noted for its frank discussion of sexuality (e.g., pederasty), and matters such as Japanese ritual suicide (seppuku).

== Release ==
=== Broadcast ===
&quot;Shōgun&quot; was broadcast in the United States on NBC over five nights between September 15 and 19, 1980. A version of the miniseries edited into one-hour episodes has been broadcast in North America.

===Theatrical release===
In Japan, &quot;Shōgun&quot; was cut to a 159-minute version and released theatrically on November 9, 1980. Stuart Galbraith IV described this version of the film as &quot;fatally cut to ribbons&quot;. It was later restored to its full length for a home video release in Japan.

A heavily truncated 125-minute edit of the miniseries was released in 1980 to European theatrical film markets. This was also the first version of &quot;Shōgun&quot; to be released to the North American home video market (a release of the full miniseries did not occur until later). The theatrical version contains additional violence and nudity that had been removed from the NBC broadcast version.

=== Home media ===
The five-disc DVD release has no episode breaks and bonus features on disc 5.
* DVD release: September 30, 2003
* Feature length: 547 minutes
* Extras: 13-segment documentary on the making of &quot;Shōgun&quot; (79:24); Historical Featurettes – The Samurai (5:34), Tea Ceremony (4:35), and Geisha (4:56); audio commentary by Director Jerry London on 7 selected scenes

The 125-minute version has yet to be released on DVD or Blu-ray.

CBS Home Entertainment&#x27;s Blu-ray release of &quot;Shōgun&quot; on three discs was on July 22, 2014, and featured a 1080p remastered video presentation, a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound mix, and a restored Dolby Digital mono track; the special features are exactly the same as on the original 2003 DVD release.

== Reception ==
=== Reception ===
&quot;Shōgun&quot; was produced after the success of the television miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; (1977) that had aired on the ABC Network in 1977. The success of &quot;Roots&quot;, as well as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), resulted in many other miniseries during the 1980s. &quot;Shōgun&quot;, which first aired in 1980, also became a highly rated program and continued the wave of miniseries over the next few years (such as &quot;North and South&quot; and &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;) as networks clamored to capitalize on the format&#x27;s success.

NBC had the highest weekly Nielsen ratings in its history with &quot;Shōgun&quot;. Its 26.3 average rating was the second highest in television history after ABC&#x27;s with &quot;Roots&quot;. An average of 32.9% of all television households watched at least part of the series. The miniseries&#x27; success was credited with causing the mass-market paperback edition of Clavell&#x27;s novel to become the best-selling paperback in the United States, with 2.1 million copies in print during 1980, and increased awareness of Japanese culture in America. In the documentary &quot;The Making of &#x27;Shōgun&quot;&#x27; it is stated that the rise of Japanese food establishments in the United States (particularly sushi houses) is attributed to &quot;Shōgun&quot;. It was also noted that during the week of broadcast, many restaurants and movie houses saw a decrease in business. The documentary states many stayed home to watch &quot;Shōgun&quot;—unprecedented for a television broadcast. (The home VCR was not yet ubiquitous and still expensive in 1980.)

====Reception in Japan====
The miniseries was reported to have been negatively received in Japan, where it was broadcast in 1981 on TV Asahi, as the series&#x27; fictionalization of events in the 16th century seemed frivolous and trivial. Many Japanese viewers were already accustomed to historical drama series such as NHK&#x27;s annual taiga dramas, which were considered more faithful towards the history they are depicting than the miniseries.

<doc id="1219913" wikidata="Q3163506" url="?curid=1219913" title="I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings">
<text>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 autobiography describing the young and early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.

Angelou was challenged by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, to write an autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize &quot;Caged Bird&quot; as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by black American women in the years following the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.

Angelou uses her autobiography to explore subjects such as identity, rape, racism, and literacy. She also writes in new ways about women&#x27;s lives in a male-dominated society. Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book&#x27;s central character, has been called &quot;a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America&quot;. Angelou&#x27;s description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of &quot;a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression&quot;. Angelou&#x27;s treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book. Literacy and the power of words help young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma.

&quot;Caged Bird&quot; was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; paperback bestseller list for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book&#x27;s graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.

==Background==
Before writing &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; at the age of forty, Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as composer, singer, actor, civil rights worker, journalist, and educator. In the late 1950s, she joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met a number of important African-American authors, including her friend and mentor James Baldwin. After hearing civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the Civil Rights Movement. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She worked for several years in Ghana, West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator. She was invited back to the US by Malcolm X to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965. In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but he too was assassinated on April 4, which was also her birthday. For many years, Angelou responded to King&#x27;s murder by not celebrating her birthday, instead choosing to meet with, call, or send flowers to his widow, Coretta Scott King.Angelou was deeply depressed in the months following King&#x27;s assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968. The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou&#x27;s stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day Judy Feiffer called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou&#x27;s editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and &quot;told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book&quot;. At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright, and was in the middle of writing a series for PBS television station WNET. According to Angelou, Baldwin had a &quot;covert hand&quot; in getting her to write the book, who advised Loomis to use &quot;a little reverse psychology&quot;; Angelou later reported that Loomis told her: &quot;It&#x27;s just as well, because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible&quot;. Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing &quot;Caged Bird.&quot; After &quot;closeting herself&quot; in London, it took her two years to write it. She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer Jessica Mitford, before submitting it for publication.

Angelou subsequently wrote six additional autobiographies, covering a variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes, and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, and back to the U.S., from the beginnings of World War II to King&#x27;s assassination. Like &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include &quot;Gather Together in My Name&quot; (1974), &quot;Singin&#x27; and Swingin&#x27; and Gettin&#x27; Merry Like Christmas&quot; (1976), &quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; (1981), &quot;All God&#x27;s Children Need Traveling Shoes&quot; (1986), &quot;A Song Flung Up to Heaven&quot; (2002), and &quot;Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom&quot; (2013, at the age of 85). Critics have often judged Angelou&#x27;s later autobiographies &quot;in light of the first&quot;, and &quot;Caged Bird&quot; generally receives the highest praise.

Beginning with &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, Angelou used the same &quot;writing ritual&quot; for many years. She would get up at 5 am and check into a hotel room, where the staff were instructed to remove pictures from the walls. She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that this ritual indicated &quot;a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time&quot;. Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to &quot;enchant&quot; herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to &quot;relive the agony, the anguish, the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;&quot;. She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, to &quot;tell the human truth&quot; about her life. Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, &quot;It may take an hour to get into it, but once I&#x27;m in it—ha! It&#x27;s so delicious!&quot; She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in &quot;telling the truth&quot;. Angelou told scholar Joanne M. Braxton that she tried to &quot;suspend herself from the present&quot; while writing her autobiographies and put herself into the time wrote about, despite understanding that &quot;I might be trapped in that time&quot;, a process she called &quot;frightening&quot;. According to Myra K. McMurray, when Angelou was often asked how she escaped from her painful past, she would respond, &quot;How the hell do you know I did escape?&quot; McMurray states that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; is not &quot;an exorcism of or escape from the past&quot;, but that it was &quot;a transmutation of that past&quot;, adding, &quot;The almost novelistic clarity of &quot;Caged Bird&quot; results from the artistic tension between Angelou&#x27;s recollected self and her authorial consciousness&quot;.

===Title===
When selecting a title, Angelou turned to Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet whose works she had admired for years. Jazz vocalist and civil rights activist Abbey Lincoln suggested the title. According to Lyman B. Hagen, the title pulls Angelou&#x27;s readers into the book while reminding them that it is possible to both lose control of one&#x27;s life and to have one&#x27;s freedom taken from them. Angelou has credited Dunbar, along with Shakespeare, with forming her &quot;writing ambition&quot;. According to Mary Jane Lupton, the caged bird in the title symbolizes a chained slave and appears frequently in Angelou&#x27;s writings. Lupton also discusses Angelou&#x27;s use of the word &quot;sings&quot;, which she says critics have tended to downplay. The word creates an upward mood and &quot;suggests the survival of African Americans through the spiritual&quot;. Although singing is more developed in Angelou&#x27;s later books, she hints at the &quot;possibilities of joyful song&quot; in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;. Finally, also according to Lupton, the cage is a symbol of the restraint of not only the Black body, but of the female Black body. The cage is also a metaphor for the roles that force the bird to deny its identity and reject interrelationships with others, not just for the child Maya, but for almost everyone in her community.

The title of the book comes from the third stanza of Dunbar&#x27;s poem &quot;Sympathy&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,
When he beats his bars and would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart&#x27;s deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings—
I know why the caged bird sings.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Plot summary==
&quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; follows Marguerite&#x27;s (called &quot;My&quot; or &quot;Maya&quot; by her brother) life from the age of three to seventeen and the struggles she faces—particularly with racism and self-affirmation—in the Southern United States. Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and disabled uncle (Uncle Willie) in Stamps, Arkansas. Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents&#x27; abandonment throughout the book—they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.
Many of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors and the subliminal awareness of race relations weaved in society. Although Momma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps&#x27; Black community, the white children of their town, in an &quot;almost ritual insult&quot;, hassle Maya&#x27;s family relentlessly. One of these &quot;powhitetrash&quot; girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident which leaves Maya, watching from a distance, indignant and furious. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders, where he moans and groans under the potatoes throughout the night. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth-grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya&#x27;s rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis&#x27;s championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.

A turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey&#x27;s father unexpectedly appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in St. Louis, Missouri. Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother&#x27;s boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and is murdered, presumably by Maya&#x27;s uncles. Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother. Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, &quot;the aristocrat of Black Stamps,&quot; who encourages her through books to regain her voice. This coaxes Maya out of her shell.

Later, Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in San Francisco, California, to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends George Washington High School and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the California Labor School. Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female cable car conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father&#x27;s girlfriend.

During Maya&#x27;s final year of high school, she worries that she might be a lesbian (which she confuses due to her sexual inexperience with the belief that lesbians are also hermaphrodites). She ultimately initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which, on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school. Maya gives birth to her son at the end of the book.

==Style and genre==
Angelou&#x27;s prose works, while presenting a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form, can be placed in the long tradition of African-American autobiography. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development, however, often lead reviewers to categorize her books, including &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, as autobiographical fiction. Other critics, like Mary Jane Lupton, insist that Angelou&#x27;s books should be categorized as autobiographies because they conform to the genre&#x27;s standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic Claudia Tate, Angelou calls her books autobiographies. Dolly McPherson states that Angelou&#x27;s work demonstrates how a writer can use the autobiography to define her quest for human individuality, identify her struggle with &quot;the general condition of Black Americans&quot;, and claim a representative role not only for Black Americans, but for &quot;the idea of America&quot;. McPherson goes on to say that &quot;through a study of her work, one gains a closer access to American cultural history&quot;.

As Lupton states, what makes Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies different than more conventional autobiographies is her &quot;denial of closure&quot;. Lupton says that no other serial autobiography places the mother/child theme in the center of the conflict, which made it important to the book&#x27;s narrative. Lupton calls the narrative style in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;rich, humorous, intense, engaging&quot;. The language Angelou uses can be frightening and her dialogue in the book, which is sharp and direct, conveys her characters&#x27; distinctive language and both reflects the language of her literary models and draws on the Southern speech patterns of her characters. Her use of metaphor places Angelou &quot;within the stylistic tradition of black protest literature&quot;. She also uses precision to describe objects or places and her observations are sensual. As Lupton puts it, &quot;Her writing resembles a series of photographs or fragments of music: snapshots taken from many angles, notes played from a variety of instruments&quot;. McPherson agrees, stating that in her autobiographies, Angelou &quot;uses the narrative gifts of an accomplished writer&quot;. Braxton compares Angelou&#x27;s style to that of Zora Neale Hurston and Era Bell Thompson, stating that Angelou also uses &quot;rhythmic language, lyrically suspended moments of consciousness, and detailed portraiture&quot;. Braxton, due to Angelou&#x27;s use of humor and folklore, also calls her a &quot;tale-teller &quot;par excellence&quot;.&quot; Harold Bloom, who does not think as highly of Angelou&#x27;s poetry and does not find her subsequent autobiographies as compelling as her first, compares the tone in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; with the tone Rudyard Kipling uses in &quot;Kim&quot;, stating that Angelou &quot;provides us with a voice that we encounter very infrequently, whether in life or in literature&quot;. According to Susan Gilbert, however, while Angelou records African American cadences and speech patterns, she does not limit herself &quot;to the tongues of black Arkansas or ghetto streets&quot;. For example, Angelou describes the codeswitching that many in her community engage in; as Gilbert also says, the language Angelou uses &quot;moves between a strong, colloquial simplicity and a sometimes over-blown literary mannerism&quot;.
At first, Angelou intended to return to poetry and play-writing after completing &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and write no more autobiographies, but as she stated in an interview in 1989, she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and so that she could &quot;change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century&quot;, adding that &quot;I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression&quot;. McPherson agrees, stating in 1990 that no other American writer had chosen to make their &quot;major literary and cultural contribution so predominately in autobiographical form&quot;. As Angelou told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, &quot;Autobiography is awfully seductive; it&#x27;s wonderful&quot;. She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of &quot;speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning &#x27;we&#x27;&quot;. As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person&#x27;s story, but the collective&#x27;s. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Angelou, throughout her series of autobiographies, also seeks to describe the personal, cultural, social, and historical influences that shaped her life and identity. Her experiences, as described in her books, &quot;represent stages of her spiritual growth and awareness&quot;. As McPherson puts it, Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies &quot;creates a unique place within Black autobiographical tradition&quot; and reveal &quot;important insights into Black traditions and culture&quot;. Unlike other Black autobiographers like Anne Moody in &quot;Coming of Age in Mississippi&quot;, however, Angelou is less concerned with her book&#x27;s place or setting, and instead focuses on her growing awareness of her environment.

Joanne Braxton sees &quot;Caged Bird&quot; as &quot;the fully developed black female autobiographical form that began to emerge in the 1940s and 1950s&quot;. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe states that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; was written during an important period for African American literature, when there was an influx of prose writings by African American women. The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition. Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother. As Gilbert puts it, &quot;the reader of the book must deal throughout the dual perspective of the child, growing to consciousness of herself and the limits of her world, and the author, experienced, confident, and didactic&quot;. Braxton states that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; has two points of view, the child and the mature narrator/artist; while the child&#x27;s point of view governs Angelou&#x27;s &quot;principle of selection&quot;, the tone of the adult narrator is personal and compelled to explore aspects of her coming of age. Keneth Kinnamon states that like other Black female writers and unlike many male writers, Angelou was concerned with themes such as community, sexism, sexual exploitation, and relationships with family friends.

George E. Kent states that due to &quot;its special stance toward the self, the community, and the universe&quot;, &quot;Caged Bird&quot; has a unique place within Black autobiography. McPherson says about Angelou: &quot;I know of no other autobiographer in American letters who celebrates and sings her life with as much verve and display of vulnerability&quot;, adding that Angelou has demonstrated how the genre of the autobiography &quot;can be transformed into a strong evocation of the human spirit&quot;. Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou one of the &quot;pioneers of self-exposure&quot;, willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, Angelou was worried about her readers&#x27; reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, &quot;Gather Together in My Name&quot;, that she was a prostitute. She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to be honest about it.

Angelou has recognized that there are fictional aspects to her books, and that she tends to &quot;diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth&quot;. Angelou discussed her writing process with Plimpton, and when asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she admitted that she had. She stated, &quot;Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about&quot;. Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, &quot;One can assume that &#x27;the essence of the data&#x27; is present in Angelou&#x27;s work&quot;, adding that Angelou &quot;fictionalizes, to enhance interest&quot;. For example, Angelou uses the first-person narrative voice customary with autobiographies, told from the perspective, as Lupton puts it, of a child that is &quot;artfully recreated by an adult narrator&quot;, although at times the book sounds more like fiction than autobiography. Harold Bloom says that, &quot;like all autobiographies, [&quot;Caged Bird&quot;] has fictive elements, but whatever they may be, they evidently work to the book&#x27;s engaging artfulness&quot;. Angelou identifies with slavery, verifying its power in her life and works, but Black womanhood and truth, themes found throughout the history of Black autobiography, is transformed by the period she describes. As Lupton puts it, &quot;In &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, for example, she records a life story begun in fear of crosses burning in the night, a life that is directly affected by the brutal remnants of slavery&quot;. Lupton states that Angelou presents material not found in other autobiographies, written by both Black and white writers, because she addresses topics from the perspective of an African American woman. Lupton also compares &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and the next four volumes to prison narratives, although through her use of the caged bird symbol, her prison is symbolic rather than literal.

&quot;Caged Bird&quot; has been called a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;; for example, Lupton compares it to other &quot;bildungsromans&quot; like George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;. According to Lupton, &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers; an examination of the role of literature in life; and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life. Angelou uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls &quot;the Maya character&quot;. Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is &quot;damned difficult&quot;, but &quot;very necessary&quot;. Scholar Liliane Arensberg, in her discussion about the theme of death in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, suggests that Angelou &quot;retaliates for the tongue-tied child&#x27;s helpless pain&quot; by using her adult self&#x27;s irony and wit. As Lupton says, Maya &quot;fills readers&#x27; imaginations as have very few similar characters in American autobiography&quot; as she evolves from child to woman.

==Form==
When Angelou wrote &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature, according to critic Pierre A. Walker, was thematic unity. One of Angelou&#x27;s goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion, in order to achieve her political purposes, which were to demonstrate how to resist racism in America. The structure of the text, which resembles a series of short stories, is not chronological but is arranged according to themes. Walker, in his 1993 article about &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, &quot;Racial Protest, Identity, Words, and Form&quot;, focuses on the book&#x27;s structure, and describes how it supports her presentation of racism. Walker states that critics had neglected analyzing its structure, choosing to focus instead on its themes, which he feels neglects the political nature of the book. He states, &quot;One serves Angelou and &quot;Caged Bird&quot; better by emphasizing how form and political content work together&quot;. Angelou structures her book so that it presents a series of lessons about how to resist racism and oppression. Maya&#x27;s growth in resisting racism unifies the book thematically, something that &quot;stands in contrast to the otherwise episodic quality of the narrative&quot;. The way in which Angelou constructs, arranges, and organizes her vignettes often undermine the chronology of her childhood by &quot;juxtaposing the events of one chapter with the events of preceding and following ones so that they too comment on each other&quot;. As Dolly McPherson points out, Angelou does not record every experience, but instead selects, through a series of episodic chapters, &quot;valuable, life-determining truths about the world, about her community, and about herself&quot;. Lupton points out that &quot;Caged Bird&#x27;s&quot; form develops from the characters&#x27; interaction with each other, not through the development of dramatic actions. According to scholar Sondra O&#x27;Neale, unlike Angelou&#x27;s poetry and despite the nonchronological structure of the book, which O&#x27;Neale calls &quot;skillfully controlled&quot;, Angelou&#x27;s prose &quot;follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms&quot;. 

The incident with the &quot;powhitetrash&quot; girls in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; takes place in chapter 5, when Maya was ten years old, well before Angelou&#x27;s recounting of her rape in chapter 12, which occurred when Maya was 8. Walker explains that Angelou&#x27;s purpose in placing the vignettes in this way is that it followed her thematic structure. Angelou&#x27;s editor, Robert Loomis, agrees, stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. Hagen sees Angelou&#x27;s structure somewhat differently, focusing on Maya&#x27;s journey &quot;to establish a worthwhile self-concept&quot;, and states that she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically. Hagen notes that she does not begin &quot;Caged Bird&quot; chronologically, with Maya and Bailey&#x27;s arrival in Stamps. Rather, she begins it later much later, with an embarrassing experience during an Easter service at church, an incident that demonstrates Maya&#x27;s diminished sense of self, insecurity, and lack of status. George E. Kent divides &quot;Caged Bird&quot; into two &quot;areas of black life&quot;: the religious-folk tradition, as represented through Maya&#x27;s grandmother, and the blues-street tradition, as represented through her mother. Kent states that the first impact of the blues-street tradition on Maya and her brother is instability, when their mother ships the children to Stamps. Kent goes on to say that Angelou balances the qualities of both traditions, adding that &quot;a good deal of the book&#x27;s universality derives from black life&#x27;s traditions seeming to mirror, with extraordinary intensity, the root uncertainty in the universe&quot;. 

Sidonie Ann Smith states that Angelou starts the book with the Easter service incident because it &quot;defines the strategy of the narrative&quot;. Smith also states that Angelou follows the convention in Black American autobiography, especially slave narratives, which recreates the environment of enslavement and oppression at the beginning, before describing how the protagonist escapes from it. Hagen explains that Angelou&#x27;s purpose is to demonstrate Maya&#x27;s journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother at the end of the book. Even though the book begins with the Easter service, Angelou begins her &quot;autobiographical journey&quot; in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; with Maya and Bailey&#x27;s train ride from California to Arkansas and continues in a triangular movement between Stamps, St. Louis, and California; according to Lupton, the reader, by following Maya&#x27;s journeys, &quot;can get a solid sense of how structure operates within an autobiographical text&quot;. McPherson states that Angelou opens &quot;Caged Bird&quot; with the Easter poem, which she evaluates in light of the book&#x27;s plot and themes, because it emphasizes its significance in her life, describes her rootlessness, and &quot;is also a blues metaphor that foreshadows a cyclical pattern of renewal, rebirth, change in consciousness, and the circuitous journey of recovered innocence&quot;. 

==Themes==
===Identity===
In the course of &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, Maya, who has been described as &quot;a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America&quot;, goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity. Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the &quot;formation of female cultural identity&quot; is woven into the book&#x27;s narrative, setting Maya up as &quot;a role model for Black women&quot;. Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou&#x27;s &quot;identity theme&quot; and a major motif in Angelou&#x27;s narrative. McPherson states that the heart of &quot;Caged Bird,&quot; which she calls Angelou&#x27;s &quot;singular traditional focus&quot; is &quot;the growth of the individual from innocence to knowledge&quot;. Sidonie Ann Smith, using the opening incident at church, connects Maya&#x27;s appearance with the imprisonment and displacement imposed on her by the white society around her. Smith goes on to say that the pain of Maya&#x27;s displacement is intensified by her awareness of the displacement, a personal displacement that is amplified by &quot;the ambience of displacement within the larger black community&quot;. Maya&#x27;s displacement and &quot;diminished self of self&quot; is reflected in her community&#x27;s diminished self image. Smith also connects Maya&#x27;s rape with her displacement, stating that Mr. Freeman took advantage of Maya&#x27;s feelings of abandonment, self-loathing, and rejection. Maya is freed from her further displacement by Mrs. Flowers, who accepted Maya for who she was and &quot;allows her to experience the incipient power of her own self-worth&quot;. Braxton states that Angelou&#x27;s &quot;celebration of self&quot; is nurtured and developed by Black women—Momma, Mrs. Flowers, and even Maya&#x27;s mother, Vivian. Both Momma and Vivian are different representations of &quot;the Jungian archetype of the Great Mother, protecting, nurturing, sheltering&quot;. 

After Momma sends the children to their mother in California to protect them from the racism in Stamps, Maya learns from Vivian increased self-reliance; Braxton adds that Maya &quot;grows out of the passive stage, asserting herself through action, and forging an identity&quot;. Maya&#x27;s earlier rebellion against Mrs. Cullinan, her racist white employer, is another way she preserves her individual and affirms her self-worth. Smith connects this incident with Maya&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s decision to send Maya and Bailey to their mother in San Francisco, where Maya finally feels at home; as Smith puts it, &quot;She could feel in place in an environment where everyone and everything seemed out-of-place&quot;. This was solidified in her experiences in Mexico and San Diego with her father, her short period of homelessness, and her pregnancy and birth of her son. The book ends in this way: &quot;The black American girl child has succeeded in freeing herself from the natural and social bars imprisoning her in the cage of her own diminished self-image by assuming control of her life and fully accepting her black womanhood&quot;. Angelou told a interviewer that she did not set out, while writing &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, thinking out her own life or identity, but that she was &quot;thinking about a particular time in which I lived and the influence of that time on a number of people...I used the central figure—myself—as a focus to show how one person can make it through those times&quot;. Maya&#x27;s unsettled life in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; suggests her sense of self &quot;as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications&quot;. Angelou begins to describe her changing identity in the book&#x27;s early pages describing the Easter church service, when Maya painfully realizes that her fantasy of becoming white will never happen. As Dolly McPherson states, the scene graphically re-creates &quot;the dynamics of many young black girls&#x27; disillusionment and imprisonment in American society&quot;, which gives the message to Maya and girls like her that physical beauty is defined in terms of whiteness. Arensberg states that Maya&#x27;s displacement, or rootlessness, as well as her geographic movements and temporary residences throughout the book, are formative aspects of Maya&#x27;s identity. It also helps her develop &quot;a stoic flexibility&quot; that becomes a way for her to both protect herself against and deal with the world around her. According to Arensberg, the flexibility is &quot;both a blessing and a curse: it enables her to adapt to various and changing environments, but it also keeps her forever threatened with loss or breakdown of her identity&quot;.

Maya fantasizes that she is white because she feels unloved, especially by her parents; both she and her brother deal with their abandonment and rejection by pretending that their mother was dead. McPherson also states that Angelou&#x27;s statement in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, &quot;If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat. It is an unnecessary insult&quot; characterize important parts of Angelou&#x27;s life and &quot;provide wide-ranging, significant themes&quot; of the book. Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, stating that the statement contains the &quot;pervading themes&quot; in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;. McPherson states that unlike Christ, whose death and resurrection was being celebrated, it was impossible for Maya to be &quot;born into another life where she will be white and perfect and wonderful&quot;, although Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth in the book and &quot;skillfully re-creates the psychic, intellectual, and emotional patterns that identify her individual consciousness and experience&quot;. Maya&#x27;s childhood is shaped by her religiously devout grandmother, who although was not emotionally demonstrative, Maya knew that she was loved by her, which strengthened Maya as she grew and developed into childhood and early adolescence. As Angelou wrote in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, &quot;a deep-brooding love hung over everything [Momma] touched&quot;. Liliane Arensberg finds it significant that the first vignette Angelou presents in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; is her embarrassing incident at the Easter Sunday church service; even though the incident is out of order chronologically, Angelou considers it &quot;an epiphanic moment of her youth&quot; because it presents Maya&#x27;s identity as a young child, her blackness and her outcast status. Angelou compares the repurposed dress Maya wore to the crepe paper at the back of a hearse, which represented Maya&#x27;s body and the death of her fantasy about whiteness. As Arensberg states, Maya is forced to acknowledge her blackness and the &quot;malevolent force beyond her control that dictates her personal and racial identity&quot;.

As Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women&#x27;s lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Up until this time, Black women were not depicted realistically in African American fiction and autobiography, meaning that Angelou was one of the first Black autobiographers to present, as Cudjoe put it, &quot;a powerful and authentic signification of womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair&quot;. Lauret sees a connection between Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies, which Lauret calls &quot;fictions of subjectivity&quot; and &quot;feminist first-person narratives&quot;, and fictional first-person narratives (such as &quot;The Women&#x27;s Room&quot; by Marilyn French and &quot;The Golden Notebook&quot; by Doris Lessing) written during the same period. As French and Lessing do in their novels, Angelou employs the narrator as protagonist and depends upon &quot;the illusion of presence in their mode of signification&quot;. Maya is &quot;the forgotten child&quot;, and must come to terms with &quot;the unimaginable reality&quot; of being unloved and unwanted; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced; for example, her belief in her own ugliness was &quot;absolute&quot;. 

Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, Angelou demonstrates the &quot;racist habit&quot; of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her &quot;Mary&quot;. Angelou describes the employer&#x27;s renaming as the &quot;hellish horror of being &#x27;called out of [one&#x27;s] name&#x27;&quot;. Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya&#x27;s race and self-image. Cudjoe, who calls the incident &quot;poignant&quot;, states the renaming denies Maya of her individuality, although Maya&#x27;s response shocks Mrs. Cullinan into &quot;(re)cognition of her personhood&quot;. King, in her discussion of the discourse production of poetic names in African American literature and its gendered difference, states that Angelou uses what King calls &quot;name fragmentation&quot; in this vignette. It also demonstrates &quot;the subversive complexities and resistive nature of black names&#x27; deep talk when confronted with racist oppression&quot;, which is the point of the vignette. Angelou uses the conflicts of renaming to demonstrate that resistance to the practice and to communicate a confrontation of linguistic control, or as King puts it, &quot;a battle for dominion and control over the naming process&quot;. The renaming emphasizes Maya&#x27;s feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. As King puts it, the renaming &quot;stresses the violent effects of being renamed through the contaminating sieve of racism&quot;.

Another incident in the book that solidifies Maya&#x27;s identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally &quot;in control of her fate&quot;. This experience is central to Maya&#x27;s growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father&#x27;s girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth. Her experience of homelessness also teaches her that &quot;outside the barriers of race, all men and women are the same&quot; and confirms her commitment to her personal growth. McPherson connects Maya&#x27;s experiences while visiting her father with her determination and accomplishment of becoming the first streetcar conductor in San Francisco several months later.

Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African American mothers as &quot;breeder[s] and matriarch[s]&quot;, and have presented them as having &quot;a creative and personally fulfilling role&quot;. Lupton believes that Angelou&#x27;s plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif as is found in the work of Harlem Renaissance poet Jessie Fauset. For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother is dead. Maya&#x27;s feelings for and relationship with her mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and &quot;repressed violent aggression&quot;. For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent to them by their mother. Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey. McPherson believes that family, or as she calls it, &quot;kinship concerns&quot;, is an important theme in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, which due to the siblings&#x27; early displacement, begins with a preoccupation with the nuclear family, but evolves into a dependence upon the extended family. Maya&#x27;s conflict about her mother is not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed. The two main maternal influences on Maya&#x27;s life change as well; Vivian becomes a more active participant, while Momma becomes less effective as Maya. As she becomes a mother herself, Maya moves from childhood to adulthood. Braxton adds that Maya does more than move from semi-orphanhood to motherhood; she also grows through various stages of self-awareness. McPherson states that as the book ends, Maya is no longer a displaced child; as a new mother, she takes control of her life and fully accepts her womanhood. As Susan Gilbert puts it, unlike at the beginning of the book, &quot;the writer neither wishes to be white nor fears for her black son&quot;. Braxton adds that Maya&#x27;s entry into motherhood is an assertion of her identity as both a mother and a daughter, &quot;as well as her relation to the maternal archetype&quot;. The birth of Maya&#x27;s son opened up new avenues of identity, not only for herself, but for her grandmother and mother as well.

===Racism===
Joanne M. Braxton calls &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the Civil Rights era&quot;. Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment, and places it in the African American literature tradition of political protest. Stamps, Arkansas, as depicted in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, has very little &quot;social ambiguity&quot;; it is a racist world divided between Black and white, male and female. Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps, her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters, &quot;the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans&quot;, and her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society. Hilton Als characterizes the division as &quot;good and evil&quot;, and notes how Angelou&#x27;s witness of the evil in her society, which was directed at Black women, shaped Angelou&#x27;s young life and informed her views into adulthood. Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage, described in Paul Laurence Dunbar&#x27;s poem, as a prominent symbol throughout her series of autobiographies. Like elements within a prison narrative, the caged bird represents Angelou&#x27;s confinement resulting from racism and oppression, forces that were outside Maya&#x27;s control or comprehension. The caged bird metaphor also invokes the &quot;supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle&quot;. Scholar Ernece B. Kelley calls &quot;Caged Bird&quot; a &quot;gentle indictment of white American womanhood&quot;; Hagen expands it further, stating that the book is &quot;a dismaying story of white dominance&quot;. In the Stamps of &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, although &quot;segregation was so complete that most Black children didn&#x27;t really, absolutely know what Whites looked like&quot; and Blacks rarely interacted with them, the white world was a constant threat and Blacks were expected to behave in a certain way in order to survive. As Keneth Kinnamon states, Angelou does not de-emphasize the effects of racism on her community, but &quot;shows with respect if not always agreement the defensive and compensatory patterns needed to survive in such an environment&quot;. Lupton, who sees the themes of racism and slavery as separate from imprisonment in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, states that Maya constantly feels caged, &quot;unable to escape the reality of her blackness&quot;. Imprisonment is also expressed in the book&#x27;s title.

Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies, beginning with &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression. The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from &quot;helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest&quot;. Walker insists that Angelou&#x27;s treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. In Angelou&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;powhitetrash&quot; incident, Maya reacts with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness. Angelou portrays Momma as a realist whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the survival and success of those who came after her. As Braxton put it, the white and female children &quot;deliberately exploit their protected status to intimidate and humiliate&quot; Maya&#x27;s family. Braxton also considers the incident an implied threat towards the men in the family. Momma teaches Maya how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism, and that it is an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism. Walker calls Momma&#x27;s way a &quot;strategy of subtle resistance&quot;; Dolly McPherson calls it &quot;the dignified course of silent endurance&quot; and &quot;a pivotal experience in her initiation&quot; of Maya&#x27;s awareness about her place in the racist world. McPherson, who considers the incident &quot;a dramatic re-enactment of the kind of spiritual death and regeneration Angelou experienced during the shaping of her development&quot;, also states that the incident taught Maya how her grandmother was able to survive and triumph psychologically in a hostile environment. Not only was it a depiction of the tensions between Blacks and whites during the period, it also depicted how Momma was able to protest, transcend the children&#x27;s behavior towards her, and preserve her own dignity. Braxton states that the incident demonstrates Momma&#x27;s courage, a virtue Angelou learns to use and develop from her; Angelou praises Momma&#x27;s courage in the book and praises it in later writings. Courage in the face of racism is also shown in Angelou&#x27;s treatment of lynching. Early in the book, Momma helps a man trying to escape lynching by hiding him and giving him supplies for his journey, thus endangering her own security. Later, the family has to conceal Uncle Willy from a potential lynch mob in their store&#x27;s potato and onion bin. Braxton states that it demonstrates the absurdity of lynching and that in this incident, Momma &quot;fulfills the archetypical role of the outraged mother by concealing her innocent child&quot;.

Angelou later said that her years living in Africa and her relationship to South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make in the early 1960s taught her &quot;to see the survival of distinctly African ways&quot; among African Americans, which affect her portrayal of character, both collectively and individually. For example, as Susan Gilbert puts it, Angelou &quot;relates the habits of address...to a heritage of tribal belonging&quot;. Angelou&#x27;s description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps also demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions. Angelou demonstrates how religion, which &quot;was designed to keep the Afro-American in an oppressed condition&quot;, has been subverted and used by her community to help them withstand the cruelty of racism. McPherson states that Angelou&#x27;s depiction of the economic displacement of Black cotton field workers, who gather at Momma&#x27;s store before and after work and could never get ahead despite their hard work, demonstrates how the Black community nurtures its members and helps them survive in an antagonistic environment. Angelou&#x27;s depiction of the Joe Lewis fight demonstrates how her community has subverted the American institution of sports. As Selwyn R. Cudjoe puts it, the fight was supposed to &quot;act as a pacifier, as entertainment for Blacks, and to help demonstrate how far they had progressed in the society&quot;. Instead, it became a recreation of the struggle between white and Black America. Later in the book, Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan and breaks the race barrier when she becomes the first Black streetcar operator in San Francisco. McPherson states that Maya&#x27;s experience with Mrs. Cullinan places her &quot;into a clearer awareness of social reality and into a growing consciousness of self-worth&quot;. Mrs. Cullinan&#x27;s attempt to change Maya&#x27;s name to fit her own convenience also &quot;echoes the larger tradition of American racism that attempts to prescribe the nature and limitations of a Black person&#x27;s identity&quot;. Maya stands up for her individuality and value by deliberately breaking Mrs. Cullinan&#x27;s heirloom china.

Angelou describes other incidences that demonstrate the strength and unity in Stamps. As McPherson puts it, &quot;Unlike the white American, in order for the individual black American to be self-reliant, he or she must rely on the community&quot;. Lupton states that Angelou&#x27;s emphasis on collectivity, &quot;a major aspect of black survival&quot;, is relevant in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;. McPherson agrees, although how Maya uses and defines community changes when she leaves Stamps, and continues to adapt later in her life, as she describes in the later volumes of her autobiographical story. Kinnamon, in his comparison of &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;Black Boy&quot;, states that unlike Wright, whose response to the poverty and racism of his childhood is &quot;individualistic alienation from all sense of community&quot;, Angelou&#x27;s response is to embrace community. Kinnamon calls &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;a celebration of black culture&quot;. Also unlike Wright, Angelou recalls the larger rituals of black community, such as religious practices, the radio broadcast of the Joe Lewis fight, a summer fish fry, the telling of ghost stories, and graduation activities, favorably. McPherson states that Angelou uses community to demonstrate how Blacks survived racism; as McPherson puts it, &quot;personal values become synonymous with Stamps&#x27; communal values&quot;. Liliane Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her &quot;racial hatred&quot;, common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers. McPherson states that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; describes centuries-long traditions, developed in Africa and during slavery, that taught Black children to never resist &quot;the idea that whites were better, cleaner, or more intelligent than blacks&quot;. At first, Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity. Both Angelou&#x27;s depiction of her community&#x27;s reaction to the victorious Joe Louis fight and her elementary school graduation, in which they respond to a racist school official demeaning their future opportunities by singing &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;, demonstrate the strength and resiliency of her community.
===Rape===
Angelou&#x27;s description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the autobiography, although it is presented briefly in the text. Opal Moore calls Angelou&#x27;s graphic and complicated depiction of rape and incest &quot;the center and bottom&quot; of the autobiography and states the rape must be understood within the context of the entire book; everything that happens to Maya in it &quot;should be understood against the ravaging of rape&quot;. For Moore, the rape &quot;raises issues of trust, truth, and lie, love, and the naturalness of a child&#x27;s craving for human contact, language and understanding, and the confusion engendered by the power disparities that necessarily exist between children and adults&quot;. Angelou describes two sexual encounters with Mr. Freeman; she uses metaphors, which allow her to describe her pain without having to explain what and how she feels.

Scholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou&#x27;s treatment of rape in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; to Harriet Jacobs&#x27; in her 1861 autobiography, &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot;. According to Vermillion, one major difference between Angelou and Jacobs is the way somatophobia, which Vermillion defines as the &quot;fear and disdain for the body&quot;, especially the female body, is depicted in their books. Angelou, for example, is freer to portray her rape, her body, and her sexuality than Jacobs because she does not have to deal with the 19th century patriarchal view of &quot;true womanhood&quot;. Jacobs describes herself as beautiful and sexually desirable, but Angelou, as a child and young adult, thinks she is ugly. Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans; Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture, while Angelou uses it to first internalize, then challenge, 20th-century racist conceptions of the Black female body. Angelou connects her rape with the suffering of the poor and the subjection of her race and &quot;represents the black girl&#x27;s difficulties in controlling, understanding, and respecting both her body and her words&quot;. Vermillion also connects the violation of Maya&#x27;s body to her self-imposed muteness because she believes that her lie during the trial is responsible for her rapist&#x27;s death. McPherson evaluates the rape in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; in light of how it affected Maya&#x27;s identity, and how her displacement from the dangerous but comfortable setting of Stamps to her mother&#x27;s chaotic and unfamiliar world of St. Louis contributes to Maya&#x27;s trauma and withdrawal into herself. Sondra O&#x27;Neale states, however, that the birth of Maya&#x27;s son at the end of the book provides the reader with hope for her future and implies that the rape would not control her life.

Arensberg, who blames Maya&#x27;s vulnerability on her previous experiences of neglect, abandonment, and lack of parental love, notes that Maya&#x27;s rape is connected to the theme of death in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya&#x27;s brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman&#x27;s trial, stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya&#x27;s uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, &quot;I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk&quot;. Christine Froula connects Maya&#x27;s self-imposed muteness with Ovid&#x27;s retelling of the Philomela rape myth, in which the victim&#x27;s power of speech becomes a threat to the rapist and another victim of the rapist.

Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou&#x27;s depiction of the rape &quot;a burden&quot; of &quot;Caged Bird&quot;: a demonstration of &quot;the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and ... the &#x27;unnecessary insult&#x27; of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence&quot;. Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When Joanne Braxton asked Angelou decades later how she was able to survive the trauma she experienced, Angelou explained it by stating, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember a time when I wasn&#x27;t loved by somebody&quot;. She also told Braxton that she thought about the rape daily and that she wrote about the experience because it was the truth and because she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape for both the victim and the rapist. She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else and so that the rape victim might gain understanding, forgive herself, and not blame herself.

===Literacy===
As Lupton points out, all of Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies, especially &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and its immediate sequel &quot;Gather Together in My Name&quot;, are &quot;very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it&quot;. Lupton compares Angelou&#x27;s informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the &quot;direct instruction of African American cultural forms&quot;. Angelou&#x27;s quest for learning and literacy parallels &quot;the central myth of black culture in America&quot;: that freedom and literacy are connected. As Fred Lee Hord puts it, &quot;the book world was a world of integration, where you were the confidant of all the denizens—in whose skins, regardless of color, you could move inside and breathe free&quot;. Hord adds that Maya also rejected the part of her culture &quot;that she associated with powerlessness in the world of book learning&quot;. For example, one of the most traumatic experiences Angelou relates in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; is her eighth-grade graduation, when the white commencement speaker denigrates Blacks, reduces their potential to athletics, and conveys to his audience a sense of impotence and nothingness. The anger and depression Maya feels changes when Henry Reed leads the audience and graduates in the Negro National Anthem, when Maya senses the pride and strength of her community. As Hord puts it, Maya realizes, for the first time, &quot;how black writers not only made possible an alternative world, but pushed the boundaries outward in her actual world&quot;. Hord also states that the white speaker helped Maya demystify her ideas about the power of education for African Americans; the composer of the Anthem also provided her with the strength to resist the white speaker&#x27;s dehumanization of her community.

Angelou states, early in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, &quot;During these years in Stamps, I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare. He was my first white love. Although I enjoyed and respected Kipling, Poe, Butler, Thackeray and Henley, I saved my young and loyal passion for Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and W. E. B. DuBois&#x27; &#x27;Litany at Atlanta.&#x27; But it was Shakespeare who said, &#x27;When in disgrace with fortune and men&#x27;s eyes.&#x27; It was a state with which I felt most familiar&quot;. As Hord states, Shakespeare identified with the state Maya, &quot;a young castaway without parents in a freedom-stifling, small southern town&quot;, found herself in. Christine Froula, though, in her discussion about incest in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and Alice Walker&#x27;s &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, points out that Maya and Bailey gave up memorizing a scene from Shakespeare to avoid their grandmother&#x27;s opposition to reading a white author, choosing Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; instead. Froula goes on to state that the vignette &quot;raises the question of what it means for a female reader and fledging writer to carry on a love affair with Shakespeare or with male authors in general&quot; and connects Maya&#x27;s attraction to Shakespeare and his writings with Maya&#x27;s rape described later on. Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya&#x27;s rape and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;, which Vermillion calls &quot;Angelou&#x27;s most complex and subtle examination of Maya&#x27;s attachment to white literary discourse&quot; and which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. Vermillion maintains that Maya&#x27;s attachment to &quot;Lucrece&quot; indicates her attachment to the verbal and the literary, which leads her to ignore her corporeality and helps her find comfort in the poem&#x27;s identification with suffering. As Vermillion states, Maya must use the words she memorizes and recites to reconstruct her own body. Froula says that although Maya&#x27;s memorization of &quot;Lucrece&quot; helps her overcome her literal muteness, it ushers her into a literary recovery because it connects her voice to Shakespeare&#x27;s words. Froula goes on to say, &quot;But if Shakespeare&#x27;s poem redeems Maya of her hysterical silence, it is also a lover she embraces at her peril&quot; because it &quot;signals a double seduction&quot; of white and male culture. Braxton, however, explains Maya&#x27;s connection with Shakespeare and with Dunbar, who influenced Angelou more than the other writers she names in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, by stating that they &quot;speak directly to her dilemma—the problem of developing a positive self-image in a culture whose standards of beauty are uniformly white, and the problem of finding a place for herself in that culture&quot;. Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape, writing in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, &quot;...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the door and save me&quot;.

According to Walker, the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;. For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again. Myra K. McMurray agrees, saying that Angelou uses art, even the artistic aspects of the Joe Lewis fight and of other instances, to demonstrate her community&#x27;s survival instincts. The importance of both the spoken and written word appears repeatedly in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and in all of Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies. Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised Oprah Winfrey in a 1993 interview to &quot;do as West Africans do ... listen to the deep talk&quot;, or the &quot;utterances existing beneath the obvious&quot;. As Liliane Arensberg puts it, &quot;If there is one stable element in Angelou&#x27;s youth it is [a] dependence upon books&quot; and fiction, including &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;The Shadow&quot;, and Marvel Comics, and works by Shakespeare, Poe, Dunbar, Jane Austen, William Makepeace Thackeray, Samuel Johnson, Langston Hughes, and W. E. B. Du Bois. The public library is a &quot;quiet refuge&quot; to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis. Novels and the characters in them became Maya&#x27;s references for viewing and dealing with the world around her. Hagen describes Angelou as a &quot;natural story-teller&quot;, which &quot;reflect[s] a good listener with a rich oral heritage&quot;. Hagen also insists that Angelou&#x27;s years of muteness provided her with this skill. Books and poetry, with Mrs. Flowers&#x27; help, become Maya&#x27;s &quot;first life line&quot; and a way to cope with the trauma of her rape. First, Mrs. Flowers treats her as an individual, unconnected to another person, and then by encouraging Maya to memorize and recite poetry, gives her a &quot;sense of power within herself, a transcendence over her immediate environment&quot;. Mrs. Flowers&#x27; friendship awakens Maya&#x27;s conscience, increases her perspective of what is around her and of the relationship between Black culture and the larger society, and teaches her about &quot;the beauty and power of language&quot;. Their friendship also inspires Maya to begin writing poetry and record her observations of the world around her.

Angelou was also influenced by slave narratives, spirituals, and other autobiographies. Angelou read through the Bible twice as a young child, and memorized many passages from it. African American spirituality, as represented by Angelou&#x27;s grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou&#x27;s writings, in the activities of the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermons and public addresses, and in scripture. Angelou told an interviewer in 1981 that the Bible and the language spoken at church was crucial to her development as a writer, likening it to going to the opera. Hagen says that in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to &quot;Mother Wit&quot;, which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African American community as expressed in folklore and humor. Arensberg states that Angelou uses the literary technique of wit, humor, and irony to defeat her enemies by mocking them and using her adult narrative voice. In tis way, Angelou &quot;retaliates for the tongue-tied child&#x27;s helpful pain&quot;. Arensberg goes on to state that Angelou even ridicules the child version of herself, although unlike other autobiographers, she avoids linking the child she was to the adult she became. As Vermillion states, Angelou reembodies Maya following the trauma of her rape by critiquing her early dependency on white literary discourse, even though Angelou &quot;is not content to let the mute, sexually abused, wishing-to-be-white Maya represent the black female body in her text&quot;.

Angelou&#x27;s humor in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and in all her autobiographies is drawn from Black folklore and is used to demonstrate that in spite of severe racism and oppression, Black people thrive and are, as Hagen states, &quot;a community of song and laughter and courage&quot;. According to Selwyn R. Cudjoe, although life is difficult for the individuals in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, moments of happiness are not absent in the book. He compares &quot;Caged Bird&quot; to Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, but states that &quot;such moments came...as &#x27;the occasional episodes(s) in a general drama of pain&#x27;&quot;. Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and &quot;balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions&quot;. Hagen also characterizes &quot;Caged Bird&quot; as a &quot;blues genre autobiography&quot; because it uses elements of blues music. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one&#x27;s life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;. Angelou&#x27;s use of African-American oral traditions create a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it. The vignettes in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; feature literary aspects such as oral story traditions and traditional religious beliefs and practices that depict African American cultural life. For example, the story about Maya&#x27;s racist employer Mrs. Cullinan parallels traditional African American folklore, the significance, horror, and danger accompanied by the importance of naming in traditional society, and the practice of depriving slaves of their true names and cultural past.

==Reception and legacy==

===Critical reception and sales===

&quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies. The other volumes in her series of seven autobiographies are judged and compared to &quot;Caged Bird.&quot; It became a bestseller immediately after it was published. Angelou&#x27;s friend and mentor, James Baldwin, maintained that her book &quot;liberates the reader into life&quot; and called it &quot;a Biblical study of life in the midst of death&quot;. According to Angelou&#x27;s biographers, &quot;Readers, especially women, and in particular Black women, took the book to heart&quot;. By the mid-1980s, &quot;Caged Bird&quot; had gone through 20 hardback printings and 32 paperback printings. The week after Angelou recited her poem &quot;On the Pulse of Morning&quot; at President Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1993 inauguration, sales of the paperback version of &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, which had sold steadily since its publication, and her other works rose by 300–600 percent. The 16-page publication of &quot;On the Pulse of Morning&quot; became a bestseller, and the recording of the poem was awarded a Grammy Award. The Bantam Books edition of &quot;Caged Bird&quot; was a bestseller for 36 weeks; 400,000 copies of her books were reprinted to meet demand. Random House, which published Angelou&#x27;s hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase.

By the end of 1969, critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other Black autobiographers. Poet James Bertolino asserts that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;is one of the essential books produced by our culture&quot;. He insists that &quot;[w]e should all read it, especially our children&quot;. It was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970, has never been out of print, and has been published in many languages. It has been a Book of the Month Club selection and an Ebony Book Club selection. In 2011, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; placed the book in its list of 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923. &quot;Caged Bird&quot; catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim and was a significant development in Black women&#x27;s literature because it &quot;heralded the success of other now prominent writers&quot;.

The book&#x27;s reception has not been universally positive; author Francine Prose, who calls &quot;Caged Bird&quot; a &quot;survival memoir,&quot; or &quot;a first-person narrative of victimization and recovery&quot;, considers its inclusion, along with books like Harper Lee&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American society. Prose calls the book &quot;manipulative melodrama&quot;, and considers Angelou&#x27;s writing style an inferior example of poetic prose in memoir. She faults Angelou with poor writing, including combing a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and &quot;obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously&quot;.

Susan Gilbert calls &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;a story of hurt, and loneliness, and anger, and love&quot; and Robert A. Gross calls the book &quot;a &quot;tour de force&quot; of language&quot;. Other reviewers have praised Angelou&#x27;s use of language in the book, including E. M. Guiney, who reports that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; was &quot;one of the best autobiographies of its kind that I have read&quot;. Edmund Fuller insists that Angelou&#x27;s intellectual range and artistry were apparent in how she told her story and Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls it &quot;a triumph of truth in simple, forthright terms&quot;. R. A. Gross praises Angelou for her use of rich and dazzling images and Dolly McPherson praises Angelou for describing &quot;a life lived with intensity, honesty, and a remarkable combination of innocence and knowledge&quot;. McPherson, who calls Angelou &quot;an accomplished writer&quot;, calls the book &quot;a carefully conceived record of a young girl&#x27;s slow and clumsy growth&quot; and &quot;a record of her initiation into her world and her discovery of her interior identity&quot;. She goes on to praise Angelou for confronting her own painful past while recognizing that the painful events in her life &quot;form a necessary part of her development&quot;. McPherson also states that Angelou uses her narrative gifts and use of language to confidently and effectively describe her painful memories, while understanding that &quot;events are not only significant in themselves, but because they mark points of transcendence&quot;. Harold Bloom calls &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;more a carol than it is a prayer or plea&quot; and Sidonie Ann Smith states that Angelou&#x27;s &quot;genius as a writer is her ability to recapture the texture of the way of life in the texture of its idioms, its idiosyncratic vocabulary and especially in its process of image-making&quot;. 

Opal Moore, in her criticism of the push to ban &quot;Caged Bird&quot; from schools, states that the book&#x27;s message of overcoming racism transcends its author and that the book &quot;is an affirmation; it promises that life, if we have the courage to live it, will be worth the struggle&quot;. Liliane Arensberg states that like all autobiographies, &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;seems a conscious defense against the pain felt at evoking unpleasant memories&quot;. Mary Jane Lupton compares Angelou&#x27;s works with Richard Wright&#x27;s two-volume serial autobiographies, stating that Angelou&#x27;s transitions between her volumes are smoother than Wright&#x27;s and that her presentation of herself as a character is more consistent. Lupton also compares Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies with &quot;Dust Tracks on a Road&quot; (1942) by Zora Neale Hurston, &quot;Coming of Age in Mississippi&quot; (1968) by Anne Moody, &quot;Report From Part One&quot; (1972) by Gwendolyn Brooks, Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood (1996) by bell hooks, and Lilian Hellman&#x27;s series of four autobiographies. McPherson says that Angelou&#x27;s serial autobiographies, along with other contemporary autobiographies written by Baldwin, Moody, and Malcolm X, &quot;is the urge to articulate, as if for the first time, a sensibility at once determined and precluded by history&quot;.

===Influence===
When &quot;Caged Bird&quot; was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters. Julian Mayfield, who calls &quot;Caged Bird&quot; &quot;a work of art that eludes description&quot;, has insisted that Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies set a precedent for African American autobiography as a whole. Hilton Als insists that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as he put it, &quot;write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense&quot;. After writing &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for Blacks and women. &quot;Caged Bird&quot; made her &quot;without a doubt ... America&#x27;s most visible black woman autobiographer&quot;. Although Als considers &quot;Caged Bird&quot; an important contribution to the increase of Black feminist writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to &quot;its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist&quot; of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights Movement. Angelou&#x27;s writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to &quot;open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world&quot;.

Opal Moore has called for better preparation for teachers who use &quot;Caged Bird&quot; in their classrooms, stating that the book is a difficult text for both teachers and students. Angelou&#x27;s autobiographies, especially &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has used &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and &quot;Gather Together in My Name&quot; when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms. Angelou&#x27;s use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers to wonder what she &quot;left out&quot; and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with &quot;surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography&quot;.

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book &quot;Stories of Resilience in Childhood&quot;, analyzed the events in &quot;Caged Bird&quot; to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou&#x27;s book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used &quot;Caged Bird&quot; to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called &quot;Caged Bird&quot; a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.

===Censorship===
&quot;Caged Bird&quot; has been criticized by many parents, causing it to be removed from school curricula and library shelves. The book was approved to be taught in public schools and was placed in public school libraries through the U.S. in the early-1980s, and was included in Advanced Placement and gifted student curriculum. Attempts by parents to censor it began in 1983. Some have been critical of its sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent religious depictions. Many parents throughout the U.S. have sought to ban the book from schools and libraries for being inappropriate for younger high school students, for promoting premarital sex, homosexuality, cohabitation, and pornography, and for not supporting traditional values. Parents have also objected to the book&#x27;s use of profanity and to its graphic and violent depiction of rape and racism. Educators have responded to these challenges by removing it from reading lists and libraries, by providing students with alternatives, and by requiring parental permission from students. In 2009, Angelou expressed her sorrow and outrage about the banning of all her books, stating that those who insisted upon banning them had not read them. She also said, “I feel sorry for the young person who never gets to read [&quot;Caged Bird&quot;]&quot;.

In 2021, the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center, which stated that banning books like &quot;Caged Bird&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple&quot; by Alice Walker &quot;points to a larger pattern of banning books significant to African American history and culture&quot;. They found that &quot;Caged Bird&quot; was banned in prisons throughout the U.S.; for example, the book was banned in North Carolina prisons because officials determined that its depiction of sexual assault was a security threat.

In 2023, the book was banned, in Clay County District Schools, Florida.

&quot;Caged Bird&quot; appeared third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000, sixth on the ALA&#x27;s 2000–2009 list, and fell to 88th place on the ALA&#x27;s 2010-2019 list. As of 1998, it was one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms.

===Film version===

A made-for-TV movie version of &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; was filmed in Mississippi and aired on April 28, 1979, on CBS. Angelou and Leonora Thuna wrote the teleplay; the movie was directed by Fielder Cook. Constance Good played young Maya. Also appearing were actors Esther Rolle, Roger E. Mosley, Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee, and Madge Sinclair. Two scenes in the movie differed from events described in the book. Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the Joe Louis fight; in it, he expresses his feelings of redemption and hope after Louis defeats a white opponent. Angelou and Thuna also present Maya&#x27;s eighth grade graduation differently in the film. In the book, Henry Reed delivers the valedictory speech and leads the Black audience in the Negro national anthem. In the movie, Maya conducts these activities.

<doc id="1219916" wikidata="Q372172" url="?curid=1219916" title="Marxist–Leninist Party of the Netherlands">
<text>The Marxist–Leninist Party of the Netherlands ( or MLPN) was a fake pro-China communist party in the Netherlands set up by the Dutch secret service BVD to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes. The MLPN existed from 1968 to the early 1990s and was led throughout its existence by Pieter Boevé, who used the pseudonym Chris Petersen.

Boevé joined the Dutch secret service in 1955 after attending 5th World Festival of Youth and Students in Warsaw. Prior to the MLPN&#x27;s creation, he served as the international secretary of the Marxist-Leninist Centre of the Netherlands (MLCN), using his position to create contacts in China and Albania. He also started his own publication, &quot;De Kommunist&quot;, in 1966, against the wishes of his MLCN comrades. He was subsequently expelled from the party and formed his own League of Marxist-Leninists in the Netherlands (&quot;Liga van Marxisten-Leninisten in Nederland&quot;) in 1968. A year later, this party changed its name to the MLPN.

The MLPN claimed to represent the principles of Maoism against the &quot;heresies&quot; of the official pro-USSR Communist Party of the Netherlands. It never had more than a dozen real members, none of whom were aware of its actual purpose. Notwithstanding this, Boevé was able to cultivate many contacts within the Chinese government. He frequently received gifts and travelling expenses from the Chinese government and on one occasion was the guest of honour at a banquet presided over by Zhou Enlai.

The BVD dissolved the MLPN shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when they judged that it was no longer necessary. Boevé and another former BVD member went public with the true story of the party in 2004.

Boevé has claimed that he helped to facilitate the historic meeting of Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong in 1972. Prior to Nixon&#x27;s decision to go to China, Boevé was asked by his Chinese contacts as to his views on the possibility of better relations with the United States of America. He took this as a sign that the Chinese government was interested in improving relations between the two countries and passed his information on to the CIA.

The MLPN published a monthly periodical called &quot;De Kommunist&quot; (The Communist). It was entirely written by BVD operatives.

<text>Pollok Country Park is a country park located between Shawlands, Crossmyloof, and Pollok in Glasgow, Scotland. In 2007, Pollok Country Park was named Britain&#x27;s Best Park, and in 2008 it was named the Best Park in Europe, beating competition from parks in Italy, France, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Despite this, by 2019 it was considered that the park was &#x27;underused&#x27; with plans drawn up to encourage more visitors. 
==History and features==
The park, through which the White Cart Water flows towards Paisley, is the largest within the city of Glasgow. It was originally part of the Old Pollok Estate, which was home to the Maxwell family for over 700 years. In 1966 Mrs Anne Maxwell Macdonald gifted the estate, including Pollok House, to Glasgow Corporation with the condition that it remained a public park.

In 1878 the Poloc Cricket Club was established. Their &quot;Shawholm&quot; ground is one of several sporting facilities which ring the core of the park, including public playing fields at &quot;Nether Pollok&quot; near Shawlands (once containing the home ground of Pollok F.C. until 1926) and &quot;Norwood&quot; near Pollokshields, the private fields of Police Scotland and Hutchesons&#x27; Grammar School (previously, Craigholme School), the rugby ground of Cartha Queens Park RFC, Dumbreck Riding School and two golf clubs: &quot;Haggs Castle&quot; (founded 1910) located next to the M77 motorway and &quot;Pollok&quot; (1892) to the north of Barrhead Road, a dual carriageway which is the only direct route between the east and west sides of the park approximately in length. On the other side of the road is a further golf club, &quot;Cowglen&quot; (1906).

In 1954 the park also became home to Pollokshaws Bowling Club, the land donated by Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell of Pollok House; the club moved across Pollokshaws Road to celebrate its centenary. It is located near to Pollokshaws West railway station on the Glasgow South Western Line which is the nearest to the centre of the park and near-adjacent to its main entrance; railway station on a different route (the Cathcart Circle) is approximately a 0.5 km walk from the main entrance.

The park also contains the Burrell Collection, a purpose-built building designed to hold the large, eclectic antique and art collection of shipping magnate William Burrell, who donated the collection to the City of Glasgow on his death. Another feature of interest is the award-winning fold of Highland cattle, which is the most accessible of this species for the majority of Scots. In 2004, three mountain biking routes were opened by Olympic cyclist Chris Hoy. Strathclyde Police&#x27;s mounted and dog-handling divisions are based in the park. There are two allotment gardens, one near Haggs Castle Golf Club and one at Pollokshaws.

==Protests==
In the early 1990s the park was the site of a road protest camp, the &quot;Pollok Free State&quot;, which attempted to prevent the M77 motorway from cutting through the south-west side of the park and separating it from the nearby housing schemes. The road cost £53 million and destroyed 5,000 trees in a stretch of the park. Protesters, including local schoolchildren, attempted to prevent this using tactics such as building and occupying treehouses and tunnels. There was also a &quot;Carhenge&quot; of burnt-out and half-buried cars, from as far afield as Brighton, placed in the path of the road. Eviction of the camp by Wimpey bailiffs and police began on 23 March 1995, arresting 15 and injuring one. Though the camp failed to prevent the road being built, it was a formative experience for many Glasgow activists who had no previous experience of direct action. It also led to the resignation of M.P. Allan Stewart. As campaigners feared, the motorway has disconnected the park from communities to its north and west (Pollok, Corkerhill and Mosspark) with almost no direct access – there is one walkway on the north bank of the White Cart from near Corkerhill); by contrast, the eastern side of the park has three vehicular routes and two more access points for pedestrians and cyclists.

In early 2008 a campaign to &quot;Save Pollok Park&quot; was formed, protesting against outdoor adventure company Go Ape; the company was invited by Glasgow City Council to enhance outdoor recreational activities within the park. Over five thousand residents objected to the proposals to site a high wire forest adventure in the ancient North Wood.

<doc id="1219935" wikidata="Q2272625" url="?curid=1219935" title="The Cornfield">
<text>The Cornfield is an oil painting by the English artist John Constable, completed from January to March 1826 in the artist’s studio. The painting shows a lane leading from East Bergholt toward Dedham, Essex, and depicts a young shepherd boy drinking from a pool in the heat of summer. The location is along Fen Lane, which the artist knew well. Constable referred to the piece as The Drinking Boy.

On the advice of Constable&#x27;s friend, the botanist Henry Phillips, &quot;The Cornfield&quot; was painted with the trees and plants depicted as accurately as possible. Constable commissioned the engraver David Lucas to produce the plates of the painting for a book, &quot;Various Subjects of Landscape, Characteristic of English Scenery&quot;, first published in July 1830. The art historian Anthony Bailey considers &quot;The Cornfield&quot; to have &quot;opened the gate through which a great number of people were to pass into Constable&#x27;s country&quot;. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in April 1826, under the title &quot;Landscape: Noon&quot;, and shown in Paris from early November to the spring of 1828. The painting was praised but Constable did not find a buyer. After the artist’s death, funds were raised to purchase the work for the National Gallery.

==Background==
John Constable was born in 1776 in the Suffolk village of East Bergholt, to Golding Constable and his wife Ann. His father was a corn merchant, who owned Flatford Mill in the village and a mill in Dedham, Essex; Constable was expected to succeed his father in the business. After his education at schools in Lavenham and Dedham, Constable worked in his father&#x27;s corn business, but his younger brother Abram eventually took over the running of the mills.

In 1799, the 19-year-old Constable persuaded his father to let him pursue a career in art, and Golding granted him a small allowance to allow him to train. He entered the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer. Following his marriage to Maria Bicknell In 1816, Constable lived in Bloomsbury in central London, before his family settled in Hampstead, where they lived permanently from 1827 onwards. The year &quot;The Cornfield&quot; was painted, Constable was 50 and had not yet been accepted as a full member of the Royal Academy of Arts, despite having sought election since the early 1820s.

==Composition==

Constable&#x27;s painting &quot;The Cornfield&quot;, painted in oil on canvas, depicts a young shepherd. The boy, wearing a red waistcoat, is drinking from a pool as he rests from his work at noon in the heat of summer. He has removed his hat. The painting is a view of Fen Lane, which Constable knew well. As a schoolboy he had regularly walked along the lane, which was the shortest way from East Bergholt and over New Fen Bridge across to the River Stour toward his school in Dedham.

The painting was completed from January to March 1826 in Constable&#x27;s London studio. Constable himself called it &quot;The Drinking Boy&quot;, and he intended it to be his most important exhibited work of that year. The work is similar in size to &quot;The Lock&quot;, a painting that was originally planned as a pendant to &quot;The Cornfield&quot;.

Constable produced a smaller preparatory oil sketch, which has survived, and which shows how the work was developed over time. In the background of the sketch, the figure of the boy and his animals are not depicted. None of the trees in the sketch are dead, unlike the trees painted in the final work. He produced , now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. No sketches made at the scene are known.

Constable made &quot;The Cornfield&quot; as botanically accurate as possible. On 1 March 1826, his friend Henry Phillips, a botanist, wrote to Constable with advice about how the plants should be painted. Phillips commented: &quot;I think it is July in your green lane. At this season all the tall grasses are in flower, bogrush, bullrush, teasel. The white bindwind now hangs in flowers over the branches of the hedge; the wild carrot and hemlock flower in banks of hedges, cow parsley, water plantain, etc... bramble is now in flower, poppy, mallow, thistle, hop, etc..&quot; The trees were also carefully depicted. He was preoccupied by his work on the painting, writing to his friend John Fisher, &quot;I could think of and speak to no-one. I was like a friend of mine in the battle of Waterloo—he said he dared not turn his head to the right or left—but always kept it straight forward—thinking of himself alone.&quot;

The village of Higham, shown in the distance, is not actually visible from the lane; Constable&#x27;s son Charles Golding Constable stated after his father&#x27;s death that the view of Higham church did not exist. The crop in the field is probably meant to be wheat, depicted at full height and as tall as the gate at the end of the lane. To the public seeing Constable&#x27;s painting during his lifetime, the wheat would have been a representation of peace, fertility and wealth. Constable appears to have borrowed objects from his other paintings and drawings to include in &quot;The Cornfield&quot;; a tree in the painting bears a strong resemblance to another specimen in his &quot;&quot; (), and the boy—with his blue neck scarf, black hat and red waistcoat—is also depicted in Constable&#x27;s &quot;&quot; ().

According to the art historian Michael Rosenthal, &quot;The Cornfield&quot; typifies Constable&#x27;s picturesque phase, which culminated in 1828. After 1822 Constable&#x27;s was mainly done in his London studio, which led to him being more concerned with the effect of his painting on the senses, and less about realism. The work reflected Constable&#x27;s nostalgia for the rural Suffolk he recalled from his youth, considered by him to be lost.

===Engraving by Lucas===

Constable commissioned the engraver David Lucas to produce the plates of the painting for a book, &quot;Various Subjects of Landscape, Characteristic of English Scenery&quot;. The book was published in July 1830. After seeing prints of &quot;The Cornfield&quot; and &quot;The Lock&quot; produced by Lucas, Constable told him, &quot;Now... is every bit of sunshine clouded over in me. I can never look at these two flattering testimonies of the result of my singularly marked life... without the most painful emotions.&quot;

in 1834, when suffering from depression and seemingly jealous of the success the prints of &quot;The Lock&quot; and &quot;The Cornfield&quot; were attracting, Constable argued with Lucas, and complained his works were no longer giving him pleasure. He told his friend Leslie, &quot;The two beautiful prints by Lucas are in the [shop] windows, but every gleam of sunshine is blighted to me in the art at least. Can it... therefore be wondered at that I paint continual storms?&quot; He later apologised to Lucas.

After Constable&#x27;s death, James Brook Pulham, a former pupil, borrowed Lucas&#x27;s prints of &quot;The Cornfield&quot; and &quot;The Lock&quot; without permission from the home of the artist. This caused considerable distress to the family. The prints became well-known during the Victorian era, being images that the public had access to, in contrast with the original oil paintings at the National Gallery.

==Exhibitions and reception==
On 8 April 1826, Constable wrote to his friend Fisher that &quot;The Cornfield&quot; had been sent to the Royal Academy to be exhibited. When on display at the Royal Academy that year, the painting was shown under the title &quot;Landscape: Noon&quot;. When being shown, the painting was altered by another artist, the sculptor Francis Chantry, who joked, &quot;Why Constable, all your sheep have got the rot—give me the palette—I must cure them.&quot; Chantry tried unsuccessfully to amend the appearance of the sheep in the foreground. In September 1827, it went to the Paris Salon, where it was shown to the public from early November to the spring of 1828 under the title &quot;&quot;. It was returned to England the following September. In Paris, it failed to receive the same acclaim given to his previous works. It was praised by the critics but never managed to find a seller at any of the five exhibitions where it was shown. Constable had hoped for a sale, telling Fisher, &quot;I do hope to sell this present picture—as it has certainly got a little more eye-salve than I usually condescend to give to them.&quot;

When the work was exhibited in London at the British Institution in 1827, Constable included a quotation from a poem by the Scottish poet James Thomson:

&quot;The Times&quot; described the painting as &quot;singularly beautiful, and not inferior to some of Hobbema&#x27;s most admired works&quot;.

&quot;The Cornfield&quot; was shown by Constable at the Birmingham Society of Arts exhibition in 1829, and by the Worcester Institution in 1835.

The English author William Thackeray, writing in 1850, described the painting as &quot;under the influence of a late shower; the shrubs, trees and distance are saturated with it... One cannot but admire the manner in which the specific character of every object is made out: the undulations of the ripe-corn, the chequered light on the road, the freshness of the banks, the trees and their leafage, the brilliant clouds artfully contrasted against the trees, and here and there broken by azure.&quot; The miniaturist Andrew Robertson described the work as having &quot;all the truth of conception, with les of the manner that was objected to&quot; in works such as Constable&#x27;s &quot;Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows&quot;. The art historian Anthony Bailey considers the work to have &quot;opened the gate through which a great number of people were to pass into Constable&#x27;s country&quot;.

==Acquisition by the National Gallery==

In 1837, Constable&#x27;s friend Charles Robert Leslie began working on the purchase of one of Constable&#x27;s works for the nation, to be bought by a body of subscribers, The Committee of Friends and Admirers, chaired by the portraitist William Beechey. The committee had initially considered purchasing Constable&#x27;s &quot;Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows&quot;, but this work was rejected after it was thought to be &quot;too boldly executed&quot;. &quot;The Cornfield&quot; was valued at 300 guineas, . The funds were raised, and the National Gallery accepted the painting in December 1837.

&quot;The Cornfield&quot; was the first work to be sold following Constable&#x27;s death in 1837, and for 10 years, until the National Gallery acquired &quot;&quot; from Robert Vernon, it was the only painting by Constable in a national collection. , the work is not on public display in the galleries.

<doc id="1219941" wikidata="Q2387165" url="?curid=1219941" title="Hopper car">
<text>A hopper car () or [[Open wagon#Hopper wagons|hopper wagon]] () is a type of railroad freight car that has opening doors or gates on the underside or on the sides to discharge its cargo. They are used to transport loose solid bulk commodities such as coal, ore, grain, and track ballast. Plastic pellets and some finely ground material, similar to flour, are transported in hopper cars that have pneumatic unloading. The bottom gates on the pneumatic hoppers connect to a hose attached to industrial facilities&#x27; storage tanks. Air is injected to fluidize the railcar contents for unloading. The hopper car was developed in parallel with the development of automated handling of such commodities, including automated loading and unloading facilities.

Hopper cars are distinguished from gondola cars, which do not have opening doors on their underside or sides. Gondola cars are simpler and more compact because sloping ends are not required, but a rotary car dumper is required to unload them. Some &quot;dual-purpose&quot; hoppers have a rotary coupler on one or both ends, so they can be used in both rotary and bottom-dump operations.

== Types ==
Two main types of hopper car exist. Covered hopper cars, which are equipped with a fixed roof, are used for cargo like grain, sugar, and fertilizer, and Portland cement that must be protected from exposure to the weather. Open hopper cars, which do not have a roof, are used for commodities such as coal, which can suffer exposure with less detrimental effect.

Removable canvas covers are sometimes used to protect moisture sensitive commodities in open hopper cars. Closed hopper cars have a metal top with waterproof loading hatches, which provides superior protection. These loading hatches along the top of the covered hopper may be a single long opening along the centerline or a pattern of multiple round or square openings positioned to allow uniform weight distribution when loading the car.

Some covered hoppers have two to four separate bays, with chutes at the bottom to direct unloading contents. 

== Use ==
Hopper cars have been used by railways worldwide whenever automated cargo handling has been desired. &quot;Ore jennies&quot; is predominantly a term for shorter open hopper cars hauling taconite by the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway on Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range. The Coke Express, a CSX unit train of hopper cars loaded with coke, with the words &quot;Coke Express&quot; painted on the sides of the hoppers.

Large unit trains of various grain crops are a common sight in North America, reaching up to 125 cars long. These predominantly haul grain from the large farming areas of the Great Plains to various markets, but a number of unit trains originate from other major farming areas, such as Illinois and Indiana as well as the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These trains may originate from a single grain elevator, or may be marshaled in a yard from various locals (short trains which serve nearby industries). The destinations tend to be large flour mills or ports (for export), or they may be split up and delivered to multiple locations. The empty cars may return as a whole train, or may be sent back in smaller quantities on manifest trains (trains which carry just about any type of freight). These trains are used primarily for hauling products such as corn, wheat and barley.

== History ==

The word &quot;hopper&quot;, meaning a &quot;container with a narrow opening at bottom&quot;, goes back to the thirteenth century, and is found in Chaucer&#x27;s story &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot; (written late fourteenth century) in reference to a machine for grinding grain into flour.

Historically, open hopper cars were used to carry coarse mined products like coal, ore, and gravel, while boxcars were used for granular materials requiring protection from the elements.

Weatherproof covers were added to hopper cars, creating the covered hopper. Early production emphasized two-bay cars very similar to open coal hoppers and suitable for materials of similar density, like Portland cement or rock-salt. Some cars were available in the 1910s, and became more common by the 1940s. These early cars were volume-limited for less dense commodities like grain or sugar, so later designs include longer covered hopper cars with higher sides and three or more bottom bays. Increasing axle load limits have allowed some of the heavier loads formerly assigned to two-bay hoppers to be assigned to larger, more efficient three-bay hoppers.

Some covered hopper cars retain the conventional centersill as a strength member transmitting compression and tension forces from one car to the next. Beginning in the 1960s, designs distributing these forces along the sides of the car eliminated the centersill beam to simplify bulk material handling with wider hopper openings reducing the tendency for bridging to restrict gravity flow when unloading the car.

== Typical North American freight car weights and wheel loads ==
Increase in wheel loads has important implications for the rail infrastructure needed to accommodate future grain hopper car shipments. The weight of the car is transmitted to the rails and the underlying track structure through these wheel loads. As wheel loads increase, track maintenance expenses increase and the ability of a given rail weight, ballast depth, and tie configuration to handle prolonged rail traffic decreases. Moreover, the ability of a given bridge to handle prolonged rail traffic also decreases as wheel loads increase. The axle load is twice the wheel load.

Sarah Maria Taylor was born on January 7, 1974, in New York City, to James Taylor and Carly Simon. She attended Tabor Academy and began writing songs as a teenager. When asked about her mother&#x27;s role in learning how to write songs, she said, &quot;I asked my mom &#x27;can you show me how to write a song?&#x27; and she said &#x27;Sal, if you&#x27;re meant to write songs you&#x27;ll just know how to do it&#x27;.&quot;

She played with various bands in high school, and was a co-founder of the student rock band The Slip.

While attending Brown University, Taylor taught herself to play the guitar and performed as a solo artist.

At 20 years old, she survived a plane crash in Peru, motivating her to organize and record all of her songs, which led to the recording of her first album, &quot;Tomboy Bride&quot;.

==Career==
Taylor is a singer-songwriter, guitarist, artist, writer, educator, and philanthropist. As a musical artist, she has been in several music groups as well as having a solo career. She toured extensively in her solo career and had several songs featured in film and television. She has performed on talk shows such as the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

She is a former educator at the Berklee School of Music, and created the award-winning social-emotional learning (SEL) curriculum, Consenses Classroom. Taylor is an educator and advocate for youth with dyslexia. She was awarded the Hamilton School Life Achievement Award by the Wheeler School, along with her husband Dean Bragonier, for overcoming the challenges of learning differences. Taylor has spoken publicly on the topic at TEDx Nashville and the Dyslexic Advantage Leadership Conference.

Taylor is the founder of Consenses, a global, multidisciplinary, artistic collaboration where artists of different disciplines use one another&#x27;s work as a catalyst for their own original pieces, resulting in an artistic chain reaction. She co-founded the Tranquility Project, a non-profit organization, that raised money to remove land mines in Southeast Asia and provide assistance to land mine victims.

Taylor, who is vegan, converted a Volkswagen van, called &quot;Sally in the Raw&quot;, into a food cart featuring vegan and raw foods.

===Music===
Taylor is a singer, songwriter, musician (guitar), and recording artist. In addition to her solo career, she is a former member of The Slip and The Boogies. She turned down offers from major labels and in 1998, formed the indie record label Blue Elbow, through which she released three studio albums, &quot;Tomboy Bride&quot; (1999), &quot;Apt. #6S&quot; (2000), and &quot;Shotgun&quot; (2001).

She toured extensively throughout the US (1999–2002) with her five-piece Colorado-based band, playing 200 shows a year. The band was composed of Chris Soucy (guitars/vocals); Kenny Castro (bass); and Brian McRae, Kyle Comerford, and Dean Oldencott (drummers). Taylor wrote &quot;Tails From the Road 1998-2002&quot; documenting her tour, including performing shows with her brother Ben and crew.

Taylor retired from touring at age 30, moved to Boston, and began teaching music at the Berklee College of Music.

===&quot;Consenses&quot;===
In 2012, Taylor founded Consenses, a global, multidisciplinary, artistic collaboration where artists of different disciplines use one another&#x27;s work as a catalyst for their own original pieces, resulting in an artistic chain reaction. Hundreds of artists have participated, including Jimmy Buffett, Natasha Bedingfield, her mother, Carly Simon, her father, James Taylor, BalletBoyz, and Michael Nunn. Taylor was featured in the 2014 documentary &quot;Consenses - The Story&quot; by Erica Hill. Taylor also created the award-winning social-emotional learning (SEL) curriculum Consenses Classroom, in collaboration with Harvard Graduate School of Education graduate students.

===The Tranquility Project===
While traveling in Cambodia in 2002, Taylor and her husband Dean Bragonier visited the Angkor National Museum. where they met a nine-year-old girl who had lost a limb. She told them that she would never be able to marry because of her maiming. They were so moved by the experience that they formed the Tranquility Project, a non-profit organization that raised money to remove land mines in Southeast Asia and provide assistance to land mine victims. She appeared on the CD &quot;Too Many Years&quot; to benefit Clear Path International&#x27;s work with land mine survivors.

In 2007, Taylor hosted a charity concert in her home of Boulder, Colorado, with singer-songwriter Wendy Woo and the band Something Underground, made up of brothers Seth and Josh Larson. Taylor has joined the band in the last few years, traveling through the Midwest and Southeast Asia twice, performing charity concerts.

==Personal life==
Taylor is married to Dean Bragonier. On October 4, 2007, she gave birth to a son, Bodhi Taylor Bragonier. 

Both she and her husband have been diagnosed with dyslexia. Her son also has dyslexia, and has been the inspiration behind funding other families with similar NoticeAbility diagnoses. 
As the daughter of singer-songwriters James Taylor and Carly Simon, Taylor&#x27;s birth was mentioned in the song &quot;Sarah Maria&quot; on James Taylor&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Gorilla&quot;. Carly Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Hotcakes&quot;, released in January 1974, contains a song called &quot;Think I&#x27;m Gonna Have a Baby&quot;, and the cover photo is a study of a pregnant Simon.

Taylor graduated from Tabor Academy, a college-preparatory boarding school in Marion, Massachusetts. She attended Brown University, studying medical anthropology.

Taylor and her family now reside in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

<doc id="1219948" wikidata="Q3717396" url="?curid=1219948" title="EMS Synthi 100">
<text>The EMS Synthi 100 was a large analogue/digital hybrid synthesizer made by Electronic Music Studios, London, originally as a custom order from Radio Belgrade for what was to be the Radio Belgrade Electronic Studio, largely thanks to contact between composer Paul Pignon, then living in Belgrade, and Peter Zinovieff. The synthesiser was designed by David Cockerell and documented in detail in 1971. The cost at that time was £6,500 (about £92,500 in 2020 Pounds). The last unit built by EMS was number 30. Afterwards, one final unit was built by Datanomics, who bought assets from EMS when the company folded in 1979. The redesigned unit was sold to Gabinete de Música Electroacústica, Cuenca, Spain.

Developed from an initial concept of three VCS3 systems, the analogue modules on their own more closely resemble six VCS3s. With the addition of the 256-step digital sequencer&#x27;s circuit cards, the card count rises to 85 (28 times larger than a VCS3 by circuit board count), with 12 voltage-controlled oscillators and eight voltage-controlled filters Two monophonic keyboards (both keyboards together produce four control voltages and two key triggers simultaneously). The digital sequencer has three (duophonic) layers, 10,000 clock events and 256 duophonic note events. Two 60 × 60 matrixes were used to connect the different modules by using patch pins. The keyboard spread could be adjusted, making it easy to play a tuned equal temperament scale as well as alternative microtonal tunings up to 61 divisions of each semitone.

The Synthi-100 was developed a few years after the first VCS3s. Both filters and oscillators were much more stable in the Synthi-100. There is an oscillator sync function that can sync the 12 main oscillators to each another or from an external source. The Synthi 100 also had an add-on computer interface known as &quot;Computer Synthi&quot; which contained a PDP-8 minicomputer and 4Kb of random access memory. It featured an LED display, twin digital cassettes, Two 24 × 60 matrix patchboards, and a switch button control panel. Only three were sold. The Vocoder 5000 (Studio Vocoder) was available as a separate module installed into the Synthi 100. It contained a 22 band filter, 22 × 22 matrix patchboard, mic/line inputs, two oscillators and noise sources, frequency shifter, pitch to voltage extractor, and a spectrum display driver.

The Synthi 100 owned by Jack Dangers can be heard being used extensively on electronica group Meat Beat Manifesto&#x27;s album &quot;R.U.O.K.?&quot;. Many photos from that album&#x27;s CD sleeve are close-up photos of the Synthi 100&#x27;s control panels and displays.

A Synthi 100 (formally from Melodia Radio) is on display at the National Music Centre in Calgary, Canada. Until recently The Music Department of the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada, also possessed a Synthi 100.

The BBC Radiophonic Workshop already had an informal relationship with EMS which went back as far as 1964 and were familiar with products being developed. They took delivery of an EMS Synthi 100 modular system in 1970 which had been modified to BBC specifications, dubbing it the &quot;Delaware&quot;, after the name of the road outside the studio. Their composer Malcolm Clarke was one of its most enthusiastic users. One of the more notable scores he produced with the Synthi 100 was the incidental music for the 1972 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Sea Devils&quot;.

The first classical electronic music LP album generated exclusively on the Synthi 100 was released by Composers Recordings, Inc. in 1975. Called &quot;American Contemporary-Electronic Music&quot; (CRI SD 335), it featured full LP side lengths of music from Barton McLean (Spirals) and Priscilla McLean (Dance of Dawn).

The WDR Electronic Music Studio ordered a Synthi 100 in 1973, and it was delivered the next year It was used by Karlheinz Stockhausen in &quot;Sirius&quot; (1975–77), by Rolf Gehlhaar for &quot;Fünf deutsche Tänze&quot; (1975), by John McGuire for &quot;Pulse Music III&quot; (1978), and by York Höller for &quot;Mythos&quot; for 13 instruments, percussion, and electronic sounds (1979–80).

The first one to be used in the USA was purchased by Stevie Wonder. Billy Corgan, longtime frontman of the Smashing Pumpkins, is also reported to own one.
The University of Osnabrück, Germany, has a Synthi 100 variant labelled &quot;Synthi 200&quot; (since 1981). The same variant was bought in 1973 by the Bulgarian National Radio for the electronic music studio of Simo Lazarov.

IPEM, the musicology research center and former electroacoustic music production studio of Ghent University also owns a restored and working Synthi 100. It was acquired in the mid 1970s. Recently it was used by Soulwax, an electronic music band.

In 2017, Yoshio Machida and Constantin Papageorgiadis released an album &quot;Music from the SYNTHI 100&quot;. This album was made with IPEM&#x27;s SYNTHI 100.

Eduard Artemyev, Yuri Bogdanov and Vladimir Martynov used the Synthi 100 owned by Soviet label &quot;Melodia&quot; for their record &quot;Metamorphoses - Electronic interpretations of classic and modern musical works&quot;.
Also Lithuanian composer Giedrius Kuprevičius for their rock-oratorio &quot;Labour and Bread&quot; (1978) and Estonian composer Sven Grünberg for the soundtrack of &quot;Hukkunud Alpinisti hotell&quot; (&quot;Dead Mountaineer&#x27;s Hotel&quot;) (1979) as mentioned in the title sequence of the movie.

Wolfgang Dauner has extensively used a Synthi 100, e.g., on his Album &quot;Changes&quot; (1978).

Sarah Davachi released her album &quot;Vergers&quot; in November 2016 by Important Records centred largely on the EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer.

A Synthi 100, owned by the Greek Contemporary Music Research Center, was restored and exhibited in Athens Conservatoire as part of the Documenta 14 in 2017.

According to official documents from Radio Belgrade and interview with Cockerell Synthi 100 was built as a commission by Radio Belgrade. It has been part of Radio Belgrade&#x27;s Electronic Studio since the 1970s, but was in a non-functional state for the 15 years leading up to October 4, 2017, when it was restored. It is serial number 4.

The University of Melbourne&#x27;s Synthi 100 has been regularly used in performances and demonstrations since it was restored by Tonmeister Les Craythorn.

The Musikhochschule Stuttgart has had a late Synthi 100 since new. It has been in constant teaching use from arrival in 1977 to the present day.

In September 2016, Engineers Australia awarded an Engineering Heritage Marker to a Synthi 100 that had been restored at Melbourne University.

Synthi-100 Nr. 7 was delivered to Bruno Spoerri in Zürich, Switzerland in August 1971. It was featured in the album &quot;Switched-on Switzerland&quot; (CBS 1974), &quot;Voice of Taurus&quot; (1976) and later on the album &quot;Toy Planet&quot; by Bruno Spoerri and Irmin Schmidt, also in numerous TV and film features. The Synthi was given to Felix Visser in 1987 - he had to sell it and it is unknown, where it is now.

<doc id="1219965" wikidata="Q324438" url="?curid=1219965" title="War of the Pyrenees">
<text>The War of the Pyrenees, also known as War of Roussillon or War of the Convention, was the Pyrenean front of the First Coalition&#x27;s war against the First French Republic. It pitted Revolutionary France against the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal from March 1793 to July 1795 during the French Revolutionary Wars.

The war was fought in the eastern and western Pyrenees, at the French port of Toulon, and at sea. In 1793, a Spanish army invaded Roussillon in the eastern Pyrenees and maintained itself on French soil through April 1794. The French Revolutionary Army drove the Spanish Army back into Catalonia and inflicted a serious defeat in November 1794. After February 1795, the war in the eastern Pyrenees became a stalemate. In the western Pyrenees, the French began to win in 1794. By 1795, the French army controlled a portion of northeast Spain.

The war was brutal in at least two ways. The Committee of Public Safety decreed that all French royalist prisoners be executed. Also, French generals who lost battles or otherwise displeased the representatives-on-mission often faced prison or execution. Commanders of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees were especially unlucky in this regard.

==Outbreak==
On 21 January 1793, the National Convention of France executed Louis XVI by guillotine, enraging the other monarchs of Europe. France was already at war with the Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Kingdom of Sardinia. After winning the Battle of Jemappes, the French army occupied the Austrian Netherlands. Emboldened, the French government decreed annexation of the territory (modern Belgium), provoking a diplomatic break with Great Britain. On 1 February, France declared war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. On 7 March, France declared war on its former ally, Spain.

===Toulon===
Spanish forces took part in the Siege of Toulon, which lasted from 18 September to 18 December 1793. The French were led by Jacques François Dugommier, and the Anglo-Spanish defenders were commanded by admirals Juan de Lángara, Federico Gravina, Samuel Hood and General Charles O&#x27;Hara. The Allies abandoned the port after a young officer of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte, brought the fleet&#x27;s anchorage under cannon fire. The French navy lost 14 ships of the line burned and 15 more captured. French casualties numbered 2,000, and Allied losses were twice as great. Afterward, the victors massacred up to 2,000 French royalists, who had been taken prisoner.

==Naval action==
The Action of 14 February 1795 in the Gulf of Roses was a defeat for the French navy.

==Eastern Pyrenees==
At the outbreak of war, King Charles IV of Spain appointed Captain General Antonio Ricardos to command the Army of Catalonia in the eastern Pyrenees. Ricardos invaded the Cerdagne and captured Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans on 17 April 1793. Three days later, he routed a French force at Céret on the Tech. In despair, the elderly French commander in charge of Roussillon, Mathieu Henri Marchant de La Houlière, committed suicide. On 30 April, the French government divided the Army of the Pyrenees into the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees and the Army of the Western Pyrenees.

In the Battle of Mas Deu on 19 May 1793, Ricardos defeated Louis-Charles de Flers, which allowed the Spanish to invest the Fort de Bellegarde on 23 May. The Siege of Bellegarde ended by the French garrison surrendering on 24 June. During the Battle of Perpignan on 17 July, de Flers turned back the Spanish though French losses were heavier. On 28 August, Luc Siméon Auguste Dagobert defeated a Spanish force under Manuel la Peña at Puigcerdà in the Cerdagne.

In September, Ricardos sent two divisions under Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarilas and Juan de Courten to cut off the fortress of Perpignan. However, Eustache Charles d&#x27;Aoust rallied the French to win the Battle of Peyrestortes on 17 September. That represented the farthest Spanish advance in Roussillon. Five days later, Ricardos defeated Dagobert at the Battle of Truillas before he fell back to the Tech Valley. Ricardos repulsed d&#x27;Aoust at Le Boulou on 3 October. The Battle of the Tech (Pla del Rei) on 13–15 October saw the Spanish repel the assaults of Louis Marie Turreau. A 5,000-man Portuguese division led by John Forbes joined Ricardos in time to defeat d&#x27;Aoust at the Battle of Villelongue-dels-Monts on 7 December. At the Battle of Collioure, Gregorio García de la Cuesta captured the ports of Collioure and Port-Vendres from the French on 20 December.

Ricardos died on 6 March 1794, and Spanish success died with him. Captain General Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly died ten days after the man whom he was to succeed, and Luis Firmin de Carvajal, Conde de la Union was appointed to command the Army of Catalonia instead. The Army of the Eastern Pyrenees also had a new commander, Jacques François Dugommier. At the Battle of Boulou, from 29 April to 1 May, Dugommier drove de la Union&#x27;s army south of the border and forced the Spanish to abandon all their artillery and trains. Collioure fell to the French in late May and Eugenio Navarro&#x27;s 7,000-man Spanish garrison became prisoners. The French royalist defenders fled in fishing boats before the surrender to avoid execution. Dugommier imposed a blockade on Bellegarde starting on 5 May. The inconclusive Battle of La Junquera was fought on 7 June. At the Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga (Sant Llorenç de la Muga) on 13 August, Pierre Augereau repulsed a Spanish attempt to relieve Bellegarde. The fortress fell on 17 September after the Spanish garrison had been starved out. From 17 to 20 November, the climactic Battle of the Black Mountain saw both Dugommier and de la Union killed in action. Dominique-Catherine de Pérignon took command of the French and led them to victory. Figueres and its Sant Ferran Fortress quickly fell to the French with 9,000 prisoners.

Pierre François Sauret successfully concluded the Siege of Roses on 4 February 1795. Pérignon was replaced in army command by Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. On 14 June 1795, Schérer was defeated near the Fluvià River by José de Urrutia y de las Casas at the Battle of Bascara. After peace was signed but before word had reached the fighting front, Cuesta recaptured Puigcerdà and Bellver from the French on 26 and 27 July.

==Western Pyrenees==
A number of minor clashes occurred in 1793, including actions fought by Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey&#x27;s 5th Light Demi-Brigade at Chateau-Pignon on 6 June, Aldudes in June, and Saint-Jean-de-Luz on 23 July.

On 5 February 1794, at the Battle of Sans Culottes Camp, the French successfully defended a fortified hilltop position near Hendaye against 13,000 Spanish infantry and 700 cavalry and artillery led by José Urrutia y de las Casas. Spanish casualties numbered 335, and French losses were 235. On 3 June, a 2,300-man French brigade commanded by Lavictoire stormed the Casa Fuerte position at Izpegi Pass (Col d&#x27;Ispeguy) 13.5 km west of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. The 1,000 defenders, including a battalion of the Spanish &quot;Zamora&quot; Infantry Regiment, three companies of the &quot;Aldudes&quot; Rifles, and the French émigré &quot;Légion Royal&quot; battalion, lost 94 killed and wounded, and 307 were captured. The losses of the French brigade, which were part of Mauco&#x27;s division, were described as &quot;light&quot;. The same day, Jacques Lefranc&#x27;s 2,000 French Republican troops seized the Izpegi Ridge.

On 3 March 1794, the bordering villages of Sara, Itxassou, Ascain and another nine Basque villages were declared &quot;ignoble&quot; by the republican authorities after 74 young residents, instead of watching the border for the French army, had fled south to the Spanish Basque region. All of the villages&#x27; inhabitants were held accountable for the flight, and draconian measures were imposed on them. All inhabitants of the villages 3 to 88 were crammed in carts like criminals and carried off to the Landes of Gascony. Men and women were segregated, and their valuable possessions seized or burnt. The victims of the massive deportation may amount to several thousand, and in five months, some 1,600 had died, 600 being from Sara. In a few years, many survivors would manage to return home.

On 23 June, Captain General Ventura Caro with 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry and artillery tried unsuccessfully to oust a French force from a fortified position atop Mont Calvaire. The Spanish suffered 500 killed and wounded, as well as 34 captured. The French admitted 30 killed and 200 wounded. On 10 July, Antoine Digonet with a brigade of 4,000 troops overwhelmed the &quot;Zamora&quot; Infantry and the &quot;Légion Royal&quot; defending Mount Argintzu (Mont Arquinzu), at , 10 km south of Elizondo. Spanish losses numbered 314, and the French royalist commander, Marquis de Saint-Simon, was badly wounded. The French Republicans executed 49 French royalist prisoners.

On 23 July, the Army of the Western Pyrenees attacked Spanish fortified positions with the divisions of Moncey, Henri François Delaborde, and Jean Henri Guy Nicolas de Frégeville. Jacques Léonard Muller commanded the army at the time, but Moncey exercised tactical control of operations during the Battle of the Baztan Valley. In the fighting near Elizondo and Doneztebe (Santesteban), Moncey overran the Spanish defenses. The French then followed the Bidasoa river northward in late July to seize the heights of San Marcial and the town of Hondarribia (Fuenterrabia), near the coast. In the latter operation, Moncey captured Don Vicente de los Reyes, 2,000 Spanish soldiers and 300 cannon on 1 August. Moncey followed the exploit by capturing San Sebastián without resistance on 3 August, with an additional 1,700 Spanish soldiers and 90 cannon falling into French hands. Soon afterward, the French also captured the town of Tolosa, and Moncey was soon promoted to army commander.

On 14 August 1794, the General Assembly of Gipuzkoa reunited in the coastal town of Getaria with the support of the San Sebastián bourgeoisie, followed by tense negotiations with senior officials of the French army. Besides embracing the French revolutionary ideas, the council made a formal petition: detachment from the Kingdom of Spain, respect for the region specific laws, allegiance of Gipuzkoa to France, free Catholic practice and a set of rules for the management of war-related circumstances. However, with negotiations leading to the Peace of Basel being in place, the French army&#x27;s representatives of the National Convention, Jacques Pinet and Jean-Baptiste Cavaignac refused to accept the demands, and the Gipuzkoan representatives were imprisoned or exiled. Given the circumstances, another assembly was held in Mondragón on 13 September in which the attending regional representatives decided this time to support Ferdinand VII and mustered an autonomous provincial militia against the French army. However, on an unspecified date soon afterward, the more diplomatic Moncey restored the governing institutions of Gipuzkoa. The news of the declaration issued in Getaria by the Gipuzkoan representatives spread like fire to Madrid and sparked outrage in Spanish ruling circles and press, which lashed out at the Basque province and its inhabitants. Also, after the imprisonment in Bayonne, the Gipuzkoan representatives were persecuted by Spanish authorities and tried on high treason charges and &quot;unpatriotic behaviour&quot;.

From 15 to 17 October, Moncey, launched a broad front offensive from the Baztan Valley and the Roncevaux Pass to the south toward Pamplona. The Battle of Orbaitzeta saw clashes at Mezkiritz (Mezquiriz), Orbaitzeta, Lekunberri and Villanueva (Hiriberri). The 46,000-man French army drove back 13,000 Spanish troops under the command of Pedro Téllez-Girón, 9th Duke of Osuna, with 4,000 casualties and the loss of 50 cannon. French losses are unknown. The arms foundries at Orbaitzeta and Eugi, as well as the Spanish navy&#x27;s mast store at Irati, fell to the French. However, the onset of winter weather and the outbreak of disease caused operations to be suspended for the year. A final clash occurred at Bergara on 7 November in which the French inflicted losses of 150 killed and 200 men and one cannon captured on a 4,000-man division led by Cayetano Pignatelli, 3rd Marquis of Rubí. The town was sacked, but a detachment of the territorial militia, led by Gabriel Mendizabal, who was to be promoted to general during the Peninsular War, managed to recapture it.

During the winter, Moncey reorganised his army, which had lost 3,000 men to disease. He finally secured a siege train and in June 1795, 12,000 reinforcements arrived from the Army of the West. Moncey&#x27;s offensive began on 28 June and soon drove back Crespo&#x27;s Spanish forces. Vitoria fell to the French on 17 July and Bilbao two days later. When news of the Peace of Basel arrived in early August, Moncey had crossed the Ebro and was preparing to invest Pamplona.

==Conclusion==
The Peace of Basel ended the war on 22 July 1795, with Moncey close on the gates of Pamplona, the Basques fearing abolition of their self-government and Spanish Prime Minister Manuel Godoy panicking at the prospect of the still-autonomous Basque region switching allegiances to France and detaching from Spain. In the peace, Spain gave up the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola in exchange for keeping Gipuzkoa. Additionally, at the behest of Moncey and the Committee of Public Safety (Jean-Lambert Tallien), an annex was added to the treaty by which the Spanish Basques and specifically the Gipuzkoans, who had shown sympathies for the French, were given guarantees of receiving no reprisals from Spanish authorities, which was agreed. Notwithstanding that provision, at least the city council of San Sebastián was arrested and put to a court-martial trial in Pamplona that was held as of February 1796.

Under the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso on 19 August 1796, an alliance was established between France and Spain. However, peace was not concluded with the Portuguese, who remained part of the anti-French coalition.

<text>CSS Ellis (later USS Ellis) was a gunboat in the Confederate States Navy and the United States Navy during the American Civil War. It was lost during a raid while under command of famed Navy officer Lieutenant William B. Cushing.

== Confederate Service ==

The &quot;Ellis&quot; was purchased at Norfolk, Virginia in 1861 by the State of North Carolina and turned over to the Confederacy when that State became a member. With Commander W. T. Muse, CSN, in command, she played an important part in the defense of Fort Hatteras and Fort Clark in Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina on August 28–29, 1861, of Roanoke Island on February 7–8, 1862, and of Elizabeth City, North Carolina on February 10, 1862; that day she was captured by the Union Army after a desperate struggle in which her commander, Lieutenant James W. Cooke, CSN, was badly wounded.

== U.S. Navy Service ==

&quot;Ellis&quot; was taken into the U.S. Navy and assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She was placed under the command of Lieutenant C. L. Franklin, USN, and spent her entire U.S. Navy service in the sounds and rivers of North Carolina.

&quot;Ellis&quot; took part in a combined expedition which captured Fort Macon, near Beaufort, North Carolina, on April 25, 1862. She had a brief engagement with Confederate cavalry off Winton, North Carolina on June 27, 1862, and from August 15 to 19, 1862, she made an expedition to Swansboro, North Carolina, to destroy salt works and a battery. On October 14, 1862, she was detailed to the blockade of Bogue Inlet, and a week later, captured and burned the schooner &quot;Adelaide&quot; with a valuable cargo of turpentine, cotton, and tobacco.

== Final Action ==

In November 1862, &quot;Ellis&quot;, under command of Lieutenant William B. Cushing, sailed up New River Inlet to capture Jacksonville, North Carolina. The steamer captured two schooners, some arms and mail. On her way down river, &quot;Ellis&quot; ran aground on November 24, 1862, and could not be re-floated. After dark, her commanding officer moved all the crew except six and all her equipment and supplies except her pivot gun, some ammunition, two tons of coal, and a few small arms to one of the captured schooners. While the schooners slipped down the river to wait, Cushing and five of his men remained to fight it out. Early on the morning of November 25, 1862, the Confederates opened fire on &quot;Ellis&quot;, and in a short time, Cushing was forced to decide between surrender and a pull of a mile and a half to a waiting schooner. Cushing chose not to surrender, and before leaving his ship, set fire to her in five places, leaving the gun trained on the enemy to let the ship herself carry on the fight when flames would fire the cannon. Cushing and his men reached the schooner and made for the sea, getting the vessel over the bar just in time to escape several companies of cavalry trying to cut off the schooner at the mouth of the inlet. &quot;Ellis&quot; was blown to pieces by the explosion of her magazine on the morning of November 25, 1862.

<text>Geoffrey Heneage Drummond, VC (25 January 1886 – 21 April 1941) was a British land agent, businessman, sailor, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and First World War==
Drummond was born on 25 January 1886. He was 32 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his part in the Second Ostend Raid.

On 9/10 May 1918 at Ostend, Belgium, Lieutenant Drummond commanding HMML (Motor Launch) 254, volunteered for rescue work and was following HMS &quot;Vindictive&quot; to the harbour when a shell burst on board killing an officer and a deck hand and badly wounding the coxswain and Lieutenant Drummond. Notwithstanding his wounds, this officer brought M.L. 254 alongside &quot;Vindictive&quot; and then took off two officers and 38 men, some of whom were killed or wounded while embarking. He retained consciousness long enough to back his vessel away from the piers and towards the open sea before collapsing exhausted from his wounds.

==Post-war==
Drummond married Maude Aylmer Tindal Bosanquet (d 27 Sept, 1967) on 2 July 1918.

Despite suffering from his severe wounds received in his VC action, Drummond served with the Royal Naval Patrol Service in the Second World War.

Drummond died on 21 April 1941 from a fall. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>William Dunstan, VC (2 March 1895 – 8 March 1957) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces.

==Biography==
Dunstan was born on 8 March 1895. He was 20 years old and a corporal in the 7th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force during the First World War when he was awarded the VC for his actions on 9 August 1915, during the Battle of Lone Pine on Gallipoli, Turkey. During the action Turkish forces had made a determined counter-attack on the centre of the newly captured trench held by a lieutenant, Frederick Harold Tubb, two corporals (Alexander Stewart Burton and Corporal Dunstan), and a few men. The Turkish blew in the sand-bag barricade, leaving only a foot standing, but Tubb, Burton and Dunstan repelled them and rebuilt the barricade. Twice more the Turkish blew in the barricade and on each occasion they were repelled and the barricade rebuilt.

Dunstan was blind for almost a year after Lone Pine. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant. Before the war, Dunstan had been a messenger boy in a draper&#x27;s shop. After the war he worked for the Repatriation Department in Melbourne and in 1921 joined the staff of &quot;The Herald and Weekly Times&quot; as an accountant. He rose to become its general manager. He died on 2 March 1957.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. In 1995 a Memorial to Dunstan was erected in Sturt St, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The &quot;Dunstan VC Club&quot; at Puckapunyal is named in his honour. He was survived by his wife, Marjorie, and three children, William &quot;Bill&quot; Dunstan, Helen McIntosh and the prominent journalist and writer Keith Dunstan.

==Medals==

Dunstan was awarded:
*Victoria Cross
*1914–15 Star

*Victory Medal with oakleaf (MID)

<text>Lieutenant Frederic Brooks Dugdale VC (21 October 1877 – 13 November 1902) was an English British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Dugdale was born in 1877, the youngest son of Colonel James Dugdale, of Sezincot, Moreton in the Marsh, Gloucestershire. He was commissioned into the British Army as a second-lieutenant in the 5th Lancers in October 1899. The outbreak of the Second Boer War the same month saw the regiment sent to South Africa, where they took part in the Ladysmith Relief Column. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in May 1900.

He was 23 years old serving during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place on 3 March 1901 near Derby, South Africa for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.
He had a severe attack of enteric fever, and after his recovery served with General John French in the Cape Colony. Staying with his regiment in South Africa until the war ended in May 1902, he then left for the United Kingdom on the &quot;SS Briton&quot; two months later. Shortly after his return, he was killed in a horse riding accident whilst riding with the North Cotswold Hounds, near Charingworth, Gloucestershire, England, on 13 November 1902. He was buried at Longborough, near Moreton in Marsh.

<text>John Frederick McCrea VC (2 April 1854 – 16 July 1894) was an English-born South African soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
McCrea was born on 2 April 1854 at Saint Peter Port, Guernsey to Captain Herbert Taylor McCrea and Elizabeth Dobree Carey. Following his parents&#x27; deaths in 1855, he was brought up by his aunt Charlotte in Guernsey and educated at Elizabeth College. He then studied medicine at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, qualifying in 1878 as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and Edinburgh.

In 1879 he went to South Africa, where he did duty at the Military Hospital in Cape Town as Civilian Surgeon to Her Majesty&#x27;s Forces. A year later he moved to Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape to settle, but decided instead to join the 1st Regiment, Cape Mounted Yeomanry as a surgeon.

==Details==

McCrea was 26 years old, and a Surgeon in the 1st Cape Mounted Yeomanry, Cape Colonial Forces during the Basuto Gun War, when he performed the following actions for which he was awarded the VC.

On 14 January 1881, at Tweefontein, Basutoland, South Africa, the burghers had been forced to retire under a most determined enemy attack, with a loss of 16 killed and 21 wounded. Surgeon McCrea was the only doctor present and notwithstanding a serious wound on the breast bone, which he dressed himself, he most gallantly took the casualties into shelter and continued to attend to the wounded throughout the day. Had it not been for this devotion to duty on the part of Surgeon McCrea, there would undoubtedly have been much greater suffering and loss of life.

==Further career==
McCrea was promoted to the rank of Surgeon Major and on 3 February 1882 was transferred to the Cape Mounted Riflemen.

He remained with the regiment and married a South African, Elizabeth Antoinette (Bessie) Watermeyer. He died of heart failure at his home in Kokstad, Cape Colony on 16 July 1894. His widow died on 5 November 1936 in Exmouth, Devon. She was buried in Littleham, Exmouth.

Photos of McCrea exist in the Cape Town Military Museum and in the South African National Museum of Military History. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft VC Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

A painting of McCrea winning his Victoria Cross was completed by Eric Wale of Cape Town for the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) in Millbank, United Kingdom.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel George Vincent Fosbery VC (11 April 1832 – 8 May 1907) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was also a designer and inventor of firearms.

==Military background==
An Old Etonian, Fosbery was 31 years old, and a lieutenant in the 4th Bengal European Regiment, British Indian Army during the Umbeyla Campaign during which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He retired from the service in 1877 having achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

===Umbeyla Campaign===

On 30 October 1863 during the Umbeyla Campaign, North-West India, Lieutenant Fosbery led a party of his regiment to recapture the Crag Picquet, after its garrison had been driven in by the enemy and 60 of them killed. The approach to the Crag was very narrow but the lieutenant led his party with great coolness, and was the first man to gain the top of the Crag from his side of the attack. Subsequently, when the commanding officer was wounded, Lieutenant Fosbery assembled a party and pursued the routed enemy, inflicting on them further losses.
==Inventions==
In 1895 he patented a design for a self-cocking revolver, which was taken up by the Webley &amp; Scott Revolver &amp; Arms Company. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver was produced as a six-shot .455 caliber and an eight-shot .38 caliber. 

In 1885 he patented the Paradox gun. The Paradox design was adopted and produced by the famous gunmaker&#x27;s Holland &amp; Holland, and so named because only the front two inches of the barrel were rifled; intended to be used as both rifle and shotgun, capable of firing both shot and conical bullets with accuracy.

Marketed by Holland and Holland throughout the British empire for hunting, it was used most prominently in India with the advantage of being powerful enough for tiger, and also able to fire birdshot for snipe. When Fosbury&#x27;s patent ran out in the late 19th Century, other makers adopted the design, most famously Westley-Richards with their &quot;Explora&quot; model.

==Medals==
In 1997, Fosbery&#x27;s Victoria Cross was sold at an Alberta auction for $45,000. His medals are now on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<doc id="1219981" wikidata="Q193866" url="?curid=1219981" title="Annals">
<text>Annals (, from , &quot;year&quot;) are a concise historical record in which events are arranged chronologically, year by year, although the term is also used loosely for any historical record.

==Scope==
The nature of the distinction between annals and history is a subject based on divisions established by the ancient Romans. Verrius Flaccus, quoted by Aulus Gellius, stated that the etymology of &quot;history&quot; (from Greek , , equated with Latin , &quot;to inquire in person&quot;) properly restricts it to primary sources such as Thucydides&#x27;s which have come from the author&#x27;s own observations, while annals record the events of earlier times arranged according to years. Hayden White distinguishes annals from chronicles, which organize their events by topics such as the reigns of kings, and from histories, which aim to present and conclude a narrative implying the moral importance of the events recorded. Generally speaking, annalists record events drily, leaving the entries unexplained and equally weighted.

==History==

===Ancient===
The chief sources of information in regard to the annals of ancient Rome are two passages in Cicero and in Servius which have been the subject of much discussion. Cicero states that, from the founding of the Republic down to the pontificate of Publius Mucius Scaevola ( BC), it was usual for the pontifex maximus to record the name of the magistrates and the noteworthy events of each year on a white tablet (an ), which was exhibited in an open place at his house so that the people might read it. Servius states the events were written for each day. In the late Republic, these were known as the . After the pontificate of Publius, annals were compiled by various unofficial writers, of whom Cicero names Cato, Pictor, and Piso. These annals have been generally regarded as the same with the cited by Livy, but there seems reason to believe that the two were distinct, with the being fuller and more circumstantial. Verrius Flaccus&#x27;s division of genres is borne out in the common division of Tacitus&#x27;s works into &quot;Annals&quot; and &quot;Histories&quot;, although he did not use those titles to refer to his own works.

===Medieval===

Among the early Christians, it was common to establish the date of Easter by asking local Jews for the date of Passover (Nisan 14 in the Jewish calendar) and either using that date or the nearest Sunday to it. By the end of the 3rd century, this date sometimes occurred before the spring equinox and frequently varied from city to city. Following the 325 Council of Nicaea, Easter tables began to be drawn up according to various methods of computing Easter, often running from the Passion until decades or centuries into the future. Beginning in Ireland, Wales, and England in the 7th century, monks began to briefly note important events of the year as marginalia in these tables. Thereafter the compilation of annals became by and large a monastic activity, with the earliest recorded monastic annals being compiled in Ireland and known as the &quot;Chronicle of Ireland&quot;. Not all early annalistic texts, however, were monastic, and some in fact were made under royal patronage. For example, what is now called the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a text concerned mainly with the activities of kings, was written in annalistic form. Other examples of insular annals, written under various kinds of patronage, include the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, the &quot;Annals of Innisfallen&quot;, and the &quot;Annals of Wales&quot; ().

Introduced by insular missionaries to the continent, these texts were recopied, augmented, and continued, especially in Austrasia. During the 9th-century Carolingian Renaissance, they became the usual form of contemporary history: major examples include the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;, the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot; (), the &quot;Annals of St Bertin&quot; (), and the &quot;Annals of Lorsch&quot; (). As the annals developed into fuller and more descriptive entries, they became more indistinguishable from chronicles, although the term was still used for various works, such as the Annals of Waverley.

===Modern===
In modern literature, the term &quot;annals&quot; is similarly loosely applied to works which more or less strictly adhere to the order of years, both in western contexts (English &quot;Annual Registers&quot;, French , German ) and to equivalent styles in other cultures (such as the Chinese Spring and Autumn Annals).

It is also applied to various periodicals, particularly peer-reviewed journals in the sciences, after the model of Lavoisier&#x27;s &quot;Annales de chimie et de physique&quot;.

<text>Major General Henry Robert Bowreman Foote, (5 December 1904 – 11 November 1993) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Foote was born on 5 December 1904 in Ishapore, India, the son of Henry Bruce Foote, a major in the Royal Artillery, and his wife Jennie Elizabeth. He was the grandson of the archaeologist and geologist Robert Bruce Foote, often considered the &quot;Father of Indian Prehistory&quot;.

Foote&#x27;s mother died when he was a child and he went to England to board at St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Eastbourne at the age of four. In 1918 he went to Bedford School where he stayed until 1923.

==Military career==
Foote entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from where he graduated on 29 January 1925, and was subsequently commissioned into the Royal Tank Corps (later the Royal Tank Regiment).

===Second World War===
Foote was a Staff Officer from 1939 to 1942 and a member of the British Army Staff Mission, Washington, D.C. in 1941. In 1942 he was appointed Commanding Officer 7th Royal Tank Regiment and it was in this post that he won the Victoria Cross at the Battle of Gazala.

During the period 27 May to 15 June 1942 in Libya, Lieutenant-Colonel Foote commanded his battalion with outstanding courage and leadership, always being at the crucial point at the right time. On 6 June, although wounded, he continued to lead his battalion from an exposed position on the outside of a tank, and succeeded in defeating the enemy&#x27;s attempt to encircle two Allied divisions. On 13 June, when a number of Allied tanks had been destroyed, he went on foot, &quot;from one tank to another, to encourage the crews under intense artillery and anti-tank fire&quot;. By &quot;his magnificent example the corridor was kept open and the Brigade was able to march through&quot;.
Shortly after this, Foote was captured and became a prisoner of war. However, he subsequently escaped and entered Switzerland in April 1944. It was only then that he learned he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. After a period as a General Staff Officer at Allied Forces Headquarters in 1944, he became second-in-command of the 9th Armoured Brigade in 1945.

===Post-war and senior command===
After the end of the war, Foote was flying to Berlin to take part in a victory parade when he had to bail out, as the aircraft was about to crash. Consequently, he became a member of the Caterpillar Club, an informal group of those who have been saved from death or serious injury by means of a parachute.

Foote was Brigadier of the Royal Armoured Corps, Middle East Land Forces from 1945 to 1947 and then Officer Commanding 2nd Royal Tank Regiment from 1947 to 1948. He was at the Fighting Vehicles Proving Establishment, at the Ministry of Supply from 1948 to 1949 and commanded the 7th Armoured Brigade from 1949 to 1950 and the 11th Armoured Division from 1950 to 1953. He was Director General of Fighting Vehicles at the Ministry of Supply from 1953 to 1955 and Director, Royal Armoured Corps, at the War Office from 1955 until his retirement in 1958 as major-general.

==Retirement and legacy==
After his retirement, Foote was a trustee of The Tank Museum, Bovington until his death. He was featured as a guest on the biographical television programme This Is Your Life on 22 October 1986.

His medals are displayed at the Royal Tank Regiment Museum, Bovington, Dorset.

<doc id="1219992" wikidata="Q920364" url="?curid=1219992" title="George Rodger">
<text>George William Adam Rodger (19 March 1908 – 24 July 1995) was a British photojournalist. He was noted for his work in Africa, and for photographing mass deaths at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during the end of the World War II.

==Life and career==

Born in Hale, Cheshire, of English, Scottish, German and Swiss descent, Rodger went to school at St. Bees School in Cumberland. He joined the British Merchant Navy and sailed around the world. While sailing, Rodger wrote accounts of his travels and taught himself photography to illustrate his travelogues. He was unable to get his travel writing published; after a short spell in the United States, where he failed to find work during the Depression, Rodger returned to Britain in 1936. In London, he found work as a photographer for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine. In 1938 he had a brief stint working for the Black Star Agency.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, Rodger had a strong urge to chronicle the war. His photographs of the Blitz gained him a job as a war correspondent for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, based in the United States. Rodger covered the war in West Africa extensively and, towards the end of the war, followed the Allies&#x27; liberation of France, Belgium and Netherlands. He also covered the retreat of the British forces in Burma. He was probably the only British war reporter/photographer allowed to write a story on the Burma Road by travelling on it into China, with special permission from the Chinese military.

Rodger was one of many photographers to enter the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen in 1945, the first being members of the British Army Film and Photographic Unit. His photographs of the survivors and piles of corpses were published in &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazines and were highly influential in showing the reality of the death camps. Rodger later recalled how, after spending several hours at the camp, he was appalled to realise that he had spent most of the time looking for graphically pleasing compositions of the piles of bodies lying among the trees and buildings. 
This traumatic experience led Rodger to conclude that he could not work as a war correspondent again. Leaving &quot;Life&quot;, he travelled throughout Africa and the Middle East, continuing to document these areas&#x27; wildlife and peoples.
== Founding member of Magnum Photos and work in Africa ==
In 1947, Rodger became a founding member of Magnum Photos. Over the next thirty years, he worked as a freelance photographer, taking on many expeditions and assignments to photograph the people, landscape and nature of African nations. Much of Rodger&#x27;s photojournalism in Africa was published in &quot;National Geographic&quot; as well as other magazines and newspapers.

His photographs made in 1948 and 1949 of indigenous people of the Nuba mountains, in the Sudanese province of Kordofan, and the Latuka and other tribes of southern Sudan, have been called &quot;some of the most historically important and influential images taken in sub-Saharan Africa during the twentieth century&quot;. As Rodger wrote several years later, &quot;When we came to leave the Nuba Jebels (mountains), we took with us only memories of a people ... so much more hospitable, chivalrous and gracious than many of us who live in the &#x27;Dark Continents&#x27; outside Africa.&quot; In 1951, Rodger published his photo essay on the Nuba and Latuka also in &quot;National Geographic&quot;. In the 1960s, his pictures prompted controversial German photographer and filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl to travel to the Nuba mountains for her own photo stories on the Nuba people.

A retrospective exhibition of Rodger&#x27;s work was held at Imperial War Museum North in 2008.

===Marriage, family===
Rodger&#x27;s first wife, Cicely, who travelled extensively with him in Africa, died during childbirth in 1949. In 1952, he married his American assistant Lois &quot;Jinx&quot; Witherspoon and the pair had two sons, one of whom, Peter, became a filmmaker in Britain. He was the grandfather of Elliot Rodger, who committed the 2014 Isla Vista killings in California, United States, where he killed six people and injured fourteen others before committing suicide.

<doc id="1219994" wikidata="Q433963" url="?curid=1219994" title="Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)">
<text>Frederick I (, c. 1175 – 16 April 1198), known as Frederick the Catholic (), was the Duke of Austria from 1195 to 1198. He was a member of the House of Babenberg.

==Biography==
Frederick the Catholic was born in 1175, the son of Duke Leopold V of Austria and Helena of Hungary. In 1192, he was enfeoffed with his father with Austria and Styria, while the younger Leopold VI had no claim. On Leopold V&#x27;s death-bed, at Graz, he caught all by surprise by granting the Duchy of Styria to Leopold VI, with Emperor Henry VI&#x27;s approval. None raised objections and thus, Austria and Styria remained divided. Frederick the Catholic, however, did not receive his enfeoffment by the Emperor personally; instead he sent Wolfger of Erla, Bishop of Passau on his behalf.

As the new Duke finally received his land in 1195, he still faced the restitution of the English hostages and the ransom money paid for Richard of England&#x27;s life. Richard had been pressing hard for the return of both hostages and money, egged on by Adalbert III of Bohemia, Archbishop of Salzburg. The hostages were sent back at once, yet Frederick was unable to pay back the ransom money, despite returning the unspent portion. Upon the captivity of Richard Leopold V had forced Richard&#x27;s niece Eleanor into a marriage to Frederick and Eleanor was on the way to Austria, but upon this situation the marriage was cancelled and she was also sent back. Frederick willingly took upon himself the penance of another Crusade, in order to restore Babenberg honor in the eyes of the Catholic Church. And on Easter, 31 March 1195, he took the cross at Bari. With Saladin dead, in 1193, the prospects were favorable. Yet by March 1196, Pope Celestine III had intervened, approving of Adalbert&#x27;s conduct and severely censuring the late Duke Leopold V.
There were long delays before the Crusade would go under way. The German Emperor had been opting for his Erbreichsplan, a plan to make the Empire hereditary. He had been spending this time making deals, offering bribes and whatever means he could to both Princes of the Church and Empire to vote for a hereditary Empire, to no avail. In the end, the Emperor ceased his Hereditary plans to proceed with the Crusade.

Duke Frederick left Austria in April or late spring 1197 for the German Crusade of 1197 in the company of Wolfger, Bishop of Passau and his uncle, Henry I, Duke of Mödling. Frederick had stopped by Linaria to rest before moving on. When they left Apulia to reach Sicily, they were encouraged further, after two ships sunk at sea, with the Abbots of Werd and Beuern. By June, they were welcomed at Emperor Henry&#x27;s court in Sicily. There the Emperor took full command and instructed Conrad of Mainz to oversee the passage of the Crusader fleet. In September, they sailed under the leadership of Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz &amp; Chancellor of Germany from Messina and arrived weeks later to Acre, where command of the German forces was assumed under Conrad of Mainz and Marshal Henry of Kalden, whose presence brought the displeasure of the French forces under Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem. The German Princes, however, Frederick included, had denied the authority of Marshal Henry and had called for an election of a Commander. They called for Duke Henry I of Brabant to lead the assault against the Ayyubids under Al-Adil. Their forces rallied, and they marched on to Tyre, taking the city easily and then the wealthy city of Sidon before then invading Beirut and entering it on 24 October. Suddenly, news spread that King Henry I of Jerusalem had died from falling off the balcony of his palace in Acre. The German forces returned immediately to Acre and Duke Henry of Brabant acted as Regent. Time was not wasted and preparations were beginning to be made for Almaric of Cyprus to be made King of Jerusalem. Urged by the German Princes, Amalric married Isabella and was crowned in Acre King of Jerusalem in 1198.

The Germans marched forth again, reconquering the estates around Byblos Castle (Gibelet) and restoring the land link to the County of Tripoli. They marched against Damascus and even laid siege to Toron when suddenly, news had arrived of Emperor Henry VI&#x27;s death on Michaelmas Eve. Many German princes had immediately left for the Fatherland to receive confirmation of their lands by the new Emperor. Duke Frederick stayed on, with Wolfger, to continue the war. In the end, Frederick, along with the remaining Germans, had called for an armistice with Al-Adil, who acknowledged King Amalric&#x27;s rule over the reconquered lands.

Frederick fell ill and died on 16 April while returning from Palestine at Acre. Those who bore witness to his death were his companions, Meinhard II, Count of Gorizia, Wolfger, Bishop of Passau, Eberhard, Count of Dörnberg, Ulrich of Eppan and his most trusted attendant. He never married, but was very much beloved by his people, one such being Walther von der Vogelweide, who lamented him especially as Duke Leopold VI gave Walther a less cordial reception at his court.

Wolfger performed the German funeral custom, Mos Teutonicus, on him before bringing him back. He was then interred next to his father in Heiligenkreuz Abbey where they remain to this day, in peace.

<text>The Royal Drummers of Burundi, commonly known in recordings as The Drummers of Burundi or as The Master Drummers of Burundi, is a percussion ensemble originally from Burundi. Their performances are a part of ceremonies such as births, funerals, and coronations of &quot;mwami&quot; (Kings). Drums (called karyenda) are sacred in Burundi, and represent the mwami, fertility and regeneration. The Royal Drummers use drums made from hollowed tree trunks covered with animal skins. In addition to the central drum, called &quot;Inkiranya&quot;, there are &quot;Amashako&quot; drums which provide a continuous beat, and &quot;Ibishikiso&quot; drums, which follow the rhythm established by the Inkiranya.

The performance of the Royal Drummers has been the same for centuries, and their techniques and traditions are passed down from father to son. The members of the ensemble take turns playing the Inkiranya, dancing, resting, and playing the other drums, rotating throughout the show without interruptions. At the start of their performance, the drummers enter balancing the heavy drums on their heads and singing and playing. There are some extra members who carry ornamental spears and shields and lead the procession with their dance. They then perform a series of rhythms, some accompanied by song, and exit the stage the same way, carrying the drums on their heads and playing.

Beginning in the 1960s, the Drummers have toured the world. They have recorded at least three albums - &quot;Batimbo (Musiques Et Chants)&quot; in 1991,&quot;The Drummers of Burundi&quot; (1992, recorded 1987) &quot;Real World&quot; (retitled &quot;Live at Real World&quot; in 1993) and &quot;The Master Drummers of Burundi&quot; (1981 lp, 1994 cd). They have also appeared on Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; (1975), and on &quot;Zimbo&quot;, the B-side of the Echo &amp; the Bunnymen 12&quot; single of &quot;The Cutter&quot; (1983). It is often claimed that they perform on the Def Leppard single &quot;Rocket&quot;, but this is a misattribution. They have influenced artists such as Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow, and inspired Thomas Brooman to organize the WOMAD festival in 1982, which shaped the burgeoning world music genre.

The Drummers were featured in Werner Herzog&#x27;s film &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, as the &quot;drumming of the bushmen&quot;.

<text>Dennis George Wyldbore Hewitt VC (18 December 1897 – 31 July 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. He was awarded during an action at Pilckem Ridge at the Battle of Passchendaele.

==Biography==

Hewitt was the son of Elizabeth Mary née Rampini (1871–1959) and Hon. George Wyldbore Hewitt (1858–1942) – himself a son of James Hewitt, 4th Viscount Lifford. He was born in Mayfair, London and educated at Winchester College. He was 19 years old, and a Second Lieutenant in the 14th Battalion, The Hampshire Regiment (later The Royal Hampshire Regiment), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 31 July 1917 north-east of Ypres, Belgium, at Pilckem Ridge, when his first objective had been captured, Second Lieutenant Hewitt reorganised his company and moved forward. Whilst waiting for the barrage to lift, he was hit by a piece of shell which exploded the signal lights in his haversack and set fire to his equipment and clothes. He extinguished the flames and then, despite his wound and severe pain, he led forward the remnants of the company under a very heavy machine-gun fire and captured and consolidated his objective. He was subsequently killed by a sniper while inspecting the consolidation and encouraging his men.
He has no known grave and is commemorated on the Menin Gate.

<text>Robert Hawthorne VC (12 July 1823 – 2 February 1879) born in Maghera, County Londonderry was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
He was approximately 35 years old, and a Bugler in the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (later the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry), British Army during the Indian Mutiny. On 14 September 1857 he was in a column tasked with forcing an entry into Delhi through the Kashmiri Gate on its northern wall. This had first to be blown up. Hawthorne was awarded the VC on the following commendation:

Bugler Hawthorne, who accompanied the explosion party, not only performed the dangerous duty on which he was employed, but previously attached himself to Lieutenant Salkeld, of the Engineers, when dangerously wounded, bound up his wounds under a heavy musketry fire, and had him removed without further injury&quot;. (General Order of Major-General Sir Archdale Wilson, Bart., K.C.B., dated Head Quarters, Delhi City, 21 September 1857.)

==Death==
He died in Manchester, Lancashire on 2 February 1879. He is buried in Ardwick Cemetery. His grave is unmarked since headstones in this cemetery were removed in the 1950s.

==Further information==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, Winchester, Hampshire, England.
