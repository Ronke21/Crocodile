<text>A staging area (otherwise staging base, staging facility, staging ground, staging point, or staging post) is a location in which organisms, people, vehicles, equipment, or material are assembled before use. It may refer to:

* In aviation, a designated area where equipment can be staged prior to the arrival or departure of an aircraft.
* In construction, a designated area in which vehicles, supplies, and construction equipment are positioned for access and use to a construction site.
* In ecology, the resting and feeding places of migratory birds.
* In entertainment, places designated for setting up parades and other elaborate presentations.
* In real estate, the use of furniture to stage an area of one&#x27;s home to prepare it for sale.
* In media, designated places for news conferences placed near locations of high media interest.
* In space exploration, an area where final assembly is done on space vehicles before they are moved out to their launch pad.
* In data management, an intermediate storage area between the sources of information and the data warehouse (DW) or data mart (DM). It is usually of temporary nature, and its contents can be erased after the DW/DM has been loaded successfully (see data staging).
* In software development, an environment for testing that exactly resembles a production environment. It seeks to mirror an actual production environment as closely as possible and may connect to other production services and data, such as databases.

In military usage, a &quot;staging area&quot; is a place where troops or equipment in transit are assembled or processed. The US Department of Defense uses these definitions:
Often and historically, this military staging area has been termed a &quot;point d&#x27;appui&quot;, which is often on high ground and sometimes coincident with a significant prehistoric monument, as in the case of Catto Long Barrow in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Unlike normal bases, the facilities of a staging area are temporary, mainly because for a certain time it will hold much more troops and materiel than would be reasonable in peacetime.

Militaries use staging areas to deploy military units, aircraft, and warships and materiel ahead of an attack or invasion. In former times, this used to be generally the border area of one&#x27;s own country, but in recent wars (Gulf War, Kosovo War, Iraq War), it may also be the border area of another unrelated country granting access.

<text>William Alexander Gerhardie OBE FRSL (21 November 1895 – 15 July 1977) was an Anglo-Russian novelist and playwright. His first novel, &quot;Futility&quot; (1922), drew on his experiences of fighting the Bolsheviks in pre-revolutionary Russia.
==Life and career==
Gerhardie (or Gerhardi – he added the &quot;e&quot; in later years) was born at St Petersburg, Russia, the fifth of six children of Charles Alfred Gerhardi (1864–1925), a British expatriate industrialist, and his wife Clara Annie (1869–1948), daughter of John Wadsworth. He was educated at the Sankt Annenschule and Deutsche Reformierte Kirchenschule in St Petersburg, before completing his education in England at Worcester College, Oxford.

In 1915, during the First World War he enlisted in the Royal Scots Greys and trained in England while applying for a commission as an officer. After commissioning in 1916 he was posted to the staff of the British Military Attaché at Petrograd (as his birth city was then renamed) until 1918. During that period he witnessed the development of the 1917 Revolution which ruined his father who escaped Russia to exile in England having been allowed out through being identified with the (already dead) British socialist Keir Hardie.

During the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War following the revolution he was attached to the 3rd Battalion of the Scots Guards and served on the British Military Mission to the White Russian forces in Siberia. He was demobilised with the rank of captain in 1920, having been mentioned in despatches, appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and awarded the Imperial Russian Order of St Stanislaus and the Czechoslovak War Cross.

Gerhardie was one of the most critically acclaimed English novelists of the 1920s (Evelyn Waugh told him, &quot;I have talent, but you have genius.&quot;) H. G. Wells also championed his work. His first novel, &quot;Futility&quot;, was written while he was at Oxford University and drew on his experiences in Russia fighting (or attempting to fight) the Bolsheviks, along with his childhood experiences visiting pre-revolutionary Russia. Some say that it was the first work in English to explore fully the theme of &quot;waiting&quot;, later made famous by Samuel Beckett in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, but it is probably more apt to recognize a common comic nihilism between those two figures. His next novel, &quot;The Polyglots&quot;, is probably his masterpiece (although some argue for &quot;Doom&quot;). Again it deals with Russia (Gerhardie was strongly influenced by the tragi-comic style of Russian writers such as Anton Chekhov, about whom he wrote a study while in college).

He collaborated with Hugh Kingsmill on the biography &quot;The Casanova Fable&quot;, his friendship with Kingsmill being both a source of conflict over women and a great intellectual stimulus.

In the Second World War, Gerhardie served in the Officers Emergency Reserve and from 1942 to 1945 he worked with the BBC in its European Division, where he was first editor of the &quot;English by Radio&quot; language programme.

After that war Gerhardie&#x27;s star waned, and he became unfashionable. Although he continued to write, he published no new work after 1939. After a period of poverty-stricken oblivion, he lived to see two &quot;definitive collected works&quot; published by Macdonald in 1947–1949, revised in 1970–1974 with prefaces by Michael Holroyd who consistently championed his work. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975. After his death, an idiosyncratic study of world history between 1890 and 1940 was discovered among his papers, which was edited by Holroyd and Robert Skidelsky and published as &quot;God&#x27;s Fifth Column&quot;. More recently, both Prion and New Directions Press have been reissuing his works.

Gerhardie lived the last 37 years of his life in the West End of London in increasing seclusion. He died at the Middlesex Hospital in June 1977 aged 81. After cremation his ashes were scattered in Regent&#x27;s Park, at a gathering that included the writers Olivia Manning and J. G. Farrell.

Asked how to say his name, he told the &quot;Literary Digest&quot; it was &quot;pronounced &quot;jer&quot; (as &quot;Ger&quot; in &quot;Gerald&quot;) &quot;hardy&quot;, with the accent on the &quot;a&quot;: &quot;jer-har&#x27;dy&quot;. This is the way I and my relatives pronounce it, though I am told it is incorrect. Philologists are of the opinion that it should be pronounced with the &quot;g&quot; as in &quot;Gertrude&quot;. I believe they are right. I, however, cling to the family habit of mispronouncing it. But I do so without obstinacy. If the world made it worth my while I would side with the multitude.&quot;

The contemporary British novelist William Boyd has identified Gerhardie, along with Cyril Connolly, as key inspirations for the central character (the writer Logan Mountstuart) in his 2002 novel &quot;Any Human Heart&quot;. A television adaptation was released in the UK in 2010, and in the US in 2011.

<doc id="1204559" wikidata="Q2900848" url="?curid=1204559" title="Jewish Voice for Peace">
<text>Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP; ) is an American Jewish anti-Zionist and left-wing advocacy organization. It is critical of Israel&#x27;s occupation of the Palestinian territories, and supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.

The group was formed in 1996 and as of 2024 had grown to 23,000 members. Its chapters at Columbia and George Washington universities were suspended in 2024.

==History==
JVP was formed in 1996 by Julie Iny, Rachel Eisner and Julia Caplan, undergraduate students at UC Berkeley.

In 2011, the group claimed to have 600 dues-paying members, which had risen to 9,000 by 2015 and more than 23,000 by 2024.

==Funding==
Jewish Voice for Peace received significant donations from philanthropic organizations affiliated with George Soros, the Kaphan Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Fund. According to NBC News, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund awarded JVP &quot;close to a half-million dollars&quot; over a period of five years. In January 2025, JVP was ordered to pay a penalty of $677,634 to the US government for stating in their application to receive a loan under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) in 2020 that they were not &quot;primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities&quot; und not &quot;organized for research&quot; on public policy after a new restriction was added disqualifying advocacy groups and think tanks from eligibility for the loan.

==Views==
Many of JVP&#x27;s members consider the views of dovish liberal Jewish groups like J Street to be inadequate. Its views are characterised as left-wing, sometimes as far-left, and one of the more professionalized groups of the pro-Palestinian left-wing. According to its political director, identification as a Zionist and a progressive is impossible. In contrast with Palestinian-led organizations such as Within Our Lifetime, JVP seeks to work within the Democratic Party to shift the party&#x27;s position to the left on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. JVP has been described by Dov Waxman as further to the left than J Street or IfNotNow.

JVP criticizes what it describes as the &quot;severe human-rights violations that Israel engages in every day&quot;.

===Zionism===
JVP endorsed the Palestinian right of return in 2015, but did not offer details about how Israel would remain a Jewish homeland. In 2019, JVP declared itself anti-Zionist, arguing that contemporary Zionism had become a settler-colonial movement, and Israel had become an apartheid state. The organization views Zionism as an Ashkenazi-led movement with its roots in Europe, created a &quot;racist hierarchy&quot; that erased the history of Jewish communities in the Arab world, North Africa, and East Africa.

It supports an independent state for the Palestinians.

===Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions===
On February 20, 2015, JVP endorsed the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement after previously supporting selective divestment from companies operating in Israeli-occupied territories. stating &quot;JVP rejects the assertion that BDS is inherently anti-Semitic, and we encourage discussion both within our own community and outside of it of the growing BDS movement.&quot; JVP justifies its support for the movement by arguing that BDS provides a vehicle allowing individuals all over the world in the Jewish diaspora to bring about real change by threatening in their consumer choices to lower the profits of any business that by their activities reinforces Israel&#x27;s occupation of the Palestinian territories. Gal Beckerman of &quot;The Forward&quot; wrote that it &quot;is a group that has demonstrated a guerilla-like savvy in staging actions that get its message out to a broader national audience. In its use of BDS, for example, JVP has staked out a position distinct from those who target any and all entities related to Israel, which for many Jews implies a rejection of Israel&#x27;s very legitimacy. JVP instead targets only entities involved in one way or another with Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank.&quot; JVP&#x27;s executive director Rebecca Vilkomerson stated: &quot;We do feel connected to the global BDS movement. We consider ourselves a part of it.&quot;

===Israel–Hamas war===
JVP attributed the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel to &quot;Israeli apartheid and occupation — and United States complicity in that oppression.&quot; JVP said &quot;Inevitably, oppressed people everywhere will seek — and gain — their freedom.&quot; JVP called for the U.S. government to &quot;immediately take steps to withdraw military funding to Israel and to hold the Israeli government accountable for its gross violations of human rights and war crimes against Palestinians.&quot; Following the attack, the organization &quot;liked&quot; a post on social media which described the conflict as &quot;the latest unprecedented wave of resistance&quot; by Palestinians. When questioned by &quot;The Forward&quot;, the organization removed its like from the post in question. JVP used language urging lawmakers to examine the &quot;root cause&quot; of Hamas&#x27;s attack, which they believe is Israel. &quot;The Forward&quot; wrote that this was a way for JVP &quot;to acknowledge how objectionable most observers found the attacks on civilians while keeping their advocacy focused on pressuring the Israeli government to make concessions.&quot;

Jewish Voice for Peace, along with IfNotNow, led an October 16, 2023, rally in Washington, D.C. which called for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war and for United States President Joe Biden to support a ceasefire. Among the speakers was actor Wallace Shawn. On October 27, protestors organized by Jewish Voice for Peace occupied Grand Central Terminal in New York City, calling for a ceasefire and wearing t-shirts saying &quot;Not in our name&quot;. On November 6, about 500 members of Jewish Voice for Peace–New York City took part in a sit-in at the Statue of Liberty to demand a ceasefire. Photographer Nan Goldin addressed the demonstration, saying, &quot;As long as the people of Gaza are screaming, we need to yell louder, no matter who attempts to silence us.&quot;

Since November 2023, JVP&#x27;s chapter at Columbia University has been under suspension. The university stated that both the JVP chapter and Students for Justice in Palestine had breached university policies, engaging in &quot;threatening rhetoric and intimidation&quot;, leading to the suspension of the clubs.

In November 2023, the Anti-Defamation League classified anti-war protest events led by Jewish groups including Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow as &quot;anti-Israel&quot;, adding the protests to a database documenting rising antisemitism in the US. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt labelled the Jewish organizations &quot;hate groups&quot; and equated anti-Zionism with antisemitism. This led to criticism of ADL, including from its own staff, one of whom quit in protest, stating: &quot;Those were Jewish people who we [as the ADL] were defaming, so that felt extremely, extremely confusing, and frustrating to me. And it makes it harder to talk about that when any criticism of Israel, or anyone who criticizes Israel, just becomes a terrorist.&quot;

In August 2024, it was reported that George Washington University had suspended its JVP chapter along with other pro-Palestinian student groups. This suspension followed the projection of messages such as &quot;Glory to our martyrs&quot; and &quot;Free Palestine from the river to the sea&quot; on campus buildings by pro-Palestinian students in the fall of 2023. JVP had expressed support for the messages displayed during these protests. 

After the IDF had killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon in September 2024, Instagram removed the JVP&#x27;s posts for violating its guidelines by sharing posts in support of Nasrallah.

==Activities==

During 2004 and 2005, JVP protested Caterpillar Inc. for selling bulldozers to Israel, and said that Israel&#x27;s use of the D9 armoured bulldozers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a violation of human rights and Caterpillar&#x27;s business code of conduct. Along with four Christian groups, JVP introduced a shareholder resolution calling on Caterpillar to re-examine its sales of bulldozers to Israel. The resolution was rejected by 97 percent of the votes at the Caterpillar 2005 shareholders&#x27; meeting. JVP continued to introduce shareholder resolutions at Caterpillar shareholder meetings every year since 2005. In 2010 the resolution received 20% of the vote.

In June 2010, JVP launched a divestment campaign against the pension fund TIAA-CREF for investing in Caterpillar, Elbit, Veolia, Motorola, and Northrop Grumman.

In September 2010, Israeli artists came to JVP asking for US support to an artistic boycott of the theater in the city of Ariel, in the Israeli-occupied territories. JVP drafted a statement that was signed by over 150 theater and film professionals. On the significance of the action, JVP said that it &quot;was the first time such mainstream figures had drawn a line around normalizing settlements which are illegal according to international law, and which constitute one of the main impediments to a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians&quot;.

In June 2014, when the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) voted to divest its stock in Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola Solutions to protest &quot;the companies&#x27; profiting from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and pressure Israel to withdraw&quot;, JVP members attended the church&#x27;s convention and supported the divestment measure. Rabbi Alissa Wise, a JVP co-director of organizing, told the Presbyterians that to her, divestment &quot;helps Palestinians build their power. So that Israel is convinced, not by force, but by global consensus that something has to change.&quot;

===Demonstrations===

In 2006, JVP helped organize a demonstration outside a meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Sacramento, California. The stated purpose of the protest was to argue that AIPAC does not represent the views of all American Jews regarding Israel. As part of a coalition of over 100 organizations, JVP participated in the 2011 Move Over AIPAC conference. 

On February 25, 2007, JVP was one of twelve groups that sponsored a demonstration in Teaneck, New Jersey, against the sale of homes in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The organizations said that in the past, such homes were &quot;sold exclusively to Jewish people&quot; and that Palestinians were not allowed to buy them &quot;because of their religion and their ethnicity&quot;. The groups said that the home sale, which took place at Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, might violate international law and New Jersey laws against discriminatory sales practices.

The JVP position on the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict was that Israel&#x27;s actions were &quot;an opportunistic agenda for short-term political gain at an immense cost in Palestinian lives&quot; which are &quot;illegal and immoral and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms&quot;. JVP joined marches and demonstrations condemning Israel in many cities, including Racine, Wisconsin, and Seattle.

The Young Jewish Declaration is a project created by young JVP leaders. &quot;Young Jewish and Proud&quot; debuted at the 2010 Jewish General Assembly when five of its members disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s speech.

In 2020, JVP, under moderation by leader Rabbi Alissa Wise, hosted a virtual panel on antisemitism featuring Marc Lamont Hill, Barbara Ransby, Peter Beinart and Rashida Tlaib as speakers. They spoke against antisemitism being used to label advocacy in support of Palestine, while additionally attributing the right as being the largest source of antisemitism, referencing the 2019 Poway synagogue shooting as an example.

=== Publication ===
In 2004, JVP published a collection of essays entitled &quot;Reframing Anti-Semitism: Alternative Jewish Perspectives&quot;. Among the topics it discussed were antisemitism and stereotypes of Jews in modern America. It argued that the Jewish left and critics of Israeli policy had ceded the fight against antisemitism to the Jewish right and that critics of Israel or Israeli policies should not be accused of antisemitism.

==Reception==
Opponents of Jewish Voice for Peace argue that the organization amplifies a view that is often seen as fringe within the American Jewish community, creating greater tolerance for views and statements considered offensive by Zionists. The ADL, a vocal longtime critic of the organization, has argued that JVP unfairly places the onus of resolving the conflict on Israel. JVP has at times been denied participation or membership in broader Jewish community events or spaces. While some Jewish leaders concede that the community is too quick to censor criticism of Israel, even the Jewish state&#x27;s critics among the community are reluctant to welcome JVP into the fold. JVP has been criticized for partnering with groups including Electronic Intifada, Al-Awda, and the Movement for Black Lives, all of which have characterized Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid and accused the state of genocide. 

JVP has become the bête noire of the organized Jewish community in the United States, which has largely excluded the organization. Others in the Jewish community have argued that JVP has been unfairly shut out. According to political scientist Dov Waxman, the anger which JVP&#x27;s actions and positions arouse in many other American Jewish groups is just one index of a broader polarizing controversy within the Jewish American community at large, whose leaders had hitherto managed to shut out internal disagreements from the public purview. Since the 2010s, there has been a shift toward greater tolerance for JVP within the community. Some left-wing Jews have praised the organization for giving an outlet to younger Jews who are more critical toward Israel.

In September 2013, the Presbyterian Peace Fellowship awarded JVP its Peaceseeker Award &quot;for their courageous work for justice and peace in Palestine and Israel,&quot; noting that the fellowship &quot;celebrates their work of nonviolence in the face of violence.&quot;

In 2017, JVP was criticized for inviting Rasmea Odeh, a former PFLP member convicted by Israeli military courts for her role in the 1969 Jerusalem supermarket bombing, as a featured speaker in its biennial conference. Odeh was subsequently deported from the United States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and losing her American citizenship.

<text>Petrus Särkilahti (a.k.a. Pietari Särkilahti, sometimes written as &quot;Petrus Saerkilahti&quot;; died 1529) was a Finnish student of Martin Luther and one of the early pioneers of teaching science in the Finnish language. He spread the idea of the religious Reformation eagerly.

In Turku, Finland, Särkilahti met Mikael Agricola, who became his student. In 1538, the first known books written entirely in Finnish were published by Agricola. Agricola therefore became called by many &quot;the father of the written Finnish language&quot;.

<text>Damnoen Saduak (, , often referred to simply as Damnoen, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in western Thailand in Ratchaburi province. The central town is known for its floating market held every day till noon on a khlong not far from the district office. 

==Geography==
Neighbouring districts are (from the east clockwise): Ban Phaeo of Samut Sakhon province; Mueang Samut Songkhram and Bang Khonthi of Samut Songkhram province; Mueang Ratchaburi, Photharam, and Bang Phae of Ratchaburi province.

The district is crossed by the Khlong Damnoen Saduak, which connects the Tha Chin with the Mae Klong Rivers.

==History==
Originally, most of the area in Damnoen Saduak was land. Local traveling was mainly by land route. 

Until during the King Mongkut&#x27;s reign (Rama IV), he ordered the Khlong Damnoen Saduak to be excavated to connect water transportation (its name literally &#x27;comfortable travel&#x27;). It took two years to complete handled by Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse. The official inauguration ceremony took place in 1868 at Bang Nok Khwaek, its origin. Khlong Damnoen Saduak is a longest straight line man-made canal in Thailand, it links two rivers to facilitate transportation and trading routes as mentioned above. It also connects to the Khlong Phasi Charoen, which leads to the Chao Phraya River in the Bangkok area. Khlong Damnoen Saduak is about long, divided into eight milestones (at present, the remaining original area of Damnoen Saduak is the area of Don Phai sub-district). 

Most of the workers were Chinese from southern China. When the canal was finished, they settled on two banks of the canal, resulting in the condition of the floating market and waterfront community as it appears today.

The occupation of Damnoen Saduak people in the past was mostly gardeners due to fertile land, they extended their new farmland to Khlong Damnoen Saduak. There were farmers working on their farms and others worked in transportation, at that time, there was no road, trading by waterways was very busy. There were many kinds of boats commuting in the canal, including large boats, medium-size boats, sampan boats, tugboats, wooden boats and others.

The originally local houses were made of wood. When a number of people moved into Damnoen Saduak areas, hence the houses are next to each other. There are pathways on both sides of the canal bridging all the houses, so it was easy to get by, creating a nature of the community. The geography of settlements facing each other along the waterways.

== Administration ==

=== Central administration ===
Damnoen Saduak is divided into 13 sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 105 administrative villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

=== Local administration ===

Damnoen Saduak is the location of Damnoen Saduak Floating Market.

Damnoen Saduak Hospital, a teaching hospital, is the district&#x27;s main hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Pop culture==
Damnoen Saduak is the setting of a Thai country song (&quot;luk thung&quot;), titled &#x27;Damnoen Jaa&#x27; (ดำเนินจ๋า, &quot;Oh Damnoen&quot;). It was sung by Suraphol Sombatcharoen in the year 1966. It can be considered as one of his signature songs, which earned him the nickname &quot;King of Luk Thung&quot;. The lyrics can be interpreted in two ways: describing the beauty of Damnoen girl, or mentioning his love for a woman named &quot;Damnoen&quot;. However, this song is said to bring great pleasure to Damnoen Saduak resident.

The origin of this song took place on March 3, 1966, when four luk thung bands joined in a music contest in Damnoen Saduak. At that time, the result of the contest was judged from a garlands (&quot;phuang malai&quot;) and applause received from the audience. The band of Suraphol Sombatcharoen, who performed as the last, then they announced the first song he wrote especially for Damnoen people. It is titled &quot;Damnoen Jaa&quot;, his band got lots of garlands from the first song. Then they continued with the second song &quot;Nueng Nai Damnoen&quot; (หนึ่งในดำเนิน, &quot;One in Damnoen&quot;), the audience poured their love to Sombatcharoen&#x27;s band ever since.

For this reason, Damnoen Saduak is called &quot;Nashville of Luk Thung&quot;.

<text>Sir William Fletcher Barrett (10 February 1844 – 26 May 1925) was an English physicist and parapsychologist.

==Life==

He was born in Jamaica where his father, William Garland Barrett, who was an amateur naturalist, Congregationalist minister and a member of the London Missionary Society, ran a station for saving African slaves. There he lived with his mother, Martha Barrett, née Fletcher, and a brother and sister. The family returned to their native England in Royston, Hertfordshire in 1848 where another sister, the social reformer Rosa Mary Barrett was born. In 1855 they moved to Manchester and Barrett was then educated at Old Trafford Grammar School.

Barrett then took chemistry and physics at the Royal College of Chemistry and then became the science master at the London International College (1867–9) before becoming assistant to John Tyndall at the Royal Institution (1863–1866). He then taught at the Royal School of Naval Architecture.

In 1873 he became Professor of Experimental Physics at the Royal College of Science for Ireland. From the early 1880s he lived with his mother, sister, and two live-in servants in a residence at Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). Barrett discovered Stalloy (see Permalloy), a silicon-iron alloy used in electrical engineering and also did a lot of work on sensitive flames and their uses in acoustic demonstrations. During his studies of metals and their properties, Barrett worked with W. Brown and R. A. Hadfield. He also discovered the shortening of nickel through magnetisation in 1882.

When Barrett developed cataracts in his later years, he also began to study biology with a series of experiments designed to locate and successfully analyze causative agents within the eyes. The result of these experiments was a machine called the entoptiscope. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1899 and was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Dublin Society. He was knighted in 1912. He married Florence Willey in 1916. He died at home, 31 Devonshire Place in London.

Barrett&#x27;s last book, &quot;Christian Science: An Examination of the Religion of Health&quot; was completed and published after his death in 1926 by his sister Rosa M. Barrett.

==Psychical research==

Barrett became interested in the paranormal in the 1860s after having an experience with mesmerism. Barrett believed that he had been witness to thought transference and by the 1870s he was investigating poltergeists. In September 1876 Barrett published a paper outlining the result of these investigations and by 1881 he had published preliminary accounts of his additional experiments with thought transference in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. The publication caused controversy and in the wake of this Barrett decided to found a society of like-minded individuals to help further his research. Barrett held conference between 5–6 January 1882 in London. In February the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was formed.

Barrett was a Christian and spiritualist member of the SPR. Although he had founded the society, Barrett was only truly active for a year, and in 1884 founded the American Society for Psychical Research. He became president of the society in 1904 and continued to submit articles to their journal. From 1908–14 Barrett was active in the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research, a group which attracted many important members including Sir John Pentland Mahaffy, T.W. Rolleston, Sir Archibald Geikie, and Lady Augusta Gregory.

In the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by Barrett and other members of the SPR who believed them to have genuine psychic ability, however, the sisters later confessed to fraud by describing their method of signal codes that they had utilized. Barrett and the other members of the SPR such as Edmund Gurney and Frederic W. H. Myers had been easily duped.

As a believer in telepathy, Barrett denounced the muscle reading of Stuart Cumberland and other magicians as &quot;pseudo&quot; thought readers.

Barrett helped to publish Frederick Bligh Bond&#x27;s book &quot;Gate of Remembrance&quot; (1918) which was based on alleged psychical excavations at Glastonbury Abbey. Barrett endorsed the claims of the book and testified to Bond&#x27;s sincerity. However, professional archaeologists and skeptics have found Bond&#x27;s claims dubious.

In 1919, Barrett wrote the introduction to medium Hester Dowden&#x27;s book &quot;Voices from the Void&quot;.

==Dowsing==

Barrett held a special interest in divining rods and in 1897 and 1900 he published two articles on the subject in Proceedings of the SPR. He co-authored the book &quot;The Divining-Rod&quot; (1926), with Theodore Besterman.

Barrett rejected any physical theory for dowsing such as radiation. He concluded that the ideomotor response was responsible for the movement of the rod but in some cases the dowser&#x27;s unconscious could pick up information by clairvoyance.

==Reception==

Barrett has drawn criticism from researchers and skeptics as being overly credulous for endorsing spiritualist mediums and not detecting trickery that occurred in the séance room. For example, author Ronald Pearsall wrote that Barrett was duped into believing spiritualism by mediumship trickery.

Skeptic Edward Clodd criticized Barrett as being an incompetent researcher to detect fraud and claimed his spiritualist beliefs were based on magical thinking and primitive superstition. Another skeptic Joseph McCabe wrote that Barrett &quot;talks nonsense of which he ought to be ashamed&quot; as he had poor understanding of conjuring tricks and failed to detect the fraud of the medium Kathleen Goligher.

Psychical researcher Helen de G. Verrall gave Barrett&#x27;s book &quot;Psychical Research&quot; a positive review describing it as a &quot;clear, careful account of some of main achievements of psychical research by one who has himself taken part in these achievements and speaks to a large extent from personal knowledge and observation.&quot; However, in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; the book was criticized for ignoring critical work on the subject and being &quot;a negative assault on scientific method generally&quot;.

<text>The Bandiagara Escarpment (, ) is a sandstone cliff in the Dogon country of Mali. It rises about above the lower sandy flats to the south, and has a length of approximately .

The area of the escarpment is inhabited today by the Dogon people. Before the Dogon, the escarpment was inhabited by the Tellem and Toloy peoples. Many structures remain from the Tellem. The Bandiagara Escarpment was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1989.

The Cliffs of Bandiagara are a sandstone chain ranging from south to northeast over and extending to the Grandamia massif. The end of the massif is marked by the Hombori Tondo, Mali&#x27;s highest peak at . Because of its archaeological, ethnological and geological characteristics, the entire site is a point of interest.

==History==

The cave-dwelling Tellem, an ethnic group later pushed out by the arrival of the Dogons, used to live in the slopes of the cliff. The Tellem legacy is evident in the caves they carved into the cliffs so that they could bury their dead high up, far from the frequent flash floods of the area.

Dozens of villages are located along the cliff, such as Kani Bonzon. It was near this village that the Dogons arrived in the 14th century, and from there they spread over the plateau, the escarpment and the plains of the Seno-Gondo.

According to local oral history, the Dogon were relatively undisturbed by French colonial powers due to natural tunnels weaving through the Bandiagara Escarpment. Only the Dogon knew of the tunnels, and were able to use them to ambush and repel aggressors.

==The Bandiagara Escarpment today==

Today, local guides escort tourist groups along the escarpment to visit Dogon villages. A series of trails runs along the cliffs, and hostels in each village provide food and lodging. The host villages receive income from the hostels and the tourist tax. Large increases in tourism to the area are expected, as a new highway is constructed, putting pressure on local, traditional cultures. In addition, &quot;The Independent&quot; reports that looting of ancient artifacts is widespread in the area, which is poorly policed.

To call attention to the issue of uncontrolled tourist visitation, the World Monuments Fund included the Bandiagara Escarpment in the 2004 World Monuments Watch. In 2005, WMF provided a grant from American Express to the Mission Culturelle de Bandiagara for the development of a management plan. Beyond the protection of traditional buildings, the management plan calls for the regulation of new construction through the establishment of strict building guidelines, such as those that govern new development in historic districts around the world.

After the 2012 war in Mali, central areas of the country, including the Dogon Plateau and Bandiagara Escarpment, have become increasingly dangerous. Terrorist groups operate in the area, and violence between local ethnicities occurs on a daily basis.

As of 2018, it is extremely inadvisable to travel to this area for tourism, and Malian security forces have been known to turn back those who attempt to do so. In March 2018, an armed group attacked a hotel frequented by UN staff in the town of Bandiagara, killing several people.

<text>Mowni was the pen name of Tamil fiction writer S. Mani Iyer (1907–1985). Born at Semmangudi, Mowni, was one of the most significant writers of short stories in the first wave of the Tamil Renaissance. He received his high school education in Kumbakonam and lived there for fourteen years after marrying. Then he moved to Chidambaram permanently to look after his family properties. He initially had 5 children, 4 boys and a girl. Two of his sons died when they were very young. One other son passed on due to an accident. His remaining son lives in the USA. His daughter lives near Kumbakonam.

Mowni had a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Mathematics, but he did not take up any job in the field. He was very fond of European classical music and he also had very strong exposure to Western literature, and showed deep interest in Indian philosophy. Mowni wrote 24 short stories from around 1934, some of which have been translated into English. Mowni&#x27;s stories are based on the uncertainties of human life, relationships and their manifestations. His pen name and the titles of his stories were given to him by his mentor. His stories came out in Tamil magazines such as &quot;Theni.&quot; He was fondly called by pudhumaipithan ( contemporary writer of his age)as &quot;sirukathaiyin thirumular.&quot; Mowni died in Chidambaram on June 6, 1985.

R. Parthasarathy, Associate Professor of English and Asian Studies at Skidmore College, in a journal article on Tamil Literature, writes that Mowni explored the psychological qualities of character and situation. In the words of Subramanyam, Mowni &quot;put the Tamil language to uses to which it had never been exposed and, in the process, became difficult, though not obscure.&quot;

<doc id="1204579" wikidata="Q984039" url="?curid=1204579" title="Doneraile">
<text>Doneraile (), historically Dunnerail, is a town in County Cork, Ireland. It is on the R581 regional road east of the N20 road, which runs from Limerick to Cork. It is about north of Mallow town. It is on the River Awbeg, a branch of the Blackwater. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name. Doneraile is part of the Cork East Dáil constituency.

== Name ==
The town sits on the northern slope of Knockacur hill, which rises by a gentle slope from the Awbeg river and gradually ascends to a rocky prominence. However, it was not this rocky prominence but one near the graveyard of Oldcourt which together with an ancient fort built thereon, gave the town its name, Doneraile, i.e. &quot;Dún ar Aill&quot;, meaning &quot;the fort on the cliff&quot;.

In a land transfer record from 1636, covering an agreement between members of the Synan and St. Ledger families, the land was referred to as &quot;Downerayle... now in the actual and real possession of the said Wm. St. Leger&quot;.

== History ==

The horse race known as the steeplechase originated in 1752 as a result of a race between the church steeples of the town and neighbouring Buttevant town.

There are only a few reported cases of women becoming Freemasons but one exception occurred in 18th century Doneraile. Elizabeth Aldworth, was reported to have surreptitiously viewed the proceedings of a Lodge meeting held at Doneraile Court — the private house of her father, Arthur St Leger, 1st Viscount Doneraile. Upon discovering the breach of their secrecy, the Lodge resolved to admit and obligate her, and thereafter she proudly appeared in public in Masonic clothing.

In 1829, the shooting of a local doctor, John Norcott, led to rumours of a widespread conspiracy to murder local landlords. On the word of an informer, twenty-one local men were arrested and charged with the alleged crime. Most were fortunate enough to be defended by Daniel O&#x27;Connell, who secured the acquittal of the majority of them. The event came to known as the Doneraile conspiracy.

Doneraile is also where Ireland&#x27;s first successful agricultural co-operative and creamery was established in 1889 by Horace Plunkett.

During the early part of May 1853, a countryman ploughing in the neighbourhood turned up a large quantity of silver coins, amounting to more than forty-six ounces in weight, which were purchased by a silversmith in Cork. They consisted of English shillings and sixpences of Elizabeth, with a few groats, threepences and half-groats of the same queen; also a few groats of her predecessors, Mary, and Philip and Mary both having the bust of Mary; English shillings and sixpences of James 1, upon the union with Scotland and exclusively of the rose, thistle, and fleur-de-lis mint marks; with a large number of the quarter-dollars and smaller money of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. Nearly all the coins were in the finest state of preservation, and appeared to have been but little used or in circulation.

Doneraile also achieved note in 1954 when a British journalist, Honor Tracy, condemned the local priest Canon Maurice O&#x27;Connell for spending the then exorbitant amount of £9000 on his parochial house while there was so much poverty in the village. Following &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″ apology to O&#x27;Connell, Tracy sued it and was awarded £3000 in compensation. In response some 3000 of Doneraile&#x27;s parishioners marched in the village in support of Canon O&#x27;Connell.

== Education ==
Canon Sheehan Primary School is the only primary school located in Doneraile. The school was established in 2016 after the amalgamation of two former primary schools in Doneraile; Presentation Primary School and St Joseph&#x27;s CBS Primary School.

Nagle Rice Secondary School is the only secondary school in Doneraile, which has been opened since 24 September 1993 and is co-educational.

== Twinning agreements ==
Doneraile is twinned with Ramapo, New York.

==Notable people==

* Elizabeth Aldworth (1690s–1770s), &quot;The Lady Freemason&quot;
* Thomas Croke (1824–1902), Archbishop of Cashel and Emly in Ireland and Land League activist was parish priest in Doneraile
* Donncha Ó Dúlaing (1933–2021), broadcaster
* John B. Keane (1928–2002), Kerry-born writer, worked in Doneraile during the 1950s as an assistant for the local antiques dealer and chemist, and occasionally attending the petrol pumps outside.
* Patrick Augustine Sheehan (1852–1913), priest, author and political activist

<doc id="1204580" wikidata="Q1142501" url="?curid=1204580" title="Wood auger">
<text>An auger is a device to drill wood or other materials, consisting of a rotating metal shaft with a blade at the end that scrapes or cuts the wood.

==Types==

The classical design has a helical screw blade winding around the bottom end of the shaft. The lower edge of the blade is sharpened and scrapes the wood; the rest of the blade lifts the chips out of the way. It is powered with two hands, by a T-shaped handle attached to the top of the shaft.

More modern versions have elaborated auger bits with multiple blades in various positions. Modern versions also have different means to drive the shaft, resulting in various tools such as braces, wheel drills (the &quot;eggbeater&quot; drill), and power drills.

<text>The Social Security Amendments of 1965, , was legislation in the United States whose most important provisions resulted in creation of two programs: Medicare and Medicaid. The legislation initially provided federal health insurance for the elderly (over 65) and for financially challenged families.

==History==
In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt included social insurance for sickness in the platform of his Progressive Party. Around 1915 the group American Association for Labor Legislation attempted to introduce a medical insurance bill to some state legislatures. The attempts were not successful, and as a result, controversy about national insurance came about. National groups supporting the idea of government health insurance included the AFL–CIO, the American Nurses Association, National Association of Social Workers, and the Socialist Party USA. The most prominent opponent of national medical insurance was the American Medical Association (AMA); others included the American Hospital Association, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the Life Insurance Association of People.

The concept of national health insurance began in the early 20th century in the United States and then came to prominence during the Truman administration following World War II. Between 1958 and 1964, controversy grew and a bill was drafted. The signing of the act, as part of Johnson&#x27;s Great Society, began an era with a greater emphasis on public health issues. Medicare and Medicaid became the country&#x27;s first public health insurance programs. The legislation was vigorously opposed by the American Medical Association until it had been enacted, but the AMA obtained concessions and later co-operated in its implementation.

Many politicians were involved in drafting the final bill that was introduced to the United States Congress in March 1965. On July 30, 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill into law.

===Previous administrations===
In 1935, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, medical benefits were left out of the bill. The committee that Roosevelt appointed to study issues related to Social Security wanted to include health insurance in the bill. However, the committee was concerned that amending the bill to include health insurance would kill the entire bill. Harry Truman took on the idea of national medical care and tried to integrate it into his Fair Deal program. Truman&#x27;s attempts were also unsuccessful, but during his presidency, the fight for national medical care became specific to the aged population.

Once the targeted age was decided, a lengthy debate began over presenting a coherent medical care bill to Congress. The Conservative Coalition dominated the House Ways and Means Committee, which complicated attempts to pass social health programs. Wilbur Mills (D-AR), the chair of the committee, later played a role in creating the health care program that was integrated into the Social Security Act.

In 1960, the Kerr–Mills Act created the Medical Assistance for the Aged (MAA), a program that gave states the power to decide which patients needed financial assistance. The federal government would provide matching funds to the states for the program. Some states did not participate in or abide by the Act. Another preliminary bill, the King–Anderson Bill, was introduced in 1962. Under it, some hospital and nursing home costs for patients 65 and older would have been covered. Although the bill was defeated in committee, the vote was narrow (12–11), signaling a shift in attitudes.

===Johnson administration===
With the election of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Democrats controlled both the presidency and the Congress, claiming a 2:1 ratio to Republicans in the House and 32 more seats in the Senate. The Democrats in the House Ways and Means Committee shifted away from Southern Democrats, making the committee more sympathetic towards health insurance reform.

Those who had worked on the King-Anderson Bill drafted a new bill providing coverage of the aged, limited hospitalization and nursing home insurance benefits, and Social Security financing. Wilbur Cohen, Assistant Secretary for Legislation of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (and later Secretary), pushed the Medicare bill. Cohen convinced Johnson to give the bill high priority, and Johnson declared its importance to his Great Society program. The bill was introduced as companion bills, H.R. 1 and S. 1, with the numbers being the first bills introduced in each house of a new Congress.

=== House of Representatives ===
The groups previously opposed to the legislation switched their focus from opposing the bill to creating new versions of it. As a result, three forms of the bill emerged: John Byrnes&#x27;s, the American Medical Association&#x27;s, and the administration&#x27;s bill (known as Medicare). Byrnes was a Republican committee member who proposed for doctors&#x27; services and drugs to be financed; participation in coverage would be voluntary for the aged. An elderly patient who needed the help would have financing &quot;scaled to the amounts of the participant&#x27;s Social Security cash benefits,&quot; and the financing would come from the government&#x27;s revenues. The AMA proposed Eldercare, which provided government financing for physician&#x27;s services, surgical charges, drugs, nursing home costs, X-ray and lab services. When brought back to the Ways and Means committee, three bills were presented: Byrnes&#x27;s, Eldercare, and Medicare.

When deliberations began in 1965, both AMA members and their suggestions were rejected. Wilbur Mills, the chair of the Ways and Means committee, suggested combining Byrnes&#x27;s ideas and Medicare. His committee took on the task of drafting H.R. 6675, the bill that ultimately became law. In combining the two bills, Byrnes&#x27;s suggestion, which included lower taxes, had to be altered as higher taxes were necessary for the program&#x27;s predicted costs. The Ways and Means Committee reported favorably on the new bill to the full House of Representatives on March 29 after a straight-party committee vote of 17 to 8.

During debate on the House floor, Republicans offered a substitute bill that would have made participation fully voluntary. It was narrowly defeated 236 to 191, with 128 of 138 Republicans in favor of the substitute. H.R. 6675 was passed in the House on April 8, 1965, by a vote of 313 to 115.

=== Senate ===
The biggest threat to the passage of H.R. 6675 in the Senate came from liberal Democrats who were eager to expand coverage of the bill. As amended and passed in the Senate on July 19 by a vote of 68 to 21, H.R. 6675 would have cost approximately $800 million more than the House bill.

=== Final passage ===
The bill went to a conference committee at which Mills worked to eliminate practically all of the Senate amendments. The bill went through more than 5// amendments before being passed by majority vote in the House (307–116) on July 27 and in the Senate on July 28 (70–24).

The legislation made two amendments to the Social Security Act of 1935. Title XVIII, which became known as Medicare, includes Part A, which provides hospital insurance for the aged, and Part B, which provides supplementary medical insurance. Title XIX, which became known as Medicaid, provides for the states to finance health care for individuals who were at or close to the public assistance level with federal matching funds.

On July 30, 1965, Johnson signed the bill, making it Public Law 89–97. The signing took place in Independence, Missouri and was attended by Truman. Johnson credited Truman with &quot;planting the seeds of compassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick and serenity for the fearful.&quot; Implementation of the amendments required extensive data processing and the re-configuration of hospital policies nationwide.

== Effects ==
In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the federal government doubled the number of physicians trained in the US from 8,000 to 16,000 a year. There was a hospital building boom that moved from inpatient wards to one- and two-patient hospital rooms.

<text>The post-autistic economics movement (), or movement of students for the reform of economics teaching (), is a political movement that criticises neoclassical economics and advocates for pluralism in economics. The movement gained attention after an open letter signed by almost a thousand economics students at French universities and grandes ecoles was published in &quot;Le Monde&quot; in 2000.

==Terminology==
The French term has an older meaning than the English term &quot;autism&quot; and signifies &quot;abnormal subjectivity, acceptance of fantasy rather than reality&quot;. However, post-autistic economists also &quot;assert that neoclassical economics has the characteristics of an autistic child&quot;.

The pejorative reference to autism is considered offensive by some economists.

==Response==
The French minister of education appointed a panel headed by Jean-Paul Fitoussi to inquire into economics teaching. In 2000, the panel called for limited reform.

Articles associated with the movement were published in the &quot;Post-Autistic Economics Newsletter&quot; from September 2000. This electronic newsletter became the &quot;Post-Autistic Economics Review&quot; and, since 2008, has existed as the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Real-World Economics Review&quot;.

Several responses to the French students&#x27; open letter were also published in &quot;Le Monde&quot;. A counter-petition signed by 15 French economists was published in October 2000. Robert Solow adhered to the &quot;main thesis&quot; of the French students&#x27; petition, but criticised the &quot;opaque and almost incomprehensible&quot; debate that followed among academics. Olivier Blanchard published a response defending mainstream economics. Other notable economists, such as Steve Keen and James K. Galbraith, wrote elsewhere in support of the French students.

<text>William Hew Clark-Kennedy, (3 March 1879 – 25 October 1961) was a British-born Canadian soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Family ==
William Clark-Kennedy was born on 3 March 1879 at Dunskey House, near Portpatrick on the Scottish Rhins of Galloway. His mother was Lettice Lucy Hewitt (c. 1853–1930), a daughter of the Fourth Viscount of Lifford. His father was Captain Alexander William Maxwell Clark-Kennedy (Irish Guards) of Knockgray, Galloway (-1894).

== Victoria Cross ==
William Clark-Kennedy was 39 years old, and a lieutenant colonel commanding the 24th Battalion (Victoria Rifles of Canada), Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 27/28 August 1918 on the Fresnes-Rouvroy line, France, the brigade of which Lieutenant Colonel Clark-Kennedy&#x27;s battalion was a central unit suffered heavy casualties. At this juncture the colonel encouraged his men and led them forward, then by controlling the direction of neighbouring units and collecting stragglers he enabled the whole brigade front to advance. Next day he was severely wounded, but despite intense pain and loss of blood, he refused to be evacuated until he had gained a position from which the advance could be resumed.

Clark-Kennedy is buried at Mount Royal Cemetery, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Pine Hill Section, Reford Family Plot, Lot 258).

<text>Lance Corporal Arthur Henry Cross (13 December 1884 – 23 November 1965) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Cross was born in Shipdham, Norfolk, one of five children. He moved to London when aged 15. He was married and became a father at the age of 18.

==Military career==
Cross enlisted in the 21st Battalion First Surrey Rifles, The London Regiment on 30 May 1916. In 1917, he transferred to the Machine Gun Corps. He was 33 years old, and a lance corporal in the 40th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 25 March 1918 at Ervillers, France, Lance-Corporal Cross volunteered to make a reconnaissance of the position of two machine-guns which had been captured by the enemy. With the agreement of his sergeant he crept back alone with only a service revolver to what had been his section&#x27;s trench and was now the enemy&#x27;s. He surprised seven soldiers who responded by throwing down their rifles. He then marched them carrying the machine guns complete with the tripods and ammunition to the British lines. He then handed over the prisoners and collected teams for his guns which he brought into action immediately, annihilating a very heavy attack by the enemy.

The Victoria Cross was given for &quot;extreme gallantry, initiative and dash&quot;. In June he was awarded the Military Medal for another act of bravery.

==Legacy==
Cross received an engraved gold watch upon visiting his old village, and later a road there was named after him. 

His medal was used as a prop in the film &quot;Carrington V.C.&quot; starring David Niven.

He was buried in the family grave at Streatham Vale Cemetery, Plot E, Square 27, Grave 885, joining his second wife along with their two children.

<text>The 1907 VFL season was the eleventh season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 27 April to 21 September, comprising a 17-match home-and-away season followed by a three-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by five points in the 1907 VFL grand final; it was Carlton&#x27;s second (consecutive and overall) VFL premiership. Carlton also won its second consecutive minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 13–4 win–loss record. &#x27;s Dick Lee won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1907, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further &#x27;sectional rounds&#x27; were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other. 

Once the 17 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1907 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended &quot;&quot;Argus&quot; system&quot;.

===Grand final===

==Season notes==
*In November 1906, the VFL was a founding member of the Australasian Football Council, which served as the new national administrative body governing the sport.
*The rules concerning kick-ins were amended, such that if the full back crossed outside the goal square before kicking the ball, a ball-up would be called on the top of the goal square. Previously, the full-back was given a second opportunity to kick legally, before a free kick would be awarded.
* Due to the &quot;Special&quot; football train arriving late, the start of the Round 3 match between Fitzroy and Geelong at Brunswick Street Oval was delayed by twenty minutes.
* In round 6, St Kilda defeated Melbourne 15.18 (108) to 7.9 (51); it was the first time in the club&#x27;s 173 VFL matches to that point that St Kilda had scored 100 points or more.
* The VFL played two representative matches on Saturday 8 June, in the week between Rounds 6 and 7: on the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the VFL 25.20 (170) defeated the Ballarat Football Association 3.7 (25); and at Bendigo, the VFL 14.10 (94) defeated the Bendigo Football League 7.11 (53). The VFL also played a return match against the Ballarat Association on the Ballarat City Oval on Saturday 27 July, the week between Rounds 12 and 13; in a rain-affected game, the VFL 8.4 (52) defeated Ballarat 3.7 (25).
* In Round 8, Fitzroy kicked eleven goals without a behind against Collingwood, before three misses in the last quarter. They did not score in the second and third quarters after kicking 7.0 (42) in the first quarter.
* In Round 11, Geelong defeated St Kilda despite having ten fewer scoring shots; before this, no VFL team had won with a deficit in scoring shots greater than eight. They repeated the feat of winning with ten fewer shots against Collingwood in the last round.
* During that last match, Collingwood succumbed to Geelong despite being 38 points ahead at three quarter time; this record was not beaten until 1936.
* Owing to rough play – and, in some observers&#x27; opinions, an over-correction after no players were reported in the particularly rough round 14 match between South Melbourne and St Kilda – eight players were reported during the matches in Sectional Round 1: three by the matches&#x27; central umpires, and five (all in the Carlton vs South Melbourne match) by the club delegates. The VFL Investigation Committee took three full evenings to complete the hearings, with Friday evening&#x27;s session forced to run until almost 5am to complete it in time for Saturday&#x27;s matches. Seven of the eight reported players were suspended, most notably &#x27;s Billy Gent who was disqualified for life. The four suspensions from the Carlton vs South Melbourne match – Fred Elliott, Jim Marchbank, Bert Franks and Billy Gent – were later overturned on procedural grounds in May 1908, after it was determined that the historical VFL practice of players being reported by club delegates was not allowed under the Australasian Football Council rules which the VFL had adopted in 1907.
* The playing surface in each of the season&#x27;s semi-finals that had been played on the Melbourne Cricket Ground (South Melbourne vs Collingwood, and Carlton vs St Kilda) had been so rock hard and dusty that the two match winners demanded that the MCG be watered before the next Saturday, unless there was substantial rain. The VFL acquiesced to this request, and the ground was watered; the ensuing premiership final, which Carlton won by five points, was on significantly softer ground.
* In the 1907 pre-season, then VFA team Richmond played a practice match against VFL team Geelong at Corio Oval, in direct defiance of a VFA edict. On 22 October 1907, Richmond, who had become quite dissatisfied with the VFA, applied to join the VFL: their application was unanimously accepted at a meeting five days later, and Richmond competed for the first time in the 1908 VFL season.
* St Kilda qualified for its first VFL finals appearance.

==Awards==
* The 1907 VFL Premiership team was Carlton.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Dick Lee of Collingwood with 47 goals.
* Essendon took the &quot;wooden spoon&quot; in 1907.

<text>Cunégonde is a fictional character in Voltaire&#x27;s 1759 novel &quot;Candide&quot;. She is the title character&#x27;s aristocratic cousin and love interest.

At the beginning of the story, the protagonist Candide is chased away from his uncle&#x27;s home after he is caught kissing and fondling Cunégonde. Shortly afterwards, Cunégonde&#x27;s family is attacked by a band of marauding soldiers, and she is taken prisoner. However, Cunégonde soon becomes the mistress of two wealthy Portuguese men who decide to share her between them. Candide kills the two men and he, Cunégonde and the Old Woman (Cunégonde&#x27;s servant) flee to Buenos Aires.

There, Cunégonde becomes the mistress of the provincial governor. Since Candide is wanted for the murders of the two Portuguese men, he is forced to leave her in Buenos Aires. However, he vows to find her and marry her. Finally, near the end of the novel, Candide finds Cunégonde in Istanbul, but she has lost her beauty, and is now very irritable and unfortunately very shallow-minded. Candide reluctantly agrees to marry her.

==Name==
&quot;Cunégonde&quot; may be derived from Cunigunde of Luxembourg. However, the first part of the name may be intended as a pun, referring to the female genitalia (Latin: cunnus, French: con).

Kunigunde, Kunigunda, or Cunigunde is a European female name of German origin derived from &quot;kuni&quot; (clan, family) and &quot;gund&quot; (war). In Polish this is sometimes Kunegunda or Kinga.

==&quot;Candide&quot; (operetta)==
In the 1956 operetta &quot;Candide&quot; written by Leonard Bernstein, Cunegonde is a soprano, who sings one of the most difficult arias written for the theatre: &quot;Glitter and Be Gay&quot;. The role has been portrayed by skilled actresses such as Barbara Cook, who originated the role in 1956, Madeline Kahn, Kristin Chenoweth, June Anderson, Harolyn Blackwell, and Maureen Brennan, who received a Tony Award nomination and won the Theatre World Award for her performance in the 1974 Broadway revival.

<text>Gerriet Postma (30 October 1932 – 27 February 2009) was a Dutch painter.

Postma was born in Twijzelerheide, Friesland, the Netherlands. He was a vehement man who painted bold paintings, with explosions of paint and abstract knots of color, with a distant figurative strain running through it.

His last large-scale work comprised four panels, painted on the four main sails of the traditional and historic cargo barge &quot;Klipper Anna&quot;. The painting is two-sided and is about 270 m2 in area. The 106-year-old ship was provided by its owners, Gijs en Inge van Hesteren from Harlingen, Friesland, the Netherlands. All summer long in 2004, the painting could be seen everywhere around the Dutch Wadden Sea.

By 2009 Postma had become the best-known Frisian painter. His work is on display in galleries of Paris, Brussels and Barcelona.

Postma died in Groningen on 27 February 2009.

<doc id="1204609" wikidata="Q19486" url="?curid=1204609" title="Allen's swamp monkey">
<text>The Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey (Allenopithecus nigroviridis) is a species of Old World monkey and the only member of the genus Allenopithecus. Phylogenetically, it is a sister clade to the guenons, but differs in dentition and habits.

Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey was named after American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen.

== Range ==
Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey lives in the Congo Basin, the Republic of Congo, the west of the DRC, and Cameroon. It was recorded from Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve in the Central African Republic in 2016.

== Description ==
This monkey is a rather strongly built animal. The slight webbing of the fingers and toes point to its partially aquatic way of life. Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey can reach a full body length from 45 to 60 cm, with a roughly 50-cm-long tail. Males, weighing up to 6 kg, are substantially larger than the females (up to 3.5 kg).

== Behavior ==
Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey is a diurnal animal and regularly looks for food on the ground. It inhabits swampy, water-rich areas and can swim well, diving to avoid danger. It lives in social groups of up to 40 animals, communicating with different calls, gestures, and touches.

Its diet consists of fruits and leaves, as well as beetles and worms.

Little is known of the mating habits of this species. The females bear young, which are weaned around three months old and are mature after three to five years. Its lifespan can be as long as 23 years. Raptors, snakes, and the bonobo are the natural predators of Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey. It is also hunted for its meat.

<text>Air Bud is a 1997 sports comedy-drama film directed by Charles Martin Smith. An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film stars Kevin Zegers as a young boy who befriends a runaway Golden Retriever (portrayed by Buddy) with a unique ability to play basketball.

&quot;Air Bud&quot; received mixed reviews but was a commercial success, grossing $4 million in its opening weekend and totaling $27.8 million in its run against an estimated $3 million budget. It was followed by a direct sequel, &quot;Air Bud: Golden Receiver&quot;, in 1998, and spawned a film franchise that includes the spin-off series &quot;Air Buddies&quot;.

==Plot==
After the death of his father, Josh Framm, his mother Jackie, and his two-year-old sister Andrea have relocated to Fernfield, Washington. One day after school, Josh practices basketball by himself in a makeshift court that he sets up behind an abandoned church, where he meets an abandoned and runaway Golden Retriever who had recently escaped from his abusive owner: a alcoholic clown named Norman Snively, who had locked him in a kennel for causing trouble at a birthday party when the kennel unknowingly fell out due to Snively not securing the back. Discovering his uncanny ability to play basketball, Josh names him Buddy and takes him home. Jackie agrees to let Buddy stay until Christmas. Once the holidays arrive, Jackie allows Josh to keep Buddy as a Christmas present.

At school, Josh earns the disdain of star basketball player and team bully Larry Willingham but befriends kindhearted maintenance engineer and retired pro player Arthur Chaney. With Chaney&#x27;s encouragement, Josh earns a place on the school basketball team, the Timberwolves, despite the reservation of their competitive coach, Joe Barker. He befriends teammate Tom Stewart at his first game. Buddy escapes and shows up at school during the game. The audience loves him when he scores a basket.

Barker is fired after being caught emotionally and physically abusing Tom for his poor performance and is replaced by Chaney at Josh&#x27;s suggestion. Arthur emphasizes the need for players to work as a team instead of focusing on themselves. When Larry is subbed out due to ball-hogging and unsportsmanlike conduct, his father forces him to leave the team and join their rival. Buddy becomes the mascot of the school&#x27;s basketball team and appears in their halftime shows. The Timberwolves lose one game before qualifying for the State Finals.

Just before the championship game, Snively appears after seeing Buddy on television. Hoping to profit from Buddy&#x27;s newfound fame, he forces Jackie to hand over Buddy as he has papers proving he is the legal owner. Withdrawn and depressed, Josh discovers Snively living in a small income house and sneaks into his backyard, freeing Buddy from his chain. Snively notices him and pursues them in his dilapidated pickup truck through a park before crashing into a lake. Josh decides to protect Buddy by setting him free in the forest to find a new life.

The Timberwolves struggle at the championship game, and an injury leaves them with four players. Buddy shows up to the cheers of the crowd, and after it is discovered that there is no rule preventing a dog from playing basketball, he is added to the roster and leads the team to victory.

Despite his papers being ruined in the car wreck, Snively attempts to sue the Framm family for custody of Buddy, and Chaney suggests that Buddy choose his owner. As a fan of Chaney himself, Judge Cranfield accepts his proposal and moves the court outside to the lawn. During the calling, Buddy attacks Snively and chooses Josh. Cranfield grants custody to Josh as a ranting Snively is dragged away by the police, while Josh and the rest of the citizens rejoice and gather around Buddy to welcome him home.

<text>John Campbell Boot, 2nd Baron Trent, KBE (19 January 1889 – 8 March 1956), was a British retail businessman, the son of the Sir Jesse Boot who turned the pharmaceutical retailer &quot;Boots Company&quot; into a major national company, and Florence Boot. 

==Biography==
Boot was educated at The Leys School and Jesus College, Cambridge, and served in the First World War. In 1914 he married Margaret Pyman and had four daughters.

The 2nd Lord Trent continued his father&#x27;s expansion of the company. Like his father, he was also a philanthropist who was keenly involved with the City of Nottingham. In 1944 he was appointed President of University College, Nottingham, and, after it was granted full university status in 1948 as the University of Nottingham, became its first Chancellor.

Following Lord Trent&#x27;s retirement as Chancellor, the Boots Company endowed the Lord Trent Chair of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Lady Trent Chair of Chemical Engineering in his honour.

<text>Attributing the profession of journalist to a fictional character allows many possibilities for the author: reporters may travel extensively and face adventures (like Tintin), are among the first to have news of disasters and crimes (like Clark &quot;Superman&quot; Kent and Peter &quot;Spider-Man&quot; Parker), and are supposed to be good at establishing communication. Some journalist may also be recognized as heroes (like Ulala from &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;), and fix the mixed and negative reception of the profession from their respective fictional universe.

<text>The Chorus (, , ) is a 2004 German-French-Swiss musical drama film directed by Christophe Barratier. Co-written by Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval, it is an adaptation of the 1945 film &quot;A Cage of Nightingales&quot; (&quot;La Cage aux rossignols&quot;). The story is inspired by the origin of the boys&#x27; choir the Little Singers of Paris.

At the 77th Academy Awards, &quot;The Chorus&quot; was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song (the latter for &quot;Vois sur ton chemin&quot;, listed as &quot;Look to Your Path&quot;, composed by Bruno Coulais).

==Plot==

In 2004, Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin), a French conductor performing in the United States, is informed before a concert that his mother has died. After the performance he returns to his home in France for her funeral. An old friend named Pépinot (Didier Flamand) arrives at his door with a diary which belonged to their teacher, Clément Mathieu. They proceed to read it together.

In 1949, fifty-four years earlier, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot), a failed musician, arrives at Fond de l&#x27;Étang (&quot;Bottom of the Pond&quot;), a French boarding school for troubled boys of all ages, to work as a supervisor and teacher. At the gate, he sees a very young boy, Pépinot (Maxence Perrin), waiting for Saturday, when he says his father will pick him up. The viewers later learn that his parents were killed in the Second World War during the Nazi occupation of France, but Pépinot does not know this.

Mathieu discovers the boys being ruthlessly punished by the very strict headmaster, Rachin (François Berléand) and attempts to use humour and kindness to win them over. When a booby trap set by one of the boys, LeQuerrec, injures the school&#x27;s elderly caretaker, Maxence (Jean-Paul Bonnaire), Mathieu keeps the culprit&#x27;s identity from the headmaster, while encouraging LeQuerrec to nurse Maxence during his recovery.

On discovering the boys singing rude songs about him, Mathieu forms a plan: he will teach them to sing and form a choir as a form of discipline. He groups the boys according to their voice types, but one student, Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), refuses to sing. Mathieu catches Morhange singing to himself, discovers he has a wonderful singing voice and awards him solo parts on the condition that he behaves.

Morhange&#x27;s single mother, Violette (Marie Bunel), arrives at the school. When Mathieu goes to explain that Morhange cannot be visited because he has been locked up as a punishment, he finds himself pitying and being attracted to the boy&#x27;s beleaguered mother and instead tells her that Morhange is at the dentist. Meanwhile, a cruel, uncontrollable boy named Mondain () arrives and begins causing trouble by bullying the others, influencing others to be like him and generally being rebellious. After stealing a watch, he is locked up for two weeks.

The choir is improving rapidly with Morhange as its lead soloist; the children are happier, and the faculty less strict — even Rachin begins to loosen up, playing football with the boys and making a paper aeroplane. After Mondain is released from lock-up, he runs away and seemingly steals all the school&#x27;s money. After Mondain is captured, Rachin repeatedly slaps him, until Mondain in turn attempts to strangle Rachin. Rachin hands him over to the police, still not knowing the location of the stolen money, and disbands the choir. Mathieu begins teaching his choir &quot;underground&quot;, practising at night in their dormitory.

Mathieu continues to meet Morhange&#x27;s mother, who is unaware of his attraction to her. He plans to help her son win a scholarship to the music conservatory in Lyon. One day she blithely informs him that she has met someone: an engineer. Mathieu is dejected but expresses his feigned happiness and watches her leave in the engineer&#x27;s car.

The Countess, a sponsor of the school, finds out about the choir; they perform before her and others, and Morhange enchants the audience with his solo. Mathieu discovers that another boy, Corbin, stole the money that Mondain was accused of taking. Despite this, Rachin refuses to accept Mondain back at the school especially after Mathieu refuses to reveal who the real culprit is.

When Rachin departs to accept an award from the board after taking credit for the choir, Mathieu and Maxence suspend classes and take the boys on an outing. While they are out, Mondain returns and sets fire to the school. Mathieu is fired for breaking the rules, even though he saved the boys&#x27; lives, and Maxence is suspended. As Mathieu leaves, the boys —forbidden to say goodbye — lock themselves in their classroom, sing and throw farewell messages out of the window on paper planes. Touched, Mathieu walks away, musing about how he has failed and nobody knows of his existence.

Back in the present, the adult Morhange finishes reading the diary and recounts what happened afterwards: he won his scholarship to the conservatory, and Rachin was fired after his fellow teachers exposed his abuse towards the students. Mathieu, Pépinot relates, continued to give music lessons quietly for the rest of his life.

The final scene (in the past again) shows Mathieu waiting for his bus after being fired. As he boards it, he looks back and finds Pépinot running after him, insisting that he come too. Initially, Mathieu refuses because it is not allowed, and he leaves Pépinot behind. Suddenly, the bus stops and Mathieu gives in: the two board the bus together. Pépinot finally got his wish, for he and Mathieu left on a Saturday, and Mathieu raised him.

==Production==

===Development===

After making the short film &quot;Les Tombales&quot;, director Christophe Barratier was looking for a subject for his first feature film. He noticed that many of his ideas were linked to his childhood, and the emotions he felt between the ages of four and eight. Coming from a musical background, he also wanted to tell a story linked to music. The themes of childhood and music made him think of the film &quot;La Cage aux rossignols&quot;, which he had seen on television at a young age and which &quot;touched [him] profoundly&quot;. Barratier told his idea to Gérard Jugnot, whom he had known for quite a long time and with whom he shared a taste for old French cinema and actors such as Noël-Noël; Jugnot liked it but thought that the film would have to be set in the past, otherwise his character would be transformed into someone who &quot;teaches rapping in the suburbs&quot;. Barratier said he did not think about setting the film in the present time because &quot;Clément Mathieu [would have] other priorities, he would have nothing in common with a 1950s music teacher&quot;. Barratier then began writing the script; Jugnot said that the first version somewhat &quot;lacked roughness&quot;, and co-writer Philippe Lopes-Curval got involved. He collaborated with Barratier to strengthen the story and develop the psychology of characters such as Rachin—for whom the children are &quot;the symbol of a failed professional life&quot;—and Chabert.

===Casting===
The director was keen that the role of the young Pierre Morhange should be played by a real singer, and the search for him was tedious. While touring large French choirs to choose the one to record the film&#x27;s soundtrack, they discovered the 12-year-old Jean-Baptiste Maunier of Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc: Barratier described his voice as &quot;exceptional and very moving&quot;, and composer Bruno Coulais said it was &quot;incredible&quot;. They decided to cast him as Morhange and use the choir for the soundtrack, but that the rest of the choir would not play his classmates because the director did not want them to be professional actors. Instead, they looked for children near the filming location in Auvergne: casting director Sylvie Brocheré visited primary and secondary schools in Clermont-Ferrand, looking for children between the ages of six and 15. After over 2000 auditions, the roles were cast. Of all the children, only the Parisians Théodule Carré Cassaigne and Thomas Blumenthal had some small acting experience.

===Filming===

Principal photography took place on location at the Château de Ravel in Puy-de-Dôme. Foam and salt were used as artificial snow and green leaves were removed from the grounds, since the beginning of the movie was filmed in the summer, but set in the winter. Fog machines were also used around the castle, and walls were deliberately scorched and stripped of paint to give the surroundings a &quot;dilapidated&quot; look, since boarding schools at the time often suffered from poor funding and management. When filming his first scene in which his character Mondain tries to intimidate Clément Mathieu, Gatignol had trouble behaving menacingly towards Jugnot, who described him as &quot;too nice&quot;. For the scene in which Morhange drops ink on Mathieu&#x27;s head, gouache was used. During choir scenes, song lyrics were written on large cue cards and the classroom&#x27;s blackboard to aid actors. The children who played the choir described how their singing improved through the duration of the shoot; Nicolas Porte, the choirmaster of Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc, said that this &quot;means that the story we tell is credible&quot;. Bruno Coulais, the composer of the film&#x27;s score, said that the children &quot;are passionate about music&quot;, which is &quot;some kind of escape to them&quot;.
==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for &quot;The Chorus&quot; was released on 3 May 2004 by Warner Bros. Records, and subsequently by Nonesuch Records in 2005 and Varèse Sarabande in 2012. It features the film&#x27;s original score, which was composed by Bruno Coulais and performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Deyan Pavlov) and the choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc. The album&#x27;s 2012 release added five additional tracks, most of which are the orchestral backing tracks of other songs. Filmtracks summed it up by saying &quot;for enthusiasts of boys&#x27; choirs and heartwarming, sentimental choral performances in general, &quot;The Chorus&quot; translates into a strong, albeit repetitive album.&quot; The soundtrack topped the albums chart in France for 11 weeks and reached number three in Belgium, before its United States release in early 2005. Around the same time, the live album &quot;Les Choristes en concert&quot; was released on both CD and DVD.

==Release==
In the United States, the film was shown at multiple film festivals—including the Chicago International Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, and the Heartland Film Festival—before opening in New York City and Los Angeles on 14 January 2005.

===Box office===
The film had a worldwide gross of $83,580,890 including $3,635,164 in the United States and Canada, $2,062,908 in the United Kingdom and $48,765,590 in its native France. It ranked 72 on the list of the highest-grossing films of 2005 worldwide, and 195 in the US and Canada.

===Home media===
&quot;The Chorus&quot; was released on DVD in France (as Les Choristes) on 27 October 2004 by Pathé. On 3 May 2005, Lionsgate released the film on DVD in the United States as &quot;The Chorus&quot;; on the same day, it was released by Alliance Films in Canada. On 11 July 2005, Pathé released a version with English subtitles in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
&quot;The Chorus&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 69% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating, based on 108 reviews, and an average rating of 6.5/10, indicating that most reviewed it positively, and summarises that &quot;While predictable, this low-key heartwarmer manages to be uplifting without overdoing the sentiment.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds an average score of 56 out of 100 based on 32 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Peter Howell of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; commended the film&#x27;s &quot;credible acting and outstanding score&quot;, saying they allowed it to &quot;[rise] above feelgood status&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s Matthew Leyland said &quot;even though all the notes are predictable, the film hits them with a wit, warmth and gusto.&quot; Many critics felt that the film&#x27;s format was predictable, and it was widely compared to other films about inspirational teachers, such as &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; and &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;; &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; commented &quot;if you&#x27;ve seen one inspirational-teacher melodrama ... you&#x27;ve seen this one, too&quot; and criticised the movie&#x27;s &quot;one-note characters&quot; and &quot;plodding predictability&quot;. Of the title characters, critic Roger Ebert said: &quot;Their influence will forever change the lives of their students, and we can see that coming from the opening frame&quot;, and that &quot;The Chorus&quot; &quot;should have added something new and unexpected&quot;. Ebert also commented that &quot;This feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film.&quot;

&quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; Manohla Dargis wrote: &quot;Like so many films ostensibly about children, &#x27;The Chorus&#x27; isn&#x27;t really interested in what kids think or what they want and why; the real point here is the adults, their passions, dreams and redemption.&quot;

== Awards and nominations ==
At the 77th Academy Awards, &quot;The Chorus&quot; was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song (the latter for &quot;Vois sur ton chemin&quot;, listed as &quot;Look to Your Path&quot;). At the 58th British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay (Christophe Barratier, Philippe Lopes-Curval) and Best Film Not in the English Language, and Bruno Coulais&#x27; score was nominated for Best Film Music. The film was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Golden Globe Awards. The 26th Young Artist Awards saw Jean-Baptiste Maunier nominated for Best Performance in an International Feature Film – Leading Young Performer, as well as &quot;The Chorus&quot; itself for Best International Feature Film. In France, the film won Best Sound (Nicolas Cantin, Nicolas Naegelen, Daniel Sobrino) and its score won Best Music Written for a Film at the 30th César Awards, where &quot;The Chorus&quot; received a further six nominations: Best Actor (Gérard Jugnot), Best Debut (Christophe Barratier), Best Director (Christophe Barratier), Best Film, Best Production Design (François Chauvaud) and Best Supporting Actor (François Berléand). In 2004, Bruno Coulais won the European Film Award for Best Composer; Gérad Jugnot was also nominated for Best Actor, and &quot;The Chorus&quot; for Best Film. The film later received the Lumières Award for Best Film in 2005, as well as London&#x27;s Favourite French Film award in 2007.

== Musical adaptation ==
In 2017, Christophe Barratier adapted the movie as a musical for the Folies Bergère in Paris.

<doc id="1204623" wikidata="Q2100701" url="?curid=1204623" title="Trifid cipher">
<text>The trifid cipher is a classical cipher invented by Félix Delastelle and described in 1902. Extending the principles of Delastelle&#x27;s earlier bifid cipher, it combines the techniques of fractionation and transposition to achieve a certain amount of confusion and diffusion: each letter of the ciphertext depends on three letters of the plaintext and up to three letters of the key.

The trifid cipher uses a table to &quot;fractionate&quot; each plaintext letter into a trigram, mixes the constituents of the trigrams, and then applies the table in reverse to turn these mixed trigrams into ciphertext letters. Delastelle notes that the most practical system uses three symbols for the trigrams:In order to split letters into three parts, it is necessary to represent them by a group of three signs or numbers. Knowing that &quot;n&quot; objects, combined in trigrams in all possible ways, give &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;3, we recognize that three is the only value for &quot;n&quot;; two would only give 23 = 8 trigrams, while four would give 43 = 64, but three give 33 = 27.

== Description ==

As discussed above, the cipher requires a 27-letter mixed alphabet: we follow Delastelle by using a plus sign as the 27th letter. A traditional method for constructing a mixed alphabet from a key word or phrase is to write out the unique letters of the key in order, followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet in the usual order. For example, the key FELIX MARIE DELASTELLE yields the mixed alphabet FELIXMARDSTBCGHJKNOPQUVWYZ+.

To each letter in the mixed alphabet we assign one of the 27 trigrams (111, 112, …, 333) by populating a 3 × 3 × 3 cube with the letters of the mixed alphabet, and using the Cartesian coordinates of each letter as the corresponding trigram.

From this cube we build tables for enciphering letters as trigrams and deciphering trigrams as letters:

The encryption protocol divides the plaintext into groups of fixed size (plus possibly one short group at the end): this confines encoding errors to the group in which they occur, an important consideration for ciphers that must be implemented by hand. The group size should be coprime to 3 to get the maximum amount of diffusion within each group: Delastelle gives examples with groups of 5 and 7 letters. He describes the encryption step as follows:We start by writing &quot;vertically&quot; under each letter, the numerical trigram that corresponds to it in the enciphering alphabet: then proceeding &quot;horizontally&quot; as if the numbers were written on a single line, we take groups of three numbers, look them up in the deciphering alphabet, and write the result under each column.

For example, if the message is &quot;aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot;, and the group size is 5, then encryption proceeds as follows:

 &quot;a i d e-t o i l e c i e l t&#x27;a i d e r a&quot;
 1 1 1.1 2 3 1 1.1 2 1 1 1.2 1 1 1 1.1 1
 3.2 3 1.1 1.2 1 1.2 2.1 1 1.3 2.3 1 3.3
 1 1.3 2 2 1 1.3 2 1 1 2.3 2 1 1 3.2 2 1
 F M J F V O I S S U F T F P U F E Q Q C

In this table the periods delimit the trigrams as they are read horizontally in each group, thus in the first group we have 111 = F, 123 = M, 231 = J, and so on.

<doc id="1204636" wikidata="Q1500359" url="?curid=1204636" title="Norge (airship)">
<text>The Norge was a semi-rigid Italian-built airship that carried out the first verified trip of any kind to the North Pole, an overflight on 12 May 1926. It was also the first aircraft to fly over the polar ice cap between Europe and America. The expedition was the brainchild of polar explorer and expedition leader Roald Amundsen, the airship&#x27;s designer and pilot Umberto Nobile and the wealthy American adventurer and explorer Lincoln Ellsworth who, along with the Norsk Luftseiladsforening|Norwegian Aviation Society (), financed the trip, which was known as the Amundsen-Ellsworth 1926 Transpolar Flight.

== Design and development ==

&quot;Norge&quot; was the first N-class semi-rigid airship designed by Italian aeronautical engineer Umberto Nobile and its construction began in 1923. As part of the sales contract to the Aviation Society, the airship was refitted for Arctic conditions. The pressurised envelope was reinforced with metal frames at the nose and tail, with a flexible tubular metal keel connecting the two. This was covered with fabric and used as storage and crew space. Three engine gondolas and the separate control cabin were attached to the bottom of the keel. &quot;Norge&quot; was the first Italian semi-rigid to be fitted with the cruciform tail fins first developed by the Schütte-Lanz company.

On 15 April 1924, the &quot;N-1&quot; was carried away from its base at Ciampino aerodrome by a violent wind gust. Two soldiers and a mechanic, who were unable to let go from the mooring lines, were carried 300 feet and dashed to death.

== Polar expedition ==

In 1925, Amundsen and Nobile met in Oslo, where the explorer proposed an airship expedition across the Arctic. With a contract in place, Nobile modified the already completed N-1 for flight in arctic weather. As the expedition was being financed by the Norwegian Aviation Society, the refitted N-1 was christened the &quot;Norge&quot; (English: &quot;Norway&quot;).
On 29 March 1926, at a ceremony at the aerodrome in Ciampino, the &quot;Norge&quot; was handed over to the Norwegian Aviation Society. The flight north was to leave Rome on 6 April but was delayed due to strong winds and departed at 09:25 on 10 April. The &quot;Norge&quot; arrived at RNAS Pulham Airship Station in England at 15:20 but due to bad weather, the ship was not moored inside the hangar until 18:30. Delayed again by weather, the &quot;Norge&quot; left Pulham for Oslo at 11:45 on 12 April.

At 01:00 on 15 April 1926, the &quot;Norge&quot; left Ekeberg in Oslo for Gatchina near Leningrad. Slowed by dense fog along the way, the airship arrived at 19:30 after a flight of 17 hours. After the arrival at Gatchina, Nobile announced that the &quot;Norge&quot; would remain in the hangar for a week for engine overhaul and maintenance; this included the addition of collapsible rubber boats for emergency use. Although scheduled to leave Gatchina as soon as the weather allowed after 24 April, the airship&#x27;s departure was delayed another week as the mooring mast at King&#x27;s Bay, Spitsbergen had not yet been completed due to adverse weather. Although Nobile was anxious to leave for Spitsbergen even if the mast and shed were not completed as he was concerned about the weather, the departure from Gatchina was postponed once again.
The &quot;Norge&quot; finally left Gatchina at 09:40 on the morning of 5 May to proceed to Vadsø in northern Norway, where the airship mooring mast still stands today. The expedition then crossed the Barents Sea to reach King&#x27;s Bay at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. There Nobile met Richard Evelyn Byrd preparing his Fokker Trimotor for his North Pole attempt. Nobile explained the &quot;Norge&quot; trip was to observe the uncharted sea between the Pole and Alaska where some believed land to be; at the time, Nobile believed Robert Edwin Peary had already reached the pole. King&#x27;s Bay would be the dirigible&#x27;s last stop before crossing the pole. The &quot;Norge&quot; then departed for the final stretch across the polar ice on the morning of 11 May, at 9:55.
The 16-man expedition included Amundsen, the expedition leader and navigator; Nobile, the dirigible&#x27;s designer and pilot; Lincoln Ellsworth, wealthy American outdoorsman and expedition sponsor, and polar explorer Oscar Wisting who served as helmsman. Other crew members were 1st Lt. Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, navigator; 1st Lt. Emil Horgen, elevatorman; Capt. Birger Gottwaldt, radio expert, Dr Finn Malmgren of Uppsala University, meteorologist; Fredrik Ramm, journalist; Frithjof Storm-Johnsen, radioman; Flying Lt. Oscar Omdal, flight engineer; Natale Cecioni, chief mechanic; Renato Alessandrini, rigger; Ettore Arduino, Attilio Caratti and Vincenzo Pomella, mechanics. Nobile&#x27;s little dog, Titina, who accompanied him everywhere, was also aboard as mascot.

On 12 May at 01:25 (GMT), the &quot;Norge&quot; reached the North Pole, at which point the Norwegian, American and Italian flags were dropped from the airship onto the ice. Relations between Amundsen and Nobile, which had been lukewarm at best, were aggravated by the uncomfortable conditions in the dirigible&#x27;s unheated, noisy control car and deteriorated further when Amundsen saw that the Italian flag dropped by Nobile was larger than either of the others. Amundsen later recalled with scorn that after he and Ellsworth had dropped the flags of their countries onto the ice, Nobile began tossing armfuls of different flags and banners overboard and the &quot;Norge&quot; had become &quot;a circus wagon of the skies&quot;, an occurrence Nobile later claimed Amundsen had greatly exaggerated.

After crossing the pole, the airship&#x27;s propellers became encrusted with ice to such an extent that pieces breaking off were flung against the outer cover, causing several rips and tears in the fabric. 
On 14 May, the &quot;Norge&quot; reached the Inupiat village of Teller, Alaska, where in view of worsening weather, the decision was made to land there rather than continue on to Nome, about 70 miles away. The &quot;Norge&quot; was reportedly damaged somehow during the landing and was dismantled and shipped back to Italy for repairs and refurbishing that was never undertaken.

The three previous expeditions that claim to have reached the North Pole—led by Frederick Cook in 1908, Robert Peary in 1909, and Richard E. Byrd in 1926 (just a few days before the &quot;Norge&quot;)—are all disputed as being either highly inaccurate or totally false. Some of those disputing these earlier claims therefore consider the crew of the &quot;Norge&quot; to be the first verified explorers to have reached the North Pole.

<text>Puss in Boots is a 1999 American animated adventure comedy film directed by Phil Nibbelink. It is based on the fairy tale of the same name.

The film features the voices of Judge Reinhold, Dan Haggerty, Michael York, and Vivian Schilling.

==Plot==
Puss in Boots serves as the narrator at the beginning of the film. He says that he used to belong to a poor miller and his three sons, the youngest being Gunther. Despite being the favorite, Gunther only inherits Puss after his father&#x27;s passing while his older brothers, Zeek and Zak, inherit the mill and their father&#x27;s donkey respectively. Zeek and Zak, envious of Gunther, kick him and Puss out.

Puss and Gunther walk through town when a carriage carrying the princess speeds past them, followed by a shape-shifting ogre who wants to marry the princess. The princess&#x27; carriage breaks loose during the chase and falls down a cliff. Puss and Gunther take the princess and her cat to the mill, where they are able to temporarily defeat the ogre, with Gunther and the princess becoming attracted to each other. The princess returns to the castle to tell her father, the king, that the ogre will return. Smitten with the princess&#x27; cat, Puss decides to get into the castle to see her again. He has Gunther buy a pair of boots for him, along with a cape and hat. Puss then enters the castle to entertain the king and princess. The ogre returns and threatens to destroy the kingdom if the princess does not marry him by sundown, taking her beloved cat as leverage so she won&#x27;t betray him. The princess decides to comply with the ogre&#x27;s demands.

Puss devises a new plan. He has Gunther pose as the &quot;Marquis of Carabas&quot;, a nobleman who can defeat the ogre. Puss directs the coachman to the Palace of Carabas, which is really the ogre&#x27;s castle and manages to arrive before them. He tricks the ogre into turning himself into a mouse and eats him. Then, as the carriage arrives, the ogre escapes Puss&#x27;s mouth and exposes Gunther as a fraud. The ogre throws Puss and Gunther into the dungeon below the castle and takes the princess inside to marry her. In the dungeon, Puss and Gunther have a brief falling out before quickly reconciling and escaping the dungeon with help from the princess&#x27; cat. Just before the ogre can marry the princess, Puss and Gunther break in and defeat him.

With the ogre gone, Gunther marries the princess while Puss marries her cat.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Marcus Ervine-Andrews, VC (29 July 1911 – 30 March 1995) was a British Army officer and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry that can be awarded to British and the Commonwealth forces, for his actions during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Marcus Ervine-Andrews was born in Keadue, County Cavan, Ireland, on 29 July 1911, the son of a bank manager. He was educated by the Jesuits at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, one of seven recipients of the VC who were educated at Stonyhurst.

Ervine-Andrews was commissioned in the East Lancashire Regiment, British Army in January 1932. He was sent to the Indian North West Frontier in 1936–37, where he was Mentioned in Despatches.

==Events at Dunkirk==
Ervine-Andrews was 28 years old, and a captain in the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (part of the 1st Infantry Division), in the latter stages of the Battle of Dunkirk, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. During the night of 31 May/1 June 1940, near Dunkirk, France, the company commanded by Captain Ervine-Andrews had been ordered to defend of territory. Already heavily outnumbered and under intense German fire, when the enemy attacked at dawn and crossed the Canal de Bergues, Ervine-Andrews, with volunteers from his company, rushed to a barn and from the roof, shot 17 of the enemy with a rifle, and many more with a Bren gun. When the barn was shattered and alight, he sent the wounded to the rear and led the remaining eight men back.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration were published in supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 30 July 1940, reading:
==Post-war==
Ervine-Andrews attempted to return home to his native County Cavan after the war, but was driven out by local members of the IRA and later settled in Cornwall. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

From 1955 he was involved with the Leonard Cheshire Foundation, first as the Warden of Wardour Castle Cheshire Home. After the Home closed in early 1957, he continued to advise the foundation on the setting up of new Cheshire Homes.

==Personal life==
Ervine-Andrews married Emily Torrie in 1939. Their marriage was dissolved in 1952. She died in 1975, thus permitting him to remarry, in 1981, to Margaret Gregory. 

Ervine-Andrews had two children with his first wife, a girl born in 1941 and a boy in 1943.

==Death==
The last surviving Irishman to be awarded the VC for service during the Second World War, Ervine-Andrews died in his home at Gorran, Cornwall on 30 March 1995, at the age of 83. His memorial is at Stonyhurst College. He bequeathed his VC medal to the Lancashire Infantry Museum, but at his request it is on display at Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery.

<doc id="1204652" wikidata="Q3580053" url="?curid=1204652" title="Edward VIII postage stamps">
<text>The Edward VIII postage stamps are a definitive stamp series issued in the United Kingdom during the 20 January – 11 December 1936 reign of King Edward VIII.

==The definitive issue==
The profile portrait chosen was taken by Hugh Cecil&#x27;s studio. The design was suggested by H.J. Brown, an 18-year-old man, and sent in February 1936 to the postal authorities. It inspired Harrison and Sons printers. The only graphic decorations on the stamp were the crown, the denomination in the upper corners, and the word &quot;POSTAGE&quot; at the bottom. Brown&#x27;s project, the simplest of all submissions, placed the words &quot;POSTAGE&quot; and &quot;REVENUE&quot; on the lateral sides. The Post Office wrote to Mr Brown telling him that his proposed design could not be used. After the stamp came out, clearly using Brown&#x27;s design, Brown&#x27;s father issued a statement regretting the Post Office&#x27;s deceit.

Watermarked with a crown and &quot;E8R&quot;, the d green, the d brown and the d blue stamps were issued on 1 September 1936, and the one penny red on 14 September. After Edward&#x27;s abdication, there was the usual delay in designing and distributing the stamps of George VI. Thus, the Edward VIII stamps remained on sale for months. That, and the large numbers saved by the public, have kept their collector value very low.

==Morocco Agencies==
The four or part of the four stamps were overprinted to be used in the British post offices in Morocco. For Tangier, the name of the town was overprinted alone. &quot;MOROCCO / AGENCIES&quot; was overprinted with a new face value in French centimes or Spanish céntimos depending on the zone of the post office.

==Other stamp projects==
===United Kingdom===
As soon as the beginning of the reign in January 1936, the British Post Office was preparing two other issues in addition to this &quot;accession issue&quot; of four definitive stamps: work was done at the Post Office and at Harrison &amp; Sons were done for a &quot;Coronation issue&quot;, previewed for the 12 May 1937, and a final &quot;Definitive issue&quot;. Essays for the former were made with the King wearing different military uniforms, such as Bertram Park&#x27;s pictures of Edward VIII wearing Seaforth Highlander and Welsh Guard uniforms. In March 1936, the King accepted the idea of larger stamps picturing his effigy and castles. But the abdication stopped all design efforts (despite essays having been made).

===Australia===
The 2d red stamp project of Australia used a photograph of the King in uniform. The sole ornaments were the denomination in an oval in the bottom right corner and the red &quot;POSTAGE&quot; bar at the bottom. Printing of this stamp began in September 1936 at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia&#x27;s printing branch. All operations were stopped with the abdication.

Despite the destruction of the stock and all material needed for the printing, a signed corner block of six 2d red stamps is in the hands of a British collector. On 29 September 1936, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, Governor of Victoria, visited the plant and was invited to sign and date one of the finished sheets. In the name of the Commonwealth Bank, printer John Ash offered the sheet to the Governor in October, but had to claim it back on 16 December. The sheet was given back the next day, but the six stamp corner block bearing the signature was missing. The Governor had already sent it to someone in England and could not retrieve it.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Edward VIII stamp dies and proofs were officially destroyed on 25 and 27 January 1937; some essays were kept in the archives, and the two plaster casts were saved by coin engraver Emmanuel Hahn and a postal officer.

In March 1936, the Canadian Post Office received the photographic profile the new King wanted to be used, and in June it obtained the one received by the Royal Mint. The Canadian Bank Note Company worked on traditional ornamented designs with the two pictures with the help of the American Banknote Company. In October, the Post Office received a plaster cast by British artist Hugh Paget. Finally, on 1 December 1936, the project was accepted by Lord Tweedsmuir, the Governor-in-Council. Two die-proofs were sent to London for the King to approve, but arrived after the abdication and were brought back to Canada.

The prepared design was used with a Bertram Park portrait of King George VI; this permitted an issue on 1 April 1937.

===Falkland Islands===
For the Falkland Islands, George Roberts redrew photographs of the archipelago&#x27;s fauna, human activities and coat of arms. These illustrations were inscribed inside a rectangular frame bearing two upper corner circles: the right side one for a crown and the left one for the profile of the King, from the same picture as the British issued series.

After the abdication, the projects were reworked by Roberts. Edward VIII&#x27;s profile in a circle was replaced by a picture of King George VI in an oval, with his military collar still visible. The stamp series was issued on 3 January 1938.

<text>James Langley Dalton VC (1833 – 7 January 1887) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces for service at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War.

==Military career==
Born in London in 1833, Dalton enlisted in 85th Regiment of Foot in November 1849 at the age of 17. In 1862 he transferred to the Commissariat Corps at the rank of corporal, and was promoted to sergeant in 1863, and clerk and staff sergeant in 1867. He served with Sir Garnet Wolseley on the Red River Expedition in Canada in 1870, retiring from the army the next year. By 1877, he was living in South Africa and volunteered for service as Acting Assistant Commissary with the British Force.

===Victoria Cross===
Dalton was approximately 46 years old, and an acting assistant commissary in the Commissariat and Transport Department (later Royal Army Service Corps), British Army during the Anglo-Zulu War when he was awarded the VC for his actions on 22 January 1879, at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Natal, South Africa.

His citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 17 November 1879 reads:
Dalton was not originally named among the VC recipients, eventually receiving his VC from General Hugh Clifford, VC at a special parade at Fort Napier on 16 January 1880.

==Death and legacy==
Dalton died in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. He is buried in the Russell Road Roman Catholic Cemetery with a memorial, Plot E. The precise location of his grave is 33° 57&#x27; 37&quot; S 25° 36&#x27; 53&quot; E.

The barracks in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, is named &quot;The Dalton VC Centre&quot; after him. Dalton Barracks, Abingdon, previously RAF Abingdon, also bears his name.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Logistic Corps Museum in Worthy Down, Winchester.

<text>That Darn Cat is a 1997 American mystery comedy film directed by Bob Spiers, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, and starring Christina Ricci and Doug E. Doug. It is a remake of the 1965 film &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot;, which in turn was based on the 1963 book &quot;Undercover Cat&quot; by Gordon and Mildred Gordon.

==Plot==
In the quiet Massachusetts town of Edgefield, a pair of bumbling kidnappers break into the house of wealthy Mr. Flint, intending to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom. However, they mistakenly kidnap his housemaid Lizzie instead.

Patti Randall is a troubled teenage girl struggling with the mundanity of her everyday life, and the fact her parents dislike the way she behaves and dresses. Every night, Patti&#x27;s cat D.C. (&quot;Darn Cat&quot;) leaves the house at 8 and causes mischief around the neighborhood, such as teasing dogs, stealing food, and playing with a distracted old lady&#x27;s birdcage. One night, D.C. walks into the kidnappers&#x27; hideout. Seizing her chance, Lizzie attempts to scratch &quot;HELP&quot; on her watch, but stops with the last letter incomplete (resembling a second &quot;L&quot;) when the kidnappers&#x27; phone rings. She attaches the watch to D.C., who returns home with it.

Patti sees the watch the next morning. Knowing of the kidnapping, she deduces it was from Lizzie and was meant to say HELP; however, no one believes her, so she doctors the evidence by turning the last incomplete letter into a &quot;P&quot;. Determined to take advantage of the exciting situation and save Lizzie, Patti goes to Boston and pleads her case to Agent Zeke Kelso of the FBI, who believes her. The Captain allows Zeke and his agents to tail D.C. during his nightly prowl in hopes he will show them the way to the kidnappers, but the operation goes nowhere, causing Zeke to be taken off the case. Zeke and Patti unsuccessfully attempt to investigate on their own, and eventually wind up arrested together. Shortly thereafter, Zeke learns that Patti tampered with the watch, and leaves in anger.

As punishment for her actions, Patti is grounded until further notice by her mother; distraught, she flees the house and takes a train out of town. However, after a conversation with another runaway, Lu, Patti comes to her terms and takes another train back to Edgefield. As she walks towards her house, Patti notices D.C. digging in a garden; he runs off, and she follows him to the kidnapper&#x27;s hideout, finally discovering Lizzie&#x27;s whereabouts.

Patti calls Zeke for help insisting her cat finally found the kidnapper’s location, but he is still upset with her and refuses to listen and believe her. So Patti decides to enter the hideout to intervene and save Lizzie herself, but the kidnappers return and capture her and D.C. Then after Patti’s parents listens to a voicemail Patti left for them. Patti’s parents report her missing to the police as a run away. After Patti&#x27;s parents call Zeke to ask if he knows where their daughter has run off to. Zeke also now fears that Patti has met the same fate as Lizzie. So to keep his job, Zeke changes his mind and reopens the case. His investigation leads him to the hideout, where he finds Patti and Lizzie bound and gagged, and D.C. trapped in a litter box.

Zeke exposes the identities of the kidnappers as the seemingly harmless &quot;Ma and Pa&quot;, the owners of the local candy shop. Ma and Pa kidnapped Lizzie because they had partied away all their cash in Monte Carlo and the Riviera, and were craving both more money and more excitement. Zeke manages to free Patti and D.C. while Ma and Pa escape with Lizzie in their car. D.C., Patti, and Zeke pursue them through the town, but due to an earlier sabotage caused by competing mechanics, the kidnapper&#x27;s car can only turn left, hindering their escape. During the chase a fence gets knock down, releasing the crazy local dog Smokey, who runs into the nearby cat show, scaring away all the competing cats. D.C. rallies the show cats to run with him along the roofs of the neighborhood and jump down onto Ma and Pa&#x27;s car, causing it to crash, foiling their crimes.

Ma and Pa are arrested and charged with kidnapping, Lizzie is reunited with the Flints, and Patti and D.C. return home and are hailed as heroes. The town returns to normal; Patti and Zeke become partners, and D.C. mates with the neighborhood cat and fathers a litter of kittens.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was mainly shot in the areas of Edgefield and North Augusta in South Carolina, as well as in Augusta, Georgia. Animal Makers created the animatronic version of the cat. It was filmed using a 35mm camera for both the colored moving and black and white still pictures.

Buena Vista Home Entertainment distributed the video in most regions, while Abril Vídeo covered Brazil.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $6,424,617 in its opening weekend and in total grossed $18,301,610 domestically.

It was theatrically released in Australia and New Zealand on August 28, 1997.

===Critical response===
The film currently holds a 13% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 critics, with an average rating of 4.1/10. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 36 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Holden of the &quot;New York Times&quot; was not impressed, remarking: &quot;The opening scenes in &quot;That Darn Cat&quot; suggest that the movie might have found a gently sarcastic attitude in tune with the know-it-all mood of the late 1990s ... Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t long before this wised-up tone gives way to a desperate, mindless freneticism that leaves Ms. Ricci mired in her sulk.&quot;

Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;It&#x27;s not quite a catastrophe, but the updated remake of &quot;That Darn cat&quot; is a loud and largely charmless trifle.&quot; James Berardinelli of &quot;Reelviews&quot; was a little more lenient, stating &quot;[the film] is a little more quirky than many Disney films, although that trait doesn&#x27;t make it appreciably more watchable.&quot;

In January 1998, it was included on Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s &quot;Worst Films of 1997&quot; episode.

==Accolades==
The film, in spite of the poor reception, earned Ricci two award nominations; the first was a Kids Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Movie Actress&quot; and the second was a Young Artist Award - &quot;Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film&quot;.

<doc id="1204657" wikidata="Q4286367" url="?curid=1204657" title="Henry Hook (VC)">
<text>Alfred Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Hook VC (6 August 1850 – 12 March 1905) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

==Background==

Born in Churcham, Gloucestershire, Hook originally served in the Monmouth Militia for five years before enlisting in the regular army in March 1877, aged 26. Previously serving in the 9th Xhosa War in 1877, he received a scalp injury during the battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, and discharged (by purchase) from the regular army 17 months later on 25 June 1880. 

The 1881 census shows Henry Hook V.C. as a servant in the household of George Owen Willis, a doctor in Monmouth, Monmouthshire.

He later served 20 years in 1st Volunteer Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, its drill hall located in Bloomsbury, reaching the rank of sergeant-instructor. After his 1880 discharge he was found the position of inside duster at the British Museum thanks to the intervention of Gonville Bromhead, Lord Chelmsford and the Prince of Wales. He was subsequently promoted to take charge of readers&#x27; umbrellas, before resigning due to ill health in 1904. During this period he lived at Sydenham Hill. He died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 12 March 1905 at Osborne Villas, Roseberry Avenue, Gloucester and is buried in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard, Churcham.

==Rorke&#x27;s Drift==
Alfred Henry Hook was 28 years old, and a Private in B Company of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Anglo-Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. Hook and five other privates were ordered on the afternoon of 22 January 1879 to protect approximately 30 patients unable to be moved from the temporary hospital at Rorke&#x27;s Drift station.

On 22/23 January 1879 at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Natal, South Africa, a distant room of the hospital had been held for more than an hour by three privates, and when finally they had no ammunition left, the Zulus burst in and killed one of the men and two patients. One of the privates (John Williams), however, succeeded in knocking a hole in the partition and taking the last two patients through into the next ward, where he found Private Hook. &quot;These two men then worked together – one holding the enemy at bayonet point while the other broke through three more partitions – and they were then able to bring eight patients into the inner line of defence.&quot;

==The medal==
He received his VC from Sir Garnet Wolseley, GOC South Africa at Rorke&#x27;s Drift on 3 August 1879. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the South Wales Borderers Museum, Brecon, Powys, Wales.

==In popular culture==
A poem describing Hook&#x27;s part in the battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift was written by William McGonagall in 1899.

In the film &quot;Zulu&quot;, Hook is depicted as an insubordinate malingerer placed under arrest in the hospital, only to come good during the battle. However, Saul David writes in his book, &quot;Zulu: The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879&quot;, that he was there as the hospital cook, subsequently as part of a small guard detail assigned to protect the patients. Saul David continues that far from the miscreant portrayed, Hook was actually a teetotaler, Methodist preacher, and model soldier. Further to this, he had been awarded good conduct pay shortly before the battle. His elderly daughters were so offended at the way their father had been depicted in the film that they walked out of the premiere. He was portrayed by English actor James Booth.

S.M. Stirling&#x27;s &quot;On the Oceans of Eternity&quot; fictionalises Hook&#x27;s exploits.

Hook can also be seen in a background scene in the Alan Moore-penned comic-series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, vol.I, issue 6.

==Related detail==
In his autobiography, punk singer Mark E. Smith claimed that Hook was an ancestor of his father, which led to the Smith family being invited as guests of honour to the Whitefield showing of &quot;Zulu&quot;.

<text>The 1908 VFL season was the twelfth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured ten clubs and ran from 2 May to 26 September, comprising an 18-match home-and-away season followed by a three-week finals series featuring the top four clubs. Victorian Football Association (VFA) club and Metropolitan Junior Football Association (MJFA) club featured for the first time in 1908.

 won the premiership, defeating by nine points in the 1908 VFL grand final; it was Carlton&#x27;s third (consecutive and overall) VFL premiership, marking the first time a club won three consecutive VFL premierships. Carlton also won its third consecutive minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 17–1 win–loss record. &#x27;s Dick Lee won his second consecutive leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1908, the VFL competition consisted of ten teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 18 rounds.

Once the 18 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1908 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended &quot;&quot;Argus&quot; system&quot;.

===Grand final===

==Season notes==
* Richmond Football Club and University Football Club were admitted to the VFL competition.
* With fiery former Collingwood coach Dick Condon as playing coach and former Collingwood champion Charlie Pannam as captain, Richmond won its first VFL match against Melbourne, 8.14 (62) to 7.9 (51). University had its first VFL victory in the second round of the season, beating Richmond 14.10 (94) to 12.4 (76).
* In the first round match between Fitzroy and South Melbourne at the Brunswick Street Oval, an umpire was hit by a stone thrown by a spectator.
* The sixth round match between Fitzroy and Essendon, also at the Brunswick Street Oval, was a fiery affair that resulted in a number of suspensions. A horde of Fitzroy supporters invaded the ground immediately the final bell had rung, kicking, punching and otherwise assaulting Essendon players as they tried to leave the playing field. Essendon fans also jumped the fence, in order to protect their players. A riot ensued.
* A ten-day Carnival, the &quot;Jubilee of Australasian Football (1858–1908)&quot; was held in Melbourne in August 1908, involving teams from New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia.
* At an official Carnival function, when proposing a toast to &quot;The Australasian Game&quot; the Prime Minister of Australia, the Melbourne-born Alfred Deakin (1856–1919) spoke of his youthful experiences of playing a rudimentary form of Australian football.

==Awards==
* The 1908 VFL Premiership team was Carlton.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Dick Lee of Collingwood with 54 goals.
* Geelong took the &quot;wooden spoon&quot; in 1908.

<doc id="1204662" wikidata="Q7417543" url="?curid=1204662" title="Sandymount Strand">
<text>Sandymount Strand () is a large strand on the east coast of Ireland, adjacent to the village and suburb of Sandymount in Dublin. It is part of South Bull - a major component of the south side of Dublin Bay, and part of the Dublin Bay Biosphere Reserve. South Bull is a mirror to the North Bull sandbank, which grew into North Bull Island.

Sandymount Strand is a popular place for locals to take a walk. People, and in the past - there is no longer public vehicular access - cars, have been occasionally trapped by the incoming tide. A large inlet of water that remains even at low tide is known locally as &quot;Cockle Lake&quot;.

== History ==
In the 1930s, the strand was included as a suggested location for the construction of a new Dublin airport.

==The baths==
The Merrion Promenade Pier and Baths Co built Sandymount swimming baths in 1883. The baths measured approximately 40 by 40 metres, with a 75-metre pier added in 1884. The pier featured a bandstand halfway along it and summer concerts were regularly held there for many years. By 1920, the pier had deteriorated so much that it had to be demolished. The concrete baths section, which resembles a small harbour, remains.

==Martello Tower==
About halfway along the strand is a Martello tower. Built in 1804, it is one of many such circular defensive watchtowers along the coastlines of the British Isles, as part of a system of defences to provide advance warning of a feared invasion by Napoleon. The Tower was used by the Dublin United Tramways Company as an office, and was also a popular cafe back in the 1960s. An attempt to turn the tower into a restaurant led to the installation of a large window with roller blinds on the seaward side of the tower. The restaurant never opened, leaving the tower with the modified window.
== &quot;Awaiting the Mariner&quot; (An Cailín Bán) ==
At the end of the strand walkway lies a 20-foot high metal sculpture donated by Mexican President Vicente Fox in November 2002, symbolizing the friendship between the Irish and Mexican people. This work, named &quot;Awaiting the Mariner&quot;, was created by Mexican sculptor Sebastián and was the first permanent work by a Mexican artist in Dublin. There was a mixed reaction from residents when the sculpture was originally placed.

== Gallan Gréine ==
The Gallan Gréine marker stone is located at the end of the strand beside the Irishtown playing fields. Carved by Cliodna Cussen and dedicated to James Joyce in 1983, a sighting stone stands 300 metres to the west and when aligned with the marker stone to the east, indicates the winter solstice with the sun rising over Killiney Hill around 21 December each year. The face of this stone is also a sundial.

==In fiction==

James Joyce based two episodes of his 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; along Sandymount Strand. In the third episode, &quot;Proteus&quot;, Stephen Dedalus wanders the strand, while later the same day, in the &quot;Nausicaa&quot; episode, Leopold Bloom sits on a rock and masturbates as he watches a young woman sunbathing.

<doc id="1204666" wikidata="Q1183652" url="?curid=1204666" title="Cuteness">
<text>Cuteness is a type of attractiveness commonly associated with youth and appearance, as well as a scientific concept and analytical model in ethology, first introduced by Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Lorenz proposed the concept of baby schema (&quot;Kindchenschema&quot;), a set of facial and body features that make a creature appear &quot;cute&quot; and activate (&quot;release&quot;) in others the motivation to care for it. Cuteness may be ascribed to people as well as things that are regarded as attractive or charming.

== Juvenile traits ==

Doug Jones, a visiting scholar in anthropology at Cornell University, said that the proportions of facial features change with age due to changes in hard tissue and soft tissue, and Jones said that these &quot;age-related changes&quot; cause juvenile animals to have the &quot;characteristic &#x27;cute&#x27; appearance&quot; of proportionately smaller snouts, higher foreheads and larger eyes than their adult counterparts. In terms of hard tissue, Jones said that the neurocranium grows a lot in juveniles while the bones for the nose and the parts of the skull involved in chewing food only reach maximum growth later. In terms of soft tissue, Jones said that the cartilaginous tissues of the ears and nose continue to grow throughout a person&#x27;s lifetime, starting at age twenty-five the eyebrows descend on the &quot;supraorbital rim&quot; from a position above the supraorbital rim to a position below it, the &quot;lateral aspect of the eyebrows&quot; sags with age, making the eyes appear smaller, and the red part of the lips gets thinner with age due to loss of connective tissue.

A study found that the faces of &quot;attractive&quot; Northern Italian Caucasian children have &quot;characteristics of babyness&quot; such as a &quot;larger forehead&quot;, a smaller jaw, &quot;a proportionately larger and more prominent maxilla&quot;, a wider face, a flatter face and larger &quot;anteroposterior&quot; facial dimensions than the Northern Italian Caucasian children used as a reference.

===Biological function===
Konrad Lorenz argued in 1949 that infantile features triggered nurturing responses in adults and that this was an evolutionary adaptation which helped ensure that adults cared for their children, ultimately securing the survival of the species. Some later scientific studies have provided further evidence for Lorenz&#x27;s theory. For example, it has been shown that human adults react positively to infants who are stereotypically cute. Studies have also shown that responses to cuteness—and to facial attractiveness in general—seem to be similar across and within cultures. In a study conducted by Stephan Hamann of Emory University, he found using an fMRI, that cute pictures increased brain activity in the orbital frontal cortex.

==Growth pattern of children==

Desmond Collins, who was an Extension Lecturer of Archaeology at London University, said that the lengthened youth period of humans is part of neoteny.

Physical anthropologist Barry Bogin said that the pattern of children&#x27;s growth may intentionally increase the duration of their cuteness. Bogin said that the human brain reaches adult size when the body is only 40 percent complete, when &quot;dental maturation is only 58 percent complete&quot; and when &quot;reproductive maturation is only 10 percent complete&quot;. Bogin said that this allometry of human growth allows children to have a &quot;superficially infantile&quot; appearance (large skull, small face, small body and sexual underdevelopment) longer than in other &quot;mammalian species&quot;. Bogin said that this cute appearance causes a &quot;nurturing&quot; and &quot;care-giving&quot; response in &quot;older individuals&quot;.

== Gender differences ==
The perceived cuteness of an infant is influenced by the gender and behavior of the infant. In the Koyama et al. (2006) research, female infants are seen as cute for the physical attraction that female infants display more than male infants, whereas research by Karraker (1990) demonstrates that a caregiver&#x27;s attention and involvement in the male infant&#x27;s protection could be solely based on the perception of happiness and attractiveness of the child.

The gender of an observer can determine their perception of the difference in cuteness. In a study by Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009), it was suggested that women were more sensitive to small differences in cuteness than the same aged men. This suggests that reproductive hormones in women are important for determining cuteness.

This finding has also been demonstrated in a study conducted by T. R. Alley in which he had 25 undergraduate students (consisting of 7 men and 18 women) rate the cuteness of infants depending on different characteristics such as age, behavioral traits, and physical characteristics such as head shape, and facial feature configuration.

==Preference in young children==
Borgi et al. stated that young children demonstrate a preference for faces with a more &quot;infantile facial&quot; arrangement i.e. a rounder face, a higher forehead, bigger eyes, a smaller nose and a smaller mouth. In a study that used three- to six-year-old children, Borgi et al. (2014) asserted that the children showed a viewing time preference toward the eyes of &quot;high infantile&quot; faces of dogs, cats and humans as opposed to &quot;low infantile&quot; faces of those three species.

== Hormones and cuteness variation ==
There are suggestions that hormone levels can affect a person&#x27;s perception of cuteness. Konrad Lorenz suggests that &quot;caretaking behaviour and affective orientation&quot; towards infants as an innate mechanism, and this is triggered by cute characteristics such as &quot;chubby cheeks&quot; and large eyes. The Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) study expands on this claim by manipulating baby pictures to test groups on their ability to detect differences in cuteness. The studies show that premenopausal women detected cuteness better than same aged postmenopausal women. Furthermore, to support this claim, women taking birth control pills that raise levels of reproductive hormones detect cuteness better than same aged women not taking the pill.

Sprengelmeyer gathered 24 young women, 24 young men, and 24 older women to participate in his study. He ran three studies in which images of white European babies were shown, and the participants were asked to rate them on a cuteness scale of one to seven. The study found differences among the groups in cuteness discrimination, which ruled out cohort and social influences on perceived cuteness. In the second study it was found that premenopausal women discriminated cuteness at a higher level than their postmenopausal female peers. This finding suggested a biological factor, which was then investigated further in the third study. Here, Sprengelmeyer compared cuteness sensitivity between premenopausal women who were, and were not taking oral contraceptives. The study concluded that post-perceptual processes were impacted by hormone levels (progesterone and estrogen specifically) in females, and thus impacted sensitivity to cuteness.

== Caregiving correlates ==
A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant&#x27;s head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of &quot;cute&quot;. However a study by Thomas Alley found no such correlation and pointed out faulty procedures in that study. Alley&#x27;s study found that cephalic head shape of an infant did induce a positive response from adults, and these children were considered to be more &quot;cute&quot;. In his study, Alley had 25 undergraduate students rate line drawings of an infant&#x27;s face. The same drawing was used each time, however the cephalic head shape was changed using a cardioidal transformation (a transformation that models cephalic growth in relation to ageing process) to adjust the perceived age; other features of the face were not changed. The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking. The study also noted that perceived cuteness was also dependent on other physical and behavioural characteristics of the child, including age.

In a study by McCabe (1984) of children whose ages ranged from toddlers to teenagers, the children with more &quot;adult-like&quot; facial proportions were more likely to have experienced physical abuse than children of the same age who had less &quot;adult-like&quot; facial proportions.

A study by Karraker (1990) suggested that &quot;an adult&#x27;s beliefs about the personality and expected behavior of an infant can influence the adult&#x27;s interaction with the infant&quot;, and gave evidence that in this way &quot;basic cuteness effects may occasionally be obscured in particular infants&quot;. Koyama (2006) said that an adult caregiver&#x27;s perception of an infant&#x27;s cuteness can motivate the amount of care and protection the caregiver provides, and the admiration demonstrated toward the infant, and concluded that &quot;the adults&#x27; protective feeling for children appeared to be a more important criterion for the judgment of a boy&#x27;s cuteness.&quot;

Melanie Glocker (2009) provided experimental evidence that infants&#x27; cuteness motivates caretaking in adults, even if they are not related to the infant. Glocker asked individuals to rate the level of cuteness of pictured infants and noted the motivation that these participants had to care for the infants. The research suggested that individuals&#x27; rating of the perceived cuteness of an infant corresponded to the level of motivation an individual had to care for this infant. Glocker and colleagues then used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to demonstrate that baby faces with higher content of baby schema features, generated more activation in the nucleus accumbens, a small brain area central to motivation and reward. This work elucidated the neural mechanism through which baby schema (&quot;Kindchenschema&quot;) may motivate (&quot;release&quot;) caretaking behavior. Furthermore, cute infants were more likely to be adopted and rated as more &quot;likeable, friendly, healthy and competent&quot; than infants who were less cute. There is an implication that baby schema response is crucial to human development because it lays the foundation for caregiving and the relationship between child and caretaker.

Sherman, Haidt, &amp; Coan (2009), in two experiments, found that exposure to high cuteness stimuli increased performance when playing the Operation game, a task that requires extreme carefulness. The study said that the shift in behavior toward greater carefulness is consistent with the viewpoint that cuteness is something that releases the human caregiving system. The study said that the shift in behavior toward greater carefulness also makes sense as an adaptation for caring for small children.

== Cultural significance ==
Doug Jones, a visiting scholar in anthropology at Cornell University, said that the faces of monkeys, dogs, birds and even the fronts of cars can be made to appear cuter by morphing them with a &quot;cardioidal&quot; (heart-shaped) mathematical transformation. Jones said that negative cardioidal strain results in faces appearing less mature and cuter by causing facial features at the top of the face to expand outward and upward while causing features at the bottom of the face to contract inward and upward.

Stephen Jay Gould said that over time Mickey Mouse had been drawn to resemble a juvenile more with a relatively larger head, larger eyes, a larger and more bulging cranium, a less sloping and more rounded forehead, shorter, thicker and &quot;pudgier&quot; legs, thicker arms and a thicker snout which gave the appearance of being less protrusive. Gould suggested that this change in Mickey&#x27;s image was intended to increase his popularity by making him appear cuter and &quot;inoffensive&quot;. Gould said that the neotenous changes to Mickey&#x27;s form were similar to the neotenous changes that occurred in human evolution.

Nancy Etcoff, Ph.D. in psychology from Boston University, said &quot;cartoonists capitalize on our innate preferences for juvenile features&quot;, and she mentioned Mickey Mouse and Bambi as examples of this trend. She said Mickey Mouse&#x27;s bodily proportions &quot;aged in reverse&quot; since his inception, because &quot;[h]is eyes and head kept getting bigger while his limbs kept getting shorter and thicker&quot;, culminating in him resembling a &quot;human infant&quot;. She further mentioned the &quot;exaggerated high forehead&quot; and the &quot;&quot; of Bambi as another example of this trend.

Mark J. Estren, Ph.D. in psychology from the University at Buffalo, said cute animals get more public attention and scientific study due to having physical characteristics that would be considered neotenous from the perspective of human development. Estren said that humans should be mindful of their bias for cute animals, so animals that would not be considered cute are also valued in addition to cute animals.

The perception of cuteness is culturally diverse. The differences across cultures can be significantly associated to the need to be socially accepted. &quot;Kawaii&quot; is a concept in Japanese popular culture that describes cuteness and innocence. &quot;Kawaii&quot; aesthetics are commonly found in anime and manga, and elements of it also appear in contemporary Japanese street fashion.

==Cute animals==
Sherman, Haidt, &amp; Coan (2009) used images of puppies and kittens for the study&#x27;s &quot;high cuteness&quot; stimuli in two experiments.

William R. Miller, assistant professor of biology at Baker University in Kansas, said that most people, upon seeing tardigrades, say that they are the cutest invertebrates.

Kenta Takada (2016) said that Miyanoshita (2008) said that the design of chocolates made to look like rhinoceros beetle larvae is a design that is both cute and disgusting.

Evolutionary biologists suspect that &quot;puppy dog eyes&quot;, a trait absent from wild wolves, were unintentionally selected for by humans during the domestication of dogs. In order to obtain pets with particularly cute faces, some breeds of dogs have been bred with increasingly severe cranial deformities called brachycephaly, for example, the French Bulldog, who consequently suffer from Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome.

<text>Aberffraw is a village and community on the south west coast of the Isle of Anglesey in Wales. The village is 9 miles from the island&#x27;s county town, Llangefni, and is on the west bank of the Afon Ffraw (Ffraw River). The community includes Soar and Dothan. It is on the A4080 and the nearest rail station is Bodorgan.

The village has a long history as a settlement from the Mesolithic Age. More recently, in medieval times, the site became the capital of the Kingdom of Gwynedd and a royal residence for the family of the House of Aberffraw.

The name of the village is often truncated to &quot;Berffro&quot; in the local dialect of Welsh. Local attractions include a part of the Anglesey Coastal Path, the beach and dunes at Aberffraw bay, a lake for recreational fishing, historic churches and prehistoric burial chambers.

==History==
Aberffraw is one of the oldest Mesolithic sites from prehistoric Wales, dating to years ago. At Aberffraw Bay is the &quot;Trwyn Du&quot; () site. The burial was discovered whilst excavating a Bronze Age kerb cairn (bowl barrow) from 2000 BC, which was excavated because of the threat of coastal erosion. The 1977 dig revealed that the cairn was built on top of a deposit of 7,000 flint tools and two axes from 7000 BC, a few millennia after the last Ice Age.

An intact monument near Aberffraw is Din Dryfol, a Neolithic chambered tomb from 3000 BC, and around the banks of the nearby River Gwna are the remains of a stone hut circle and roundhouses, which were lived in during the Welsh Iron Age, , until the British Roman period, before the 4th century.

In Welsh mythology Aberffraw features as the site of Branwen and Matholwch&#x27;s wedding festival, where Efnysien maimed Matholwch&#x27;s horses.

===Medieval Royal House of Aberffraw===

In the early Middle Ages Aberffraw was settled by Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion who built a palace in the 5th century. Rhodri the Great, the King of Gwynedd rebuilt the residence in the year 873 and had returned the capital of the Kingdom of Gwynedd to the Aberffraw cantref after Cadwallon ap Cadfan (c. 620) moved the royal court to Caernarfon in mainland Wales in the 7th century. Rhodri&#x27;s palace () became a royal court and his son Anarawd ap Rhodri started a cadet branch named the Royal House of Aberffraw. Anarawd&#x27;s descendants settled the area for centuries as Kings of Gwynedd and were eventually titled the Prince of Wales. Llywelyn ab Iorwerth in 1201 re-established the palace as a residence and installed personnel to work similarly to the original set up of the King&#x27;s royal suite based on the rules from they&#x27;re creation in 914. The court was then dismantled in 1317 to provide building materials for Caernarfon Castle across the Menai Strait.

The royal court was destroyed on Saint Nicholas Day, 6 December 1331, when a sandstorm buried 186 acres from Aberffraw north to Rhosneigr on the west of Anglesey in the Aberffraw cantref. This disaster drove families living in this area from their homes, and they migrated south to the villages of Llanddwyn and Newborough.

===Aberffraw cantref (hundred)===

The Meyrick () family of Bodorgan, Anglesey, were given the Crown lease for the manor lands of the Aberffraw cantref during the Tudor period (). Llewelyn ap Heilyn fought at the Battle of Bosworth alongside Henry VII of England. Afterward, Llewelyn&#x27;s son Meurig became captain of the bodyguard to Henry VIII and was rewarded with the lease. Today, the same family at Bodorgan Hall (near Aberffraw) is represented by the Tapps-Gervis-Meyrick baronets. After the &quot;Meyrick&quot; family ownership, it was the &quot;Owen&quot; family of Penrhos locally on Anglesey who owned the lands of Aberffraw until 1808. Subsequently, the &quot;Hughes&quot; family of Baron Dinorben, the &quot;Williams&quot; and &quot;Wynn&quot; families of Baron Newborough, then the Marquess of Anglesey &quot;Paget&quot; family, and finally &quot;Lord Bulkeley&quot; (Viscount) all briefly owned the lands surrounding . Today, the current town was developed in the mid to late 20th century. By 1949, the village was called the poorest in Anglesey.

===Attractions===
Attractions near Aberffraw village include Barclodiad y Gawres, a neolithic burial chamber. Also Llyn Coron is used for fly fishing. The village has a sandy beach, which was awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005. Aberffraw bay is a part of the Anglesey Coastal Path.

===Churches===
Near the village, on the tidal island of Cribinau, is St Cwyfan&#x27;s Church. Perched on top of a rock, the &quot;church in the sea&quot; was constructed in the 12th century and renovated in 1893–94. The church still holds services in the summer and is sometimes used for weddings.

St Beuno&#x27;s Church, Aberffraw is a double-naved church of the later medieval style. The building dates from the 12th century and is a Grade II* listed building. Additions to the church were made in the 14th and 16th centuries and a repair that involved reroofing the building in about 1840. There were extensive alterations made in 1868.

===Llys Llywelyn===

There is a holiday home accommodation in the village named , it was once a heritage centre dedicated to the history of the medieval Kingdom of Gwynedd and its royal court (llys) at Aberffraw. There is a sculpted piece of artwork by Jonah Jones dedicated to the Princes of Gwynedd. After more than a decade of negotiations, the heritage centre was moved to Llangefni and the centre was turned into holiday cottages in 2020. There is a cafe on site for visitors.

===Recreation and education===
The village has a Welsh football league system team named C.P.D. Aberffraw (&quot;Aberffraw FC&quot; in English); they play in the village of Bryn Du. There was a school at Aberffraw since before 1860, but the village school closed in 2011.

==Governance==
There was a change in the Anglesey UK electoral wards in 2013, reducing the number of councilors from 40 to 33. Aberffraw remained in the Bro Aberffraw area with 2 council members representing the Isle of Anglesey. As of the 2022 election, the ward is represented by Plaid Cymru councillors Arfon Wyn and John Ifan Jones.

===Demographics===
A historical census showed that the population in Aberffraw (Aberffro) grew from 936 in 1801 to 1,042 in 1971. In 1831, there were a total of 332 males in the village, and of those that were over the age of 20, 106 were farmworkers.

For the 2011 census, had a population of 620, with 334 fully fluent Welsh-speaking individuals, 146 who could not speak the Welsh language at all, and the rest of the population as partially fluent. The findings also showed 67.5% of the population could speak the Welsh language, a fall from 80.8% in 2001.

The 2021 census shows Aberffraw to have 597 residents, in an area of 29.55 km2; this was a reduction in population of 0.38% since the previous census from 2011.

==Former airfield==
RAF Bodorgan near the village was once known as the (Royal Air Force). Constructed in September 1940, the airfield was used in World War 2 as a testing site for military aircraft, Queen Bee, a pilotless airplane. In 1941, the airfield changed its name to Bodorgan, and by 1944 it was only used as a storage airfield. The grass runway airfield was closed in 1945. After the opening of the airfield in Aberffraw, another was opened during the same period, the airfield is based at Rhosneigr, Anglesey. RAF Valley is still in use today.

==Aberffraw dune system==
The Aberffraw dunes cover an area of in West Anglesey and are one of the biggest dune habitats in the UK. The dunes are preserved as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) and are part of a Special Area of Conservation which spans from Abermenai Point in the southeast of Anglesey, then across the island westward, and they are 5 km north-west of Newborough Warren. The most common species of plants are marram grass, which supports the sand and creates dunes, as well as early sand-grass, red fescue, and lady&#x27;s bedstraw. The dunes variety of natural flora and forna such as waterwort and weeds are supported by the local lake, Coron, as well as the river Ffraw. The area is a popular walking destination.

<doc id="1204686" wikidata="Q4932947" url="?curid=1204686" title="Bob Johnson (outfielder)">
<text>Robert Lee Johnson (November 26, 1905 – July 6, 1982), nicknamed &quot;Indian Bob&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. He played as a left fielder in Major League Baseball for three American League teams from 1933 to 1945, primarily the Philadelphia Athletics. His elder brother Roy was a major league outfielder from 1929 to 1938.

Johnson was the fifth player to have nine consecutive seasons of 20 or more home runs, and his 288 career home runs ranked eighth in major league history when he retired. Usually playing on inferior teams, he batted .300 five times, had eight seasons with 100 runs batted in, and finished his career among the AL&#x27;s top five right-handed hitters in career RBI (1,283), runs (1,239), slugging average (.506), total bases (3,501) and walks (1,075). He held the Athletics franchise record for career runs from 1942 to 1993. He also ranked among the AL leaders in games in left field (3rd, 1,592) and outfield putouts (10th, 4,003) and assists (8th, 208) when his career ended.

==Early years==
Born in Pryor Creek, Oklahoma, Johnson grew up in Tacoma, Washington, and thereafter made the city his home. His nickname was derived from his lineage, which was one-quarter Cherokee. Due to the abundance of quality outfielders in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he did not reach the major leagues until 1933, when he was 27.

==Major league career==
===Philadelphia Athletics===
Johnson joined the Athletics in , replacing Al Simmons, who had been traded to the Chicago White Sox. Philadelphia had won three straight pennants from 1929 to 1931, but after a second-place finish in 1932 owner-manager Connie Mack began gradually dealing away most of his star players in order to keep the club afloat financially during the Great Depression. As a rookie Johnson hit .290 with 20 home runs, 103 runs and 93 RBI, and was second in the AL with 44 doubles. But the team ended the season in third place; their 79–72 record was their last winning season until 1947, and they would occupy last place in six of Johnson&#x27;s 10 seasons, along with two seventh-place finishes. Catcher Mickey Cochrane and pitcher Lefty Grove were traded in December 1933, speeding the team&#x27;s decline.

Johnson took full advantage of playing in Shibe Park, which had long been a decidedly friendly environment for right-handed hitters such as Simmons and Jimmie Foxx. In Johnson improved his average to .307, including a 26-game hitting streak, and added a career-high 34 home runs along with 111 runs and 92 RBI; he also led the league with 17 assists. On June 16 he tied an AL record by going 6-for-6 with two home runs and a double. In 1935 he made his first All-Star team, had 103 runs and 109 RBI, and finished fourth in the AL in home runs (28) for the third straight year. Foxx and Doc Cramer were traded in late 1935, and over the next several years Johnson provided solid and consistent offensive production as the A&#x27;s remained mired at the bottom of the league. He was among the league&#x27;s top 10 home run hitters in every season through 1941, joining Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mel Ott and Foxx as the fifth player to have nine straight 20-home run campaigns. He also drove in over 100 runs in each year through 1941, scoring over 110 in 1938 and 1939; he was again an All-Star each year from 1938 through 1940. He set an AL record by driving in six runs in the first inning with a grand slam and a double off White Sox pitcher Monty Stratton on August 29, 1937; then, in an 8–3 victory over the St. Louis Browns on June 12, 1938, he drove in all the runs with three home runs and a single. That year, playing primarily in center field, he again led the AL with 21 assists.

After hitting .306 and .313 in 1937 and 1938, Johnson posted a career-high mark of .338 in – third in the AL behind Joe DiMaggio (.381) and Foxx (.360) – and placed eighth in the MLB Most Valuable Player Award voting; he was also third in the AL with 114 RBI. In , his last season with the Athletics, he made his fifth All-Star team and broke Foxx&#x27;s team record of 975 career runs; his final total of 997 remained the club record until Rickey Henderson broke it in . Johnson left the Athletics ranking second in franchise history to Jimmy Dykes in games (1,459) and at bats (5,428); second to Simmons in total bases (2,824); second to Foxx in home runs (252); and third behind Simmons and Foxx in hits (1,617) and RBI (1,040). He led the Athletics in RBI in each of his last seven seasons there following Foxx&#x27;s departure.

===Washington Senators===
In March 1943, after complaining that he was underappreciated, Johnson was traded at his request to the Washington Senators for outfielder Bobby Estalella and cash. He thrived in his first pennant race in years as Washington finished in second place, the second and last time he would be on a winning team. His veteran leadership was invaluable to the team, as despite posting career &quot;lows&quot; in nearly every offensive category – a .265 batting average, .400 slugging average, seven home runs, 63 RBI, 65 runs, 116 hits, 22 doubles, 117 games and 438 at bats – he placed fifth in the Most Valuable Player Award balloting (the highest finish of his career) and was again an All-Star. The decline in his offensive statistics is partially attributable to moving from hitter-friendly Shibe Park to cavernous Griffith Stadium; but as he did not even lead his own team in any category, the respect suggested by the Most Valuable Player vote is remarkable.

===Boston Red Sox===
At the end of the 1943 season, Johnson&#x27;s contract was purchased by the Boston Red Sox, a deal Washington owner Clark Griffith later described as his worst ever. At 38, Johnson had an excellent season for the Sox, collecting 106 RBI and 106 runs (both second in the league) in 144 games and leading the AL with a .431 on-base percentage. He hit for the cycle on July 6, came in third in the batting race with a .324 average (behind Lou Boudreau, .327, and teammate Bobby Doerr, .325), lost the slugging title to Doerr by a fraction of a point, and was 10th in the Most Valuable Player Award voting. He was named to the All-Star team in both 1944 and 1945, although the 1945 All-Star game was not played due to World War II travel restrictions. With numerous players returning to the major leagues from military service, he retired at the end of the season after hitting .280 with 12 home runs and 74 RBI.

===Statistics===
Johnson compiled a .296 career batting average with 2,051 hits, 396 doubles, 95 triples and 96 stolen bases in 1,863 games. His 1,592 games in left field then put him behind only Goose Goslin (1,949) and Bobby Veach (1,671) in AL history. Many modern baseball fans are unfamiliar with Johnson, but he posted excellent totals in 13 years before quietly retiring.

While primarily a left fielder, Johnson also played 167 games in center field, 39 games at first base, 28 games at second base, 27 games in right field, and 20 games at third base. He was ejected only once in his career, in 1937 by umpire Charles Johnston, for arguing balls and strikes.

Johnson spoiled no-hit games by getting the only hit for his club three times, one of them a homer off Yankee ace Lefty Gomez on June 30, 1937.

Johnson is one of three players in major league history to drive in all his club&#x27;s runs in a single game (minimum eight runs);
:On June 14, 1924, first baseman George Kelly hit three home runs to drive in all eight New York Giants runs in an 8–6 win over the Cincinnati Reds.
:Johnson matched this one-man offensive on June 12, 1938, when the Athletics beat the St. Louis Browns 8–3, driving in all the runs with two home runs (one a grand slam, his second of the month) and a single.
:The mark was surpassed on September 2, 1996, in a ten-inning game, when Mike Greenwell got all nine RBI in a Boston 9–8 victory over the Seattle Mariners.

Johnson was the first of only two players (the other was Ichiro Suzuki) to make his major league debut after his 27th birthday, and still finish with over 2000 hits. 

==Later years==
After leaving the major leagues, Johnson spent five more seasons in the minor leagues managing and playing for the Tacoma Tigers in the Western International League.

===Legacy===
In 1964, Johnson was inducted into the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame. He was honored by the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in 1989.

Baseball author Bob Carroll commented on Johnson; &quot;Indian Bob Johnson never had one of those super seasons that make everyone sit up and whistle. While phenoms came, collected their MVP trophies, and faded, he just kept plodding along hitting .300, with a couple dozen homers and a hundred ribbies year after year. Like a guy punching a time clock.&quot;

==Personal Life==
Bob Johnson was one of eight children, four boys and four girls.

His first wife was Caroline (Stout), whom he married in 1924. The couple had three children, daughters Roberta Louise and Beverly Jean, and son Robert Lee Johnson III. Robert Lee III died before turning one year old. Beverly died in 1953 of lupus.

Around the late 1940s or 1950, Johnson&#x27;s marriage to Caroline ended in divorce. In late 1950, Johnson married Betty (Pastore). The following year the couple had a son who carried a familiar name, Robert Lee Johnson III.

Bob Johnson died of heart failure on July 6, 1982, in Tacoma, at age 76.

<doc id="1204698" wikidata="Q335583" url="?curid=1204698" title="William Cavendish-Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland">
<text>William Arthur Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland, (16 March 1893 – 21 March 1977), styled Marquess of Titchfield until 1943, was a British peer and Conservative politician.

==Biography==
Portland was the elder son of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland, and his wife, Winifred Anna (née Dallas-Yorke). He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Newark in 1922, a seat he held until he succeeded his father in the dukedom in 1943, and served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury under Stanley Baldwin from 1927 to 1929 and under Ramsay MacDonald in 1932. He also held the honorary posts of Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire between 1939 and 1962 and was the second Chancellor of the University of Nottingham between 1954 and 1971. In 1948 he was made a Knight Companion of the Garter. He also held the appointment of the honorary air commodore of No. 616 Squadron RAF.

==Marriage and children==
Portland married Ivy Gordon-Lennox, daughter of Colonel Lord Algernon Charles Gordon-Lennox and granddaughter of Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond, on 12 August 1915. They had two daughters:

* Lady (Alexandra Margaret) Anne Cavendish-Bentinck (6 September 1916 – 21 December 2008)
* Lady (Victoria) Margaret Cavendish-Bentinck (9 October 1918 – 29 August 1955)

He died in March 1977, aged 84, and was interred at the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Portland, in the churchyard of St Winifred&#x27;s Church at Holbeck.

He was succeeded in the dukedom by his third cousin Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck. The subsidiary title Baron Bolsover became extinct on the death.

The heir to the Duke&#x27;s titles was a distant cousin. Rather than allow the entailed estates to pass with the titles, the Duke arranged to break the entails and thus enrich his own daughters while permanently denuding the titles of both wealth and long-standing rootedness in land and country. The family seat of Welbeck Abbey passed to his elder daughter, Lady Anne, who never married; upon her death, it passed to the son of her deceased younger sister, Lady Margaret, who had died in 1955 aged 36. Lady Margaret had been married to Don Gaetano Parente, Principe di Castel Viscardo, Italy. Her son, named William Henry Marcello Parente (born 18 February 1951), inherited the estates and later served as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 2003. Meanwhile, the 8th Duke of Portland, who had inherited the titles, continued to live very modestly in Nairobi.

Portland was a second cousin of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

==Wealth==
Little is published of his wealth. His probate was sworn in 1977 at , three times that of his father&#x27;s assets passing at point of death (in real terms).

<doc id="1204699" wikidata="Q1102396" url="?curid=1204699" title="That Darn Cat!">
<text>That Darn Cat! is a 1965 American thriller comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson and starring Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in a story about bank robbers, a kidnapping and a mischievous cat. Produced by Walt Disney Productions, the film was based on the 1963 novel &quot;Undercover Cat&quot; by Gordon and Mildred Gordon. The title song was written by the Sherman Brothers and sung by Bobby Darin.

&quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; was Hayley Mills&#x27; last film of the six she appeared in for the Walt Disney Studios until she returned in 1986 for three &quot;Parent Trap&quot; films. Mills later said it was a mistake to leave Disney. It was Dean Jones&#x27; first film for Disney. A remake of the film was released in 1997, and features a cameo appearance by Jones.

==Plot==
&quot;Darn Cat&quot; or &quot;DC&quot; is a wily, adventurous Siamese tomcat, who lives with young suburbanite sisters Ingrid &quot;Inky&quot; and Patricia &quot;Patti&quot; Randall. He enjoys an evening route wandering through town, which includes teasing local dogs, swiping food, and marking vehicles with muddy paws.

One night, DC follows bank robber Iggy into the apartment where Iggy and his partner Dan are holding bank employee Margaret Miller hostage. Miss Miller uses the opportunity to replace DC&#x27;s collar with her watch, on which she has inscribed most of the word &quot;HELP&quot;.

DC returns home to the Randalls; Patti discovers the watch, and suspects that it belongs to the kidnapped woman. She goes to the FBI and tells Agent Zeke Kelso of her discovery. Supervisor Newton assigns Kelso to follow DC in the hope that he will lead them back to the robbers&#x27; hideout.

Kelso sets up a headquarters in the Randalls&#x27; house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance. Despite multiple attempts and a bugging system, DC eludes them in humiliating and comedic ways, culminating in a chase where he leads Agent Kelso through several back yards and a drive-in theatre. As DC ends up trying to open a pigeon cage, he is discovered by the owner Gregory Benson, who is in Ingrid&#x27;s carpool. Benson chases DC and Kelso out and angrily announces he is leaving the carpool.

The next day, agent Kelso&#x27;s supervisor Newton shuts down the operation, determining the watch not a useful clue. Patti disguises herself as the hippie niece of her friend Mr. Hoffstedder the jeweler, and persuades the FBI that the watch is indeed hard evidence. Newton and Kelso set up one last surveillance from the Randall home and trail DC through several neighborhoods before finally arriving at the bank robbers&#x27; hideout. Kelso enters the apartment just in time to save Miller&#x27;s life, and Patti enters moments later in an attempt to keep Kelso alive. After a brief scuffle, the kidnappers are arrested and Miss Miller is liberated.

In the epilogue, Patti reconciles with her on-and-off-boyfriend Canoe, who has suffered with jealousy due to the secretive nature of the FBI investigation. Kelso becomes Ingrid&#x27;s new carpool and begins a romance with her, while DC starts a family with a gray cat he has been visiting on his nightly rounds.

==Production==
The exterior neighborhood scenes were filmed on The Walt Disney Studios backlot in Burbank, California.

Each of the Seal Point Siamese cats who collectively play the role of DC is a so-called &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;old style&quot; Siamese, as opposed to the more dainty, long and tubular modern Siamese show cat. One of the cats used for the film belonged to longtime cat breeder Edith Williams, a member of the Stud Book Fanciers Association. One of the feline actors also starred, along with two dogs, in Disney&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Incredible Journey&quot;.

==Reception==

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The feline that plays the informant, as the F.B.I. puts it, is superb. Clark Gable at the peak of his performing never played a tom cat more winningly. This elegant, blue-eyed creature is a paragon of suavity and grace&quot;, and concluded, &quot;it&#x27;s an entertaining picture. Even a king might profitably look at &quot;That Darn Cat&quot;.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;Walt Disney comes up with a novelty charmer in this lilting translation of the Gordon&#x27;s [sic] whimsical tale of a Siamese cat who helps the FBI solve a kidnapping case.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated: &quot;As a detective story, &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; is strictly for juveniles and the juvenile-minded. It contains little of the step-by-step development which in good detective stories brings out the sleuthing in all of us, being content to settle for a series of gags in which that darn cat, a brownish Siamese, leads the FBI and others on a number of false scents till he and we finally barge in on the criminals.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared: &quot;&quot;That Darn Cat&quot; is a dandy Christmas present for everyone except the Scrooges. Children will enjoy its pranks, adults its whimsy, cat-lovers its Siamese and even J. Edgar Hoover won&#x27;t mind this use of the FBI.&quot; Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a typical product of the giant Disney flapdoodle factory, which for many years now has devoted itself to grinding out lavish falsifications of contemporary life.&quot;

In September 1965, Hedda Hopper reported Disney had commissioned a sequel from the Gordons enritled &quot;Undercover Cat Prowls Again&quot; but it was not made.

The film holds a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews.

<doc id="1204700" wikidata="Q591000" url="?curid=1204700" title="Spring Triangle">
<text>The Spring Triangle is an astronomical asterism involving an imaginary triangle drawn upon the celestial sphere, with its defining vertices at Arcturus, Spica, and Regulus. This triangle connects the constellations of Boötes, Virgo, and Leo. It is visible in the evening rising in the southeastern sky of the Northern Hemisphere between March and May and setting until August, while at morning rising and setting from November to the end of February.

George Lovi of Sky &amp; Telescope magazine had a slightly different Spring Triangle, including the tail of Leo, with Denebola replacing Regulus. Although Denebola is dimmer, this triangle is more nearly equilateral. These stars, together with Cor Caroli, form parts of a larger spring asterism called the Great Diamond.

==The stars of the Spring Triangle==
=== Arcturus (α Boötes) ===
Arcturus is a giant orange star in the constellation Boötes. Located only 37 light years away, it has an apparent magnitude of -0.04. It is the brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere and fourth brightest in the night sky.

Because it is spotted easily, Arcturus was identified by ancient humans and tied to mythological ideals. The star was given its name from the ancient Greek Ἀρκτοῦρος (&quot;Arktouros&quot;), which translates to &quot;Guardian of the Bear.&quot; This name was selected because of the star&#x27;s proximity to Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, surmising the two bear constellations were guarded by Arcturus.

Arcturus is thought to be around 6 to 8.5 billion years old, and has traveled up the red-giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as it has expanded in size. The star has a diameter of around 36 million km, making it about 26 times larger than the Sun. Despite this size difference, the mass of Arcturus is only 1.1 times that of the Sun. 

With its high speed of 122 km/s (270,000 mph) and a path which crosses the galactic plane rather than residing within it, Arcturus may have formed outside of the Milky Way. The star is the namesake of a group of 52 other stars named the Arcturus moving group or Arcturus stream, all of which share a similar proper motion. It has been proposed that these stars are remnants of an ancient dwarf satellite galaxy that was assimilated into the Milky Way long ago. 

=== Spica (α Virginis) ===
Spica is a binary blue-white star pair that appears as a single point of light from Earth, and is commonly if incorrectly referred to as a single star. The star system is 250 light years away and has an apparent magnitude of 1.04. It is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo, and is the 15th brightest star in the night sky. The name Spica is derived from a Latin phrase that describes the zodiac sign Virgo as holding an ear of grain, &quot;spīca virginis.&quot; Virgo the Maiden is often represented as a young woman holding this stalk of grain. 

The best times of the year to view this star are during early spring to late summer in the Northern Hemisphere. To find this star easily, locate the Big Dipper and follow the curve of its handle. This curve will first lead to Arcturus. Finally, &quot;drive a spike&quot; directly to Spica.
Spica is made up of two individual stars, Spica A and Spica B, with radii of 7.40 and 3.64 times the Sun&#x27;s, respectively. Their sizes contribute greatly to the brightness of the stars. Spica A&#x27;s luminosity is 12,100 times that of the Sun, while Spica B has a luminosity of 1,500. Their sizes lead to respective surface temperatures of 22,400 K and 18,500 K, much higher than the Sun. They are separated by a distance of only 0.12 AU with an orbital period of only four days. This proximity gravitationally distorts each star into an egg shape, with the pointed ends facing each other.

=== Regulus (α Leonis) ===

Regulus, the brightest object in the constellation Leo, is a quadruple star system made up of two separate pairs of stars. At 79 light years away and an apparent magnitude of 1.35, Regulus is the 21st brightest star in the sky. The name Regulus, which translates to &quot;little king&quot; in Latin, was given to the system by Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century. The star can be seen at the base of the head of Leo that looks like a backwards question mark, which is also referred to as the Sickle. 

The brighter pair of stars is called Regulus A, which is made up of a large visible bright blue star and its companion, Regulus D, which is possibly a white dwarf, though this is unconfirmed. This smaller companion has a mass of only 0.3 solar masses, while the mass of the larger is 3.8 solar masses. The pair are close at 0.35 AU apart, with a short orbital period of 40.11 days around a center mass. The other two stars are the main sequence orange dwarf Regulus B and its red dwarf companion Regulus C. With apparent magnitudes of 8.13 and 13.50, they can&#x27;t be seen with naked eye. This means the entire system is named after its brightest star. 

Regulus A appears egg-shaped due to an extreme rotational speed. While the Sun rotates on its axis once every 27 days at a speed of 7,242 kph (4,500 mph), Regulus rotates every 16 hours at 1.1 million kph (700,000 mph). Astronomers have determined that if the star rotated 10% faster it would rip itself apart.

=== Denebola (β Leonis) ===

Denebola is a white main sequence star in the constellation Leo. With a distance of 36 light years from Earth, and an apparent magnitude of 2.14, it is the third brightest star in the constellation and the 62nd in the night sky. This star has often taken the place of Regulus in the Spring Triangle. While Regulus has a higher magnitude, Denebola makes the triangle more equilateral in appearance. 

The star&#x27;s name comes from the Arabic phrase Deneb Elased, or ðanab al-asad, meaning &quot;the tail of the lion.&quot; This refers to the star&#x27;s position in the constellation at the lion&#x27;s tail end. Denebola has a mass of 1.78 solar masses and a radius of 1.728 solar radii, making it almost twice the size of our sun. It may be a Delta Scuti type variable star due to its variations in brightness; about 10 times a day the star&#x27;s brightness fluctuates in magnitudes around 0.025.

== Deep Sky Objects ==

The Spring Triangle contains multiple objects of note, with a large amount of them belonging to the Virgo Cluster. This cluster contains around 1,500 galaxies and can be seen between the stars Denebola and Vindemiatrix, with many being notable Messier objects.

=== Messier 87 ===

The brightest galaxy seen in the cluster is the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87. With an apparent magnitude of 9.6, the galaxy can be seen using a telescope, as it was first seen by Charles Messier in 1781. Located 54 million light years away and at 130,000 light years across, M87 houses several trillions of stars and around 15,000 globular star clusters. For comparison, the Milky Way is 105,700 light years across and contains around 200 billion stars.

At the center of this galaxy there is a supermassive black hole (of 6.5 billion solar masses) bearing a large blue jet of subatomic particles accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light. In 2019, an image of this black hole, designated M87*, was published by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration -- the first picture of a black hole ever released.

=== Messier 49 ===
Messier 49 is the brightest galaxy in the Virgo group with an apparent magnitude of 9.4. This brightness allowed M49 to be the first observed in the group, by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752. The giant elliptical galaxy is located 56 million light years from Earth, and is around 157,000 light years across, with more than 200 billion stars. 

=== Siamese Twins Galaxies (NGC 4567 and NGC 4568) ===

Also known as the Butterfly Galaxies, NGC 4567 and 4586 are two unbarred spiral galaxies that are colliding. The pair were first discovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1784, but did not earn their name until observer Ralph Copeland called them the Siamese Twins in the late 1800s due to their almost identical shape and structure. The galaxies are located around 52 million light years away, with a separation between the cores of around 20,000 light years. The more distant galaxy, NGC 4567, has an apparent magnitude of 11.5 and is oriented almost completely face-on with our galaxy. The closer galaxy, NGC 4568, has an apparent magnitude of 11.2 and is oriented at a diagonal. It was originally believed that the two were simply passing directly behind each other in the same line of sight, but further observations and studies have observed a high rate of star formation where the galaxies overlap, confirming that they are undergoing the early phases of collision and merging.

=== Other Objects ===
There are many other notable members in the triangle, including Messier 60, Messier 84, and Messier 86. Two named groups of galaxies are the Eyes Galaxies (NGC 4435 and NGC 4438) and the Leo Triplet (NGC 3628, Messier 65, Messier 66).

<text>Bjørn Grinde is a Norwegian biologist and author working as a scientist in the fields of genetics and evolution, with particular interests in human evolution, behaviour, happiness and consciousness.

== Early life and education ==
He was born and grew up in Oslo, Norway, but spent a year as a high-school exchange student at Michigan, USA, in 1969.

He studied natural sciences as well as psychology, anthropology, and pedagogics at the University of Oslo, resulting in a Dr.scient (1981) and a Dr.philos (1984) in biology from the same university.

== Work roles ==
Grinde has worked as a scientist and professor at leading universities in Norway, USA, and Japan. Before his retirement, he worked as a senior scientist at the Division of Mental and Physical Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

==Areas of interest and research==

===Molecular evolution===
Some of his earlier projects focused on molecular evolution, using viruses as a model system.

===Human behavioral biology===
For the later part of his career, the focus has been on understanding how evolution has shaped the human brain with particular reference to what consciousness is and why it serves us positive and negative experiences. The field of science is related to evolutionary psychology. One aim is to find ways to improve mental health and quality of life. The approach is based on the idea that natural selection has shaped the human brain; consequently, our evolutionary history has an impact on feelings and behavior. Our brain evolved to serve hunting and gathering behavior in tribal (Stone Age) groups, it is therefore not optimal for the present way of living. Fortunately, humans have the most adaptive and moldable brain of any species, the aim of society should therefore be to create an environment that makes the most of our inherent qualities nature.

Grinde suggests that happiness is best understood as a question of the net level of positive and negative feelings. Feelings are primarily initiated by the unconscious brain, but can be modified by conscious effort, thus it is possible to improve on happiness by exercising the brain and by seeking an appropriate environment. One strategy as to brain exercise is to use meditative techniques and include words or sentences (by &#x27;self-talk&#x27;) that activate either the capacity to turn off negative feelings or to turn on positive feelings.

He has published some 170 scientific articles and several books. Some of his work has been translated to Italian, Arabic, and Chinese. He has lectured on this topic around the world.

<text>George Lemuel Woods (July 30, 1832 – January 7, 1890) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician. A member of the Republican Party, Woods served as the third Governor of Oregon from 1866 to 1870. Failing to win renomination, Woods was then appointed Territorial Governor of Utah by President Ulysses S. Grant, serving in that position from 1871 to 1875.

==Biography==
===Early years===

George Lemuel Woods was born July 30, 1832, in Boone County, Missouri, the second of four boys born to Caleb Woods and the former Margaret McBride. His ancestors came to North America from Scotland in the late 17th Century, settling first in Virginia before moving to the Kentucky frontier. His father had moved to Missouri in 1808.

In 1847, when George was just 15, his parents moved to the Oregon Territory. In Oregon, the family settled in Yamhill County, George was educated in the public schools.

In April 1852, Woods was married to Louisa A. McBride. The couple had two sons. The young couple took a homestead on unimproved government land, which Woods cleared, fenced, and plowed.

Unsatisfied with rural life, in 1856 Woods sold his property and enrolled at McMinnville College, where he studied law. Working as a carpenter during the day and studying at night, Woods purchased a small law library and was eventually admitted to the bar in 1858, setting up a private practice. Woods proved capable at the task and gained recognition as a proficient attorney.

===Political career===

In 1857, Woods organized Republican clubs in the state and was a noted speaker of the party.

Woods was appointed a judge in Wasco County in 1863. He was nominated as a presidential elector in March 1864 and was active in the campaign to re-elect Abraham Lincoln to the presidency, gaining a following as an eloquent and effective orator and stump speaker. Woods toured the state as leading representative of the National Union Party (Republican-Pro-War Democrat coalition), debating the anti-war Democrat Aaron E. Wait, Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.

In 1865 he was appointed to serve on the Idaho Territory’s Supreme Court, but before his formal commission arrived he was nominated for governor by the Union Party. Woods won election over his Democratic opponent, prominent attorney James L. Kelly, in a heated and intense campaign, becoming the third Governor of the state of Oregon. His term began on September 12, 1866, and continued until September 14, 1870.

An 1870 portrait of Woods by one who had heard him speak on numerous occasions characterized the &quot;positive and magnetic&quot; Governor as
&quot;...tall, graceful, and commanding, with a handsome, cheerful face, which is set off by a full, flowing beard and manifesting the utmost mental activity... His manner of speaking is rapid, but distinct and impressive, never using long or high-sounding words or indulging in any extravagance or impropriety or metaphor. He seems to depend on the natural forces of ideas rather than upon the sonorousness of words; and although never written, unless by some very swift reporter at the time of their delivery, his speeches would be considered well adapted to the most refined of lecture-rooms... Perhaps no American orator is capable of a quicker or keener retort, but it is a cut from a rapier, rather than a stroke with a bludgeon.&quot;

Woods&#x27; prowess as a public speaker placed him in demand for other candidates around the country, and he made campaign speaking tours on behalf of Republican candidates in California in 1867 — where he made 30 speeches in 35 nights — and the New England states of New Hampshire and Connecticut in 1868.

Woods failed to win re-election but was immediately appointed by new Republican President Ulysses S. Grant as the Governor of Utah Territory in 1871. Woods proved to be a critic of Mormon leader Brigham Young, and was not reappointed in 1875 at the conclusion of his term. During his term as governor, a &quot;lion&#x27;s share&quot; of the new Japanese government under Emperor Meiji stayed in Salt Lake City on their way from San Francisco to Washington, DC as part of the first Japanese embassy to the United States. Governor Woods gave a speech to the delegation extolling the virtues of American industry, with its ability to erect a city in a &quot;howling wilderness.&quot;

==Later life==
After leaving the Utah governorship Woods moved to California, where he remained for ten years. He then returned to Oregon in 1885, where he died on January 7, 1890. Woods was buried at River View Cemetery in Portland, Oregon.

<text>Millsap or Millsaps is a surname of English and Irish origin. Derived from a nickname for a &quot;spiritless man&quot;, the name is borrowed from Middle English for &quot;milksop&quot;, meaning &quot;piece of bread soaked in milk&quot;. It has been suggested that it may have been an occupational name for a farmer who dealt with milk products. 

A variant, Millsop, is also derived from similar origins, and is found in County Armagh and County Down in Ulster.

<doc id="1204717" wikidata="Q813868" url="?curid=1204717" title="Bedford College, London">
<text>Bedford College was founded in London in 1849 as the first higher education college for women in the United Kingdom. In 1900, it became a constituent of the University of London. Having played a leading role in the advancement of women in higher education and public life in general, it became fully coeducational (i.e. open to men) in the 1960s. In 1985, Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College, another constituent of the University of London, to form Royal Holloway and Bedford New College. This remains the official name, but it is commonly called Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL).

==History==
===Foundation===
The college was founded by Elizabeth Jesser Reid (&quot;née&quot; Sturch) in 1849, a social reformer and anti-slavery activist, who had been left a private income by her late husband, Dr John Reid, which she used to patronise various philanthropic causes. Mrs Reid and her circle of well-educated friends believed firmly in the need to improve education for women. She leased a house at 47 Bedford Square in the Bloomsbury area of London and opened the Ladies College in Bedford Square. The intention was to provide a liberal, non-sectarian education for women, something no other institution in the United Kingdom provided at the time. Reid placed £1,500 (GBP) with three male trustees and persuaded a number of her friends to serve on the management committees and act as teaching professors. In their first term they had 68 pupils.

Initially the governance of the college was in the hands of the Ladies Committee (comprising some influential women) and the General Committee made up of the Ladies, the professors of the college and three trustees. It was the first British institution partly directed by women. The General Committee (later the council) soon took over the running of the college, while the Ladies Committee directed the work of the Lady Visitors, who were responsible for the welfare and discipline of the students, and acted as their chaperones. Initially the professors were shocked by the generally low educational standards of the women entering the college, who in most cases had only home-based governess education. In response, Reid founded Bedford College School close to the college in 1853, in an attempt to provide a better standard of entrants. In 1860, the college expanded into 48 Bedford Square, which enabled it to become a residential establishment. &quot;The Residence&quot; was in the charge of a matron, who introduced the practice of students help to run the house and keep their own accounts.

===Succession===
Elizabeth Reid died in 1866 and left a trust fund and the leases of the college&#x27;s buildings in the hands of three female trustees Eliza Bostock, Jane Martineau and Eleanor Smith. The three of them were concerned that Bedford College School was to become Anglican under the head, Francis Martin. They closed the school although the idea went on without the trustees support as the Gower Street School being led, in time, by Lucy Harrison in 1875.

The trustees insisted on a new constitution (as the college had no legal charter at the time). The council was replaced by a committee of management and the college reconstituted as an association under the Board of Trade and officially became known as Bedford College.

In 1874, the Bedford Square lease expired and the college moved to 8 and 9 York Place, off Baker Street. Eliza Bostock was still a trustee but many looked to her as honorary principal and with her knowledge of building and architecture she organised the college&#x27;s move to York place. The two houses, 8 and 9, acted as one, with the college using the downstairs rooms and the upstairs being the Residence. As numbers began to rise, the college expanded by adding extensions to house science laboratories. In the late 1870s, an entrance examination was introduced and a preparatory department set up for those who did not meet the standards required for college-level entry.

===Women with degrees===
In 1878, degree examinations of the University of London were opened to women. Bedford College students began gaining University of London Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science and Master&#x27;s degrees from the early 1880s. In 1891 the college began training women graduates to teach secondary students. In 1910 Sara Melhuish was appointed as the head of training and within five years there were sixty students and four specialist staff.

In 1900, the University of London became a teaching university (before, it had only awarded university degrees); Bedford College became one of its constituent colleges. It applied to the Privy Council for a royal charter to take the place of its deed of incorporation. Royal assent for the university charter was received in 1909, and the college became officially recognised as Bedford College for Women.

Continued growth led to a search for new premises, leading to the purchase of the lease on a site at Regent&#x27;s Park in 1908. A major fund-raising effort was undertaken to provide it with modern amenities. The purpose-built buildings were designed by the architect Basil Champneys and officially opened by Queen Mary in 1913. The buildings continued to be extended and rebuilt throughout the 70 years that the college spent at Regent&#x27;s Park, especially after extensive damage from wartime bombing.

The college colours were green and grey, said to be those of Minerva. Purple was added in 1938 to represent the university; the resulting colours were, by chance or design, similar to those of women&#x27;s suffrage in the United Kingdom.

A permanent record of the pictorial history of the college was made following the final reunion of former students and the collection and cataloguing of the archives in 1985.

Bedford firsts include:
*First women to run a British institution.
*First Social Sciences department in the UK, established 1918
*First woman to hold a chair in philosophy in the UK, Susan Stebbing.
*One of the first two women fellows of the Royal Society
*Fourth woman chairman of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Marie Patterson
*The first art school in England where women could draw from life

After a brief period of admitting a small number of male postgraduate students, the college became fully coeducational when 47 men passed through clearing in 1965, and the name reverted to Bedford College.

In the early 1980s, Bedford College had approximately 1,700 students and 200 academic staff based in 20 departments.

===Merger with Royal Holloway===
In 1985, Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College, another college of the University of London which, like Bedford College, had been a college only for women when first founded. The merged institution took Royal Holloway College&#x27;s premises in Egham, Surrey, just outside London, as its main campus and took on the name of Royal Holloway and Bedford New College (RHBNC). The decision to drop the Bedford name from day-to-day use caused some discontent among graduates of Bedford College, who felt that their old college had now essentially been taken over by Royal Holloway, and that Bedford College&#x27;s name and history as a pioneering institution in the field of women&#x27;s education were being forgotten. To give more prominence to the Bedford name, the merged college named a large, newly built library in the centre of its campus the &quot;Bedford Library&quot;. Relations between RHUL and some of the Bedford College alumni remain somewhat strained, but many other Bedford College alumni maintain links with RHUL, supporting alumni events and other college work.

Bedford College&#x27;s old premises in Regent&#x27;s Park is now the home of Regent&#x27;s University London.

<text>The British Empire Exhibition was a colonial exhibition held at Wembley Park, London England from 23 April to 1 November 1924 and from 9 May to 31 October 1925.

==Background==
In 1920 the British Government decided to site the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park, on the site of the pleasure gardens created by Edward Watkin in the 1890s. A British Empire Exhibition had first been proposed in 1902, by the British Empire League, and again in 1913. The Russo-Japanese War had prevented the first plan from being developed and World War I put an end to the second, though there had been a Festival of Empire in 1911, held in part at Crystal Palace.

One of the reasons for the suggestion was a sense that other powers were challenging Britain on the world stage. Despite victory in World War I, this was in some ways even truer in 1919. The country had economic problems and its naval supremacy was being challenged by two of its former allies, the USA and Japan. In 1917 Britain had committed itself eventually to leave India, which effectively signalled the end of the British Empires, while the Dominions had shown little interest in following British foreign policy since the war. It was hoped that the Exhibition would strengthen the bonds within the Empire, stimulate trade and demonstrate British greatness both abroad and at home, where the public was believed to be increasingly uninterested in Empire.

Wembley Urban District Council was opposed to the idea, as was &quot;The Times&quot;, which considered Wembley too far from Central London.

A world tour headed by Major Ernest Belcher in 1922 that lasted 10 months was mounted to promote participation in the Exhibition, with Agatha Christie and her husband among the participants.

The British Empire Exhibition ran from April 1924 to April 1925, closing over the winter, and it made Wembley a household name. In 1919 the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) had become the President of the organising committee for the proposed Exhibition at Wembley Park, north-west London, although the closing ceremony was presided over by his brother, the future George VI. The Prince wished for the Exhibition to boast &quot;a great national sports ground&quot; and so exercised some influence on the creation of Wembley Stadium at Wembley Park in 1923.

== Empire Stadium ==
A purpose-built &quot;great national sports ground&quot;, called the Empire Stadium, was built for the Exhibition. This became Wembley Stadium.

The first turf for this stadium was cut on the site of the old tower on 10 January 1922. 250,000 tons of earth were then removed, and the new structure constructed within 10 months, opening well before the rest of the Exhibition was ready. Designed by John William Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton, and built by Sir Robert McAlpine, it could hold 125,000 people, 30,000 of them seated. The building was an unusual mix of Roman imperial and Mughal architecture.

Although it incorporated a football pitch, it was not solely intended as a football stadium. Its quarter mile running track, incorporating a 220 yard straight track (the longest in the country) were seen as being at least equally important.

The only standard gauge locomotive involved in the construction of the Stadium has survived, and still runs on Sir William McAlpine&#x27;s private Fawley Hill railway near Henley.

== Exhibition station ==
Wembley Park station was rebuilt for the British Empire Exhibition and a new station, Exhibition Station (Wembley), was built on a spur to connect the station to Marylebone. Exhibition station opened on 28 April 1923, the day of Wembley Stadium&#x27;s first FA cup final. It was later renamed Wembley Exhibition, and then, in February 1928, Wembley Stadium. It was only really used to transport spectators to Wembley events. It stopped carrying passengers in May 1968 and officially closed on 1 September 1969.

== Design and construction ==
The Exhibition presented a creative challenge, in that its concept required a large number of buildings in a variety of styles. This offered the architects a unique opportunity to experiment. To simplify construction, the main building material used for the Exhibition buildings was reinforced concrete, (then called &quot;ferro-concrete&quot;), selected for its speed of construction. Wembley Park thus earned the title of the first &quot;concrete city&quot; the world had ever seen. Like the stadium, the other exhibition buildings were designed by John William Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton, assisted by engineer Owen Williams. All three had considerable previous experience of using concrete.

Nearly 2,000 men were employed in constructing the Exhibition buildings during 1923-4.

The Indian pavilion had towers and domes, the West African pavilion looked like an Arab fort, the Burmese pavilion was a temple and the South African building reflected the Dutch style.
Aside from the Stadium and major pavilions to house the works of each dominion, colony or group of colonies, there were four other major structures. These were the palaces of Engineering, Industry and Arts, and HM Government Building. All of these palaces can be seen to have had a Roman Imperial character as befitted their political symbolism. At the time, the palaces of Industry and Engineering were world&#x27;s largest reinforced concrete structures.

The exhibition&#x27;s roads were named by Rudyard Kipling.

The site was also served by Britain&#x27;s, and possibly the world&#x27;s, first bus station, which could handle 100,000 passengers a day.

== Opening ceremony ==
The British Empire Exhibition was officially opened by King George V on 23 April 1924—Saint George&#x27;s Day. The opening ceremony was broadcast by BBC Radio, the first such broadcast by a British monarch. The King also sent a telegram that travelled around the world in one minute 20 seconds before being given back to him by a messenger boy.

== Exhibits ==
Much of the Empire went on display at Wembley Park, but it had to be, of necessity, reduced to a &quot;taster-sized&quot; version. Of the 58 territories which composed the Empire at the time, 56 participated with displays and pavilions, the exceptions being The Gambia and Gibraltar. The Irish Free State did not participate either.

The Exhibition&#x27;s official aim was &quot;to stimulate trade, strengthen bonds that bind mother Country to her Sister States and Daughters, to bring into closer contact the one with each other, to enable all who owe allegiance to the British flag to meet on common ground and learn to know each other&quot;. It cost £12 million and was the largest exhibition ever staged anywhere in the world. It attracted 27 million visitors.

Admission cost 1s 6d (p) for adults and 9d (p) for children.

The Palace of Engineering (in 1925 the Palace of Housing &amp; Transport) was the largest exhibition building. It contained a crane capable of moving 25 tons (a practical necessity, not an exhibit) and contained displays on engineering, shipbuilding, electric power, motor vehicles, railways (including locomotives, see below), metallurgy and telegraphs and wireless. In 1925 there seems to have been less emphasis on things that could also be classified as Industry, with instead more on housing and aircraft. The Palace of Industry was slightly smaller. It contained displays on the chemical industry, coal, metals, medicinal drugs, sewage disposal, food, drinks, tobacco, clothing, gramophones, gas and Nobel explosives. Surprisingly the Ulster Pavilion designed by Clough Williams-Ellis was located in the Palace of Industry.

Each colony and dominion was assigned its own distinctive pavilion to reflect local culture and architecture. The Canada Pavilion contained displays on minerals, farming, forestry, the paper industry, water power and Canada as a holiday destination, as well as, in the dairy industry section, a full sized figure of the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, sculpted in butter and preserved in a refrigerated case. This pavilion was also flanked by smaller pavilions dedicated to the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways. 

The Dominion of Newfoundland pavilion was located next to the HM Government building, and featured a bronze caribou, the emblem of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. At the conclusion of the exhibition, the memorial was donated by Major William Howe Greene to the citizens of Newfoundland and displayed in Bowring Park (St. John&#x27;s). 
The Australian Pavilion displayed sheep-shearing and boasted a 16-foot diameter ball of Australian wool. It also featured a butter sculpture, of legendary England cricketer Jack Hobbs being bowled as England succumbed to the Baggy Greens in a Test match.

Rather smaller was the pavilion shared by the West Indies and British Guiana, south of the HM Government Pavilion. Each of the West Indian islands had a court in the pavilion, as did the Falkland Islands.

The Malta pavilion was modelled on a fortress with its front entrance looking like the Mdina Gate, and its rear like one of Birgu&#x27;s gates. It was 3 stories high and had a garden. It was designed by Alberto La Ferla and Joseph Cachia Caruana.

The Palace of Arts, which was fire-proofed, contained historical room sets, as well as painting and sculpture since the eighteenth century. It also displayed Queen Mary&#x27;s Dolls&#x27; House, now at Windsor Castle, which contained miniature bottles of Bass beer.

Kiosks, located both inside and outside the pavilions, represented individual companies within the Empire, encouraging commercial opportunities. One such was the Pear&#x27;s Palace of Beauty (see below). Since the Exhibition was the first major event after the war, many firms produced a glut of commemorative items for sale.

The management of the exhibition asked the Imperial Studies Committee of the Royal Colonial Institute to assist them with the educational aspect of the exhibition, which resulted in a 12-volume book, &quot;The British Empire: A survey&quot;, with Hugh Gunn as the general editor, and which was published in London in 1924.

== Railway exhibits ==
Several railway companies had display stands at the Exhibition; in some cases they exhibited their latest locomotives or coaches. Among the exhibits in the Palace of Engineering was the now famous railway locomotive, LNER 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;; this was joined in 1925 by GWR 4079 &quot;Pendennis Castle&quot;. Several other railway locomotives were exhibited: in 1925, the Southern Railway exhibited no. 866 of their N class, which was brand new, not entering service until 28 November 1925. The 1924 exhibition included a &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; class 4-6-0 locomotive of London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR) design, which had been built for the exhibition by the Scottish manufacturer William Beardmore &amp; Company. Beardmore&#x27;s had previously built similar locomotives for the LNWR, which in 1923 had become a constituent of the newly formed London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS); when the exhibition closed in November 1924, the LMS bought the locomotive from Beardmore. A Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway-designed Baltic Tank 4-6-4T, number 11114, built by the LMS at Horwich Works new, was also on display and featured in postcards.

In 1924, the Metropolitan Railway displayed one of its latest Inner Circle cars, a first class driving trailer which had been built in 1923. In 1925, in the Palace of Housing and Transport, the Metropolitan displayed electric locomotive no. 15, with some of the panelling, doors and framework removed from one side, to allow the interior to be viewed; it had been built in 1922. A few years later, it was named &quot;Wembley 1924&quot; in honour of the exhibition. Ernest Baguley exhibited their narrow-gauge locomotive No. 774.

== Pears&#x27; Palace of Beauty ==
The exhibition grounds contained commercial kiosks, run by newspapers, cigarette companies and other businesses. All these structures were designed by the architect Joseph Emberton and his team.

One of the largest kiosks was the Pears&#x27; Palace of Beauty, selling souvenir soaps. It was located in the amusement park. The Palace of Beauty was white with two curved staircases leading up to a domed gazebo supported by columns. It was also an exhibition space containing 10 soundproofed, glass-fronted rooms, each containing an actress/model dressed as a beautiful woman from history, with accompanying reproduction furniture. The ten beauties were Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, Scheherazade, Dante&#x27;s Beatrice, Elizabeth Woodville, Mary Queen of Scots, Nell Gwyn, Madame de Pompadour, the actress Sarah Siddons and &#x27;Miss 1924&#x27;. There were also two soap-related characters, Bubbles and The Spirit of Purity.

The Palace, which charged admission, was open 13 hours a day, so each beauty was depicted by two actresses/models working shifts. 14 of the performers were depicted on souvenir postcards. Nearly 750,000 people visited the Palace.

== Other attractions ==
In addition to the pavilions and kiosks there was a lake, a funfair, a garden and a working replica coal mine. There were also numerous restaurants, the most expensive of which was the Lucullus restaurant (in 1925 the Wembley Garden Club restaurant) near the exhibition gardens. In 1924 J. Lyons held a monopoly of catering, but the restaurant in the Indian Pavilion used Indian cooks and was advised by Edward Palmer &quot;of Messrs. Veeraswami &quot;[sic]&quot; &amp; Co.&quot; to serve as &quot;Indian Adviser at the restaurant.&quot; In 1925 Veeraswamy &amp; Co ran the Indian restaurant, despite the fact that, for reasons both economic and political, the Indian Government did not take part in the 1925 season. Veeraswamy &amp; Co later founded the first Indian restaurant aimed at a non-Anglo-Indian white clientele in England.

After admission, most of the attractions in the grounds were free. They could also be explored after dark. The various buildings of the site were linked by two &#x27;light railways&#x27; of unusual construction, the screw-propelled &quot;Never-Stop Railway&quot;. and the &#x27;Roadrails&#x27; line on which trains were hauled by steam or petrol tractors guided by the rails but with driving wheels running on the ground outside the track. Visitors could also travel in electric &quot;Railodok&quot; buses (little more than basic railway station luggage trolleys fitted with open-sided bodywork, but exciting nonetheless).

== Events ==
The Stadium itself was used extensively for performances by massed bands and choirs, military and historical displays, an Edinburgh-like tattoo, fireworks, the first Rugby Union match to be played at Wembley, a simulation of an air attack on London (London Defended, see below) and a genuine rodeo which caused some alarm to animal lovers. A highlight was the elaborate &quot;Pageant of Empire&quot; organised by pageant master Frank Lascelles. This involved thousands of actors and was held in the Empire Stadium from 21 July 1924. The newly appointed Master of the King&#x27;s Musick, Sir Edward Elgar, composed an &quot;Empire March&quot; for it and the music for a series of songs with words by Alfred Noyes.

In August 1924, an Imperial Jamboree was held at Wembley, attended by 13,000 Boy Scouts from many parts of the empire, the largest Scout camp held anywhere at that time. The event included a series of public displays inside the stadium.

==London Defended==

From 9 May to 1 June 1925, No. 32 Squadron RAF flew an air display six nights a week entitled &quot;London Defended&quot;. Similar to the display they had done the previous year, when the aircraft were painted black, it consisted of a night time air display over the Wembley Exhibition flying RAF Sopwith Snipes which were painted red for the display and fitted with white lights on the wings, tail and fuselage. The display involved firing blank ammunition into the stadium crowds and dropping pyrotechnics from the aeroplanes to simulate shrapnel from guns on the ground, Explosions on the ground also produced the effect of bombs being dropped into the stadium by the Aeroplanes. One of the Pilots in the display was Flying officer C. W. A. Scott who later became famous for breaking three England-Australia solo flight records and winning the MacRobertson Air Race with co-pilot Tom Campbell Black in 1934.

== Philately and numismatics ==

The Exhibition is of philatelic interest, as it was the first occasion for which the British Post Office issued commemorative postage stamps. Two stamps were issued on 23 April 1924: a 1d in scarlet, and a d in brown, both being inscribed &quot;British Empire Exhibition 1924&quot;; they were designed by H. Nelson. A second printing, identical to the first apart from the year being changed to 1925, was issued on 9 May 1925. A List of Great Britain commemorative stamps gives further details of British commemorative postage stamps. Envelopes, letter cards, postcards and many other souvenirs commemorating the event were produced as well.

A significant number of medals were struck for the Exhibition, both by the organisers and by commercial organisations.

== Commercial outcome ==
Despite providing a wealth of entertainment, the Exhibition was not a financial success. Despite 18 million visitors in 1924, the project ended that season without breaking even. In an attempt to raise enough money, the late decision was taken to reopen, with some variations, in 1925, but the Exhibition did not do as well in its second season. It closed for good on 31 October 1925, having received 27 million visitors in two years. The final cost reached in excess of £6 million. &quot;Variety&quot; claimed that it was the world&#x27;s biggest outdoor failure, costing the UK Government $90 million (over £20 million based on the exchange rates at the time).

Two of the most popular attractions were US dodgem cars and a copy of the tomb of Tutankhamen. Both of these were in the funfair, with the tomb there because the Kingdom of Egypt was no longer a British Protectorate, having been officially independent since 1922 (although in practice still in the British sphere of influence). Other popular attractions included the Queen&#x27;s Dolls House, the Wild West Rodeo, the dance pavilions, and the amusement park, but had very little to do with the empire as a whole. P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s fictional Bertie Wooster may have reflected genuine reactions to the Exhibition in preferring the Green Swizzles at the Planters Bar to anything more didactic.

== Survival of stadium ==
Most of the exhibition halls were intended to be temporary and demolished afterwards, but, partly because of the high cost of demolishing such huge concrete structures, the Palace of Engineering and the British Government Pavilion survived more-or-less intact beyond the 1970s until finally being demolished in late 1982. However, the Palace of Industry and the sacred art section of the Palace of Arts survived until the 2010s. At the suggestion of the chair of the exhibition committee, Scotsman Sir James Stevenson, and thanks to the intervention of Arthur Elvin, who had been contracted to clear the exhibition site, the Empire Stadium was retained. It became Wembley Stadium, the home of Football in England until 2003, when it was demolished to be replaced by a new stadium.

== Influence on development of Wembley ==
The British Empire Exhibition inevitably led to increased suburban development. An outfall sewer was built to serve the Exhibition and a number of roads in the area were straightened and widened, and new road signs installed. In addition, new bus services were introduced to serve the Exhibition. Visitors to the Exhibition were introduced to Wembley and some were later encouraged to move to the area when houses had been built to accommodate them. Conversely, though the Exhibition encouraged the development of Wembley as a typical inter-war suburb, the survival of the Stadium ensured that the Empire Exhibition grounds in Wembley Park would remain a major London visitor destination.

==Reception==
While the Exhibition incurred substantial financial losses, this should not be interpreted as the Exhibition being a failure in terms of raw attendance. 18 million visitors attended in 1924 and 9 million attended in 1925: a substantial slice of the population of Great Britain in the era even accounting for repeat visitors. The exhibition also garnered huge coverage in the press, with over 2,000 articles in &quot;The Times of London&quot; about the event from 1923 to 1925. Over 6 million listeners tuned in to the radio broadcast of King George V speech at the opening ceremony. Middlebrow British culture continued to be receptive to the brand of imperial pride the Exhibition sought to incubate.

That said, patience with such direct celebration of the British Empire was wearing thin among parts of the intelligentsia of the period, who were less impressed. Edward Elgar, who conducted some of his songs at the opening ceremony, remarked that the pomp and self-importance was &quot;vulgar&quot; and overdone. Virginia Woolf visited the Exhibition but was unimpressed; she called it &quot;an outmoded piece of antiquated fiction.&quot; &quot;Punch&quot; magazine lampooned the exhibit, the left-leaning &quot;New Statesman&quot; mostly ignored it, and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; condemned it, writing &quot;to this debased spirit we owe many unnecessary wars, the loss of much valuable blood.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The Exhibition is a key location in the P. G. Wodehouse short story, &quot;The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy&quot;, in which Sir Roderick Glossop describes it as &quot;the most supremely absorbing and educational collection of objects, both animate and inanimate, gathered from the four corners of the Empire, that has ever been assembled in England&#x27;s history.&quot; Bertie Wooster is somewhat less impressed, remarking that &quot;millions of people, no doubt, are so constituted that they scream with joy and excitement at the spectacle of a stuffed porcupine-fish or a glass jar of seeds from Western Australia – but not Bertram&quot; and sneaks off to the Planters&#x27; Bar in the West Indian section for a Green Swizzle.

The British Empire Exhibition features in David Lean&#x27;s 1944 film &quot;This Happy Breed&quot;, starring Celia Johnson.

In Sir John Betjeman&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Metro-Land&quot; (1973) the poet recalls his childhood experience of the exhibition in the &quot;Wembley&quot; segment.

In Charlie Higson&#x27;s Young Bond novel &quot;SilverFin&quot; (Puffin, 2005), the young James Bond is impressed by the height of the rollercoaster at the British Empire Exhibition in 1925.

The Exhibition features in the opening scene of the 2010 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;. The film is based on the future George VI&#x27;s relationship with speech therapist Lionel Logue following his speech at the Exhibition on 31 October 1925, which proved to be highly embarrassing due to his pronounced stammer.

The popular British TV drama series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; featured a storyline in which the members of the Crawley family and their servants jointly listen to the radio for the very first time, and hear an address by the King at the British Empire Exhibition.

<text>Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. is the company known for publishing the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the world&#x27;s oldest continuously published encyclopaedia. The company also owns the American dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster. Originally founded in Edinburgh, Scotland and historically British, the company is now based in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States.

==History==
===Founding years===

The company was founded in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the 18th century, during the historical period termed the Scottish Enlightenment. Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell began the first edition in 1768. The pair engaged William Smellie, who produced most of the articles in the first edition. The second edition was published in 1784. After Macfarquhar&#x27;s death in 1793, Bell became its sole proprietor and published the third and fourth editions.

Archibald Constable, an Edinburgh publisher, published the fifth and sixth editions. When Constable died in 1827, A &amp; C Black Ltd. bought the copyrights to the encyclopædia at auction, and they published it for the next 70 years.

Beginning with the ninth edition in 1875, the range of topics were expanded by bringing in contributors from the literary field, social sciences and the scientific community. The ninth edition has since been acknowledged as one of the most impressive collections of scholarship ever produced.

In 1901, Horace E. Hooper and Walter M. Jackson purchased all copyrights to the encyclopædia. Hooper and Jackson formed companies in both the United States and England. Hugh Chisholm became the editor for the tenth, eleventh and twelfth editions.
===Sears Roebuck ownership===

In 1915, Sears agreed to market a new and less expensive version of the eleventh edition for middle-class buyers. In 1920, Sears bought Britannica outright, and after only three years of operation, Sears reported a loss of $1.8 million. In 1923, they sold the company back to the widow of Hooper (who had died in 1922) and her brother William Cox. They published the twelfth and thirteenth editions in 1922 and 1926. After Cox failed to raise the money needed to publish the fourteenth edition, Sears ended up financing it, and resumed ownership of Britannica in 1928.

In 1932, Sears restructured Britannica, ending sales through their outlets, opting instead for a network of sales representatives who went door-to-door, and staffing booths at conventions and shopping centres. In 1938, Britannica began publishing a yearly synopsis of world events, called the &quot;Britannica Book of the Year&quot;.

===Benton family ownership===
In 1941, Britannica was given to the University of Chicago by Sears. However, the university did not believe they could manage the company. William Benton, then vice president of the university, offered to put up the operating capital to protect the university against any losses. Benton bought two‐thirds of the stock, and subsequently bought the remaining third. In 1952, Benton started preparations for the fifteenth edition. Britannica acquired Merriam-Webster in 1964 and Compton&#x27;s Encyclopedia as well in the early 1960s.

Benton died in 1973, before the fifteenth edition was published in 1974. The newly titled &quot;Britannica 3&quot; was composed of a ten-volume Micropædia, a 19-volume Macropædia and a one-volume guide to the encyclopædia&#x27;s use, called Propædia. In 1985, a two-volume index was added, as well as other refinements. Robert P. Gwinn succeeded Benton as publisher and chairman of Britannica in 1974. He divided the company&#x27;s operations into Britannica USA and Britannica International. In 1990, nearly 120,000 encyclopædias were sold in the United States, with sales for the year rising to $650 million. By 1994, sales had slumped to $453 million, with only 51,000 sets being sold in the US. Sales continued to decline after 1994, finally forcing the company to close more than 70 per cent of its sales offices.

===Safra ownership===

In 1996, Britannica was sold to an investment group led by Jacob E. Safra, a Switzerland-based financier. He restructured the company, laying off more than 120 people including many of the company&#x27;s top employees. Safra also dissolved the home sales force, with an additional 140 losing their jobs, along with 300 independent contractors. In 1999, they launched Britannica.com, which contained the complete Encyclopædia Britannica. Britannica.com laid off 20 per cent of its work force one year later.

In 2009, Britannica Global Edition was printed with 30 volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles and 8,500 photographs. In 2012, after 244 years, Britannica ended the print editions, with the 32 volumes of the 2010 installment being the last on paper; future editions have been published exclusively online since. In 2018, the company released Britannica Insights, an extension for the Chrome web browser. The extension supplements Google&#x27;s featured snippets. In 2019, in a partnership with Binumi, Britannica released a video product that gives schools the opportunity to use millions of royalty-free multimedia clips to create digital storytelling projects about content they are already teaching.

In 2020, Encyclopædia Britannica released the &quot;Britannica All New Children&#x27;s Encyclopedia: What We Know and What We Don&#x27;t&quot;, an encyclopedia aimed primarily at younger readers, covering major topics. The encyclopedia was widely praised for bringing back the print format. It was &quot;Britannica&quot;&#x27;s first encyclopedia for children since 1984. ProCon.org was acquired by Encyclopædia Britannica in 2020.

Creighton inducted Kamler into the school&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Professional==
In 1994, Kamler left Creighton and signed with the expansion St. Louis Knights in the USISL. In 1995, he moved to the Richmond Kickers, which won the league and 1995 U.S. Open Cup titles. In February 1996, D.C. United selected Kamler in the 6th round of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. He played three and a half seasons with DC before being shipped to the Miami Fusion in 1999. Kamler was sent back to DC United (in exchange for Carlos Llamosa) before the 2001 season, and spent a year there before being shipped to the MetroStars for Richie Williams. His stay with the Metros did not last long: midway through the year, Kamler was part of a massive six-player deal in which he wound up with the New England Revolution. After two and a half seasons with the Revs, it was time once again to pack his bag, as he was chosen by Real Salt Lake with the eighth overall pick of the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft. In ten years in MLS, Kamler scored 12 league goals with 27 assists; half of his goals came in the 2003 season for the Revs. He retired following the 2005 season.

He was named MLS Humanitarian of the Year in 2005.

In October 2018, Kamler was named head coach of USL League Two expansion club Green Bay Voyageurs.

Kamler has also been the head coach of the West De Pere Phantoms boys soccer team.

==Personal==
Kamler was involved in an altercation with Jake Dancy during a February 1997 preseason match. Kamler&#x27;s face was broken in seven places, including his cheek and around his left eye. Kamler filed a lawsuit against Dancy and the U.S. Soccer Federation. Dancy was charged with a felony for assault by the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office. A trial was held on May 18, 1998, and Dancy pleaded no contest to the charge. Dancy was sentenced five years probation.

<text>Two postage stamps were issued to commemorate the British Empire Exhibition, a colonial exhibition held in Wembley Park, Wembley, in 1924. Two denominations, a 1d scarlet and 1½d brown, were produced. When the Exhibition reopened in 1925, they were re-issued with the same design, but the dates were changed to read &quot;1925&quot; instead of &quot;1924&quot;.
The stamps were printed in sheets of 120 which consisted of two panes of 60 (10 rows of 6). These panes were separated prior to issue to the post office making a post office sheet.

Two types of perforation exist across both issues, both of which are gauge 14. Initially the perforations were created by a line machine, producing small holes. This was later changed to a comb machine, producing larger holes.

<text>Oscar Adolf Wisting (6 June 1871 – 5 December 1936) was a Norwegian Naval officer and polar explorer. Together with Roald Amundsen he was the first person to reach both the North and South Poles.

== Biography ==

Oscar Wisting was born in Larvik, in Vestfold county, Norway. He was the son of Ola Martin Olsen Wisting (1843–1927) and Abigael Helene Andersen (1843–85). He became the eldest of 13 children. His father ran a trucking business. At the age of sixteen, he went to sea and in 1892 joined the Royal Norwegian Navy.

He was working as a naval gunner at Karljohansvern, the naval base in Horten during 1909 when Roald Amundsen asked him to go north with him on his forthcoming North Pole expedition. Amundsen later secretly changed his plans. Wisting went to sea believing they were heading for the North Pole. Instead he learned that they were going south to pick up the race with Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole.

As a participant in Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition, on 14 December 1911 along with Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Olav Bjaaland and Sverre Hassel, Wisting planted the Norwegian flag on the Geographic South Pole, the first explorers to have reached that point. From 1918 to 1925 Wisting was chief officer on board the &quot;Maud&quot; in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s attempt to traverse the Northeast passage. From 1923 to 1925 Wisting more or less acted as leader of the expedition after Amundsen left to try to fly to the pole instead.

In 1926 Wisting participated in Amundsen&#x27;s successful attempt to fly over the North Pole. In the airship &quot;Norge&quot; they reached the pole on 12 May 1926. The three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole—by Frederick Cook in 1908, Robert Peary in 1909, and Richard E. Byrd in 1926 —are all disputed, as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraud. Some of those disputing these earlier claims therefore consider the crew of the &quot;Norge&quot; to be the first verified explorers to have reached the North Pole. In addition Wisting, along with Amundsen, was one of the two first persons who had been to both the North Pole and the South Pole.

In later years Oscar Wisting was an active force behind the preparations and building of the Fram Museum in Oslo, a museum built to store and display the polar ship &quot;Fram&quot;. On 5 December 1936 Wisting was found dead from heart attack in his old bunk on board the &quot;Fram&quot;, a few days before the 25th anniversary of the successful South Pole expedition.

For his participation in the expedition, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (&quot;Sydpolsmedaljen&quot;), the Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition.

== Sources ==

Oscar Wisting wrote about his experiences with Roald Amundsen in &quot;16 år med Roald Amundsen&quot; (Oslo: Glydendal Norsk Forlag, 1930). Roald Amundsen wrote about the expedition in &quot;Sydpolen&quot; published in two volumes in 1912–1913. The work was translated into English by A. G. Chater, and published as &quot;The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the &quot;Fram&quot; 1910–1912&quot;.

== Legacy ==
* Mount Wisting – the northwesternmost summit of the massif at the head of Amundsen Glacier in the Queen Maud Mountains.
* Wisting was portrayed by Ivar Nørve in the 1985 television serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;, and by Ole Andre Kaada in the 2019 film &quot;Amundsen&quot;.

<text>Le Grand Meaulnes () is the only novel by French author Alain-Fournier, who was killed in the first month of World War I. The novel, published in 1913, a year before the author&#x27;s death, is somewhat autobiographical, especially the name of the heroine Yvonne, for whom he had a doomed infatuation in Paris. Fifteen-year-old François Seurel narrates the story of his friendship with seventeen-year-old Augustin Meaulnes as the latter searches for his lost love. Impulsive, reckless and heroic, Meaulnes embodies the romantic ideal, the search for the unobtainable, and the mysterious world between childhood and adulthood.

==Title==
The title is French for &quot;The Great Meaulnes&quot;. The difficulties in translating the French (meaning big, tall, great, etc.) and &quot;le domaine perdu&quot; (&quot;lost estate/domain/demesne&quot;) have led to a variety of English titles, including &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;The Lost Domain&quot;, &quot;Meaulnes: The Lost Domain, The Wanderer or The End of Youth&quot;, &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes: The Land of the Lost Contentment&quot;, &quot;The Lost Estate (Le Grand Meaulnes)&quot; and &quot;Big Meaulnes (Le Grand Meaulnes)&quot;.

&quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; inspired the title of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Despite this similarity, French translators of Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel struggled in the same way to render the word &quot;great&quot; and chose &quot;Gatsby le magnifique&quot; (literally &quot;Gatsby the Magnificent&quot;).

==Plot summary==
François Seurel, the 15-year-old narrator of the book, is the son of M. Seurel, who is the director of the mixed-ages school in a small village in the Sologne, a region of lakes and sandy forests in the heartland of France. François is intrigued when 17-year-old Augustin Meaulnes, a bright young man from a modest background, arrives at the school. Because of his height, Augustin acquires the nickname &quot;grand&quot; (&quot;tall&quot;). He becomes a hero figure to the class and runs away one evening on an escapade where, after getting lost, he chances on a magical costume party where he is enchanted by the girl of his dreams, Yvonne de Galais, a character inspired by the real-life Yvonne de Quièvrecourt. She lives with her widowed father and her somewhat odd brother Frantz in a vast and ancient family château, Les Sablonnières, which has seen better days. The party was being held to welcome Frantz and the girl he was to marry, Valentine. However, when she does not appear, Frantz attempts suicide but fails.

After returning to school, Meaulnes has only one idea: to again find the mysterious château and the girl with whom he has now fallen in love. However, his local searches fail while at the same time a bizarre young man shows up at the school. It is Frantz de Galais under a different name, trying to escape the pain of having been rejected. Frantz, Meaulnes, and François become friends, and Frantz gives Meaulnes the address of a house in Paris where he says Meaulnes will find his sister, Yvonne de Galais. Meaulnes leaves for Paris only to learn no one lives in the house anymore. He writes to his friend François: &quot;...it is better to forget me. It would be better to forget everything&quot;.

François, who has now become a school teacher like his father, finally manages to find Yvonne de Galais and reunites her with Meaulnes. Yvonne still lives with her aging father in what is left of les Sablonnières, which is closer than the two young friends had first imagined in earlier years. Yvonne is still single and confesses to Meaulnes that he is and has always been the love of her life. She accepts, with her father&#x27;s blessings, Meaulnes&#x27; marriage proposal. However, the restless Meaulnes leaves Yvonne the day after their wedding in order to find her lost brother Frantz (whom he had once promised to help) and re-unite him with his fiancée, Valentine. Yvonne remains at the château, where she gives birth to a little girl but dies two days later. 

Eventually François lives in the house Meaulnes and Yvonne lived in and raises the little girl there, while waiting for the return of his friend Meaulnes. While looking through old papers, François discovers a handwritten diary by Meaulnes. During the years in Paris (before François brought Meaulnes and Yvonne back together), Meaulnes had met and romanced Valentine, the fiancée who had jilted Frantz on the night of the party.

Meaulnes does return, after a year and eight months, having brought Frantz and Valentine back together. He discovers that Yvonne has died and left a daughter, whom he claims. Four years have elapsed since the beginning of the story.

==Inspiration==
François Seurel’s childhood is based on Alain-Fournier’s own childhood in the country, where his parents were the school teachers. François’ personality also mirrors his own at that age, as he was more obedient and quiet than he grew up to be. 

Everything about Augustin Meaulnes is based on Alain-Fournier himself from his teenage years: his personality, his hopes and dreams and his idealistic quest. 

Yvonne De Galais is based on Yvonne de Quièvrecourt, the girl he met, fell in love with and lost track of when he was 19, and who remained the love of his life. Augustin and Yvonne’s first encounter tells almost exactly the tale of their own. Augustin’s quest to find her again mirrors Alain-Fournier’s in Paris from 1905 to 1907, except that his Yvonne was actually married when he found that out. 

Frantz De Galais is also Alain-Fournier’s alter ego, reflecting his evolving identity emerging after his own heartbreak: his refusal to fit in the confinement of adulthood, his thirst for freedom and imagination and his hypersensitivity making him be seen as emotionally unstable by regular people. 

The character of Valentine and her relationship with Meaulnes is based on Jeanne Bruneau, Alain-Fournier’s sweetheart from 1910 to 1912 and their romance. Like Meaulnes, he felt like he still belonged to Yvonne, but he was also scared of what would become of Jeanne if he didn’t watch over her, and he was reproaching her for not believing enough.

==Adaptations==

&quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; was featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot;, recorded in 1980 and repeated in 1999. A two-part serialisation by Jennifer Howarth was broadcast as the &quot;Classic Serial&quot; in August 2005.

The book was made into a film by Jean-Gabriel Albicocco in 1967. Another film adaptation, &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot;, was released in November 2006, starring Jean-Baptiste Maunier, Clémence Poésy, and Nicolas Duvauchelle.

&quot;Meaulnes the Great&quot; is the title of a 2014 bas-relief (130 cm x 140 cm) carved in limewood by the French artist Jean-Louis Berthod from Albens, Savoy. The relief was inspired by Alain-Fournier&#x27;s book and is a tribute to the missing people of World War I.

The book is the inspiration for the song &#x27;My Yvonne&#x27;, the ninth track from UK singer-songwriter Jack Peñate&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Matinée&quot;, featuring backing vocals from a then-unknown Adele. Adele is not credited as a featured artist on the song; however, she is credited as a backing vocalist in the album&#x27;s booklet.

==Appearances in other works==
&quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; is referenced multiple times in Simone de Beauvoir’s &quot;Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter.&quot; 

It is the only book that Sal Paradise carries with him on his travels in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;Living to Tell the Tale&quot;, Gabriel García Márquez remembers a crewmate from his youth who was an insatiable reader and who owned a copy of &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot;, which became one of the author&#x27;s preferred literary masterpieces.

<text>Kessenich () is a village in the Belgian province Limburg. It is a section of the municipality of Kinrooi, lying in the eastern end of the municipality.

==Geography==
Kessenich is the end of the &quot;Grensmaas&quot;, the part of the Meuse who forms a natural border with the Dutch province Limburg. This river separates Kessenich from Stevensweert. In the north lie the Dutch villages of Thorn, Ittervoort and Neeritter. In the south lies Maaseik. The region of Kessenich is dissected by several rivers: the Abeek, the Itterbeek and Witbeek on their way to the Meuse.

East of Kessenich is an area with several ponds, the &quot;Maasplassen&quot;. They were created by large-scale exploitation of gravel from 1949. The gravel layer with a thickness of up to 10 m, was deposited by the Meuse, which repeatedly moved to the east. In May 2008 ended the gravel mining and began the partial attenuation of the lakes. Now, some Maasplassen are equipped for recreation or nature.

==Name==
Its name is derived from the Gallo-Roman &quot;Cassiniacum&quot;. Kessenich is also named as &quot;Kesnic&quot; (1102), &quot;Kasnech&quot; (1132), &quot;Casselin&quot; or &quot;Cassenic&quot; (1155), &quot;Kessenich&quot; (1219) and &quot;Cessenic&quot; (1224). Later, it&#x27;s also identified on maps as Kessingen (1573) and Kesnick (1754). In Limburgish it&#x27;s still called &#x27;Kesing&#x27;.

==History==
Kessenich is the oldest of the five villages of Kinrooi. It was founded as a Celtic settlement close to the Meuse. The Meuse has since shifted to the east, leaving a bogged arm to north of the village. This marsh, the &quot;Vijverbroek&quot;, was used in the Middle Ages to create a redoubt. According to a legend there was a village called ‘’Vijvere’’ between Kessenich and Thorn that was drowned. Now it is a unique area overgrown with alder and other tree and plant species.

Remains of a prehistoric settlement have been found on the &quot;Boterakker&quot;, south of the village. Other prehistoric remains have been found on the &quot;Hezerheide&quot;, west of the village. Roman catacombs (&quot;Molenwegske&quot;) and a 12 meter wide Roman road connecting Maastricht and Nijmegen have also been found.
After the fallof the Western Roman Empire, a shire covering Kessenich, Thorn, Aldeneik and some other villages came into existence. Ansfried of Utrecht might have been the last count of this area, because in that period the shire suddenly fall apart. Finally, the area was divided into three parts: Thorn, Aldeneik, and Kessenich. Thorn and Aldeneik became important abbeys, Kessenich was lying between both. So there was a major influence of those abbeys. Kessenich became an imperial free city, since the 14th century united with the county Bronshorn (Hunsel).
The county of Kessenich was governed out of a Motte-and-bailey, built as protection against the pillaging Vikings, who even Maastricht, Tongeren and Aachen have reached via the Meuse, and the many floods of the Meuse. From the tower on the 10 meters high artificial hill are ruins remaining. The new castle has been built in the 17th century, by the family Van Waes. The hamlet where the castle is, lies nearby Neeritter, so it&#x27;s called &quot;Borgitter&quot;. 
In the 18th century was Kessenich like whole Limburg the battlefield of the various wars. When the Dutch-British troops withdrew from the region under the leadership of the Duke of Malborough during the Spanish Succession War, Kessenich was plundered in 1714, besieged the castle and the countess captured. In the whole region it is still the annual tradition to burn a straw doll, which the Duke of Marlborough should propose.

In 1795, the French annexed also Kessenich and divided it into the department Meuse-Inférieure. The estates of the counts Van Waes were sold by the Frenchmen to the family Michiels. One of their descendants was Willem Michiels of Kessenich, who was mayor of Maastricht from 1937 till 1967. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat with the Battle of Waterloo, all countries of the Benelux were united into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the department became the Province of Limburg. The anthem of this province is written in Neeritter. In 1839, the province is divided with de Meuse as limit into a Belgian and a Dutch part.

<text>Joseph Anthony DiGiamarino (born April 6, 1977, in Corona, California) is an American soccer player who last played left defense for the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer.

DiGiamarino, nicknamed &quot;DiGi&quot;, attended Corona High School where he was the 1995 California High School Player of the Year. He played college soccer at Fullerton State, but left it after his sophomore season, becoming one of the early Project-40 signings in MLS history. He was allocated to the Rapids in 1997, but did not see any time with the team that year, instead playing on loan with the Colorado Foxes of the A-League. That year, he also played for the U.S. U-20 national team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. He played four games as the U.S. went to the Round of 16.

DiGiamarino became a regular with the Rapids in 1998 and played there for three seasons, mostly at left midfield. In 2000, he played for the United States in the Summer Olympics. He left MLS after the year, signing with the Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen.

But various injuries and the quality of the Leverkusen squad led to Joey not seeing any playing time in Germany. After two years in career wasteland, he came back to MLS, signing with the MetroStars in 2003. DiGiamarino was waived by them early in 2004, and was picked up by his original team, Colorado. But the Rapids let him go after the year. In five years in the league, DiGiamarino scored seven goals and added eight assists.

<text>Spooky Tooth was a rock band originally formed in Carlisle, England in 1967. The band was principally active between 1967 and 1974, and re-formed several times in later years.

==History==
Prior to Spooky Tooth, four of the band&#x27;s five founding members had performed in the band Art (formerly known as the V.I.P.&#x27;s). Following the dissolution of Art, the members of that band&#x27;s final line-up (guitarist Luther Grosvenor, vocalist Mike Harrison, drummer Mike Kellie and bassist Greg Ridley) joined forces with American keyboardist/vocalist Gary Wright in October 1967 and formed Spooky Tooth. Wright was introduced to the members of Art by Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records renowned for promoting Progressive Rock, Roots Reggae and dub music.

Their debut, &quot;It&#x27;s All About&quot;, was released in June 1968 on Island Records and was produced by Jimmy Miller, who was also behind the boards for Spencer Davis Group, Motörhead, Traffic, the Rolling Stones and Blind Faith.

The second album, &quot;Spooky Two&quot; (March 1969), also produced by Miller, gained some attention in the rock press but, like the debut, failed to sell. It was the last album release by the original lineup and included their now classic version of the Larry Weiss penned &quot;Evil Woman&quot; and &quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot;, which was covered by Judas Priest on their release &quot;Stained Class&quot; (1978).

Ridley joined Humble Pie in 1969 and was replaced by Andy Leigh for the album &quot;Ceremony&quot; (December 1969).
The experimental nature of &quot;Ceremony&quot; received mixed reviews and despite the project being instigated by Gary Wright, the album is considered by him to have ended the band&#x27;s career. The record is described by another as being &quot;one of the great screw-ups in rock history&quot;. As Wright describes it, &quot;...We did a project that wasn&#x27;t our album. It was with this French electronic music composer named Pierre Henry. We just told the label, &#x27;You know this is his album, not our album. We&#x27;ll play on it just like musicians.&#x27; And then when the album was finished, they said, &#x27;Oh no no — it&#x27;s great. We&#x27;re gonna release this as your next album.&#x27; We said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t do that. It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the direction of &quot;Spooky Two&quot; and it will ruin our career.&#x27; And that&#x27;s exactly what happened.&quot;

Wright left the band following the release of the album. Harrison, Grosvenor and Kellie remained and recorded &quot;The Last Puff&quot; (July 1970) with members of Joe Cocker&#x27;s Grease Band (guitarist Henry McCullough, keyboardist Chris Stainton and bassist Alan Spenner).

In the autumn of 1970 the band embarked on a European tour that was undertaken with a line-up of Harrison, Grosvenor, Kellie, keyboardist John Hawken (ex-Nashville Teens) and bassist Steve Thompson. After this, the group disbanded, though Harrison and Wright reformed Spooky Tooth in September 1972 with a different line-up.

&quot;You Broke My Heart So I Busted Your Jaw&quot; was the first album by the reunited band, released in May 1973 on Island Records. Founding guitarist Grosvenor did not rejoin the band, as he had teamed up with Mott the Hoople, adopting the stage name of Ariel Bender. Grosvenor was succeeded by Mick Jones, while founding drummer Kellie was replaced by Bryson Graham. The bassist was Ian Herbert, then Chris Stewart.

For their next album, &quot;Witness&quot; (November 1973), original drummer Mike Kellie returned in place of Graham. Wright remained the dominant songwriter at this stage of the band&#x27;s history. But co-lead singer Harrison left following the album&#x27;s release and Mike Patto was the new vocalist, alongside Wright, when they recorded &quot;The Mirror&quot; (October 1974), which also included new bass player Val Burke and Bryson Graham back on drums. But the album&#x27;s failure led to Wright leaving once again for a solo career and the group disbanding in November 1974.

Jon Milward summarized the band in &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; in 1979: &quot;If ever there was a heavy band, Spooky Tooth had to be it. Featuring two vocalists prone to blues-wrenching extremes, and an instrumental attack comprising awesomely loud keyboards and guitars, Spooky Tooth came on like an overwhelming vat of premedicated goo.&quot; Noting their lack of commercial success, Milward concluded that the group &quot;would remain the right band at the wrong time.&quot;

==After Spooky Tooth ==
Mick Jones went on to form Foreigner in 1976.
Grosvenor later played with Stealers Wheel and joined Mott the Hoople in the 1970s (replacing Mick Ralphs who left to form Bad Company), adopting the name Ariel Bender. In 2005, he founded the Ariel Bender Band, with which he still occasionally performs. In 2018 and 2019, he toured with a reformed Mott the Hoople.

Kellie later joined the Only Ones in the late 1970s also performing with them in 1980s. The band reformed in 2007.

Ridley became a member of Humble Pie. On 19 November 2003 he died in Alicante, Spain, of pneumonia and resulting complications. He was 62.

Wright began to develop an international solo career in the 1970s and had a hit with &quot;Dream Weaver&quot;.

Harrison, Grosvenor, Ridley and Kellie reunited as Spooky Tooth at points in 1997 and 1998, which resulted in an album, &quot;Cross Purpose&quot;, released in February 1999.

Harrison played and recorded with the Hamburg Blues Band and appeared on their CD &quot;Touch&quot; (2002).

In June 2004, Harrison, Wright and Kellie were again re-united as Spooky Tooth with Joey Albrecht (guitar) and Michael Becker (bass) for two concerts in Germany, resulting in a DVD &quot;Nomad Poets&quot; (2007).

In 2006, Harrison released his first solo album in over thirty years, &quot;Late Starter&quot;.

In February 2008, the latest incarnation of Spooky Tooth, featuring Harrison, Wright and Kellie, along with guitarist Steve Farris from Mr. Mister and Shem von Schroeck (bass), played a series of European dates. On 29 May 2009, this same lineup (with drummer Tom Brechtlein replacing Kellie) played at Island Records&#x27; 50th Anniversary at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, before touring Germany that June.

In 2012, Mike Kellie started work on a solo album. Kellie died on 18 January 2017 at the age of 69 after a short illness, and Mike Harrison died on 25 March 2018 at the age of 72. 

Wright died on September 4, 2023, at his home in California at the age of 80. In his final years, he had been suffering from both Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia.

<text>The Santa Lucia Range (sæntə luˈsiːə) or Santa Lucia Mountains is a rugged mountain range in coastal Central California, running from Carmel southeast for to the Cuyama River in San Luis Obispo County. The range is never more than from the coast. The range forms the steepest coastal slope in the contiguous United States. Cone Peak at tall and three miles (5 km) from the coast, is the highest peak in proximity to the ocean in the lower 48 United States. The range was a barrier to exploring the coast of central California for early Spanish explorers.

== Geography ==

The Santa Lucia Range is part of the Outer South California Coast Ranges, in the Pacific Coast Ranges System. The coastal side of the range rises directly from the shoreline, with oceanfront ridges rising directly to the crest of the coastal range. The crest of the range is never more than from the coast. Cone Peak is the steepest coastal elevation in the contiguous United States, rising nearly a mile (1,609 m) above sea level, only three miles (5 km) from the Pacific Ocean.

The range&#x27;s northern section runs parallel to the southern section of the Diablo Range, part of the Inner South Coast Ranges, which lies to the east across the Salinas Valley. The range&#x27;s highest summit is Junipero Serra Peak, in Monterey County and the Los Padres National Forest.

===Major peaks===

* Cone Peak, . 
* Ventana Double Cone, .
* Mount Carmel, .

== History and toponymy ==

The first European to document the Santa Lucias was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542 while sailing northward along the coast on a Spanish naval expedition. Cabrillo originally named the southern portion of the range the &quot;Sierras de San Martín&quot;, as he was passing the area on November 11, the feast day for Saint Martin. He named the northern part &quot;Sierras Nevadas&quot; because there was snow on it.

The present name for the range was documented in 1602 by Sebastián Vizcaíno, who had been tasked by the Spanish to complete a detailed chart of the coast. Passing by the range around December 14th, he named the range &quot;Sierra de Santa Lucia&quot; in honor of Saint Lucy of Syracuse, for whom many Christians celebrate the feast of Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day on December 13th.

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, camped on the coast near Ragged Point in present-day San Luis Obispo County on September 13, 1769. The expedition was forced to bypass the inaccessible coast and travel inland through the San Antonio Valley. The rough trail required much improvement by the scouts, and it was September 24 before the party emerged from the mountains at the San Antonio River near today&#x27;s settlement of Jolon. They traveled north through the Salinas Valley before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it their capital.

== Natural history ==

=== Climate ===

Like other Pacific Coast Ranges, the mountains&#x27; close proximity to the Pacific Ocean cause moisture to be deposited on the west-facing slopes, creating a suitable environment for conifers. This creates a rain shadow over Salinas Valley to the east, which is considerably drier. The higher peaks receive some snowfall during the winter.

The climate is classified as &quot;dry summer subtropical&quot;, or Mediterranean. Rainfall varies from throughout the range. Most of the precipitation falls during the winter on the higher mountains in the north. During the summer, fog and low clouds are frequent along the coast up to an elevation of 2–3,000 feet. Surface runoff from rainfall is rapid, and many streams dry up entirely in the summer, except for some perennial streams in the wetter areas in the north.

=== Flora ===

The western slopes of the range facing the Pacific Ocean are moist with growths of coast redwood, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, Pacific madrone and the local endemic species such as Santa Lucia fir &quot;(Abies bracteata)&quot; and Gowen cypress &quot;(Cupressus goveniana var. goveniana)&quot;. The east side is drier, with chaparral and open woods of pine (including Coulter pine and gray pine) and oak woodlands of several &quot;Quercus&quot; species.

The range is the southernmost native location of about 225 plant species including the coast redwood trees and the northernmost home for about 90 species. The southernmost naturally occurring grove of redwoods is found within the Big Sur region in the Southern Redwood Botanical Area, a reserve located in the Little Redwood Gulch watershed adjacent to the Silver Peak Wilderness. It is just north of the Salmon Creek trailhead. The southernmost tree is about from Highway 1 at the approximate coordinates About 57 plants are only found in the Santa Lucia Mountains. This range is the only known habitat of the Vortriede&#x27;s spineflower.

== Geology ==
The rock of the Santa Lucias is dominated by granitic basement of the Salinian Block, between the San Andreas Fault and Sur-Nacimiento Fault. The core of the Salinian block formed as part of the same batholith which forms the core of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Peninsular Ranges of Baja California. It was separated from the North American Plate and transported north by the action of the San Andreas Fault from an original position. It is predominantly Mesozoic granitic and pre-Cretaceous metamorphic rocks. There is some Cretaceous sedimentary rock of the Great Valley Sequence, considerable Miocene marine sediments, and some other Cenozoic sediments. Units west of the Sur-Nacimiento Fault are dominated by rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage.

The basement rocks of the Santa Lucia Range contain Mesozoic Franciscan and Salinian Block rocks. The Franciscan complex is composed of greywacke sandstone and greenstone, with serpentinite bodies and other Ultramafic rocks present. Small areas of marble and limestone lenses form resistant outcrops that are prominent landscape features, often white to light gray in color. The Salinian block is made up of highly fractured, and deeply weathered meta-sediments, especially biotite schist and gneiss, intruded by plutonic (granitic) rocks such as quartz diorite and granodiorite. Both formations have been disrupted and tectonically slivered by motion on the San Andreas and associated fault systems. The Palo Colorado and Church Creek faults are prominent features influencing the linear northwest–southeast alignment of primary drainages.

The Palo Colorado-San Gregorio fault system transitions onshore at Doud Creek, about south of Point Lobos, exposing the western edge of the Salinian block. Stream canyons frequently follow the north-westerly trending fault lines, rather than descending directly to the coast. The Salinian block is immediately south of the Monterey Submarine Canyon, one of the largest submarine canyon systems in the world, which is believed to have been an ancient outlet for the Colorado River.

The region is also traversed by the Sur-Hill fault, which is noticeable at Pfeiffer Falls in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. The waterfall were formed when the stream flowed over the hard gneiss of the Salinian block and encountered the softer Santa Margarita Sandstone. The falls were formed when the softer sandstone was worn away. The interior canyons are typically deep and narrow, and even in the summer sunshine only reaches many of the canyon bottoms for a few hours. The land is mostly steep, rocky, semi-arid except for the narrow canyons, and inaccessible. The Little Sur River canyon is characteristic of the Ventana Wilderness region: steep-sided, sharp-crested ridges separating valleys. At the mouth of the Little Sur river are some of the largest sand dunes on the Big Sur coast.

About 50 streams flow out of the mountains into the sea. A few of them, including the Big Sur and Little Sur Rivers, Big Creek, Garrapata Creek, and Salmon Creek, are large enough to support anadromous and resident fish.

== Transportation ==

California State Route 1 runs along the Big Sur coast on the coastal slopes of the range, while U.S. Route 101 lies in the Salinas Valley to the East, and crosses the southern Santa Lucia Range over Cuesta Pass to reach San Luis Obispo. California State Route 41 crosses the range from Atascadero to Morro Bay and Route 46 crosses from Templeton to Cambria. The only other paved road across the Santa Lucia Range is Nacimiento-Fergusson Road, connecting Lucia to Jolon.

== Folklore == 

Since at least the 1930s, accounts of encounters with Dark Watchers or &quot;Los Vigilantes Oscuros&quot; have been associated with the Santa Lucia Range, described as shadowy figures which watch hikers from atop mountain ridges.

The Lost Padre Mines of the Carmel Mission have become part of local folklore, with their legacy recounted through various accounts, including those within Randall Reinstadt&#x27;s works such as &quot;Ghosts, Bandits, and Legends of Old Monterey, Carmel and Surrounding Areas&quot; and &quot;Tales and Treasures of California Missions.&quot; These narratives suggest that indigenous communities held knowledge of abundant gold deposits concealed within the untamed terrain of the Santa Lucia Mountains. As legends of these riches were passed down over time, the Lost Padre Mines attracted attention. Versions of these legends appear to have originated from long-time residents of Carmel Valley. The stories if ghosts may be attributed to descendants of and the last residents of the native people who remained hidden deep in the mountains after the missions failed.

== Contemporary history ==

Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 crashed in the mountains near Cayucos on December 7, 1987 after a gunman killed both pilots, causing the aircraft to crash. A total of 43 people were killed with no survivors.

=== Wine ===

The Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, an American Viticultural Area and producer of California wine, is located on the southeastern slopes of the mountains, above the Salinas valley.

=== Winds ===
Like the well known Santa Ana winds of Southern California or the Sundowner winds of Santa Barbara, Santa Lucia&#x27;s Cuesta Grade on Highway 101 has potential to produce some powerful katabatic winds. Temperatures have been recorded jumping 40 degrees F, to 110 F, in just three hours.

<text>The deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus) is a species of scorpion, a member of the family Buthidae. It is also known as the Palestine yellow scorpion, Omdurman scorpion, and Naqab desert scorpion, as well as by many other colloquial names, which generally originate from the commercial captive trade of the animal. To eliminate confusion, especially important with potentially dangerous species, the scientific name is normally used to refer to them. The name &quot;Leiurus quinquestriatus&quot; roughly translates into English as &quot;five-striped smooth-tail&quot;. In 2014, the subspecies &quot;L. q. hebraeus&quot; was separated from it and elevated to its own species &quot;Leiurus hebraeus&quot;. Other species of the genus &quot;Leiurus&quot; are also often referred to as &quot;deathstalkers&quot;. &quot;Leiurus quinquestriatus&quot; is yellow, and long, with an average of .

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Leiurus quinquestriatus&quot; can be found in desert and scrubland habitats ranging from North Africa through to the Middle East. Its range covers a wide sweep of territory in the Sahara, Arabian Desert, Thar Desert, and Central Asia, from Algeria and Mali in the west through to Egypt, Ethiopia, Asia Minor and the Arabian Peninsula, eastwards to Kazakhstan and western India in the northeast and southeast.

== Venom ==
Neurotoxins in &quot;L. quinquestriatus&quot; venom include:
* Chlorotoxin
* Charybdotoxin, a blocker of calcium-activated potassium channels.
* Scyllatoxin
* Agitoxins types one, two and three
Other components : 
* Lq2, which gets its name from this scorpion.

===Hazards===
The deathstalker is one of the most dangerous species of scorpions. Its venom is a powerful mixture of neurotoxins, with a low lethal dose. While a sting from this scorpion is extraordinarily painful, it normally would not kill a healthy adult human. However, young children, the elderly, or infirm (such as those with a heart condition and those who are allergic) are at much greater risk. Any envenomation runs the risk of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction to the venom. A study from Israel shows a high rate of pancreatitis following envenomation. If a sting from &quot;Leiurus quinquestriatus&quot; does prove deadly, the cause of death is usually pulmonary edema.

Antivenom for the treatment of deathstalker envenomations is produced by pharmaceutical companies AbbVie and Sanofi Pasteur, and by the National Antivenom and Vaccine Production Center in Riyadh. Envenomation by the deathstalker is considered a medical emergency even with antivenom treatment, as its venom is unusually resistant to treatment and typically requires large doses of antivenom.

In the United States and other countries outside of the typical range of the deathstalker, there is the additional complicating factor that none of the existing antivenoms are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (or equivalent agencies) and are only available as investigational drugs (INDs). The US Armed Forces maintain an investigational drug application for the AVPC-Riyadh antivenom in the event of envenomation of soldiers in the Gulf War theater of operations, and the Florida Antivenin Bank, managed by the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department, maintains Sanofi Pasteur&#x27;s Scorpifav antivenom for the deathstalker.

===Uses===
A component of the deathstalker&#x27;s venom, the peptide chlorotoxin, has shown potential for treating human brain tumors. There has also been some evidence to show that other components of the venom may aid in the regulation of insulin and could be used to treat diabetes.

In 2015 clinical trials were beginning of the use of chlorotoxin with a fluorescent molecule attached as brain tumour &quot;paint&quot; (BLZ-100), to mark cancerous cells in real time during an operation. This is important in brain cancer surgery, where it is vital both to remove as many cancerous cells as possible, but not to remove healthy tissue necessary for brain functioning. In preclinical animal trials the technique could highlight extremely small clusters of as few as 200 cancer cells, compared to the standard use of MRI, with a lower limit in excess of 500,000.

==Legality==
Possession of &quot;L. quinquestriatus&quot; may be illegal or regulated in countries with laws prohibiting the keeping of dangerous animals in general. Jurisdictions are increasingly and explicitly including &quot;L. quinquestriatus&quot; in laws requiring permits to keep animals which are not usual pets, or restricting possession of dangerous animals, and in some cases have prohibited the keeping of &quot;L. quinquestriatus&quot; save by licensed zoos and educational facilities.

In several jurisdictions departments of fish and wildlife require permits for many animals, and a number of cities and municipal governments have prohibited their possession in their bylaws.

<doc id="1204843" wikidata="Q8519545" url="?curid=1204843" title="Junipero Serra Peak">
<text>Junipero Serra Peak is the highest mountain in the Santa Lucia range of central California with a height of . It is also the highest peak in Monterey County, and is located within the boundaries of Los Padres National Forest. It is named after Saint Junípero Serra, the Spanish Franciscan priest who founded the California Missions in the 18th century. There is a fire lookout, with a tower and building, near the peak that was constructed around 1935. An unauthorized skiing operation on the summit was reported sometime before 1970. Good astronomical observing conditions were an early attraction to the peak. Astronomers scratched a trail to the summit in January 1880 to observe a total eclipse of the sun. Observations from the peak were also made on the transit of Venus in 1882.

== Toponymy ==
It was originally named Santa Lucia Peak, as it is the highest point in the range of the same name. Wanting to honor Junípero Serra, the Native Daughters of the Golden West had bestowed his name upon a Sierra Nevada peak in June 1905. However, the Sierra Club recommended that the name be transferred to Santa Lucia Peak. The United States Board on Geographic Names officially approved the name change in 1906
finding that Junípero Serra was familiar with the Santa Lucia Mountains, but in all likelihood he had never encountered the Sierra Nevada.

The peak was named &quot;Pimkolam&quot; by the Salinan Native Americans.

== Climate ==
Since the peak is over , temperatures in winter are low enough to support snowfall and relatively high amounts of precipitation compared to the Salinas Valley and places farther east in the Coast Ranges. Although by far the tallest of the Santa Lucia Range peaks, Junipero Serra Peak appears to have a drier climate than the others. No long-term weather data are available. Walker (1970), an astronomer who spent several seasons on the summit, measured of rain plus of snow during the 1965–66 season. In adjacent regions this was an &quot;average&quot; season. In the wet 1966–67 season he measured of rain plus 304 cm (1 19.7 inches) of snow.

There is no surface water above 5,000 ft in summer. In years with above-average rainfall some creeks may start at ; permanent creeks flow at .

== Ecology ==
Montane pine forest dominated by sugar pine covers areas of the peak&#x27;s north summit and the upper reaches of water courses on the north slope. Junípero Serra Peak and nearby Cone Peak sugar pine forests are isolated from the next sugar pine stands by 220 km. An interesting feature of this sugar pine population is the unexpectedly high frequency of a major gene for resistance to white pine blister rust. This fatal disease, caused by an exotic pathogen, has caused high mortality to sugar pine and other white pine in North America. Natural resistance in other sugar pine populations ranges from near 0% in the South Cascade Range to 8% in the southern Sierra Nevada; on Junipero Serra, it is 8.9%. No blister rust has as yet been reported in this stand. The Junípero Serra Peak pines are surrounded by a vast area of scrubby mixed hardwood forest and chaparral. Understory shrubs and herbs associated with the pine forest are also isolated from distant forests, and many of them differ from the nearby isolated montane species on Cone Peak. The most interesting disjunct is &quot;Cycladenia humilus&quot; var. &quot;venusta&quot;, which has one population under the pines on the summit of Junipero Serra Peak and three tiny colonies on Cone Peak. The type specimen of this variety is collected at the peak of Junipero Serra Peak.

Mountain chickadee, common in southern California and Sierra Nevada montane forest, is present in the South Coast Ranges only in the Junipero Serra Peak and Cone Peak forests.

== Fire history ==
Junipero Serra Peak has a long history of wildfires. Between 1640 and 1907 fires hot enough to produce basal scars on pines in a small isolated sugar pine forest in the Santa Lucia Range of central California occurred on average once every 21 years. Except for two small lightning fires that were quickly extinguished, no fires occurred in the pine forest after 1907 until the lightning-caused Marble Cone Fire burned the entire forest in 1977. This was the most intense burn recorded within the life of the present forest. It caused significant loss of pines, particularly within the 40 percent of the forest on the north summit above 1600 m elevation. Changes in forest composition resulting from the Marble Cone Fire suggest that several more fires following 50-75 year intervals may eliminate sugar pine forest above 1600 m on Junípero Serra Peak.

More recently, the Dolan Fire burned the southern slopes and upper portions of the northern summit in the fall of 2020. Along with much of the southern Ventana Wilderness, Junipero Serra was also burned extensively in the 2008 Indians Fire.

<text>Anthony Orlando Calabrese, Sr. (July 20, 1907 – July 8, 1991) was an American politician of the Democratic party who served as a member of the Ohio Senate. He was the first Italian American to serve as Minority Leader of the Ohio Senate.

Calabrese, born as Orlando Anthony Calabrese in Forli del Sannio, Italy, immigrated to the United States in 1920 at the age of 13 and loved his new home in Cleveland, Ohio. He, and his wife, Mary (née Buzzelli) were the parents of two sons, Anthony O. Calabrese, Jr., and Leonard M. Calabrese. Both sons are still active contributing members to the city of Cleveland. Anthony O. Calabrese. Jr., has served the local and state government in several elected and appointed positions and Leonard M. Calabrese has worked for the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland during his long and dedicated service. He has been President of Catholic Community Connection since 2008. In 1970, Anthony O. Calabrese was the Democratic nominee for the office of Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. He chaired Italo-Americans for Kennedy in 1960, Italian Americans for Johnson in 1964 and Italian Americans for Humphrey in 1968. He also co-chaired the Nationalities Division of the Ohio Democratic Party in those years. Anthony O. Calabrese was also a national leader among Italian Americans, serving for many years as a leader in the Sons of Italy in America culminating in becoming the First Supreme Venerable and also helping to found the Commission on Social Justice. He was awarded the Cross of Merit from the Republic of Italy for his civic and humanitarian work, especially advocating for orphans and earthquake victims in Italy and for immigrants in the United States. He testified before Congressional committees in 1965 in favor of the historic Immigration Reform Act which was signed by President Johnson, ending discriminatory provisions against Italians and other groups. Calabrese was also the sponsor of legislation making Columbus Day a legal holiday in Ohio and worked for that nationally. He was also a leader in establishing Cleveland State University, Cuyahoga Community College, and the Golden Buckeye Card, as well as being a champion for the developmentally disabled, senior citizens, veterans, and the working poor. He was regarded as a friend of Labor and a fighter for the &quot;little guy.&quot; His famous slogan was &quot;What do you want? Good grammar or Good government?&quot; 

Anthony O. Calabrese Sr., and Jr., served as the only father-son elected representatives in the Ohio senate. He also was the grandfather of Anthony O. Calabrese III, who pleaded guilty to racketeering, bribery, conspiracy and obstruction charges after his indictment on 18 federal public corruption charges.

<text>The Madagascar national football team, nicknamed Barea after the island&#x27;s zebu, is the national team of Madagascar and is controlled by the Malagasy Football Federation. It has never qualified for the finals of the World Cup. It took part in its first Africa Cup of Nations in 2019. Among its biggest wins was a 1–0 home victory over Egypt in the qualification rounds of the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations until being surpassed by a recent 2–0 win over Nigeria in the group stage of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Reflecting the official name of the country at the time, the team was known as the Malagasy Republic national football team between 1958 and 1975.

==History==
Madagascar made its debut in 1947 in a home match against Mauritius which was lost 2–1. The game was part of a &quot;Triangulaire&quot; tournament between Madagascar, Mauritius and Reunion. Madagascar&#x27;s second match was at home to Reunion and saw their first ever win, 4–2. The triangular tournament was staged every year until 1958, and Madagascar&#x27;s highest-scoring game was on 13 July 1953 when they beat Reunion 6–4 at home. Their worst loss was on 31 July 1952 when they lost 7–0 to Mauritius in Reunion.

Madagascar played against opposition different from Mauritius or Reunion for the first time in 1960, as part of a tournament between French-speaking nations held on the island. In their first match on 15 April 1960 they beat the Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) 6–1. The second game was a quarter-final against France&#x27;s amateur side on 17 April and was lost 2–1. On 19 April Madagascar beat the Congo 8–1 in the third-place play-off.

In April 1963, Madagascar entered another competition for French-speaking countries, this time in Senegal, and was placed in a group with Dahomey (now Benin), Liberia and Chad. They opened with a 1–0 win over Dahomey on 11 April, and then beat Chad 2–1 on 13 April and Liberia 3–1 on 15 April. In the semi-finals, Madagascar were beaten 2–1 by Tunisia on 19 April, and then lost 4–1 to France&#x27;s amateur team in the third-place play-off on 21 April.

In September 1963 the &quot;Triangulaire&quot; between Madagascar, Reunion and Mauritius was reinstated for the first time since 1958. On 15 September they beat Reunion 6–1 at home, and on 18 September drew 1–1 to Mauritius in a home game which was abandoned.

On 16 October 2018, Madagascar qualified to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in their history, after they won 1–0 against Equatorial Guinea. During their debut match against Guinea on 22 June 2019, Anicet Abel scored Madagascar&#x27;s first-ever AFCON goal and secured their first point of the competition with a 2–2 draw against Guinea. The team defeated Burundi in their second match and followed it up with a 2–0 victory over the Super Eagles of Nigeria to top Group B. Then Madagascar advanced to quarter-finals after beating DR Congo in the round of 16. The team&#x27;s successful performance was coined by pundits as the Iceland of Africa, resembling the shockingly successful debut of Iceland in UEFA Euro 2016. However, Madagascar&#x27;s dream ended abruptly after suffering a 0–3 defeat at the hand of another former champion, Tunisia.

<doc id="1204877" wikidata="Q561163" url="?curid=1204877" title="Helmer Hanssen">
<text>Helmer Julius Hanssen (24 September 1870 – 2 August 1956) was a Norwegian sailor, pilot and polar explorer. He participated in three of the polar expeditions led by Roald Amundsen and was one of the first five explorers to reach the South Pole.

== Background==
Helmer Hanssen was born in Bjørnskinn, on the island of Andøya in Nordland, Norway. He was an experienced ice pilot, a skill he had learned while hunting around Spitsbergen. Between 1894 and 1897, he hunted small whales and seals in the Arctic Sea. He later sailed for the Norwegian shipping company, Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab.

== Career ==
From 1903 to 1905 Helmer Hanssen participated in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s successful search for the Northwest Passage, as second mate on board the ship &quot;Gjøa&quot;. On the expedition he learned from the Inuit how to drive sled dogs. In 1910 he headed south with Amundsen to conquer the South Pole, this time as an expert dog driver. He was also in charge of navigation, carrying the master compass on his sledge.

He was one of the first five people to reach the South Pole on 14 December 1911, along with Roald Amundsen, Olav Bjaaland, Oscar Wisting, and Sverre Hassel. During their stay at the South Pole, it is estimated that Hanssen passed within 200 yards (180 meters) of the mathematical South Pole point. This was during one of his ski runs which Amundsen had ordered be performed to completely encircle or &quot;box&quot; the pole, to ensure that there was no doubt that the expedition had attained the pole. For his participation in the expedition, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (&quot;Sydpolsmedaljen&quot;), the Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition.

In 1919 he once again went north, this time as captain on &quot;Maud&quot; in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s Northeast Passage expedition. Helmer Hanssen was awarded the Knight of St. Olav for exceptional seamanship on Roald Amundsen&#x27;s expeditions in the northern and southern parts of the world. In 1936 Hanssen published his autobiography &quot;The Voyages of a Modern Viking&quot;, (London: G. Routledge &amp; Sons Limited, 1936).

== Legacy ==

A statue of Helmer Hanssen together with the rest of Roald Amundsen&#x27;s Antarctic explorer team is located at the Fram Museum at Bygdøy in Oslo, Norway. A scientific research vessel, the FF Helmer Hanssen, has also been named in his honour.

Hanssen was portrayed by Jan Hårstad in the 1985 television serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;, and by Mads Sjøgård Pettersen in the 2019 film &quot;Amundsen&quot;.

Today, the site is home to modern museum facilities, five Gilded Age homes, the Minnetrista Boulevard Historic District (added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012), and over 20 acres of cultivated greenspace, including horticultural and ornamental gardens. From the mid-1890s until the 1980s, Minnetrista was home to the extended Ball family, inventors of the Ball Mason jar.

According to Ball family legend, members of the family suggested the name “Minnetrista” for the property. The word combines the Sioux (Dakota) word “mna” (pronounced “mini”), which means water, with the English word “tryst,” which means a “gathering place.”

Originally, the name Minnetrista was connected to one of the Ball family homes but today the entire site is very strongly associated with the word. Tied as it is to the Ball family history, the term “Minnetrista” does muddy this site’s actual indigenous history, which is not directly connected to the Sioux. Today, Minnetrista Museum &amp; Gardens strives to make this “gathering place by the water” an inclusive community resource for all the people of East Central Indiana and beyond.

== Early site history ==

On the northern bank of the White River, the site that is today Minnetrista existed on the outskirts of Muncie, Indiana throughout the nineteenth century. The city of Muncie was incorporated in 1865 to the south of the White River, developed out of the settlement of Munseetown founded just four decades earlier. That original settlement was built upon land opened to white settlers by the 1818 Treaty of St. Mary, which stripped Midwestern indigenous communities of their ancestral lands and forced their movement west of the Mississippi.

Prior to this, this part of East Central Indiana had long been home to the Potowatomi and the Miami. In the eighteenth century, part of the Minnetrista site itself was also home to a settlement of the Delaware Nation, who had been systematically driven farther west over many decades because of the advancement of white settlers. The Delaware too were forced to relocate in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, their communities resettling in Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Canada.

== &quot;Home of the Ball Jar&quot; ==

In the mid-1880s, the Ball family made the decision to move their commercial glass business, Ball Brothers Manufacturing Company, to Muncie. A local natural gas boom in East Central Indiana was then attracting a great deal of industrial business to the region, and the area’s social character appealed to the family. In describing his first visit to Muncie in 1886, Frank C. Ball wrote in his memoirs, “There was nothing about the town that particularly appealed to me, but the men were all courteous, kind, and businesslike.” By the early 1900s, the Ball brothers had expanded their glass business in Muncie into a large, well-respected operation that was producing canning jars and related items in mass for the global market.
Between 1893 and 1907, the five Ball brothers each married and built their family homes side by side along the stretch of land they purchased on the north side of the White River. All but one of those homes still stands today. The Frank C. Ball family home, historically known as Minnetrista before the name was applied to the entire property, burned down in 1967. Today, Minnetrista Museum &amp; Gardens oversees the care of three of those houses: Oakhurst, the Lucius L. Ball House, and the Mary Lincoln Cottage.

The Ball families at Minnetrista

== The museum today ==
Members of the second generation of the Ball family began considering the idea of transforming the Minnetrista site into a public space in the late 1970s. Elisabeth Ball, the last member of the family to live full-time on the Boulevard, died in 1982, and plans were subsequently put in place to build a museum facility on the site of the former Frank C. Ball house (the original house was destroyed by fire in 1967) . Groundbreaking for the then Minnetrista Cultural Center began in March 1987 and the building opened to the public on December 10, 1988. The organization’s name changed to Minnetrista Museum &amp; Gardens in 2021.

Minnetrista is one of several legacy organizations founded by the Ball family that continue to serve the East Central Indiana community. Minnetrista’s sister legacy organizations include: Ball State University, IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital, Ball Brothers Foundation, and the George and Frances Ball Foundation. As close collaborative community partners, the presence of these other organizations can be seen directly on the Minnetrista campus. For example, Ball State University Foundation owns and cares for the Nebosham house, now known as the Ed &amp; Bertha C. Ball Center. In partnership with owners Ball Brothers Foundation, Maplewood home is offered as housing for advanced medical students studying at the Indiana University School of Medicine.

==Collections and archives==
Minnetrista&#x27;s Collections and Storytelling division collects, preserves, and provides access to materials documenting the history of the Ball company, Ball family, and East Central Indiana. The museum&#x27;s collection is called the Heritage Collection.

Comprising more than 17,000 objects and 1,800 linear feet of archival materials, the Heritage Collection includes Ball company records and an extensive holding of Ball-made products. The collection also features artwork, other regionally manufactured goods, historic textiles, correspondence, photographs, and more.

Minnetrista is open to the public for research. Researchers are encouraged to explore the museum’s online collections to learn more about its holdings.

==Exhibitions==

Minnetrista curates a regular annual rotation of art, history, and family-oriented exhibitions. In addition, the campus is home to several permanent exhibit offerings that tell the histories of life and events on the Minnetrista site, including:

* &quot;Oakhurst Experience&quot;: Opened to the public in 2019, the &quot;Oakhurst Experience&quot; is located in the historic Oakhurst Home that was once home to George and Frances Ball and their daughter Elisabeth. The &quot;Experience&quot; combines a traditional historic home offering with a vibrant celebration of the passions the family shared: literacy, family, and canning. Visitors can enjoy hundreds of books in the library of the house that once contained the largest collection of rare children’s books in the world. And the kitchen is an ode to home food preservation, featuring interactives that teach about canning and preservation methods in the spot where the Ball Blue Book was created.
* &quot;Bob Ross Experience&quot;: Opened in 2020, the &quot;Bob Ross Experience&quot; is housed in the very space where “The Joy of Painting” was filmed–in the Lucius L. Ball home on the Minnetrista campus. The site-specific exhibit opens by telling the story of Bob’s relationship with Minnetrista and the organization’s founder, Ed Ball, a second-generation Ball family member who was instrumental in helping to save Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) when funding was threatened in the 1970s. The exhibit consists of the faithfully recreated TV studio, a 1980s-style living room, dedicated art gallery, and painting workshop space and is filled with authentic objects, historic photos, original paintings, and interactive interpretive elements exploring the philosophy and art of Bob Ross.

== Programs ==
Minnetrista offers community centric and family oriented programming throughout the year, from school tours, to painting and glass-working workshops, to three large scale signature events throughout the year.

* Signature events: Faeries, Sprites &amp; Lights, Enchanted Luminaria Walk, Garden Fair
* Farmers Market

== Gardens ==
When the Ball family moved to Muncie and began building their homes, they also transformed the landscape, developing beautiful lawns, award winning rose gardens, fruit orchards, and ornamental gardens. Since the museum’s opening in 1988, the historic greenspaces around Minnetrista’s 40-acre campus have been revitalized and supplemented by new formal gardens inspired by the Ball family legacy and Minnetrista’s history. These include:

* Oakhurst Gardens
* Orchard Garden 
* Culinary Herb Garden 
* Rose Garden 
* Wishing Well Garden 
* Backyard Garden
* The Nature Area

<doc id="1204888" wikidata="Q36808" url="?curid=1204888" title="Tzeltal language">
<text>Tzeltal or Tseltal () is a Mayan language spoken in the Mexican state of Chiapas, mostly in the municipalities of Ocosingo, Altamirano, Huixtán, Tenejapa, Yajalón, Chanal, Sitalá, Amatenango del Valle, Socoltenango, Las Rosas, Chilón, San Juan Cancuc, San Cristóbal de las Casas and Oxchuc. Tzeltal is one of many Mayan languages spoken near this eastern region of Chiapas, including Tzotzil, Chʼol, and Tojolabʼal, among others. There is also a small Tzeltal diaspora in other parts of Mexico and the United States, primarily as a result of unfavorable economic conditions in Chiapas.

The area in which Tzeltal is spoken can be divided in half by an imaginary north–south line; to the west, near Oxchuc, is the ancestral home of the Tzeltal people, predating Spanish colonials, while the eastern portion was settled primarily in the second half of the twentieth century. Partially as a result of these migrations, during which the Tzeltal people and other cultural groups found each other in close proximity, four different dialects of Tzeltal have been described: north, central (including Oxchuc), south, and southeast, though the southeastern dialect is today spoken only by a few elderly and geographically dispersed speakers. It is a living language with some 371,730 speakers as of 2005, including approximately 50,000 monolinguals.

==Overview and current status==
Tzeltal forms, together with the Tzotzil language, a branch of the Mayan languages, called Tzeltalan, which in turn forms a branch with the Chʼolan languages called Cholan–Tzeltalan. All these languages are the most spoken Mayan languages in Chiapas today. Historically, the branches are believed to have split about 1,400 years ago. Also, some researchers believe that the Tzeltal language has been spoken as far away as in Guatemala. While Greenberg groups Tzeltal with the proposed Penutian superfamily, this hypothesis is not well attested.

The Ethnologue classifies Tzeltal as a 5 out of 10 (Developing) on its scale of endangerment status, and additionally describes its use as &quot;vigorous.&quot; Nevertheless, its usage is almost exclusively oral; schools rarely incorporate Tzeltal materials, and as a result almost everyone under the age of 30 is bilingual in Spanish.

One of the primary differences between the Tzeltalan and the Chʼol languages today is that while the Chʼol languages feature split ergativity, the Tzeltalan languages are fully morphologically ergative.

Tzeltal language programming is carried out by the CDI&#x27;s radio station XEVFS, broadcasting from Las Margaritas, Chiapas.

In 2013, Pope Francis approved translations of the prayers for Mass and the celebration of sacraments into Tzotzil and Tzeltal. The translations include &quot;the prayers used for Mass, marriage, baptisms, confirmations, confessions, ordinations and the anointing of the sick ... Bishop Arizmendi said Oct. 6 that the texts, which took approximately eight years to translate, would be used in his diocese and the neighboring Archdiocese of Tuxtla Gutierrez. Mass has been celebrated in the diocese in recent years with the assistance of translators – except during homilies – Bishop Arizmendi said in an article in the newspaper La Jornada.

== Phonology ==
The phonology of Tzeltal is quite straightforward with a common vowel inventory and a typical consonant inventory for Mayan languages. Some phonological processes do occur, however, including assimilation, epenthesis, lenition and reduplication.

=== Vowels ===
Tzeltal has 5 vowels:

Whether vowel length is phonemic in Tzeltal is debatable.

=== Consonants ===
Tzeltal has 21 consonants, including the glottal stop. Though Tzeltal does not have a standardized orthography, the bracketed letters in the chart below represent one orthography heavily derivative of Spanish:

 has three allophones:
* at the end of a word: 
* [] between vowels: 
* everywhere else: 
However, in the Oxchuc (central) dialect, the ejective does not exist, having been replaced by the phone . Phonemic charts representing this dialect would include but not . In this dialect, suffixes carrying often may be realized as . In the initial position of a suffix following a consonant, it is realized as the true stop , but in the postvocalic position it is preceded by a glottal stop, such that sounds like . When is found in the final position, it can be pronounced as , or even disappear completely; thus could sound like , , or even .

 has two allophones:
* when it is the first member of a CC-consonant cluster,
: or if it is at the end of a word: 
* everywhere else: 
Note, however, that it can be interchangeably or in the beginning of a word, as in 

===Phonological processes===

When a vowel is found in the context [_ʔC], the vowel is pronounced with creaky voice.

Contraction may occur with consecutive identical phonemes, either at a word- or morpheme-boundary. For example, the word /ta aʼtel/ (&quot;at work&quot;) may be pronounced [taʼtel], the two [a] phonemes having been pronounced as one.

The phoneme [h] may undergo a number of processes depending on context and dialect. In most dialects, most notably that of Bachajón, word-final [h] is very light and in rapid speech often disappears entirely if not protected by some other element. For example, in the Bachajón dialect, the nominal root &quot;bah&quot; (&quot;corncob/field mouse&quot;) in isolation would lose the final [h] and sound like &quot;ba&quot;, but if the root takes the particle -&quot;e&quot;, the word will be pronounced [bahe]. This process does not hold true for word-final [j]. All dialects retain [h] before voiceless consonants. Similarly, medial [h] has disappeared from the Oxchuc dialect but not from the Bachajón dialect, such that &quot;yahl&quot; (&quot;below&quot;) and &quot;chʼahil&quot; (&quot;smoke&quot;) in Bachajón would be said &quot;yal&quot; and &quot;chʼail&quot; in Oxchuc. Further, in the Oxchuc dialect, an [h] preceding a plain consonant will change the consonant into an ejective stop; thus &quot;baht&quot;&#x27; (&quot;he/she went&quot;) in Oxchuc corresponds to &quot;baht&quot; in other dialects.

In the majority of cases, root-initial glottal stop is pronounced, though it is often omitted in orthography. [ʼ] is only lost when the root is closely related to the preceding word. For example, the glottal stop in the particle -&quot;ʼix&quot; (&quot;already&quot;) will never be pronounced, because the particle always attaches to the preceding word. The prefix &quot;ʼa-&quot; (&quot;you/your&quot;) sometimes retains the glottal stop, but not when it occurs in a verb form. Similarly, the glottal stop in the particle &quot;maʼ&quot; has been lost in verbal forms. Thus, words beginning or ending with a vowel and not a glottal stop should be pronounced together with the word preceding or following it. For example, &quot;tal ix&quot; (&quot;he already came&quot;) would sound like [talix].

===Root syllable structure and stress===

The following is a general list of common root shapes in Tzeltal. For further examples and detail, see section 3.3 below.

*VC (including glottalized consonants and glides)
*CV
*CVC (including CVʼ, CVh, CVw, and CVy)
*CV&quot;h&quot;C
*CVʼC 
*CCVC (in which the initial consonants are limited to &quot;s, x,&quot; and &quot;j&quot;).

Common bisyllabic roots include:
*CVCV
*CVCVC
*CV&quot;h&quot;CVC
*CVʼCVC
These final three bisyllabic root constructions result almost always from the combination of two roots, and are always nominal roots.
Stress always falls on the last syllable of a word. If a root takes a suffix or if it follows a particle, the accent falls on the latter. Many Spanish loanwords retain penultimate stress in the Spanish style.

===Minimal pairs===
Kaufman provides the following list of minimal pairs from &quot;dialects other than that of Aguacatenango,&quot; though recall that, for example, [pʼ] is a phoneme in some dialects and does not exist in others.

==Morphology==

===Typology===
Tzeltal is an ergative–absolutive language, meaning that the single argument of an intransitive verb takes the same form as the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the subject of a transitive verb. It is also an agglutinative language, which means that words are typically formed by placing affixes on a root, with each affix representing one morpheme (as opposed to a fusional language, in which affixes may include multiple morphemes). Tzeltal is further classified as a head-marking language, meaning that grammatical marking typically occurs on the heads of phrases, rather than on its modifiers or dependents.

===Types of morphemes and derivational processes===
There are three types of morphemes in Tzeltal: roots, affixes, and clitics. Kaufman distinguishes between roots, from which stems are derived, and stems, which are inflected to form full morphological words. Each root and stem belongs to a class, which determines the ways in which it may be affixed; see the section below for details. Affixes cannot appear alone; they are bound morphemes found only attached to roots and stems, and in Tzeltal are usually suffixes. Derivational affixes turn roots into stems and can change the grammatical category of the root, thought not all roots need to be affixed to become a stem. Inflectional affixes denote syntactic relations, such as agreement, tense, and aspect. Clitics are syntactically and prosodically conditioned morphemes and only occur as satellites to words.

In addition to denoting grammatical possession, the suffix &quot;-Vl&quot; in Tzeltal is highly productive as a means of noun-to-noun, noun-to-adjective, and adjective-to-noun derivation, each exemplified below:

* &quot;jaʼ &quot; (&quot;water&quot;)→&quot;jaʼ-al&quot; (&quot;rain&quot;)
* &quot;lum&quot; (&quot;earth&quot;)→&quot;lum-il chʼo&quot; (&quot;field mouse&quot;); this is a case of noun-to-adjective derivation, as &quot;chʼo&quot; (&quot;mouse&quot;) is modified by the derived adjective &quot;lum-il&quot;.
* &quot;lek&quot; (&quot;good&quot;)→&quot;lek-il-al&quot; (&quot;well-being&quot;)

In the case of noun-to-noun derivation, the suffix &quot;-il&quot; is particularly prominent, often used to produce a noun marked for non-referentiality in cases of interrogation. It is followed by the additional suffix &quot;-uk&quot;. In the sentence &quot;Banti wits-il-uk ay te ja-na e&quot; (&quot;Which mountain is your house on?&quot;), the word &quot;Banti&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;) receives these suffixes as it is the thing in question .

In addition to suffixation and prefixation, Tzeltal uses the morphological processes of infixation, reduplication, and compounding to derive words. The only infix is &quot;-j-&quot;, and only appears in CVC roots, yielding a CVjC root. With a transitive verb, &quot;-j-&quot; derives a passive; compare &quot;mak&quot; (&quot;to close&quot;) and &quot;majk&quot; (&quot;to be closed&quot;).

Reduplication can only occur with monosyllablic roots, and is typically used with numbers and numeral classifiers. With classifiers, reduplication also entails the insertion of a V&quot;l&quot; syllable between the repeated roots. For example, &quot;wojkʼ&quot; (&quot;group&quot;) can become &quot;wojkʼ-ol-wojkʼ&quot; (&quot;group by group/one group after the other&quot;). When a redoubled root takes the suffix &quot;-tik&quot;, it creates the effect of a distributive plural; thus &quot;be&quot; (&quot;road&quot;) becomes &quot;be-be-tik&quot; (&quot;a network of roads&quot;). With redoubled adjective roots, &quot;-tik&quot; attenuates the quality of the verb, such that &quot;tsaj&quot; (&quot;red&quot;) becomes &quot;tsaj-tsaj-tik&quot; (&quot;reddish&quot;).

Compounding is most commonly used to compound a transitive verb with its object, in so doing creating a noun describing the action in question.

* &quot;pas&quot; (&quot;make&quot;) + &quot;na&quot; (&quot;house&quot;)→&quot;pasna&quot; (&quot;house construction&quot;)
* &quot;pakʼ&quot; (&quot;strike with the hand&quot;) + &quot;waj&quot; (&quot;tortilla&quot;)→&quot;pakʼwaj&quot; (&quot;tortilla baking&quot;)

===Stem and root classes===
There are six stem classes defined by unique sets of inflectional affixes with which they may occur. The unique set for each stem class may be increased by up to four affixes. Although the total set representing each stem class is unique, certain subsets of affixes are shared by multiple stem classes. Kaufman describes six stem classes, followed by his abbreviations: nouns (&quot;n&quot;), adjectives (&quot;aj&quot;), transitive verbs (&quot;TV&quot;), intransitive verbs (&quot;iv&quot;), affect verbs (&quot;av&quot;), and inflectible particles (&quot;ip&quot;). A seventh class, particles, exists but is never inflected; they are radical or derived stems that function as words in syntactic constructions.

There are seven classes of roots:
# noun root (&quot;N&quot;)
# adjective root (&quot;A&quot;)
# transitive verb root (&quot;T&quot;)
# positional verb root (&quot;P&quot;)
# intransitive verb root (&quot;I&quot;)
# inflectable particle root (&quot;Pi&quot;)
# particle root (&quot;Pn&quot;)

When roots function as stems, they belong to the following stem classes (expressed using the abbreviations described above):
# &quot;N&quot; roots become &quot;n&quot; stems
# &quot;A&quot; roots become &quot;aj&quot; stems
# &quot;T&quot; roots become &quot;TV&quot; stems
# &quot;P&quot; roots become &quot;TV&quot; stems
# &quot;I&quot; roots become &quot;iv&quot; stems
# &quot;Pi&quot; roots become &quot;ip&quot; stems
# &quot;Pn&quot; roots become &quot;p&quot; stems

There is a small set of multivalent stems that may occur with the inflectional affixes of more than one stem class with no change in the morpheme. Kaufman supplies this list, but does not say whether or not it is complete.

*/tʃʼày/ &quot;to lose&quot; (transitive verb) or &quot;to be lost&quot; (intransitive verb)
*/kʼàhkʼ/ &quot;fire&quot; (noun) or &quot;hot&quot; (adjective) 
*/kʼòk/ &quot;to cut&quot; (transitive verb) or &quot;to be cut&quot; (intransitive verb)
*/mès/ &quot;broom&quot; (noun) or &quot;to sweep&quot; (transitive verb)
*/pùl/ &quot;to pour out&quot; (transitive verb) or &quot;to gush forth&quot; (intransitive verb)
*/tùpʼ/ &quot;to put out/extinguish&quot; (transitive verb) or &quot;to go out/be extinguished&quot; (intransitive verb)
*/tʼìm/ &quot;bow&quot; (noun) or &quot;to stretch a string&quot; (transitive verb)
*/yàk/ &quot;snare&quot; (noun) or &quot;to snare&quot; (transitive verb)
*/ʔùtʃʼ/ &quot;to drink&quot; (transitive verb), &quot;to drink&quot; (intransitive verb), or &quot;louse&quot; (noun)

===Typical phonetic shapes of morphemes===

As is typical of the Mayan languages, the majority of Tzeltal roots are monosyllabic. The basic structure is CVC or CV&quot;h&quot;C, and most longer words can be analyzed in terms of an affixed CVC or CV&quot;h&quot;C root. 
The following forms are the most common, in which C represents any consonant (unless otherwise indicated), and in which V represents any vowel:

===Verbs===

Conjugated verbs include at least a transitive or intransitive theme (formed from either an unaffixed root or a root with derivational affixes), one person marker (if transitive) or two (if intransitive), and an aspectual mark (which can be a zero-mark in the case of intransitive verbs with imperfective aspect). Verbs are also the only part of speech to take aspectual markers. In almost every case, these markers differ between transitive and intransitive verbs, a difference further systematized by the ergative-absolutive case system. Among the affixes shared by both transitive and intransitive verbs are &quot;-el&quot; (derives a verbal noun, similar to an infinitive marker), and the lexical aspect suffixes &quot;-(V)lay&quot; (iterative aspect marker), and &quot;-tilay&quot; (expresses plurality of action). For example, the verb &quot;tam&quot; (&quot;collect&quot;) may be affixed to &quot;tam-tilay-el&quot; (&quot;to collect multiple scattered objects&quot;), and the verb &quot;way&quot; (&quot;sleep&quot;) can be affixed to &quot;way-ulay-el&quot; (&quot;to sleep without waking&quot;). Transitive verbs marked with &quot;-el&quot; are interpreted as having passive voice. To create a transitive, active infinitive, the &quot;-el&quot; suffix is used along with a third-person ergative prefix which must agree with the subject of the verb. Thus, the transitive verb &quot;le&quot; (&quot;look for&quot;) could be affixed as &quot;le-el&quot; (&quot;to be looked for&quot;) and as &quot;s-le-el&quot; (&quot;to look (for something)/looking for something&quot;). Alternatively, a transitive infinitive can be expressed with the suffix &quot;-bel&quot; to the verbal theme; notably, these forms are fully inflected for ergative and absolutive cases. Thus the morphemes in &quot;j-le-bel-at&quot; (&quot;for me to look for you&quot;) correspond to (first-person ergative marker)-&quot;look for&quot;-(infinitive marker)-(second person absolutive marker).

Like many Mayan languages, Tzeltal has affect verbs, which can be thought of as a subcategory of intransitive verbs. They generally function as secondary predicates, with adverbial function in the phrase. In Tzeltal they are often onomatopoeic. Affect verbs have the following characteristics:

# they have their own derivational morphology (the suffixes &quot;-et&quot;, &quot;lajan&quot;, and &quot;C1on&quot; being the most frequent);
# they take the imperfective prefix &quot;x-&quot; but never its auxiliary imperfective marker &quot;ya&quot;, which is usually present with &quot;x-&quot; for intransitive verbs;
# they take the same person markers as intransitive verbs (the absolutive suffixes), but aspect–tense markers appear only in the imperfective; and
# they may function as primary or secondary predicates.

For example, the onomatopoeic affect verb &quot;tum&quot; can function as a primary predicate in describing the beating of one&#x27;s heart: &quot;X-&quot;tum&quot;-ton nax te jk-otʼan e&quot; (essentially, &quot;to me goes &quot;tum&quot; my heart&quot;). As a secondary predicate, an effect verb is typically exhortative, or indicative/descriptive as in the sentence &quot;X-kox-&quot;lajan&quot; y-akan ya x-been&quot; (&quot;his injured leg he walks,&quot; &quot;he limped&quot;).

Tzeltal uses receive, the verb of reception in a kind of periphrastic passive.

===Clitics===

Clitics appear in one of three places in a clause: in the second position (&quot;the Wackernagel position&quot;), in the final position (determined in particular by prosodic and information structures), or immediately following the lexical predicate. There are eight second-position clitics, and several can appear on the same word. When multiple second-position clitics appear, they follow the following order: 
For example, the sentences &quot;Kichʼoj to&quot; (I already have it) and &quot;Ma to kichʼoj&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t have it yet&quot;) both use the second-position clitic &quot;to&quot;.

Certain pairs of second-position clitics may be phonologically altered when appearing consecutively. 
The most common final-position clitic is &quot;=e&quot;. It is typically used in conjunction with the determiner &quot;te&quot;, though the possible semantic outcomes are numerous and governed by complex rules. The remaining four final-position clitics are all deictic: &quot;=a&quot; or &quot;=aː&quot; (distal or adverbial marker), &quot;=to&quot; (proximal marker), &quot;=uːk&quot; (&quot;also&quot;), and &quot;=ki&quot; (exclamative).

Finally, the clitic &quot;=ix&quot; always follows the lexical predicate of a phrase, regardless of the phrase&#x27;s other constituents. Its signification is similar to those of the Spanish word &quot;ya&quot;; it is semantically opposed to the clitic &quot;=to&quot; (&quot;yet&quot;)

==Inflection==
Inflection, typically classified as a subcategory of morphology, describes the ways in which words are modified to express grammatical categories. With regards to verbs it may be called conjugation, and in the case of nouns, pronouns, adjectives and particles it is called declension. In Tzeltal, inflection is most commonly achieved through affixation, though other inflectional processes exist as well.

===Person marking===
The affixes of person marking depend on the case of the verb. In the absolutive case, all person-marking affixes are suffixes:

Use of the &quot;-ik&quot; in the third person plural is optional.

Ergative case is marked with prefixes, each of which has two allomorphs depending on whether the word begins with a vowel or a consonant. Rather than having different prefixes for singular and plural person, the plural is expressed with the addition of a suffix as well as the prefix:

Variation between &quot;k&quot;~&quot;hk&quot; is characteristic of central Tzeltal. Thought often pre-aspirated, the prevocalic second person ergative form is the sole case of a Tzeltal initial vowel not preceded by a glottal stop. The sets of phrases below demonstrate various combinations of person marking, one with the consonant-initial verb &quot;tʼun&quot; (&quot;follow&quot;) and the vowel-initial verb &quot;il&quot; (&quot;see&quot;) (all are in the imperfective aspect, denoted by &quot;ya&quot;).

# ya h-tʼun-at &quot;I am following you&quot;
# ya a-tʼun-on &quot;You are following me&quot;
# ya s-tʼun-otik &quot;He is following us&quot;
# ya h-tʼun-tik-0 &quot;We are following him&quot;
# ya h-tʼun-tik-at &quot;We are following you&quot;
# ya a-tʼun-otik &quot;You are following us&quot; or &quot;you (pl.) are following us&quot;
# ya h-tʼun-tik-ex &quot;We are following you (pl.)&quot;
# ya a-tʼun-on-ik &quot;You (pl.) are following me&quot;
# ya s-tʼun-at-ik &quot;They are following you&quot;
# ya hk-il-at &quot;I see you&quot;
# ya aw-il-on &quot;You see me&quot;
# ya y-il-otik &quot;He sees us&quot;
# ya hk-il-tik-0 &quot;We see him&quot;
# ya hk-il-tik-at &quot;We see you&quot;
# ya aw-il-otik &quot;You see us&quot; or &quot;You (pl.) see us&quot;
# ya hk-il-tik-ex &quot;We see you (pl.)&quot;
# ya aw-il-on-ik &quot;You (pl.) see me&quot;
# ya y-il-at-ik &quot;They see you&quot;

===Aspect marking===
Lacking grammatical tense, Tzeltal makes grammatical aspectual distinctions, using &quot;preverbal auxiliaries&quot; and/or verbal affixes, whereas temporal relations are pragmatically inferred. There are four aspects in Tzeltal: imperfective, perfective, progressive, and perfect. Each aspect is marked differently for transitive and intransitive verbs. Verbs are the only grammatical component able to receive aspect marks in Tzeltal.

====Imperfective====
The imperfective aspect corresponds to an event or action considered as ongoing or unbound. If the action marked as imperfective is understood to be in the present tense, it is generally interpreted as an expression of habit. All verbs can, but do not have to, be marked as imperfective with the auxiliary &quot;ya&quot;, intransitives further requiring the prefix &quot;-x&quot;. In the sentence &quot;Ya x-weʼ-on&quot; (&quot;I eat (habitually)&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m going to eat (now)&quot;), &quot;Ya x-&quot; marks the verb &quot;weʼ &quot; (&quot;to eat&quot;) as both imperfective and intransitive, while &quot;-on&quot; marks both case (absolutive) and person/number (first singular). Compare this to the sentence &quot;Ya j-naʼ &quot; (&quot;I know that&quot;) in which the transitive verb &quot;-naʼ &quot; (&quot;to know [something]&quot;) does not receive &quot;-x&quot; but instead receives, like all transitive verbs, two person/number markers (&quot;j-&quot;, first person ergative, and -Ø, third person absolutive).

In reality the auxiliary &quot;ya&quot; is a reduced form of the imperfective marker &quot;yak&quot;, though variation and conditioning vary greatly across dialects. In the Bachajón dialect it has been morphologically reanalyzed as a prefix (rather than an auxiliary or preverb), but only when the verb is marked for the second-person ergative. Thus, to say &quot;You know that,&quot; speakers from Bachajón may say &quot;Ya k-a-naʼ&quot;, the &quot;-k&quot; occurring as a verbal prefix before person/case marker &quot;a-&quot;, whereas other speakers would prefer &quot;Yak a-naʼ&quot;. The independence of &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;k&quot; in this dialect is shown by the fact that they may be separated by clitics, as in &quot;Yato k-a-naʼ&quot; (&quot;You already know that&quot;: clitic &quot;=to&quot; &quot;already&quot;). Further, in other dialects &quot;ya&quot; is commonly reduced to [i], though not systematically. It is, however, systematically absent after the negation &quot;ma(ʼ)&quot;.

====Perfective====
The perfective aspect is used to present an event as bound or completed. Intransitive verbs do not take any markers in the perfective aspect, and an intransitive verb without aspectual markers is unambiguously understood as perfective. Compare the following two sentences, each with the intransitive verb &quot;bajtʼ&quot; (&quot;go&quot;), the first perfective and the second imperfective:

* &quot;Bajtʼ ta Kʼankujkʼ&quot; (&quot;He went to Cancuc&quot;)
* &quot;Ya x-bajtʼ ta Kʼanjujkʼ&quot; (&quot;He&#x27;s going to go to Cancuc/He will go to Cancuc&quot;)

Transitive verbs in the perfective aspect are marked with the auxiliary preverb &quot;la ~ laj&quot;, the full form &quot;laj&quot; used in the Oxchuc dialect only when the auxiliary appears alone, as an affirmation. This auxiliary historically comes from the intransitive verb &quot;laj&quot; (&quot;finish, die&quot;). Certain other &quot;aspectual&quot; or movement-oriented verbs, such as &quot;tal&quot; (&quot;come&quot;) have similarly become usable as auxiliaries, and when used as such appear without person markers, which appear on the following verb.

Though tense is not morphologically indicated in Tzeltal, the perfective aspect can be used in certain constructions to indicate or suggest location in time. In an independent clause, the perfective verb is almost always understood as having occurred in the past, but can signal either a recent or a distant past. It may correspond to the present tense if the terminating point of the event is understood as the present moment. For example, to announce one&#x27;s immediate departure (&quot;I&#x27;m going (now)&quot;), the verb meaning &quot;go&quot; would be marked for the perfective aspect, even though the social circumstances of such a locution would necessitate that the action not yet be complete. Further, the perfective aspect can indicate a past, habitual action, similar to the English &quot;used to&quot; or &quot;would&quot; (&quot;We used to/would go to the park everyday&quot;). In this construction, adverbs such as &quot;neel&quot; (&quot;before&quot;) may additionally be used for clarity. Lastly, when a perfective clause is topicalized, it may be interpreted as a future factual; in the same context an imperfective clause would be interpreted as a conditional statement, with a lesser degree of factuality and punctuality.

* &quot;Ya sujtʼ-on tel [te me la j-tae] &quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll return [when I find it/when I will have found it]&quot;)
* &quot;[Te me ya jk-ichʼ koltay-ele], ya x-lokʼ ora te atʼele&quot; (&quot;[If you help me (habitually)], the work will go faster.&quot;)

In the above two examples, the first perfective and the second imperfective, the bolded portions correspond to respective aspect markers. The following chart briefly summarizes the above. Note that, in cases in which the auxiliary &quot;ya&quot; disappears, imperfective transitive verbs and perfective intransitive verbs would be marked for aspect in the same way, but recall that the presence of ergative person markers is required for transitive verbs and impossible in the case of intransitive verbs.

====Perfect====
Not to be confused with the perfective aspect, the perfect aspect generally signals the resultant state of an action or event, similar to participles in English. The perfect aspect is always marked with a suffix, which changes between transitive, intransitive, and passive constructions.

For transitive verbs, the allomorph &quot;-oj&quot; follows monosyllabic verb stems, while &quot;-ej&quot; follows polysyllabic verb stems, though the generalization of &quot;-oj&quot; and subsequent disappearance of &quot;-ej&quot; seem to be changes in progress. Observe the following two sentences and their translations, the first with the verb &quot;ichʼ&quot; (&quot;take&quot;) and the second with the verb &quot;tsʼibuy&quot; (&quot;write&quot;):

* &quot;K-ichʼ-oj&quot; (&quot;I have it (with me)&quot;)
* &quot;J-tsʼibuy-ej&quot; (&quot;I wrote it/It&#x27;s written&quot;)

Perfect intransitive verbs take the suffix &quot;-em&quot;, which has an allomorph &quot;-en&quot; following a labial consonant (in Tzeltal, /p, b, w/)

* &quot;Atin-em&quot; (&quot;He washed himself/He is clean&quot;: &quot;atin&quot; &quot;to wash oneself&quot;)
* &quot;Lub-en&quot; (&quot;He tired himself/He is tired&quot;: &quot;lub&quot; &quot;to be tired&quot;)

While verbs in the passive voice are typically conjugated as intransitive (passive transitive verbs taking the suffix &quot;-ot&quot;), passives in the perfect aspect do not take the intransitive suffix &quot;-em&quot; but instead receive a unique suffix, &quot;-bil&quot;. Thus to translate &quot;He is seen&quot; (&quot;il&quot;: &quot;see&quot;) one would say &quot;Il-bil&quot; and not &quot;Il-ot-em&quot;.

Perfect constructions in Tzeltal can also signal a &quot;persistent state,&quot; similar to the function described above but without the necessity that the characterization be the &quot;result&quot; of an action or event. Further, when following the clause-initial predicate &quot;ay&quot;, it is interpreted experientially. If the transitive verb &quot;tiʼ&quot; (&quot;eat [something]&quot;) were marked for the perfect aspect in such a construction, (&quot;Aybal a-tiʼ-oj-ix max?&quot;) it would translate as &quot;Have you ever eaten monkey (&quot;max&quot;)?&quot;

====Progressive====
The progressive aspect typically signals an event or action still occurring when another, more temporally located event took/takes/will take place. It is expressed with the auxiliary &quot;yakal&quot; or its reduced form &quot;yak&quot; together with an infinitive verb construction (of which there are four in Tzeltal). There are two ways to combine &quot;yak(al)&quot; with an infinitive. In the first, the subject is marked by an absolutive suffix on the auxiliary, while infinitive is marked by the preposition &quot;ta&quot;. In the second, which only occurs with inflected transitive infinitives, the auxiliary &quot;yak(al)&quot; is unmarked while the second verb, still in the infinitive, takes person markers:

# &quot;Yak(al)&quot;-[ABSOLUTIVE MARKER]-&quot;ta&quot; [INFINITIVE VERB]
#* &quot;Tulan yak ta okʼ-el te alale&quot; (&quot;The child is currently crying hot tears&quot;)
# &quot;Yak(al)&quot; [ERGATIVE MARKER]-[TRANSITIVE VERB]-&quot;bel&quot;-[ABSOLUTIVE MARKER].
#* Yakal j-koltay-bel-at (&quot;I&#x27;m currently helping you&quot;)

==Syntax==

===Noun phrases===
The following schematic represents the full range of possible elements that may exist in a noun phrase:

[Determiner/demonstrative] [numeral (+classifier)] [adjective(s)] [NOUN] [noun-phrase possessor] [relative clause]

====Determiners and demonstratives====
The initial position of the noun phrase may be occupied by either the determiner &quot;te&quot; (often followed by the final-position clitic, &quot;=e&quot;), or a demonstrative. They behave like proclitics, phonologically joining the following independent word. &quot;Te&quot; serves two functions in the noun phrase, as a marker of both definiteness and grammatical topic. In this sense it is similar to the definite articles in French or Spanish. &quot;Te&quot; is usually used with definite nouns, that is, to reference a contextually identifiable entity (either because it was already mentioned, or because it is present or implicit in a situation) or to reference a unique entity (&quot;the sun, the king&quot;, et cetera). In casual speech, Tzeltal speakers often replace &quot;te&quot; with &quot;i&quot;.

There are two demonstratives, the proximal &quot;ini ~ in ~ i&quot; and the distal &quot;me&quot;, and both are accompanied by the final-position clitic &quot;=to&quot;, which serves a deictic function in reinforcing the act of signaling. They are analogous to the demonstratives &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; in English; for example, &quot;Ya j-mulan ini jun =to &quot; (&quot;I like this book&quot;) and &quot;Ya j-mulan me jun =to &quot; (&quot;I like that book&quot;).

====Numerals====
This position may be occupied by a numeral and classifier, or by a quantifier (analogous to the English &quot;all&quot; or &quot;many&quot;, for example). Various classifiers exist, each associated with a specific semantic domain (for example, &quot;-tul&quot; with humans or &quot;-kojtʼ&quot; with animals). In the absence of a semantically associated classifier, numerals take the general classifier &quot;-eb&quot;, with the exception of the numeral &quot;jun&quot;, &quot;one&quot;. Quantifiers such as &quot;teb&quot; (&quot;a little&quot;) or &quot;bayal&quot; (&quot;a lot&quot;) also appear in this position.

====Adjectives====
One or more adjectives may appear in the position labeled [adjective(s)]. When the adjective serves an epithetical function, it takes the suffix &quot;-Vl&quot;, or &quot;-Vm&quot; with adjectives of color applied to animals, as in the sentence &quot;Le way-al aa te j-kojtʼ mukʼ-ul tiʼwal sak-im tsʼiʼ&quot; (&quot;A ferocious big white dog is sleeping there&quot;: &quot;mukʼ&quot; &quot;big,&quot; &quot;sak&quot; &quot;white&quot;). Nouns can appear in this position when used as a modifier, as in &quot;Tunim chij&quot; (&quot;sheep,&quot; literally &quot;cotton deer&quot;).

====Possession====
If the noun at the head of the noun phrase is possessed by another noun, the possessor noun immediately follows the possessed noun. Possession takes many complex forms in Tzeltal (see Polian 2006, §5.5 for details). Most commonly and simply, it is marked with the prefixes corresponding to transitive verbs marked for ergativity, such that the phrase &quot;John&#x27;s house&quot; would be expressed as &quot;s-na John&quot;, or &quot;his-house John&quot;.

===Order of arguments in a phrase===

Predicates occur phrase-initially; non-final position for predicates is an areal feature. The order of arguments in the phrase is variable, but the most frequent order for transitive phrases is VOS. The relationship between arguments and predicates is mediated by the personal ergative and absolutive affixes, one affix occurring for each argument (though recall that those same affixes are used in other grammatical constructions, such as possession). The systematic appearance of one personal marker per argument means that corresponding arguments need not be realized as noun phrases, but can be implied when corresponding to an unmarked topic. The two following examples illustrate both scenarios:

# &quot;La s-tsʼun ixim te h-bankile&quot;. (&quot;My older brother sowed some corn.&quot;)
# &quot;La s-tsʼun&quot;. (&quot;He sowed it.&quot;)

The &quot;la&quot; marks the verb in the perfective aspect. In both examples, the transitive verb &quot;tsʼun&quot; (&quot;sow&quot;) takes two personal affixes, the third-person ergative prefix &quot;s-&quot; and the third-person absolutive, -Ø. In sentence 1, both because of the semantic nature of the verb meaning &quot;sow&quot; and because VOS is the &quot;unmarked&quot; constituent order, we assume that &quot;ixim&quot; (&quot;corn&quot;) is the object of the verb, and &quot;h-bankile&quot; (&quot;my-older brother&quot;) the subject. In sentence 2, neither the object nor the subject argument appears as a noun phrase; Tzeltal almost never uses pronouns as unmarked topics. The presence of two affixes completes the meaning of the transitive predicate, without the need, as in English, for separate deictic arguments. Because of this paradigm, a transitive verb with both third-person affixes appearing only with one argument (noun phrase) can be ambiguous: &quot;La y-il(-Ø) te achʼixe&quot; (&quot;il&quot;, &quot;see&quot; and &quot;te achʼixe&quot;, &quot;the girl&quot;) could mean either &quot;The girl saw it/him/her,&quot; or &quot;He/she saw the girl,&quot; because the noun phrase &quot;te achʼixe&quot; could be either the subject or object.

However, in the case of passive phrases, the semantic agent may appear unmarked, while the absolutive suffix is preceded by the passive suffix, &quot;-ot&quot;:

&quot;Tiʼ-ot(-Ø) tsʼiʼ te Mikel&quot; (&quot;Mikel was bitten by a dog&quot;; the verb takes only the absolutive person marker -Ø, while, the agent &quot;tsʼiʼ &quot; (&quot;dog&quot;) doesn&#x27;t correspond to an ergative person marker on the verb.)

With ditransitive verbs, marked with the applicative suffix &quot;-b&quot;, the indirect object corresponds to an absolutive marker, while the direct object goes unmarked:

&quot;La h-man-b-at tumut&quot; (&quot;I bought you some eggs&quot;; &quot;man&quot; (&quot;buy&quot;) is marked with the first-person ergative prefix corresponding to &quot;I,&quot; and with the second-person ergative suffix corresponding to &quot;you,&quot; while &quot;tumut&quot; (&quot;egg&quot;) goes unmarked.)

Polian (2006) provides the following table showing the relative frequencies of various constituent orders occurring with transitive, active verbs (in which V represents the verb, A the semantic agent or subject, and P the semantic passive or object):

As the three most frequent constructions omit at least one verbal argument (its presence marked only on the verb itself), it can be said that Tzeltal speakers prefer to omit arguments if they are evident from context.

===Information structure===
Though there is minor disagreement among linguists as to the placement of post-verbal noun phrases, the most recent studies suggest that information structure is the principal factor in determining their order; with few exceptions, noun phrases are arranged in order from the most focalized to the most topicalized. In short, if the semantic agent is the more topicalized element, active voice constructions will take the order VPA (A=semantic active/object, V=verb, P=semantic passive/object), while passive voice constructions take the order Vpas.AP (Vpas.=verb marked for passivity). If the subject is not the more topicalized element, then the active voice will take the form VAP and the passive voice will take the form Vpas.PA.

Both the focus and topic of a phrase can be syntactically expressed with non-verb-initial constructions, though these occur usually as a means to emphasize information rather than as a preferred construction. To topicalize the semantic active/subject, an AVP order is used, with the determinant-clitic circumfix &quot;te...=e&quot; around both the A and P elements. To focalize the subject, the same AVP order is used, except that the determinant circumfix is absent on the A element. To focalize the object, PVA order is used, with the A element circumfixed with &quot;te...=e&quot; and with P unaffixed. If the subject is topicalized and the object is focalized, an APV order is used, with A circumfixed and P unaffixed. Though these are not the only possible orders, it is clear that a focalized element occurring before a verb does not take the determinant &quot;te...(=e)&quot;.

====Topic====
As was stated above, the more topicalized an element is, the more likely it is to be distanced from the predicate. Topic can be morphologically marked in a number of ways. Topicalized elements in the initial position can optionally be preceded by the particle &quot;in&quot;, followed by the determinant &quot;te&quot; or by a demonstrative:

&quot; (In) te k-ijtsʼine tal&quot; (As for) my little brother(, he) came. (&quot;k-ijtsʼin&quot;, &quot;my little brother&quot;, &quot;tal&quot;, &quot;come&quot;)

Further, the particle &quot;jaʼ &quot; may also be used to mark topicalization, also phrase-initially: &quot;&#x27;(Jaʼ) te k-ijtsʼine tal&quot; (As for) my little brother(, he) came. If &quot;jaʼ &quot; is marking a change in topic within a discourse, it is immediately followed by the adverb &quot;xan&quot; (&quot;more&quot;), often reduced in casual speech to &quot;jaʼan&quot;, &quot;jan&quot; or even &quot;an&quot;.

To mark a contrastive topic, as in the English sentence &quot;Michael I saw, but John (on the other hand) I did not,&quot; &quot;yan&quot; (&quot;other&quot;) appears before the contrastive topic (&quot;John&quot; in the example), along with the pronoun &quot;-tukel&quot;: Te Petule, la jk-il; yan te Mikele, ma chiknaj s-tukel. (&quot;I saw Petul, but Mikel, on the other hand, did not appear.&quot;)

====Focus====
Focus in Tzeltal behaves such that noun phrases are more or less focalized depending on their degree of predictability in a given context; noun phrases that are more surprising or unexpected in a given context will be said to be more marked for focus that those which are expected.

===Obviation===
The relative order of a verb and its active and patient arguments, and whether or not a passive construction may be used, can be affected by the definiteness and topicalization of the arguments. When the agent argument is a definite noun (phrase) and the patient argument is indefinite, only the active construction is grammatical. Thus, the Tzeltal equivalent of the phrase &quot;The dog killed a cat&quot; could not be expressed in the passive voice, because the agent &quot;the dog&quot; is definite but the patient &quot;a cat&quot; is indefinite. Inversely, if the patient is definite and the agent indefinite, the passive voice is grammatically required. Whereas an English speaker could say either &quot;A boy hit Michael&quot; or &quot;Michael was hit by a boy,&quot; Tzeltal speakers are obligated to use the passive construct.

<text>Pavlos Melas (; 29 March 1870 – 13 October 1904) was a Greek revolutionary and artillery officer of the Hellenic Army. He participated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and was amongst the first Greek officers to join the Macedonian Struggle.

==Early life and career==
Melas was born in 1870 in Marseilles, France, as the son of Michail Melas who was elected MP for Attica and mayor of Athens and brother of Vassileios Melas, who was also an officer of the Hellenic Army. The Melas family was of Greek &quot;haute bourgeois&quot; descent. His father was a wealthy merchant from Epirus. In 1876, his family moved to Athens. He graduated from the Hellenic Army Academy as an artillery lieutenant in 1891. In 1892, he married Natalia Dragoumi, the daughter of Kastorian politician Stephanos Dragoumis and sister of Ion Dragoumis. In 1895, the couple had a son named Michael and a daughter, Zoe. He became member 25 of the Ethniki Etaireia. Melas participated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. He was an Orthodox Christian.

==Armed action==
Melas, with the cooperation of his brother-in-law Ion Dragoumis, the consul of Greece in the then Ottoman occupied Monastir (now Bitola), Kottas Christou, and Germanos Karavangelis, metropolitan bishop of Kastoria, tried to raise money for the economic support of Greek efforts in Macedonia. After the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising, he decided to enter Macedonia in June 1904, to assess the situation and to see if there is any possibility of establishing a military unit to fight the Bulgarian Komitadjis (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, IMRO) and the Ottoman Turks.

==Death==
In July 1904 (under the alias &quot;Captain Mikis Zezas&quot;, Καπετάν Μίκης Ζέζας), he reentered Macedonia with a small unit of men and fought against the VMRO until 13 October 1904 when he was killed after being surrounded by Ottoman forces in the village of Siatista. News about his death spread in Greek society. In Athens, the Journalists&#x27; Union of Daily Newspapers organised a memorial service to honour him, which was attended by 100,000 people. Schools and shops were closed, and numerous flags, mourning ribbons and portraits of him were set up. The village in which he was killed has been renamed Melas in his honour, after joining Greece. After his death, Greek efforts were intensified, resulting in more resources being dedicated for Macedonia by the Greek government. The efforts were aimed at weakeaning Bulgarian military influence.

==Legacy==
He is considered to be a national hero of the Macedonian Struggle. Many of his personal belongings can be seen in the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in Thessaloniki and Pavlos Melas Museum in Kastoria. A bust of him was made on his cenotaph at Kastoria, commissioned by his wife and co-funded by the municipality in 1920, with the inscription calling him &quot;first martyr for Macedonian liberty&quot;.

His granddaughter Natalia Mela was a distinguished sculptor.

<text>The Gyeongju Basin is a landform in Gyeongju city, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea. It forms part of the watershed of the Hyeongsan River, which flows north through the basin where it is joined by the Bukcheon, Namcheon, Daecheon, and Sogyeon-cheon streams.

The basin is surrounded by low mountains, most of which are also part of Gyeongju National Park. Specifically, it is bordered by Gowi Mountain (495 m above sea level) on the south, Seondo Mountain (380 m) and Ongnyeo Peak (215 m) on the west, and Gumi Mountain (594 m) on the north. Namsan, a mountain composed of two peaks (466 m, 495 m), cuts the Gyeongju Basin into two parts at the southern end. The streams that flow from these mountains have formed a number of interlinked alluvial plains in the Basin.

The city center of Gyeongju, which was also the capital of the ancient Silla kingdom, occupies much of the basin. Various watershed management projects were undertaken even during Silla times, due to continuous flooding in the basin, caused by runoff from the neighboring mountains combined with inflow from the upper Hyeongsan River watershed. The most recent severe flood took place in 1991.

The basin is also home to a great number of important Korean cultural heritage assets, mostly related to its ancient role as capital of Silla. For example, the royal tombs of Silla are located there, as is the Gyerim forest. The slopes of the entire Namsan Mountain are covered in religious and ceremonial sites dating from the Mumun Pottery Period (c. 1500-300 B.C.) to the end of the Korean Three Kingdoms (c. AD 668). Namsan and environs is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Agriculture is also undertaken on a significant scale within the basin. The crops are primary staples such as rice, barley, and soybeans. The Gyeongju strain of rice grown here is particularly famous for its quality. However, the Gyeongju Basin has undergone significant environmental strain since the 1970s resulting the construction of tourist facilities, the expansion and industrialization of urban Gyeongju, intensive agriculture, and the construction and use of national public infrastructure such as expressways, highways, and high-speed rail.

<doc id="1204899" wikidata="Q36809" url="?curid=1204899" title="Tzotzil language">
<text>Tzotzil (; ) is a Maya language spoken by the Indigenous Tzotzil Maya people in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Some speakers may be somewhat bilingual in Spanish, but many are monolingual Tzotzil speakers. In Central Chiapas, some primary schools and a secondary school are taught in Tzotzil. Tzeltal is the most closely related language to Tzotzil and together they form a Tzeltalan sub-branch of the Mayan language family. Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Chʼol are the most widely spoken languages in Chiapas besides Spanish.

There are six dialects of Tzotzil with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility, named after the different regions of Chiapas where they are spoken: Chamula, Zinacantán, San Andrés Larráinzar, Huixtán, Chenalhó, and Venustiano Carranza. &quot;Centro de Lengua, Arte y Literatura Indígena&quot; (CELALI) suggested in 2002 that the name of the language (and the ethnicity) should be spelled Tsotsil, rather than Tzotzil. Native speakers and writers of the language are picking up the habit of using &quot;s&quot; instead of &quot;z&quot;. 

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Tzotzil has five vowels.

Before a glottalized consonant, a vowel appears to lengthen and tense, such as &quot;a&quot; in &quot;takʼin&quot; &quot;money&quot;.

===Consonants===
 is frequently implosive , especially in intervocalic or in initial position. It is also weakly glottalized in initial position.

 are more strongly aspirated in final position.

 occur but only in loanwords.

Aspirated and ejective consonants form phonemic contrasts: kok, kokʼ and kʼokʼ all have different meanings: (&#x27;my leg&#x27;, &#x27;my tongue&#x27; and &#x27;fire&#x27;, respectively).

===Syllable structure===
All words in Tzotzil begin with a consonant, which may be a glottal stop. Consonant clusters are almost always at the beginning of a word, with a prefix and a root. Roots in Tzotzil occur in the forms CVC (&quot;tʼul&quot; &quot;rabbit&quot;), CV (&quot;to&quot; &quot;still&quot;), CVCVC (&quot;bikʼit&quot; &quot;small&quot;), CV(C)VC (&quot;xu(v)it&quot; &quot;worm&quot;, the second consonant disappears in some dialects), CVC-CVC (&quot;ʼajnil&quot; &quot;wife&quot;), CVCV (&quot;ʼama&quot; &quot;flute&quot;) or CVC-CV (&quot;voʼne&quot; &quot;long ago&quot;). The most common root is CVC.

Almost all Tzotzil words can be analyzed as a CVC root together with certain affixes.

===Stress and intonation===
In normal speech, stress falls on the first syllable of the root in each word, and the last word in a phrase is heavily stressed. For words in isolation, primary stress falls on the final syllable except in affective verbs with &quot;-luh&quot;, first person plural exclusive suffixes, and reduplicated stems of two syllables. Then, the stress is unpredictable and so is indicated with an acute accent. The Tzotzil variant of San Bartolomé de Los Llanos, in the Venustiano Carranza region, was analyzed as having two phonemic tones by Sarles 1966. Research by Heriberto Avelino in 2009 was not able to confirm more than an unstable and incipient tone contrast.

===Phonological processes===
* When intervocalic, /b/ is pre-glottalized and when it is followed by a consonant, b becomes a voiced m preceded by a glottal stop. In final position, b becomes a voiceless m preceded by a glottal stop so &quot;tzeb&quot; &quot;girl&quot; is pronounced .
* When adding an affix results in double fricative consonants, only one is pronounced so xx, ss, nn, or jj should be pronounced as x [ʃ], s.[s], n [n], or j [h]. For example, &quot;ta ssut&quot; &quot;He is returning&quot; is pronounced [ta sut] . Other double consonants are pronounced twice, like tztz or chch, in verbal construction or in words with the same two consonants appearing in conjoining syllables: &quot;chchan&quot; &quot;He learns it&quot; is pronounced [tʃ-tʃan].
* s changes to x when prefixed to a stem beginning with ch, chʼ, or x.
* x changes to s when prefixed to a stem with an initial or final tz or s.

==Morphology==
In Tzotzil, only nouns, verbs, and attributives can be inflected.

===Nouns===
Nouns can take affixes of possession, reflexive relation, independent state (absolutive suffix), number, and exclusion, as well as agentives and nominalizing formatives. Compounds can be formed in three ways:
*nominal root+nominal root &quot;jol-vitz&quot; &quot;summit&quot; (head-hill)
*verbal root+nominal root &quot;kʼat-in-bak&quot; &quot;inferno&quot; (to burn-bone)
*attributive root/particle+nominal root &quot;unen-vinik&quot; &quot;dwarf&quot; (small-man)

An example of a prefix for nouns is &quot;x-&quot;, an indicator of a non-domesticated animal: &quot;x-tʼel&quot; &quot;large lizard&quot;

The plural suffixes for a noun change based on whether or not the noun is possessed:
*&quot;-t-ik, -ik&quot;. Plural suffix for possessed nouns, linked with possessive prefixes: &quot;s-chikin-ik&quot; &quot;his/her/their ears&quot;, &quot;k-ichʼak-t-ik&quot; &quot;our fingernails&quot;
*&quot;-et-ik&quot;. Plural suffix for non-possessed nouns: &quot;vitz-et-ik&quot; &quot;hills&quot;, &quot;mut-et-ik&quot; &quot;birds&quot;
*&quot;-t-ak&quot;. Plural suffix for objects that come in pairs, or when it is necessary to indicate the plural of both the noun and the possessor: &quot;j-chikin-t-ak&quot; &quot;my (two) ears&quot;, &quot;s-bi-t-ak&quot; &quot;their names&quot;

Some nouns, such as words for body parts and kinship terms, must always be possessed. They cannot be used without a possessive prefix, or otherwise must be used with an absolute suffix to express an indefinite possessor. The possessive prefixes are:

The prefix listed first is the one used before a root starting with a vowel, the prefix listed second is the one used before a root starting with a consonant. For example, k+ok &quot;kok&quot; &quot;my foot&quot;, j+ba &quot;jba&quot; &quot;my face&quot;

The absolute suffix is usually &quot;il&quot; but can also have the form &quot;el&quot;, &quot;al&quot;, or &quot;ol&quot;: &quot;kʼob-ol&quot; &quot;hand (of some unspecified person)&quot;

===Verbs===
Verbs receive affixes of aspect, tense, pronominal subject and object and formatives of state, voice, mood and number. They can also form compounds in three ways:
*verb+noun &quot;tzob-takʼin&quot; &quot;to raise money&quot;
*verb+verb &quot;mukul-milvan&quot; &quot;to murder&quot;
*attributive+verb &quot;chʼul-totin&quot; &quot;to become a godfather&quot;

===Attributives===
Attributives are words that can function as predicates, but are neither verbs nor nouns. Often they can be translated into English as adjectives. Unlike verbs, they do not inflect for aspect, and unlike nouns, they cannot head a noun phrase or combine with possessive affixes. The composition of attributives occurs in three ways:
*verbal root+noun &quot;maʼ-sat&quot; &quot;blind&quot; (negative-eye)

For colors:
*attributive of color+verbal root+formative &quot;-an&quot; &quot;shadow, shade (of color)&quot; &quot;kʼan-setʼ-an&quot; &quot;shade of yellow&quot;
*attributive of color reduplicated+t-ik &quot;type of plural&quot; &quot;tzoj-tzoj-t-ik&quot; &lt; &quot;tzoj&quot; &quot;red&quot; This construction implies intensity in the color.

==Syntax==
The basic word order of Tzotzil is VOS (verb-object-subject). Subjects and direct objects are not marked for case. The predicate agrees in person, and sometimes in number, with its subject and direct object. Non-emphatic personal pronouns are always left out.

===Verb agreement===
Since the agreement system in Tzotzil is ergative-absolutive, the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb are marked by the same set of affixes, while the subject of a transitive is marked with a different set of affixes. For example, compare the affixes in the following sentences:
*l- i- &quot;tal&quot; -otik &quot;We (inclusive) came.&quot;
*ʼi j- &quot;pet&quot; -tik lokʼel ti vinik -e &quot;We (inclusive) carried away the man.&quot;

In the first sentence, the intransitive verb &quot;tal&quot; (&quot;come&quot;) is affixed by -i-...-otik to show that the subject is the 1st person plural inclusive &quot;we,&quot; but in the second sentence, since the verb &quot;pet&quot; (&quot;carry&quot;) is transitive, it is affixed by j-...-tik to mark the subject as the 1st person plural inclusive &quot;we.&quot;
*l- i- s- &quot;pet&quot; -otik &quot;He carried us (inclusive)&quot;

From this sentence we can see that the 1st person plural inclusive object &quot;us&quot; is being marked the same as the 1st person plural inclusive intransitive subject &quot;we&quot; using -i-...-otik. Thus, -i-...-otik is the absolutive marker for 1st person plural inclusive and j-...-tik is the ergative marker for 1st person plural inclusive.

Also from the sentence l- i- s- &quot;pet&quot; -otik &quot;He carried us (inclusive)&quot; it is possible to see the 3rd person ergative marking s-, which contrasts with the 3rd person absolutive marking Ø in the sentence ʼi- &quot;tal&quot; &quot;He/she/it/they came.&quot;

===Enumeration===
With many nouns, numbers must be compounded to numeral classifiers that correspond to the physical nature of the object being counted. This precedes the noun being counted. For example, in &quot;vak-pʼej na&quot; &quot;six houses&quot; the classifier &quot;-pʼej&quot; &quot;round things, houses, flowers, etc.&quot; is compounded to the number &quot;vak&quot; &quot;six&quot; and precedes the noun &quot;na&quot; &quot;house(s).&quot;

==Sample lexicon==
There are also many Spanish loanwords in Tzotzil, such as:
* rominko &lt; &quot;domingo&quot; &quot;Sunday&quot;
* pero &lt; &quot;pero&quot; &quot;but&quot;
* preserente &lt; &quot;presidente&quot; &quot;president&quot;
* bino &lt; &quot;vino&quot; &quot;wine&quot;

==Dictionaries and grammars==
In 1975, the Smithsonian Institution produced a dictionary of Tzotzil, containing some 30,000 Tzotzil-English entries, and half that number of English-Tzotzil entries, the most comprehensive resource on Tzotzil vocabulary to that date. Tzotzil word-lists and grammars date back to the late 19th century, most notably in Otto Stoll&#x27;s &quot;Zur Ethnographie der Republik Guatemala&quot; (1884).

== Liturgical use ==
In 2013, Pope Francis approved translations of the prayers for Mass and the celebration of sacraments into Tzotzil and Tzeltal. The translations include &quot;the prayers used for Mass, marriage, baptisms, confirmations, confessions, ordinations and the anointing of the sick ... Bishop Arizmendi said Oct. 6 that the texts, which took approximately eight years to translate, would be used in his diocese and the neighboring Archdiocese of Tuxtla Gutiérrez. Mass has been celebrated in the diocese in recent years with the assistance of translators — except during homilies — Bishop Arizmendi said in an article in the newspaper &quot;La Jornada&quot;.

==Media==
Tzotzil-language programming is carried by the CDI&#x27;s radio stations XEVFS, broadcasting from Las Margaritas, Chiapas, and XECOPA, based in Copainalá, Chiapas.

<text>Sverre Helge Hassel (30 July 1876 – 6 June 1928) was a Norwegian polar explorer and one of the first five people to reach the South Pole.

== Biography ==
Sverre Hassel was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. As soon as he was old enough, he went to sea, earning his mate&#x27;s certificate. Between 1898 and 1902, Hassel participated on board the &quot;Fram&quot; in Otto Sverdrup&#x27;s attempt to circumnavigate Greenland.
Along with Helmer Hanssen, Hassel was picked as an expert dog driver to take part in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition 1910–1912. On 14 December 1911, Hassel together with Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Olav Bjaaland and Oscar Wisting were the first to reach the South Pole. For his participation in the expedition, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (&quot;Sydpolsmedaljen&quot;), the Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition.

Hassel was constable of the Maritime Military Corps in 1904 before he was hired as an assistant at the customs authorities in Kristiansand. In 1922, Hassel became customs inspector and office manager in Grimstad. Sverre Hassel died in 1928 during a visit to Amundsen&#x27;s home in Svartskog.

== Legacy ==
* Mount Hassel: peak at the northeasternmost summit of the massif at the head of Amundsen Glacier, in the Queen Maud Mountains in Antarctica.
* Hassel Sound: strait between Amund Ringnes Island and Ellef Ringnes Island in northern Canada
* Cape Sverre: northernmost point on Amund Ringnes Island, which he circumnavigated in 1900
* Hassel was portrayed by Erik Hivju in the 1985 television serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;, and by Kenneth Åkerland Bergas in the 2019 film &quot;Amundsen&quot;.

== Sources ==

Roald Amundsen wrote about the expedition in &quot;Sydpolen&quot; published in two volumes in 1912–1913.
The work was translated from the Norwegian into English by A. G. Chater, and published as &quot;The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the &quot;Fram,&quot; 1910–1912&quot;

<doc id="1204915" wikidata="Q1970197" url="?curid=1204915" title="Swingarm">
<text>A swingarm (or swinging arm), originally known as a swing fork or pivoted fork, is a single or double sided mechanical device which attaches the rear wheel of a motorcycle to its body, allowing it to pivot vertically. The main component of the rear suspension of most modern motorbikes and ATVs, it holds the rear axle firmly, while pivoting to absorb bumps and suspension loads induced by the rider, acceleration, and braking.

Originally motorcycles had no rear suspension, as their frames were little more than stronger versions of the classic diamond frame of a bicycle. Many types of suspension were tried, including Indian&#x27;s leaf spring suspended swingarm, and Matchless&#x27;s cantilevered coiled-spring swingarm. Immediately before and after World War II, the plunger suspension, in which the axle moved up and down two vertical posts, became commonplace. In the latter, the movement in each direction was against coiled springs.

Some manufacturers, such as Greeves, used swingarm designs for the front forks, which were more robust than telescopic forks. In particular, sidecar motocross outfits frequently use swingarm front forks. The swingarm has also been used for the front suspension of scooters. In this case it aids in simplifying maintenance. In motorcycles with shaft drive, such as the Yamaha XJ650 Maxim, the shaft housing forms the left side swingarm.

==Swingarm types==
Swingarms can be single or double sided, and have appeared in a variety of geometries. Many single-sided also incorporate the driveshaft.

Swinging fork - the original version consisting of a pair of parallel pipes holding the rear axle at one end and pivoting at the other. A pair of shock absorbers are mounted just before the rear axle and attached to the frame, below the seat rail.

Cantilever - An extension of the swinging fork where a triangulated frame transfers swingarm movement to compress shock absorber/s generally mounted in front of the swingarm. The HRD-Vincent Motorcycle is a famous early form of this type of swingarm, though Matchless used it earlier, and Yamaha subsequently. The Harley-Davidson Softail is another form of this swingarm, though working in reverse, with the shock absorbers being extended rather than compressed.

Parallelogram - Was first introduced commercially in 1985 on the Magni &quot;Le Mans&quot;. Magni called the system &quot;Parallelogrammo&quot;. Various parallelogram systems have been developed by other manufacturers.

Whereas downward generated mechanical forces would cause a chain-driven bike to &quot;squat&quot; at the rear under acceleration, the torque reaction of a shaft drive machine would induce the opposite, causing the seat (and rider) to rise upwards, a phenomenon known as &quot;shaft-jacking&quot;. This anti-intuitive sensation can be disconcerting to riders, which parallelogram suspensions seek to neutralize.

BMW introduced its &quot;Paralever&quot; system on its 1988 R80GS and R100GS motorcycles, which adds a second link between the rear drive and transmission to allow the driveshaft to pivot along the same axis as the sprung rear frame. 

Moto Guzzi patented its &quot;Compact Reactive Drive Shaft&quot; system (Ca.R.C.), where the driveshaft is free to float into its structure, providing much softer feedback from transmission. An upper arm serves as a guide to close the geometry of the suspension.

Extended swingarms - are often used by drag racing motorcycles (called dragbikes) to keep their center of gravity as forward as possible, which reduces the tendency to wheelie at the start.
Single-sided swingarm - a suspension lying along only one side of the rear wheel, allowing it to be mounted to a hub like a car wheel. Also found on scooters, where a robust chain case doubles as the swingarm linking the engine and rear wheel, single-sided swingarms need to be much stiffer and more heavily built than double-sided, to accommodate the extra torsional forces. Having a single mounting point guarantees proper wheel alignment.

Single-sided swingarms date from at least the late 1940s. In 1948, the Imme R100 produced by Norbert Riedel of Germany had both a single-sided front wheel suspension as well as a single-sided rear swingarm that doubled as the exhaust pipe. In 1950 Moto Guzzi introduced the Galletto, a large-wheel step-through scooter. In 1980, BMW introduced its first single-sided swingarm on the R80G/S, the &quot;Mono-lever&quot;, which was superseded by the &quot;Para-lever&quot; used currently. Honda currently features this style of swingarm on the Honda VFR. Ducati has created several models featuring single swingarms, most notably the Massimo Tamburini-designed 916 series. While Ducati abandoned this style for the 999, the company returned to it for the 1098 superbike in 2007, and it survives in the current Ducati 1199. The Triumph Sprint ST and Speed Triple also feature single-sided swingarms.

===Images===
==Squat and shaft-jacking==

&quot;Squat&quot; occurs because the top of the final drive chain run pulls the swingarm upwards; &quot;shaft-jacking&quot; occurs because the shaft drive bevel gear tries to &quot;climb up&quot; the large bevel gear in the wheel hub, thereby pushing the swingarm downwards and away from the frame.

Shaft-jacking can be minimised by devices such as parallelogram swingarms. A practical way to minimise squat on a chain-drive bike is to locate the final drive sprocket as close as possible to the axis of the swingarm pivot; the ideal solution is to make the final drive sprocket and the swingarm pivot concentric, as was done on the Hesketh V1000.

<text>The Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) is a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Until 2011 it was known as the Football Licensing Authority, having been set up under the Football Spectators Act 1989. The SGSA was established through the Sports Grounds Safety Authority Act 2011, which received royal assent in July 2011 and commenced on 1 November 2011.

The aim of the SGSA is to ensure that all spectators regardless of age, gender, ethnic origin, disability, or the team that they support are able to attend sports grounds in safety, comfort and security.

==Creation==

The Football Licensing Authority was originally conceived as the body that would implement the Football Membership Scheme in response to the disaster at the Heysel Stadium in 1985. However, the Government shelved this in the light of Lord Justice Taylor&#x27;s Final Report on the Hillsborough disaster of April 1989.

Instead it was eventually charged with implementing some of the Report&#x27;s key recommendations by:

* monitoring local authorities&#x27; oversight of spectator safety at international, Premiership and Football League grounds
* and ensuring through a system of licensing that these grounds became all seated.

In 1992 the Government of the United Kingdom decided to allow clubs in the Football League Second and Third Divisions to retain some standing accommodation, provided that this satisfied certain criteria. The FLA enforced this through their licensing scheme.

==Key objectives==

The FLA had agreed the following key objectives with the United Kingdom Government:

* To ensure by means of guidance, assistance and monitoring that the local authorities perform their functions to a consistent and acceptable standard; and, in the long term, to give these authorities the opportunity to reduce their level of involvement as clubs take greater responsibility for safety.
* To maintain and build on the achievements of the government&#x27;s policies on spectator accommodation.
* To bring about, through advice and persuasion, a permanent change of culture whereby consistently high standards of safety are maintained at every Premiership, Football League and international football ground by the clubs or ground management taking responsibility on their own initiative rather than in response to requirements imposed by other bodies.
* To maintain and enhance its position as the leading authority on ground safety and standards both at home and overseas and as the prime source of advice and assistance to the government, local authorities, clubs and other bodies.

==Wider role==

In December 1998, following a major review, the Government of the United kingdom announced that the FLA would in due course become the Sports Grounds Safety Authority. It presented legislation to this effect to Parliament but the 2001 General Election intervened. Ministers were committed to reintroducing it when they could find a place in the Parliamentary timetable, but failed to do so.

Although the formal role of the FLA was limited to professional football grounds, they did respond to requests for general advice and information in relation to other sporting venues – where the issues and needs are often the same.

==Change from Football Licensing Authority to Sports Grounds Safety Authority==

On 14 October 2010 it was announced that the FLA was one of the 192 Quangos to be axed by Her Majesty&#x27;s Government, with its expertise and functions transferred to another body. On 12 July 2011 the Sports Grounds Safety Authority Act 2011 received royal assent. The Act transformed the Football Licensing Authority into the Sports Grounds Safety Authority. On 10 November 2014 it was announced that the Sports Grounds Safety Authority will be retained as an Independent body.

<text>The Opposite Of Sex is a 1998 American independent romantic dark comedy written and directed by Don Roos, in his directorial debut, starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan and Lisa Kudrow. It marked the final film produced by Rysher Entertainment. Shortly before the film’s world premiere at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, it was acquired by Sony Pictures Classics. The tagline: &quot;You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll be offended.&quot;

==Plot==
16-year-old Dedee Truitt runs away from home. She is pregnant by her ex-boyfriend, Randy Cates. Not revealing her pregnancy, Dedee eventually moves in with her much older half-brother Bill, a gay teacher in a conservative, suburban community in St. Joseph County, Indiana.

Although he is living with Matt, Bill still mourns the loss of his previous partner, Tom, who died of AIDS some time ago. Bill maintains a friendship with Tom&#x27;s younger sister, Lucia, who idolized her brother.

Dedee seduces Matt, then tricks him into believing he has impregnated her. They elope, leaving Bill and Lucia to track them down.

Bill and Lucia find Dedee and Matt in Los Angeles, only to discover Dedee has stolen Tom&#x27;s ashes and is holding them for ransom. Randy also finds her; they inform Matt that they are taking the ashes and moving away. They escape but soon get into an argument that leads to Dedee&#x27;s accidentally shooting Randy. She and Matt escape to Canada.

Lucia and Bill have a falling out after she implies that Tom died as a result of having gay sex. Despondent, she has a one-night stand with Sheriff Carl Tippett, who had previously made unsuccessful romantic overtures to her. Lucia later discovers that she is pregnant.

Bill eventually tracks down Matt and Dedee. She goes into labor and Bill accompanies her into the delivery room. After giving birth to her son, Dedee returns Tom&#x27;s ashes to him, apologizing for her actions in the past year.

Dedee ends up serving time in prison, leaving her son in Bill&#x27;s care while she&#x27;s incarcerated. After a few months, she moves back in with him, while Matt goes traveling, and Lucia gives birth to her own child. Eventually, Dedee decides that her son would be better off with Bill, who is now dating Dedee&#x27;s parole officer.

Dedee sarcastically concludes that sex is precisely the opposite of what people should want, leading as it does to kids, disease or, worst of all, relationships. At the end of the film, the vignettes of the various caring relationships among the characters show the &quot;opposite&quot; of superficial sexual gratification.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot; was shot from June to July 1997 in Los Angeles, California. It was to be the last theatrical work produced by Rysher Entertainment, who shut down their film unit the same month that shooting wrapped. Sony&#x27;s arthouse division Sony Pictures Classics distributed the film.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
&quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot; was given a limited theatrical release on May 22, 1998. Its opening weekend saw a per screen average of $20,477 for the 5 theaters showing it.

=== Critical response ===
Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;gleefully acerbic comedy&quot;. Christina Ricci&#x27;s performance was widely praised and she received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Roger Ebert especially enjoyed the voice-over narration supplied in-character by Ricci, calling it &quot;refreshing&quot; and comparing it to &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;:

When you&#x27;ve seen enough movies, alas, you can sense the gears laboriously turning, and you know with a sinking heart that there will be no surprises. The Dede character subverts those expectations; she shoots the legs out from under the movie with perfectly timed zingers. I hate people who talk during movies, but if she were sitting behind me in the theater, saying all of this stuff, I&#x27;d want her to keep right on talking.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 81% approval rating based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot; smartly lightens a bitter story with sharp insights and strong dialogue - as well as a startlingly mature performance from former child actor Christina Ricci.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

Director Don Roos has been noted for his depiction of sexual fluidity, which features in &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot; as well as other Roos films such as &quot;Happy Endings&quot;. Judith Kegan Gardiner took a less sanguine view of this feature in the book &quot;Masculinity Studies and Feminist Theory&quot;. Gardiner described &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot; as representative of a &quot;fairly repulsive genre of films&quot; that feature a &quot;heterosexual conversion narrative&quot; that is &quot;set in motion by the desire of a heterosexual person for a seemingly unattainable gay person.&quot;

The American Film Institute nominated the film for its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs list.

<text>MiKTeX is a free and open-source distribution of the TeX/LaTeX typesetting system compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It also contains a set of related programs. MiKTeX provides the tools necessary to prepare documents using the TeX/LaTeX markup language, as well as a simple TeX editor, TeXworks. The name comes from the login credentials of the chief developer Christian Schenk, MiK for Micro-Kid.

MiKTeX can update itself by downloading new versions of previously installed components and packages, and has an easy installation process. By default, MiKTeX installs only a minimal set of packages (according to the philosophy of &quot;just enough TeX&quot;), which is useful in case of the limited space. It will then ask users whether they wish to download any packages that have not yet been installed but are required to render the current document. A portable version of MiKTeX, as well as a command-line installer of it, are also available.

The latest version of MiKTeX is available at the MiKTeX homepage. In June 2020, Schenk decided to change the numbering convention; the new one is based on the release date. Thus 20.6 was released in June 2020. Since version 2.7, MiKTeX has support for XeTeX, MetaPost and pdfTeX and compatibility with Windows 7. Support for 32-bit computers was dropped in 2022 and for Windows 7 in 2023.

<text>Donald Paul Roos (born April 14, 1955) is an American screenwriter and film director.

==Life and career==
Roos was born in upstate New York into a conservative Roman Catholic family of mostly Irish descent. He attended the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. After graduating, Roos moved to Los Angeles, where he pursued a television screenwriting career.

Roos supported himself by working as a word processor, and to this day jokes that he has that as a fall-back plan. Roos began his writing career when he had a friend of his impersonate an agent and represent him; a phone call led to a job with playwright Mart Crowley (&quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;), who at the time was an executive producer of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;. Roos wrote for &quot;The Colbys&quot;, &quot;Nightingales&quot;, and other TV shows, before his spec scripts led to feature film writing assignments. His first major film was 1992&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated &quot;Love Field&quot;, an interracial drama starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Dennis Haysbert.

Roos&#x27;s work as the writer of the film &quot;Single White Female&quot; has earned him a permanent space in Hollywood movie trivia, since that title has entered the lexicon in reference to the film&#x27;s psychopathic lead character who begins to take on her roommate&#x27;s identity.

Roos is well known for his work writing strong and engaging female characters, a skill that has also been useful in his film direction, leading to Independent Spirit Award nominations for actors Lisa Kudrow, Christina Ricci and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Roos himself has won a Best First Feature Independent Spirit Award, for &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot;. Roos has polished or written the screenplay to many high-profile studio films, sometimes as uncredited script doctor.

With his husband - actor, writer, and film producer Dan Bucatinsky - he has two children, Eliza and Jonah.

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, he was the first to map the structures of carotenoid pigments, including astaxanthin, rubixanthin and canthaxanthin.

==Personal life==
Weedon was born in Wimbledon, his father was a dentist and his mother came from a family of prosperous jewellers. His parents separated when he was nine years old and he remained living with his father, within a few years he had lost all contact with his mother and his younger sister.

During World War II, he was evacuated to a farm near Guildford. His wife, Barbara Dawe, served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Navy Service during World War II, whilst working there she met Basil&#x27;s cousin and later Basil. They married in 1959 and had two children, Sarah and Matthew. Weedon suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his later years.

==Academic life==
He attended Wandsworth Grammar School in South London, then a school in Guildford, prior to studying chemistry at Imperial College, London in 1940. He was awarded his degree just two years later, aged 19. He remained at Imperial College, studying for a PhD before taking a job with ICI working on dyes in Blackley, Manchester. He returned to Imperial College in 1947 as a lecturer in organic chemistry and became a reader in 1955. In 1960 he was appointed the Chair of organic chemistry at Queen Mary College. In 1976 he became the 4th Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, a position he held until his retirement in 1988. He was a consultant to Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland between 1955 and 1978.

==Scientific discoveries==
Weedon, in collaboration with L. M. Jackman, was the first to use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the structures of carotenoids. He also worked on the synthesis of carotenoids and in 1953 described the synthesis of methylbixin which was produced by exposing bixin from &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; to iodine; later he successfully synthesised bixin using the Wittig reaction. During the 1960s and 1970s, Weedon&#x27;s research group elucidated the structures of and synthesised a wide range of naturally occurring carotenoids. These included, canthaxanthin (responsible for the pink colour of flamingos), astaxanthin (responsible for the colour of lobsters), capsanthin and capsorubin (found in red peppers), renieratene (from Japanese sea sponges) and fucoxanthin (the most abundant carotenoid found in seaweed). Other compounds whose structures were discovered include alloxanthin, mytiloxanthin, decaprenoxanthin and violerythrin.

==Honours and awards==
*1952 - Meldola Medal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry
*1971 - Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
*1974 - Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire

<doc id="1204969" wikidata="Q7851242" url="?curid=1204969" title="Tudhoe">
<text>Tudhoe is a village in the civil parish of Spennymoor, in County Durham, England. It lies just outside Spennymoor, a short distance to the west of the Great North Road. Tudhoe lay at the centre of a network of roads: one ran to Durham by way of Sunderland Bridge and Croxdale, another to Kirk Merrington, a third to Bishop Auckland, a fourth to Whitworth and Byers Green, and a fifth across a ford to Brancepeth Castle and village on the far side of the river. All except the Brancepeth road are shown on the 1768 map of County Durham by Thomas Jefferys.

Tudhoe is now dwarfed by Spennymoor, an industrial town that grew up around the Tudhoe iron works in the 19th century. The modern town of Spennymoor lies only a few fields from Tudhoe, but the contours are such that it cannot be seen from most of the village, and Tudhoe today gives the impression that it is still an isolated country village.

For most of its history, Tudhoe has been in the parish of Brancepeth. The parish church of St Brandon&#x27;s, dating from the 16th century, was one of the finest village churches in County Durham until its destruction by fire in 1998. Brancepeth lies across the River Wear from Tudhoe; there has never been a bridge, and the ford was not an easy one. In winter, it was often impassable, and Tudhoe baptisms, weddings and burials then took place at Whitworth. Because of this, Tudhoe was always seen (from Brancepeth) as an isolated outpost. Tudhoe&#x27;s own Anglican churches, Holy Innocents and St David&#x27;s, were not built until 1866 and 1880, respectively, though there is a large Catholic church, dedicated to St. Charles Borromeo, which was founded in 1858.

Tudhoe was renowned as a mining village until the end of the 20th century. Until the closure of the mines, the wealthy Colliery Masters took up residence in a grand mansion known as The Loggins, which stands in several acres of its own land and overlooks the area.

== Governance ==
Tudhoe was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Brancepeth, in 1866 Tudhoe became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and merged with Spennymoor. In 1931 the parish had a population of 6865.

<text>Arisaema is a large and diverse genus of the flowering plant family Araceae. The largest concentration of species is in China and Japan, with other species native to other parts of southern Asia as well as eastern and central Africa, Mexico and eastern North America. Asiatic species are often called cobra lilies, while western species are often called jack-in-the-pulpit; both names refer to the distinctive appearance of the flower, which consists of an erect central spadix rising from a spathe.

==Classification and relationships==
The closest relatives of &quot;Arisaema&quot; appear to be &quot;Pinellia&quot; and &quot;Typhonium&quot; (although the latter as defined in 2004 seems to be paraphyletic, having given rise to &quot;Arisaema&quot; and other genera). One unusual trait shared by all &quot;Arisaema&quot; species, and not those of other genera, is the &quot;sex change or act of Sequential hermaphroditism.&quot; &quot;Arisaema&quot; plants are typically male when small, and female or hermaphroditic when large, with a single plant capable of changing sex based on nutrition and genetics, and perhaps changing sex several times during its long life (20 years or more).

===Sections===
A phylogenetic study in 2016 by Ohi-toma et. al recognized 15 sections in the genus.
==Species==
:&quot;See: List of Arisaema species&quot;
Plants of the World Online accepts around 212 accepted species .

<doc id="1204981" wikidata="Q2907131" url="?curid=1204981" title="The Timekeeper">
<text>The Timekeeper (also known as From Time to Time and Un Voyage à Travers le Temps) was a 1992 Circle-Vision 360° film that was presented at three Disney parks around the world. It was the first Circle-Vision show that was arranged and filmed with an actual plot and not just visions of landscapes, and the first to utilize Audio-Animatronics. The film featured a cast of European film actors from France, Italy, Belgium, Russia, and England. The film was shown in highly stylized circular theaters, and featured historic and futuristic details both on the interior and exterior.

&quot;The Timekeeper&quot; and its original European counterpart &quot;Le Visionarium&quot; marked the first time that the Circle-Vision film process was used to deliver a narrative story line. This required a concept to explain the unusual visual characteristics of the Theater, hence the character Nine-Eye. Nine-Eye was sent through Time by The Timekeeper, so that she could send back the surrounding images as she recorded them in whichever era she found herself in.

The European attraction was also known by its film name as &quot;Un Voyage à Travers le Temps&quot;, while the Japanese version was simply named &quot;Visionarium&quot;, with the caption &quot;From Time to Time&quot; on the poster. The American Film Theater was known as &quot;Transportarium&quot; for a period of six months after it debuted, but the name was later dropped in lieu of &quot;Tomorrowland Metropolis Science Center&quot;, or formally &quot;The Timekeeper&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Le Visionarium&quot; (the original title) was the first Circle-Vision 360° film in which Imagineers wanted to tell an immersive story and attempt a light-hearted dialogue, without just switching between scenes of landscapes, as had been done in all of the previous Circle-Vision films.

The original concept for the film had included Jules Verne and the culture of past and present European history and events, and new inventions. Along with the previous elements, the story had to do with the idea of Time Travel with one concept including a child that explored the story of the great European scientists of the past on an intelligent computer. However, to keep the audience focused and use imagination to depict situations and places that do not cater to the average person, the number of visions of the past and extreme situations of the plot kept increasing all the time for the project.

The film first premiered in Discoveryland at Disneyland Paris on April 12, 1992, as &quot;Le Visionarium&quot;. It was an extravagant attraction, and was touted by then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner as the showcase attraction of the land at the time. However, TIME Magazine derided the film as a &quot;flop&quot; of a &quot;wan drama&quot; in its review of Disneyland Paris. The next year, the third incarnation of the ride opened at Tokyo Disneyland, as part of that park&#x27;s 10th Anniversary Celebration.

The attraction had long been on the &quot;Discoveryland USA&quot; proposal for the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort. However, when financial difficulties arose because of the EuroDisney Project, this Discoveryland project was canceled. At one point, the attraction was to be extended into a restaurant featured next door to the attraction. The Plaza Pavilion was to receive a makeover as the &quot;Astronomer&#x27;s Club&quot;, where a stage would have featured actors portraying famed scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, or Galileo, who would appear in the restaurant, and then be called back to the past by either Nine-Eye or Timekeeper.

However, the film was named &quot;From Time to Time&quot; and opened in the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s Circle-Vision Theater, rechristened &quot;Transportarium&quot; on November 21, 1994, as part of the New Tomorrowland expansion. Six months later, the attraction underwent some name changes. The Theater was renamed &quot;Tomorrowland Metropolis Science Center&quot;, and the film was formally known as &quot;The Timekeeper&quot;.

In 2001, the attraction was moved to the seasonal list of attractions along with Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress due to the September 11 attacks. In February 2006, the Walt Disney World Resort reported that &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; was to be closed on February 26, 2006. Walt Disney World&#x27;s version was the last version of the attraction to be closed. Both the Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris &quot;Visionarium&quot; films had closed in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

==Pre-show synopsis==
===European pre-show===
Guests were ushered into a dimly-lit library-like chamber, complete with several artifacts, such as models of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Nautilus&quot; from &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; and &quot;Albatross&quot; from &quot;The Clipper of the Clouds&quot;, Da Vinci&#x27;s flying machine, or the first balloon ever created. A short movie about the history of Renault making cars is shown (until this company dropped its sponsorship in 2002). Guests were introduced to Timekeeper, who told them they were about to join him in an experimentation by viewing his last and greatest invention: his extraordinary machine to explore Time. Before he introduced it, he gave a short speech on how his machine would change the world just as the ones that surrounded guests in the pre-show room. He even sang briefly about visionaries. After that, he introduced the crowd to &quot;Nine-Eye&quot;, and explained how she would travel through Time first and let guests see this through her eyes. Guests then watched Nine-Eye&#x27;s training videos, which included a plunge over Niagara Falls, a flight into a barn full of dynamite in Topeka, Kansas, a swirling ride aboard a centrifugator, and lastly, hitching a ride on a space shuttle.

===Japanese pre-show===
This pre-show scene was similar to the European version, however with some differences. Instead of the dark circular enclave as in the Paris location, a bright open area was present. The wall that separated the building from the Tomorrowland corridor was a large stained-glass mural featuring 22 famous inventors and visionaries. Also featured was the Timekeeper&#x27;s study, library, and laboratory. The pre-show area also featured a 20-foot model of Da Vinci&#x27;s Heliocentric Solar System, the &quot;Nautilus&quot; from Verne&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, the &quot;Albatross&quot; from Verne&#x27;s &quot;The Clipper of the Clouds&quot;, a real 1920s film projector from Walt Disney Pictures, and an actual copy of Verne&#x27;s novel, &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. This location&#x27;s film focused on Verne and H.G. Wells, explaining how their work changed history. Then, Nine-Eye was introduced to guests.

===American pre-show===
Before the actual show, guests were introduced to the invention of the show, &quot;Circumvisual PhotoDroid&quot;, more frequently referred to as &quot;Nine-Eye&quot;. The nine eyes she had represented the nine cameras used in filming the show in the round, thus showing the view from one of her &quot;eyes&quot; on each of the nine movie screens. She was the latest development by The Timekeeper, the inventor of the Time Machine. Guests were invited to be witnesses of the first use ever of the newly invented Machine. Guests also watched Nine-Eye&#x27;s training videos, which included a plunge over Niagara Falls, a flight into a barn full of dynamite in Topeka, Kansas, and lastly, hitching a ride on a Space Shuttle.

==Attraction synopsis==
===The film===

After guests entered the Theatre, Timekeeper (voiced by Robin Williams) came to life and had Nine-Eye prepared for the journey through Time. Timekeeper then turned on the Machine for its first use, then watched from his control panel as Nine-Eye was thrust back to the Jurassic age period in Earth&#x27;s history. She narrowly escaped a hungry Allosaurus as Timekeeper sent her to the last great ice age about 12,000 years ago. As she started freezing up, Timekeeper sent her to 1450, for what should have been a demonstration of Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s Printing Press.

However, Timekeeper messed up and sent her to a Scottish battlefield in which one warrior came after her. Finally once the kinks of the Time Machine got worked out, Timekeeper sent Nine-Eye to the year 1503, at the height of the Renaissance. The Machine was placed right in the middle of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s workshop, where he was painting the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and working on a model of his Flying Machine. Nine-Eye, being curious, picked up an item close to her, and was quickly noticed by Leonardo, who became fascinated by the strange machine, and started drawing it on paper.

However, the meeting between Nine-Eye and Da Vinci was cut short. Her next stop in Time was 1763 in a French castle, where a child named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart gave a musical performance to a crowd, which included King Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. The meeting was once again cut short as she was noticed by the people, who started chasing her through various hallways. Timekeeper then decided to send her to the 1878 Exposition Universelle, but the Machine was stuck on fast forward, so she witnessed a Paris skyline in such a motion that the progress of the Eiffel Tower, the symbol of the 1889 Exposition Universelle, was shown in the background. Finally Timekeeper had the Machine stopped in 1900, just in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle.

Timekeeper announced that guests were just in time for a meeting between H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. Nine-Eye hid from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells were hidden. After a brief conversation about their conflicting visions of the Future, Wells walked away, leaving Verne with a model of his Time Machine, which Verne had just criticized as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, Nine-Eye rebutted his claim and appeared to the author. Jules Verne decided to take a closer look at her and tried to grab her. Timekeeper, seeing this, tried to bring her back to the present, but accidentally took Verne as well.

Timekeeper and Nine-Eye, realizing their mistake, tried to send him back, but he refused after discovering he had finally arrived in the future he had always dreamed of. He begged for them to show him the world of the present in 10 minutes or less, so he could return to 1900 and deliver his speech at the Exhibition (which made Timekeeper ironically reply that he did it in 80 days). They agreed, and Timekeeper set the Machine for the present date. He sent Verne and Nine-Eye to a dark tunnel, which Verne believed to be a &quot;dark future&quot;. They were unaware they were standing in a railroad tunnel. The next thing to happen was a collision between Jules Verne and a French TGV train, with Verne becoming a new hood ornament.

From the train, Jules Verne and Nine-Eye explored the modern streets of Paris (with Verne walking among the traffic, nearly causing an accident), which led Verne, curious, to try driving. As such, Timekeeper put him in the front seat of a race car, and Verne took off, albeit in the wrong direction. Verne then enjoyed a bobsled run. After this bobsled run, Timekeeper sent Verne and Nine-Eye to the bottom of the sea to show Verne how his 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; came to life.

The scene then changed, going from being underwater to flying. Jules Verne now stood in a balloon soaring over Red Square in Moscow, sharing it with a Russian couple on their honeymoon. Since Verne&#x27;s presence was inconvenient, Timekeeper sent him to Roissy Airport near Paris. The two Russian lovers were accidentally taken to Paris as well, where they could start their honeymoon. As Verne witnessed planes (the &quot;flying wagons&quot; as he called them), he begged for Timekeeper to let him fly. An employee soon arrived, discovered Nine-Eye, and started talking to her. However, Verne, who ventured far from there, was arrested by policemen. With the help of the employee and Timekeeper&#x27;s grip on time, Verne was freed (these two scenes were not part of Orlando&#x27;s version).

The screen then showed a flight through the air above various European countrysides featuring castles and mountains. Verne was shown in a helicopter, sitting dangerously close to its open door. After flying over Mont Saint-Michel, Neuschwanstein Castle, various scenes of the English countryside, and New York City&#x27;s skyline (only in Orlando&#x27;s version), Verne requested to go even higher. They took him to space, in order to show that another dream of his, space travel, had come true from his book &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.

Time began to run out, so Timekeeper and Nine-Eye returned Verne to the site of the Grand Palais of the 1900 Exposition Universelle. However, Timekeeper made one mistake in the wrong year; Verne being in the right place, but at the wrong time, in the 1990s (the present day when the attraction opened). When they finally returned Verne to 1900, H.G. Wells happened to go back to the site of his discussion with Verne, and therefore saw all that went on with the Timekeeper. Wells was flabbergasted, and Verne and Nine-Eye exchanged goodbyes as Wells struggled to understand what just happened. Nine-Eye returned to the present time, and now that guests had witnessed a &quot;flawless&quot; demonstration of his Time Machine, Timekeeper decided to send Nine-Eye into the future along with a few guests that volunteered to travel with her.

Timekeeper then sent Nine-Eye and selected guests to 2189, 300 years after the Exposition Universelle of 1889 and the completion of the Eiffel Tower (both evidenced by the Timekeeper&#x27;s clock and by the appearance of the number &quot;300&quot; on the Eiffel Tower). As they explored a futuristic Paris aboard a flying car named &quot;Reinastella&quot;, they saw Jules Verne and H.G. Wells appearing in what looked like Wells&#x27; Time Machine from 1900. A stunned Nine-Eye questioned how they got there, to which Verne replied, &quot;In the future, anything is possible!&quot;. The show ended as they jetted off, and Timekeeper wished everyone well. As guests left, Timekeeper made plans to see other important events in history and in the future with his Machine and Nine-Eye.

==Film variations==
The original European version of the film was different from the American version. A certain number of scenes were cut including the hot air balloon scene, some European coastline scenes, and a dialogue between Jules Verne and an employee of Paris&#x27; Charles de Gaulle Airport. The only addition in the American version was a New York City skyline scene. The hot air balloon scene was filmed over Red Square in Moscow, and as such taken under intense conditions by Walt Disney Productions in the then-Soviet Union.

==Aftermath and the Effects of September 11, 2001==
After being placed on a seasonal schedule in April 2001, &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; at Walt Disney World was open on a sporadic schedule during the busy seasons. Some attribute it to the following criticisms, which the overseas versions of the attraction had not been faced with:
* Guests may have found it hard to stand or strainful on the eyes
* The lack of familiar Disney characters
* The building&#x27;s entrance was very inconspicuous and did not feature a large rotating globe icon or full title.

After the events of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the attraction faced even harder times, due in part to a general decline in tourism due to the terrorist acts. The fact the film featured a scene of New York that still included the now-destroyed World Trade Center prompted a change that saw the Timekeeper&#x27;s clock in this segment register the &quot;current year&quot; as 2000, removing any mentions of the towers from the attraction.

However, the attraction lasted five more years. During the time when construction was occurring on Stitch&#x27;s Great Escape!, it was open more frequently along with Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress. On days when the show was not opened, the queue was a meet-and-greet for Disney characters such as Stitch and Pixar characters Buzz Lightyear, and Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone from &quot;The Incredibles&quot;.

Until February 2006, &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; in Walt Disney World Resort was the last &quot;Timekeeper&quot; still operating, as the Tokyo Disneyland version closed in 2002 and was replaced with Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Astro Blasters in 2004, and the Disneyland Paris version closed in 2004 and was replaced by Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast in 2006, although the Disneyland Paris version closed mainly because it lost its sponsor, Renault.

In early 2007, the former location of &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; became home to Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor. The attraction building still retains most of the elements of the previous tenant, including the water columns in the queue and the basic Circle-Vision theater. However, the Theater floor has been modified to include seating and several of the screens are now covered by other elements.

==Failed proposal for the Disneyland Resort==
During the early 1990s, then Disney-Executive, Michael Eisner released ambitious plans for changes to the parks. &quot;Tomorrowland 2055&quot; was planned for a remake of Tomorrowland and the Disneyland Resort in California. &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; was to be a showcase attraction, along with ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter and Plectu&#x27;s Fantastic Intergalactic Revue. One promotional brochure had Delta Air Lines sponsoring the film. These plans were later scrapped due to financial difficulties within the Parks &amp; Resorts division, most stemming from the billion dollar losses incurred with the EuroDisney project. However, some clips of &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; could be seen in the queue for &quot;Rocket Rods&quot;, which utilized the Circle-Vision 360° Theater.

Other information placed Visionarium as an opening-day attraction at the unbuilt park next to Disneyland, WestCOT. The show would have been housed in a European Renaissance building in a European section of the WestCOT version of World Showcase. However, like the &quot;Tomorrowland 2055&quot; plan, this did not occur either.

==Soundtrack notes==
===Audio dialogue===
The three versions of the attraction featured a soundtrack of dialogue in each park&#x27;s country&#x27;s native tongue (French, Japanese, and English).

Both the Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris versions featured guest-selectable translations on headset, which included :
* For Paris :
** English
** German
** Spanish
** Italian
** Dutch
* For Tokyo :
** English
** Mandarin Chinese

Since both the European and Japanese versions opened before Orlando&#x27;s version was created, the voicecast and dialogue are completely different. The American-style dialogue was not present in these versions, and it was a close translation of the French dialog.

===Featured music===
* While the American version received a different soundtrack from the other versions, they were both scored by Bruce Broughton.
* During the scene of the conversation between Verne and Wells at the Exposition Universelle, the song heard in the background is called Estudiantina, or &quot;Band of Students Waltz&quot;. It was composed in 1883 by Émile Waldteufel.
* When Verne returns to the Exhibition building in the 1990s, &quot;Motownphilly&quot; by Boyz II Men can be heard in the background. It was meant to represent popular music at the time of filming. The song can be found on their 1991 debut album &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot;.

==Foreign language titles==
* French: &quot;Le Visionarium&quot;
* Japanese: ビジョナリアム – &quot;Visionarium&quot;

==Renault&#x27;s involvement with the film==
The French automobile company Renault is heavily featured throughout the attraction, since it sponsored it in Europe between 1992 and 2002.
* In the film :
** In the scene where Jules Verne steps off the curb into a busy street in front of the Arc de Triomphe, the car that almost hits him is a five-door hatchback, Renault Clio, at the time of filming the newest model in Renault&#x27;s fleet of cars.
** In the Formula 1 scene, where Jules Verne drives a race car, he is seated and drives the Renault F1 vehicle.
** The flying car carrying a family in the scene of Paris in the future was imagined by Renault and is called a &quot;Reinastella&quot;.
* In front of the building in Paris :
** A Reinastella model was displayed near the entrance, but it was removed in 2002, when Renault dropped sponsorship. However it remained in the final scene of the film. The prototype car was then seen around Europe in auto shows, most recently on display at Renault&#x27;s showroom on the Champs-Élysées.
** When the prop sat outside the theater, a plaque beneath it read :

&quot;Blast into the Future by checking out the Renault Reinastella! The Reinastella&#x27;s futuristic design features a vocal command system that makes steering wheels and accelerators a thing of the past. With a cruising height that ranges from to above surfaces, the Reinastella flies up to . The next time you&#x27;re traveling through time, stop into the 24th century and test drive a Renault Reinastella!&quot;

<text>Frank Michler Chapman (June 12, 1864 – November 15, 1945) was an American ornithologist and pioneering writer of field guides.

==Biography==
Chapman was born in the West Englewood section of present-day Teaneck, New Jersey, and attended Englewood Academy. He joined the staff of the American Museum of Natural History in 1888 as assistant to Joel Asaph Allen. In 1901 he was made associate Curator of Mammals and Birds and in 1908 Curator of Birds.

Chapman came up with the original idea for the Audubon Christmas Bird Count. He also wrote many ornithological books such as, &quot;Bird Life&quot;, &quot;Birds of Eastern North America&quot;, and &quot;Life in an Air Castle&quot;. Chapman promoted the integration of photography into ornithology, especially in his book &quot;Bird Studies With a Camera&quot;, in which he discussed the practicability of the photographic blind and in 1901 invented his own more portable version of a blind using an umbrella with a large &#x27;skirt&#x27; to conceal the photographer that could be bundled into a small pack for transport along with the other, at the time very bulky, paraphernalia of the camera gear. For his work, &quot;Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia&quot;, he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1917. He was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1921.

Chapman fathered one child, Frank Chapman, Jr., who first married playwright Elizabeth Cobb and had a daughter, actress and TV personality Buff Cobb, and after divorcing married mezzo-soprano opera singer Gladys Swarthout.

Chapman was interred at Brookside Cemetery.

== The Legacy of &quot;Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia&quot; ==
Published in 1917, &quot;Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia&quot; collated data and records from Chapman and the American Museum of Natural History’s eight ornithological expeditions into Colombia. These expeditions, like others in the 1910s, emphasized the collection of avian specimens as the predominant form of data collection. Chapman and his team from the American Museum of Natural History collected 15, 775 avian specimens from their expeditions, along with 1,600 mammal specimens.

Later ornithological expeditions in the 1950s would expand their methods of data collection to include observational data, in addition to specimen collection. A resurgence of interest in Colombian aviary biodiversity, fueled by concerns of deforestation and changes in climates, led to more surveys in the 1990s and 2010s. These resurveys of the San Antonio mountain ranges further changed their methodology to favor observational data, citizen observational data, and mist netting.

The Colombia Resurvey Project is a collective of researchers who began reproducing Frank Chapman’s original expeditions in 2020. The goals of this project according to its website is “to document the current status and past changes of bird assemblages and their habitats throughout the country, and to establish a quantitative, publicly-available database for future assessments and monitoring”.  The surveys carried out in this project have expanded upon the methodology of studies from the 2010s, incorporating citizen training and citizen-led data collection. Additional modifications to the project’s resurveys included decolonial practices such as emphasizing and crediting local contributors and sharing information gained from the studies to support long term conservation efforts in the study’s vicinity. Another all-women expedition led by members of the Resurvey project occurred in 2020. This project was reportedly inspired by the team member&#x27;s rediscovery of Elizabeth Kerr&#x27;s contributions to Chapman&#x27;s and the American Museum of Natural History’s collections. Letters between Kerr and Chapman owned by the American Museum of Natural History suggest that Elizabeth Kerr was the first women to partake in ornithological expeditions in Colombia, and made significant specimen contributions to the museum&#x27;s collections. These specimen were often identified by Chapman himself, and in some instances included newly identified species. One such species, the Choco tinamou (&quot;Crypturellus kerriae)&quot;, was named in her honor by Chapman.

<text>Miguel Ángel Blanco Garrido (13 May 1968 – 13 July 1997) was a Spanish economist and municipal politician and a member of the People&#x27;s Party, in Ermua, the Basque Country. He was kidnapped and murdered by the Basque separatist group ETA.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Miguel Ángel Blanco Garrido was born on 13 May 1968 in Ermua (Biscay) into a humble family. He had a sister, María del Mar. His father, Miguel Blanco, was a construction worker and his mother, Consuelo Garrido, was a housewife. They were Galician immigrants from Xunqueira de Espadanedo (Ourense, Galicia). Consuelo died on 1 April 2020 from coronavirus, three weeks after her husband&#x27;s death.

Miguel Ángel Blanco graduated in economics at the Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea in Sarriko. For a long time he worked with his father in construction, but he found work at Eman Consulting, in Eibar, where he commuted to every day by train. He also played the drums in the bands Póker and Cañaveral. He was a sports fan and his dream was to walk to Madrid to protest against the possible closure of the Ermua&#x27; sports centre. He joined the youth-wing of the People&#x27;s Party, Nuevas Generaciones, in 1995 and, due to it being a relatively small party in the area where the national parties compete against the PNV, he was the third candidate for the municipal elections in that year. Nevertheless, under the proportional system, he won enough votes to become a member of the town&#x27;s council.

===Kidnapping and death===
On 10 July 1997, Blanco was kidnapped by ETA on his way to see a client. They threatened to assassinate him unless the Spanish Government started transferring all ETA prisoners to prisons in the Basque Country within 48 hours. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in demonstrations throughout Spain, demanding his release, but 50 minutes after the deadline expired, at 16:50 on 12 July, he was shot in the back of the head. Shortly thereafter, he was found on the outskirts of San Sebastián, with his hands tied, dying. He died in the hospital at 4:30 a.m. on 13 July. He is interred in Faramontaos, A Merca, with his parents.

===Repercussions===
Blanco&#x27;s kidnapping and death had a deep social impact throughout Spain, including the Basque country, and, in an unprecedented move, even some of ETA&#x27;s own supporters publicly condemned the killing. The &quot;Spirit of Ermua&quot; was born at this time as was the anti-terrorist organization Foro de Ermua and the Fundación Miguel Ángel Blanco.

2006 saw the beginning of the trial of his kidnappers and murderers, Francisco Javier García Gaztelu (&quot;Txapote&quot;) and his girlfriend, Irantzu Gallastegi (&quot;Amaia&quot;). Another kidnapper, José Luis Geresta Mujika, committed suicide two years after Blanco&#x27;s murder.

<text>If You Want Blood You&#x27;ve Got It (written as just If You Want Blood) is the first live album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, and their only live album released during Bon Scott&#x27;s lifetime. It was originally released in the UK and Europe on 13 October 1978, in the US on 21 November 1978, and in Australia on 27 November 1978. The album was re-released in 1994 on Atco Records and in 2003 as part of the &quot;AC/DC Remasters&quot; series.

==Background==
The album was released six months after the band&#x27;s previous studio album &quot;Powerage&quot;. A &#x27;best-of&#x27; package called &quot;12 of the Best&quot; had been in the works, but the project was scrapped in favour of a live album. It was recorded during the 1978 &quot;Powerage&quot; tour and contains songs from &quot;T.N.T.&quot;, &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;, &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, and &quot;Powerage&quot;. It is the last Bon Scott-era AC/DC album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, who also produced the band&#x27;s first five studio releases.

In his 1994 Bon Scott memoir &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, author Clinton Walker observes, &quot;Live albums, which tended to be double or triple sets in which songs short in their studio versions were stretched out into extended tedium, were for some reason popular in the seventies. &quot;If You Want Blood&quot; reversed this tradition... it boasted a blunt ten tracks and, allowing nothing extraneous, got straight to the point, that being raging AC/DC rock and roll.&quot;

A concert at the Apollo Theatre in Glasgow, Scotland on 30 April 1978 was used for the live tracks. The concert is also remembered for the encore, when AC/DC came back on stage dressed in the Scottish football strip, paying homage to Scott&#x27;s and the Young brothers&#x27; homeland. 

&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, performed on the night, was removed from the album release, while the encore – &quot;Fling Thing/Rocker&quot; – was edited, removing &quot;Fling Thing&quot; and cutting out Angus&#x27;s extended solo, as he did a walk around the audience (with an early version of a wireless guitar lead). This part of the band&#x27;s concert theatrics later accompanied &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;; &quot;Rocker&quot; has been performed only a few times since Bon Scott&#x27;s passing in 1980. The live &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; was released as the b-side of the single &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; in November 1978, but only in Australia. It was rereleased worldwide in 2009 on the two (standard) and three (collectors) CD boxed set compilation &quot;Backtracks&quot;, featuring Australian-only songs not released internationally at the time, and live b-Sides from 7&quot; and 12&quot; singles. The encores &quot;Fling Thing&quot; and &quot;Rocker&quot; (with a complete guitar solo) appeared only on footage of the concert by a Dutch TV station played at the time, but were eventually released on the &quot;Family Jewels&quot; DVD.

According to the 2006 book &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, the album title was an extension of Scott&#x27;s response – at the Day on the Green festival in July 1978 – when a journalist asked what they could expect from the band. The singer replied, &quot;Blood.&quot; The cover art is from a shoot with Atlantic Records&#x27; staff photographer Jim Houghton after the show at Boston&#x27;s Paradise Theater on 21st August 1978, the idea for which came from Atlantic&#x27;s art director Bob Defrin. The front cover depicts Angus Young being impaled on stage with a guitar during a performance, while the back depicts a bloodied Young lying facedown on the same stage, though deserted.

A song titled &quot;If You Want Blood (You&#x27;ve Got It)&quot; appeared on the next album: the band&#x27;s US chart breakthrough, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;.

==Reception==
The album was listed at #2 on &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers&#x27; poll of &quot;50 Greatest Live Albums Ever&quot;. In a 1992 interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; at the time of the band&#x27;s second live release, Malcolm Young admitted, &quot;I personally still prefer the old album. We were young, fresh, vital and kicking ass.&quot; Greg Prato of AllMusic notes, &quot;While most other rock bands of the era were busy experimenting with disco or creating studio-perfected epics, AC/DC was one of the few specializing in raw and bluesy hard rock, as evidenced by 1978&#x27;s live set, If You Want Blood You&#x27;ve Got It.&quot; Eduardo Rivadavia of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; enthuses, &quot;Other concert records may boast more songs, more Top 40 hits or even more crowd-pleasing gimmicks. But very few can challenge the sheer excitement and reckless abandon captured on AC/DC’s terrific concert document.&quot; Carlo Twist of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine praised the album, saying that &quot;They were always a mighty live act, and this is the sound of AC/DC in Europe just prior to 1979&#x27;s U.S. breakthrough. The audience&#x27;s hysteria regularly cuts through the amps, as they howl along to singer Bon Scott&#x27;s tale of sexually transmitted disease (&quot;The Jack&quot;) and punctuate guitarist Angus Young&#x27;s staccato riffing on &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie.&quot; Imagine a punk-rock Chuck Berry played at nosebleed volume.&quot;

==Concert footage==
The entire Glasgow concert was filmed but the complete footage has never been released. Eventually, &quot;Riff Raff&quot; and &quot;Fling Thing/Rocker&quot; segments were made available on the DVD &quot;AC/DC Family Jewels&quot;, released in 2005. Video footage was also used from the show on &quot;Family Jewels&quot; using the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot; studio version audio track promotional clip. Segments from the concert (the songs &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot;, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;) were made available on the DVD &quot;Plug Me In&quot;, released in 2007 (the latter 2 were also released on YouTube in 2013)). &quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot; was included on the bonus disc on the three-disc edition of &quot;Plug Me In&quot;.

== Track listing ==

===Original concert setlist===
All songs written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott except &quot;Fling Thing&quot;, which is a Scottish traditional song.
Notes
* The song &quot;Gimme a Bullet&quot; was played during sound-check, according to the Official Apollo Theatre website setlist for the show.
* &quot;Fling Thing&quot; is the b-side to the original Australian only single of &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, but is actually the traditional Scottish folk song &quot;The Bonnie Banks o&#x27; Loch Lomond&quot;. The band played it live in Australia and Scotland as a staple part of the encores in the early years, and is replayed on the 1991 album &quot;AC/DC Live&quot; 2 CD Collectors edition from the Glasgow concert on the Razors Edge World Tour (though this time it is just called &quot;Bonny&quot;) and it was re-released in its original form, for the first time since 1976, on the &quot;Backtracks&quot; boxed set.
* This version of &quot;Fling Thing / Rocker (reprise)&quot; - as it was the encore for the concert - is on the &quot;Family Jewels&quot; DVD, with some of the other songs from this concert, but the entire show has never been seen in its entirety since an original broadcast by a Dutch TV station around the same era.

<text>Bidford-on-Avon is a large village and civil parish in the English county of Warwickshire, very close to the border with Worcestershire. In the 2001 census it had a population of 4,830, increasing to 5,350 at the 2011 census, increasing again to 6,818 in the 2021 census.

==History==

The Roman road Ryknield Street passes through the village, going north towards Alcester. The road crossed the Avon at what in Anglo-Saxon times, became known as Byda&#x27;s Ford, which was the origin of the village&#x27;s name. There is an ancient Anglo-Saxon burial site under the free car park located just behind the Indian restaurant &quot;No 72&quot;. First discovered in the 1920s, artefacts from more recent excavations are located at Warwick Museum, while material from the first excavations on the site currently resides in the hands of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. A Bronze Age razor was found in excavations at Bidford-on-Avon. 

William Shakespeare is said to have joined a party of Stratford folk which set itself to outdrink a drinking club at Bidford-on-Avon, and as a result of his labours in that regard to have fallen asleep under the crab tree of which a descendant is still called Shakespeare&#x27;s tree. When morning dawned his friends wished to renew the encounter but he wisely said &quot;No I have drunk with “Piping Pebworth, Dancing Marston, Haunted Hillboro’, Hungry Grafton, Dodging Exhall, Papist Wixford, Beggarly Broom and Drunken Bidford” and so, presumably, I will drink no more.&quot; The story is said to date from the 17th century but of its truth or of any connection of the story or the verse to Shakespeare there is no evidence. The Falcon Inn was a favourite tavern in his day.

Bidford expanded roughly fourfold in size during the second half of the 20th century.

==Location==
Bidford-on-Avon village is, as its name suggests, situated on the River Avon, some downstream of Stratford-upon-Avon and about the same distance upstream of Evesham. The village grew up around an ancient ford (Byda&#x27;s Ford), now replaced by a narrow stone bridge, on the Ryknild Street Roman road, now a minor country road to Honeybourne, south. To the north Alcester is about away, Redditch away and Birmingham away. It also lies on the Heart of England Way.

==Local government==
Bidford-on-Avon is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It falls within the areas of Stratford-on-Avon District Council and Warwickshire County Council. The three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government. Besides the village of Bidford itself, the civil parish includes the settlements of Barton, Broom and Marlcliff. Broom lies to the north of Bidford, whilst both Barton and Marlcliff lie south of the river.

== Bidford Community Library ==
When Warwickshire County Council took the decision to close the Bidford Library in April 2012, a Social Enterprise company was formed. The Library officially reopened on 2 May 2012, by children&#x27;s author Anne Fine. The library was fully refurbished in Spring 2018, thanks to funding provided by a Section 106 Planning Obligation.

==Transport==

The river is crossed by Bidford Bridge, which is a scheduled monument. During the week beginning Monday 26 November 2012, the Bridge had to be closed, due to flooding, when the River Avon burst its banks in various places. On 9 June 2015, the bridge was closed to traffic after a heavy duty farm vehicle crashed into it, causing serious damage to the historic structure. Police cars were positioned either side of the bridge to alert drivers to the fact that the bridge was inaccessible to traffic. After repairs, the bridge re-opened.

Bidford no longer has an active railway line, but it once had a station on the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway, which ran east–west across the county from on the Midland Railway&#x27;s to line, through to and beyond. The Broom to Stratford section (including and also ), was an early casualty, with passenger services suspended in June 1947 and closure rubber-stamped as permanent in May 1949. The line itself remained open with the south curve of Broom Junction until at least 1952. Today the closest station to Bidford, is Honeybourne railway station, which is located south of the village. Honeybourne station provides regular rail services to London Paddington, , , and along the Cotswold Line.

==Churches==
The Anglican parish church is dedicated to St. Laurence. St. Joseph the Worker Church is the local Roman Catholic church. The Barn is the home of Bidford Baptist Church. Bidford also has a Methodist church.

==Twinning village==

Bidford is twinned with Ebsdorfergrund, a village close to Marburg in Rheinhessen, Germany.

==Notable people==

*Barbara Comyns (1907–1992), writer and artist.
*Fred Wilkes (1883–1942), professional footballer

<text>Three vessels of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Vidette&quot;:

* was a 14-gun sloop, previously a cutter. She was purchased in 1782 and sold in 1792. She became the privateer cutter &quot;Thought&quot;, which the French captured in 1793. She became a French privateer and sailed under various names until captured as &quot;Vedette&quot; in 1800. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS &quot;Vidette&quot;, but sold her in 1802, never having commissioned her.
* was a Grimsby trawler of , named &quot;Ulverston&quot;, launched in 1905, and hired between 1916 and 1919. She was armed with one 12-pounder gun and served as a minesweeper. She was named &quot;Vidette II&quot; in February 1917. The Navy hired her again in February 1943 as a fuel carrier and renamed her &quot;Outpost&quot; in March. It returned her to her owners in 1945.
* was an Admiralty V-class destroyer. Built at the end of the First World War, she served in the final months of that conflict, and saw extensive service in the inter war years and in World War II. She was an effective convoy escort and U-boat killer, being credited with the destruction of five U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic.</text><links>

<text>Palmoxylon (petrified palmwood) is an extinct genus of palm named from petrified wood found around the world.

== Fossil record ==
This genus is known in the fossil record from the Late Cretaceous to the Miocene (from about 84.9 to 11.6 million years ago). Fossils of species within this genus have been found in Germany, Italy (Sardinia), United States, Egypt, Libya and Argentina (Bororó and Salamanca Formations). Many species were described from the Deccan Traps in India.

== Distribution ==
A number of species from the Cretaceous and Cenozoic have been described from the Patagonia region of South America. There have been a number of species reported from Egypt which are dated to the Late Eocene and Early Miocene.

Specimens from the Oligocene epoch (34 - 23 mya) can be collected from many scattered sites in east Texas and western Louisiana. Fossils found near fossil palmwood include corals, sponges, and mollusks, indicating that the palms grew along prehistoric beaches. For millions of years, the Gulf Coast shoreline has been moving farther south.

In Texas and Louisiana, petrified palmwood is most common in the Toledo Bend area, which is shared by both states. It was left by trees that grew when the Gulf of Mexico&#x27;s shoreline was much farther north from its present-day position. In Louisiana, petrified palmwood is found in the parishes of Rapides, Natchitoches, Grant, and Sabine.

== Description ==

Petrified palmwood includes a group of fossil woods that contain prominent rod-like structures within the regular grain of the silicified wood. Depending upon the angle at which they are cut by fracture, these rod-like structures show up as spots, tapering rods, or continuous lines. The rod-like structures are sclerenchyma bundles that comprise part of the woody tissues that gave the wood its vertical strength.

Petrified palmwood is a favorite of rock collectors because it is replaced by silica and exhibits well-defined rod-like structures and variety of colors. As a result, it exhibits a wide range of colors and designs when cut that can be incorporated into jewelry and other ornamental items. Because it is composed of silica, it is hard enough to polish and withstand the wear and tear of normal use.

== Archaeology ==
In Grant Parish, Louisiana (and probably in other areas also), Native Americans used petrified palmwood to make projectile points and other tools such as knives, awls, and scrapers. Projectile points and other tools crafted from petrified palmwood have been discovered in central Grant Parish by H.R. Hicks and other Native American artifact collectors. It is the state stone of Texas and the official state fossil of Louisiana.

== Species ==

There are more than 200 species assigned to the genus &quot;Palmoxylon&quot; at this time.
