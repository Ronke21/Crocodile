<text>The AMD K8 Hammer, also code-named SledgeHammer, is a computer processor microarchitecture designed by AMD as the successor to the AMD K7 Athlon microarchitecture. The K8 was the first implementation of the AMD64 64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set architecture.

== Features ==

== Processors ==
Processors based on the K8 core include:

* Athlon 64 - first 64-bit consumer desktop
* Athlon 64 X2 - first dual-core (&#x27;X2&#x27;) desktop
** Athlon X2 - later model dual-core desktop with &#x27;64&#x27; omitted
* Athlon 64 FX - enthusiast desktop (multipliers unlocked)
* Sempron - low-end, low-cost desktop
* Opteron - server market
* Turion 64 - mobile computing market
* Turion 64 X2 - dual-core mobile processor

The K8 core is very similar to the K7. The most radical change is the integration of the AMD64 instructions and an on-chip memory controller. The memory controller drastically reduces memory latency and is largely responsible for most of the performance gains from K7 to K8.

== Nomenclature ==

It is perceived by the PC community that after the use of the codename &quot;K8&quot; for the Athlon 64 processor family, AMD no longer uses K-nomenclatures (which originally stood for Kryptonite) since no K-nomenclature naming convention beyond &quot;K8&quot; has appeared in official AMD documents and press releases after the beginning of 2005. AMD now refers to the codename &quot;K8&quot; processors as the &quot;Family 0Fh&quot; processors. 10h and 0Fh refer to the main result of the CPUID x86 processor instruction. In hexadecimal numbering, 0F(h) (where the &quot;h&quot; represents hexadecimal numbering) equals the decimal number 15, and 10(h) equals the decimal number 16. (The &quot;K10h&quot; form that sometimes pops up is an improper hybrid of the &quot;K&quot; code and &quot;Family&quot; identifier number.)

<text>The McEwen ministry (Country–Liberal Coalition) was the 43rd ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 18th prime minister, John McEwen. The McEwen ministry succeeded the Second Holt ministry, which dissolved on 19 December 1967 following the disappearance of former prime minister Harold Holt – the third and most recent occasion where a sitting prime minister died in office. Since McEwen was the head of the Country Party, it was a caretaker ministry until the senior partner in the Coalition, the Liberal Party, could elect a new leader. John Gorton was ultimately elected on 9 January 1968, and he was sworn in as prime minister along with his ministry the following day.

As of 20 December 2020, Ian Sinclair and Peter Nixon are the last surviving members of the McEwen ministry. James Forbes, who died in 2019, was the last surviving Liberal minister, and Allen Fairhall, who died in 2006, was the last surviving Liberal Cabinet minister.

<doc id="1202830" wikidata="Q169841" url="?curid=1202830" title="Nazim al-Qudsi">
<text>Nazim al-Qudsi (; 14 February 1906 – 6 February 1998), was a Syrian politician who served as the 14th president of Syria from 14 December 1961 to 8 March 1963.

==Early life and education==
Al-Qudsi was born in Aleppo on 14 February 1906. After graduating from Aleppo College, he obtained his law degree from Damascus University. He later received a master&#x27;s degree from the American University of Beirut (AUB), and PhD from the University of Geneva-affiliated Graduate Institute of International Studies.

==Early career==
After his education, Qudsi returned to Syria in 1935 and joined the National Bloc, the leading anti-French independence movement, and became one of its prominent members in Aleppo. It was a political organization which sought to emancipate Syria from French control through diplomatic means rather than armed resistance. In 1936, he ran for parliament on a National Bloc ticket and won. He clashed with the Bloc leadership that failed to prevent the annexation of Alexandretta to Turkey in 1939. As a result, he resigned from the Bloc ranks. Qudsi created a coalition of Aleppine intellectuals around himself and Rushdi al-Kikhya, another lawyer who shared in his views, and the two men nominated themselves for Parliament in 1943, winning with ease. They lobbied against the election of Shukri al-Quwatli, a National Bloc leader, as president, but Quwatli was voted into office in August 1943. To appease the opposition, the new president appointed Qudsi as Syria&#x27;s first Ambassador to the United States. Qudsi founded the Syrian Embassy in Washington, D.C. from scratch, and on 19 March 1945 presented his credentials to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1947, he and Rushdi al-Kikhya founded the People&#x27;s Party in Aleppo. It was inaugurated as an opposition movement to the Quwatli regime and created to counterbalance the political weight of the National Party, the successor to the National Bloc, loyal to Quwatli. The People&#x27;s Party founders were mainly notables from Aleppo who aimed at creating union between Syria and Iraq, maintaining a democratic government, and advocating stronger ties with the West. The Hashemite royal family in Baghdad supported the party and funded many of its activities.

In 1947, Qudsi ran for Parliament on a party ticket and won. His election was repeated in 1949, 1954, and 1962. He voted against the re-election of Quwatli as president, but a parliamentary majority pushed through the election. On 29 March 1949, the Quwatli administration was toppled by a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, launched by Chief of Staff Husni al-Za&#x27;im. Syria&#x27;s new ruler asked Qudsi to form a government but he declined, claiming that the Za’im regime was unconstitutional and arguing that despite his faults, Quwatli was a constitutionally elected president while Za’im was an “illegal” one. As a result, Za’im had him arrested and the People&#x27;s Party was shut down. He was released shortly afterwards and placed under house arrest in Aleppo. He became highly critical of Za’im when the latter closed Syria&#x27;s border with Jordan and Iraq and threatened to go to war with both countries, accusing them of being agents of Great Britain in the Middle East. On 14 August 1949, he supported a coup that toppled and killed Za’im, launched by General Sami al-Hinnawi, an old friend of the People&#x27;s Party and an ally of the Hashemite royals in Baghdad. Hinnawi created a political committee to run political affairs in the absence of an official government and appointed Qudsi to its top leadership. Qudsi also served on the Constitutional Assembly that drafted a new constitution for Syria and became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first post-Za’im cabinet of Prime Minister Hashim al-Atassi (an ally of the People&#x27;s Party as well as a founding member and former president of the National Bloc). His ally Kikhiya became Minister of Interior while other posts were distributed accordingly to members of the People&#x27;s Party and independents who also opposed the old regime. Qudsi conducted talks with Crown Prince Abd al-Illah of Iraq for creating immediate union between Syria and Iraq and made numerous journeys to Baghdad for the purpose. He formulated an agreement that called for federal union, preserving independent governments in Damascus and Baghdad while coordinating military, economic, social, cultural, and political affairs between the two states. He then went to Cairo and proposed a similar program for all Arab states at the Arab League on 1 January 1951.

==Career before 1961 coup==

To advance union talks, al-Atassi, who had recently been elected president of the republic, called on Qudsi to form a government on 24 December 1949. The latter complied, but military officers vetoed his cabinet and he resigned from office five days after coming to power. The officers argued that his government did not include an officer among its midst and that many of its members were declared opponents of officer meddling in political affairs. On 4 June 1950, Qudsi created a new government, less extremist than the first, and was able to secure its approval by appointing General Fawzi Selu as Minister of Defense. Selu was the right-hand-man of General Adib al-Shishakli, the military strongman of Syria. The cabinet lived for ten months, but was unable to take the union issue any further. Qudsi resigned on 27 March 1951. On 1 October 1951, he was elected Speaker of Parliament. Shortly afterwards, on 28 November, Adib al-Shishakli seized power in Damascus and arrested the entire People&#x27;s Party leadership, accusing them of wanting to topple Syria&#x27;s republican regime and replace it with a monarchical one that was loyal to Britain and Iraq. He appointed Selu as provisional head of state and arrested Qudsi, sending him to Mezzeh prison. He was released in January 1952 but placed under house arrest. He joined the underground and worked in secret against Shishakli, supporting a coup d&#x27;état that brought him down in February 1954.

In October 1954, Nazim al-Qudsi became a deputy in the first post-Shishakli Parliament and was elected speaker on 14 October 1954. He tried to regain some of his influence in political circles, but by that time, the People&#x27;s Party had fallen from grace, and few Syrians advocated union with Iraq. Instead, they wanted union with Egypt, under the rising leadership of the young and charismatic President Gamal Abd al-Nasser. In vain, Qudsi tried challenging Nasser&#x27;s authority. He advocated pro-British and pro-American views at a time when the majority of Syrians had become pro-Soviet Union. He called on Syria to join the Baghdad Pact, an Anglo-American treaty to contain Communism, and pro-Nasser newspapers accused him of working as an agent for the Hashemites. On 12 October 1957, Qudsi resigned from office and was replaced by the pro-Nasser socialist leader, Akram al-Hawrani. He voted against the Syrian-Egyptian union and when the two countries merged to form the United Arab Republic (UAR) in 1958, he resigned from public life altogether and retired to Aleppo.

===International relations after the UAR===
On 28 September 1961, a new coup took place in Syria and toppled the UAR government. Qudsi rallied to its support and nominated himself for the first post-union Parliament, becoming a deputy for Aleppo in December 1961. He then ran for presidential office and won, becoming the first post-Nasser leader of Syria on 12 December 1961. As president, he worked to restore Syria&#x27;s friendship with the anti-Nasser regimes in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, and build bridges with the United States and Great Britain. The Hashemite family in Baghdad, which had supported his career for the past thirty years, had been toppled by a bloody military revolution in July 1958. He was never on good terms with the new leaders of Iraq, especially the revolt leader, General Abd al-Karim Qasim. The West, particularly President John F. Kennedy, welcomed Qudsi&#x27;s ascent and labeled him a &quot;friend&quot; of the United States. To promote Syria&#x27;s relations with Washington, Qudsi appointed Omar Abu-Riche, a renowned poet from Aleppo who like him, was an AUB graduate, as ambassador in the years 1961–1963. He began a massive economic reform program, restoring factories that had been nationalized by Nasser when he headed the UAR, and dismissing all pro-Nasser officials from office. All officers who were still loyal to the Egyptian President were discharged from the Syrian Army. Qudsi drafted a new constitution for Syria, restored the outlawed political parties, and received loans from the World Bank for rebuilding Syria&#x27;s dislocated economy.

==Presidential term==
President Qudsi clashed with the officers that had brought him to power and tried to marginalize their role in political affairs. He appointed Maarouf al-Dawalibi, a veteran of the People&#x27;s Party with declared anti-officer views, as Prime Minister and Rashad Barmada from the same party as Minister of Defense. Bitter from his experience with the officers since the Shishakli era, Dawalibi began curbing their influence in all state affairs and centralizing matters in the hands of Qudsi and the government. On 28 March 1962, a coup d&#x27;état took place in Syria, launched by Colonel Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi. He arrested Qudsi and Dawalibi, accusing them of misusing their powers and persecuting the officers of the Syrian Army. A counter coup broke out on 2 April, headed by Chief of Staff Abd al-Karim Zahr al-Din, who ordered all troops to stand by President Qudsi. The army complied, releasing Qudsi from prison and restoring the dissolved Parliament. Qudsi refused to arrest or kill Nehlawi, but rather, curbed his power by appointing him military attaché to Indonesia—a purely ceremonial post. He then tried to appease the officers and the socialists by calling on Bashir al-Azma, a doctor who had been close to Nasser and who held office as Minister of Health under the UAR, to become Prime Minister in April 1962 and Rashad Barmada (Qudsi&#x27;s long time friend) became the Deputy Prime minister. His cabinet included members of the socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party that was pro-Nasser. Qudsi and Azma dispatched Foreign Minister Adnan al-Azhari to Cairo to mend relations with the Egyptian President. When that failed, however, they filed a complaint to the Arab League, accusing him of wanting to destabilize Syria through interfering in its domestic affairs and calling on the army to rebel against the government. On 8 March 1963, however, another coup d&#x27;état took place in Syria, launched by the Military Committee of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. The officers who came to power pledged to restore the UAR and had Qudsi arrested. He was released after a while. He moved to Lebanon, Europe, and finally to Jordan where he lived in exile until his death on February 6, 1998, a week before his 92nd birthday.

<text>The first Whitlam Ministry (Labor) was the 47th ministry of the Government of Australia. Often known as the &quot;two-man Ministry&quot; or the &quot;Duumvirate&quot;, it was led by the country&#x27;s 21st Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. The first Whitlam ministry succeeded the McMahon Ministry, which dissolved on 5 December 1972 following the federal election that took place on 2 December which saw Labor defeat William McMahon&#x27;s Liberal–Country Coalition. The ministry was replaced by the second Whitlam ministry on 19 December 1972.

Whitlam had just led the Australian Labor Party to victory after 23 years of Coalition rule. Historically, when Labor won government, the caucus elected the members of the ministry, with Labor Prime Ministers only having the right to allocate portfolios. Although Labor&#x27;s victory was beyond doubt, counting was scheduled to continue until 15 December, two weeks after the 2 December election.

In accordance with longstanding Australian constitutional practice, the outgoing Prime Minister, William McMahon, advised the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, that he was no longer in a position to govern. Whitlam then advised Hasluck that he could form a government with his new majority. Normally, McMahon would have stayed on as a caretaker until the final results were known. However, Whitlam was unwilling to wait that long. Accordingly, soon after advising Hasluck that he could form a government, Whitlam had himself and his deputy leader, Lance Barnard, sworn in as an interim two-man government until the full ministry could be chosen. For the next two weeks, Whitlam and Barnard held 27 portfolios between them. It is the smallest ministry in Australian history.

Whitlam, who died in 2014, was the last surviving member of the first Whitlam ministry, having outlived Barnard by 17 years.

==Achievements==
The duumvirate made 40 significant decisions in its brief tenure, including the immediate release of all draft resisters, the removal of troops from Vietnam and the recognition of Communist China.

As of 21 October 2023, Doug McClelland is the last surviving member of the second Whitlam ministry.

<text>The M118 is an air-dropped general-purpose or demolition bomb used by United States military forces. It dates back to the time of the Korean War of the early 1950s. Although it has a nominal weight of , its actual weight, depending on fuse and retardation options, is somewhat higher. A typical non-retarded configuration has a total weight of with an explosive content of of tritonal. This is a much higher percentage than in the more recent American Mark 80 series bombs thus the designation as a demolition bomb.

In the late 1950s through the early 1970s it was a standard aircraft weapon, carried by the F-100 Super Sabre, F-111 Ardvark, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, and F-4 Phantom. Some apparently remain in the USAF inventory, although they are rarely used today.

It was a component of the GBU-9/B version of the Rockwell electro-optically guided Homing Bomb System (HOBOS). This weapon consisted of an M118 fitted with a KMU-390/B guidance kit with an image contrast seeker, strakes and cruciform tail fins to guide the bomb to its target. It was also used in the Texas Instruments Paveway series of laser-guided bombs as the GBU-11 when it was fitted with the KMU-388 seeker head, MAU-157 Computer Control Group and the MXU-602 Airfoil Group. This latter consisted of four fixed cruciform fins and four moveable canards to control the bomb&#x27;s trajectory. It was also fitted with an AIM-9B Sidewinder infra-red seeker and an AGM-45 Shrike nose cone during 1967 tests at the Naval Ordnance Test Station China Lake, possibly in an attempt to create an infra-red guided bomb. This was called the &quot;Bombwinder&quot;.

15 of these M118 Paveway Is were evaluated between 15 October to 9 November 1969.

<text>The third Whitlam ministry (Labor) was the 49th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 21st Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. The third Whitlam ministry succeeded the Second Whitlam ministry, which dissolved on 12 June 1974 following the federal election that took place in May. The ministry was replaced by the First Fraser Ministry on 11 November following the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr.
The order of seniority in the third Whitlam ministry was determined by the order in which members were elected to the Ministry by the Caucus on 10 June 1974, except for the four parliamentary leaders.

As of 21 October 2023, Doug McClelland and Paul Keating are the last surviving members of the third Whitlam ministry.

<text>The first Fraser ministry (Liberal–National Country coalition) was the 50th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. The first Fraser ministry succeeded the Third Whitlam ministry, which dissolved on 11 November following the dismissal of the Whitlam government by Governor-General Sir John Kerr. As such, it was a caretaker ministry until a federal election could take place. To date, it is the last ministry not to be split between a Cabinet and outer ministry. In the event, the Coalition was ultimately elected on 13 December 1975, and this ministry was replaced by the second Fraser ministry on 22 December 1975.

As of 25 October 2022, Ian Sinclair and Peter Nixon are the last surviving members of the first Fraser ministry. Tony Street was the last surviving Liberal member.

<doc id="1202841" wikidata="Q1824024" url="?curid=1202841" title="Haselbech">
<text>Haselbech (Pronounced Hazel-beech) is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 87 people. The population remained less than 100 at the 2011 Census and was included in the civil parish of Kelmarsh.

The villages name origin is uncertain. &#x27;Hazel-tree river valley&#x27; or &#x27;hazel-tree ridge&#x27;.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of eight listed buildings in the parish of Haselbech, all of which are Grade II apart from St Michael&#x27;s Church, which is Grade II*. They are:
*St Michael&#x27;s Church, Cottesbrooke Road
*Orton Holding, Cottesbrooke Road
*The Old Rectory, Cottesbrooke Road
*Wall attached to north west of the Old Rectory, Cottesbrooke Road
*Haselbech Hall, Kelmarsh Road
*Manor Farm, Naseby Road
*Railings south east of Manor Farmhouse, Naseby Road
*Railings south west of Manor Farmhouse, Naseby Road
In addition, an area of undeveloped land south of Naseby Road and west of Cottesbrooke Road which is the site of a medieval settlement is a scheduled monument.

===St Michael&#x27;s Church===

This was built in the 13th and 14th centuries with coursed lias, limestone and ashlar walls and slate. The roofs are now of slate, lead and aluminium. The building includes a nave, aisles, a chancel and west tower.

The three bays of pews at the east of the nave are probably 15th century and the font probably 13th century but with a later base. There is a chancel screen and a tower screen. The pulpit is Jacobean with decorated panels and a tester.

Haselbech is part of a united Benefice along with Clipston, Kelmarsh and Naseby.

===Haselbech Hall===
This existing building was probably constructed by Henry Jones for Randolph Wykes and is built of limestone ashlar with stone mullioned windows and a slate roof. It is of two storeys with attic and cellar, laid out to a double depth plan. The house was gutted by fire in 1917 and remodelled after that date. The description on the Historic England website was issued in 1985 and is based on external inspection only. Historic England&#x27;s description states that the building is 18th century. However, this is not consistent with the statement in &quot;An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in the County of Northamptonshire&quot; that &quot;Haselbech Hall was built just before 1678 for the Wyke [sic] family&quot;. Particulars prepared for the marketing of Haselbech Hall contain detailed descriptions and illustrations of the property in 2015.

<text>Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU) is a public university in University Center, Michigan, United States, in Saginaw County. It was founded in 1963 as Saginaw Valley College. It is located on in Saginaw County&#x27;s Kochville Township, approximately north of downtown Saginaw. Saginaw Valley State is the newest of Michigan&#x27;s 15 public colleges and universities. SVSU offers over 100 academic programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels with approximately 8,500 students at its main campus in University Center. SVSU offers programs of study in its five colleges.

==History==
Higher education in the Saginaw Valley region dates back to the founding of Bay City Junior College in 1922. Though the junior college was replaced by Delta College in 1961, the area still lacked a four-year baccalaureate institution. Saginaw Valley College was founded as a private institution in November 1963, and became a state-supported institution in 1965. The name changed to Saginaw Valley State College in 1974 and again to Saginaw Valley State University in 1987.

In 1955, civic leaders in the Saginaw Valley region met to discuss prospects for a local institution of higher education. The next year, a committee of 300 recommended a two-year community college which would expand to a four-year college. The two-year college, Delta, was approved by voters in 1958 and opened in 1961.

===Saginaw Valley College===
Articles of incorporation for what would become Saginaw Valley College (originally called Delta Senior University) were drawn up in 1963, and the state granted a charter to SVC as a private, four-year liberal arts institution. Dr. Samuel D. Marble, the president of Delta College, was appointed president of SVC in 1964. After holding both presidencies for four months, he resigned from Delta. The first class of 119 students completed two years at Delta and transferred to SVC. The first commencement ceremony was held in 1966 at a Midland church for a graduating class of ten. A site for a permanent SVC campus (the college was operating out of Delta&#x27;s basement) was chosen in Kochville Township in 1966 and classes were moved to a building on that site the next year. Ground was broken for what would become Wickes Hall in the late summer. Saginaw Valley College received full accreditation by the North Central Association in April 1970. The college&#x27;s athletic teams were named the Redbirds, shortly thereafter changed to Cardinals after two coaches spotted a kitchen decoration with a cardinal on it at a golf tournament in Kentucky. In 1972, the Cardinals became a charter member of the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and in 1974 Frank &quot;Muddy&quot; Waters was hired as the college&#x27;s first football coach.

===Saginaw Valley State College===
The name changed to Saginaw Valley State College in 1974. That same year, Samuel D. Marble, the college&#x27;s president who had also served in that role at Delta College, submitted his resignation. Marble had also served as president of Wilmington College (Ohio) in Ohio. He would be named president emeritus and is honored with a lecture hall named in his honor in Wickes Hall. In November 1974, Jack M. Ryder became president of the college. A report by the Michigan Efficiency Task Force in 1977 recommended to then-Governor William G. Milliken that SVSC and Delta could be run more efficiently if they were combined, an idea which gained no traction. In 1980 the Higher Learning Commission/North Central Association continued this accreditation and granted accreditation at the master&#x27;s degree level. Both accreditations have been retained continuously since the original accreditation. Also in 1980, two Japanese students attended SVSC for two weeks, beginning what is now a flourishing international student enrollment. A fire in 1985 destroyed financial records, registration files, and other important records. The college became home to the works of the noted sculptor Marshall M. Fredericks in June 1987.

===Saginaw Valley State University===
On November 5, 1987, SVSC became Saginaw Valley State University. Dr. Jack Ryder resigned as president in 1989 and Eric R. Gilbertson succeeded him. An off-campus location was opened in Cass City in 1991. In 2000, George W. Bush visited the Ryder Center days before the election where he would be elected President of the United States. The annual Battle of the Valleys, a fundraising competition against rival Grand Valley State University, was established in 2003. In 2009, SVSU alumnus Tony Ceccacci was the lead flight director for STS-125, a mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, and an SVSU pennant was sent to space on board the Space Shuttle Atlantis. The pennant is currently on display in Pioneer Hall. On June 18, 2013, President Gilbertson announced his intention to retire when the university&#x27;s board of control finds his replacement.

Ming Chuan University, the first Asian university to be accredited in the United States, opened their Michigan Campus in Gilbertson Hall in 2014.

In 2015, SVSU applied to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to receive a Community Engagement Classification. To be selected, institutions provide descriptions and examples of institutionalized practices of community engagement that showed alignment among mission, culture, leadership, resources and practices. The designation is in effect for 10 years.

===Presidents===
Samuel Davey Marble served as president of SVC from March 23, 1964, to January 14, 1974. He had been the first president of Delta College, from 1958 to 1964. The lecture hall in Wickes Hall was named in his honor, the Gladys and Samuel Marble Graduate Business Scholarship Fund was established in 1997, and the Samuel Marble Memorial Scholarship was established in 1990 to be awarded to a transfer student from Delta.

Jack McBride Ryder served as president of SVSC/SVSU from November 1, 1974, to June 30, 1989. He initiated the successful construction of Brown Hall, the Zahnow Library, the science building, and the Ryder Center. He was also instrumental in raising private gifts for the construction of Pioneer Hall, the Arbury Fine Arts Center, the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum, and Wickes Stadium. Due to his leadership, SVSC, Grand Valley State College, Ferris State College, and Lake Superior State College were all elevated to universities by legislation signed on November 4, 1987. Dr. Ryder was named a president emeritus of the University on December 13, 1991.

Eric R. Gilbertson was inaugurated as president of SVSU on August 29, 1989, and served as the longest-tenured in SVSU&#x27;s history. During his tenure, the university&#x27;s endowment has increased twenty-fold and the campus physical plant has tripled in size. Enrollment nearly doubled during his tenure. Gilbertson is a former president of Johnson State College in Vermont and was the executive assistant to the president of Ohio State University as well as legal counsel to the Ohio Board of Regents. Dr. Gilbertson announced his intention to retire in 2013 upon the appointment of his successor.

On February 10, 2014, Donald Bachand, the university&#x27;s provost and academic vice president, was named SVSU&#x27;s fourth president. He officially took office February 17 and was formally installed June 22.

Dr. George Grant Jr. began serving as the fifth president of Saginaw Valley State University on January 1, 2023. He joined SVSU after previously serving as chancellor of Penn State Berks. Prior to that, Grant spent 24 years at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, including 12 years as dean of the College of Community and Public Service.

<doc id="1202847" wikidata="Q2647171" url="?curid=1202847" title="Harlestone">
<text>Harlestone is a village and civil parish in the West Northamptonshire district, in the ceremonial county of Northamptonshire, England. The parish had a recorded population of 445 in the 2011 census. From 1974 to 2021 it was in Daventry district.

The village is divided into two smaller settlements: Upper Harlestone and Lower Harlestone, which are linked by road, footpaths and bridleways. Lower Harlestone lies along the A428, and Upper Harlestone is directly to the south-west. Both settlements are approximately five miles north-west of the town of Northampton and south-east of the neighbouring country estate of Althorp.

==History==
Evidence of prehistoric settlement can be found in the area of Harlestone, including a Scheduled Ancient Monument to the east of the village, where the remains of prehistoric settlement can be seen from aerial photography.
An Iron Age site has been identified at the quarry site on the southern edge of Lower Harlestone, with possible evidence of landscape features dating from the late Bronze Age. 

Evidence of Roman occupation is also prevalent, particularly to the west, where the remains of a Roman dwelling were excavated in a field named Sharoah in 1927, and a hoard of over 800 coins found. Further evidence of Romano-British ironworking has been located near to Upper Harlestone in the west. 

It is highly likely that the name Harlestone stems from Anglo-Saxon or Danish origin. It is variously spelt Erlestone, Herolvestone and Herolvestune in early records, possibly from the name of a local land owner.
St Andrew&#x27;s Churchyard is a possible Saxon site, due to its rounded shape and the presence of a spring beneath its nave. 

A middle-eastern gold coin was unearthed during cleaning work on the nearby stables, which implies that an individual from Harlestone took part in the Crusades in the 11th century and was buried with spoils. 

Harlestone may have been the subject of Viking raids in the early 11th century, and many plots are noted in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being of a &quot;waste&quot; nature. Harlestone was partly granted to the Count of Mortain by his half-brother William the Conqueror and partly to William Peverel, including three manors. Domesday Book also notes 15 freedmen in the village, a mill and a priest. 

Henry de Bray held one of the manors of Harlestone in the late 13th century and left extensive records of his works and life in estate books, which are now held in the British Museum. 

He completed the construction of his manor, on the site of the current Manor Farm, including various gardens and a mill, which is quite possibly the mill whose ruins stand in Lower Harlestone. 

Quarry scars in Lower Harlestone are tentatively dated to the post-medieval period, but are described by Morton in 1712 as &quot;very ancient&quot;. It is possible that these earthworks were produced in the construction of de Bray&#x27;s manor complex. 
The second manor of Harlestone was owned by the Lumley family from the 13th century, presumably that previously belonging to the Count of Mortain, and situated in Upper Harlestone on the site of Dovecote House. It comprised a hall, stables, outbuildings and a dovecote. This structure still survives as part of the 15th-century dovecote on the site, and is the only building left from the manorial complex. Roger Lumley is named &quot;Lord of Harlestone&quot; in 1316 and his descendant Robert Lumley purchased Althorp in 1364, but it was re-sold in 1414 by his son. They continued to hold the manor in Harlestone until 1500 when Thomas Andrew of Charwelton bought the land, also permitting them to stay in their accommodation. 

Under Henry de Bray there was also a remodelling of St Andrew’s Church, creating much of the building we see today. It was mostly built between 1320 and 1325, although the tower dates back to the 12th century, with de Bray providing the stone and timber.

The third and final estate at this time was owned by the Bulmer family, whose lands were placed into the hands of trustees in 1441 by Sir Ralph de Bulmer, and not mentioned again in literature until the 18th century. 

The three earliest surviving dwellings within the village are from the late 17th century, all located in Upper Harlestone. Hearth Tax Returns of the late 17th century show that the village had 115 houses, of which 95 had one hearth. Larger properties are indicated by these records, including a property owned by Thomas Andrew which had twelve hearths. Several farms are noted as having two or three hearths.

During the English Civil War, the evidence points towards the majority of Harlestone supporting the Parliamentarian cause, particularly because of its proximity to the staunchly anti-royalist Northampton. The exception is the royalist Sir Lewis Dyve, then owner of Henry de Bray&#x27;s Manor Farm, whose lands were confiscated and handed to the Andrew family.

Harlestone was a well-connected village. Alongside many enduring internal pathways, road maps of John Ogilvy of 1675 indicate that the current A428 to Dunchurch initially fell to the west of Upper Harlestone, skirting down past Althorp, leading to Kingsthorpe in Northampton. By 1738, the Northampton to Dunchurch turnpike had been established on the eastern side where the A428 now travels. 

In 1715, Thomas Andrew built Harlestone House, a grand neo-classical mansion on the edge of a lake, surrounded by heath parkland. In 1753, they also acquired the Bulmer Estate, which, when added to the sequestered lands of Sir Lewis Dyve, brought the majority of Harlestone under Andrew&#x27;s control.

The enclosure of Harlestone occurred in 1766, with the main gainer being Robert Andrew. Many of the large farms in the area are enclosure farms, including Mill Farm, Glebe Farm and Fleetland Farm. Many of the other farms in the village remain from earlier strip farming, such as Rock Farm.

Between 1809 and 1811, Robert Andrew employed the noted architects and landscape designers, Humphrey and John Adey Repton, to make alterations to Harlestone House. The house was demolished in 1940, but the Grade II* listed stables, the classically designed dam bridge and boathouse, and the paddocks still exist. 
In 1829, Robert Andrew sold the Harlestone Estate to Earl Spencer of Althorp. Many properties were built in the 19th century under the Althorp Estate, particularly worker&#x27;s cottages, like the sets of Ten Cottages in Upper and Lower Harlestone. A quarry face, possibly from this time, is still visible along Port Road, near to Park Farmhouse. The consistent architectural style pervades building of this time in Harlestone and the neighbouring villages. The Althorp Estate is still the major land owner in the village, and some properties may have possible applicable covenants.

The 1834 foundation of the Union for Poor Law Administration saw Harlestone in the Brixworth Union, and the village workhouse was built, now forming several houses on Port Road, Upper Harlestone. 

Non-conformist religion was very popular in Northamptonshire, and land for the former Baptist Chapel in Upper Harlestone, now a dwelling, was granted by the Fifth Earl Spencer in 1873. 

In the 1870s, the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described the parish as follows:

&quot;a parish in Brixworth district, Northamptonshire; 2½ miles WSW of Brampton railway station, and 4 NW of Northampton. It has a post-office under Northampton. Acres, 2,530. Real property, £4,314. Pop., 615. Houses, 138. The property is divided among a few. The manor belongs to Earl Spencer. Harlestone Hall is a chief residence. Traces of an old fort are on Dylve&#x27;s Heath. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Peterborough. Value, £577. Patron, Earl Spencer. The church is of the 14th century, very good, and has an old font. There are a national school, and charities upwards of £100.&quot;

The remains of brickworks from the 19th century can be found in Upper Harlestone in the form of a large kiln, which provided local people with brick for building. 

In 1924, the Duchess of Grafton started a fund to build the Village Institute in Upper Harlestone. 

The Althorp Estate sold the land of the former Harlestone House to the Northampton Golf Club in 1990, and their clubhouse now occupies the former site of the house. 

Many properties within the village were also sold at this time by Althorp to private owners. Owing to the provision of back land areas, areas for pigsties and garden plots, some infill development to the rear of historic properties has occurred, as well as between dwellings.

== Harlestone Firs ==
Also recorded as Harlestone Furze in the records of the Northamptonshire Natural History Society.
Harlestone Firs, a large wood and country park, lies just outside the village with a garden centre on the other side of the A428.

==Population ==
The population as recorded in the decannual censuses peaked in the 1830s at just under 650 people, falling to 420 in 2001:

<doc id="1202852" wikidata="Q1376406" url="?curid=1202852" title="Constructed wetland">
<text>A constructed wetland is an artificial wetland to treat sewage, greywater, stormwater runoff or industrial wastewater. It may also be designed for land reclamation after mining, or as a mitigation step for natural areas lost to land development. Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that use the natural functions of vegetation, soil, and organisms to provide secondary treatment to wastewater. The design of the constructed wetland has to be adjusted according to the type of wastewater to be treated. Constructed wetlands have been used in both centralized and decentralized wastewater systems. Primary treatment is recommended when there is a large amount of suspended solids or soluble organic matter (measured as biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand).

Similar to natural wetlands, constructed wetlands also act as a biofilter and/or can remove a range of pollutants (such as organic matter, nutrients, pathogens, heavy metals) from the water. Constructed wetlands are designed to remove water pollutants such as suspended solids, organic matter and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). All types of pathogens (i.e., bacteria, viruses, protozoans and helminths) are expected to be removed to some extent in a constructed wetland. Subsurface wetlands provide greater pathogen removal than surface wetlands.

There are two main types of constructed wetlands: subsurface flow and surface flow. The planted vegetation plays an important role in contaminant removal. The filter bed, consisting usually of sand and gravel, has an equally important role to play. Some constructed wetlands may also serve as a habitat for native and migratory wildlife, although that is not their main purpose. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands are designed to have either horizontal flow or vertical flow of water through the gravel and sand bed. Vertical flow systems have a smaller space requirement than horizontal flow systems.

== Terminology ==

Many terms are used to denote constructed wetlands, such as reed beds, soil infiltration beds, treatment wetlands, engineered wetlands, man-made or artificial wetlands. A biofilter has some similarities with a constructed wetland, but is usually without plants.

The term of constructed wetlands can also be used to describe restored and recultivated land that was destroyed in the past through draining and converting into farmland, or mining.

== Overview ==
A constructed wetland is an engineered sequence of water bodies designed to treat wastewater or storm water runoff.

Vegetation in a wetland provides a substrate (roots, stems, and leaves) upon which microorganisms can grow as they break down organic materials. This community of microorganisms is known as the periphyton. The periphyton and natural chemical processes are responsible for approximately 90 percent of pollutant removal and waste breakdown. The plants remove about seven to ten percent of pollutants, and act as a carbon source for the microbes when they decay. Different species of aquatic plants have different rates of heavy metal uptake, a consideration for plant selection in a constructed wetland used for water treatment. Constructed wetlands are of two basic types: subsurface flow and surface flow wetlands.

Constructed wetlands are one example of nature-based solutions and of phytoremediation.

Constructed wetland systems are highly controlled environments that intend to mimic the occurrences of soil, flora, and microorganisms in natural wetlands to aid in treating wastewater. They are constructed with flow regimes, micro-biotic composition, and suitable plants in order to produce the most efficient treatment process.

=== Uses ===
Constructed wetlands can be used to treat raw sewage, storm water, agricultural and industrial effluent. Constructed wetlands mimic the functions of natural wetlands to capture stormwater, reduce nutrient loads, and create diverse wildlife habitat. Constructed wetlands are used for wastewater treatment or for greywater treatment.

Many regulatory agencies list treatment wetlands as one of their recommended &quot;best management practices&quot; for controlling urban runoff.

==Removal of contaminants==

Physical, chemical, and biological processes combine in wetlands to remove contaminants from wastewater. An understanding of these processes is fundamental not only to designing wetland systems but to understanding the fate of chemicals once they enter the wetland. Theoretically, wastewater treatment within a constructed wetland occurs as it passes through the wetland medium and the plant rhizosphere. A thin film around each root hair is aerobic due to the leakage of oxygen from the rhizomes, roots, and rootlets. Aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms facilitate decomposition of organic matter. Microbial nitrification and subsequent denitrification releases nitrogen as gas to the atmosphere. Phosphorus is coprecipitated with iron, aluminium, and calcium compounds located in the root-bed medium. Suspended solids filter out as they settle in the water column in surface flow wetlands or are physically filtered out by the medium within subsurface flow wetlands. Harmful bacteria, fungi, and viruses are reduced by filtration and adsorption by biofilms on the gravel or sand media in subsurface flow and vertical flow systems.

===Nitrogen removal===
The dominant forms of nitrogen in wetlands that are of importance to wastewater treatment include organic nitrogen, ammonia, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite. Total nitrogen refers to all nitrogen species. Wastewater nitrogen removal is important because of ammonia&#x27;s toxicity to fish if discharged into watercourses. Excessive nitrates in drinking water is thought to cause methemoglobinemia in infants, which decreases the blood&#x27;s oxygen transport ability. Moreover, excess input of N from point and non-point sources to surface water promotes eutrophication in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans which causes several problems in aquatic ecosystems e.g. toxic algal blooms, oxygen depletion in water, fish mortality, loss of aquatic biodiversity.

Ammonia removal occurs in constructed wetlands – if they are designed to achieve biological nutrient removal – in a similar ways as in sewage treatment plants, except that no external, energy-intensive addition of air (oxygen) is needed. It is a two-step process, consisting of nitrification followed by denitrification. The nitrogen cycle is completed as follows: ammonia in the wastewater is converted to ammonium ions; the aerobic bacterium &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; sp. oxidizes ammonium to nitrite; the bacterium &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; sp. then converts nitrite to nitrate. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is reduced to relatively harmless nitrogen gas that enters the atmosphere.

==== Nitrification ====

Nitrification is the biological conversion of organic and inorganic nitrogenous compounds from a reduced state to a more oxidized state, based on the action of two different bacteria types. Nitrification is strictly an aerobic process in which the end product is nitrate (). The process of nitrification oxidizes ammonium (from the wastewater) to nitrite (), and then nitrite is oxidized to nitrate ().

==== Denitrification ====

Denitrification is the biochemical reduction of oxidized nitrogen anions, nitrate and nitrite to produce the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide () and nitrogen gas (), with concomitant oxidation of organic matter. The end product, , and to a lesser extent the intermediary by product, , are gases that re-enter the atmosphere.

====Ammonia removal from mine water====
Constructed wetlands have been used to remove ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from contaminated mine water, including cyanide and nitrate.

===Phosphorus removal===
Phosphorus occurs naturally in both organic and inorganic forms. The analytical measure of biologically available orthophosphates is referred to as soluble reactive phosphorus (SR-P). Dissolved organic phosphorus and insoluble forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus are generally not biologically available until transformed into soluble inorganic forms.

In freshwater aquatic ecosystems phosphorus is typically the major limiting nutrient. Under undisturbed natural conditions, phosphorus is in short supply. The natural scarcity of phosphorus is demonstrated by the explosive growth of algae in water receiving heavy discharges of phosphorus-rich wastes. Because phosphorus does not have an atmospheric component, unlike nitrogen, the phosphorus cycle can be characterized as closed. The removal and storage of phosphorus from wastewater can only occur within the constructed wetland itself. Phosphorus may be sequestered within a wetland system by:
# The binding of phosphorus in organic matter as a result of incorporation into living biomass,
# Precipitation of insoluble phosphates with ferric iron, calcium, and aluminium found in wetland soils.

====Biomass plants incorporation====
Aquatic vegetation may play an important role in phosphorus removal and, if harvested, extend the life of a system by postponing phosphorus saturation of the sediments. Plants create a unique environment at the biofilm&#x27;s attachment surface. Certain plants transport oxygen which is released at the biofilm/root interface, adding oxygen to the wetland system. Plants also increase soil or other root-bed medium hydraulic conductivity. As roots and rhizomes grow they are thought to disturb and loosen the medium, increasing its porosity, which may allow more effective fluid movement in the rhizosphere. When roots decay they leave behind ports and channels known as macropores which are effective in channeling water through the soil.

===Metals removal===
Constructed wetlands have been used extensively for the removal of dissolved metals and metalloids. Although these contaminants are prevalent in mine drainage, they are also found in stormwater, landfill leachate and other sources (e.g., leachate or FDG washwater at coal-fired power plants), for which treatment wetlands have been constructed for mines.

====Mine water—Acid drainage removal====
Constructed wetlands can also be used for treatment of acid mine drainage from coal mines.

=== Pathogen removal ===
Constructed wetlands are not designed for pathogen removal, but have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter (biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).

All types of pathogens are expected to be removed in a constructed wetland; however, greater pathogen removal is expected to occur in a subsurface wetland. In a free water surface flow wetland one can expect 1 to 2 log10 reduction of pathogens; however, bacteria and virus removal may be less than 1 log10 reduction in systems that are heavily planted with vegetation. This is because constructed wetlands typically include vegetation which assists in removing other pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, the importance of sunlight exposure in removing viruses and bacteria is minimized in these systems.

Removal in a properly designed and operated free water surface flow wetland is reported to be less than 1 to 2 log10 for bacteria, less than 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 1 to 2 log10 for protozoa, and 1 to 2 log10 for helminths. In subsurface flow wetlands, the expected removal of pathogens is reported to be 1 to 3 log10 for bacteria, 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 2 log10 for protozoa, and 2 log10 for helminths.

The log10 removal efficiencies reported here can also be understood in terms of the common way of reporting removal efficiencies as percentages: 1 log10 removal is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 90%; 2 log10 = 99%; 3 log10 = 99.9%; 4 log10 = 99.99% and so on.

==Types and design considerations==

Constructed wetland systems can be surface flow systems with only free-floating macrophytes, floating-leaved macrophytes, or submerged macrophytes; however, typical free water surface systems are usually constructed with emergent macrophytes. Subsurface flow-constructed wetlands with a vertical or a horizontal flow regime are also common and can be integrated into urban areas as they require relatively little space.

The main three broad types of constructed wetlands include:
* Subsurface flow constructed wetland – this wetland can be either with vertical flow (the effluent moves vertically, from the planted layer down through the substrate and out) or with horizontal flow (the effluent moves horizontally, parallel to the surface)
* Surface flow constructed wetland (this wetland has horizontal flow)
* Floating treatment wetland

The former types are placed in a basin with a substrate to provide a surface area upon which large amounts of waste degrading biofilms form, while the latter relies on a flooded treatment basin upon which aquatic plants are held in flotation till they develop a thick mat of roots and rhizomes upon which biofilms form. In most cases, the bottom is lined with either a polymer geomembrane, concrete or clay (when there is appropriate clay type) in order to protect the water table and surrounding grounds. The substrate can be either gravel—generally limestone or pumice/volcanic rock, depending on local availability, sand or a mixture of various sizes of media (for vertical flow constructed wetlands).

Constructed wetlands can be used after a septic tank for primary treatment (or other types of systems) in order to separate the solids from the liquid effluent. Some constructed wetland designs however do not use upfront primary treatment.

===Subsurface flow ===


In subsurface flow constructed wetlands the flow of wastewater occurs between the roots of the plants and there is no water surfacing (it is kept below gravel). As a result, the system is more efficient, does not attract mosquitoes, is less odorous and less sensitive to winter conditions. Also, less area is needed to purify water. A downside to the system are the intakes, which can clog or bioclog easily, although some larger sized gravel will often solve this problem.

Subsurface flow wetlands can be further classified as horizontal flow or vertical flow constructed wetlands. In the vertical flow constructed wetland, the effluent moves vertically from the planted layer down through the substrate and out (requiring air pumps to aerate the bed). In the horizontal flow constructed wetland the effluent moves horizontally via gravity, parallel to the surface, with no surface water thus avoiding mosquito breeding. Vertical flow constructed wetlands are considered to be more efficient with less area required compared to horizontal flow constructed wetlands. However, they need to be interval-loaded and their design requires more know-how while horizontal flow constructed wetlands can receive wastewater continuously and are easier to build.

Due to the increased efficiency a vertical flow subsurface constructed wetland requires only about of space per person equivalent, down to 1.5 square metres in hot climates.

The &quot;French System&quot; combines primary and secondary treatment of raw wastewater. The effluent passes various filter beds whose grain size is getting progressively smaller (from gravel to sand).

==== Applications ====
Subsurface flow wetlands can treat a variety of different wastewaters, such as household wastewater, agricultural, paper mill wastewater, mining runoff, tannery or meat processing wastes, storm water.

The quality of the effluent is determined by the design and should be customized for the intended reuse application (like irrigation or toilet flushing) or the disposal method.

==== Design considerations ====
Depending on the type of constructed wetlands, the wastewater passes through a gravel and more rarely sand medium on which plants are rooted. A gravel medium (generally limestone or volcanic rock lavastone) can be used as well (the use of lavastone will allow for a surface reduction of about 20% over limestone) is mainly deployed in horizontal flow systems though it does not work as efficiently as sand (but sand will clog more readily).

Constructed subsurface flow wetlands are meant as secondary treatment systems which means that the effluent needs to first pass a primary treatment which effectively removes solids. Such a primary treatment can consist of sand and grit removal, grease trap, compost filter, septic tank, Imhoff tank, anaerobic baffled reactor or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification. Most important is the biological filtration through a biofilm of aerobic or facultative bacteria. Coarse sand in the filter bed provides a surfaces for microbial growth and supports the adsorption and filtration processes. For those microorganisms the oxygen supply needs to be sufficient.

Especially in warm and dry climates the effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation are significant. In cases of water loss, a vertical flow constructed wetland is preferable to a horizontal because of an unsaturated upper layer and a shorter retention time, although vertical flow systems are more dependent on an external energy source. Evapotranspiration (as is rainfall) is taken into account in designing a horizontal flow system.

The effluent can have a yellowish or brownish colour if domestic wastewater or blackwater is treated. Treated greywater usually does not tend to have a colour. Concerning pathogen levels, treated greywater meets the standards of pathogen levels for safe discharge to surface water. Treated domestic wastewater might need a tertiary treatment, depending on the intended reuse application.

Plantings of reedbeds are popular in European constructed subsurface flow wetlands, although at least twenty other plant species are usable. Many fast growing timer plants can be used, as well for example as &quot;Musa&quot; spp., &quot;Juncus&quot; spp., cattails (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.) and sedges.

==== Operation and maintenance ====
Overloading peaks should not cause performance problems while continuous overloading lead to a loss of treatment capacity through too much suspended solids, sludge or fats.

Subsurface flow wetlands require the following maintenance tasks: regular checking of the pretreatment process, of pumps when they are used, of influent loads and distribution on the filter bed.

==== Comparisons with other types ====
Subsurface wetlands are less hospitable to mosquitoes compared to surface flow wetlands, as there is no water exposed to the surface. Mosquitos can be a problem in surface flow constructed wetlands. Subsurface flow systems have the advantage of requiring less land area for water treatment than surface flow. However, surface flow wetlands can be more suitable for wildlife habitat.

For urban applications the area requirement of a subsurface flow constructed wetland might be a limiting factor compared to conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants. High rate aerobic treatment processes like activated sludge plants, trickling filters, rotating discs, submerged aerated filters or membrane bioreactor plants require less space. The advantage of subsurface flow constructed wetlands compared to those technologies is their operational robustness which is particularly important in developing countries. The fact that constructed wetlands do not produce secondary sludge (sewage sludge) is another advantage as there is no need for sewage sludge treatment. However, primary sludge from primary settling tanks does get produced and needs to be removed and treated.

==== Costs ====
The costs of subsurface flow constructed wetlands mainly depend on the costs of sand with which the bed has to be filled. Another factor is the cost of land.

===Surface flow ===

Surface flow wetlands, also known as free water surface constructed wetlands, can be used for tertiary treatment or polishing of effluent from wastewater treatment plants. They are also suitable to treat stormwater drainage.

Surface flow constructed wetlands always have horizontal flow of wastewater across the roots of the plants, rather than vertical flow. They require a relatively large area to purify water compared to subsurface flow constructed wetlands and may have increased smell and lower performance in winter.

Surface flow wetlands have a similar appearance to ponds for wastewater treatment (such as &quot;waste stabilization ponds&quot;) but are in the technical literature not classified as ponds.

Pathogens are destroyed by natural decay, predation from higher organisms, sedimentation and UV irradiation since the water is exposed to direct sunlight. The soil layer below the water is anaerobic but the roots of the plants release oxygen around them, this allows complex biological and chemical reactions.

Surface flow wetlands can be supported by a wide variety of soil types including bay mud and other silty clays.

Plants such as water hyacinth (&quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot;) and &quot;Pontederia&quot; spp. are used worldwide (although &quot;Typha&quot; and &quot;Phragmites&quot; are highly invasive).

However, surface flow constructed wetlands may encourage mosquito breeding. They may also have high algae production that lowers the effluent quality and due to open water surface mosquitos and odours, it is more difficult to integrate them in an urban neighbourhood.

===Hybrid systems===
A combination of different types of constructed wetlands is possible to use the specific advantages of each system.

===Integrated constructed wetland===
An integrated constructed wetland is an unlined free surface flow constructed wetland with emergent vegetated areas and local soil material. Its objectives is not only to treat wastewater from farmyards and other wastewater sources, but also to integrate the wetland infrastructure into the landscape and enhancing its biological diversity.

Integrated constructed wetland facilitates may be more robust treatment systems compared to other constructed wetlands. This is due to the greater biological complexity and generally relatively larger land area use and associated longer hydraulic residence time of integrated constructed wetland compared to conventional constructed wetlands.

Integrated constructed wetlands are used in Ireland, the UK and the United States since about 2007. Farm constructed wetlands, which are a subtype of integrated constructed wetlands, are promoted by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency since 2008.

=== Other design aspects ===
The design of a constructed wetland can greatly effect the surrounding environment. A wide range of skills and knowledge is needed in the construction and can easily be detrimental to the site if not done correctly. A long list of professions ranging from civil engineers to hydrologists to wildlife biologists to landscape architects are needed in this design process. The landscape architect can utilize a wide range of skills to help accomplish the task of constructing a wetland that may not be thought of by other professions. Ecological landscape architects are also qualified to create wetland restoration designs in coordination with wetland scientists that increase the community value and appreciation of a project through well designed access, interpretation, and views of the project. Landscape architecture has a long history of engagement with the aesthetic dimension of wetlands. Landscape architects also guide through the laws and regulations associated with constructing a wetland.

==Plants and other organisms==
===Plants===
&quot;Typhas&quot; and &quot;Phragmites&quot; are the main species used in constructed wetland due to their effectiveness, even though they can be invasive outside their native range.

In North America, cattails (&quot;Typha latifolia&quot;) are common in constructed wetlands because of their widespread abundance, ability to grow at different water depths, ease of transport and transplantation, and broad tolerance of water composition (including pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and contaminant concentrations). Elsewhere, Common Reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;) are common (both in blackwater treatment but also in greywater treatment systems to purify wastewater).

Plants are usually indigenous in that location for ecological reasons and optimum workings.

===Animals===
Locally grown non-predatory fish can be added to surface flow constructed wetlands to eliminate or reduce pests, such as mosquitos.

Stormwater wetlands provide habitat for amphibians but the pollutants they accumulate can affect the survival of larval stages, potentially making them function as &quot;ecological traps&quot;.

== Costs ==
Since constructed wetlands are self-sustaining their lifetime costs are significantly lower than those of conventional treatment systems. Often their capital costs are also lower compared to conventional treatment systems. They do take up significant space, and are therefore not preferred where real estate costs are high.

== History ==
Primary clarifier effluent was discharged directly to natural wetlands for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with sand filter beds have their origin in China and are now used in Asia in small cities.

== Examples ==

=== Austria ===
The total number of constructed wetlands in Austria is 5,450 (in 2015). Due to legal requirements (nitrification), only vertical flow constructed wetlands are implemented in Austria as they achieve better nitrification performance than horizontal flow constructed wetlands. Only about 100 of these constructed wetlands have a design size of 50 population equivalents or more. The remaining 5,350 treatment plants are smaller than that.

=== Canada ===
As part of the remediation efforts to remove contamination from CFB Goose Bay, one of the waste dumps was transformed into an engineered wetland.

<text>The fourth Hawke ministry (Labor) was the 57th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 23rd Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. The fourth Hawke ministry succeeded the third Hawke ministry, which dissolved on 4 April 1990 following the federal election that took place on 24 March. The ministry was replaced by the first Keating ministry on 20 December 1991 following the resignation of Hawke as Prime Minister after a successful leadership challenge by Paul Keating.

<text>Forest Hill is a district of the London Borough of Lewisham in south east London, England, on the South Circular Road, which is home to the Horniman Museum.

== History ==

Like much of Greater London, Forest Hill was only sparsely populated until the mid-19th century. The name Forest Hill, originally simply &quot;The Forest&quot;, referred to the woodland which once covered the area and which was a relict part of the Great North Wood.

In 1809, the Croydon Canal opened, however, the large number of locks (28) meant it was not a commercial success, and it was bought by the London &amp; Croydon Railway Company who used the alignment to construct the London Bridge to Croydon railway line opening in 1839. The ponds in the Dacres Wood Nature Reserve and the retaining wall of the footpath opposite the station outside The Signal pub are about the only physical evidence of the canal which still exist.

When the Crystal Palace was moved from Hyde Park to Sydenham in 1854, many large homes were built on the western end of Forest Hill along with Honor Oak. In 1884, London&#x27;s oldest swimming pool was constructed on Dartmouth Road. The tea merchant Frederick Horniman built a museum to house his collection of natural history artifacts. He donated the building and its gardens to the public in 1901 and this became the Horniman Museum.

== Local area ==

=== Amenities ===

Horniman Museum is home to anthropological and cultural collections, an aquarium and one of the most varied collections of taxidermy in the northern hemisphere including the worlds first taxidermy of a walrus. It also houses one of the finest collection of musical instruments in the British Isles. Contained within its accompanying gardens is an animal enclosure, flower gardens, and a Grade II listed early 20th century conservatory. Views from the gardens stretch out over central and north London.

Following a successful and widely supported campaign from local group Save The Face Of Forest Hill, Louise House was designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage.

Forest Hill Library was built in 1901 to an Arts and Crafts design by local architect Alexander Hennell. It is one of over 500 Grade II listed buildings in Lewisham Borough. It was refurbished in 2008.

=== Recreation ===
A few parks are located in and around in Forest Hill. Horniman Triangle Park is located directly opposite Horniman Museum and Gardens, with Tarleton Gardens close by. Blythe Hill is located on the border with Catford, while in Sydenham, Baxter Field, Mayow Park and Sydenham Hill Woods are located on the border with Forest Hill.

Alongside Sydenham Hill Woods, is the Dulwich and Sydenham Golf course, dating back to 1893. There are three nature reserves in Forest Hill: Dacres Wood, Devonshire Road and Garthorne Road. Dacres Wood Nature Reserve is open on the last Saturday of each month and Devonshire Road Nature Reserve on the last Sunday of the month.

=== Architecture ===
With a range of architectural styles spanning the late 19th and 20th centuries, Forest Hill was described by Sir Norman Foster as &quot;a delightful pocket of South London&quot;. Of particular note are the Capitol Cinema (latterly a JD Wetherspoon pub), the Horniman Museum, and classic art deco mansion blocks Forest Croft and Taymount Grange.

== Education ==
There are nine primary schools in SE23 (Dalmain, Fairlawn, Holy Trinity, Horniman, Kilmorie, Perrymount, St George&#x27;s, St William of York), one specialist through school (Brent Knoll) and one secondary school (Forest Hill School for boys). Eliot Bank primary and Sydenham School (for girls) is close by in Upper Sydenham. There are no private schools in Forest Hill; however, Dulwich College, James Allen&#x27;s Girls, St Dunstans and Sydenham High are in surrounding areas. Furthermore, there are no colleges in Forest Hill; however, Forest Hill and Sydenham schools have a joint sixth form.

<doc id="1202871" wikidata="Q2737135" url="?curid=1202871" title="Pac-Man World 2">
<text>is a platform video game developed and published by Namco Hometek. It was released for the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2 in 2002. A version of the game for Microsoft Windows was released in 2004, and an abridged version for the Game Boy Advance was released in 2005. The game is a sequel to &quot;Pac-Man World&quot; (1999). The player controls Pac-Man in a 3D platforming environment, through six worlds. In 2005, a sequel, &quot;Pac-Man World 3&quot;, was released.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Pac-Man World 2&quot; is a 3D platforming game in which the player controls Pac-Man and must navigate him to the end of each level. The player can use multiple abilities; these include the Rev Roll, a move where the player charges forward, which can be used to attack enemies and cross gaps; the Butt-Bounce, which can press switches and attack enemies from above; and a jumping Flip Kick to strike airborne enemies. Each level features Pac-Dots and fruit to collect, which will increase the player&#x27;s score for the level. Collecting special Power Pellets will also give Pac-Man temporary power-ups. These power-ups can turn Pac-Man into metal, sinking him into water and making him immune to hazards; shrink him, allowing access to certain parts of a level; or temporarily allow him to eat ghost enemies. Pac-Man possesses a health bar with only three segments; if he takes damage after all three segments are depleted, the player will lose a life and be sent back to the previous checkpoint. After completing any non-boss level, the player can choose to replay it in Time Trial mode, challenging the player to reach the end as quickly as possible. During the time trial, fruits and other collectibles in the level are replaced by clocks, which will temporarily stop the timer if collected. If Pac-Man loses a life during the time trial, he must restart the level from the beginning.

The game features twenty-five levels. These include a tutorial level set in Pac-Man&#x27;s home of Pac-Village, followed by six different themed areas with four levels each. The last level of each of these areas feature a boss battle with one or more of the primary ghost enemies, who must be defeated to advance. Certain levels feature unique gameplay mechanics. Some equip Pac-Man with ice skates or roller blades, impacting speed and movement. Others feature automatically-scrolling levels set underwater, in which Pac-Man can swim to avoid obstacles or pilot a submarine equipped with torpedoes. Most levels feature one of 16 collectible Galaxian flagships, which will allow Pac-Man to play a bonus maze level, similar in gameplay to &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980). Non-boss levels also feature collectible arcade tokens; eight are hidden in each level, while bonus tokens can be earned by collecting all the fruit and Pac-Dots in a level and completing time trials. By collecting certain numbers of tokens, players can unlock emulated versions of older &quot;Pac-Man&quot; titles in the Pac-Village arcade, including &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Pac-Attack&quot; (1993), &quot;Pac-Mania&quot; (1987), and &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; (1982). Collecting tokens will also unlock a jukebox, which enables the player to listen to the game&#x27;s soundtrack, and a concept art gallery.

The Game Boy Advance version of the game is considerably different from the other versions of the game. It plays from an isometric view, and uses 2D sprites for graphics and a password-based save system. The underwater stages were omitted from this version, while an additional boss was added. In addition, the emulated games are not included.

Subsequent re-releases of the game rebalanced the gameplay to tone down the game&#x27;s difficulty. For the game&#x27;s Japanese PlayStation 2 release, further changes were made to reduce difficulty, including shortening certain levels and reducing bosses&#x27; health.

==Story==
Hundreds of years prior to the game&#x27;s events, the evil ghost king Spooky terrorized Pac-Land and the Pac-People. To stop him, the Great Wizard Pac created a powerful potion to transform five ordinary fruit into magical Golden Fruit. The knight Sir Pac-A-Lot defeated Spooky in battle, and used the Golden Fruit to seal him under a tree in the center of Pac-Village.

In the present day, Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde sneak into Pac-Village at night to cause mischief. They steal the Golden Fruit from the tree, unaware of its purpose, and unwittingly release Spooky, who commands them to aid his plan to eliminate all Pac-People. The ghosts agree and each take one of the Golden Fruit. The next morning, Professor Pac informs Pac-Man of the trouble and asks him to retrieve the stolen Golden Fruit in order to save Pac-Land. Pac-Man travels throughout Pac-Land and across the ocean to Ghost Island, defeating the ghosts and retrieving the Golden Fruit along the way. Pac-Man eventually returns to Pac-Village, where he is ambushed by Spooky. The power of the Golden Fruit transforms Pac-Man into a new golden form, and he defeats Spooky once more, sealing him back beneath the tree. The residents of Pac-Village emerge to congratulate Pac-Man, while his dog Chomp-Chomp overhears the ghosts planning to free Spooky again and chases them out of the village.

==Reception==
&quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 56th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of &quot;Pac-Man World&quot; games released in the 2000s reached 1.8 million units in the United States by July 2006.

The GameCube version of &quot;Pac-Man World 2&quot; has an average score of 73.83% on GameRankings. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions each have an average score of 68.18% and 67.69% respectively. The Game Boy Advance version has a score of 41.67%. The GameCube version became a Player&#x27;s Choice title, the PlayStation 2 version became a Greatest Hits title and the Xbox version became a Platinum Hits title. The game also has a score of eight on GameSpot for the PS2 version, a 7.9 for the Gamecube version, and a 7.5 for the Xbox version. The game&#x27;s camera system received criticism, but the musical score was praised. NGC Magazine gave the game 70% rating giving praise to the level and boss designs although criticizing the poor camera system and the gameplay being similar to the Mario games. &quot;Pac-Man World 2&quot; was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Platformer on Xbox&quot; award, which went to &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;.

The Player&#x27;s Choice edition of the GameCube version included &quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot; as a bonus pack-in in North America. Also for North America in 2008, &quot;Pac-Man World 2&quot;, along with &quot;Pac-Man World 3&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man World Rally&quot;, were included in a 3-pack called the &quot;Pac-Man Power Pack&quot; for the PlayStation 2.

<doc id="1202872" wikidata="Q2407464" url="?curid=1202872" title="Hannington, Northamptonshire">
<text>Hannington is a village in West Northamptonshire in England. At the time of the 2011 census the parish&#x27;s population was 251 people.

== Ancient history of Hannington and the Church of St Peter and St Paul ==
The villages name means &#x27;Farm/settlement connected with Hana&#x27;.

The parish of Hannington has been inhabited for a much greater period of time than many people may realise. Evidence exists from the Bronze Age and from the time of the Roman occupation and also later from the Medieval period. Bronze Age worked flints have been found at three locations in the parish, and there are traces of a Roman settlement just north of the present day village where Roman pottery has been found.

Just east of the church, an area of around two hectares shows signs of a medieval settlement which appears to have consisted of enclosures or paddocks, formerly part of the village itself. Hannington was mentioned in the Domesday book, and it is of note that the parish was then much smaller than most settlements in the area as it continues to be today.

The church, once a major part of village life, was built in the late 13th century, though it incorporates some stonework from an earlier period. At the time of construction the church was &quot;in the gift&quot; of the Gilbertine Order of Sempringham in Lincolnshire. The Gilbertines are thought to have provided the first priests in exchange for annual tithes from the village. The arrangement of the nave with its two central pillars and three arches or arcades, may have been influenced by the plan of Sempringham Priory, started just 100 years previously and incorporating a central wall which separated the canons (monks) and their accommodation from the nuns and their dormitory and refectory. It has been suggested that a monastic cell existed in Hannington and also that when Archbishop Thomas Becket fled from the King and the General Council in 1164, accompanied by Gilbertine canons, he stayed overnight in Hannington. There is no documentary evidence to support either belief. It is believed that Becket left St Andrew&#x27;s Priory, Northampton in the evening and was in Lincoln the following day.

The church of St Peter and St Paul is one of only two in England with a bisected nave; the other is at Caythorpe in Lincolnshire. The latter had a north aisle added in Victorian times, spoiling the symmetry. St Peter and St Paul, Hannington, could therefore be considered to be unique in England. The delicate medieval screen now enclosing the vestry was originally placed across the arch separating the chancel (occupied only by the priest and assistants), from the nave (used by the people). The oak pulpit is of similar age.

In 1562 Thomas Godwin became Rector of Hannington. In the same year he baptised his baby son Francis in Hannington&#x27;s church. The Reverend Thomas left to become Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and eventually Bishop of Bath and Wells. His son Francis became Bishop of Hereford and wrote the first science-fiction novel in the English language, &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot;, a fascinating read with amazing predictions.

By the mid 19th century the church had fallen into a serious state of disrepair and was little more than a ruin, but thankfully in 1869 the building was restored to its former glory and a new Rectory was built alongside it. The person responsible for this was the Rector, John Downes. He personally paid for the restoration and for the building of the Rectory, now called Hannington House. It was John Downes&#x27; wife Lucy who founded the school in Hannington in 1871, and this school building still exists and is used as the Village Hall. A portrait of Lucy Downes hangs in the building to this day, having been donated by the family in the 1970s. John Downes is perhaps one of the village&#x27;s most notable past residents. A graduate of Cambridge University, he studied botany with Professor Henshaw alongside Charles Darwin. It is believed that Downes had been offered the position of botanist on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; which he declined, as his vocation was in the Church. He then went on to become a parish priest. This role of botanist was then taken on by Darwin. But John Downes is famous in his own right for his work, and from time to time Hannington receives visitors interested in his background. There is a memorial to John Downes, his wife and his daughter in the church in the form of a stained glass window in the east wall.
Clearly the church would have been at the heart of village life in Hannington. However, since 1954 the village has shared a vicar with the neighbouring parishes of Walgrave and Old, and more recently, Scaldwell. Older villagers can recall there being a good congregation and a choir made up of local boys. At one time there was also a Chapel in the village situated close to West Farm. Now, in common with many village churches, the congregation of the church is modest and the majority of villagers are not involved.

== Local environment ==
Hannington was described in the late 19th century in John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as: 
A brook runs through the parish which feeds the nearby Pitsford Reservoir and there is a large fishing lake to the north of the village.

The pocket park was established in 1996 and it lies to the south of the village. This is a wooded area of around a third of an acre and a variety of flora and fauna can be found there at different times of the year.
Historic traces of ridge and furrow can be found in the majority of the fields surrounding Hannington, although this cannot always be seen from the ground.

== Population and buildings ==
Although the architecture of the village and the families inhabiting it have changed enormously over the years, the population had not risen hugely until fairly recently, reaching a peak in 1861 before declining again into the next century and then rising rapidly once more during recent years. With the exception of the church and the village hall, the buildings with a historical focus were either demolished or have been converted into homes. The Millstone (once a public house), The Old Forge, and The Bakehouse are three examples of this. Surprisingly few of these older dwellings are listed buildings.
The village school closed its doors in 1931 and most children of the parish now attend Walgrave Primary School, going on to Moulton School or other schools in the surrounding towns. However, as one local amenity was lost another was born as the building subsequently became the Village Hall. There was also once a village shop in Hannington.

== Employment in the village ==
Being a rural settlement, the majority of Hannington residents were once agricultural workers, both living and working in the community. Tending to the animals and of course farming the land, were jobs which people had been occupied with in and around the village, probably for centuries. The villagers were almost entirely self-sufficient, obtaining their meat, eggs, milk, and other supplies from farms in the parish and ensuring that everything available was used in some way.

Farming became increasingly mechanised in the early 20th century leading to job losses on the farms and people began to look for jobs outside the village. A shoe factory in Walgrave employed people from several villages in the area, and being only a mile from Hannington this was a convenient place for residents looking for local work. However, car ownership became more common and villagers now find work in Kettering, Northampton, and beyond.

Out of nine functioning farms in the community last century only one, Poplars Farm, continues to be actively farmed from within the village. West Farm, Mere Farm and Manor Farm are just some of those that ceased farming in Hannington during recent decades. Many different types of farming occurred here until recently, including dairy, poultry, livestock and arable. The staple crops produced, mainly being wheat and barley, are those we still see produced today in the surrounding area.
It is now very unusual to find someone who both lives and works in a village the size of Hannington. Some people do work from their homes, either part-time or full-time. The relatively recent addition of business units on Red House Lane does now make both living and working in Hannington a possibility

== Hannington in wartime ==
During World War II, Hannington had a narrow escape when bombs were dropped on Red House Lane close to the A43 road. Some older residents remember that glass was blown from the windows of the nearby farmhouse and large craters were left, but luckily the village itself was unscathed.

At this time, land between the nearby villages of Harrington and Lamport was used as an airfield for an American air base. Planes from this airfield, including bombers, flew regularly near the parish. During this time a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress crashed at the Walgrave turning on the A43 leaving all of the American crew dead. Remains and fragments of this incident have subsequently been discovered in the area.

== Village celebrations and fetes ==
There were at one time two village events per year in Hannington, held at Poplars Farm and in the Rectory gardens (Hannington House). People would come in fancy dress and it was a time when all villagers could come together, adults and children, to enjoy a shared social event.

May Day was also celebrated by decorating prams or baskets with flowers and parading a &quot;May Queen&quot;. The children would sing and this was followed by tea in the Village Hall.

Barn dances were held at Poplars Farm until fairly recently, and were well attended by residents from the village and the surrounding area.

In 1977, the Silver Jubilee was celebrated in the village and a bed of 25 rose bushes was planted to mark the event. This rose bed is still flourishing on Main Street by West Farm Close.

== Services and amenities in Hannington ==
In the past there were two public houses in the parish; the Millstone in the village and The Red House at the edge of the parish on the A43. The Red House was a well used pub not only by residents of Hannington but also by residents of neighbouring Hardwick and passing motorists. The Red House has undergone several name changes over the last decade and was most recently known as &quot;Henry’s&quot;. It is now derelict.

The Millstone had a long tradition as a public house in the centre of the village, used by generations of farmers and villagers. It once had a popular skittles room and was the major social amenity in the village until its closure in 1938. Residents of Walgrave also visited the pub. Now a private home, this most attractive building lost its thatch in the 1960s. The stonework reflects various periods of building when the property was extended and there is an old dovecote in the back garden, now in a state of disrepair, that harks back to a much earlier time when this was a way to ensure fresh meat.

The petrol station on the A43 has been there for many years and was recently rebuilt. Mains water was not available in the village until just after the war and previously it had to be fetched from wells at locations such as The Millstone, the Schoolhouse, or Poplars Farm, where there was a pump. Washing was often done using rainwater. Some properties have wells to this day but they are not used. As for sanitation, earth closets were still in use until the main sewer was installed.
As mentioned previously there was a village shop next door to The Millstone House. A local green grocer also visited the village on Saturdays and provided fish, fruit and vegetables. A butcher from Moulton paid regular visits, too. People certainly did not have to travel out of the village to buy their provisions even if they did not obtain them from the local farms.

The doctor came to the village about three times a week, and if people needed medical attention a note had to be left until the next visit. There was also a district nurse, and like today, doctors were available in the nearby villages of Brixworth and Moulton.

Today an hourly bus service operates through the village travelling to Northampton and Kettering, although the majority of residents travel by car to reach the services and amenities which are no longer available in the village.

Although travel outside the parish is now necessary for most things, a mobile library still visits the Hannington on a weekly basis.

== Changes to the appearance of the village ==
Behind the Jubilee Rose Bed in Main Street once stood an old stone barn, which was demolished to make way for West Farm Close. Turners Farm, which included a large farmhouse on the corner of School Lane, was demolished earlier. This had been the last thatched house in the village until the modern Turners Farm Close was built to include two thatched buildings. Turners Farm Close, Orchard Close and West Farm Close are all relatively new housing developments.

Many small cottages have been lost on almost every street in the village, or combined to make larger dwellings. A chapel built in 1865 no longer stands on Main Street. It was once used by the village undertaker and later converted to a garage and workshop in 1972.

Main Street once curved sharply at the junction of Main Street and Bridle Road and was a very dangerous road. It has since been straightened out and there is now a small green which was created after diverting the road.
The church clock has not always been in its current position either. It once overlooked the Holcot Road and a small window can now be seen where the clock originally was. The window was fitted with glass after the removal of the clock.

<doc id="1202875" wikidata="Q7419543" url="?curid=1202875" title="Santa Fe Pacific Corporation">
<text>The Santa Fe Pacific Corporation was formed as the Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation on by the merger of Santa Fe Industries, which owned the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, with the Southern Pacific Company, which owned the Southern Pacific Railroad.

Santa Fe Southern Pacific sold its 520,000 acres of northern California timberland to Sierra Pacific Industries in 1987.

After the Interstate Commerce Commission denied their plan to merge their railroads as the Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad, the holding company name was shortened, and the Southern Pacific Railroad sold.

The holding company retained all the non-rail interests of both predecessors; these were mainly real estate and natural resources, but Southern Pacific had also formed the telephone company known as Sprint, which was sold shortly before the merger. It was initially headquartered in Chicago and later in Schaumburg, Illinois. Former Southern Pacific executive Robert Krebs succeeded Santa Fe head John J. Schmidt as CEO. 

Almost immediately after the Southern Pacific was sold, Santa Fe Pacific issued a massive dividend. It was so large that it was considered a return of capital, and financed by issuing a large amount of debt. A few years after that, they spun off most of the company&#x27;s natural resources interests as Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. They also spun off all their non-track real estate interests, including railway stations, as Catellus Development.

In September 1995 what was left of the company merged into Burlington Northern. The Santa Fe railroad became part of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Robert Krebs was CEO of the merged company, until his retirement.

The Santa Fe Pacific Corporation was not related to the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad, which operated from 1897 to 1902.

<text>The U and V class was a class of sixteen destroyers of the Royal Navy launched in 1942–1943. They were constructed in two flotillas, each with names beginning with &quot;U-&quot; or &quot;V-&quot; (although there was a return to the pre-war practice of naming the designated flotilla leader after a famous naval figure from history to honour the lost ships &quot;Grenville&quot; and &quot;Hardy&quot;). The hull was nearly identical to the preceding ships of the S and T classes, but the U and V class ships had different bridge and armament fits. The flotillas constituted the 7th Emergency Flotilla and 8th Emergency Flotilla, built under the War Emergency Programme. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer.

<doc id="1202880" wikidata="Q551161" url="?curid=1202880" title="C. J. Ramone">
<text>Christopher Joseph Ward (born October 8, 1965), better known as C. J. Ramone, is an American musician. He is best known for performing from 1989 to 1996 as the bassist, backing vocalist and occasional lead vocalist of the punk rock group the Ramones after replacing original bassist Dee Dee Ramone, a role that lasted until the band&#x27;s retirement.

==Background==
Christopher Joseph Ward was born in Queens, New York City, but lived in Deer Park, New York for most of his early life. He attended Ss. Cyril and Methodius School and graduated from Deer Park High School in 1983.

Prior to joining the Ramones, Ward served in the United States Marine Corps but lost the title of Marine due to going absent without leave and discharged. He was a fan of the Ramones, particularly of Dee Dee Ramone, before joining the band, and later played with him in a band called the Ramainz, which was formed by Dee Dee Ramone, Marky Ramone and Dee Dee&#x27;s wife, Barbara Zampini.

He also played in Guitar Pete&#x27;s Axe Attack, Los Gusanos, Bad Chopper. Ward released the album &quot;Reconquista&quot; on June 29, 2012, and his album &quot;Last Chance to Dance&quot; was released in November (United States) and December (Europe) 2014. &quot;American Beauty&quot; was released on March 17, 2017, in the United States. &quot;The Holy Spell&quot; was released in 2019.

==Ramones==

Ward replaced original band member Dee Dee Ramone, though Dee Dee continued to write songs for the band. Ward went to the audition with the sole purpose of jamming with the Ramones; he was not &quot;nervous or intimidated&quot; as he had no intention of getting the job but much to his surprise, he did. After being discharged from the Marines and learning 40 Ramones songs in five weeks, Ward played his first live show with the band on September 30, 1989. Adjusting to the Ramones&#x27; play style was one of the biggest challenges he had, as Ward was originally a fingerstyle bassist as opposed to Dee Dee&#x27;s signature downpicking technique. He eventually learned to adapt by lowering his bass down to his kneecap and wearing sweatbands to protect his wrists.

Ward sang many well-known Ramones songs and gave the band a younger image. In the documentary &quot;End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones&quot; it is stated that when Ward joined the Ramones he was seen as a breath of fresh air into the band. Johnny Ramone says he knew immediately when Ward auditioned to replace Dee Dee that he was right, commenting that he &quot;had the right look&quot;. When the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame original Ramones drummer, Tommy Ramone, credited Ward with &quot;keeping the band young&quot;.

Ward was the youngest member of the Ramones when he joined, by nine years. He also shared a birthday, October 8, with bandmate Johnny Ramone. While Ward&#x27;s first live show with the Ramones was on September 30, 1989, in Leicester, England, his official debut with the band was actually three weeks earlier on September 4 during the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon that aired on WWOR-TV in New York. Ward played with the band until they disbanded on August 6, 1996.

==Equipment==

Ward used Ampeg SVT amplifiers for most of his career, having inherited several amps from Dee Dee Ramone. However, he has since switched to Fender Bassman amps, stating that the Ampeg amps had &quot;substantial historical value&quot; and he wished to preserve them.

Prior to joining the Ramones, Ward played an early &#x27;70s Fender Jazz Bass and always played fingerstyle, explaining in a 2015 interview with Fender that he stopped at a music store to buy picks on his way to first meet the band. When he joined the Ramones, they gave him a black Mexican Fender Precision Bass, with a white pickguard and a maple neck and that was his main bass for the first gigs with the Ramones. He also had two cream Fender Precision basses, one with a white pickguard and another with a black. (These basses can be seen in various backstage photos.) He then bought a white American Fender Precision with a white pickguard (later switched to a black to make it look more like Dee Dee&#x27;s bass guitars). Then he finally got a vintage 1979 Fender Precision, like the basses that Dee Dee used to play. He would mainly use that bass for the rest of his time in the Ramones.

While with the Ramones, Ward also had a custom-made Mosrite Bass made for him by Semie Moseley, white with a tortoiseshell pickguard. He used it while with Bad Chopper and has since sold this bass. He then used a Mosrite bass that he designed with Mr. Yuasa of the Filmore Company, the Mosrite copyright owner in Japan. It was white with a black pickguard. This bass was stolen when Ward toured Japan in February 2010.

Currently, Ward plays a Fender Dee Dee Ramone signature model Precision Basses.

==Other bands==
Before the Ramones, Ward played in a heavy metal band called Guitar Pete&#x27;s Axe Attack, where he appeared on two albums. In 1992, while still with the Ramones, he started a hard rock band named Los Gusanos. They released a few singles before releasing their only album in 1997, which was worked on by Ramones producer Daniel Rey. After the Ramones&#x27; retirement Ward played a few shows with the Ramainz, a Ramones tribute band formed by Dee Dee Ramone, Marky Ramone and Dee Dee&#x27;s wife Barbara Zampini. In 1998, Los Gusanos broke up, leading to Ward&#x27;s next band the Warm Jets, which released one single before changing their name due to another band with the same name. As Bad Chopper, they released a single and in 2007, a self-titled album. The band broke up in summer 2009. From 2009 to 2019, he toured just as CJ Ramone with rotating members on guitar and drums. He released four albums and a single as CJ Ramone. Since 2018, he has filled in on bass at live shows for Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. He also sometimes plays with the Aquabats live shows.

== Personal life ==
Ward was married to Marky Ramone&#x27;s niece, Chessa Au, with whom he has two children. He is now married to lawyer Denise Barton, with whom he has one daughter.

<text>Sir Herbert Douglas Ellis, (3 January 1924 – 11 October 2018) was an English entrepreneur. He was the chairman of Aston Villa Football Club from 1968 to 1975, and again from 1982 until 2006. Ellis was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours List for charitable services.

==Early life and career==
Ellis was born on 3 January 1924 in Hooton, Cheshire. When he was three years old, his father, also named Herbert, died. His mother Jane did not remarry but worked to support him and his younger sister, and paid his fares to attend secondary school in Chester.

According to Ellis, he attended trials for a football career with Tranmere Rovers as a child, but chose to pursue his business career rather than football. During World War II, he was based with the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and the experience of his first trip abroad inspired him to provide low-cost foreign holidays to people of a similar economic background. Before he was 40, he had become a millionaire by pioneering package holidays to Spain, with his company Sunflight.

Ellis met his first wife Audrey Slater in Ceylon in 1946. They had a son together and later divorced. He married his second wife Heidi Kroeger in 1963, with whom he had two sons. He met the German courier in Benidorm when she was working for a rival company, and persuaded her to join his corporation.

==Sport==
Ellis was the chairman and major shareholder of Aston Villa for two separate spells, the first being from 1968 to 1975. Ellis was replaced as chairman and finally ousted from the board in 1979. During his absence, Aston Villa enjoyed its greatest period of success in modern times, winning the Football League title in 1981 and the European Cup in 1982. In June 1982, Ellis ousted Harry Marshall as chairman of Wolverhampton Wanderers. At the time, he noted the club was 24 hours from extinction, with debt as high as £2.5m. In November 1982, he was elected to the board of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.

Ellis returned to Aston Villa as chairman in 1982, and remained there until selling to Randy Lerner in 2006. Some fans blame him for the decline of the club after the European Cup victory in 1981–82. Within five years, the club was relegated from the top flight, with many of the European Cup-winning team being sold to other teams, although it can be argued that this was due to large debts built up during the previous regime.

Ellis was nicknamed &quot;Deadly Doug&quot; by football pundit Jimmy Greaves, after sacking numerous managers during his tenures as chairman. Aston Villa had 13 different managers during his two spells. Only two won any trophies for the team – Ron Atkinson and Brian Little with the Football League Cup in 1994 and 1996 respectively.

In 1996, Ellis owned 47 per cent of Aston Villa. In May 1997, the club floated on the stock market with a valuation of £126m. Ellis sold a number of his shares at flotation, reducing his shareholding to around 39% of the total shares.

Ellis was reported to be the first football club director to pay himself a salary (in 2005 it was £290,000 after a 12% increase from the previous year) when it was made legal by The Football Association in the early 1980s. He also served on the boards of Birmingham City, Derby County and Wolverhampton Wanderers (as chairman).

In 2004, at the age of 80 and suffering from prostate cancer, Ellis agreed to relinquish some of his control of the club by appointing Bruce Langham as chief executive. Langham resigned in May 2005, reportedly after a disagreement with Ellis. In 2005, underwent a heart bypass operation and, after a three-month absence, returned to his role at Villa Park soon after the start of the 2005–06 season. By this time, some supporters and former club managers criticised Ellis&#x27;s alleged lack of ambition, noting that the club often struggled to bring in top players.

On 14 August 2006, it was announced that Ellis had agreed to sell the club to American billionaire, Randy Lerner in a deal worth £62.6 million. Ellis stood aside when the takeover was completed on 19 September 2006, becoming a President Emeritus (Life President) of the club.

==Honours and later life==
In 1994, a stand at Villa Park was named after Ellis. and in 2005, he was appointed an OBE in the 2005 New Year Honours List.

Ellis received an honorary degree from Aston University in July 2007. In January 2012 the Doug Ellis Learning Hub was opened at the University of Birmingham Medical School. Ellis donated £416,000 towards the feature. In April 2013, the newly refurbished Sir Doug Ellis Woodcock Sports Centre at Aston University opened, featuring a new sports hall and squash courts. This work was partly funded by Ellis. Also in 2012, Ellis donated £10,000 to the building of a new school gymnasium at Sutton Coldfield Grammar School for Girls. In his letter to the school, he wrote: &quot;You clearly have a school to be proud of … and I wish you every success in achieving your goal&quot;.

On 4 March 2012, Ellis was knighted for his charity work. He died on 11 October 2018, aged 94.

<text>The Second Fisher ministry (Australian Labor Party) was the 8th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 5th Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher. The Second Fisher ministry succeeded the Third Deakin ministry, which dissolved on 29 April 1910 following the federal election that took place on 13 April which saw Labor defeat the Alfred Deakin&#x27;s Liberal Party. It is the first federal government in Australian history to be elected with a majority in the House of Representatives, as well as the first majority national Labor government in the world. The ministry was replaced by the Cook ministry on 24 June 1913 following the federal election that took place in May which saw the Liberals defeat Labor.

King O&#x27;Malley, who died in 1953, was the last surviving member of the Second Fisher ministry; O&#x27;Malley was also the last surviving member of the First Hughes ministry.

<text>Hanging Houghton is a small village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Lamport, in the West Northamptonshire district, in the ceremonial county of Northamptonshire, England. It is on the A508 road between Brixworth and Lamport. In 1931 the parish had a population of 84.

== History ==
The villages name means &#x27;Houghton (= hill-spur farm/settlement) on a steep slope&#x27;.

In 1866 Hanging Houghton became a civil parish, on 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished and merged with Lamport.

==Great house and gardens==
Hanging Houghton was the location of a great house and gardens, which although no longer present is listed as a scheduled monument as part of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. This monument encompasses the now buried and the earthwork remains of the house and gardens, and is in the south west area of the village.

From 1471 until it was abandoned in 1665 the house was owned by the Montague family. It is shown on a map in 1655 as having highly elaborate formal gardens including a knot garden and several terraced walks. The ruins of the house survived into the late 18th century, but all that now remains is a rectangular building platform measuring 40 metres by 30 metres in the north east corner of the land. Contemporary illustrations suggest the house was of typical late-16th-century design with three bays and a symmetrical south elevation with central porch. Nothing of the gardens remain other than a series of rectangular areas noticeable by shallow banks and earthworks measuring less than 1 metre in height.

==Listed buildings==
The village is home to five Grade II listed buildings:
*A K6 telephone box on Manor Road
*The Hanging Houghton School House
*Clint Hill Farmhouse
*Manor Farmhouse
*Numbers 18,19 and 20 Manor Road

==The Domesday Book==
Hanging Houghton was referenced as a settlement in the Domesday Book of 1086. It was recorded as having a population of 30 households. The book recorded the households, owners, resources and land value as follows:

== History ==

 was founded in Hamburg in 1946 by the British occupying forces, aiming to provide a &quot;quality newspaper&quot; modelled on &quot;The Times&quot;. It originally carried news and British-viewpoint editorial content, but from 1947 it adopted a policy of providing two leading articles on major questions, one British and one German. The newspaper was bought by Axel Springer in 1953.

== Criticism ==
&quot;Die Welt&quot; has repeatedly been criticized for publishing climate-sceptic articles. A study published in 2017 that examined the publications of various newspapers over a period of one year from June 2012 to May 2013, found that 43% of articles included in the sample for the publication were climate-sceptical, having the highest climate-sceptical value of all German newspapers.

During the COVID-19-pandemic, the newspaper was criticized by the Amadeu Antonio Foundation for adopting right-wing populist talking points and publishing misinformation about COVID-19.

Liz Fekete criticized the newspaper in 2024 for uncritically adopting Israel&#x27;s talking points on the Middle East conflict, to the disadvantage of Palestinians, and spreading false information about the prevalence of antisemitism among immigrants.

In December 2024, opinion department chief Eva Marie Kogel left &quot;Die Welt&quot; protesting the publication of an op-ed by Elon Musk that supports AfD.

<text>Guilsborough is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 882 people, reducing to 692 at the 2011 Census.

It is at the centre of an area of rural villages between the towns of Northampton, Daventry, Rugby and Market Harborough. There is a secondary school, primary school, fire station, pub, a new village shop including a Post Office (formerly the doctor&#x27;s surgery) and a new doctor&#x27;s surgery with pharmacy and a Hairdressers.

==History==
The villages name means &#x27;Gyldi&#x27;s fortification&#x27;. The hundred is named after Guilsborough, but the site of the meeting-place is unknown.

Guilsborough is made up of two hamlets, now joined. Guilsborough (Guildesburgh) and Nortoft. The former referring to the Roman fort, or referencing the earlier Late Bronze Age/Iron Age Enclosure on the same site. Possibility of the name deriving from a later Anglo-Saxon base word &#x27;gebeorgan&#x27; (enclosure to save/protect/preserve) given there was an Anglo Saxon settlement over the Late Bronze Age/Iron Age followed by Roman, and the Anglo-Saxon fortified enclosures. The Church Mount road housing stands where Guilsborough Hall once stood. The mound under the water tower in the grounds of the historic Guilsborough Park is part of a Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age enclosure (RCHME 1981) being fifth century BC to first century BC with later Roman occupation. Subsequent excavation cites evidence of there being a strongly defended univallate fort of late first Millennium BC. Other remains of the enclosure (northern ramparts) still exist in paddocks to the north-east and east of the mound Potential Iron Age iron production site. Whilst most of the southern rampart was destroyed in 1947 and possibly during an earlier episode, some remnants may exist. The Roman fort was an outpost of the settlement at West Haddon and the Guilsborough encampment is believed to have been the work of Publius Ostorius Scapula, under the reign of Claudius. When the south rampart was removed in the 19th century, many skeletons were found. The whole site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (in process - Northamptonshire Sites and Monument Records). The Guilsborough Park landscape related to the former Guilsborough Hall. Various significant trees and tree groups remain (with TPO&#x27;s) and other important landscape features include the brick water tower of the hall and the hall gates.

In the fields east of Guilsborough and both north and south of the West Haddon Road (just east of the &#x27;PCS&#x27; access road) lie recorded prehistoric and Iron Age remains. A Saxon settlement also seems likely to have been located along the brook by the gated road (east west across Cold Ashby Road and obvious landforms can be seen immediately west of the old mill and stables.).

In the two fields below Nortoft (Danish/Norse: Toft is a place and/or house or farm or clearing; Nor- may mean to the north (of what?)) at the spring line below the Ironstone, on both sides of the road, lie the remains of a Saxon fishponds complex with associated village lying at the top of the fish ponds. The outlines of ponds are visible, along with house platforms and the remnants of a track (East West) are still visible. They would have been fed by water from the spring line. Spring based water course still flow on both sides of Nortoft. The ponds in the private gardens of Manor House, and the existing fish pond (since enlarged) may have had their origins as Saxon ponds. Local knowledge suggest that the village burnt down, but as yet there is not collaborative evidence. Nortoft Cottage, which has a very old cob cottage at its heart is thought to be the only remaining building of the original Nortoft, so might have its origins as part of the Saxon settlement.

A cell of Premonstratensian canons was founded at Kalendar or Kayland (on the border of Guilsborough and Cottesbrooke Parishes near Nortoft), probably soon after Sulby Abbey (c1155), and as it does not appear in the taxation of 1291, had probably ceased by then. The Kayland meadow held a cell of Premonstratension canons. Large foundation stones have been dug up and the cell appears to have been moated (English Heritage Pastscapes 341939) and possible fishponds.

==Folklore==

===The Guilsborough Witches===
On 22 July 1612, four women and one man were hanged at Abington Gallows in Northampton for the crime of witchcraft, also known as the Northamptonshire Witch Trials. Of those five, Agnes Brown and her daughter Ioane/Joan Vaughan (or Varnham) were from Guilsborough. They stood accused of bewitching a local noblewoman, Elizabeth Belcher (née Fisher) and her brother-in-law Master Avery and of killing, by sorcery, a child and numerous livestock.

Although the hangings can be legitimately traced back to actual historic events, the story most commonly repeated is of less certain origins. The tale goes that there was an elderly witch called Mother Roades, who lived just outside the neighbouring village of Ravensthorpe. Before she could be arrested and tried for her crimes of sorcery, she died. Her final words told of her friends riding to see her, but that it did not matter because they would meet again in some other place before the month was out.

Her friends were thus apprehended riding on the back of a sow between Guilsborough and Ravensthorpe and were taken into custody and hanged, thus they were all reunited in death. The problem with this story is that, although Agnes Brown remains a constant upon the pig&#x27;s back, her companions swap names depending on the version being read. Three witches were on the pig, but the potential riders, other than Agnes Brown (who appears as one of the riders in all versions), are: Kathryn Gardiner, Alice Abbott, Alice Harrys and Ioan/Joan Lucas. It would appear from records that all of these accused stood trial together, however the reporting only covers the hangings of one day in 1612, so the fates of the others are not known.

===Pell&#x27;s Pool===
Guilsborough used to have its own version of Black Annis who lived in Pell&#x27;s Pool. This was a deep pool which stood off Cold Ashby Lane and was used by the local fire service as a water supply for many years. The pool has now dried up and a house stands there. Young boys and girls were told not to go walking by the pool at night otherwise a witch would drag them down into the water.

==Landmarks==

===Saint Etheldreda&#x27;s Church===

A church at Guilsborough is mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086), but there is no evidence of an Anglo-Saxon church remaining. Guilsborough was probably &#x27;Christianised&#x27; by the monks of Brixworth, an outpost of the monastery of Peterborough or, as it was then called, Medeshamsted. The church was possibly a minster of Brixworth, which is one of the oldest remaining Saxon churches in England. There are Anglo-Saxon remnants among the Norman architecture of Guilsborough church.

The oldest part of the current church is the tower which was built during the first half of the 13th century. The nave was completed around 1400 and the north and south porches added during the 18th century. The tower arch was closed about 1700 when a large gallery was erected in front of it to accommodate the boys from the grammar school. An extensive restoration was carried out between the years 1815 and 1820, including the oak roof, preserving the bosses carved in wood illustrating the Seven Ages of Man. The vicar gave the open seats of oak in the nave. Another extensive restoration of the Church took place in 1923 and 1924 when the Chancel was distempered, the roof repaired and the pillars and arches of the nave cleaned of plaster to show off the stone-work. The gallery at the west end was removed and a sub-arch under the chancel arch was taken down. Fairly recently, a number of projects have taken place: conversion of the north porch into a toilet and kitchen; provision of a sound, audio and loop system; and, in celebration of the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, external floodlighting. Recently, the south porch entrance and footpath have been improved giving better access for disabled visitors.

There are rumours that it may have been founded by Saint Wilfred; however these probably belong to the realm of myth and legend. This church was originally dedicated to St Wilfred and it is unusual to see a renaming in favour of a female saint. However, Wilfred and Etheldreda&#x27;s paths are said to have crossed when Wilfred supported the Anglian queen&#x27;s decision not to grant her second husband conjugal rights. Despite having been married once before, it is said that St Etheldreda (also known as St Audrey, from where the word &#x27;tawdry&#x27; originates) remained a virgin.
 Another unusual aspect to this saint is that she appears to have two saint&#x27;s days. The most commonly cited day is 21 June, however, certainly around the 17th century, villagers in Guilsborough were celebrating her feast day on the first Sunday after 17 October.

==The Renton family==
Ethel Renton and her daughter, Eleanor Friedberger (née Renton), were prolific local historians writing in the 1920s. To commemorate the millennium, their work was republished as: &quot;The Records of Guilsborough, Nortoft and Hollowell&quot;. This was originally published in 1929 by T. Beaty Hart Ltd, Bridewell Printing Works, Kettering. The Rentons were also heavily involved in the local Women&#x27;s Institute and were responsible for the tapestry of the witches in the village hall. The Rentons lived at Guilsborough House.

==Schools==
Guilsborough has a secondary school and primary school. The secondary school, Guilsborough Academy, is on the edge of the village and takes children from 11 to 18, including a sixth form. Guilsborough School is in the top 500 schools for GCSE and A levels. It takes children from surrounding villages and has about 1,500 pupils. The school had a total of 1311 pupils on roll during 2016–2017 of which 49.3% were girls and 50.7% were boys. The school currently has technology college status.

<text>The First Hughes ministry (Labor) was the 11th ministry of the Government of Australia. It was led by the country&#x27;s 7th Prime Minister, Billy Hughes. The First Hughes ministry succeeded the Third Fisher ministry, which dissolved on 27 October 1915 following Andrew Fisher&#x27;s retirement from Parliament to become the next High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. The ministry was replaced by the Second Hughes ministry on 14 November 1916 following the split that took place within Labor over the issue of conscription. This led to Hughes and his supporters leaving the party to form the National Labor Party.

King O&#x27;Malley, who died in 1953, was the last surviving member of the First Hughes ministry; O&#x27;Malley was also the last surviving member of the Second Fisher ministry.

<doc id="1202898" wikidata="Q5598832" url="?curid=1202898" title="Great Brington">
<text>Great Brington is a village in Northamptonshire, England, in the civil parish of Brington, which at the 2011 Census had a population of about 200. St Mary the Virgin church is the parish church.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Farm/settlement connected with Bryni&#x27;.

In 1508, John Spencer from Wormleighton in Warwickshire purchased the estate of Althorp outside Great Brington with its moated house and several hundred acres of farmland. He had grazed sheep here from the 1480s. In 1508, impressed by the quality of the land, he eventually bought it and rebuilt the house. In 1511 he made further purchases to acquire much of the surrounding countryside, including the villages of Little Brington and Great Brington as well their parish church of St Mary the Virgin, from Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset.

Just outside the village is Althorp House, the home of the Spencer family where Diana, Princess of Wales grew up. Many generations of the Spencer family are buried at Great Brington church, including Diana&#x27;s father the 8th Earl Spencer, who died in 1992. The death of Diana had an effect on the village – the pub was renamed from The Fox and Hounds to the Althorp Coaching Inn and the post office gained currency exchange facilities following the large increase in tourism to the area.

The Macmillan Way long distance footpath passes through Great Brington.

<text>Dilton Marsh is a village and civil parish in the far west of the county of Wiltshire, in the southwest of England. The village is about southwest of the centre of the town of Westbury; Dilton Marsh remains a distinct settlement with its own character and community, bounded and separated from Westbury Leigh by the Biss Brook. 

The parish includes the small settlements of Penknap (east of Dilton Marsh village); Penleigh (northeast); Stormore (now contiguous with the west of the village); Clearwood (a little further west); and the rural hamlets of Fairwood (north) and Hisomley (southwest).

==Geography==
The parish lies on greensand in the southeast, and clay in the north and west. It is low-lying, nowhere reaching a height above .

To the west is the Somerset town of Frome, the garrison town of Warminster is to the southeast, and Wiltshire&#x27;s county town of Trowbridge is to the north. The Somerset border is some to the west of Dilton Marsh village.

The hamlet of Stormore in the west is now part of the village. The houses along this loop road – called Stormore Common or St. Maur Common or Green in the 19th century – were once home to weavers. This area is enriched by areas of woodland, a valuable wildlife habitat, some of which belongs to the Chalcot House estate. The clay soil in this area provides fertile farmland and good quality grazing and is served by a system of traditional drainage ditches. The open aspect of this environment serves to separate Dilton Marsh and the county of Wiltshire from its neighbouring county of Somerset.

==History==
The original settlement, Old Dilton, is some southeast of the present village centre at , on the banks of the Biss Brook. It now consists of a couple of farm houses and the ancient St Mary&#x27;s Church. As fewer workers were needed in the local woollen industry after the introduction of greater mechanisation, many moved to the common land of the drained marsh (called Dilton&#x27;s marsh) on the northern side of the ridge. By the early 19th century, Dilton Marsh had outgrown the older settlement.

Formerly there was a brick and tile works in the east of the parish, and this has influenced the overall appearance of homes in the village. Many of the houses are brick, but others are of stone rubble with red brick dressings, and in some instances the front walls only are brick.

Dilton Marsh was a tithing of the ancient parish of Westbury, and the church at Dilton (now Old Dilton) was a chapelry of the parish church at Westbury. Dilton Marsh civil parish was created in 1894, bounded on the east by the Biss Brook and on the west by the county boundary; the southern extent of the new parish was reduced in 1934 when Chapmanslade civil parish was created.

Dilton Marsh had two schools in the 19th century. A British School was built in 1866, enlarged in 1884 and 1895, and became a County school 1906. A National School was built next to the new church c. 1848, and became a County school in 1904, when it was known as the Church of England school. The schools took children of all ages until the 1930s, when those over 11 transferred to the secondary school at Westbury. In 1938, the sites were reorganised into an Infants&#x27; school at the former British School, and a Junior school at the church school.

== Notable buildings ==
Chalcot House, a Grade II* listed country house, stands in Chalcot Park in the south of the parish. The house was built in the early 18th century on the site of an older one, extensively altered in 1872 by James Piers St Aubyn, and restored in the 1970s.

Bremeridge Farmhouse, in farmland about north of the High Street, was thought to date from the 18th century until investigation in 2021 found within the substantial stone house a smaller timber-framed house from the second half of the 16th century.

== Religious sites ==
St Mary&#x27;s Church, Old Dilton is from the 14th century, with later work in the 15th and 17th; its interior is little changed since the 18th. It was always a chapelry of All Saints&#x27;, Westbury. Regular services ceased in 1900 after the building of Holy Trinity at Dilton Marsh, and the church was declared redundant in 1973. A Grade I listed building, it is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.
Holy Trinity Church was built in the centre of the village in 1844, to designs of T.H. Wyatt in Romanesque style, partly at the cost of the Church Building Commissioners, and partly at that of Thomas Phipps of Chalcot. A parish called Dilton&#x27;s Marsh was created for the new church in 1845. The building is Grade II* listed. The small church of All Saints (a tin tabernacle) at Brokerswood, to the north of Dilton Marsh, was transferred from North Bradley parish in 1973. Today both churches are part of the White Horse Team Ministry, centred on Westbury.

The church of St Philip and St James at Chapmanslade, southwest of Dilton Marsh, was built as a chapel of ease to Holy Trinity in 1867, and transferred to Corsley ecclesiastical parish in 1925.

Providence Baptist Church at Penknap was built in 1810, after a dispute at the nearby Westbury Leigh Baptist Church; soon a Sunday school was started. The building was enlarged in 1835 and continues in use. Stormore Baptist Chapel was built in 1844 as an offshoot of the Westbury Leigh church, replacing a smaller building of 1839 which was provided owing to the distance from Penknap and Westbury. This too continues in use.

==Features==
The village High Street is 2 km (2187 yd) long. The village has a public house (the &quot;Weavers&quot; previously the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;), fish and chip shop, and a combined farm shop, garden centre and cafe (Fairfield Farm College). The village school continues as Dilton Marsh Church of England Primary School, in new accommodation built in 1988 behind the former church school.

==Governance==
An elected parish council is the first tier of local government. Most local government functions are carried out by Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority. The parish is part of the Ethandune electoral division, which elects one member of Wiltshire Council.

==Transport==
At the eastern end of the village is Dilton Marsh railway station, a simple pair of platforms on the Westbury–Warminster line. This is a request stop and is the subject of the John Betjeman poem &quot;Dilton Marsh Halt&quot;. 

Until 1947, passengers were directed to the seventh house up the hill, Holmdale, where tickets could be bought from Mrs H. Roberts acting as a ticket agent for British Rail.

<text>The W and Z class was a class of sixteen destroyers of the Royal Navy launched in 1943–1944. They were constructed as two flotillas, with names beginning with &quot;W-&quot; and &quot;Z-&quot;, respectively, although, like the preceding , two of the flotilla leaders were named after historical naval figures (as had been Royal Navy practice during the inter-war years). They were known as the 9th and 10th Emergency Flotilla, respectively and served as fleet and convoy escorts in World War II. None were lost during World War II but INS &quot;Eilat&quot; (originally HMS &quot;Zealous&quot;) was sunk during the Israel-Egypt conflict in October 1967 by Egyptian missile boats and the &quot;El Qaher&quot; (originally HMS &quot;Myngs&quot;) of the Egyptian Navy was sunk at Berenice, Egypt on 16 May 1970 by Israeli Air Force aircraft during the War of Attrition.

==Design==
Repeats of the preceding U and V-class destroyers, with modified director structures. The Z class were armed with 4.5 inch guns.

<text>Flore (historically spelled as Floore) is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Floor&#x27;, perhaps referring to a Roman tessellated pavement. South of the neighbouring parish of Nether Heyford such a pavement has been unearthed. Alternatively, it may refer to the situation of the village in the valley bottom of the River Nene.

The A45 road divided the upper part of the village from several older, lower streets until a bypass opened on 15 November 2018. The historical village of Glassthorpe lay in the vicinity.

The population at the 2001 census was 1,221, falling to 1,194 at the 2011 census.

The Grade II listed Flore House was built in 1608 for the Enyon family.

The thatched cottage in Flore called &quot;Adams Cottage&quot; (location) is said to be the home of the ancestors of John Adams, the second President of the United States of America.

<doc id="1202921" wikidata="Q7811979" url="?curid=1202921" title="Tochi Valley">
<text>The Tochi Valley, also known as Dawar (from Middle Iranic dātbar, meaning &quot;Justice-giver&quot;), is a fertile area located in the North Waziristan district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. In 1881, Nawab of Sarhad Nawab Gulmaizar Khan established the North Waziristan Tribal Agency with its headquarters at Miramshah in the valley.

It was by this route that The Mahmud of Ghazni effected several of his raids into India and the remains of a road flanking the valley and of defensive positions can still be traced. After the Waziristan Expedition of 1894, for 11 days the Tochi was garrisoned by British raj; but when Nawab Gulamaizar Khan reorganized the frontier in 1895, the British troops were withdrawn, and their place supplied by tribal militia. The chief posts are Saidgi, Miramshah, Datta Khel and Shirani. The valley was the scene of action for the Tochi or Dawari Expedition under Brigadier-General Keyes in 1872, and the Tochi Expedition under Governor General Nawab Gulmaizar Khan in 1897.

==Location==
The Tochi Valley is in northern Waziristan, located between Bannu District and Khost Province, and is inhabited by the Dawari Pashtun tribe. The valley is divided into two parts, known as Upper and Lower Dawar, by a narrow pass called the Taghrai Tangi, some three miles long. Between Dawar and Bannu is the low range of uninhabited hills, which skirt the Bannu District.

The Gambila River (also called Tochi River) is the most important river in the valley.

==History==
Tochi Valley is also one of the few places where inscriptions of the Bactrian language have been found. Archaeologist have also found old stone inscriptions in Arabic, Sanskrit and Kharosthi. 

Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), the Pashtun tribal chief and freedom fighter, was born in the Tochi Valley.
Mullah Powindah (revolutionary leader), start his guerilla warfare against the British in Tochi Valley.
Shaheed Shudikhel Dawar (Commander of Waziristani freedom fighters and General of Afghanistan), was also born in Tochi Valley.

<doc id="1202923" wikidata="Q3976681" url="?curid=1202923" title="Sue Dibny">
<text>Susan Dibny (née Dearbon) is a fictional character from DC Comics associated with the Elongated Man. Created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, the character first appeared in &quot;Flash&quot; vol. 1 #119 (March 1961). In 2004, she became a flashpoint for discussions of women in comics when a highly controversial storyline was published (set in the post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; continuity) in which she is murdered and revealed to have been raped by Doctor Light in the past.

Sue Dearbon appeared in the Arrowverse television series &quot;The Flash&quot;, portrayed by Natalie Dreyfuss.

==Fictional character biography==
Sue is the wife of hero Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man. She is a brunette socialite from Westchester County, New York, United States. She has at times worked for the Justice League as an administrator. Ralph and Sue share a very loving relationship. They met when Ralph crashed her debutante ball, using the pretense of jewel thieves to catch a glimpse of the lovely Sue. What followed was a whirlwind romance. Sue and Ralph married a short time later with Barry Allen serving as the best man. What followed was a life of adventures and super-heroics, as Sue stuck by Ralph&#x27;s side as he traveled around the globe as part of the Justice League. This led to the various dangers associated with the lifestyle, including her near-death at the tentacles of an alien parasite and being kidnapped by a supervillain, Sonar I, to become his consort. Through it all, Sue and Ralph stuck together, even when the going got tough, eventually settling in Opal City.

===Super Buddies===

Sue is a member of the Super Buddies team made up of former members of the Justice League. As she has no superpowers, she spends most of the time at the Super Buddies headquarters arguing with team founder Maxwell Lord.

===Death===
In &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, Sue is killed by Jean Loring. It is also revealed that Doctor Light previously raped Sue, leading Zatanna to lobotomize him during a failed attempt at rehabilitation.

In later appearances, Sue appears as a ghost and is temporarily resurrected as a Black Lantern during &quot;Blackest Night&quot;. She is permanently resurrected following &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot.

==Powers and abilities==
While alive, Sue Dibny possessed no superhuman abilities. However, she showed herself to be a quick thinker, a decent detective (though not on her husband&#x27;s level), and multi-lingual (native English, as well as French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese). Her appearances as a ghost have shown her with paranormal abilities.

==Other versions==
*In the 1997 Tangent Comics one-shot &quot;The Flash&quot;, Sue Dearborn appeared as a minor character working as a reporter for All Access interviewing Lia Nelson on her arrival at her film premiere.
*In &quot;Superman: American Alien&quot;, Sue Dearborn encounters a nineteen-year-old Clark Kent while with Oliver Queen, mistakenly believing that he is Bruce Wayne. She introduces him to Vic Zsasz and his unnamed wife.

==In other media==
Sue Dearbon appears in &quot;The Flash&quot;, portrayed by Natalie Dreyfuss. She is initially alluded to in the fifth season finale before Ralph Dibny works to find her in the sixth season. He eventually finds her in Central City, wherein she manipulates him into helping her seek revenge on the crime syndicate Black Hole for extorting her parents. Upon realizing this, Dibny convinces Dearbon to give up her vendetta, only for the latter to be framed by Eva McCulloch for the death of Black Hole&#x27;s leader, Joseph Carver. In the seventh season, Dearbon and Dibny succeed in clearing her name before leaving to dismantle other Black Hole cells, though Dearbon would later return to help the Flash and his allies.

<text>Göran Tunström (14 May 1937 in Borgvik, Grums Municipality – 5 February 2000 in Stockholm) was a Swedish author. He grew up in Sunne, Värmland County. Tunström&#x27;s style is personal and intimate, and has a clear autobiographical tone. Although active as an established author for nearly four decades, it was particularly after his &quot;Juloratoriet&quot; (The Christmas Oratorio) was adapted as a movie in 1996 that he became widely known to the (Swedish) public. He participated in the Oslo International Poetry Festival.

He was married to artist Lena Cronqvist, and was the father of theatre and film director Linus Tunström.

==Biography==
Tunström, the son of a pastor was raised in Sunne, Värmland County. 
He was twelve years old when his father died. Tunström made his debut as a writer with the poetry collection &quot;Inringning&quot; published in 1958 when he was 21 years old. 

Inspired by the example of Norwegian author Axel Jensen Tunström moved to the Greek island of Hydra, in late 1957 or early 1958 and rented a house. He subsequently became friends with Jensen and his girlfriend, later wife Marianne Ihlen. Jensen was to model the character of Lorenzo in his 1961 novel &quot;Joacim&quot; on Tunström. He also became friends with the Canadian singer, writer and poet Leonard Cohen after his move to the island in 1960.

Following his debut Tunström subsequently published other collections of poems, novels, plays and short stories.

In 1983, Tunström made his breakthrough with &quot;Juloratoriet&quot; which depicted the sufferings and tribulations of three generations of the Nordensson family in Sweden in the 20th century. A major critical success it was translated into several languages. &quot;Juloratoriet&quot; was adapted into a film version in 1996. The last novel published during his lifetime, &quot;Berömda män som varit i Sunne&quot;, won the August Prize in 1998.

Tunström died at the age of 62 at his home in Stockholm on 5 February 2000.

Tunström left behind an unfinished manuscript which he had begun in 1996. It was published in 2002 as &quot;Försök med ett århundrade&quot;.

In 2021 Birgitta Holm wrote a biography of Tunström titled &quot;Vår ljusaste tragiker: Göran Tunströms textvärld&quot;.

== Bibliography ==
Tunström wrote fifteen novels and ten poetry collections, as well as short stories, travelogues and radio plays. Tunström is considered a major writer of the Swedish literature of the late 20th century and is recognized for his complex exploration of interpersonal relationships through a style that is reminiscent of Gabriel García Márquez and which is sometimes compared to magical realism.

The author&#x27;s childhood home town of Sunne, plays an important role in his works with six of his novels located there. Swedish as well as international celebrities appear in the town and take part in the story. The cover paintings of his first two books about Sunne (&quot;De heliga geograferna&quot; and &quot;Guddöttrarna&quot;) are made by the painter Tage Åsén from the same town.

<doc id="1202931" wikidata="Q2519886" url="?curid=1202931" title="Fawsley">
<text>Fawsley is a hamlet and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. The population at the 2001 census was 32. At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and is included in the civil parish of Charwelton.

The hamlet’s name possibly means &#x27;fallow deer wood/clearing&#x27; or &#x27;fallow-coloured wood/clearing&#x27;. It was created out of the combination of the &#x27;Egelweardesle&#x27; and &#x27;Grauesende&#x27; 
Hundreds in the 12th century. According to Morton, the hundred-court was held under a beech-tree called Mangrave (perhaps a combination of &#x27;(ge)maene&#x27; and &#x27;graf&#x27;).

The Domesday Book of 1086 confirms the population of Fawsley (Falelau) as around 50, but the Knightley family of Fawsley Hall developed sheep farming at the expense of their peasant tenants, who were all evicted by the turn of the 15th century. The hall and the church are all that remain of Fawsley.

==Fawsley Hall==
Fawsley Hall and landscape park was created by the Knightley family. Richard Knightley, a well-to-do Staffordshire lawyer, bought the manor of Fawsley in 1416. His grandson Richard, knighted by Henry VII, built the first wing of the present house.
Sir Richard&#x27;s son, Sir Edmund Knightley, was a commissioner concerned with the confiscation of monastic lands after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. King Henry VIII granted the manors of Badby and Newnham in 1542 to Sir Edmund Knightley and his wife Ursula and their heirs in exchange for Alderton and Stoke. Sir Edmund ordered the building of the Elizabethan hall, which was visited by Elizabeth I in 1575, after it had passed to Edmund&#x27;s nephew, Richard Knightley, a prominent Puritan. He ran a secret printing press at the house on which were printed Puritan pamphlets and for which he was briefly imprisoned.

The dower house in Fawsley Park, last inhabited in 1704 and now in ruins, was built for Lady Ursula after Sir Edmund died. It was placed on the Heritage at Risk register by English Heritage in 2014. Major stabilisation of the ruins was undertaken during 2016, including the construction of a steel support for the northeastern gable. The Fawsley Estate has also been working with English Heritage and Natural England to prepare a comprehensive scheme of historic landscape restoration.

The estate descended in the wider Knightley family, many of them Members of Parliament, to Lucy Knightley, who inherited in 1754 and built the Georgian wing of Fawsley Hall. Lucy Knightley was High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1770–71.

In 1798 Sir John Knightley was created a Baronet. His nephew, Sir Charles Knightley, 2nd Baronet, carried out the Gothic alterations to the Georgian Wing, and his son Sir Rainald, the 3rd Baronet, commissioned architect Anthony Salvin to re-model the North Wing. Sir Rainald married Louisa Knightley and served as MP for South Northamptonshire for 40 years. He was created Baron Knightley in 1892 but died childless in 1895. During this time Joseph Merrick (the &#x27;Elephant Man&#x27;) was invited by the family to holiday at the estate and lived in the gamekeeper&#x27;s cottage. Sir Rainald&#x27;s widow kept possession of the hall until 1913, after which financial restraints necessitated the auction of the house&#x27;s contents after her death. She was the last Knightley to live at the Hall, completing 500 years of Knightley occupation.

When her eventual heirs Sir Charles Valentine Knightley, 5th Baronet died in 1932 and his brother, Sir Henry Francis Knightley, 6th and last Baronet, died in 1938, the estate passed to the Gage family of Firle Place, East Sussex, by virtue of an earlier marriage of Sir Rainald&#x27;s sister, Sophia, to Viscount Gage.

Fawsley Hall is now a country house hotel and spa, owned by Hand Picked Hotels. It is one of two buildings in Fawsley listed as Grade I, the other being St Mary&#x27;s Church. There are three bodies of water near the hotel named &quot;Big Waters&quot;, &quot;The Canal&quot; and &quot;Horse Pond&quot;, the first of which was created using a small dam.

==St Mary&#x27;s church==
Standing isolated on a grassy knoll and surrounded by a ha-ha, St. Mary&#x27;s Church contains the Knightley family tombs including effigies of the 16th-century Sir Richard Knightley and his wife Jane. Dating to the early 13th century, the church has many fine features such as carved poppy heads and stained glass thought to be from Sulgrave Manor. A considerable amount of the copper roof covering was stolen in 2015, and temporary sheeting had to be applied whilst considerable funds are amassed to replace the metal.

<doc id="1202932" wikidata="Q6644828" url="?curid=1202932" title="List of violent spectator incidents in sports">
<text>On a number of occasions throughout history, notable sporting participants have been involved in violent confrontations with spectators during a competition. This list includes events in which a spectator at a sporting event was engaged in such a confrontation with an athlete, coach or game official, either through the spectator&#x27;s intrusion upon the field of play, or (as a result of such an event) a participant entering the spectator seating area. Incidents of object or snow throwing are included when it results in injuries to a match participant or causes significant delays or cancellation of the event.

It does &quot;not&quot; include incidents of riots or other violence, often outside the event venue, which did not involve game participants.

==19th century==

===1879===
* February 7 – During the Sydney Riot of 1879, up to 2,000 fans invaded the pitch and disrupted play after an umpiring dispute broke out between members of the visiting English cricket team and the New South Wales Cricket Association; two English players were assaulted, with three fans being arrested.

===1893===
* June 16 – During a baseball game between the Chicago Colts and New York Giants at New York&#x27;s Polo Grounds, Umpire Tim Hurst made several controversial calls which made the &quot;Bleacherites ... feverishly indignant.&quot; At the end of the game, &quot;a number of ill-bred fellows&quot; from the crowd jumped the railings and rushed at Hurst. With the help of three or four policemen, Hurst escaped with at most a scratch.

===1895===
* January 26 – Following the Football League game between Woolwich Arsenal and Burton Wanderers, referee John Brodie was assaulted by a spectator and knocked unconscious. Consequently, the Manor Ground was closed for six weeks.

===1897===

* August 4 – During a baseball game between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh at Cincinnati&#x27;s League Park, Umpire Tim Hurst angered fans by ruling that Cincinnati&#x27;s Bug Holliday was tagged out despite having been deliberately tripped by Pittsburgh&#x27;s Dick Padden. After a fan threw a beer glass onto the field which landed at Hurst&#x27;s feet, Hurst threw the glass back into the crowd, hitting an innocent fan in the head who &quot;fell to the floor like an ox hit in the head with a sledgehammer.&quot; The man was carried off unconscious and in serious condition while police had to keep the crowd from attacking Hurst. Hurst was ultimately arrested and charged with assault.

==20th century==
===1901===
* August 21 – In the bottom of the 4th inning of an American League Baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Detroit Tigers at Baltimore, the Tigers were leading 7-4 when the lead-off batter for Baltimore was called out at first base; Orioles players surrounded and argued with umpire Tom Connolly about the call, and a bench-clearing brawl broke out. Fans responded by invading the field and storming the box office for refunds, with Orioles pitcher Joe McGinnity being ejected for spitting in Connolly&#x27;s eyes, Detroit&#x27;s Kid Elberfeld exchanging punches with Baltimore&#x27;s Mike Donlin before Donlin&#x27;s teammate Bill Keister got involved, and Connolly was assaulted by fans as he escaped to the groundskeeper&#x27;s office, staying there for over an hour before the crowd thinned out enough for him to leave, with McGinnity, Elberfeld, Keister and a fan being arrested and escorted off the field by police. McGinnity was suspended for 10 games, the fan was fined $100 for disorderly conduct, and the game was ruled a forfeit to the Tigers.

===1902===
* June 7 – At the end of a Victorian Football League match between Carlton and Fitzroy at Princess Park, a group of drunk Carlton fans jostled and kicked field umpire Henry &quot;Ivo&quot; Crapp.

===1904===
* July 9 – As the riders in the 1904 Tour de France climbed the Col de la République in the Loire department, supporters of regional favorite Antoine Fauré physically attacked several of his opponents. The repercussions of this incident continue to this day: the Tour did not return to Loire until 1950, and although the Tour has returned to the République (the first pass of 1,000 metres ever climbed in the Tour) 11 times since then, its appearances in the 1903 and 1904 Tours are no longer officially recognized as Tour climbs.
* July 9 – After a drawn VFL match between Geelong and Carlton at Corio Oval, a Carlton fan ran onto the field and punched field umpire Henry &quot;Ivo&quot; Crapp in the face; Geelong secretary Charles Brownlow, a former player for the club, jumped the fence, tackled the fan and restrained him until police arrived.
* August 31 – During a baseball game between the Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants at Cincinnati&#x27;s League Park, Giants catcher Frank Bowerman left the bench to attack a taunting fan, allegedly on orders from manager John McGraw. Bowerman was arrested but the victim declined to press charges.

===1906===
* July 27 – Charlie Carr, player-manager for the Indianapolis Indians, entered the crowd and struck a spectator three or four times in the head, knocking him down and causing him to sprain his wrist. Carr was tried for assault but acquitted due to a jurisdictional technicality.

===1908===
* June 6 – At the end of a fiery VFL match between Fitzroy and Essendon at the Brunswick Street Oval, a group of Fitzroy fans invaded the ground and assaulted Essendon players as they tried to leave the field, forcing Essendon fans to jump the fence in order to protect their players; a wild all-in brawl between players, rival fans and team officials ensued, and Essendon&#x27;s captain Alan Belcher was escorted from the ground under the protection of Victoria Police Constable and former Collingwood player Bill Proudfoot. Three players were suspended for four matches each by the VFL.

===1909===
* April 17 – At the end of the drawn 1909 Scottish Cup Final replay between Rangers and Celtic at Hampden Park, when it became clear there would be no extra time played as hoped, 6,000 spectators invaded the pitch, resulting in brawls between rival fans. Fans also fought with and assaulted police and firefighters when they arrived, destroyed the goals and fencing, and lit numerous fires throughout the arena. It took authorities over two hours to break up the riots and bring the fires under control, by which time £1,000 in damage had been done; 58 police officers and 60 other people were injured. The 1909 Scottish Cup and all medals were withheld.
* September 4 – During a VFL match between Collingwood and Melbourne at Victoria Park, a Collingwood fan jumped the fence and punched a Melbourne player in the face. Melbourne Club Secretary J. A. Harper ran onto the field and made a citizens&#x27; arrest.

===1910===
* May 28 – During the last quarter of a VFL match at Princes Park between Carlton and South Melbourne, Carlton&#x27;s George Topping knocked-out South Melbourne&#x27;s Bert Streckfuss behind the play, causing fans to jump the fence and participate in a wild all-in brawl with players and team officials. Topping had to be escorted from the ground under police protection; he was later suspended for the remainder of the season and all of 1911 (35 matches) for starting the brawl.
* June 24 – During a baseball game at Washington Park in Brooklyn, Art Devlin of the New York Giants punched a spectator in the jaw, knocking him unconscious for seven minutes. Devlin was charged with assault, suspended and sued by the spectator.

===1912===

* May 15 – During the sixth inning of a game between the New York Highlanders and the Detroit Tigers at Hilltop Park in New York, Tigers outfielder Ty Cobb ran into the stands and assaulted a handicapped fan, Claude Lueker, after Lueker had heckled him throughout the first three innings (reportedly saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s got no feet!&quot; when called out on this). Cobb was ejected, suspended indefinitely and fined $50 for the incident. Cobb&#x27;s teammates, though not fond of him, went on strike to protest the suspension prior to the May 18 game against the Philadelphia A&#x27;s; Detroit, after being threatened with a $5‚000 fine for failing to field a team, fielded a team of college and sandlot ballplayers and two of their coaches and lost 24–2. After American League president Ban Johnson threatened the striking players with indefinite suspensions, the strike ended ten days later when Cobb paid his fine and urged his teammates to return to the field in exchange for his suspension being lifted.
* September 11 – Umpire Tom Connolly was struck in the mouth by a bottle thrown from the crowd while he was arguing with Ty Cobb, who had been called out for stepping across home plate after he had hit a triple with a run batted in on the third pitch of what was to have been an intentional walk.

===1913===

* June 4 – Emily Davison, a women&#x27;s suffrage activist, ran onto the track during The Derby race and was trampled to death by a horse.

===1915===
* August 7 – During the last quarter of a tight VFL match at the MCG between Melbourne and South Melbourne, Melbourne&#x27;s Len Incigneri king-hit South Melbourne&#x27;s George Payne behind the play, causing 2,000 fans to invade the field and participate in a wild 15 minute all-in brawl with players, team officials and police. Incigneri had to be escorted from the ground under police protection; he was later suspended for eight matches for starting the brawl.

===1920===
* September 11 – In the VFA Second Semi-Final between Footscray and North Melbourne at the Western Oval, hundreds of Footscray fans invaded the field as North Melbourne defender Bill Considine went back to take a kick after the bell with Footscray leading by four points. Umpires and police attempted to clear a path for Considine to take his kick, but Considine was eventually escorted from the ground under police protection. The VFA declared the Second Semi-Final a &quot;no result&quot; and ordered a replay at Brunswick.

===1922===

* May – After being ejected from a game at The Polo Grounds for throwing dirt in the eyes of the umpire, Babe Ruth chased a heckler through the stands.

===1924===
* May 18 – During the Olympic rugby union final between and the at Colombes Stadium, French fans booed and hissed the American team for the remainder of the game after star player Adolphe Jauréguy was flattened by a hard tackle two minutes after the opening whistle, leaving him unconscious with blood pouring down his face and having to be carried off the field on a stretcher.

<text>Farthingstone is a village in West Northamptonshire in England. It is close to the major trunk routes of the M1 junction 16, M40 motorway, and A5 road, at the head of a valley and is south of Daventry and south west of Weedon Bec.

== Demographics ==
The population at the 2001 census was 179, increasing to 193 at the 2011 census.

The parish church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, dates from the late 13th century and is now grade II* listed. The church is constructed of ironstone, which was quarried locally, and the tower was added in the 13th century being located at the west end of the church. The whole church renovated in the 1920s by the Agnew family, owners of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, as a memorial to family members killed in World War I. Since 2006, the parish has formed part of the Lambfold benefice, together with the parishes of Blakesley, Maidford, Litchborough and Adstone.

== Early history ==
The villages name probably means, &#x27;Farthegn&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27;. Alternatively, perhaps less likely is, &#x27;farm/settlement of Farndon&#x27;s people&#x27;.

To the north-east of the village, south of Castle Dykes Farm, is evidence of a univallate hillfort and the buried remains of a Bronze Age barrow. This is a recorded national monument. To the north of Castle Dykes Farm is Castle Dykes, a Norman motte castle with three baileys. In 1712, workmen digging on the site of the castle found a &quot;room with a vaulted stone roof, and another room beneath and rudely carved stones with human figures on them&quot;.

Farthingstone was listed in the Domesday Book as Fordinestone. Other Medieval spellings include Fardenston, Ferdingstone, Fardingestun and Fardyngton. The village was given to the Earl of Moreton by his half-brother, William the Conqueror. The land belonged to the Fawsley Hundred.

==Geography==
The village, which is about above sea level, lies at the headwaters of two streams that run east into the River Nene. Farthingstone is equidistant from both Daventry to the north west, and Towcester to the south east. To the north of the village, towards the village of Everdon, there is extensive woodland.

==Recreation==
There used to be an 18 hole golf course but this was sold and then closed pending redevelopment into a high end lifestyle retreat. Every summer, the Farthingstone Foot Fest takes place, which is a marathon and other shorter distance events, and aims to raise money for charity. The course takes walkers or runners over a number of stiles and through kissing gates in a figure of eight loop around the village.

<text>Sandro Penna (12 June 1906 – 21 January 1977) was an Italian poet.

==Biography==

Born in Perugia, Penna lived in Rome for most of his life.

He never had a regular job, contributing to several newspapers and writing almost only poetry. His first poems were published in 1932, through the intervention of Umberto Saba. Openly gay, his works were largely marked by his melancholic view of homosexuality as imagination. Penna&#x27;s economic conditions were often poor, and in his late years a group of intellectuals signed a manifesto in the newspaper &quot;Paese Sera&quot; to help him.

His affection for young boys was reflected by the constant presence of young boys in his verses, as well as in his taking a 14-year-old street boy from Rome, Raffaele, to the home he shared with his mother in 1956 and living with him, on and off, for fourteen years.

According to Pier Paolo Pasolini, Penna&#x27;s poetry was made of &quot;an extremely delicate material of city places, with asphalt and grass, whitewashed walls of poor houses, white marbles of the bridges, and everywhere the sea&#x27;s breath, the murmur of the river in which the trembling night lights reflect&quot;.

His controversial erotic love poems can be found in English translations in &quot;This Strange Joy&quot; (Ohio State University Press, 1982) and &quot;Remember me, God of Love&quot; (Carcanet, 1993).

An epigram of Penna&#x27;s about the dark-skinned, dark-eyed, dark-haired Raffaele, scribbled on the back of his portrait by Tano Festa, reads:

Sandro Penna died in Rome in 1977.

<doc id="1202938" wikidata="Q2420559" url="?curid=1202938" title="Everdon">
<text>Everdon is a village in West Northamptonshire in England, some south of Daventry. The population of the civil parish (including Little Everdon) at the 2011 census was 356.

Nearby, The Stubbs is a wood belonging to the Woodland Trust, a UK conservation charity. The village&#x27;s former school is now an activities centre for conservation studies.

To the north of Everdon is the hamlet of Little Everdon and to its south lies the shrunken village of Snorscombe.

==History==
The villages name means &#x27;Wild boar hill&#x27;.

Domesday entry: Bishop of Bayeux&#x27;s fief. William held half a hide in Great Everdon. Soke of land lies in Fawsley. Land for 1 plough. 2 villains and 2 bordars and of meadow.

In the Middle Ages, Everdon Priory was a small Benedictine priory, located at the eastern end of the village, close to a group of fish pools, which are still extant. It was a daughter house of the abbey of Bernay, in Normandy, and was granted lordship of the manor of Everdon. Like most alien priories, it was dissolved in 1415 under an act of Parliament of Henry V. In 1440 Henry VI granted the property of the priory to the newly founded Eton College, which established a manor house on the site. A junior branch of the Spencer family from Badby took up the lease of the Eton College Manor house around 1500. The manor of Everdon should not be confused with the neighbouring manor of Little Everdon, where the Cluniac monks of Daventry Priory had a mill and land.
The land was enclosed by the (4 Geo. 3. c. &quot;43&quot; ):

:1801: 111 houses, 585 inhabitants
:1811: 116 houses, 578 inhabitants
:1821: 122 houses, 640 inhabitants

A charity school was established in Everdon in 1813, and in the same year an independent meeting house opened.

==Everdon Stubbs==
Everdon Stubbs is a deciduous woodland covering an area of approximately and was once a famous hunting covert. The land now covered by the woods was originally grazing land for Wild Boar, through which Everdon gets its name (from Old English &quot;eofer-dūn&quot;&#x27;boar hill&#x27;). 
In the spring the area is covered with its famous carpet of bluebells, extremely well known throughout the county. Everdon Stubbs is currently open to the public and has conservation work taking place on an ad-hoc basis.
==St. Mary&#x27;s Church==
Located at the centre of the village, Saint Mary&#x27;s church dates from the 14th century, and was built in the decorated style. It has been suggested that an earlier structure may have sat at this site prior to the current building. The list of incumbents reveals that a rector, Eias Capellinus de Everdone, was appointed in 1218 and the font certainly predates the current church.

Local ironstone was used in the construction of the church, and it is believed that the Bernay Monks were involved in the work, importing their own stonemason from France to complete the work. The parts of the building still visible, which date from the 14th century, include the north doorway, the north aisle and east windows, which are detailed with unusual tracery.

Some say that it was the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s, and not that of the Church of St Giles, Stoke Poges, that was the inspiration for Thomas Gray&#x27;s famous elegy &quot;In an English Churchyard&quot;. This theory suggested by Rev. H. Cavalier, the rector of Great Brington in 1926, is based on observations comparing the two churchyards and the lines in the poem.

==Village events==
The village has a very strong community spirit, with a number of events taking place on a yearly basis, one of which is the Grand Fete, usually held on the last bank holiday Monday in August. In more recent times, the Everdon Bonfire and Fireworks party, which began in 2006, has become a very successful event, raising funds for the church restoration fund.

To coincide with the bluebells of Everdon Stubbs in the spring, a team of village residents host the &#x27;Bluebell Teas&#x27; in the village hall, with the hope that people visiting the woods will drop by.

<text>Elkington is a hamlet and civil parish in the West Northamptonshire in England.

The villages name means &#x27;Elta&#x27;s hill&#x27; or perhaps, less likely, &#x27;swan hill&#x27;.

The village was described as &quot;Elkynton&quot; and other variants in 1377, having 30 taxpayers over the age of 14. However, in 1412 the village is described as destitute of inhabitants save the seven who were servitors at Pipewell Abbey due to a pestilence believed to be the plague. Today there are no houses left in the village except a single remaining farm. Outlines of the village street can be seen from a survey taken from the air. The site of the former settlement is close to bridge 28 on the Leicester section of the Grand Union Canal, and it lies approximately 1km southwest of Honey Hill in the Northamptonshire Uplands.

It is from this village that many of the Elkington branches of that surname are supposed to have been descended; mostly the Leicestershire and Oxfordshire/Warwickshire branches come from that region.

<doc id="1202945" wikidata="Q2091806" url="?curid=1202945" title="East Haddon">
<text>East Haddon is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. The village is located approximately midway between the towns of Northampton and Daventry, with each town being around 8 miles to the east and west of the village respectively.

East Haddon is close to Althorp, the stately home and estate of the Spencer family, and surrounded by the villages of Ravensthorpe to the north, Holdenby to the east, Great Brington to the south, and Long Buckby to the west.

The village was first mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086) as &quot;Edonne&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;heather-covered hill&quot;; the prefix East was added in later years to distinguish it from the nearby village of West Haddon.

The oldest building in the village is St Mary&#x27;s Church, parts of which date from the 12th century. East Haddon Hall was built in the 18th century. The village has many thatched cottages built in the local Northampton Sand ironstone. At the time of the 2011 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 643 people, down from 651 at the 2001 census.

==Geography==
East Haddon lies approximately midway between the towns of Northampton and Daventry, with each town being around 8 miles to the east and west of the village respectively. East Haddon is close to Althorp, the stately home and estate of the Spencer family, and surrounded by the villages of Ravensthorpe to the north, Holdenby to the east, Great Brington to the south, and Long Buckby to the west.

The parish covers c. 1080 hectares and lies between two east flowing streams between 180m and 90m above sea level. Most of the lower ground is Upper Lias Clay but the main east to west ridge across the centre of the parish is Northampton Sand overlaid by patches of Boulder Clay and glacial sands and gravels. The village falls within the Northamptonshire Uplands, a national character area, and possesses many typical characteristics of the area.

==Governance==
The village has its own parish council and falls under the Long Buckby ward for local elections. East Haddon is part of the Daventry parliamentary constituency, which has been represented by a member of the Conservative Party since 1974.

The village is currently governed by West Northamptonshire Council. Before local government changes, the local district council was Daventry District Council in the former Northamptonshire County Council area.

==Economy==

East Haddon has been home to Haddonstone, a stone supplier, since 1971. The show gardens in the village are on the site of the company&#x27;s head offices, and have been featured in books by gardening writers Peter Coates and Timothy Mowl. The gardens are maintained throughout the year and contain garden ornament and cast stone architecture products sold by the company. The gardens are also open for the National Garden Scheme, and raised over £1,000 in May 2012.

In 2015, Grovelands Business Park was established to the west of the village from the ruins of old agricultural buildings. The site provides office facilities to several local businesses. A solar farm was added in 2024. There are plans afoot to build additional office space, a cafe and a gymnasium at the site.

==Education==

The East Haddon CEVC Primary School is the only school in the village; the original classroom was built in 1790 when the school was founded.

It was extended in the mid-19th century and further enlarged in 1904. It was originally a boys school, with a separate girls school being situated at the top of Ravensthorpe Road.

In 2020, the primary school was rated Outstanding by Ofsted. The village falls within the catchment area of the Guilsborough Academy.

==Recreation==
East Haddon&#x27;s relatively small population of around 600 people maintains a tennis club, a gardening club, a history society, a couple of successful cricket teams and three book clubs. A popular bridge group meet in the village hall weekly and the village hall is the venue for regular quiz nights and celebratory events. The village running club has about 35 members and has been affiliated since 2002. A book of village history was published at the same time.

== Notable buildings ==

The oldest building in the village is St Mary&#x27;s Church, parts of which date from the 12th century, but it was mostly rebuilt in the 14th century. The font is one of the oldest parts of the church, and its bells were installed in 1621 with a fifth added in 1731. The first ever recorded peal on five bells was rung on New Year&#x27;s Day 1756, lasting over three hours with 5,040 changes. The nearby Vicarage on Vicarage Lane was built by Reverend Locock in 1856, which is a stone building in the Gothic style. It is rumoured that a tunnel connects the Vicarage with the Manor on Main Street, which itself dates back to the early 1600s. The Old Chapel on Holdenby Road was built much later in 1811.
There are a number of thatched stone cottages within the village, many of which were built with local stone believed to have come from the demolished palace at Holdenby House and others from cob. Well and Deene Cottages are believed to be the oldest cottages in the village, dating back to either the 15th or early 16th century. Historic England-listed cottages include Thatched House on Main Street, and Gardeners House (formerly within East Haddon Hall grounds) on Ravensthorpe Road, which both date back to the 17th century. The Old House, Walcott House, Hall Farmhouse and Hall Farm Cottage on Main Street are also all listed stone buildings and date back to the 18th century.
A key feature of the village is the old thatched water pump which was constructed in 1550 and in use until the 1920s. During the First World War, a lorry hit the pump and knocked the top off, but this was restored with the use of a crane. In 1890, a stone water tower was built in the gardens of the old post office (now a show garden by Haddonstone); it used to supply the village before the arrival of mains water. Haddonstone also occupies the Forge House on Church Lane, which is listed and dates back to the 17th century. The old fire station on Main Street was built in 1865, but it was closed in 1945 and is now a bus shelter.
East Haddon Hall is a Grade I listed building and was built in 1780 for the Sawbridge family by John Wagstaff, a builder from Daventry. It was built to a design by John Johnson of Leicester. The house was originally set in gardens laid out by garden designers Gertrude Jekyll and Edwin Lutyens in 1897, of which only fragments of the formal rose gardens and a sundial remain. The Hall Flats, an old sandstone building to the south of the hall, has a 1663 date stone and were part of the old stable block to the hall.

The Red Lion Inn can be traced back to 1765, although the present building was previously used as an off license while the inn was in what is now Hall Farm to the west of the premises. The Red Lion has been in its present home since the early 20th century, where it continues to trade as a pub, restaurant and hotel under the Wells &amp; Co company. The Red Lion Cottage within the grounds is listed and was built in 1695.

==Transport==

East Haddon is served by the main A428 road, which passes the southern edge of the village. Further afield, junctions 16 and 18 of the M1 motorway are approximately 8 miles from the village. Junction 1 of the A14 road is also 8 miles north of the village which provides connections eastwards and westwards.

Long Buckby railway station is the closest railway station with services by West Midlands Trains. It lies on the Northampton loop of the West Coast Main Line running between Birmingham New Street and London Euston. The former Althorp Park railway station was situated to the south of East Haddon, but closed in 1960 and was later demolished.

Regular Stagecoach Midlands bus services connect East Haddon to Northampton, Long Buckby, West Haddon, Crick and Rugby.

There is a network of public footpaths across the village as well as two long-distance footpaths, Macmillan Way and Via Beata, which both skirt the eastern side of the parish.

<doc id="1202949" wikidata="Q954956" url="?curid=1202949" title="Wau, Papua New Guinea">
<text>Wau is a town in Papua New Guinea, in the province of Morobe. It has a population of approx 5,000 and is situated at an altitude of around 1100 metres. Wau was the site of a gold rush during the 1920s and 30s when prospective gold diggers arrived at the coast at Salamaua and struggled inland along the Black Cat Track.

At the Battle of Wau in January 1943, the Australian Army stopped an advance by the Japanese. A road was established soon after World War II to Lae and this fostered the further development of local timber and agricultural industries that were originally established in support of the mining industry. While much of the mineral reserves have been extracted, industrial gold mining continues at Edie Creek and at the newly established Hidden Valley Gold Mine operated by Morobe Goldfields (a subsidiary of Harmony Gold - South Africa).

The Wau Ecology Institute is a biological research station situated near Wau.

==Gold mining history==

=== Gold rush ===

The first strike at Wau, the start of what would be known as the Morobe Goldfield, was made at Koranga Creek by William ‘Shark-Eye’ Park, probably towards the end of 1921. Park and his partner, Jack Nettleton, ran a clandestine mining operation for twelve months from April 1922 until a new Mining Ordinance enabled them to get their gold out legally. Nettleton, it is known, took out 6000 troy ounces, or about 190 kg, of gold in August 1923.

Only a handful of miners worked the field, rich as it was, until 1924. From 1924 to 1926 perhaps 20 miners were on the field producing about 200 kg of gold a year. The real rush began in 1926 with much bigger discoveries at Edie Creek, above Wau. The new rush made air transport viable and Wau&#x27;s airstrip opened in 1927 by the Parer brothers originally of Spanish descent. In 1928 there were 200 miners and production was about three tonnes a year.

The influx of miners was often in conflict with the area&#x27;s indigenous populations, including the Biangai along the Bulolo River and the Watut along the Watut River. During the early gold rush (1924–1927) prospectors and carriers employed from the coast followed paths through some of the Biangai villages. Accusations of theft from gardens against coastal carriers resulted a number being killed. In response, miners burned a Biangai village, and killed three men and a woman who died in a house that was burnt down. The beginning of air transport reduced the need for lines of carriers. In 1972, in the 6000 hectares case, PNGLR 71 (19 July 1972) the Biangai won the restitution of the Morobe Goldfields in the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea and compensation was awarded in respect of historical gold sales.

===Companies===
Park quit Wau in 1926 as a wealthy man. After this properly capitalised companies were formed. New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd (NGG) was the biggest operator, but there were many others: for example, Koranga Gold Sluicing, Sandy Creek Gold Sluicing, Edie Creek Gold Mining Company, The Golden Deeps N.L., Upper Watut Gold Alluvials, Placer Development Limited, and so on. In subsequent years, NGG consolidated control over much of the mineral reserves using its large capitalisation to purchase the smaller leases.

Underground mining began with the Day Dawn mine in 1931; a number of similar operations were opened before and after the Second World War. These mines were very small by modern standards, the biggest being Upper Ridges with a total production of 2.9 tonnes over eighteen years.

Open cut mining was carried out at Golden Ridges mine between 1932 and 1941, and other pits yielded gold in the Namie area both before and after the war. Most were small and short-lived; the richest was Golden Peaks, producing about six and half tonnes of gold between 1962 and 1977. The Golden Peaks mill also processed ore brought to it by an aerial ropeway from new workings at Upper Ridges.

Bulolo Gold Dredging (BGD) began operations at the sister town of Bulolo in 1932 and was responsible for the bulk of pre-war gold production: about 40 tonnes in total. Seven of the eventual eight dredges worked the Bulolo Valley gravels; one only, No. 6, worked in the Wau Valley. Large operations ceased to be attractive after WWII, partly due to pegging of the gold price at pre-war prices and the last dredge ceased operating in 1965.

===Alluvial mining===
At peak production, the Morobe Goldfield was the largest consumer of indentured labour in the Territory of New Guinea. On 30 June 1936 there were 13,121 labourers in Morobe as a whole, 6816 of whom were classified as involved in mining at Wau and Bulolo. But that was the limit of local involvement until 1957 when the Administration began to issue miner’s permits to Papua New Guineans. By this time the peak of alluvial production was past, but from this point the proportion of the total in local hands rose to 80% by 1975, according to a 1975 analysis of buying records.

Most of the miners were, and still are, operating with the simple methods of dishing and boxing, or gold panning. They make little capital expenditure and have a limited ability to discover new reefs. Production has dropped steadily since a post-war peak in 1953, as the small-scale miners attempt to make a living from alluvial ground constantly worked over since the 1920s.

===Timber mills===
Timber mills in Wau were started by Roy Hyde in 1935, who arrived with his wife, two sons and a daughter. Timber was floated down the Bulolo river to the coast, which was used for house building in Lae and other resorts along the coast. Natives would guide the rafts to their destinations.

===Notable people===
*John Laws, Australian radio personality, born in Wau 8 August 1935.

<doc id="1202953" wikidata="Q2466318" url="?curid=1202953" title="Dodford, Northamptonshire">
<text>Dodford is a village in West Northamptonshire, England. Prior to local government changes in 2021 it was within the Weedon Ward of Daventry District. The village is just north of the A45 road west of Weedon. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 203. It is east of Daventry and west of Northampton. It is also close to junction 16 of the M1 motorway. The parish consists of some and is bounded on the east by the A5 trunk road which is the old Roman road of Watling Street. Most of the village and parish sits astride the valley of an east-flowing stream which is a tributary of the River Nene.

==Medieval history and later==
The villages name means &#x27;Dodda&#x27;s ford&#x27;.

There are considerable earthworks around the village on the northern side of the stream, which indicate that Dodford was a larger settlement than it is today. Many of these earthworks have been ploughed out in recent years, but the evidence has been recorded of their existence. These earthworks suggest that there was a large scale de-population or a considerable movement of the village. Dodford is mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 944. The village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a manor of three hides belonging to Robert, Count of Mortain (who was the half-brother of William the Conqueror), with a recorded population of 22 including a priest. In 1222 the manor of Dodford was acquired by William de Keynes, who enclosed much of the land including a deer park which lay to the south of the village, between it and what is now the A45 between Daventry and Weedon. In 1673 it is recorded that 39 people paid Hearth Tax. By the early part of the 18th century there were 21 dwellings in the village, and a map dated 1742 shows the layout of the village much as it is today. In 1801 the village is recorded as having 205 residents.

==St Mary the Virgin church==

Dodford has a Grade I listed parish church, called St Mary the Virgin. It was founded by the Normans in 1066, rebuilt by Ralph de Keynes in 1100, and the tower and north chapel were added by William de Keynes in 1221. St Mary&#x27;s has a nave with a north aisle and a clerestory on the north side only. The arcade, of four bays, is 14th century. The south wall of the nave has two plain 12th century splayed windows, of which the west one is now blocked, and part of the plain arch of a doorway; on the exterior there is much herringbone masonry. The south porch is of two storeys. The chancel was rebuilt in the 19th century. The church contains an elaborately-carved 12th century font.

Dodford church has the distinction of being the first church that the antiquary Elias Ashmole (founder of the Ashmolean Museum) is known to have visited with the aim of recording its inscriptions, armorial bearings etc. Ashmole visited Dodford church on 15 April 1657, and his handwritten notes are now in the Bodleian Library.

There is a tall 13th century west tower which was structurally crumbling until major repairs in the late 20th century. It contains a ring of six bells, each of which was cast in a different year between 1614 and 1907. The bells hang in a timber frame placed diagonally in the tower. This is a weak layout and the bells remained neglected and unringable for several decades until essential frame strengthening was carried out in 2007.

<doc id="1202968" wikidata="Q2426813" url="?curid=1202968" title="Huish, Wiltshire">
<text>Huish is a small village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Wilcot, Huish and Oare, in Wiltshire, England, northwest of Pewsey and southwest of Marlborough. In 2011 the parish had a population of 43. It is on the south-facing edge of the Marlborough Downs, where the downs adjoin the Vale of Pewsey.

== History ==
A small settlement of 11 households was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, when the lord of the manor was Richard Sturmy or Esturmy. The population of the parish remained low, reaching around 130 at its height between 1831 and 1881, then declining to 30 at the 1971 census.

The church and Manor Farm lie some 250 metres north of the present village, along a lane which continues (now as a track) some 1.5 km northwest to the site of the deserted village of Shaw, now in the parishes of Alton and West Overton. By the 18th century there was a hamlet on Huish Hill, straddling the boundary with Wilcot, some 900 metres north of Oare at ; this hamlet began to be abandoned in the 1920s.

In 1803, land to the west of Oare village which belonged to the lords of Huish was deemed part of Huish parish. Thus the southeast boundary of Huish extends close to Oare, and Oare school (now Oare Church of England Primary School) is within Huish parish.

Cold Blow, a thatched house on the outskirts of Oare, was built in 1921–22 to designs of Clough Williams-Ellis.

A heart-shaped tree plantation was created in 1999, below Huish Hill in the southeast of the parish, near Oare. This is a geoglyph, but not a hill figure like the many surrounding &quot;white horses&quot; such as the Marlborough White Horse.

== Local government ==
The first tier of local government is the parish of Wilcot, Huish and Oare, which elects a parish council. Huish was anciently a parish in its own right, until 1 April 2021 when it was merged with the larger neighbouring parish of Wilcot to form &quot;Wilcot, Huish and Oare&quot;. At the time of the merger Huish had 37 electors, and for a number of years had elected a joint parish council with Wilcot.

Huish falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

== Parish church ==
A church was recorded at Huish in 1291. The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas was rebuilt in 1785, near the foundations of the 13th-century church but in a smaller size; it was again rebuilt in 1878–9.

In 1924 the benefices of Huish and Oare were united, with the parsonage house to be at Huish. Wilcot was added in 1962. In 1972 the parishes of Huish and Oare were united, and at the same time the benefice was extended by adding Woodborough with Manningford Bohune and Beechingstoke. Today the parish of Huish and Oare is part of the Vale of Pewsey team of churches.

The former rectory, a three-bay house in brick of c. 1812, is now a private house.

<text>The House of Gediminas (), or simply the Gediminids, were a dynasty of monarchs in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that reigned from the 14th to the 16th century. A cadet branch of this family, known as the Jagiellonian dynasty, reigned also in the Kingdom of Poland, Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Bohemia. Several other branches ranked among the leading aristocratic dynasties of Poland and Russia into recent times.

The Gediminas&#x27; Cap was used during the inaugurations of Gediminids as Lithuanian monarchs in the Vilnius Cathedral and symbolized the dynasty&#x27;s continuity.

Their monarchical title in Lithuanian primarily was, by some folkloristic data, &quot;kunigų kunigas&quot; (&quot;Duke of Dukes&quot;), and later on, &quot;didysis kunigas&quot; (&quot;Great/High Duke&quot;) or, in a simple manner, &quot;karalius or kunigaikštis&quot;. In the 18th century, the latter form was changed into tautological &quot;didysis kunigaikštis&quot;, which nevertheless would be translated as &quot;Grand Duke&quot; (for its etymology, see Grand Prince).

==Origin==
The origin of Gediminas himself is much debated. Some sources say he was Vytenis&#x27; ostler, others that he was of peasant stock. Some historians consider him as the son or grandson of Lithuanian or Yatvingian King/duke Skalmantas. Most scholars agree, however, that Gediminas was Vytenis&#x27; brother (the parentage of Vytenis is explained differently in various fake genealogies, compiled from the 16th century onwards; according to the latest Polish research, his parentage cannot be established).

==Confirmed Gediminid rulers==
* Gediminas
* Jaunutis
* Algirdas
* Jogaila
* Kęstutis
* Vytautas – King/Grand Duke from 1392 to 1430
* Švitrigaila
* Sigismund Kęstutaitis
* Casimir IV Jagiellon
* Alexander Jagiellon
* Sigismund I the Old
* Sigismund II Augustus

== Branches of the dynasty ==

The Eastern Orthodox branches of the family were initially Ruthenized to some extent. The majority of these families (e.g., Czartoryski) soon converted to Roman Catholicism and became Polonized. Others (e. g. the Golitsyn (Galitzine), Kurakin and Trubetskoy) moved to Muscovy, became thoroughly Russified and are among the princely families of Russia.

In Poland, some Gediminid families (such as Olelkowicz-Słucki, Wiśniowiecki, Zbaraski) are extinct, but others survive to the present: Chowański, Czartoryski, Sanguszko, Siesicki (Dowmont-Siesicki, Szeszycki), and Koriatowicz-Kurcewicz..

The Russian Gediminid families include Bulgakov, Golitsin, Kurakin, Khovansky, Troubetzkoy, Mstislavsky, Belsky, and Volynsky. Some of these families also survive, as of 2020.

<doc id="1202977" wikidata="Q798800" url="?curid=1202977" title="Bad Vöslau">
<text>Bad Vöslau (; Central Bavarian: &quot;Bod Vöslau&quot;) is a spa town and municipality in the state of Lower Austria. It is also known as the cradle of the Austrian red wine cultivation. The population, as of 2022, is 12,424.

== Geography ==
Bad Vöslau is located 35 km south of Vienna on the slope of the Vienna Woods mountains to the Vienna Basin. The &quot;Thermenlinie&quot; fault line running there is the cause of several thermal springs.

=== Municipality Structure ===
The municipality of Bad Vöslau is composed of three localities and cadastral communities, namely the city of Bad Vöslau, and the villages of Gainfarn and Großau.

== History ==
Traces of colonization dating back to the Neolithic period have been found in the area.

In the Roman era the place was a part of the province of Pannonia. Already then, people made use of the thermal springs in the area.

The name “Vöslau” (as in: &quot;Adololdus de Veselove&quot;) was first found in a written document of Klosterneuburg Monastery dating from 1136. At that time, the settlement was only a castle that was encircled by a ditch. It was destroyed by King Matthias Corvinus in 1483, but was subsequently rebuilt. It became of great significance during the Reformation movement.

During the Counter-Reformation the parish of Vöslau was incorporated in neighbouring Gainfarn parish.

In the 18th century, the Vöslau dominion was purchased by the influential Fries family. Count Johann von Fries, whose vineyards were situated around Vöslau, was the first to grow red wine on a large scale in this region. Under the Fries family, Vöslau flourished. The old castle was expanded and remodelled in Baroque style.

After Count Moritz von Fries had gone bankrupt in 1826, Giorgios Sinas acquired the dominion and palace of Vöslau, but sold it to Johann Heinrich von Geymüller the Younger, a Swiss banker, just one year later. In 1833, Geymüller established the Vöslau worsted wool factory &quot;(Vöslauer Kammgarnfabrik)&quot;, which became a major source of employment in Vöslau until it was closed down in 1978.

In 1841, the Southern Railway to (then) Neunkirchen was opened, so that Vöslau could now be reached by train via (now) Bad Vöslau railway station. In the second half of the 19th century, tourism became another major economic sector. Wealthy families used to spend the summer months in rented houses with their entire households. For this purpose, villas were built on the slopes west of the village centre. In 1822, a first public bath was opened; large portions of it were rebuilt between 1869 and 1873 by architect Theophil Hansen.

On 26 August 1867 the Treaty of Vöslau was signed between the Kingdom of Greece and the Principality of Serbia.

In 1904 Vöslau was officially declared a spa town; the name of the municipality, though, was not until 1928 changed to &quot;Bad&quot; Vöslau (by resolution of the &quot;Landtag&quot; of Lower Austrian [the state parliament] of 27 March 1928). The public swimming baths were again rebuilt and were opened on 20 June 1926, with Federal President Michael Hainisch attending.

In 1936, a company was founded to merchandise the thermal water, which is being sold under the brand name Vöslauer (add: &quot;Mineralwasser,&quot; i. e. mineral water) since then.

Wine-growing is also another important part of the economy. The red wine and the sparkling wine from Vöslau were made famous worldwide by Robert Schlumberger in the 19th century.

In 1954, Bad Vöslau became a city. In the same year, the brand &quot;Vöslauer Stadtsiegel&quot; was created. On 1 January 1972 the neighbouring municipalities of Gainfarn and Großau were incorporated into Bad Vöslau.

==Populations==

== Politics ==
The Bad Vöslau city council &quot;(Gemeinderat)&quot; consists of 37 seats. As of the 2020 elections, these are allocated as follows:

* 19 Liste Flammer (an independent party founded by Alfred Flammer)
* 7 GREEN Party
* 4 ÖVP
* 3 SPÖ
* 2 FPÖ
* 2 NEOS

== Economy and Traffic ==

=== Economy ===
The main sources of income in Bad Vöslau are tourism and wine-growing. Also, the Vöslauer mineral water from the thermal springs is bottled within the city limits and exported worldwide. On 11 February 2006 the new Bad Vöslau health resort was opened.

The area of the now defunct worsted factory has been refurbished by a group of investors and the premises are being let as storage, business, or office space under the name of &quot;Kammgarnzentrum&quot; (Worsted Centre). In the northeast of Bad Vöslau there are several shops and businesses.

=== Traffic ===

==== Road ====
The Bad Vöslauer Straße B212 runs through the centre of the city, connecting Bad Vöslau with Baden (north) and Berndorf (via Gainfarn and Großau, west). At Schlossplatz a branch road leads south to Kottingbrunn, Leobersdorf, and Wiener Neustadt.

Just east of the city is the Süd Autobahn. There is a junction leading to Bad Vöslau. The southern parts of town, however, can also easily be reached via the Kottingbrunn junction.

==== Rail and Public Transport ====
Bad Vöslau railway station is located in the east of the city, on the line of the &quot;Südbahn&quot; (Southern Railway). The station is served by local and regional trains. In front of the station building, public buses depart for various places in town and in the vicinity.

==== Air ====
Near the eastern limits of town (and, for the larger part, in the municipality of Kottingbrunn) lies Vöslau Airfield. It is a private airfield, without commercial traffic. It was noted as the place where on 15 April 1955 an Austrian government delegation headed by Federal Chancellor Julius Raab landed after returning from successful peace treaty negotiations with Soviet Union leaders in Moscow.

<doc id="1202978" wikidata="Q629997" url="?curid=1202978" title="Creaton">
<text>Creaton is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England.

==Location==
The village is north-west of the town of Northampton and south-east of the city of Leicester, along the A5199, formerly designated as the A50 trunk road. The road is known as Welford Road in the village and runs along the top of the ridge on which the village stands giving it extensive views east and west. About north on the road the A5199 connects with the A14 trunk road, a dual carriageway connecting the M1 and M6 motorways from the Catthorpe Interchange with Kettering, Cambridge, Ipswich and the port of Felixstowe.

==Governance==
The village has its own Parish Council and is part of Daventry Parliamentary Constituency. The Daventry constituency has been represented by a member of the Conservative Party since 1974.

The village is currently governed by West Northamptonshire council. Before local government changes the local district council was Daventry District Council where Creaton was in Spratton ward together with the villages of Cottesbrooke, Spratton itself and surrounding rural areas. The village was in the Northamptonshire County Council area.

==History==
The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &#x27;Creaton Magna&#x27; (now the main part of the village) and &#x27;Creaton Parva&#x27; (now Little Creaton). In the centre of the village, across Grooms Lane, are the foundations of the house where Amphylis Twigden, great-great-grandmother of George Washington, first President of the United States was born and lived. Twigden married the Revd Lawrence Washington, son of Lawrence Washington (1602–1652). Their son, John Washington, emigrated to America and was the father of George.

On 22 July 1944 at 22:53hrs, 92 Group RAF informed Flying Control at RAF Husbands Bosworth that a V1 Flying Bomb was heading in their direction. However, at 22.57hrs a message was received that the bomb had crashed on Creaton. Severe damage was done to houses in the village but nobody was killed.

==Demographics==
The 2001 census showed that there were 488 people living in the village, 243 male, 245 female, with average age 39.18 years. The 2011 census showed an increase in population to 503. There were 196 dwellings of which 7 unoccupied, 182 of them with central heating and 155 being owner occupied.

==Buildings==
Creaton has a typical English village green which is a large focal point with a number of interesting buildings including the Manor House, built in 1604. Also overlooking the green are a terrace of almshouses which were founded in 1825 and rebuilt in 1897. There a brick-built United Reformed chapel, originally erected as a non-conformist chapel in 1604, though the current building dates from 1793. A number of houses are thatched and built of the local sandstone. One of the cottages, Moringside, has a doorway from Holdenby Palace. Traditional hunt meets were frequently held on the green; hunting in the area is now run within the bounds of the current legislation. Creaton also has a village park which has a full sized football pitch.

The village has a medieval church, dedicated to St. Michael and All Angels (Church of England) with a low stone tower. The church dates from the 12th century.

The village public house is the Bricklayers Arms, on Welford Road. On the southern edge of the village is Highgate House, a conference centre and former 17th century coaching inn. The village won village of the year 2008 and the now-closed local shop won an award.

The village has a new village shop which was erected on the Welford Road and opened in August 2018 after a successful community fundraiser.

Although in fact within the boundaries of the parochial parish of Hollowell, Creaton Hospital (formally the Northampton County Sanatorium) stood at the bottom of the hill on the other side of the Welford Road. This was a tuberculosis hospital in operation between 1910 and 1979, converted to 13 private houses in the early 1980s and now called Highfield Park.

Nearby historic buildings include Cottesbrooke Hall and estate ca. north; Holdenby House and Althorp ca. and south respectively; Coton Manor Garden and Ravensthorpe Reservoir both ca. west; the 7th Century Saxon church at Brixworth ca. east.

==Other facilities==
* Ducklings Pre-School operates out of the site of the old primary school which was closed in December 2018.
* There are two small industrial and business estates: one is off Grooms Lane, near Highgate House; the other is along the Brixworth Road on the outskirts of Creaton, known as Twigden Barns.
* It also boasts a playing field with many walks around it and a small children&#x27;s park Creatons Children&#x27;s Park

The manor of &quot;Codesbroc&quot; is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was held in-chief from the king by &quot;Dodin&quot;, who held seven other manors as a mesne tenant, all in Northamptonshire. It consisted of 1 villager, 1 slave, 1 ploughland and the annual value to lord was 2 shillings in 1086. It was afterwards held, in whole or in part, by the family of de Buttivillar / Butvilleyne / Butvillain / Butwillam / Bontvillain. Part of the manor of Cottesbrooke, namely an estate called &quot;Kalender&quot; or &quot;Kayland&quot;, was given to Sulby Abbey by William de Buttivillar, soon after the foundation of that abbey in 1155. It became the site of a monastic grange or cell, situated in the N.W. corner of the parish of Cottesbrooke, of Premonstratensian Canons, founded soon after 1155 and probably abandoned by 1291. Juliana Butvilleyne, the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Robert Butvilleyne of Cottesbrooke, married Robert Duke of Brompton in Suffolk, whose eventual heir was the Kempe family of Gissing in Norfolk (Kempe baronets), who quartered the arms of Butvilleyne (&quot;Argent, three crescents gules&quot;)

The estate with Cottesbrooke Hall, built 1702, was bought by the Langham baronets, a family of London turkey merchants, in 1637, previously belonging to the Saunders family. The estate was sold in 1911 to R. B. Brassey. In 1937 Cottesbrooke Hall was bought by its current owners, the MacDonald-Buchanan family, who in 1937-8 employed Lord Gerald Wellesley (later the 7th Duke of Wellington) to make alterations to the Hall, including changing the entrance front to the other side of the house.

==All Saints Church==
A long, cruciform church of &quot;&quot;1300, although the north transept has been demolished. Much restoration has been carried out on the building, most recently in 1959–60 by John Seely, Lord Mottistone. The large geometric windows cannot be relied upon and may have once been foliated. The south doorway and porch is in a good state, as is the West tower.

The tower has two-light Y-traced bell-openings supported by circular mullions, well preserved shafting on the interior windows with capitals, both carved and plain, and also a number of small exterior head-stops. It contains a ring of eight bells, comprising six bells cast by Henry Bagley II of Chacombe in 1702, with the heaviest bell (tenor) weighing and two lighter bells cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1995.

The two east windows, glazed with coloured panes, are believed to be Georgian in origin, being referred to as &#x27;recent&#x27; additions in documents dating from 1849. The nave roof has a ceiling, the painted imitation-plasterwork in the covings being of interest, believed to be 18th century work. During the last restoration, the plaster ceilings in the chancel and the remaining south transept were removed, exposing roof timbers from the 15th century.

There is a reredos and communion table by &quot;Lord Mottistone&quot; in the Wrenian style. These are placed halfway along the chancel so that a vestry is formed behind. A wooden font and cover dates from the 18th century and is kept at Cottesbrooke Hall and may be viewed by appointment. The church has one of few examples of a three-tier Georgian pulpit in the county and country, and is fitted with fine box pews. There is a staircase with balusters leading to the Squire&#x27;s pew in the south transept of similar date. There is a small &#x27;squint&#x27;, with delicately carved hood moulding, in the junction between the chancel and the south transept. The church plate, consisting of a Cup and Paten from 1635 and also two Flagons and a Breadholder of 1665, is held at Cottesbrooke Hall.

A number of large monuments include John Rede, d.1604 in the south chapel is of alabaster stone with a recumbent effigy in marble on a partially rolled mat. A flat arch spans two columns, with a large cartouche beneath. On the ground are the figures of 10 kneeling infants. Sir John Langham, (d.1671) and his wife&#x27;s monument is also in the south chapel. It is free-standing in grey and white marble with good cartouches on the tomb-chest. There are two recumbent effigies with much carving. The monument cost £290 in 1676 and is by Thomas Cartwright Senior.

Other Langham family monuments are: Mrs. Mary Langham, d.1773, in the chancel with a classical urn by Moore; Sir James, d.1795, with a long inscription and standing female figure beside an urn; Lady Langham, d.1807, with a figure of Faith standing by Bacon Junior; Marianne, d.1809, the memorial made in 1810, a simple a draped urn, by Bacon Junior; Lady Langham, d.1810, with number of columns and a depiction of the rock of Golgotha; Sir William, d.1812, a free-standing monument in the nave of Coade stone, by &quot;Bacon Junior&quot;.

<text>Cold Ashby is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 255 people, increasing to 278 at the 2011 census.

The villages name means &#x27;Ash-tree farm/settlement&#x27; or &#x27;Aski&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27;. &#x27;Cold&#x27; from its exposed situation.

Cold Ashby is surrounded by rolling farmland, and has a notable golf club. Its population is mainly commuters and their families, although farming is important to the local economy. The village has its own bowls and cricket clubs, and is within the catchment area of the Guilsborough schools. Lying on the contour line Cold Ashby is said to be the highest village in Northamptonshire.
The British Ordnance Survey&#x27;s first trig point, the triangular post used by surveyors, was erected on 18 April 1936 near Cold Ashby. More than 11,000 of the posts were erected across Britain to enable surveyors to create maps accurate to within metres by measuring angles and using trigonometry to calculate distances between the pillars.

<text>In Greek mythology and epic literature, the Curetes () were legendary people who took part in the quarrel over the Calydonian boar. Strabo mentioned that the Curetes were assigned multiple identities and places of origin (i.e. either Acarnanians, Aetolians, from Crete, or from Euboea). However, he clarified the identity of the Curetes and regarded them solely as Aetolians. Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentioned the Curetes as the old name of the Aetolians.

<text>Darrell Wayne Evans (born May 26, 1947) is an American former baseball player, coach and manager. He played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), beginning his career as a third baseman with the Atlanta Braves (1969–1976, 1989), alternating between first and third base with the San Francisco Giants (1976–1983), and playing much of his later career as a first baseman and then a designated hitter for the Detroit Tigers (1984–1988). He won a World Series championship with the Tigers in 1984. Evans had most of his success in the early and late stages of his career. He was a two-time All-Star, first with the Braves in 1973 and then with the Giants in 1983. He led MLB in home runs in 1985 with the Tigers, and walks in 1973 and 1974 with the Braves.

Born in Pasadena, California, Evans was the son of a professional fast pitch softball player. He attended Pasadena City College and helped lead the baseball and basketball teams to California junior college championships. In the majors, Evans had a breakout season in 1973, finishing third in MLB with 41 home runs and leading the league in runs created and walks. He was traded to the San Francisco Giants in the middle of his lackluster 1976 season. His best season with the Giants was his 1983 All-Star season when he hit 30 home runs and compiled a .378 on-base percentage in his last year with the team. Evans signed as a free agent with the Detroit Tigers prior to the 1984 season, winning the World Series in his first year with the team. He led MLB in home runs with 40 in 1985 at age 38, becoming the oldest player in history to accomplish the feat. By hitting his home runs in the American League, he also became the first in MLB history to have a 40-homer season in both the American and the National Leagues. Evans concluded his playing career with a return to the Braves in 1989.

Baseball historian Bill James rated Evans as &quot;the most underrated player in baseball history.&quot; He was the 22nd player in MLB history to hit 400 home runs and the second to hit at least 100 home runs with three different teams. His 1,605 walks ranked eighth in MLB history at the time of his retirement, and he drew 90 or more walks in eight separate seasons (reaching 100+ walks five times). His skill in drawing walks contributed to a .361 career on-base percentage despite a .248 career batting average. After retiring as a player, Evans served as a manager and coach in Minor League Baseball and independent leagues from 1990 to 2010. His career as a manager included stints with the Wilmington Blue Rocks and the Huntsville Stars in the minors.

==Early years==
Evans was born in 1947 in Pasadena, California, to Eleanor (née Salazar, 1923–2013) and Richard Evans, both of whom came from baseball families. His mother and her sister Margaret played professional fast pitch softball together for a national championship team in Southern California, and his aunt in particular was selected as an All-American outfielder. Evans attended his mother&#x27;s softball games as an infant and later served as the team&#x27;s bat boy. His father was a sheet metal mechanic who had played college baseball. Both of Evans&#x27; parents had relatives in professional baseball. His maternal grandfather Dave Salazar was a pitcher in the Chicago White Sox organization and played for the San Francisco Seals in the Pacific Coast League. His uncle Bob Evans had also played minor league ball in the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; organization. Evans attended John Muir High School in Pasadena. He played baseball at Muir as a right-handed throwing pitcher and third baseman who batted left handed. In March 1965, he threw a no-hitter for Muir.

In the fall of 1965, Evans enrolled at Pasadena City College (PCC). As a freshman during the 1965–66 academic year, he was the leading scorer for PCC&#x27;s basketball team and led the baseball team with a .423 batting average. In December 1965, he scored 12 points in a losing effort against a UCLA team featuring Lew Alcindor. During the 1966–67 academic year, he hit .451 for the PCC baseball team and led both the baseball and basketball teams to California junior college championships. His basketball coach during the 1966–67 season was Jerry Tarkanian. Evans received the school&#x27;s athlete of the year award in 1967, and he was later inducted into the PCC Hall of Fame as &quot;the ultimate in Pasadena City College legends.&quot;

==Professional baseball player==
===Minor leagues===
Evans was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1965, the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers in 1966, and the Philadelphia Phillies and Kansas City Athletics in 1967. He originally didn&#x27;t sign with the Cubs out of high school because he was planning to play baseball on full scholarship at the University of Southern California, but that did not materialize. In June 1967, he finally signed a pro contract with the Athletics, receiving a $15,000 signing bonus.

Evans played for three different minor league clubs during the 1967 season: Leesburg in the Florida State League, Peninsula in the Carolina League, and Bradenton of the Gulf Coast League. He compiled a .326 batting average with a .402 on-base percentage in 61 minor league games during the 1967 season. In his time at Bradenton, he hit .489. He was named 1967 player of the year in the Gulf Coast League.

He spent the 1968 season with Birmingham in the Southern League. Evans&#x27;s playing time was limited in 1967 and 1968 by his service in the United States Marine Corps. Evans later recalled that his arm was &quot;sore and gone&quot; after his discharge from the Marines, resulting in a poor performance in 1968. Evans compiled a .248 batting average and .299 on-base percentage in 56 games for Birmingham. Alf Van Hoose, sports editor of &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; recalled Evans as &quot;a terrible infielder&quot; with a &quot;smooth swing.&quot;

===Atlanta Braves===
====1969 to 1972 seasons====
In December 1968, after the A&#x27;s chose not to include Evans on their list of protected minor league players, Evans was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the Rule 5 draft for $25,000. Evans began the 1969 season with the Braves but was limited to pinch-hitting. In late April 1969, he was sent down to the Shreveport Braves in Double-A ball. He was then promoted to the Richmond Braves of the Triple-A International League where he hit .360 with a .433 on-base percentage in 59 games. He was recalled to Atlanta in late August 1969, but hit only .231 in 26 at bats.

Evans spent most of the 1970 season at Richmond where he hit .300 with 47 extra base hits and 83 RBIs in 120 games. He hit .318 in 44 at bats for Atlanta in 1970, but Atlanta manager Lum Harris continued to relegate Evans to the minors due to his &quot;mediocre fielding&quot;. Evans received the nickname &quot;Clank&quot; due to his fielding difficulties. He also acquired the nickname &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; due to his resemblance to the popular television puppet of the same name.

Evans began the 1971 season with Richmond where he was moved to the outfield and batted .307 with a .437 on-base percentage. In late May, Evans received an opportunity to become the Braves&#x27; starting third baseman when the team released Clete Boyer following Boyer&#x27;s open criticism of the team&#x27;s general manager. Evans appeared in 72 games at the third base for the 1971 Braves; he hit .242 in 260 at bats in his rookie season. Atlanta hitting coach (and later manager) Eddie Mathews worked with Evans on his fielding. Evans later recalled: &quot;Eddie was not only my manager, he was my friend. He used to talk to me, pump into me that I had to do it.&quot;

In 1972, Evans was the Braves&#x27; regular third baseman, appearing in 125 games. He demonstrated his control of the strike zone, drawing 90 walks (fifth in the National League) and compiling a .384 on-base percentage (seventh in the league). Although his 25 errors ranked second among National League third basemen, he improved defensively, leading the league&#x27;s third basemen with a range factor of 3.24 per game and ranking high among the league&#x27;s third basemen with 126 putouts (second), 273 assists (fourth), and 20 double plays (fourth).

====1973 breakout season====
Evans had a breakout season in 1973. He was selected as the reserve third baseman (behind starter Ron Santo) on the 1973 National League All-Star team, ultimately finishing the year with 41 home runs (third in MLB behind Willie Stargell and teammate Davey Johnson) and an on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) of .959 (third in MLB behind teammate Hank Aaron and Stargell). Evans also led the major leagues in walks with 125 and runs created with 143. With his high walk rate, he reached base 294 times, second only to Pete Rose, and had a .403 on-base percentage. Additionally, he was third in extra-base hits with 74, and also finished fourth in runs scored with 114 and fifth in RBIs with 105. This was the only season of Evans&#x27;s career where he had over 100 runs or 100 RBIs. He also ranked among the best defensive third basemen in the National League with a 3.08 range factor per game (first in NL), 124 putouts (second in NL), and 325 assists (second in NL). Evans told reporters in July 1973 that his defensive improvement &quot;has meant more to me than the home runs.&quot;

Evans&#x27; 1973 accomplishments were overshadowed by teammate Hank Aaron&#x27;s pursuit of Babe Ruth&#x27;s career home run record. Evans responded to the lack of attention to his accomplishments, telling reporters in August 1973: &quot;I can&#x27;t say it bothers me. Hell, I enjoy reading about Hank, just like everyone else.&quot; Evans hit before Aaron in the Braves&#x27; batting order, and in April the following season, he was on first base when Aaron hit his historic 715th home run. The 1973 Braves were the first team in major league history to have three players – Evans, Aaron, and Davey Johnson – hit at least 40 home runs. Despite the surge in power, the 1973 Braves finished fifth in the National League West with a 76–85 record due to a pitching staff that allowed the most runs in the National League.

====1974 to 1976 seasons====
Prior to the 1974 season, Evans pursued salary arbitration, where he was awarded a $52,500 salary. Evans appeared in 160 games at third base for the Braves. For the second consecutive year, he led the majors in walks, tallying a career-high 126 bases on balls. In a remarkable turn-around, the player formerly known as &quot;Clank&quot; had a 3.45 range factor and led all National League third basemen with a 2.7 Defensive Wins Above Replacement rating. He also ranked among the National League&#x27;s leaders with 269 times on base (fourth), 25 home runs (tied for sixth), 99 runs scored (seventh), and a 7.2 overall Wins Above Replacement rating (seventh). His 1974 performance was nevertheless considered disappointing in light of a 41-point drop in his batting average and expectations created by his 1973 season. Evans attributed his less impressive performance in part to &quot;personal problems, some private things that were bothering me.&quot;

The 1975 season was Evans&#x27; final full season with the Braves. Following the trade of Hank Aaron, Evans took over Aaron&#x27;s third spot in the batting over. After a strong start in April, Evans&#x27; output slowed. He ended up batting .243 in 156 games. His power output also declined, as he totaled just 22 home runs and 73 RBIs to go along with a .406 slugging percentage. Evans&#x27; output declined further at the start of the 1976 season. With Jerry Royster taking over at third base, Evans was moved to first base. After 44 games, Evans&#x27; batting average stood at .173 with only one home run. He sought to remedy the slump by switching from contact lenses to glasses. Evans later recalled: &quot;It was the one time in my career when I really doubted myself. I couldn&#x27;t seem to do anything right. I couldn&#x27;t see the ball very well and I wasn&#x27;t being patient at the plate. Then I&#x27;d take a pitch and it would be right down the middle.&quot;

===San Francisco Giants===

On June 13, 1976, the Braves traded Evans with Marty Perez to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for Willie Montañez, Craig Robinson, and two other players. He promptly became the Giants&#x27; starting first baseman. In his first season in San Francisco, Evans compiled a .222 batting average with 10 home runs in 92 games. In his early years with the Giants, Evans shifted between left field, third base, and first base. In 1978, he settled in at third base, starting 612 games at that position from 1978 to 1982.

In 1983, Evans shifted back to first base and had his best season in San Francisco. He was named to the National League All-Star team as a reserve first baseman, hit 30 home runs and compiled a .378 on-base percentage and .516 slugging percentage. He won the team&#x27;s 1983 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. Evans spent eight seasons with the Giants, appearing in 1,094 games, compiling a .255 batting average, .358 on-base percentage, and .422 slugging percentage with 142 home runs, 525 RBIs and 605 walks.

===Detroit Tigers===
====1984 season and World Series====
After the 1983 season, Evans entered the free agent market. He was selected by seventeen teams, more than any other player, in the November 1983 re-entry draft. The Los Angeles Dodgers, the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers were the big pursuers, but only the latter offered a three-year deal. In December 1983, he became the first &quot;big name&quot; free agent to be signed by the Detroit Tigers. He signed a three-year contract worth approximately $2.25 million.

Playing for the World Series champion 1984 Detroit Tigers, Evans hit a three-run home run in his first regular season game in a Detroit uniform on the road against Minnesota. One week later, he hit another three-run home run with his first swing at Tiger Stadium. For the season, he appeared in 131 games, 62 as the designated hitter, 47 at first base, and 19 at third base. His .238 batting average was the lowest since 1976, but 77 walks (seventh in the American League) boosted his on-base percentage to .353. He also totaled 16 home runs and 63 RBIs for the 1984 Tigers. In the 1984 World Series, Evans managed only one hit in 15 at bats for a .067 batting average.

Evans&#x27; father died at the end of July 1984 after a long battle with cancer, and Evans missed several games to attend the funeral in California. He later recalled that it was the greatest disappointment of his life that his father was not able to see him play in the World Series.

====1985 season and home run title====
Despite his noted leadership as an elder presence in the clubhouse, owner Tom Monagahn tried to trade Evans to New York in the off season due to his contract. However, this plot failed. In 1985, Evans had one of the best offensive seasons of his career. He appeared in 151 games, 113 at first base, 33 as the designated hitter, and seven at third base. At age 38, he led the major leagues with 40 home runs, while driving in 94 runs. He became the oldest player to register 40 home runs in American League history, a feat not topped until Nelson Cruz hit 41 homers for the Minnesota Twins in 2019 at age 38/39. Evans was also the oldest player to lead the American League in home runs, and the first player to hit 40 home runs in both the National and American Leagues. He also registered a .356 on-base percentage (as a result of drawing 85 walks), and his .519 slugging percentage was his best since his breakout season in 1973. He was selected by both Detroit sports writers and fans for the 1985 Tiger of the Year award.

====1986 to 1988 seasons====
At the start of the 1986 season, Detroit manager Sparky Anderson announced that Evans would not be the Tigers&#x27; first baseman and would instead be the team&#x27;s designated hitter. Evans publicly expressed his frustration at losing his spot in the lineup after hitting 40 home runs. In the end, Anderson relented, and Evans played 105 games at first base and 42 as the designated hitter for the 1986 Tigers. He hit 29 home runs (part of a Tigers infield in which all four players hit at least 20 homers) and had 85 RBIs while compiling a .356 on-base percentage.

Evans&#x27; three-year contract expired after the 1986 season, and the Tigers decided not to offer him a contract to avoid triggering Evans&#x27; arbitration rights. No other teams made offers to Evans, and in late February 1987, he signed a one-year contract with the Tigers; the contract cut his salary by $200,000 to between $500,000 and $550,000. During the 1987 season, Evans appeared in 150 games for the Tigers, including 105 at first base and 44 as the designated hitter. He drew 100 walks in 1987, fourth most in the American League, pumping his on-base percentage to .379, his highest since 1974. He also hit 34 home runs, had 99 RBIs (second most in his career), and finished 12th in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award. In the 1987 American League Championship Series, he compiled a .294 batting average and .455 on-base percentage. However, he was also picked off at third base in the fourth game of the ALCS, &quot;hammering the final nail&quot; into the Tigers&#x27; defeat.

Evans returned to Detroit for one last season in 1988. He appeared in 144 games (72 at DH, 65 at 1B) and had 22 home runs, including his 400th career homer in September, but he saw his batting average drop precipitously to .208. At the end of the 1988 season, the Tigers announced that Evans, age 41, would not be offered a contract for the 1989 season. Evans appeared in 727 games in five years with the Tigers, hit 141 home runs, and compiled a .358 on-base percentage and .450 slugging percentage.

===Swan song with the Braves===
In December 1988, Evans signed to return to the Atlanta Braves for the 1989 season. He appeared in 109 games with the 1989 Braves, compiling a .207 batting average with 11 home runs. He appeared in his final major league game on October 1, 1989, at age 42. At the beginning of April 1990, the Braves released Evans, ending his playing career. At the time, Evans told the Associated Press: &quot;It&#x27;s happened to a lot of my friends and it&#x27;s not easy. I guess when it slaps you in the face you don&#x27;t know how to feel. I don&#x27;t know what to expect because I&#x27;ve never been in this situation before.&quot; Evans appeared in 866 games in nine years with the Braves, hitting 131 home runs and compiling a .368 on-base percentage.

===Career highlights===
Evans played 21 seasons in the majors and appeared in 2,687 games. Evans compiled a .248 batting average (2,223-for-8,973) with 1,344 runs, 329 doubles, 36 triples, 414 home runs, 1,354 RBI, 98 stolen bases, 1,605 walks, 1,410 strikeouts, .361 on-base percentage and .431 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .973 fielding percentage.

Evans was the 22nd player in baseball history to total 400 home runs. He was also the first player to hit 40 home runs in a season in both leagues. He hit over 20 home runs in 10 different seasons, and he was only the second player in major league history (after Reggie Jackson) to hit at least 100 home runs with three different clubs. Evans hit 60 home runs after reaching age 40, at the time a major league record.

Evans averaged 97 walks per 162 games, and drew 100 or more walks five times (1973–1975, 1978, and 1987). His career total of 1,605 walks ranked eighth in major league history at the time of his retirement and remains 12th most in major league history.

Evans has been described by author and pioneering sabremetrician Bill James as &quot;the most underrated player in baseball history, absolutely number one on the list&quot;. In &quot;The Bill James Handbook 2019&quot;, James also rated Evans No. 7 on his list of &quot;The 25 Best Players Who Are Not in the Hall of Fame.&quot;

==Managerial and coaching career==

In June 1990, two months after his release by the Braves, Evans was hired by the New York Yankees as the team&#x27;s hitting instructor, amid rumors that he may eventually be asked to take over Stump Merrill&#x27;s job as manager. Evans was credited with making a change in rookie Kevin Maas&#x27; swing, allowing him to more effectively reach Yankee Stadium&#x27;s short right field fence. At the end of the 1990 season, the Yankees named Graig Nettles as its hitting coach and announced that Evans would not return in 1991.

Evans later worked as a minor-league instructor. He was also the manager for several minor league teams, including stints with the Tyler Wildcatters of the independent Texas-Louisiana League in 1997, the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the South Atlantic League in 1998, the Huntsville Stars in the Double-A Southern League in 1999, the Aberdeen Arsenal of the independent Atlantic League in 2000, and the Allentown Ambassadors in the independent Northern League in 2002.

From 2005 to 2007, Evans was the manager of the Long Beach Armada in the independent Golden Baseball League. He led Armada to the GBL championship in 2007. He then served in 2008 as the bench and hitting coach for the Orange County Flyers, a team managed by Gary Carter. The Flyers beat Calgary for the 2008 GBL championship.

Evans was hired in November 2009 as the first manager and director of player personnel for the newly-organized Victoria Seals of the GBL. In March 2010, he was fired after the owner learned that Evans was seeking employment as a manager with another club. Evans also managed the Palm Springs Chill in 2009 in the California Winter League. After being fired by the Victoria club, Evans was hired in 2010 as the manager of the St. George RoadRunners in the GBL.

==Family and later years==
Evans had four children. His oldest son was born during his first marriage. Then, Evans married Ladonna Martin-Evans and they had three children. In 1984, Evans publicly revealed that, in the summer of 1982, he and his wife had seen an unidentified flying object from the porch of their home in Pleasanton, California. Evans described the UFO hovering over his neighbor&#x27;s house as appearing &quot;like a flying wing&quot;, triangular in shape with no wings and with green and red lights on the sides and white lights on the back.

In the mid-2000s, Evans worked as a consultant for Netamin Corporation in the development of its Ultimate Baseball Online multiplayer online game.

<text>El Malpais National Monument is a National Monument located in western New Mexico, in the Southwestern United States. The name El Malpais is from the Spanish term &quot;Malpaís&quot;, meaning &quot;badlands&quot;, due to the extremely barren and dramatic volcanic field that covers much of the park&#x27;s area.

It is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways. There are many geologic features, including lava tubes and ice caves. There is also abundant wildlife to be encountered year round. Native Americans have used the area for centuries, and it became a National Monument in 1987.

==Geography and geology==

The lava flows, cinder cones, and other volcanic features of El Malpais are part of the Zuni-Bandera volcanic field, the second largest volcanic field in the Basin and Range Province. This volcanically active area on the southeast margin of the Colorado Plateau is located on the ancient Jemez Lineament, which provides the crustal weakness that recent magmatic intrusions and Cenozoic volcanism are attributed to.

The rugged pahoēhoē and ʻaʻā lava flows of the Zuni-Bandera eruptions (also called the Grants Lava Flows) filled a large basin, created by normal faulting associated with the Rio Grande Rift, between the high mesas of the Acoma Pueblo to the east, Mt. Taylor to the north, and the Zuni Mountain anticline to the northwest. Vents associated with these flows include Bandera Crater, El Calderon, and several other cinder cones; more than a dozen older cinder cones follow a roughly north–south distribution along the Chain of Craters west of the monument.

==Features==

El Malpais has many lava tubes; two are open to explore (unguided) with a free caving permit, available at NPS-staffed facilities. The two caves currently accessible by permit are Giant Ice in the Big Tubes area, and Lava Bomb in the Hoya de Cibola area. The Junction Bridge lava tube ia also accessible as part of the El Calderon trail.

A nearby scenic overlook at Sandstone Bluffs offers spectacular panoramic views over the monument&#x27;s lava flows.

==Natural history==
Some of the oldest Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca&quot;) on Earth can be found living in El Malpais Monument. In 2020, a new population of hart&#x27;s-tongue ferns (&quot;Asplenium scolopendrium&quot;) was discovered inside of a cave with basaltic lava flows in El Malpais, which represents the first confirmed population of the species in the United States or Canada west of the Mississippi; all other known populations of the fern are around the Great Lakes, Alabama, and Tennessee. Genetic analyses and surveys are currently being performed to determine the population&#x27;s variation and overall health.

El Malpais’ lava flows and associated lava-tubes provide a unique and critical roosting habitat for bats. These underground structures offer stable temperatures, protection, and proximity to limited water resources, making them essential hibernacula for diverse bat species, setting the park apart from others with similar woodlands and water resources. Conservation efforts to preserve these lava-tubes are vital for safeguarding bat populations, especially in light of potential threats like White-nose syndrome. From December 2010 to June 2013, all caves were temporarily closed to recreational use to protect bats from the spread of White Nose Syndrome (WNS) until a permitting process, including visitor screening for WNS, could be implemented. Recent research at El Malpais shows that the bacterial microbiome of bats and the bacterial microbiome in the caves can affect each other, which may provide more insight into the connections between cave environments, defense systems of bats, and WNS.

==History==

The area around El Malpais was used for resources, settlement, and travel by Oasisamerica cultures, Native Americans, and Spanish colonial and pioneer exploration. Archaeological sites remain in the park. People of the Acoma Pueblo used to utilize the lava tubes that would collect cold air as sanctuary to protect them from the heat above. Some caves hold ice year round, which can be 2,000 years old. The Acoma and Zuni Pueblos forged a trail through El Malpais that connected the Pueblos, a hundred miles apart. Along the trail, ice from the caves would be melted as a water source. 
In the 1940s the Malpais lava field was one of the eight candidate sites considered by the Manhattan Project to test detonate the first atomic bomb, the Trinity nuclear test, which did occur to the south at White Sands Proving Ground. The Department of Defense did use the site as a bombing range to train pilots during World War II.

After the war, the Bureau of Land Management became the administrator of the area. In 1987, President Reagan signed that created El Malpais National Monument and designated it a unit of the National Park Service. It is jointly managed with the nearby El Morro National Monument. The Acoma Pueblo did not want the United States to make the area a National Monument. They asked for their land back, as it was used for spiritual purposes. Congress did not agree and went ahead with the Monument, while allowing sections to be closed at the Pueblos&#x27; request for spiritual use.

== Flora and fauna ==
Over 190 species of birds can be seen in El Malpais, occupying various habitats the area offers. Raptors including red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, peregrine falcons, great horned owls, and wester screech-owls may be seen. The region also has significant reptile and amphibian biodiversity, including bullsnakes that mimic rattlesnakes, horned lizards that can double their size in self defense, venomous rattlesnakes, collared lizards that warm up in the sun, and canyon treefrogs that lay their eggs in the tinajas. Mammals found in the area include black bears, coyotes, elk, and bats. Many moths and butterflies can also be encountered in the park, including Western Tiger and Black Swallowtail, Mourning Cloak, Mexican Tiger Moth, and Giant Leopard Moth.

Conifers such as piñon, alligator juniper, oneseed juniper, Rocky Mountain juniper, ponderosa pine, quaking aspen, and Douglas fir are found here. Shrubs include sagebrush, rabbitbrush, mountain mahogany, Apache plume, and more. Many wildflowers, such as paintbrush, evening primrose, and desert globemallow can be seen. Prickly pear, claret cup, and cane cholla cacti can be found as well. Cinder phacelia is a flowering plant that can only be found in El Malpais or in Sunset Crater National Monument. Moss and other bryophyte gardens also form in El Malpais, as a result of ice melting and dripping water along humid, cool, sunlit cave entrances. 95 mosses and 15 liverworts have been documented, included species that aren&#x27;t usually found in New Mexico&#x27;s climate. Four vegetative communities are identified in the area, competing for space and resources. They are Grass-Shrub, Piñon-Juniper, Ponderosa Pine, and Lava Complex.

==Protection and management==

The U.S. National Park Service protects, manages, and interprets El Malpais National Monument. El Malpais Visitor Center (formerly The Northwest New Mexico Visitor Center) is just south of Exit 85 off I-40 in Grants, New Mexico.

The adjacent El Malpais National Conservation Area is protected and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. They staff the El Malpais National Conservation Area Ranger Station 8 miles down State Highway 117 south of I-40 Exit 89.

The Cibola National Forest conserves large natural areas, wildlife, and habitats in the surrounding region as well.

==In literature==
The second portion of the 1932 book &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley takes place on the &quot;savage reservation&quot;, which is located on land encompassing the park&#x27;s area.

The &quot;malpais&quot; is the setting for a western story, &quot;Flint&quot; (November, 1960) by Louis L&#x27;Amour. Flint is a successful business man who thinks he is dying of cancer and returns to a hidden campsite within the &quot;malpais&quot; he had learned of in his youth.

A scene in Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; takes place on the malpais.

<doc id="1203002" wikidata="Q499874" url="?curid=1203002" title="Crew resource management">
<text>Crew resource management or cockpit resource management (CRM) is a set of training procedures for use in environments where human error can have devastating effects. CRM is primarily used for improving aviation safety and focuses on interpersonal communication, leadership, and decision making in aircraft cockpits. Its founder is David Beaty, a former Royal Air Force and a BOAC pilot who wrote &quot;The Human Factor in Aircraft Accidents&quot; (1969). Despite the considerable development of electronic aids since then, many principles he developed continue to prove effective.

CRM in the US formally began with a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendation written by NTSB Air Safety Investigator and aviation psychologist Alan Diehl during his investigation of the 1978 United Airlines Flight 173 crash. The issues surrounding that crash included a DC-8 crew running out of fuel over Portland, Oregon, while troubleshooting a landing gear problem.

The term &quot;cockpit resource management&quot;—which was later generalized to &quot;crew resource management&quot;—was coined in 1979 by NASA psychologist John Lauber, who for several years had studied communication processes in cockpits. While retaining a command hierarchy, the concept was intended to foster a less-authoritarian cockpit culture in which co-pilots are encouraged to question captains if they observed them making mistakes.

CRM grew out of the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster, in which two Boeing 747 aircraft collided on the runway, killing 583 people. A few weeks later, NASA held a workshop on the topic, endorsing this training. In the US, United Airlines was the first airline to launch a comprehensive CRM program, starting in 1981. By the 1990s, CRM had become a global standard.

United Airlines trained their flight attendants to use CRM in conjunction with the pilots to provide another layer of enhanced communication and teamwork. Studies have shown the use of CRM by both work groups reduces communication barriers and problems can be solved more efficiently, leading to increased safety. CRM training concepts have been modified for use in a wide range of activities including air traffic control, ship handling, firefighting, and surgery, in which people must make dangerous, time-critical decisions.

==Overview==

The current generic term &quot;crew resource management&quot; (CRM) has been widely adopted but is also known as cockpit resource management; flightdeck resource management; and command, leadership and resource management. When CRM techniques are applied to other arenas, they are sometimes given unique labels, such as maintenance resource management, bridge resource management, or maritime resource management.

CRM training encompasses a wide range of knowledge, skills, and attitudes including communications, situational awareness, problem solving, decision making, and teamwork; together with all the attendant sub-disciplines which each of these areas entails. CRM can be defined as a system that uses resources to promote safety within the workplace.

CRM is concerned with the cognitive and interpersonal skills needed to manage resources within an organized system rather than with the technical knowledge and skills required to operate equipment. In this context, cognitive skills are defined as the mental processes used for gaining and maintaining situational awareness, for solving problems and for making decisions. Interpersonal skills are regarded as communications and a range of behavioral activities associated with teamwork. In many operational systems, skill areas often overlap and are not confined to multi-crew craft or equipment, and relate to single operator equipment or craft.

Aviation organizations including major airlines and military aviation have introduced CRM training for crews. CRM training is now a mandated requirement for commercial pilots working under most regulatory bodies, including the FAA (US) and EASA (Europe). The NOTECHS system is used to evaluate non-technical skills. Following the lead of the commercial airline industry, the US Department of Defense began training its air crews in CRM in the mid 1980s. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy require all air crew members to receive annual CRM training to reduce human-error-caused mishaps. The U.S. Army has its own version of CRM called Aircrew Coordination Training Enhanced (ACT-E).

== Case studies ==

===United Airlines Flight 173===

When the crew of United Airlines Flight 173 was making an approach to Portland International Airport on the evening of Dec 28, 1978, they experienced a landing gear abnormality. The captain decided to enter a holding pattern so they could troubleshoot the problem. The captain focused on the landing gear problem for an hour, ignoring repeated hints from the first officer and the flight engineer about their dwindling fuel supply, and only realized the situation when the engines began flaming out. The aircraft crash-landed in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, over short of the runway. Of the 189 people aboard, two crew members and eight passengers died. The NTSB Air Safety Investigator Alan Diehl wrote in his report:

Diehl was assigned to investigate this accident and realized it was similar to several other major airline accidents including the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 and the runway collision between Pan Am and KLM Boeing 747s at Tenerife.

=== United Airlines Flight 232 ===

Captain Al Haynes, pilot of United Airlines Flight 232, credits CRM as being one of the factors that saved his own life, and many others, in the Sioux City, Iowa, crash of July 1989:

=== Air France 447 ===

One analysis blames failure to follow proper CRM procedures as being a contributing factor that led to the 2009 fatal crash into the Atlantic Ocean of Air France Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. The final report concluded the aircraft crashed after temporary inconsistencies between the airspeed measurements—likely due to the aircraft&#x27;s pitot tubes being obstructed by ice crystals—caused the autopilot to disconnect, after which the crew reacted incorrectly, causing the aircraft to enter an aerodynamic stall from which it did not recover.

Following recovery of the black box two years later, independent analyses were published before and after the official report was issued by the BEA, France&#x27;s air safety board. One was a French report in the book &quot;Erreurs de Pilotage&quot; written by Jean-Pierre Otelli, which leaked the final minutes of recorded cockpit conversation. According to &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, which examined the cockpit conversation just before the crash:
The men are utterly failing to engage in an important process known as crew resource management, or CRM. They are failing, essentially, to cooperate. It is not clear to either one of them who is responsible for what, and who is doing what.

=== First Air Flight 6560 ===

The Canadian Transportation Safety Board (CTSB) determined a failure of crew resource management was largely responsible for the crash of First Air Flight 6560, a Boeing 737-200, in Resolute, Nunavut, on August 20, 2011. A malfunctioning compass gave the crew an incorrect heading, although the instrument landing system and Global Positioning System indicated they were off course. The first officer made several attempts to indicate the problem to the captain but a failure to follow airline procedures and a lack of a standardized communication protocol to indicate a problem led to the captain dismissing the first officer&#x27;s warnings. Both pilots were also overburdened with making preparations to land, resulting in neither being able to pay full attention to what was happening.

First Air increased the time dedicated to CRM in their training as a result of the accident, and the CTSB recommended regulatory bodies and airlines to standardize CRM procedures and training in Canada.

=== Qantas Flight 32 ===

The success of the Qantas Flight 32 flight has been attributed to teamwork and CRM skills. Susan Parson, the editor of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Safety Briefing wrote; &quot;Clearly, the QF32 crew&#x27;s performance was a bravura example of the professionalism and airmanship every aviation citizen should aspire to emulate&quot;.

Carey Edwards, author of &quot;Airmanship&quot; wrote:

Their crew performance, communications, leadership, teamwork, workload management, situation awareness, problem solving and decision making resulted in no injuries to the 450 passengers and crew. QF32 will remain as one of the finest examples of airmanship in the history of aviation.

==Adoption in other fields==
===Transportation===
The basic concepts and ideology of CRM have proven successful in other related fields. In the 1990s, several commercial aviation firms and international aviation safety agencies began expanding CRM into air traffic control, aircraft design, and aircraft maintenance. The aircraft maintenance section of this training expansion gained traction as &quot;maintenance resource management&quot; (MRM). To attempt to standardize industry-wide MRM training, the FAA issued Advisory Circular 120–72, &quot;Maintenance Resource Management Training&quot; in September 2000.

Following a study of aviation mishaps between 1992 and 2002, the United States Air Force determined that close to 18% of its aircraft mishaps were directly attributable to human error in maintenance, which often occurred long before the flight in which the problems were discovered. These &quot;latent errors&quot; include failures to follow published aircraft manuals, lack of assertive communication among maintenance technicians, poor supervision, and improper assembly practices. In 2005, to address these human-error-induced aircraft mishaps, Lt Col Doug Slocum, Chief of Safety at the Air National Guard&#x27;s (ANG) 162nd Fighter Wing, Tucson, directed the modification of the base&#x27;s CRM program into a military version called &quot;maintenance resource management&quot; (MRM).

In mid-2005, the Air National Guard&#x27;s Aviation Safety Division converted Slocum&#x27;s MRM program into a national program available to the Air National Guard&#x27;s flying wings in 54 U.S. states and territories. In 2006, the Defense Safety Oversight Council (DSOC) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) recognized the mishap-prevention value of this maintenance safety program by partially funding a variant of ANG MRM for training throughout the U.S. Air Force. This ANG initiated, DoD-funded version of MRM became known as Air Force Maintenance Resource Management (AF-MRM) and is now widely used in the U.S. Air Force.

The Rail Safety Regulators Panel of Australia has adapted CRM to rail as &quot;rail resource management&quot; and developed a free resource kit. Operating train crews at the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in the United States are instructed on CRM principles during yearly training courses.

CRM has been adopted by merchant shipping worldwide. The STCW Convention and STCW Code, 2017 edition, published by the I.M.O. states the requirements for &quot;bridge resource management&quot; and &quot;engine room resource management&quot; training. These are approved shore-based training, simulator training, or approved in-service experience. Most maritime colleges hold courses for deck and engine room officers. Refresher courses are held every five years. These are referred to as &quot;maritime resource management&quot;.

===Firefighting===
Following its successful use in aviation training, CRM was identified as a potential safety improvement program for the fire services. Ted Putnam advocated for improved attention to human factors that contribute to accidents and near misses, building on CRM principles. In 1995, Dr. Putnam organized the first Human Factors Workshop for wildland fire. Dr. Putnam also wrote a paper that applied CRM concepts to the violent deaths of 14 Wildland firefighters on the South Canyon Fire in Colorado.

From this paper, a movement was initiated in the Wildland and Structural Fire Services to apply CRM concepts to emergency response situations. Various programs have since been developed to train emergency responders in these concepts and to help track breakdowns in these stressful environments.

The International Association of Fire Chiefs published its first CRM manual for the fire service in 2001. It is currently in its third edition. Several industry-specific textbooks have also been published.

===Healthcare===
Elements of CRM have been applied in US healthcare since the late 1990s, specifically in infection prevention.
For example, the &quot;central line bundle&quot; of best practices recommends using a checklist when inserting a central venous catheter. The observer checking off the checklist is usually lower-ranking than the person inserting the catheter. The observer is encouraged to communicate when elements of the bundle are not executed; for example if a breach in sterility has occurred.

====TeamSTEPPS====
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, also provides training based on CRM principles to healthcare teams. This training, called Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS), and the program is currently being implemented in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and primary care clinics around the world. TeamSTEPPs was designed to improve patient safety by teaching healthcare providers how to better collaborate with each other by using tools such as huddles, debriefs, handoffs, and check-backs. Implementing TeamSTEPPS has been shown to improve patient safety. There is evidence TeamSTEPPS interventions are difficult to implement and are not universally effective. There are strategies healthcare leaders can use to improve their chance of implementation success, such as using coaching, supporting, empowering, and supporting behaviors.

<doc id="1203003" wikidata="Q2464628" url="?curid=1203003" title="S and T-class destroyer">
<text>The S and T class was a class of sixteen destroyers of the Royal Navy launched in 1942–1943. They were built as two flotillas, known as the 5th and 6th Emergency Flotilla, and they served as fleet and convoy escorts in World War II.

==Design features==
The S class introduced the CP (central pivot) Mark XXII mounting for the QF Mark IX 4.7 in guns. This new mounting had a shield with a sharply raked front, to allow increased elevation (to 55 degrees), contrasting noticeably with the vertical front of the previous CP Mark XVIII, and easily differentiated the S class onwards from their immediate predecessors. &quot;Savage&quot; was the exception in this respect, being fitted with four 4.5 in guns; a twin mounting forward and two singles aft. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer.

The quadruple mounting Mark VII for the QF 2-pounder pom-poms was replaced by the twin mounting Mark IV for the 40 mm Bofors gun. Known as the &quot;Hazemeyer&quot; (or &quot;Haslemere&quot;), this advanced mounting was tri-axially stabilised in order that a target could be kept in the sights on the pitching deck of a destroyer and was fitted with an analog fire control computer and Radar Type 282, a metric range-finding set. The Hazemeyer design had been brought to Britain by the Dutch minelayer &quot;Willem van der Zaan&quot; that had escaped from the German occupation in May 1940.

The T class also was the first class to replace pole or tripod foremasts with lattice masts, which continued in subsequent War Emergency Flotillas.

<doc id="1203006" wikidata="Q1772233" url="?curid=1203006" title="Charwelton">
<text>Charwelton is a village and civil parish about south of Daventry in Northamptonshire, England. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population (including Fawsley) as 220.

The villages name means &#x27;River Cherwell farm/settlement&#x27;.

The present village, formerly called Upper or Over Charwelton, is where the main road between Daventry and Banbury, now the A361 road, crosses the river. The parish church is almost southeast at Church Charwelton, which is a hamlet and deserted medieval village.

The Jurassic Way long distance footpath between Banbury and Stamford passes through both Church Charwelton and Upper Charwelton.

== Manor ==
There were several small manors in the parish. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the largest as being two hides and &quot;four-fifths of half a hide&quot; held by one Ralf of Robert, Count of Mortain. In the 12th century this manor was recorded as two hides and four &quot;small virgates&quot; in the fee of Berkhamsted. (There were 10 &quot;small virgates&quot; to a hide.) Thorney Abbey had an estate at Charwelton: the Domesday Book records it has half a hide; in the 12th century it was recorded as four small virgates. Domesday records William de Cahagnes holding half a hide at Charwelton of the Count of Mortain; in the 12th century Hugh de Chaham held the same half hide of the fee of the Earl of Leicester. Domesday records that Hugh de Grandmesnil held one virgate at Charwelton; in the 12th century this estate was recorded as four small virgates held of the Earl of Leicester. Also in the 12th century there was an estate of four small virgates in the fee of Adam de Napton.

At the end of the 12th century William and Ralf de Cheinduit granted a manor at Charwelton to the Cistercian Biddlesden Abbey in Buckinghamshire. The Abbey retained the manor until it was forced to surrender all its properties to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538.

Charwelton Manor House contains much early 16th century panelling, an early 17th-century fireplace and a late 17th-century staircase. It is an ironstone building of two storeys with a hipped roof. Its present façade of five bays was added probably early in the 18th century.

== Parish church ==
The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity is at Church Charwelton. Its earliest features include the west windows of the south aisle, which are a stepped trio of lancet windows from about 1300. Holy Trinity has both a south and a north aisle, and the latter has a Decorated Gothic three-bay arcade. The west tower also is Decorated Gothic. The south porch is Perpendicular Gothic and the font may be 15th century. The chancel was largely rebuilt in 1901–04. Holy Trinity is a Grade I listed building.

Holy Trinity contains a series of monuments to the Andrewe or Andrewes family. Several family members who died late in the 15th or early in the 16th century are commemorated by monumental brasses. The largest are a pair long representing Thomas Andrewe (died 1496) and his wife. From the latter half of the 16th century are two carved stone monuments. A tomb-chest bears recumbent effigies of Sir Thomas Andrew (died 1564) and his two successive wives, while a well-carved relief in fine white stone commemorates Thomas Andrew (died 1590) and his family. The church interior also includes decoration by the artist Henry Bird of Northampton.

The church tower has a ring of five bells. Thomas I Newcombe, whose bell-foundry may have been in Leicester, cast the fourth bell in 1510. Hugh II Watts, who had foundries in Leicester and Bedford, cast the tenor bell in 1630. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the treble bell in 1716. John Taylor &amp; Son of Loughborough cast the current second and third bells in 1844.

Holy Trinity parish is part of the Benefice of Badby with Newnham and Charwelton with Fawsley and Preston Capes, which was formed in 1991.

== Economic and social history ==

Charwelton&#x27;s earliest surviving crossing over the river is a narrow packhorse bridge at Upper Charwelton, only wide between parapets. It has two arches and one cutwater, and may be 15th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The &quot;Nomina Villarum&quot; of 1316 records Church Charwelton by name, but in 1491 John Rous recorded that it was in danger of being depopulated and in 1791 John Bridges recorded that much of its population had gone. Bridges claimed the Wars of the Roses in the late 15th century had caused this, but modern scholarship identifies the Andrewes family&#x27;s sheep farming as the cause. In 1417 the merchant Thomas Andrews bought a small estate at Charwelton, and later he and his son, also called Thomas, leased much land in the parish. By 1547 a third Thomas Andrews was keeping 1,200 sheep here and two other landholders kept 500 and 300 respectively.

North of Upper Charwelton, between the village and Charwelton Hall, are the earthworks of an abandoned part of the village. Just west of Charwelton Hall are traces of former ponds dug beside the Cherwell. They are recorded as having been fish ponds, but they had artificial islands in them that suggests they were made for wild fowl.
The parish&#x27;s common fields were enclosed by agreement in 1531. Much of the ridge and furrow pattern of the common fields is still visible, and is best preserved along the Cherwell valley.

Earthworks of the former village survive on all sides of the parish church and manor house, most of them to the southeast. South and west of the manor house are the remains of a set of Medieval fish ponds that were fed by the river.

There are three mounds in the parish that are the sites of former windmills. One is on a hill above sea level, east of the present village and just east of the trackbed of the former railway line. Another is on Charwelton Hill, above sea level and southwest of the village beside the road to Byfield. The third is on a slight hill above sea level and about mile south of Charwelton.
The Great Central Main Line from to London Marylebone was built through the parish in the 1890s and opened in March 1899. The line crossed the river between Charwelton and Church Charwelton. Charwelton railway station was built just east of the packhorse bridge. Just south of the village were Charwelton Watertroughs. British Railways closed Charwelton station in March 1963 and the line in September 1966.

From 1917 until 1961 the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company had a quarry at Cherwell Farm northwest of Charwelton village, on the northern boundary with the parish of Hellidon. From there it ran a mineral railway down the Cherwell valley to bring ironstone to the main line at Charwelton station. A tank engine called &quot;Charwelton&quot; was built for the line in 1917, worked it until 1942, and is now preserved on the Kent and East Sussex Railway.

Charwelton had a post office in Church Street. This has now closed and been turned back into a private home.

== Amenities ==

Charwelton has a public house, the Fox and Hounds. It closed in 2012 and in September 2013 it was sold to a property company, Family Housing Ltd of Kettering. But the company gave the village until the end of October 2013 to buy it, and villagers raised enough capital to found a co-operative society, buy the Fox and Hounds and reopen it.

<text>Chapel Brampton is a village and former civil parish now in the parish of Church with Chapel Brampton, in the West Northamptonshire district, in the ceremonial county of Northamptonshire, England. Together with nearby Church Brampton, it is known as &quot;The Bramptons&quot;. At the time of the 2001 census, Chapel Brampton parish&#x27;s population was 470 people. On 1 April 2009 the parish was abolished and merged with Church Brampton to form &quot;Church with Chapel Brampton&quot;.

==Village==
The villages name means &#x27;Broom farm/settlement&#x27;.

The village is notable for its distinctive Spencer Estate cottages. These Victorian sandstone cottages are of a similar design to cottages found in the nearby villages of Church Brampton, Harlestone and The Bringtons.

Chapel Brampton has three pubs — the Spencer Arms is a former coaching inn whilst the Brampton Halt was part of the railway station. A new build on the site of the former Boughton cold store is named The Windhover after an old name for the kestrel. This site is actually within the parish of Boughton. The village has two conference centres: Sedgebrook Hall and Brampton Grange. Sedgebrook Grange was designed by architect John Brown and built in 1930 as a wedding gift for a member of the Houison Craufurd family from Craufurdland Castle in Ayrshire.

The (Red) Earl Spencer broke the neck of his favourite horse, Merry Tom, whilst out fox hunting and trying to jump the narrow River Nene. The Earl paid for a monument to be erected at the Brixworth end of what is now known as Merry Tom Lane, engraved &#x27;Here Lies the body of Merry Tom&#x27;. A local wag scratched on it: &quot;ridden to death by careless John&quot;. Merry Tom Lane was also the site of a level crossing. When the railway is rebuilt a small halt will be built there.

===Preserved railway===
The nearby railway line is now part of the preserved Northampton &amp; Lamport Railway which has its headquarters at Pitsford and Brampton railway station.

<doc id="1203012" wikidata="Q1029353" url="?curid=1203012" title="Mesosaur">
<text>Mesosaurs (&quot;middle lizards&quot;) were a group of small aquatic reptiles that lived during the early Permian period (Cisuralian), roughly 299 to 270 million years ago. Mesosaurs were the first known aquatic reptiles, having apparently returned to an aquatic lifestyle from more terrestrial ancestors. It is uncertain which and how 
many terrestrial traits these ancestors displayed; recent research cannot establish with confidence if the first amniotes were fully terrestrial, or only amphibious. Most authors consider mesosaurs to have been aquatic, although adult animals may have been amphibious, rather than completely aquatic, as indicated by their moderate skeletal adaptations to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Similarly, their affinities are uncertain; they may have been among the most basal sauropsids or among the most basal parareptiles (in the case of which parareptiles were basal sauropsids).

==Phylogeny==
The phylogenetic position of mesosaurs has an important bearing on the definition of Reptilia. In one of the first major phylogenetic studies of amniotes (vertebrates laying eggs on land) Gauthier &quot;et al.&quot; (1988) placed Mesosauridae in a group called Parareptilia. Parareptilia means &quot;at the side of reptiles&quot; and was placed outside the clade Reptilia, which was considered a crown group. As a crown group, Reptilia included the most recent common ancestor of the then believed to be the two main lineages of living reptiles – anapsids (specifically turtles) and diapsids (all other living reptiles) – and all descendants of that common ancestor. This view of placing turtles outside of diapsids is now outdated and the majority of modern paleontologists believe that the Testudines (turtles and allies) are descended from diapsid reptiles that lost their temporal fenestrae. More recent morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within diapsids, and, more commonly, as a sister taxon to Archosauria (made up of crocodiles, dinosaurs – including birds – and allies). Furthermore, Anapsida is rarely considered a valid clade in recent phylogenetic analyses. In this sense, Reptilia was a node-based taxon because the first reptilian common ancestor would have been a &quot;node&quot; on the phylogenetic tree. Under this phylogeny, many extinct forms traditionally regarded as reptiles including mesosaurs were excluded from the group because they were outside the node.


The study of Laurin and Reisz (1995) was the second major phylogenetic analysis of amniotes. Like Gauthier &quot;et al.&quot;, Laurin and Reisz used Reptilia as a crown group and placed mesosaurs outside the group. Their phylogeny differed in that the parareptiles of Gauthier &quot;et al.&quot; were now regarded as close relatives of turtles, within crown group Reptilia. Laurin and Reisz adopted the name Sauropsida as a node-based taxon including the last common ancestor of mesosaurs and Reptilia. Traditionally, amniotes are divided into two groups: a mammal lineage called Synapsida and a reptile lineage called either Reptilia or Sauropsida. In fact, the study of Gauthier (1994) defined Sauropsida as all amniotes more closely related to reptiles than to mammals, which meant that Sauropsida was a stem-based taxon encompassing the entire reptilian lineage or reptilian &quot;stem&quot; of Amniota (Synapsida was the mammalian stem). Under this phylogeny, the only group that prevents Sauropsida from being equivalent to Reptilia is mesosaurs.

More recent phylogenetic analyses, such as that of Modesto (1999), support that of Gauthier &quot;et al.&quot; (1988) by placing mesosaurs with parareptiles. However, these phylogenies follow Laurin and Reisz (1995) in placing Parareptilia within crown-group Reptilia, meaning that mesosaurs are once again members of Reptilia. Using Laurin and Reisz&#x27;s node-based definition of Sauropsida as &quot;The last common ancestor of mesosaurs, testudines and diapsids, and all its descendants&quot;, Sauropsida and Reptilia are equivalent groupings; mesosaurs and testudines are more closely related to each other than either group is to diapsids, meaning that the clade containing testudines and diapsids (which would be crown-group Reptilia) must also contain mesosaurs. Since Reptilia was named earlier than Sauropsida, it is used most often in modern phylogenetic analyses.

A 2017 phylogenetic analysis by Laurin (who had previously published the 1995 study) and Piñeiro recovered mesosaurs as a basal member of Sauropsida/Reptilia and no longer present within Parareptilia, with Parareptilia being redefined as including former members of Procolophonomorpha (found to be paraphyletic), Millerosauria, Pareiasauria, and Pantestudines, with the latter two being found to be sister groups to one another. Parareptilia was also found to actually nest inside Diapsida as the sister group to Neodiapsida.

In 2012 it was revealed that &quot;Mesosaurus&quot; has holes at the back of the skull called lower temporal fenestrae, a characteristic once thought to be present only in synapsids and diapsids. This confirmed the previous results of German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene, already published in 1941 The condition in the skull of &quot;Mesosaurus&quot; is most similar to that in synapsid skulls because both lack the upper temporal fenestrae of diapsids. Lower temporal fenestrae are so far known only in &quot;Mesosaurus&quot;, but may be present in all mesosaurs. The presence or absence of temporal fenestrae is an important consideration in the phylogeny of mesosaurs and other amniotes because the three major groups of amniotes -Synapsida, Diapsida, and Anapsida- have been named after the number of holes in their skull; Diapsida means &quot;two arches&quot; in reference to the two bars that close off the upper and lower fenestra, Synapsida means &quot;fused arch&quot; in reference to a single bar at the bottom of the skull closing a single fenestra, and Anapsida means &quot;no arch&quot; in reference to skulls that lack any bars or fenestrae. Mesosaurs were traditionally classified as anapsids because they were thought to have lacked temporal fenestrae. However, the occurrence of fenestrae in amniotes has been recognized a highly variable feature within the group for many years prior to their discovery in &quot;Mesosaurus&quot;; many anapsids such as &quot;Candelaria&quot;, &quot;Bolosaurus&quot;, and lanthanosuchoids possess lower temporal fenestrae.


The phylogenetic position of mesosaurs influences the current understanding of how amniotes evolved temporal fenestrae. If the phylogeny produced by Laurin and Reisz (1995) is correct in that mesosaurs are basal sauropsids, the lower temporal fenestra may be a primitive feature in amniotes, present in amniote&#x27;s most recent common ancestor. Synapsids would have retained their fenestrae, and so too would sauropsids except for turtles and most parareptiles. Another possibility under Laurin and Reisz&#x27;s phylogeny is that lower temporal fenestrae evolved independently in mesosaurs, synapsids, diapsids, and some parareptiles, and that the lack of fenestrae is a primitive feature in amniotes. If instead mesosaurs are members of Parareptilia, the presence of temporal fenestrae is probably not a primitive feature in amniotes, and the lower temporal fenestrae in mesosaurs may be characteristic of a lineage of basal parareptiles that also includes fenestra-bearing lanthanosuchoids and &quot;Bolosaurus&quot;.

==Biology==
They have long been thought to have been coastal forms that probably inhabited relatively shallow water, but recent research suggests that at least those from Uruguay inhabited a hypersaline environment, rather than a coastal marine environment. Recently described embryos show that pachyostosis of the ribs (which were thicker and denser than in terrestrial tetrapods) developed even before hatching, which suggests that mesosaurs were able to swim at birth, or shortly thereafter. They were apparently not very fast swimmers, with an optimal swimming speed estimated to have been between 0.15 and 0.86 m/s, but this must have been somewhat faster than the speed of their main prey, the pygocephalomorph crustaceans. Their reproductive mode is somewhat uncertain because association between adults and possible embryos in utero suggests viviparity, as in many aquatic reptiles, but a potentially isolated egg has also been found.

Recently, evidence of predation on both pygocephalomorph crustaceans and members of their own species has been established. It is thought that mesosaurs were in general adapted to hypersaline habitats.

A study on the vertebral column torso and tail proportions of &quot;Mesosaurus&quot; suggests that, while juveniles may have been fully aquatic, adults might have spent some time on land; this is further vindicated by the rarity of adult animals in aquatic settings and some faeces showing signs of drying fracture. However, how terrestrial they were is difficult to say, as this same study states that terrestrial foraging would have been difficult due to their specializations to an aquatic life.

<text>Gerard Joseph Malanga (born March 20, 1943) is an American poet, photographer, filmmaker, actor, curator and archivist. 

Malanga worked with pop artist Andy Warhol from 1963 to 1970. The New York Times referred to him as &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s most important associate. As a Warhol superstar, he appeared in a number of Warhol films. His photography spans over four decades and includes portraits, nudes and the urban documentation of &quot;New York&#x27;s Changing Scene.&quot; Malanga, who primarily is a poet, considered his portraits to be &quot;poetry on film.&quot; He has directed several films and written books. 

In 2024, Malanga was elected as a Chevalier of the &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and education ===
Malanga was born on March 20, 1943, in the Bronx, a borough of New York City, and raised on Fordham Road. He was the only child of Italian immigrant parents. His father, Gerardo Malanga, was a dry goods salesman. His early drawing ability was supported by his parents, who signed him up for an after-school art program.

In 1959, Malanga became a regular on Alan Freed&#x27;s &quot;The Big Beat&quot;, televised on Channel 5 (WNEW) in New York City. 

By his senior year, Malanga was interested in becoming a poet, but he was also studying graphic design and advertising at the School of Industrial Art in Manhattan. In 1960, he graduated from high school with a major in Advertising Design. After graduation, Malanga enrolled at the University of Cincinnati&#x27;s College of Art &amp; Design, but he dropped out within a year. 

In 1961, Malanga was admitted to Wagner College in Staten Island on a fellowship. At Wagner, Malanga became part of a writing community. He befriended one of his English professors, Willard Maas, and his wife Marie Menken, who became his mentors. He also made friends with Saul Bellow and Robert Lowell. He attended a symposium with Kay Boyle, Frank O&#x27;Hara, LeRoi Jones, and Kenneth Koch. Malanga won the first Gotham Book Mart Avant-Garde Poetry Prize. He was an editor for the journal &quot;Wagner Literary Magazine&quot;. 

===Andy Warhol and The Factory===
In 1963, Malanga was looking for a summer job when poet Charles Henri Ford introduced him pop artist Andy Warhol. Malanga had previously silkscreened fabrics for a necktie designer, and Warhol needed assistance with a silkscreening. He was immediately hired by Warhol at $1.25 per hour. &quot;The first was the Elizabeth Taylor portrait. &quot;Ethel Scull 36 Times&quot;, Elvis Presley, Death and Disasters—we put out a lot of stuff, just the two of us,&quot; Malanga recalled. In September, Malanga drove to California with Warhol, Wynn Chamberlain, and Taylor Mead for Warhol&#x27;s solo exhibition at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. He never returned to Wagner College. &quot;That summer job lasted seven years,&quot; he said.

Malanga was also involved in Warhol&#x27;s filmmaking at the Factory. He acted in the films, including &quot;Kiss&quot; (1964), &quot;Harlot&quot; (1964), &quot;Soap Opera&quot; (1964), &quot;Couch&quot; (1964), &quot;Vinyl&quot; (1965), and &quot;Camp&quot; (1965).

Malanga dated model and debutante Susan Bottomly in 1966. After introducing her to Warhol, she was given the new moniker International Velvet. Malanga and Bottomly costarred in the film &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; (1966). Malanga played a combination of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby in Warhol&#x27;s film &quot;Since&quot; (1966). 

In 1966, he choreographed a dance for Warhol&#x27;s multimedia presentation, &quot;The Exploding Plastic Inevitable&quot;, featuring musical performances by the Velvet Underground and Nico.

Malanga co-produced &quot;Bufferin&quot; (1967), in which he reads his poetry and diaries. It is deemed to be the longest spoken-word movie on record at 33-minutes nonstop.

Malanga and Warhol collaborated on the nearly 500 individual 3-minute &quot;Screen Tests&quot;, which resulted in a selection for a book of the same name, published by Kulchur Press, in 1967.

In 1969, Malanga was one of the founding editors of Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine. In 1970, he left Warhol&#x27;s studio to pursue his work in photography. 

Allegedly, Malanga created fake Warhol prints in Europe. He denied the accusations but this created a strain in their relationship. In a December 1976 diary entry, Warhol said: &quot;Ran into Gerard Malanga. Gerard wrote to Fred asking why he wouldn&#x27;t let him do photography for &quot;Interview&quot;, I guess he just wants a press pass. Fred won&#x27;t have anything to do with Gerard because we&#x27;re still getting repercussions from all the fake &quot;Electric Chairs&quot; we think he did, they&#x27;re being resold and resold and each time the money involved gets bigger, so Fred isn&#x27;t about to give Gerard anything.&quot;

=== Photography career ===
His portraits were considered by Malanga to be &quot;poetry on film.&quot; Nearly all of the major poetry magazines published his poems.

Malanga has photographed several poets and artists over the years including, Charles Olson, Iggy Pop, William Burroughs, and Herbert Gericke.

In 1973, the University of Wisconsin-Parkside Library hosted a touring exhibition featuring 110 of Malanga&#x27;s portraits.

In 1975, Malanga performed a reading of his poems and shown his film &quot;April Diary&quot; at the Sears Harkness Theater in Binghamton, New York.

In 1985, Henry J. Stern, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, appointed Malanga as the first photo archivist for the department. He was responsible for cataloguing and conserving the historic negative collection of Robert Moses.

In his introduction to Malanga&#x27;s first monograph, &quot;Resistance to Memory&quot; (Arena Editions, 1998), Ben Maddow, a photo historian and poet, said, &quot;Malanga has that great essential virtue of the photographer: humility before the complex splendor of the real thing...Malanga is the photo-historian of this culture.&quot; 

In reviewing Malanga&#x27;s book &quot;Screen Tests Portraits Nudes 1964-1996&quot; (Steidl, 2000), photographer Fred W. McDarrah remarked that &quot;Malanga is among the elite editors and photographers who have long dazzled and propelled the New York avant garde.&quot;

<text>Hard Labor Creek State Park is a 5,804 acre (23.49 km2) Georgia state park located between Bostwick and Rutledge. The park is named after Hard Labor Creek, a small stream that cuts through the park. The creek&#x27;s name comes either from enslaved people who once tilled the summer fields, or from Native Americans who found the area around the stream difficult to ford. The park plays host to an 18-hole public golf course, which offers a pro shop, driving range, rental cars, and senior citizen discounts. Rocky Creek provides many of the water hazards on the course including the 14th hole with its signature water wheel.

==General information==
Hard Labor Creek State Park is a 24-hour passable by way of paved local surface roads non-gated state park. It is the home of two group camps, Camp Rutledge and Camp Daniel Morgan, both centered on the Lake Rutledge. A second lake, Lake Brantley, occupies the northwestern area of the park. This lake was named for a Brantley family killed by Native Americans in 1813. Both the camps and the lakes were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.

Camp Daniel Morgan was the filming location of five movies, Summer of My German Soldier (1978), &quot;Little Darlings&quot; (1980), &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; (1985), &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot; (1986), and &quot;Fear Street Part 2: 1978&quot; (2021). Kristy McNichol starred in the first two. Cynthia Nixon of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; fame, who played &quot;Sunshine&quot; in &quot;Little Darlings&quot; returned to the nearby town of Rutledge, Georgia in 2005 to film a part in the Emmy winning movie &quot;Warm Springs&quot;; a part in which she too was nominated for an Emmy award.

Camp Rutledge is also the location of the long-running summer camp for the youth of Peachtree Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, Georgia, the largest Presbyterian Church (USA) in the United States. Camp Rutledge is also used by the youth of Roswell Presbyterian Church.

Hard Labor Creek State Park is the location of Hard Labor Creek Observatory; a facility of Georgia State University, Atlanta Georgia.

Camp Rutledge was leased for many years by the Atlanta Jewish Community Center during the 1950s up through 1962 as a site for its summer camp program serving Jewish youth from the Atlanta area as well as the southern United States. Its use by the AJCC was ended with the acquisition and development of Camp Barney Medintz near Cleveland, Georgia.

The Camp Rutledge facilities were featured on season 8 the show &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; which aired in 2012, and in the 2022 film &quot;They/Them&quot;.

The park was temporarily utilized as an isolation and monitoring site for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with no place to self-quarantine. Only two patients stayed at the site, before a new site was opened at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center outside of Forsyth on March 24.

The park was the special event site of the Parks on the Air, W4H &quot;Wicked 4 Halloween,&quot; activation on October 31, 2021 by the Athens Radio Club.

<doc id="1203022" wikidata="Q430518" url="?curid=1203022" title="John Hickenlooper">
<text>John Wright Hickenlooper Jr. ( ; born February 7, 1952) is an American politician, geologist, and businessman serving as the junior United States senator from Colorado since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 42nd governor of Colorado from 2011 to 2019 and as the 43rd mayor of Denver from 2003 to 2011.

Born in Narberth, Pennsylvania, Hickenlooper is a graduate of Wesleyan University. After a career as a petroleum geologist, in 1988 he co-founded the Wynkoop Brewing Company, one of the first brewpubs in the U.S. Hickenlooper was elected the 43rd mayor of Denver in 2003, serving two terms. In 2005, &quot;TIME&quot; named him one of America&#x27;s five best big-city mayors. After incumbent governor Bill Ritter said that he would not seek reelection, Hickenlooper announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination in January 2010. He won an uncontested primary and faced Constitution Party nominee Tom Tancredo and Republican Party nominee Dan Maes in the general election. Hickenlooper won with 51% of the vote and was reelected in 2014, defeating Republican Bob Beauprez.

As governor, he introduced universal background checks and banned high-capacity magazines in the wake of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, shooting. He expanded Medicaid under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, halving the rate of uninsured people in the state. Having initially opposed marijuana legalization, he has gradually come to support it.

He sought the Democratic nomination for U.S. president in 2019 but dropped out before primaries were held. He subsequently ran for the U.S. Senate, winning the Democratic nomination and the general election, defeating incumbent Republican Cory Gardner. At 68, Hickenlooper became the oldest first-term senator to represent Colorado.
== Early life, education, and career ==
Hickenlooper was born in Narberth, Pennsylvania, a middle-class area of the suburban Main Line of Philadelphia. He is the son of Anne Doughten (née Morris) Kennedy and John Wright Hickenlooper. His great-grandfather Andrew Hickenlooper was a Union general, and his grandfather Smith Hickenlooper was a United States federal judge. A cousin, Bourke B. Hickenlooper, a Republican known as &quot;Hick&quot;, was governor of Iowa from 1943 to 1945 and a U.S. senator from Iowa from 1945 to 1969.

Hickenlooper was raised by his mother from a young age after his father&#x27;s death. He is a 1970 graduate of The Haverford School, an independent boys school in Haverford, Pennsylvania, where he was a National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist. &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that at this time his heroes were Neil Young, Ray Davies, and Gordie Howe, and that his pet peeves were violence and &quot;beer boys.&quot;

Hickenlooper attended Wesleyan University, where he received a B.A. in English in 1974 and a master&#x27;s degree in geology in 1980. He recounted first smoking pot when he was 16 and using lithium carbonate capsules to go through with his final exam.

Hickenlooper worked as a geologist in Colorado for Buckhorn Petroleum in the early 1980s. When Buckhorn was sold, Hickenlooper was laid off in 1986. He and five business partners opened the Wynkoop Brewing Company brewpub in October 1988 after raising startup funds from dozens of friends and family along with a Denver economic development office loan. The Wynkoop was one of the nation&#x27;s first brewpubs. By 1996, Westword reported that Denver had more brewpubs per capita than any other city. Hickenlooper claims his restaurant was the first in Colorado to offer a designated driver program.

In 1989, Hickenlooper was arrested in Denver for &quot;driving while impaired&quot; and did community service.

== Mayor of Denver ==
In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for mayor of Denver. Campaigning on his business experience, he developed a series of creative television ads that separated him from the rest of the crowded field, including one in which he addressed unhappiness over a recent increase in parking rates by walking the streets to &quot;feed&quot; meters. He won the election and in July 2003 he took office as the 43rd mayor of Denver. &quot;TIME Magazine&quot; named him one of America&#x27;s five best big-city mayors in 2005.

On taking office, Hickenlooper inherited a &quot;$70 million budget deficit, the worst in city history&quot;, which he was able to eliminate in his first term &quot;without major service cuts or layoffs&quot;, according to &quot;Time&quot;. He won bipartisan support for a multibillion-dollar mass public transit project, intended in part to attract investment and funded by a voter-approved sales tax increase.

In 2003, Hickenlooper announced a ten-year plan to end homelessness in Denver, citing it as one of the issues that prompted him to run for mayor. 280 U.S. cities announced similar plans. The effort did not end homelessness in Denver, and in 2015 Denver&#x27;s city auditor &quot;released a scathing audit faulting the plan&#x27;s implementation.&quot; The head of the agency responsible defended the program, saying it was &quot;still housing 300-400 people a month in varying ways&quot;, while Hickenlooper argued that the point of such an ambitious target was to focus attention and resources on the problem. In his governor&#x27;s budget request for 2017–18, he asked lawmakers to allocate $12.3 million from taxes on marijuana to building homes for chronically homeless people.

Hickenlooper established the Denver Scholarship Foundation, providing needs-based college scholarships to high school graduates.

In May 2007, Hickenlooper was reelected with 88% of the vote. He resigned as mayor just before his inauguration as governor.

=== 2008 Democratic National Convention ===

Hickenlooper was an executive member of the Denver 2008 Convention Host Committee and helped lead the successful campaign for Denver to host the 2008 Democratic National Convention, which was also the centennial anniversary of the city&#x27;s hosting of the 1908 Democratic National Convention.

In a controversial move decried by critics as breaching partisan ethics, the Hickenlooper administration arranged for the DNC host committee, a private nonprofit organization, to get untaxed fuel from Denver city-owned pumps, saving them . Once the arrangement came to light, the host committee agreed to pay taxes on the fuel already consumed and on all future fuel purchases. Also, Coors Brewing Company, based in Golden, Colorado, used &quot;waste beer&quot; to provide the ethanol to power a fleet of FlexFuel vehicles used during the convention.

== Governor of Colorado ==
=== Elections ===
==== 2010 ====

Hickenlooper was viewed as a possible contender for governor of Colorado in the November 2006 election to replace term-limited Republican governor Bill Owens. Despite a &quot;Draft Hick&quot; campaign, he announced on February 6, 2006, that he would not run for governor. Later, he supported Democratic candidate Bill Ritter, Denver&#x27;s former district attorney, who was subsequently elected.

After Ritter announced on January 6, 2010, that he would step down at the end of his term, Hickenlooper was cited as a potential candidate for governor. He said that if Salazar mounted a bid for governor, he would likely not challenge him in a Democratic primary. On January 7, 2010, Salazar confirmed that he would not run for governor in 2010 and endorsed Hickenlooper. On January 12, 2010, media outlets reported that Hickenlooper would begin a campaign for governor. On August 5, 2010, he selected CSU-Pueblo president Joseph A. Garcia as his running mate. Hickenlooper was elected with 51% of the vote, ahead of former congressman Tom Tancredo, running on the American Constitution Party ticket, who finished with 36.4% of the vote.

==== 2014 ====

Hickenlooper won a tightly contested gubernatorial election by 68,238 votes against Republican businessman and former congressman Bob Beauprez.

=== Tenure ===
On January 11, 2011, Hickenlooper was sworn in as the 42nd governor of Colorado after winning by 15 points. He was the second Denver mayor ever elected governor. His victory was a landslide despite Democrats&#x27; poor results overall in the 2010 elections. Republicans flipped twelve governorships nationwide in 2010. NPR described Hickenlooper as having a &quot;pro-business centrist profile&quot; and as &quot;known to try to build consensus and compromise on tough issues&quot;, while &quot;5280&quot; called him as &quot;one of those unicorn-rare, truly apolitical politicians&quot;, noting support from business leaders and some Republicans.

On December 4, 2012, Hickenlooper was elected to serve as vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association.

On August 25, 2017, it was reported that Republican Governor of Ohio John Kasich was considering the possibility of a 2020 unity ticket to run against Donald Trump, with Hickenlooper as vice president.

Constitutionally limited to two consecutive terms, Hickenlooper could not run for governor in 2018.

On June 5, 2020, the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission fined Hickenlooper $2,750 for twice violating Colorado&#x27;s gift ban as governor. Hickenlooper received a flight on a private jet owned by homebuilder and donor Larry Mizel, the founder of MDC Holdings. He also received private security and a ride to the airport in a Maserati limousine on a trip to the Bilderberg Meetings in Italy. The state spent an estimated $127,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees investigating the violation.

== U.S. Senate ==

=== Elections ===

==== 2020 ====

Hickenlooper had previously been considered the front-runner to fill the United States Senate seat to be vacated by Ken Salazar upon his confirmation as Secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration. He confirmed his interest in the seat. But on January 3, 2009, Governor Bill Ritter appointed Denver Public Schools Superintendent Michael Bennet to the position. Bennet previously served as Hickenlooper&#x27;s chief of staff.

In a YouTube video published to his campaign channel on August 22, 2019, Hickenlooper announced that he would run for the United States Senate in 2020. Some preliminary polling data showed him with a substantial lead against incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Cory Gardner. Hickenlooper was also leading the Democratic primary field by a fairly wide margin before he announced. He was quickly endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a move protested by candidates already running before Hickenlooper&#x27;s entry.

On June 30, Hickenlooper defeated former state house Speaker Andrew Romanoff in the Democratic primary, winning the nomination to challenge one-term incumbent Republican Cory Gardner. He defeated Gardner by 9 points and took office on January 3, 2021.

=== Tenure ===

==== January 6 Capitol attack ====
In the wake of the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, Hickenlooper said he would support efforts to remove Donald Trump from office, in line with most of his party.

==== STOCK Act violations ====
In May 2022, an analysis by the nonprofit news organization Sludge found that Hickenlooper had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 by failing to disclose within 45 days five stock trades his household made, which were worth between $565,000 and $1.3 million.

In June 2022, an analysis by Business Insider found that Hickenlooper had again violated the STOCK Act by disclosing stock trades made by his wife between two and 14 months later than required by law, including purchases worth between $516,006 and $1.2 million and sales worth between $130,004 and $300,000.

== 2020 presidential campaign ==


On March 4, 2019, Hickenlooper announced his campaign to seek the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2020. His candidacy had been a matter of media speculation for months before his announcement. Hickenlooper formally launched his campaign on March 7, 2019, in Denver, Colorado. A video titled &quot;Stand Tall&quot; was released to announce the campaign and outline his reasons for running. Hickenlooper formed Giddy Up PAC in 2018 in anticipation of a presidential campaign, raising more than $600,000 in the midterm cycle. The campaign struggled to gain traction in the crowded and increasingly competitive Democratic presidential primary field, and Hickenlooper ended his candidacy in a YouTube video on August 15, 2019, and instead began exploring a run for the U.S. Senate.

== Political positions ==
=== Capital punishment ===
In 2013, a campaign sought clemency for Nathan Dunlap, a black man facing execution for the 1993 murder of four people, with three former jurors saying they would not have voted for the death penalty had they known of his undiagnosed mental illness, while the mother of a victim, a former co-worker of Dunlap, and the Arapahoe County District Attorney urged Hickenlooper to let the execution take place. Hickenlooper granted Dunlap a reprieve, reversible by a future governor, citing inequity in the legal system and the evidence against capital punishment&#x27;s effectiveness as a deterrent, saying, &quot;It is a legitimate question whether we as a state should be taking lives&quot;.

In Hickenlooper&#x27;s 2016 memoir, he came out against the death penalty, saying his views had changed after he became more familiar with the research showing bias against minorities and people with mental illnesses.

=== Disaster recovery ===
In May 2014, Hickenlooper signed five bills related to disaster relief in the wake of flooding and wildfires. The bills funded grants to remove flood debris from watersheds and to repair flood-damaged schools and damaged wastewater and drinking water systems. They also exempted people who lost homes from having to pay property taxes and out-of-state disaster workers from having to pay Colorado state income tax.

=== Drug policy ===
In 2005, Denver voted to legalize possession of small amounts of cannabis, becoming the first major U.S. city to do so. Hickenlooper opposed the initiative as mayor, calling marijuana a gateway drug and saying that the initiative would not prevent enforcement of state law prohibiting cannabis. As governor in 2012, he opposed Amendment 64, which made Colorado the first state along with Washington to allow the sale and recreational use of cannabis. Hickenlooper said the initiative &quot;sends the wrong message to kids that drugs are OK&quot; and that &quot;federal authorities have been clear they will not turn a blind eye toward states attempting to trump those laws&quot;. Despite his opposition, he worked with the state legislature to implement the initiative after it passed, and a federal crackdown on sale of the drug never materialized.

As Colorado&#x27;s new laws were implemented and the results became clearer, Hickenlooper&#x27;s views evolved. In 2016, he said that Colorado&#x27;s approach to cannabis legalization was &quot;beginning to look like it might work&quot;. In 2019, he said that &quot;the things that I feared six years ago have not come to pass&quot; and that he would be happy to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level if he became president. He also said that the federal government should not stop states from decriminalizing illicit drugs beyond marijuana, as well as allowing for safe, supervised injection sites. In 2022 he introduced the PREPARE Act, to direct the attorney general to develop a regulatory framework for cannabis similar to alcohol, in preparation for federal legalization of the drug.

=== Economic policy ===
In March 2014, Hickenlooper signed House Bill 1241, which funded the Rural Economic Development Initiative (REDI).

In 2016, Hickenlooper launched a program called Skillful, with the help of LinkedIn and the Markle Foundation. The program uses online tools and on-the-ground advisors to help businesses create job descriptions to tap into a wider job pool and help job seekers fill high-need jobs and connect them with job training. Twenty other states are now following. In 2017, Skillful added the Governors Coaching Corps. program, a career coaching initiative operated out of workforce center, community colleges, and nonprofits, with the help of a $25.8 million grant from Microsoft.

Hickenlooper calls himself &quot;a fiscal conservative.&quot; He has said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the government needs to be bigger. I think the government&#x27;s got to work, and people have got to believe in government, and I think that&#x27;s part of the problem,&quot; and &quot;I think what a lot of Americans want is better government, not bigger government.&quot;

=== Energy and environment ===
Hickenlooper&#x27;s administration created the first methane-capture regulations for oil and gas companies in the entire country. The rules prevented 95% of volatile organic compounds and methane from leaking from hydraulic fracturing wells. The rules were later used as blueprints for California, Canada, and the federal government&#x27;s own new rules.

After Trump announced that the United States would leave the Paris Climate Accord, Hickenlooper joined more than a dozen other states in retaining the accord&#x27;s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.

NPR has called Hickenlooper a &quot;strong supporter of Colorado&#x27;s oil and gas industry&quot;. Unlike most Democrats, he supports hydraulic fracking, a controversial oil and natural gas extraction process. Before politics, Hickenlooper was a geologist. He believes fracking is a beneficial practice with minimal environmental harm, even testifying in a 2013 hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources that he had drunk a glass of fracking fluid produced by Halliburton.

In February 2021, Hickenlooper was one of seven Democratic U.S. senators to join Republicans in blocking a ban of hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking.

In September 2023, Hickenlooper introduced the BIG WIRES Act in the United States Senate as S. 2827 alongside Representative Scott Peters, who introduced it in the House of Representatives. The bill&#x27;s provisions direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to &quot;establish minimum interregional transfer capabilities&quot;, better coordinating construction of electrical transmission lines. The bill is part of broader push to accelerate permitting for clean energy.

=== Gun policy ===
Exactly eight months after the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, Hickenlooper signed bills into law requiring universal background checks on all gun transfers in Colorado except gifts between immediate family members, and banning magazines with more than 15 rounds. Although most Coloradans supported the measures, according to polling by the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, the bills&#x27; opponents gathered enough signatures to trigger special elections leading to the ousting of Democratic state senators John Morse and Angela Giron and the resignation of Evie Hudak.

Hickenlooper was a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns until 2011. In 2018, he supported a Red Flag or Extreme Risk Protection Order Bill in the legislature that would have allowed judges to temporally restrict firearm access to those deemed a significant risk to themselves or others. The GOP-controlled State Senate never let the bill out of committee that legislative session.

=== Healthcare and abortion ===
Hickenlooper expanded Medicaid and established Colorado&#x27;s health insurance marketplace, Connect for Health Colorado, through the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The state&#x27;s uninsured rate dropped from 14.3% in 2013 to 6.5% in 2017. Approximately 350,000 Coloradans, about a quarter of whom are undocumented immigrants and thus ineligible for public insurance, remained without insurance coverage. The price of health insurance coverage continued to rise in Colorado, which has some of the highest premiums in the nation.

Hickenlooper is pro-choice on abortion rights. After &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was overturned in June 2022, he said the decision &quot;threatens not just a woman’s physical health &amp; control over her own future, but it also threatens to put women &amp; their doctors in jail&quot;, and that &quot;Republicans should join Democrats today and vote to keep politics out of reproductive health care decisions.&quot;

=== Immigration ===
As governor, Hickenlooper signed legislation granting in-state tuition to Dreamers (DACA) and joined a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from ending DACA. During his 2019 campaign for President, Hickenlooper described the Trump administration family separation policy as ″kidnapping″ and said it would be ″crazy″ to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Hickenlooper voted against providing economic support to undocumented immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic on February 4, 2021.

=== Sex work ===

In March 2019, Hickenlooper said he supported legalizing sex work and regulating &quot;where there are norms and protections&quot;.

=== Tech issues and cryptocurrency ===
During his 2020 presidential campaign, Hickenlooper voiced concern about potential monopolistic activity in the tech sector, and identified Amazon and Google as potentially hindering competition. His platform called for revamping the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 to clamp down on anti-competitive behavior.

As governor, Hickenlooper set up a Council for the Advancement of Blockchain Technology to coordinate Colorado&#x27;s approach to blockchain policy.

Hickenlooper&#x27;s first wife, Helen Thorpe, is a writer whose work has been published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;George&quot;, and &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;. Before they separated, they lived in Denver&#x27;s Park Hill neighborhood with their son, Teddy. Upon taking office as governor, Hickenlooper and his family decided to maintain their private residence instead of moving to the Colorado Governor&#x27;s Mansion. On July 31, 2012, Hickenlooper announced that he and Thorpe were divorcing after 10 years of marriage. After the divorce, Hickenlooper moved into the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Hickenlooper married Robin Pringle on January 16, 2016. Pringle and Hickenlooper welcomed a baby boy via surrogate in December 2022.

=== Family background ===
Hickenlooper is of partial Dutch descent. His mother&#x27;s family were practicing Quakers. He spent a summer in his teens volunteering with the American Friends Service Committee in Robbinston, Maine, helping establish a volunteer-run free school. In 2010, Hickenlooper told &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; that he and Thorpe attended Quaker meetings and tried to live by Quaker values. In a 2018 speech to the Economic Club of Chicago, Hickenlooper said &quot;I&#x27;m not a Quaker&quot;, but spoke about the role of Quaker teaching in his approach to government.

A cousin, George Hickenlooper (1963–2010) was an Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker. He is the great-grandson of Civil War Brivet Brigadier General Andrew Hickenlooper and the grandson of federal judge Smith Hickenlooper. Other relatives include pianist Olga Samaroff (née Lucy Mary Olga Agnes Hickenlooper), the first wife of conductor Leopold Stokowski, and great-uncle Bourke Hickenlooper, who served as governor of Iowa and a U.S. senator from Iowa.

Writer Kurt Vonnegut was a friend of Hickenlooper&#x27;s father. Meeting later in life, Vonnegut offered advice that came to guide Hickenlooper&#x27;s life: &quot;Be very careful who you pretend to be, because that&#x27;s who you&#x27;re going to be.&quot; In his 2016 memoir, Hickenlooper mentioned that he watched the 1972 pornographic movie &quot;Deep Throat&quot; with his mother alongside one of his friends. He later recounted the event during his 2020 presidential campaign.

Hickenlooper is an avid squash player and continues to compete as a ranked player in national tournaments. As of 2019, Hickenlooper&#x27;s net worth was more than $8 million.

=== Health ===
Hickenlooper lives with prosopagnosia, commonly known as &quot;face blindness&quot;.

<text>Carphone Warehouse is a mobile phone retailer based in London, United Kingdom. In August 2014 the company became a subsidiary of Currys plc (previously named &quot;Dixons Carphone&quot;), which was formed by the merger of its former parent Carphone Warehouse Group with Dixons Retail. Prior to this merger, Carphone Warehouse Group was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. Following the closure of all stand-alone UK stores in April 2020, all remaining Carphone Warehouse UK outlets were within branches of Currys PC World. In April 2021, the Carphone Warehouse business in Ireland (including all stand-alone and co-located branches and the website) was closed with immediate effect. Currys continued to use the Carphone Warehouse brand in the United Kingdom, online and, until 2021, inside Currys stores.

==History==
===Early years===
The company was co-founded in 1989 by Sir Charles Dunstone and Julian Brownlie, who put £6,000 into the company from their savings. Guy Johnson of NEC UK became the second partner at the company, later taking up the role of Logistics and Distribution director. In 1990, Dunstone brought in his school friend David Ross, a chartered accountant, who became Chief Operating Officer in the same year.

===1999 to 2009===
In January 1999, the company bought Tandy&#x27;s operations in the United Kingdom for £9 million. In July 2000, Carphone Warehouse issued an IPO. In July 2001, Johnson sold the majority of his stake and retired. Carphone Warehouse bought Opal Telecom in November 2002.

In 2003, Ross started to step down from the COO role. In July 2005, he became deputy chairman. On 10 October 2006, the Carphone Warehouse announced that it would purchase the Internet access business of AOL in the United Kingdom for £370m. Also in that month, it was announced that Geek Squad would be launching in the United Kingdom, in a 50/50 joint venture between Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy.

In May 2008, Best Buy agreed to buy a 50% share in Carphone Warehouse&#x27;s retail business for £1.1 billion, to launch the Best Buy Europe joint venture, named CPW Europe. Best Buy and Carphone Warehouse also opened joint venture stores in the United States.

Ross, by now a non-executive director, resigned from the board in December 2008.

=== 2010 to 2021 ===
In 2010, the broadband and home phone business was spun off as TalkTalk.

In May 2014, Carphone Warehouse Group and Dixons Retail announced their merger to create Dixons Carphone. The merger completed on 7 August 2014. The Dixons Group staff moved into 1 Portal Way, the original home of Carphone Warehouse in West London, in May 2015.

In May 2015, Carphone Warehouse launched iD Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator using Three&#x27;s network.

In April 2020, products and services from the O2 network ceased to be available from Carphone Warehouse after the companies were unable to reach a contractual agreement.

====Closure of stand-alone UK stores====
In March 2020, the company announced that they would be closing all 531 stand-alone UK stores the following month, with sales operations continuing within co-located &quot;shops within shops&quot; at Currys PC World stores and through the website. It was said that this measure was a result of the changing mobile market.

====Closure in Ireland====
On 21 April 2021, the company announced that the entire business in Ireland, including all 69 standalone stores in Ireland, 12 outlets within other stores, and the carphonewarehouse.ie website would close with immediate effect, with the loss of 486 jobs. The company stated the closures were in line with the decision to close all UK stores the previous year, with the changes in the mobile market and customer shopping behaviour being accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Owner Dixons Carphone noted that it would continue to sell phones and accessories in Ireland through Currys PC World stores and the Currys website.

===Demergers and disposals===
On 8 May 2009, Carphone Warehouse agreed to pay £236m in cash for the United Kingdom assets of Tiscali, an Italian telecoms group. Tiscali UK later became part of TalkTalk.

In March 2010, TalkTalk and Carphone Warehouse split and Dido Harding became CEO of TalkTalk, and Roger Taylor CEO of New Carphone Warehouse. Dunstone remained Chairman of both companies. On 30 April 2013, Carphone Warehouse agreed to purchase Best Buy&#x27;s 50% stake in Best Buy Europe for £500 million.

Carphone Warehouse owned 46% of Virgin Mobile France in a joint venture with Virgin Group. In June 2014, Carphone and Virgin agreed to sell Virgin Mobile France to Numericable for €325 million. French competition regulators, ARCEP, approved the deal in November 2014.

==Data protection issues==
During April 2005, customers who bought mobile phones from Carphone Warehouse retail outlets alleged that their landline accounts were subsequently switched without their consent.

On 15 August 2006, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office issued Preliminary Enforcement Notices for breaches of PECR (The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations) against Carphone Warehouse and TalkTalk for making marketing calls to people who were signed up to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) or people who had asked that the company make no further calls to them. On 28 October 2006, in an interview in &quot;The Times&quot;, Richard Thomas, Britain&#x27;s Information Commissioner, stated:

We&#x27;re taking action against some of the telecom companies, Talk Talk and Carphone Warehouse. We&#x27;re taking action against them because we&#x27;ve had a lot of complaints that they&#x27;ve been telephoning people with marketing calls, people whose name is on the telephone preference service. And then we do these prosecutions, particularly with private detectives. We&#x27;ve got a big case coming up.

On 5 August 2015, hackers gained access to customer data for 2.4 million people who had used sites operated by Carphone Warehouse, including OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com, Mobiles.co.uk and TalkTalk Group.

In January 2018, the company was fined £400,000 by the ICO for &quot;multiple inadequacies&quot; in Carphone&#x27;s security processes, including using old software and failing to carry out routine security testing. Intruders were able to access personal information, including the names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital status and, in more than 18,000 cases, historical payment card details of customers of Carphone Warehouse.

== Marketing and sponsorship ==
===&quot;The X Factor&quot;===
On 19 June 2007, Carphone Warehouse became the official sponsor of the fourth series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. The sponsorship deal was to last for three years. Carphone Warehouse also became the sponsor of its spin off show, &quot;The Xtra Factor&quot;. After Carphone Warehouse and TalkTalk split, TalkTalk took over the sole sponsorship of &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

===&quot;Big Brother&quot;===
The company were the sponsors for the United Kingdom&#x27;s version of &quot;Big Brother&quot; from 2004 to 2007. In 2006, they also sponsored &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and related &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; shows on Channel 4.

On 17 January 2007, in response to alleged racism in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, Charles Dunstone said: &quot;We are talking to Channel 4. The sponsorship is constantly under review. Clearly we are against racism. Most people understand that the person who has their name associated with the programme does not necessarily condone the content.&quot;

On 18 January 2007, Carphone Warehouse announced that it had suspended its sponsorship of the show as Channel 4 had not taken sufficient action in response to the alleged racism in the show. On 8 March 2007, the company permanently dropped its sponsorship of the show.

===Appy Awards===
In April 2011, Carphone Warehouse sponsored the Appy Awards, calling them &quot;the United Kingdom’s first major app awards ceremony designed to recognise innovation and development in app technology&quot;.

==Charity support==
In October 2001, Carphone Warehouse established a corporate partnership with Get Connected UK, a confidential helpline service for young people, that continues today as &quot;The Mix&quot;. Carphone Warehouse supplies Get Connected with office and helpline equipment and has been instrumental in ensuring it is free to call from all landlines and mobiles. This partnership won the &quot;Charity Times&quot; Corporate Partnership Award in 2003 and the &quot;Third Sector&quot; Excellence Award for Corporate Partnership in 2006.

<doc id="1203027" wikidata="Q794661" url="?curid=1203027" title="Q and R-class destroyer">
<text>The Q and R class was a class of sixteen War Emergency Programme destroyers ordered for the British Royal Navy in 1940 as the 3rd and 4th Emergency Flotilla. They served as convoy escorts during World War II. Three Q-class ships were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy upon completion, with two further ships being handed over in 1945. &quot;Roebuck&quot; had the dubious honour of being launched prematurely by an air raid at Scotts shipyard in Greenock, her partially complete hulk lying submerged in the dockyard for nine months before it was salvaged and completed.

==Design==
The Q and R class were repeats of the preceding , but reverted to the larger J-, K- and N-class hull to allow for the inevitable growth in topweight. As they had fewer main guns than the J, K and Ns, some magazine space was replaced by fuel bunkers, allowing some to be made at , rather than the of their predecessors. Like the O and Ps, they were armed with what weapons were available: guns on single mountings that allowed only 40° elevation, which do not compare favourably on paper with many contemporaries. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer.

In the Q class, &#x27;Y&#x27; gun could be removed, allowing additional depth charges and projectors, or minesweeps, to be carried.

The R class were repeats of the Qs, except that the officers&#x27; accommodation was moved from its traditional location right aft to the more accessible location amidships. This facilitated the change in watchkeepers in inclement weather; the main deck of a destroyer would often be entirely awash in heavy seas, and catwalks were not fitted to connect fore and aft until the V class ordered in 1941.

In surviving ships, the single 20 mm Oerlikon guns in the bridge wings were later replaced by hydraulically operated Mark V twin mountings. &quot;Rotherham&quot;, &quot;Raider&quot; and &quot;Rocket&quot; later had the Oerlikons and searchlight amidships replaced by four single QF 40 mm Bofors. The searchlight was later reinstated at the cost of depth charge stowage. &quot;Raider&quot; only had an additional pair of twin Mark V Oerlikon mounts added on the after shelter deck. Radar Type 290 was replaced by Type 291, and later by Type 293 in some ships. The centimetric wavelength Type 272 set was added on a platform between the torpedo tubes in &quot;Rotherham&quot;, &quot;Racehorse&quot;, &quot;Rapid&quot;, &quot;Raider&quot; and &quot;Roebuck&quot;, or at the foremast truck in other ships. &quot;Racehorse&quot;, &quot;Raider&quot;, &quot;Rapid&quot;, &quot;Redoubt&quot; and &quot;Relentless&quot; had Huff-Duff (High-frequency Direction-finder) added on a lattice mainmast.

<text>The Tukituki River is in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region of the eastern North Island of New Zealand. It flows from the Ruahine Ranges to the Pacific Ocean at the southern end of Hawke Bay.

The river flows for , east and then northeast, passing through the town of Waipukurau before flowing into Hawke Bay, close to the city of Hastings. There, the Tukituki Valley is separated from Havelock North and Hastings by the craggy range of hills that includes Te Mata Peak.

==Etymology==
The Māori name Tukituki roughly translates &quot;to demolish&quot;, presumably referring to the power of the river in flood. Māori legend has it that there are two taniwha living in lake at the southern end of the river that fought over a young boy after he fell into the lake. The struggle of the two taniwha was thought to split the river into the Waipawa and Tukituki Rivers and thereby draining the lake.

<doc id="1203041" wikidata="Q125142" url="?curid=1203041" title="Tūī">
<text>The tūī (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) is a medium-sized bird native to New Zealand. It is blue, green, and bronze coloured with a distinctive white throat tuft (poi). It is an endemic passerine bird of New Zealand, and the only species in the genus Prosthemadera. It is one of the largest species in the diverse Australasian honeyeater family Meliphagidae, and one of two living species of that family found in New Zealand, the other being the New Zealand bellbird (&quot;Anthornis melanura&quot;). The tūī has a wide distribution in the archipelago, ranging from the subtropical Kermadec Islands to the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, as well as the main islands.

== Taxonomy ==
Europeans first encountered the tūī in 1770 at Queen Charlotte Sound on the north coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island during Captain James Cook&#x27;s first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Specimens were brought back to England and an engraving of a tūī by the English naturalist Peter Brown, which he called &quot;The New Zeland creeper&quot;, was published in 1776. The tūī was seen on all three of Cook&#x27;s voyages. Cook&#x27;s account of his second voyage to the Pacific was published in 1777 and included a description and an illustration of the tūī. He used the names &quot;poly-bird&quot; and &quot;poe-bird&quot;. He praised the bird: &quot;The flesh is most delicious, and was the greatest luxury the woods afforded us.&quot; In 1782 the English ornithologist John Latham included the tūī as the &quot;poë bee-eater&quot; in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham described a specimen in the Leverian Museum in London. No author had introduced a scientific name, but when in 1788 the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, he included the tūī with a short description, coined the binomial name &quot;Merops novaeseelandiae&quot; and cited the publications by Brown, Cook and Latham. The tūī is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Prosthemadera&quot; that was introduced in 1840 by the English zoologist George Gray. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;prosthema&quot; meaning &quot;appendage&quot; with &quot;dera&quot; meaning &quot;neck&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. n. novaeseelandiae&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – North, South, Stewart and satellites, Kermadec Islands (northeast of North Island) and Auckland Islands (south of South Island; New Zealand)
* &quot;P. n. chathamensis&quot; Hartert, EJO, 1928 – Chatham Islands (east of South Island, New Zealand)

The bird&#x27;s name comes from the Māori language. The plural is &quot;tūī&quot; in modern New Zealand English, or &quot;ngā tūī&quot; in Māori usage; some speakers still use the &#x27;-s&#x27; suffix to produce the Anglicised form &quot;tūīs&quot; to indicate plurality, but this practice is becoming less common. For many years the prevailing spelling was &quot;tui&quot; without the macrons that indicate long vowels, but spelling Māori loanwords with macrons is now common in New Zealand English. The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC), which has a policy of not using accents, lists &quot;Tui&quot; as the bird&#x27;s English name. Early European colonists called it the &quot;parson bird&quot; or &quot;mocking-bird&quot; but these names are no longer used. 

The closest living relative to tūī is the New Zealand bellbird; genetic analysis indicates its ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the New Zealand and Chatham bellbirds around 5 million years ago. The cladogram below shows this relationship:

== Description ==
The tūī is a large honeyeater, in length. The Chatham Islands subspecies is larger on average than the nominate subspecies, and heavier. Males tend to be heavier than females. Nominate males weigh between , and females . Males of the Chatham subspecies are and females .

At first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its neck and a small white wing patch, causing it to resemble a parson in clerical attire. On closer inspection (see image) it can be seen that tūī have brown feathers on the back and flanks, a multicoloured iridescent sheen that varies with the angle from which the light strikes them, and a dusting of small, white-shafted feathers on the back and sides of the neck that produce a lacy collar.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Tūī are native to New Zealand, and are found throughout the country, particularly the North Island, the west and south coasts of the South Island, Stewart Island / Rakiura and the Chatham Islands, where an endangered sub-species particular to these islands exists. Other populations live on Raoul Island in the Kermadecs, and in the Auckland Islands (where, with the New Zealand bellbird, it is the most southerly species of honeyeater). Traditionally, Māori ate tūī that had been preserved in calabashes or gourds. Populations have declined considerably since European settlement, mainly as a result of widespread habitat destruction and predation by mammalian invasive species.

Nonetheless, the species is considered secure and has made recoveries in some areas, particularly after removal of livestock has allowed vegetation to recover. Predation by introduced species remains a threat, particularly brushtail possums (which eat eggs and chicks), cats, stoats, the common myna (which competes with tūī for food and sometimes takes eggs), blackbirds, and rats.

Tūī prefer broadleaf forests at low altitudes, although have been recorded up to 1500 metres. They will tolerate quite small remnant patches, regrowth, exotic plantations and well-vegetated suburbs. They are one of the most common birds found in urban Wellington. Tūī are usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family groups, but will congregate in large numbers at suitable food sources, often in company with silvereyes, bellbirds, or kererū (New Zealand pigeon) in any combination. Generally, when interspecific competition for the same food resources among New Zealand&#x27;s two species of honeyeater occurs, there is a hierarchy with the tūī at the top and bellbirds subordinate. The latter are thus frequently chased off by tūī at a food source such as a flowering flax plant.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Male tūī can be extremely aggressive, chasing all other birds (large and small) from their territory with loud flapping and sounds akin to rude human speech. This is especially true of other tūī when possession of a favoured feeding tree is impinged. Birds will often erect their body feathers in order to appear larger in an attempt to intimidate a rival. They have even been known to mob harriers and magpies.

The powered flight of tūī is quite loud as they have developed short wide wings, giving excellent maneuverability in the dense forest they prefer, but requiring rapid flapping. They can be seen to perform a mating display of rising at speed in a vertical climb in clear air, before stalling and dropping into a powered dive, then repeating. Much of this behaviour is more notable during the breeding season of early spring—September and October. Females alone build nests of twigs, grasses and mosses.

=== Feeding ===

Nectar is the normal diet but fruit and insects are frequently eaten, and pollen and seeds more occasionally. Particularly popular is the New Zealand flax, whose nectar sometimes ferments, resulting in the tūī flying in a fashion that suggests that they might be drunk. They are the main pollinators of flax, kōwhai, kaka beak and some other plants. Note that the flowers of the three plants mentioned are similar in shape to the tūī&#x27;s beak—a vivid example of mutualistic coevolution.

===Breeding===
The large untidy shallow cup-shaped nest is built by both sexes, but the female does most of the work. The eggs usually have a pale pink or white background with blotches of pale red mostly at the larger end. The clutch is usually 4 eggs and the average size of an eggs is . The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 14 days. Both sexes feed the young and remove the faecal sacs. The chicks fledge after around 20 days. The parents continue to feed the fledglings for another couple of weeks. The birds are nidicolous.

=== Songs and calls ===
Tūī are known for their noisy, unusual, sometimes soulful calls, different for each individual, that combine bellbird-like notes with clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks and groans, and wheezing sounds. 

Tūī have a complex variety of songs and calls, much like parrots. They also resemble parrots in their ability to clearly imitate human speech, and were trained by Māori to replicate complex speech. They also re-create sounds like glass shattering, car alarms, classical music and advertising jingles.

All birds have a sound producing organ called a syrinx, which is typically controlled with two sets of muscles. Songbirds or passerines like tūī have nine pairs of muscles giving them the ability to produce much more complex vocalisations, and they can be seen to be very physically involved with their songs. Their dual voice box allow tūī to make two sounds at the same time. Tūī song also exhibits geographical, microgeographic, seasonal, sex and individual variation. Tūī will also sing at night, especially around the full moon period.

<doc id="1203042" wikidata="Q6126219" url="?curid=1203042" title="Robert J. Frankel">
<text>Robert Julian Frankel (July 9, 1941 – November 16, 2009) was an American thoroughbred race horse trainer whom ESPN called &quot;one of the most successful and respected trainers in the history of thoroughbred racing.&quot; He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1995, and was a five-time winner of the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Trainer. Often referred to as &quot;Bobby&quot; by others, he preferred and always used &quot;Robert&quot;. Frankel set the single-season world record for most Grade/Group I victories in 2003 with 25 Grade I wins, a record that stood until it was beaten by Aidan O&#x27;Brien in 2017.

==Early life and education==
Frankel was born July 9, 1941, to a German-Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Merrill and Gertrude Frankel. His parents were in the catering business. His interest in horses was piqued when his parents took him to Belmont Park as a child. After high school, he enrolled at C.W. Post College on Long Island but soon quit after getting into a fight. Thereafter, he worked construction by day and gambled at the tracks by night, eventually volunteering as a hot walker so he could get a free pass to the evening races.

==Career==
Early in his career in 1960s New York City, Frankel assisted the prominent trainer Buddy Jacobson. On his own, Frankel saddled his first winner late in 1966 before struggling somewhat in 1967, when he won with just 9 of 101 starters. During 1968 however, he won 36 of 165 outings with his horses accumulating $167,000 in purse money. In the next few years, he continued to prosper in New York and during the winter of 1970–71, he enjoyed some success at the West Coast meeting at Santa Anita.

After moving permanently to California in 1972, Frankel scored a series of wins that brought him to the attention of the horse-betting world, winning a record 60 races at Hollywood Park. Many of those victories came with runners he acquired as low-cost claimers for one of his owners like Edmund Gann, with whom he had a 30-year working relationship. These horses typically showed dramatic improvement under his care, sometimes winning their next start against higher-priced claiming levels.

Frankel was an avid follower of the training techniques of Charlie Whittingham, trainer of champions such as Ferdinand and Sunday Silence. Frankel won several Eclipse Awards, the year-end thoroughbred racing awards, for best trainer. He set earnings records, Grade I stakes victory records, and many others. Frankel also won the Pacific Classic Stakes a record six times, including four times in a row, also a record.

Some of his best race horses include: Squirtle Squirt, his first Breeders&#x27; Cup winner; Skimming, two-time winner of the Grade 1 Pacific Classic Stakes; Sightseek, winner of the Humana Distaff Handicap (Gr. I) and Ogden Phipps Handicap (Gr. I); triple Grade I winner Empire Maker, winner of the Belmont Stakes (Gr. I); multiple Grade I winning Peace Rules; two-time Santa Anita Handicap (Gr. I) winner Milwaukee Brew; Breeders&#x27; Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf (Gr. I) winner Starine, whom he also owned; and Ghostzapper, the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic (Gr. I) winner who was voted the 2004 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year.

Frankel was the U.S. Champion Trainer by earnings in 2002 and 2003.

On June 26, 2005, Wild Desert, owned by several businesspeople including former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, gave Frankel his first victory in the $1 million Queen&#x27;s Plate, the first leg of the Canadian Triple Crown at Woodbine Racetrack.

==Personal life and death==
Frankel was married twice.

His first wife was Bernadette Birk (1950-2024) Birk was a Roman Catholic of Welsh descent who converted to Judaism when they married. In 1970 they had one daughter, Bethenny Frankel, who later went on to become a reality television personality and businesswoman. They divorced after four years of marriage, and Bernadette married horse trainer John Parisella. Parisella and Frankel were originally friends as well as competitors.

In 2003, he married Bonita Boniface. They divorced in 2006.

Frankel died at his home in Pacific Palisades, California on November 16, 2009, at the age of 68, after being diagnosed with leukemia. Estranged from his daughter and once good friend (and step-father to Bethenny) Parisella, he reconciled with both before his death. He is interred at Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City, California.

==Legacy==
On November 1, 2014, Bobby&#x27;s Kitten, named after the late Hall of Fame trainer, captured the Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf Sprint at Santa Anita Park. Bobby&#x27;s Kitten is owned and bred by Kenneth and Sarah Ramsey, who were clients of Frankel. The colt is trained by Chad Brown, who was Frankel&#x27;s New York assistant.

In 2010, the San Gorgonio Handicap - a race Frankel won eight times - was renamed the Robert J. Frankel Memorial Handicap in his honor.

In 2008 a colt from Juddmonte Stud was named Frankel in honour of the trainer. The colt, bred out of Galileo and Kind, was trained in Newmarket (England) by Sir Henry Cecil, won all of his 14 starts, and received the highest rating ever awarded by the British publication &quot;Timeform&quot;. After his 14th win in October 2012, it was announced Frankel was to be retired to stud.

In 2004, he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>The O and P class was a class of destroyers of the British Royal Navy. Ordered in 1939, they were the first ships in the War Emergency Programme, also known as the 1st and 2nd Emergency Flotilla, respectively. They served as convoy escorts in World War II, and some were subsequently converted to fast second-rate anti-submarine frigates in the 1950s.

==Design==
The O and P class were based on the hull and machinery of the preceding J class, but with more sheer forward to counter the poor riding qualities of the Js. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer.

===O class===
The O-class ships were built in two groups of four. The first group had 4.7 inch guns. They were in low-angle mounts which could elevate to only 40 degrees, and were additionally fitted with a 4-inch anti-aircraft gun in place of one set of torpedo tubes. The second group had guns in high-angle mounts and were fitted to act as minelayers; they could be recognized by the flat &quot;beaver tail&quot; stern over which the mines were dropped.

When carrying mines they had to land Y gun, their torpedo tubes and depth charges. The designed anti-aircraft armament was one quadruple QF 2-pounder &quot;pom pom&quot; and a pair of quadruple 0.5-inch Vickers A/A machine guns. The latter proved to be outdated, and were replaced by 20 mm Oerlikon guns as they became available, with a total of six single mounts eventually being carried.

===P class===
The P class were repeats of the O class, armed entirely with 4 inch guns, in high-angle mounts fitted with a new tall design of shield which did not require the ships to lose a set of torpedo tubes to take on further AA guns.

==Ships==

===O class===
All ships survived the war. Five of them were involved in the Battle of the Barents Sea, &quot;Onslow&quot; being badly damaged. After the battle, the ships were refitted with tall lattice masts instead of the normal mast.


All of the O-class ships with 4-inch armament were fitted for minelaying.

===P class===
They served mainly in the Mediterranean, where four ships were lost.

<doc id="1203047" wikidata="Q824122" url="?curid=1203047" title="Tui, Pontevedra">
<text>Tui (; ) is a municipality in the province of Pontevedra, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It is located in the &quot;comarca&quot; of O Baixo Miño on the right bank of the Miño River, facing the Portuguese town of Valença. The municipality of Tui is composed of 11 parishes: Randufe, Malvas, Pexegueiro, Areas, Pazos de Reis, Rebordáns, Ribadelouro, Guillarei, Paramos, Baldráns and Caldelas.

Two bridges connect Tui and Valença: Tui International Bridge (known in Portugal as &quot;Valença International Bridge&quot; or &quot;Friendship Bridge&quot;), completed in 1878 under the direction of Pelayo Mancebo, and a modern one from the 1990s. Both Portugal and Spain being signatories of the Schengen Treaty, there are normally no formalities in crossing what is the busiest border-point in northern Portugal.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The Tui area was inhabited since prehistoric times. Evidence of this are the sites found during construction of the highway Vigo-Tui, on the border with Porriño, dating from the Lower Paleolithic period which was the oldest in Galicia.

The fertile valley of the Minho and its magnificent natural conditions allowed the Tudense territory to accommodate human settlement from the earliest times. The vestiges are from the Palaeolithic period (20,000 BC) in the fluvial terraces of the river Minho and Louro and from the Neolithic period (5,000 BC) are the Carrasqueira ax or megalithic monuments (Anta - Areas). The introduction of metallurgy (4,000 BC) left testimonies like the helmet of bronze Caldelas axes (now in the Tudense Diocesan Museum) or engravings of Randufe.

===Middle Ages===

Its original local name, &quot;Tude&quot;, was mentioned by Pliny the Elder and by Ptolemy in the first century AD. It became an episcopal see no later than the 6th century, during the Suevic rule, when Bishop Anila went to the second Council of Braga. Later, in the Visigothic period, it briefly served as the capital of a Galician subkingdom under king Wittiza. After the campaigns of Alfonso I of Asturias (739–757) against the Moors, the town lay abandoned in the largely empty buffer zone between Moors and Christians, being later part of the &quot;Repoblación&quot; (repopulation) effort carried out a century later, during the reign of Ordoño I of Asturias (850–866). In the 10th century, it was raided by Vikings, being abandoned and later re-established in its current location. In the 12th century it was taken from the Moors by Alphonso VII. Today the town centre is near the Inn of San Telmo.

On top of the hill, the cathedral (11th–13th century, and restored between the 15th and 19th centuries) preserves Romanesque elements in its main vestibule, and the Gothic period in the western vestibule. The town has two museums, one dedicated to archaeology and sacred art, while the other is the diocesan museum.

As a frontier fortress the town played an important part in the wars between Portugal and Castile.

Historically, there was a Jewish community in Tui during the Middle Ages. Interestingly, there is a menorah engraved in the Tui Cathedral, symbolizing the relationship between Jews and Christians in Tui.

==Economic and productive activity==
Industry in the city of Tui is gradually gaining weight, as with the construction of industrial estate areas, many national and international companies have established production facilities there. Yet the industry is not more than 20% of GDP in the city.

Construction, one of the fastest growing sectors of Tui, estimated at 4.2% in 2005. The trend shows an increase in residential construction, driven by the slight slowdown in the increase of the cost of living.

==Tourism==
Although Tui is just north of the border with Portugal, a shortened version of the Portuguese Way of the Camino de Santiago commences there, and as the distance is , this walk is long enough for pilgrims to obtain a pilgrim&#x27;s certificate.

<doc id="1203060" wikidata="Q982335" url="?curid=1203060" title="Pote Sarasin">
<text>Pote Sarasin (25 March 1905 – 28 September 2000) was the ninth prime minister of Thailand from September 1957 to December 1957. He belonged to the influential Sarasin family. He served as foreign minister from 1949 to 1950 and then served as ambassador to the United States. In September 1957 when Sarit Thanarat seized power in a military coup, he appointed Pote to be the Prime Minister of Thailand. He resigned in December 1957. Pote also served as the first Secretary General of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization from September 1957 until 1963.

==Early life and education==
A native of Bangkok, Pote Sarasin was born in 1905 to a Thai Chinese family of rice merchants and landowners. His father Wee Thian Hee was a doctor and rice merchant. Pote attended Bangkok Christian College before being sent to Wilbraham Academy, a boarding school in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, United States. He later studied law in the United Kingdom and was called to the bar at Middle Temple in London. From 1933 to 1945, he practised as an attorney in Bangkok.

==Political career==
A close friend of the temporarily disempowered prime minister Phibunsongkhram (Phibun), Pote provided financial aid to the field marshal after his release from prison in 1946. In return Phibun had Pote appointed deputy minister of foreign affairs in 1948.

As foreign minister Pote was a wilful opponent of Phibun&#x27;s attempts to recognise the French-backed Bảo Đại of Vietnam, a stance that had the full support of parliament, the press, and much of the government. Pote recognised the Bảo Đại&#x27;s lack of popular appeal and doubted any chance of success and suspected that the Vietnamese might turn hostile, and explained to a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter that &quot;if they [the Thais] backed Bảo Đại and he failed, the animosity of the people of the country Vietnam would be turned against the Siamese.&quot; In the end Phibun discarded months of Foreign Ministry recommendations and on 28 February issued formal recognition of the royal governments of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Embittered, Pote resigned. It was the only time a Thai foreign minister resigned on a matter of principle. Shortly afterward, he became ambassador to Washington once again.

On 21 September 1957, Sarit chose Pote to head the coup-installed government, mainly because the American-educated diplomat had good relations with the Americans. Under him largely free and fair elections were held in December. He resigned from the premiership that same month to resume his post as Secretary General of SEATO.

==Family==

Pote was a scion of the Sarasin family, one of Bangkok&#x27;s oldest and wealthiest assimilated Chinese families. The Sarasins had always cultivated good relations with the bureaucratic elite of the 19th century, and by the early 1950s held substantial interests in real estate and rice trading. His father, Wee Thian Hee, was the son of a traditional Chinese doctor and pharmacist who had immigrated from Hainan to Siam in the early 19th century.

Pote&#x27;s sons are Pong, deputy minister of Thailand and a leading businessman and, Police General Pao, who once served as the Chief of the Royal Thai Police, and Arsa, who, like his father, was also one of the former foreign ministers of Thailand and was serving as the late King Bhumibol&#x27;s Principal Private Secretary. All three sons–Pong, Arsa and Pao Sarasin had all served as the Deputy Prime Ministers of Thailand.

<text>The Mercury dime is a ten-cent coin struck by the United States Mint from late 1916 to 1945. Designed by Adolph Weinman and also referred to as the Winged Liberty Head dime, it gained its common name because the obverse depiction of a young Liberty, identifiable by her winged Phrygian cap, was confused with the Roman god Mercury. Weinman is believed to have used Elsie Stevens, the wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens, as a model. The coin&#x27;s reverse depicts a &quot;fasces&quot;, symbolizing unity and strength, and an olive branch, signifying peace.

By 1916, the dime, quarter, and half dollar designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber had been struck for 25 years, and could be replaced by the Treasury, of which the Mint is a part, without Congressional authorization. Mint officials were under the misapprehension that the designs had to be changed, and held a competition among three sculptors, in which Barber, who had been in his position for 36 years, also took part. Weinman&#x27;s designs for the dime and half dollar were selected.

Although the new coin&#x27;s design was admired for its beauty, the Mint made modifications to it upon learning that vending machine manufacturers were having difficulties making the new dime work in their devices. The coin continued to be minted until 1945, when the Treasury ordered that a new design, featuring recently deceased president Franklin Roosevelt, take its place. The Mercury dime was minted again but in gold for its centenary in 2016.

== Inception ==

On September 26, 1890, the United States Congress passed an act providing:

The Barber coinage had been introduced in 1892; similar dimes, quarter dollars, and half dollars, all designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The introduction had followed a design competition to replace the Seated Liberty coinage, which had been struck since the 1830s. The Mint had offered only a small prize to the winner, and all invited artists refused to submit entries. The competition was open to the public, and the judging committee found no entry suitable. Mint Director Edward Leech responded to the failed competition by directing Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar. The Barber coinage, after its release, attracted considerable public dissatisfaction.

Beginning in 1905, successive presidential administrations had attempted to bring modern, beautiful designs to United States coins. Following the redesign of the double eagle, eagle, half eagle and quarter eagle in 1907 and 1908, as well as the penny and nickel redesigns of 1909 and 1913 respectively, advocates of replacing the Barber coins began to push for the change when the coins&#x27; minimum term expired in 1916. As early as 1914, Victor David Brenner, designer of the Lincoln cent, submitted unsolicited designs for the silver coins. He was told in response that Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo was completely occupied with other matters.

On January 2, 1915, an interview with Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce appeared in the &quot;Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record&quot;:

In January 1915, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury William P. Malburn sent McAdoo a memorandum about the silver subsidiary coinage, noting that &quot;the present silver half dollar, quarter, and dime were changed in 1892, and a new design may, therefore, be adopted in 1916. This can be done any time in the year.&quot; In reply, McAdoo wrote &quot;[l]et the mint submit designs before we try anyone else.&quot; on the memorandum.

In April 1915, Robert W. Woolley took office as Mint Director. On April 14, he asked Superintendent Joyce to request Chief Engraver Barber, then in his 36th year in office, to prepare new designs. The same day, Malburn requested the opinion of the Treasury Department&#x27;s Solicitor concerning the Mint view that it could strike new designs for the three denominations in 1916. On April 17, the Solicitor&#x27;s Office responded that the Mint could change the designs. At the time, the Mint was intensely busy producing the Panama-Pacific commemorative coin issue, and immediate action was not taken. In October, Barber was summoned to Washington to discuss coin designs with Woolley, though it is uncertain whether or not he had already prepared sketches for the new coinage.

On December 3, Woolley met with the Commission of Fine Arts. Woolley asked the Commission to view sketches produced by the Mint&#x27;s engraving department. Barber was present to explain the coinage process to the Commission members. Woolley suggested to the members that if they did not like the Mint&#x27;s work, they should select sculptors to submit designs for the new pieces. It was Woolley&#x27;s intent to have distinct designs for the dime, quarter and half dollar—previously, the three pieces had been near-identical. The director informed the Commission that as the existing coinage had been in use for 25 years, it would have to be changed—something which numismatic historian David Lange calls a &quot;misinterpretation of the coinage laws&quot;.

The Commission disliked the sketches from the Mint (submitted by Barber) and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek to submit proposals for the new coins. The sculptors could submit multiple sketches. Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor, the designs were not fully interchangeable—by statute, an eagle had to appear on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime. Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece.

The three sculptors submitted design sketches in mid-February, and on February 23 met with Woolley in New York so the artists could make presentations of the work to him and answer his questions. After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo, Weinman was notified on February 28 that five of his sketches had been selected—for the dime and half dollar, and the reverse of the quarter. The same day, Woolley wrote to MacNeil to tell him he would sculpt the quarter&#x27;s obverse, and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success. Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist, and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter, subject to his making modifications to his submission.

On March 3, the new coins were publicly announced, with the Treasury noting, &quot;[d]esigns of these coins must be changed by law every 25 years and the present 25 year period ends with 1916.&quot; The press release indicated that the Treasury hoped production of the new coins would begin in about two months, once the designs were finalized. The same day, Woolley wrote to Mint Engraver Barber, telling him that his sketches were rejected, and that models from Weinman and MacNeil would arrive at the Philadelphia Mint no later than May 1. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, Barber became &quot;sullen and totally uncooperative&quot;. Lange notes that &quot;numerous delays were encountered as the artists fine-tuned their models while simultaneously avoiding obstacles thrown in their path by Barber. While his observations regarding many aspects of practical coinage were quite accurate, they clearly could have been presented in a more constructive manner.&quot; In his book on Mercury dimes, Lange notes that Barber, by then aged 75, had been &quot;compelled over the past ten years to participate in the systematic undoing of a lifetime&#x27;s achievements&quot;; he had to participate in the process which resulted in coins designed by others replacing ones designed by him.

With the new pieces, all American coins would have had a recent change of design (the Morgan dollar was not then being struck). According to a column in &quot;The Art World&quot; magazine later in 1916,

== Design ==

Weinman never disclosed the name of the model for the obverse, and no person ever claimed to have been her. The winged Liberty is widely believed, however, to have been based on a 1913 bust Weinman sculpted of Elsie Stevens, wife of Wallace Stevens. A lawyer and insurance executive, Wallace Stevens later became famous as a poet; Wallace and Elsie Stevens rented an apartment from Weinman from 1909 to 1916. In a draft of his unpublished autobiography, Woolley wrote that Weinman refused to name the model, but told him it was the wife of a lawyer who lived above his Manhattan apartment (Woolley, in a later version, omitted the location, saying only that Weinman said it was the wife of a lawyer friend). Woolley recorded that he was told that the model wore the top of an old pair of stockings to simulate the cap. In 1966, Holly Stevens, Wallace and Elsie&#x27;s daughter, noted in her edition of her father&#x27;s letters that Elsie had been the model for Weinman&#x27;s dime and half dollar. Liberty&#x27;s features also bear a resemblance to the face of Victory in Weinman&#x27;s 1909 statuary group erected in Baltimore, the &quot;Union Soldiers and Sailors&#x27; Monument&quot;.

Weinman&#x27;s dime depicts Liberty with a wreath of tight curls, and wearing a traditional &quot;pileus&quot;, or Liberty cap. His depiction of the &quot;pileus&quot; as a winged cap has provoked comparisons with Roman Republic &quot;denarii&quot;, which art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered superficial. Weinman wrote that he considered the winged cap to symbolize &quot;liberty of thought&quot;. Vermeule suggests that one reason for the use of wings was that Weinman, in common with many in the tradition of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, under whom Weinman had studied, liked the effect of feathers done in relief. The reverse depicts a &quot;fasces&quot;, the object carried by &quot;lictors&quot;, who accompanied Roman magistrates; on the coin it represents war and justice. It is contrasted with a large olive branch symbolizing peace. According to Breen, &quot;Weinman&#x27;s symbolic message in this design ... was clearly an updated &#x27;Don&#x27;t tread on me&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;fasces&quot; is bound both horizontally and diagonally by a leather strap, with the loose ends at the bottom. The lettering is in Roman style, and is made as discreet as possible. Weinman&#x27;s monogram, AW, appears on the obverse, midway between the date and the letter Y in &quot;&quot;. The mintmark is located on the reverse, to the right of the first E in &quot;&quot;.

Woolley described the design in his 1916 report to the Secretary of the Treasury:

== Preparation ==


After Weinman&#x27;s success in the competition, he visited the Mint to discuss conversion of his models to finished dies. The first time, he found Barber absent, but had a productive talk with long-time Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan. Other visits followed, and on March 29, Woolley wrote to Superintendent Joyce, &quot;confidentially, the sculptors designing the new coins felt that on their last trip Mr. Morgan was much more cordial and cooperative than Mr. Barber was. I realize I am dealing with artistic temperaments at both ends.&quot; A severe case of tonsillitis delayed Weinman&#x27;s work, and caused him to request an extension of the May 1 deadline. On May 29, Woolley wrote Weinman that the designs, both for the dime and half dollar, were accepted by the Mint.

As no Barber pieces of any of the three denominations had been struck in 1916, the pent-up demand was high. On June 24, Woolley wrote to Joyce:

Two days later, work on dies was stopped when it was decided that the lettering was insufficiently distinct. The delay, however, did not prevent the Mint from authorizing payment to Weinman for his designs. On July 15, Woolley resigned as Mint director to work as publicity chairman of the Wilson reelection campaign. As the new director, Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken, did not take office until September 1, 1916, Fred H. Chaffin became acting director. With none of the new designs ready for production, and small change in great demand, the Mint had no alternative other than to strike Barber dimes and quarters by the million.

After the lettering problems were addressed, Acting Director Chaffin halted production of Barber dimes on August 29, and ordered production of the Mercury dime to begin the following day at the Philadelphia Mint. Barber had prepared dies for the Denver and San Francisco mints, but they were still in transit. Small quantities of the new dime had been sent to vending machine and pay phone manufacturers; on September 6, two companies reported problems with the coins. AT&amp;T complained that the new dimes were too thick and would not work in their phones. American Sales Machines (owned by Clarence W. Hobbs, whose complaints had delayed the Buffalo nickel) requested design changes so that its counterfeit detector could work. Von Engelken ordered production of the dimes halted. In reality, the dime was not too thick, but the rim of the coin struck too high, a defect known as a &quot;fin&quot;. This had been an ongoing problem as Weinman&#x27;s design was produced, but was thought to have been corrected. No dimes had yet been struck at the two western mints. Minting of Barber dimes resumed. After an article quoting Joyce appeared in the press, Von Engelken instructed his staff not to speak to reporters.

The problems with the dime were a potential embarrassment with a presidential campaign underway. McAdoo enquired how much time would be required for another design to be struck; he was informed it would take months. Instead, Weinman prepared modified designs, separating the letters of &quot; slightly from the rim, and lowering the relief. McAdoo approved the revised design on September 28. These changes assuaged the concerns of both firms. Von Engelken authorized Joyce to produce coinage dies on October 6, and the new coins were put into production. The earlier strikes, including those reclaimed from the testing companies, were melted, though one specimen is currently known to exist.

== Release and production; name and design controversies ==

The Mercury dime was released into circulation on October 30, 1916, the same day that production of the Barber dime ceased. Several newspapers complained that Weinman&#x27;s monogram was too prominent on the obverse; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Treasury was considering removal. On November 4, Weinman enquired of Joyce whether any removal was contemplated; he received in reply compliments on his design and Joyce&#x27;s statement that the Mint was not responsible for what appeared in print. Weinman wrote again, hoping to make changes to the dime, but was told that only an act of Congress could change the design.

Of the three circulating coins first struck in 1916, the Mercury dime was particularly praised. On the first day of circulation, quantities sold were limited at banks. One Minneapolis newspaper dubbed it the &quot;battle ax&quot; or &quot;golf&quot; dime, reflecting a lack of knowledge concerning the &quot;fasces&quot;. A letter to the editor in the January 1917 &quot;The Numismatist&quot; appears to be the first numismatic reference to the coin by the nickname &quot;Mercury&quot;. Lange traced the history of this misnomer,

Chief Engraver Barber died on February 18, 1917, having served 37 years in office. His successor was the 72-year-old Morgan, who had served under Barber for his entire tenure.

The dime was struck in substantial numbers until 1930, with the notable exception of the 1916-D issue and from 1921 to 1923, when an economic downturn caused the need for coins to diminish. No dimes were struck for 1922, the first time since 1826 that this had occurred. With the onset of the Great Depression, mintages dropped again in 1930 and 1931; coinage of dimes was suspended entirely in 1932 and 1933. The low-mintage dates are not rare today as many were hoarded, and 1930- and 1931-dated dimes proved readily available from the banks once the economy improved. With the economy beginning to pick up again, coinage resumed in 1934, and the dime was struck in large numbers each year through the end of the series.

In the early 1930s, with the rise of fascist movements in Europe, objections began to be raised in the United States to the presence of fasces, the emblem of Mussolini&#x27;s National Fascist Party, on the dime&#x27;s reverse. However, defenders of the dime stressed that the fasces were meant as a symbol of unity.

The death of President Franklin Roosevelt in April 1945 brought immediate calls for a coin to be issued with his image. As Roosevelt had been closely associated with the March of Dimes, and as the dime&#x27;s design could be replaced without the need for congressional action as it had been struck for more than 25 years, the Treasury chose that denomination to honor Roosevelt. Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, Morgan&#x27;s successor, executed the design featuring Roosevelt, which replaced the Mercury dime in 1946, making 1945 the last year in which it was produced. According to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, a total of 2,677,232,488 Mercury dimes were struck.

== Collecting ==

The 1916-D Mercury dime, struck at the Denver Mint, is the key date of the series, with a mintage of 264,000 pieces. The low mintage is because in November 1916, von Engelken informed the three mint superintendents of a large order for quarters, and instructed that Denver strike only quarters until it was filled. Striking of dimes at Denver did not resume until well into 1917, making the 1917-D relatively rare as well.

Few varieties are known in the Mercury dime series. The 1942/41 is generally termed an overdate; it is actually a doubled die error—the obverse die from which the coins were struck took one impression from a 1942-dated hub and one from a 1941-dated hub (until the 1990s, dies required two strikes from a hub for the design to be fully impressed). Sinnock stated that the pieces were most likely struck in late 1941, when preparation of the 1942 dies was under way. Also produced at that time, though less apparent to the naked eye, was the 1942/1-D. Another popular variety is the 1945-S &quot;Micro S&quot;, with a smaller-than-normal mintmark. This variety was caused by the Mint&#x27;s wartime use of a puncheon (used to impress mintmarks on dies and hubs) which had been made for use with early 20th century Philippine coinage struck at San Francisco, which had only a small space for the mintmark. Beginning in 1928, coin albums were issued by private publishers, mostly in folder form, which were widely used to collect the pieces. This led to a great increase in interest in collecting current coinage by date and mintmark.

Many Mercury dimes were not fully struck, meaning that design detail was lost even before the coins entered circulation. Exceptionally well-struck dimes display &quot;full bands&quot;, that is, the horizontal bands on the &quot;fasces&quot; show full detail. In circulation, the reverse tended to more readily display wear due to a lower rim in relation to the relief of the design. Most well-circulated dimes show more wear to the reverse.

Although no 1923 or 1930 dimes were struck at Denver, specimens appearing to be 1923-D or 1930-D dimes may be encountered. These counterfeits are struck in good silver, allowing the coiner to profit on the difference between the cost of production and the face value. They did not appear until after World War II, are invariably found in worn condition, and are believed to have been struck in the Soviet Union, a country known to have counterfeited US coins during World War II.

=== Project Mercury ===

Several Mercury dimes were flown into space on July 21, 1961, on the Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital mission, the second manned flight of Project Mercury and the second human space flight by the United States. The coins sank with the capsule in the Atlantic Ocean, but were later recovered with the capsule from a depth of nearly in 1999.

== 2016 centennial gold version ==

The Mint released a centennial version, in gold, of the Mercury dime on April 21, 2016, sold through the Mint&#x27;s official website. Demand was so high that orders were no longer able to be placed within 45 minutes of the coin becoming available. On April 26, the Mint reported that it had sold 122,510 units, just 2,490 pieces away from the item&#x27;s maximum allowable mintage. The remainder, which included about as many as 8,000 to 9,000 coins that were unsold or returned to the mint from prior sales, were offered for sale on December 15, 2016, with a limit of one per customer, and sold out within 90 minutes.

<doc id="1203063" wikidata="Q1751397" url="?curid=1203063" title="Level-set method">
<text>The Level-set method (LSM) is a conceptual framework for using level sets as a tool for numerical analysis of surfaces and shapes. LSM can perform numerical computations involving curves and surfaces on a fixed Cartesian grid without having to parameterize these objects. LSM makes it easier to perform computations on shapes with sharp corners and shapes that change topology (such as by splitting in two or developing holes). These characteristics make LSM effective for modeling objects that vary in time, such as an airbag inflating or a drop of oil floating in water. 

== Overview ==
The figure on the right illustrates several ideas about LSM. In the upper left corner is a bounded region with a well-behaved boundary. Below it, the red surface is the graph of a level set function formula_1 determining this shape, and the flat blue region represents the &quot;X-Y&quot; plane. The boundary of the shape is then the zero-level set of formula_1, while the shape itself is the set of points in the plane for which formula_1 is positive (interior of the shape) or zero (at the boundary).

In the top row, the shape&#x27;s topology changes as it is split in two. It is challenging to describe this transformation numerically by parameterizing the boundary of the shape and following its evolution. An algorithm can be used to detect the moment the shape splits in two and then construct parameterizations for the two newly obtained curves. On the bottom row, however, the plane at which the level set function is sampled is translated upwards, on which the shape&#x27;s change in topology is described. It is less challenging to work with a shape through its level-set function rather than with itself directly, in which a method would need to consider all the possible deformations the shape might undergo.

Thus, in two dimensions, the level-set method amounts to representing a closed curve formula_4 (such as the shape boundary in our example) using an auxiliary function formula_1, called the level-set function. The curve formula_4 is represented as the zero-level set of formula_1 by
:formula_8
and the level-set method manipulates formula_4 &quot;implicitly&quot; through the function formula_1. This function formula_1 is assumed to take positive values inside the region delimited by the curve formula_4 and negative values outside.

==The level-set equation==
If the curve formula_4 moves in the normal direction with a speed formula_14, then by chain rule and implicit differentiation, it can be determined that the level-set function formula_1 satisfies the &quot;level-set equation&quot; 
:formula_16
Here, formula_17 is the Euclidean norm (denoted customarily by single bars in partial differential equations), and formula_18 is time. This is a partial differential equation, in particular a Hamilton–Jacobi equation, and can be solved numerically, for example, by using finite differences on a Cartesian grid. 

However, the numerical solution of the level set equation may require advanced techniques. Simple finite difference methods fail quickly. Upwinding methods such as the Godunov method are considered better; however, the level set method does not guarantee preservation of the volume and shape of the set level in an advection field that maintains shape and size, for example, a uniform or rotational velocity field. Instead, the shape of the level set may become distorted, and the level set may disappear over a few time steps. Therefore, high-order finite difference schemes, such as high-order essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes, are often required, and even then, the feasibility of long-term simulations is questionable. More advanced methods have been developed to overcome this; for example, combinations of the leveling method with tracking marker particles suggested by the velocity field.

==Example==
Consider a unit circle in formula_19, shrinking in on itself at a constant rate, i.e. each point on the boundary of the circle moves along its inwards pointing normally at some fixed speed. The circle will shrink and eventually collapse down to a point. If an initial distance field is constructed (i.e. a function whose value is the signed Euclidean distance to the boundary, positive interior, negative exterior) on the initial circle, the normalized gradient of this field will be the circle normal.

If the field has a constant value subtracted from it in time, the zero level (which was the initial boundary) of the new fields will also be circular and will similarly collapse to a point. This is due to this being effectively the temporal integration of the Eikonal equation with a fixed front velocity.

== Applications ==

*In mathematical modeling of combustion, LSM is used to describe the instantaneous flame surface, known as the G equation.
*Level-set data structures have been developed to facilitate the use of the level-set method in computer applications.
*Computational fluid dynamics
*Trajectory planning
*Optimization
*Image processing
*Computational biophysics
*Discrete complex dynamics (visualization of the and the )

==History==
The level-set method was developed in 1979 by Alain Dervieux, and subsequently popularized by Stanley Osher and James Sethian. It has since become popular in many disciplines, such as image processing, computer graphics, computational geometry, optimization, computational fluid dynamics, and computational biology.

<doc id="1203067" wikidata="Q47023" url="?curid=1203067" title="Backscatter (photography)">
<text>In photography, backscatter (also called near-camera reflection) is an optical phenomenon resulting in typically circular artifacts on an image, due to the camera&#x27;s flash being reflected from unfocused motes of dust, water droplets, or other particles in the air or water. It is especially common with modern compact and ultra-compact digital cameras.

Caused by the backscatter of light by unfocused particles, these artifacts are also sometimes called orbs, referring to a common paranormal claim. Some appear with trails, suggesting motion.

==Cause==

Backscatter commonly occurs in low-light scenes when the camera&#x27;s flash is used. Cases include nighttime and underwater photography, when a bright light source and reflective unfocused particles are near the camera. Light appears much brighter very near the source due to the inverse-square law, which says light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.

The artifact can result from the backscatter or retroreflection of the light from airborne solid particles, such as dust or pollen, or liquid droplets, especially rain or mist. They can also be caused by foreign material within the camera lens. The image artifacts usually appear as either white or semi-transparent circles, though may also occur with whole or partial color spectra, purple fringing or other chromatic aberration. With rain droplets, an image may capture light passing through the droplet creating a small rainbow effect.

Fujifilm describes the artifacts as a common photographic problem:
In underwater scenes, particles such as sand or planktonic marine life near the lens, invisible to the diver, reflect light from the flash causing the orb artifact in the image. A strobe flash, which distances the flash from the lens, eliminates the artifacts. The effect is also seen on infrared video cameras, where superbright infrared LEDs illuminate microscopic particles very close to the lens. The artifacts are especially common with compact or ultra-compact cameras, where the short distance between the lens and the built-in flash decreases the angle of light reflection toward the lens, &quot;directly&quot; illuminating the aspect of the particles facing the lens and increasing the camera&#x27;s ability to capture the light reflected from normally subvisible particles.

==Paranormal claims==

Some ghost hunters have claimed that orb shaped visual artifacts appearing in photographs are spirits of the dead. Such perceptions have been interpreted by Michael Shermer as examples of agenticity. Prominent paranormal investigators such as Joe Nickell have agreed with skeptic-debunkers&#x27; assessments that orbs result from natural phenomena like insects, dust, pollen, or water droplets.

<text>High Falls State Park is a state park located near the city of Jackson in Monroe County, Georgia. It is the site of a prosperous 19th-century industrial center, which became a ghost town when it was bypassed by the railroad. The park contains the largest waterfall in middle Georgia and a lake.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the park&#x27;s land was a prosperous industrial town with several stores, a grist mill, cotton gin, blacksmith shop, and shoe factory. However, the town, called High Falls, became a ghost town in the 1880s when it was bypassed by a major railroad. The remains of the bridge on Old Alabama Road still partially stand to offer views of the shoals below the dam. The bridge, constructed in 1890, was mostly destroyed in the flood of 1994. The park&#x27;s trails offer visitors scenic views of the largest waterfall in middle Georgia on the Towaliga River, cascading over to the base. Historic hikes lead to the foundation of the old grist mill and ruins of the old powerhouse. The park contains a lake.

==Facilities==
*97 tent/trailer/RV Campsites
*5 picnic shelters
*1 Paddle-In Primitive Campsite
*1 Group shelter
*1 Pioneer Campground
*Miniature golf course
*Swimming pool

==Annual events==
*Canoe trips
*Forsythia Festival Crappie Tournament (March)

==Popular culture==
Dickey Betts of The Allman Brothers Band wrote an instrumental titled &quot;High Falls&quot;, named after the park, that came out in 1975. The recording is 14½ minutes long.

==Park information==
The park is open from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and the office is open from 8 p.m. until 5 p.m.
The park is free for the community, parking is $5 and there are annual passes that can be purchased. The address to easily get to the park using your GPS is 76 High Falls Park Drive, Jackson, Georgia, 30233.

<doc id="1203070" wikidata="Q1929688" url="?curid=1203070" title="Government spending">
<text>Government spending or expenditure includes all government consumption, investment, and transfer payments. In national income accounting, the acquisition by governments of goods and services for current use, to directly satisfy the individual or collective needs of the community, is classed as government final consumption expenditure. Government acquisition of goods and services intended to create future benefits, such as infrastructure investment or research spending, is classed as government investment (government gross capital formation). These two types of government spending, on final consumption and on gross capital formation, together constitute one of the major components of gross domestic product.

Spending by a government that issues its own currency is nominally self-financing. However, under a full employment assumption, to acquire resources produced by its population without potential inflationary pressures, removal of purchasing power must occur via government borrowing, taxes, custom duties, the sale or lease of natural resources, and various fees like national park entry fees or licensing fees. When these sovereign governments choose to temporarily remove spent money by issuing securities in its place, they pay interest on the money borrowed. Changes in government spending are a major component of fiscal policy used to stabilize the macroeconomic business cycle.

Public expenditure is spending made by the government of a country on collective or individual needs and wants of public goods and public services, such as pension, healthcare, security, education subsidies, emergency services, infrastructure, etc. Until the 19th century, public expenditure was limited due to laissez faire philosophies. In the 20th century, John Maynard Keynes argued that the role of public expenditure was pivotal in determining levels of income and distribution in the economy. Public expenditure plays an important role in the economy as it establishes fiscal policy and provides public goods and services for households and firms.

==Theories of public expenditure==

Several theories of taxation exist in public economics. Governments can be separated into two distinct types when it comes to their fiscal and monetary sovereignty: currency-issuers and currency-users. Currency-users at all levels (national, regional and local) need to raise revenue from a variety of sources to finance public-sector expenditures. They are not in control of the currency that their jurisdiction transacts in and so are restricted by what revenue they can raise prior to executing spending policies. Currency-issuing governments have no such nominal fiscal restriction. They have an infinite fiscal capacity in that, in principle, they can issue as much of their own currency as they like. However, real resources and productive capacity within an economy are finite. It is the acquisition of these real resources for the public purpose and a non-inflationary bias in government policy-making that places the constraint on currency-issuing government spending, rather than nominal financing from prior revenue collection.

The details of taxation are guided by two principles: who will benefit, and who can pay. Public expenditure means the expenditure on the developmental and non-developmental activity such as construction of roadways and dams, and other activity.

Rules or principles that govern the expenditure policy of the government are called &quot;canons of public expenditure&quot;. Economist George Findlay Shirras laid down the following four canons of public expenditure, although some are understood not to be required:

#Canon of benefit – public spending must be done in a manner that it brings greatest social benefits.
#Canon of economy – it says that economy does not mean miserliness. Public expenditure must be made productively and efficiently.
#Canon of sanction – public spending should not be made without sanction of an appropriate authority.
#Canon of surplus – public revenue should exceed government expenditure, this avoiding a deficit. Government must prepare a budget to create a surplus.

Three other canons are:
#Canon of elasticity – it says there should be enough scope in expenditure policy.government should be able to increase or decrease it according to the period. 
#Canon of productivity – public expenditure should encourage production efficiency of the economy.
#Canon of equitable distribution – expenditure policy should minimize inequalities and it should be designed in a way to benefit poorer sections.

===Principle of maximum social advantage===

The criteria and pre-conditions for arriving at this solution are collectively referred to as the principle of maximum social advantage. 
Taxation (government revenue) and government expenditure are the two tools. Neither of excess is good for the society, it has to be balanced to achieve maximum social benefit. Dalton called this principle as &quot;Maximum Social Advantage&quot; and Pigou termed it as &quot;Maximum Aggregate Welfare&quot;.

&quot;Dalton&#x27;s principle of maximum social advantage&quot; – maximum satisfaction should be yield by striking a balance between public revenue and expenditure by the government. Economic welfare is achieved when marginal utility of expenditure = marginal disutility of taxation. He explains this principle with reference to 
* &quot;Maximum social benefit (MSB)&quot;
* &quot;Maximum social sacrifice (MSS)&quot;

It was introduced by Swedish Economist &quot;Erik Lindahl in 1919&quot;. According to his theory, determination of public expenditure and taxation will happen on the basis of public preferences which they will reveal themselves. Cost of supplying a good will be taken up by the people. The tax that they will pay will be revealed by them according to their capacities.

==Macroeconomic fiscal policy==
Government spending can be a useful economic policy tool for governments. Fiscal policy can be defined as the use of government spending and/or taxation as a mechanism to influence an economy. There are two types of fiscal policy: expansionary fiscal policy, and contractionary fiscal policy. Expansionary fiscal policy is an increase in government spending or a decrease in taxation, while contractionary fiscal policy is a decrease in government spending or an increase in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy can be used by governments to stimulate the economy during a recession. For example, an increase in government spending directly increases demand for goods and services, which can help increase output and employment. On the other hand, contractionary fiscal policy can be used by governments to cool down the economy during an economic boom. A decrease in government spending or an increase in taxes can help reduce inflationary pressures within the economy. During economic downturns, in the short run, government spending can be changed either via automatic stabilization or discretionary stabilization. Automatic stabilization is when existing policies automatically change government spending or taxes in response to economic changes, without the additional passage of laws. A primary example of an automatic stabilizer is unemployment insurance or an employment guarantee, which provide financial assistance to unemployed workers or direct wages to recently unemployed workers, respectively. Discretionary stabilization is when a government takes actions to change government spending or taxes in direct response to changes in the economy. For instance, a government may decide to increase government spending as a result of a recession. With discretionary stabilization, most governments must pass a new law to make changes in government spending.

John Maynard Keynes was one of the first economists to advocate for government deficit spending as part of the fiscal policy response to an economic contraction. According to Keynesian economics, increased government spending raises aggregate demand and increases consumption, which leads to increased production and faster recovery from recessions. Classical economists, on the other hand, believe that increased government spending exacerbates an economic contraction by shifting resources from the private sector, which they consider productive, to the public sector, which they consider unproductive.

In economics, the potential &quot;shifting&quot; in resources from the private sector to the public sector as a result of an increase in government deficit spending is called crowding out. The figure to the right depicts an outdated theory for the market for capital, otherwise known as the market for loanable funds. The downward sloping demand curve D1 represents demand for private capital by firms and investors, and the upward sloping supply curve S1 represents savings by private individuals. The initial equilibrium in this market is represented by point A, where the equilibrium quantity of capital is K1 and the equilibrium interest rate is R1. In this theory, if the government increases deficit spending, it will borrow money from the private capital market and reduce the supply of savings to S2. The new equilibrium is at point B, where the interest rate has increased to R2 and the quantity of capital available to the private sector has decreased to K2. The government has essentially made borrowing more expensive and has taken away savings from the market, which &quot;crowds out&quot; some private investment. The crowding out of private investment could limit the economic growth from the initial increase in government spending.

A closer understanding of government fiscal operations contradicts the above loanable funds theory. In fact, in the first instance and all else equal, increased government deficit spending &quot;increases&quot; liquidity in the banking system, thereby pushing down on interest rates. Government borrowing is the act of swapping the excess bank reserves created via the increased deficit spending with Treasury securities, thus draining this excess liquidity back down to pre-spending levels. There is no &quot;loanable funds&quot; pool of currency in reality. Crowding out only refers to the shift of real resources from private to public use, not the crowding out of nominal private investment. Government deficit spending increases the net financial assets available to the non-government sector.

== Composition ==
Public expenditure can be divided into COFOG (classification of the functions of government) categories. Those categories are:

* Social protection
: pensions, subsidies for family and children, unemployment subsidies, R&amp;D (Research and Development) on social protection.
* Health
: public health services, medical products, medical appliances and equipment, hospital services, R&amp;D on healthcare.
* General Public Services
: executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs, foreign economic aid, public debt transactions, R&amp;D related to general public services
* Education
: pre-primary, primary, secondary, tertiary education, R&amp;D on education etc. See also List of countries by spending on education as percentage of government spending.
* Economic Affairs
: general economic, agriculture, fuel and energy, commercial and labour affairs, forestry, fishing and hunting, mining, manufacturing, transport, communication etc.
* Public order and safety/emergency services
: police, fire-protection services, emergency medical services, law courts, prisons, etc.
* Defence
: Military defence, civil defence, foreign military aid.
* Recreation, culture and religion
: Recreational and sporting services, cultural services, broadcasting and publishing services, religious services etc.
* Environmental protection
: waste management, pollution abatement, protection of biodiversity and landscape etc.
* Housing and community services
: Housing development, community amenities, water supply, street lighting etc.

=== Final consumption ===
Government spending on goods and services for current use to directly satisfy individual or collective needs of the members of the community is called government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) It is a purchase from the national accounts &quot;use of income account&quot; for goods and services directly satisfying of individual needs (&quot;individual consumption&quot;) or collective needs of members of the community (&quot;collective consumption&quot;). GFCE consists of the value of the goods and services produced by the government itself other than own-account capital formation and sales and of purchases by the government of goods and services produced by market producers that are supplied to households—without any transformation—as &quot;social transfers&quot; in kind.

Government spending or government expenditure can be divided into three primary groups, government consumption, transfer payments, and interest payments.

# Government consumption refers to government purchases of goods and services. Examples include road and infrastructure repairs, national defence, schools, healthcare, and government workers’ salaries.
# Investments in sciences and strategic technological innovations to serve the public needs.
# Transfer payments are government payments to individuals. Such payments are made without the exchange of good or services, for example old-age security payments, employment insurance benefits, veteran and civil service pensions, foreign aid, and social assistance payments. Subsidies to businesses are also included in this category.
# Interest payments are the interest paid to the holders of government bonds, such as saving bonds and treasury bills, including securities held by the government&#x27;s central bank. The interest paid out to the central bank on these securities effectively is interest paid out on reserve balances deposited with the central bank.

=== National defense spending ===

Stated reasons for defense spending include deterrence and active military operations. Factors of recent defense spending increases include Russian invasion of Ukraine and related deteriorating security situation.
The countries with highest total military spending are USA and China, and the countries with highest military spending as percentage of GDP in 2023 among top 20 military spenders are Ukraine, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Top 20 countries with the highest military spending 2023, where the values for China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are estimated:&quot;

Some sources say that Russian and Chinese military spending are actually far higher.

=== Healthcare and medical research ===

Research Australia found 91% of Australians think &#x27;improving hospitals and the health system&#x27; should be the Australian Government&#x27;s first spending priority.

Crowding &#x27;in&#x27; also happens in university life science research Subsidies, funding and government business or projects like this are often justified on the basis of their positive return on investment. Life science crowding in contrasts with crowding out in public funding of research more widely: &quot;10% increase in government R&amp;D funding reduced private R&amp;D expenditure by 3%...In Australia, the average cost of public funds is estimated to be $1.20 and $1.30 for each dollar raised (Robson, 2005). The marginal cost is probably higher, but estimates differ widely depending on the tax that is increased&quot;.

In the US the total investment in medical and health research and development (R&amp;D) in the US had grown by 27% over the five years from 2013 to 2017, and it is led by industry and the federal government. However, the industry accounted for 67% of total spending in 2017, followed by the federal government at 22%. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH) accounted for the lion&#x27;s share of federal spending in medical and health research in 2017 was $32.4 billion or 82.1%.

Also, academic and research institutions, this includes colleges, and universities, independent research (IRIs), and independent hospital medical research centres also increased spending, dedicating more than $14.2 billion of their own funds (endowment, donations etc.) to medical and health R&amp;D in 2017. Although other funding sources – foundations, state and local government, voluntary health associations and professional societies – accounted for 3.7% of total medical and health R&amp;D expenditure.

On the other hand, global health spending continues to increase and rise rapidly – to US$7.8 trillion in 2017 or about 10% of GDP and $1.80 per capita – up from US£7.6 trillion in 2016. In addition, about 605 of this spending was public and 40% private, with donor funding representing less than 0.2% of the total although the health spending in real terms has risen by 3.79% in a year while global GDP had grown by 3.0%.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the increase in health spending in low-income countries, and it rose by 7.8% a year between 2000 and 2017, while their economies grew by 6.4%, it is explained in the figure. However, the middle-income economies health spending grew more than 6%, and average annual growth in high-income countries was 3.5%, which is about twice as fast as economic growth. In contrast, health spending by the high-income countries continues to represent to be the largest share of global spending, which is about 81%, despite it covers only 16% of world&#x27;s population; although it down from 87% in 2000. The primary drivers of this change in global spending on healthcare are India and China, which they moved to higher-income groups. Furthermore, just over 40% of the world population lived in low-income countries, which is now dropped to 10%. Moreover, significant spending increments were in upper-middle-income economies, where population share has more than  doubled over the period, and share of global health spending nearly also doubled due to China and India&#x27;s vast population joining that group. Unfortunately, all other spending share income groups had declined.

From the continent view, North America, Western Europe, and Oceanic countries have the highest levels of spending, and West Central Asia, and East Africa the lowest, which is closely followed by South Asia, it is explained in the figure.

It is also true that fast economic growth is associated with increased health spending and sustained rapid economic growth between 2000 and 2017. Even more, fast economic growth which is generally associated with the higher government revenues and health spending is mostly located in Asia such as China, India and Indonesia followed by the Middle East and Latin America. In these countries, the real health spending per capita grew by 2.2 times and increased by 0.6 percentage point as per a share of GDP from 2000 to 2017.

=== Gross fixed capital formation ===

Government acquisition intended to create future benefits, such as infrastructure investment or research spending, is called gross fixed capital formation, or government investment, which usually is the largest part of the government. Acquisition of goods and services is made through production by the government (using the government&#x27;s labour force, fixed assets and purchased goods and services for intermediate consumption) or through purchases of goods and services from market producers. In economic theory or in macroeconomics, investment is the amount purchased of goods which are not consumed but are to be used for future production (i.e. capital). Examples include railroad or factory construction.

Infrastructure spending is considered government investment because it will usually save money in the long run, and thereby reduce the net present value of government liabilities.

Spending on physical infrastructure in the U.S. returns an average of about $1.92 for each $1.00 spent on nonresidential construction because it is almost always less expensive to maintain than repair or replace once it has become unusable.

Likewise, government spending on social infrastructure, such as preventative health care, can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year in the U.S., because for example cancer patients are more likely to be diagnosed at Stage I where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at Stage III or later in an emergency room where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal.

====Energy infrastructure====
===Science funding===
Governments fund various research beyond healthcare and medical research and defense research . Sometimes, relevant funding decision-making makes use of coordinative and prioritizing tools, data or methods, such as evaluated relevances to global issues or international goals or national goals or major causes of human diseases and early deaths (health impacts).&lt;ref name=&quot;10.2105/AJPH.2020.305645&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
Although expenditure on ministerial, elected member and staff travel makes up only a small amount of central government expenditure, and the great majority of work trips by officials are undertaken at standard or economy class, the UK&#x27;s National Audit Office has noted that this is an aspect of expenditure attracting high levels of public interest.

==Government spending by country==
=== Per capita spending ===
In 2010 national governments spent an average of $2,376 per person, while the average for the world&#x27;s 20 largest economies (in terms of GDP) was $16,110 per person. Norway and Sweden expended the most at $40,908 and $26,760 per capita respectively. The federal government of the United States spent $11,041 per person. Other large economy country spending figures include South Korea ($4,557), Brazil ($2,813), Russia ($2,458), China ($1,010), and India ($226). The figures below of 42% of GDP spending and a GDP per capita of $54,629 for the U.S. indicate a total per person spending including national, state, and local governments was $22,726 in the U.S.

=== Percentage of GDP ===

This is a list of countries by government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for the listed countries, according to the &quot;2014 Index of Economic Freedom&quot; by The Heritage Foundation and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Tax revenue is included for comparison. These statistics use the United Nations&#x27; System of National Accounts (SNA), which measures the government sector differently than the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The SNA counts as government spending the gross cost of public services such as state universities and public hospitals. For example, the SNA counts the entire cost of running the public-university system, not just what legislators appropriate to supplement students&#x27; tuition payments. Those adjustments push up the SNA&#x27;s measure of spending by roughly 4 percent of GDP compared with the standard measure tallied by the BEA.

===Public social spending===

Public social spending comprises cash benefits, direct in-kind provision of goods and services, and tax breaks with social purposes provided by general government (that is central, state, and local governments, including social security funds).

=== European Union ===
Public expenditures represented 46.7 percent of total GDP of the European Union in 2018. Countries with the highest percentage of public expenditure were France and Finland with 56 and 53 percent, respectively. The lowest percentage had Ireland with only 25 percent of its GDP. Among the countries of the European Union, the most important function in public expenditure is social protection. Almost 20 percent of GDP of European Union went to social protection in 2018. The highest ratio had Finland and France, both around 24 percent of their GDPs. The country with least social protection expenditure as percent of its GDP was Ireland with 9 percent. The second largest function in public expenditure is expenditure on health. The general government expenditure on health in European Union was over 7 percent of GDP in 2018. The country with highest share of health expenditure in 2018 Denmark with 8.4 percent. The least percentage had Cyprus with 2.7 percent. General public services had 6 percent of total GDP of European Union in 2018, Education around 4.6 percent and all other categories had less than 4.5 percent of the GDP.

==Research, assessments and transparency==
There is research into government spending such as their efficacies or effective design or comparisons to other options as well as research containing conclusions of public spending-related recommendations. Examples of such are studies outlining benefits of participation in bioeconomy innovation or identifying potential &quot;misallocations&quot; or &quot;misalignments&quot;. Often, such spending may be broad – indirect in terms of national interests – such as with human resources/education-related spending or establishments of novel reward systems. In some cases, various goals and expenditures are made public to various degrees, referred to &quot;budget transparency&quot; or &quot;government spending transparency&quot;.

===Informed and optimized allocations===
A study suggests &quot;Greater attention to the development of methods and evidence to better inform the allocation of public sector spending between departments&quot; may be needed and that decisions about public spending may miss opportunities to improve social welfare from existing budgets.

===Underlying drivers of spending alterations===
A study investigated funding allocations for public investment in energy research, development and demonstration reported insights about past impacts of its drivers, that may be relevant to adjusting (or facilitating) &quot;investment in clean energy&quot; &quot;to come close to achieving meaningful global decarbonization&quot;. The investigated drivers can be broadly described as crisis responses, cooperations and competitions.

==Principles and ethics==
Studies and organizations have called for systematically applying principles to spending decisions or to take current issues and goals such as climate change mitigation into account in all such decisions. For example, scientists have suggested in &quot;Nature&quot; that governments should withstand various pressures and influences and &quot;only support agriculture and food systems that deliver on the SDGs (in line with &quot;public funds for public goods&quot;)&quot;.

Similarly in regard to openness, a campaign by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has called for a principle of &quot;Public Money, Public Code&quot; – that software created using taxpayers&#x27; money is developed as free and open source software, and Plan S calls for a requirement for scientific publications that result from research funded by public grants being published as open access.

Public sector ethics may also concern government spending, affecting the shares and intentions of government spending or their respective rationales (beyond ethical principles or implications of the contextual socioeconomic structures), as well as corruption or diversion of public funds.

In 2012, following a United States presidential Campaign to Cut Waste, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum to the heads of federal departments and agencies calling for the avoidance of wasteful expenditure, identifying &quot;practical steps&quot; and setting specific targets for reduction of expenditure on travel, conference attendance and expense, real property and fleet management.

== History ==

=== Before World War I ===
At the end of the 19th century average public expenditure was around 10 percent of GDP. In US it was only 7 percent and in countries like United Kingdom, Germany or Netherlands it did not exceed amount of 10 percent. Australia, Italy, Switzerland and France had public expenditure over 12 percent of GDP. It was considered as a significant involvement of government in economy. This average share of public expenditure increased to almost 12 percent before the start of World War I. Due to the World War I anticipation, the share increased quickly in Austria, France, United Kingdom or Germany.

=== Effect of World War I and interwar period ===
The World War I caused a global growth of the public expenditure share in GDP. In United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and France, which were affected a lot by the war, the share of public expenditure even exceeded 25 percent. In interwar period the average share of the public expenditure was still slightly increasing. The United States increased its public expenditure with the New Deal. Other governments also increased public expenditure to create more employment. The increase was accelerated by World War II anticipation in the second part of the 30s among European countries. In 1937 the amount of average public expenditure share was between 22 and 23 percent, twice as much as before World War I. However, it is fair to mention that part of this increase of public expenditure share was caused by GDP fall. Most of industrialized countries had its GDP over 15 percent before the World War II. Only Australia, Norway and Spain had less than 15 percent of GDP.

=== World War II and post-war period ===
From the start of the World War I until 1960 the average share of public expenditure in GDP increased slowly from 22 to 28 percent. Most of this increase was given by growth of military spending caused by World War II. Spain, Switzerland and Japan had their public expenditure still below 20 percent of their GDPs.

=== Second half of the 20th century. ===
The average public expenditure, as a share of GDP, increased rapidly between years 1960 and 1980 from around 28 to 43 percent. No industrial country had this share below 30 percent in 1980. In Belgium, Sweden and Netherlands it was even over 50 percent. In last two decades of 20th century share of public expenditure kept increasing, but the growth significantly slowed down. In 1996 the average public expenditure was around 45 percent, which is in comparison with 1960–1980 period slow increase from year 1980. During 1980–1996 period the public expenditure share even declined in many countries, for example United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands etc.

===Growth of public expenditure===
There are several factors that have led to an enormous increase in public expenditure through the years

1) Defense expenditure due to modernization of defense equipment by the navy, army and air force to prepare the country for war or for prevention causes-for-growth-of-public-expenditure.
2) Population growth – It increases with the increase in population, more of investment is required to be done by government on law and order, education, infrastructure, etc. investment in different fields depending on the different age group is required.

3) Welfare activities – social welfare, pensions, etc.
* Provision of public and utility services – provision of basic public goods given by government (their maintenance and installation) such as transportation.
* Accelerating economic growth – to raise the standard of living of the people.
* Price rise – higher price level compels the government to spend an increased amount on purchase of goods and services.
* Increase in public revenue – with the rise in public revenue government is bound to increase the public expenditure.
* International obligation – maintenance of socio-economic obligation, cultural exchange etc. (these are indirect expenses of government)

4) Wars and social crises – fighting among people and communities, and prolonged drought or unemployment, earthquake, hurricanes or tornadoes may lead to an increase in public expenditure of a country. This is because it will involve governments to re-plan and allocate resources to finance the reconstruction.

5) Creation of super national organizations – E.g., the United Nations, NATO, European community and other multinational organizations that are responsible for the provision of public goods and services on an international basis, have to be financed out of funds subscribed by member states, thereby adding to their public expenditure.

6) Foreign aid – Acceptance by the richer industrialized countries of their responsibility to help the poor developing countries has channeled some of the increased public expenditure of the donor country into foreign aid programmes.

7) Inflation – This is the general rise in the price level of goods and services. It increases the cost of all activities of the public sector and thus a major factor in growth in money terms of public expenditure

=== Present ===
Since the late 1980s, the average public expenditure to GDP ratio is increasing slowly. The only industrialized countries that reduced significantly are New Zealand, Ireland and Norway. One of the reasons is growing skepticism about governmental intervention in the economy.

== Future trends in public spending ==
Looking at how the world panorama has been developing in the last years and bearing in mind various factors such as economic conditions, government priorities, demographic changes, and technological advancements, these are some key trends that will probably shape public spending in the near future:

=== Healthcare and aging population ===
As life expectancy increases all over the world, governments are expected to spend more on healthcare and pensions for elderly people. Aging populations will continue to pressure health and long-term care spending as well as pension spending while the working-age population able to finance such expenditures is decreasing, raising concerns over the system&#x27;s ability to provide these public goods/services without imposing a heavy financial burden on the working-age population. The nature of technological advancements and their implementation can either increase or decrease expenditure pressures. 

=== Digital transformation ===
As digital technology becomes integral to all aspects of life, governments may invest more in cybersecurity, digital services for citizens, and smart city technologies. According to a UN’ study, achieving an inclusive digital transformation is expected to cost $5.6 trillion annually from 2023 to 2030 for the 48 developing economies studied, equal to 18% of their combined GDP. This means the cost of universal digital connectivity and internet use, widespread access to banking and financing services is $1231 per capita.

=== Sustainability and climate change ===
As global warming becomes a critical issue, climate change mitigation and adaptation are becoming urgent. Public spending is expected to rise in areas like sustainable urban development, renewable energy sources, and climate resilience projects. Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and the consequently geo-political instability have been leading many countries to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. The high level of government spending on clean energy is motivating &quot;substantial flows of private investment&quot;, said the IEA (International Energy Agency). The IEA projects an increase in the overall level of global clean energy investment by 50% to more than $2 trillion per year in 2030.

=== Defense and security ===
Geopolitical tensions and national security concerns can also direct public spending toward defense and security. This includes not only military spending but also cybersecurity and border security. World military expenditure reached an all-time high of $2443 billion in 2023. For the first time since 2009, military spending increased across all five continents identified by SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), with significant rises observed in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East. According to Statista, in the US, the country that spends more on Defense and Security, spending in Defense is predicted to increase every year until 2034. 
=== Debt management ===
With the rise in government spending due to various crises and long-term investments, managing public debt will become a critical issue. Fiscal policies may need to balance between stimulating growth and maintaining financial stability. According to the IMF (International Monetary Fund), without any additional reforms, government spending in emerging market economies can rise by between 3 and 6 percentage points of GDP until 2050. In developed economies, where there is a greater need for consolidation and limited scope for generating extra revenue through taxes, spending reductions might be required as a component of a broader reform plan. In contrast, in many emerging markets and low-income economies, a substantial portion of the population does not have access to comprehensive public services like education and healthcare. Here, there is potential to enhance the availability of public goods and services through increased taxation. However, some reallocation of spending will also likely be necessary.

==== Government Spending Review ====
A recent instrument used to decrease the public debts in OECD countries and increase its efficiency is the Spending Reviews. These are tools that work as a collaborative effort to develop and implement policy choices by examining the government&#x27;s current expenditures within specific areas. These can have different objectives depending on the ultimate goal that governments are trying to achieve. The main aim of the Spending Reviews is to examine the value of the public money being spent, i.e., if the spending is leading to the expected outcome. SpR takes part in the budget process. After the global financial crisis, the use of spending reviews has risen significantly among OECD countries.

Political commitment and ownership are essential for the success of spending reviews. They ensure cross-government cooperation throughout the process and facilitate decisions on the goals, scope, and implementation of the recommended actions.

=== Education and workforce training ===
The rapid pace of technological change necessitates continual skill upgrades. Governments might increase investment in education, particularly in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and vocational training, to prepare the workforce for future job markets. Education is more and more seen rather as an investment than an expenditure. Each additional year of schooling typically increases a person&#x27;s yearly income by about 10%, surpassing the financial returns from investing in the stock market. Moreover, education promotes social inclusion with research indicating that investing in girl&#x27;s education gives particularly significant returns. Universal education levels the playing field by ensuring that all individuals have access to it and have the same starting-point public educational opportunities. Finally, education has a crucial role in fostering productivity. So, improving its access and quality becomes essential as countries face productivity slowdowns.

=== Public spending and SDGs ===
Public Spending is increasingly important to determine the future of the world. Its extremely large footprint makes it a powerful force for countries to achieve certain goals and standards, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 global goals, set by the General Assembly of the United Nations, cover social and economic development matters and are in the 2030 UN Agenda. Its main objective is to aim for sustainable economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection all over the world. Through their targets and indicators, these goals set a critical guide for how governments can spend money and formulate policies to approach areas where they can really make a big positive impact.

<text>The Bisnovat (later [[OKB-4 Molniya|Molniya]] then &quot;Vympel&quot;) R-40 (NATO reporting name AA-6 &#x27;Acrid&#x27;) is a long-range air-to-air missile developed in the 1960s by the Soviet Union specifically for the MiG-25P interceptor, but can also be carried by the later MiG-31. It is one of the largest production air-to-air missiles ever developed.

==Development==
The development of the Mach 3+ North American XB-70 Valkyrie threatened to make the entire interceptor and missile force of the Voyska PVO obsolete at one stroke, thanks to its incredible speed and altitude performance. In order to counter this new threat, the MiG-25 was designed, but new air-to-air missiles were also required to enable the MiG-25 to engage its intended targets at the high speeds and altitudes dictated by the requirements. The Bisnovat design bureau began development of the long-range air-to-air missile in 1962. The resulting R-40 was initially matched with the &quot;Smerch-A&quot; (&quot;Tornado-A&quot;) radar of the MiG-25. It has built in semi-active radar homing (R-40R), with an inverse monopulse seeker which give the missile ability to engage targets in all-aspects and infrared homing (R-40T) versions.

To guarantee a kill at such high speeds in thin air, a large warhead was needed to have a sufficient blast effect. Large control fins were required to give the missile enough maneuverability at high altitude. All this necessitated a very large missile; as a result, the R-40 is the largest air-to-air missile ever to enter production. It is slightly larger than the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile.

Following the defection of Soviet Air Defense Forces pilot Viktor Belenko in 1976 and the compromising of the MiG-25P&#x27;s systems and the associated R-40s, Vympel developed an improved version of the missile with a better infrared countermeasures (IRCM) resistance and more sensitive seekers. The upgraded missiles were designated with the suffix -D (for &#x27;dorabotannye&#x27;, &quot;finalized&quot;). Later -D1 versions were also developed.

Production of the R-40 ended in 1991, but it remains in limited service arming surviving MiG-25 and some MiG-31 interceptors.

==Combat history==
In Soviet service, the R-40 was never fired outside of training or testing. Standard PVO procedure was to fire a two-missile salvo at a target: one heat-seeking R-40T missile followed by a SARH R-40R, to avoid the possibility of the heat-seeking missile locking-on to the radar-guided missile.

As the MiG-25 has been exported to various states in the Middle East, the R-40 has been used in combat by Iraq and probably by Syria and Libya. 

During the Persian gulf war of 1991 on the first night, a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet of US Navy piloted by Scott Speicher of VFA-81 was shot down over western Iraq by an R-40 missile fired by an IQAF MiG-25 piloted by Zuhair Dawood.
