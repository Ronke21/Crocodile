<doc id="1213506" wikidata="Q14928311" url="?curid=1213506" title="Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)">
<text>Michael Kay (born February 2, 1961) is an American sports broadcaster who is the television play-by-play broadcaster of the New York Yankees and host of &quot;CenterStage&quot; on the YES Network, and the host of &quot;The Michael Kay Show&quot; heard on &quot;ESPN New York 880&quot; WHSQ in New York City and simulcast on ESPN Xtra on XM Satellite Radio. Kay also works on the MLB on ESPN.

== Early life and education ==
Kay was born and raised in the New York City borough of the Bronx. His father was Jewish and his mother was of Italian descent. Always a Yankee fan, Kay wore number 1 in Little League for his favorite player, Bobby Murcer. Wanting to be the Yankees announcer when he grew up, he wrote as many of his school assignments as he could about the Yankees, so he could learn all about them. Kay began his reporting career at the Bronx High School of Science and continued reporting at Fordham University for their radio station WFUV. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in communications from Fordham.

== Early career ==
Kay started his professional career with the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 1982 as a general assignment writer, with sports-specific assignments to college basketball, the National Basketball Association and the New Jersey Nets happening over time. He received the writing assignment covering the Yankees in 1987.

In 1989, Kay left the &quot;Post&quot; for the &quot;Daily News,&quot; still primarily covering the Yankees. Kay also served as the Madison Square Garden Network Yankee reporter starting in 1989.

In 1992–99, he was MSG&#x27;s locker room reporter for the New York Knicks. He had previously worked for the network as a contributor on the news-format sports show &quot;MSG SportsDesk&quot;. Kay left the &quot;Daily News&quot; to host a sports talk show on WABC in 1992, briefly returning to write &quot;Kay&#x27;s Korner&quot; for the &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1993, before taking a job doing radio broadcasts of New York Yankees games with John Sterling. Kay also worked as a reporter for Fox Sports Net in the late 1990s.

== Announcer for the New York Yankees (1992–present) ==

Kay spent a decade partnered with Sterling as the radio announcers of the team on WABC from 1992 to 2001. Kay and Sterling also paired together in 1998 for &quot;Sports Talk with John Sterling and Michael Kay,&quot; a nightly radio show which aired on WABC.

During the baseball season, the duo hosted &quot;Yankee Talk,&quot; a weekend pre-game radio show. From 1992 to 1993 Kay hosted his own show on WABC. Kay continued during that time as a spot reporter on ABC Radio, doing off-season shows with Sterling and as a fill-in sports reporter on WABC-TV. When ESPN Radio began leasing (and later purchasing) WEVD radio in 2001, Kay was chosen to host a daily radio show on the newly rechristened &quot;1050 ESPN Radio&quot;.

When WCBS acquired the radio rights to the Yankees broadcasts in 2002, Kay moved to the debuting YES Network on television and Sterling remained on the radio. Kay has been the Yankees&#x27; lead television play-by-play announcer ever since.

Kay has worked with a series of partners on YES, often with three or four different partners in the same season. Most have been former professional players, including Ken Singleton, David Cone, Al Leiter, Paul O&#x27;Neill, Jim Kaat, John Flaherty, Joe Girardi, Lou Piniella, and Bobby Murcer. Kay calls about 125 games a year for the YES Network and Prime Video (the Prime games were formerly broadcast in the Yankees&#x27; territory by a network led by WPIX-TV).

In 2008, Major League Baseball invited Kay to call the Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium during that year&#x27;s All Star festivities. On September 21, 2008, he joined Jon Miller and Joe Morgan to call the seventh inning of ESPN&#x27;s broadcast of the final home game at Yankee Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles. According to Miller, Kay was brought in because ESPN felt that they should include the local aspects of broadcasting for the Yankees for this special game, as the YES Network was not allowed to cover the game.

Since the late 1990s, Kay and Sterling have co-emceed such events as the Yankees&#x27; annual Old-Timers&#x27; Day ceremony as well as players&#x27; number retirements, anniversary celebrations for the team&#x27;s World Series victories, and the City Hall celebrations after Yankees&#x27; World Series victories.

== Other announcing work ==
Kay and Sterling also provided play-by-play commentary for Nintendo 64&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Baseball&quot; video games from 1999 to 2001. In addition to his Yankees work, Kay has called play-by-play of several postseason games on ESPN Radio, including the 2008 NLDS between the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers, the 2013 ALDS between the Detroit Tigers and Oakland Athletics, and Game 3 of the 2016 ALDS between the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays.

In January 2022, ESPN hired Kay and Alex Rodriguez to broadcast an alternate &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; broadcast on ESPN2, similar to the critically acclaimed &quot;Manningcast&quot; for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. 

That same year, Kay also called the 2022 National League Wild Card Series on ESPN alongside Rodriguez. Doing the St. Louis Cardinals-Philadelphia Phillies series, these games were noted for being the final games in the careers of Albert Pujols and Yadier Molina. The duo both went out with singles and getting standing ovations from the crowd as they exited for pinch runners. The Phillies swept the Cardinals in two games in the best of three. 

=== &quot;The Michael Kay Show&quot; ===

In 2002, Kay began hosting a drive-time talk show on WEPN (the former WEVD). That same year he began hosting the YES Network&#x27;s &quot;CenterStage&quot;, a sports and entertainment interview-format show.

Kay frequently broadcast live from the vicinity of the stadium that the Yankees were playing in that evening (his contractual exclusivity prohibited him from hosting the show from inside Yankee Stadium). This is no longer the case.

From 2009 until 2011, the 6:00 hour had been co-titled &quot;New York Baseball Tonight&quot; throughout the baseball season. Kay did not usually appear during that hour if he was broadcasting a Yankee game that evening. Don La Greca often hosted this segment and appeared with Kay on the rest of &quot;The Michael Kay Show&quot;.

When Kay is on the air for the end of his program, he usually signs off with the following: &quot;In the words of Billy Joel, life is a series of hellos and goodbyes, and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s time for goodbye again,&quot; before promoting the next program. Kay opened his first-ever simulcast on the YES Network on February 3, 2014, by dumping a bottle of Diet Coke into the garbage, a move meant to poke fun of the channel&#x27;s former occupant Mike Francesa. The canned action was widely criticized.

The final broadcast of The Michael Kay Show was on December 13th, 2024.

== Awards ==
In 2003, Kay was added to the Bronx Walk of Fame. In 2007, Kay was nominated for a number of New York Emmy Awards for his work with the YES Network, both for Yankees broadcasts and for his highly rated interview program &quot;Centerstage&quot;. He won one New York Emmy for his work on the YES Network as part of the team of the NYY broadcast: New York Yankees Baseball &quot;Manny vs. NY – Yankees/Red Sox- 5/24/06.&quot; (YES Network).

In 1998, Kay was on the MSG team that won an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Live Sports Coverage—Series&quot;. In 1996 and 1997 he was a member of the MSG team that won Emmys for &quot;Outstanding Live Sports Coverage—Single Program&quot; for Dwight Gooden&#x27;s no-hitter and &quot;The Battle for New York: Yankees vs. Mets&quot;, and he was awarded the &quot;Dick Young Award for Excellence in Sports Media&quot; by the New York Pro Baseball Scouts in 1995, and the award for Best Sports Reporter at the 2000 New York Metro Achievement in Radio Awards.

== Personal life ==
Kay married television journalist Jodi Applegate on February 12, 2011, with former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani officiating. Guests included former Yankees such as Al Leiter, Tino Martinez, and Paul O&#x27;Neill, actors Robert De Niro, Bobby Cannavale, and Billy Crystal, and actor/uncle Danny Aiello. The couple have two children: a daughter, Caledonia, born in 2013 and a son, Charles, born in 2014. He resides in Greenwich, Connecticut.

On July 3, 2019, Kay announced that he would undergo vocal cord surgery, keeping him out of the broadcasting booth from early July until late August. He returned to the booth on August 17, and returned to his radio show on August 26.

<doc id="1213508" wikidata="Q2579021" url="?curid=1213508" title="William Greider">
<text>William Harold Greider (August 6, 1936 – December 25, 2019) was an American journalist and author who wrote primarily about economics.

== Early life and education ==
Greider was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on August 6, 1936, to Harold William Greider, a chemist, and Gladys (McClure) Greider, a writer, and raised in Wyoming, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb. William Greider went on to study at Princeton University, receiving a B.A. in English in 1958.

== Career and works ==
After college, Greider began his reporting career as a reporter for the &quot;Daily Journal&quot;, a newspaper in Wheaton, Illinois. It was at that newspaper where he met his future wife, Linda Furry, a fellow reporter.

Greider then worked for &quot;The Louisville Times&quot;, and was sent to Washington, D.C., in 1966 to cover Washington for &quot;The Times&quot; and for the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;. He moved to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1968, where he was a national correspondent, an assistant managing editor for national news, and a columnist. Greider is credited with coining the term &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot; in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article dated November 13, 1968.

Greider next moved to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, where he worked from 1982 until 1999.

He was national affairs correspondent for &quot;The Nation&quot;, a progressive political weekly. Prior to his work at &quot;The Nation&quot;, he worked as an on-air correspondent for &quot;Frontline&quot; on PBS.

His 2009 book was &quot;Come Home, America: The Rise and Fall (and Redeeming Promise) Of Our Country&quot;. Before that he published &quot;The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy&quot;, which explores the basis and history of the corporation, the existence of employee-ownership as an alternative form of corporate governance, environmental issues, and how important people&#x27;s contributions are to make the economy a humane one. Given its anticipation of the issues raised by the 2008 securities crisis, Occupy Wall Street, and works with a similar theme by Gar Alperovitz, Richard Wolff, Michael Moore, Noreena Hertz, and Marjorie Kelly, it can be considered an under-recognized work.

Greider also wrote a book on globalization – &quot;One World, Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism&quot; (1997) – which suggested vulnerabilities and inequities of the global economy. The credibility of this work was heavily criticized by economist Paul Krugman, who argued that Greider ignored the fallacies of composition that run rampant in the work, misinterpreted facts (some of which were incorrect), and misled readers with false assumptions – all possibly due to his lack of consultation with economists.

Greider&#x27;s most well-known, powerful and far-reaching work is &quot;Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country&quot; (1987), which chronicles the history of the Federal Reserve, and especially from 1979 to 1987 under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, during the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.

During an October 1, 2008, broadcast interview on the impending passage of the &quot;Wall Street bailout&quot; despite widespread public opposition. Greider observed: 
On January 29, 2009, in an interview with Amy Goodman on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, Greider commented regarding the United States&#x27; financial system&#x27;s financial crisis:
== Personal life ==
William Greider was married to Linda Furry Greider and they had two children. They resided in Washington, D.C. He died at his home in Washington from congestive heart failure on December 25, 2019.

<text>The Voice of Greece (), also known as ERA 5, is the international service of Greek state radio on shortwave and via satellite and the internet. On 11 June 2013, the Greek government announced the closure of the state broadcaster ERT from 12 June 2013 as an austerity measure.

As of 24 June 2013, The Voice of Greece was broadcasting intermittently again on shortwave on 9420 kHz, 9935 kHz, 11645 kHz, but the live online stream had not resumed. A live stream began operating again in mid-2015.

==History==
The first state radio of Greece, Athens Radio, was inaugurated in spring 1938 with a 15 kW transmitter in the Liosia suburb and the studios of the Zappeion Mansion.

The first attempt for establishing a shortwave radio station took place immediately after the Greco-Italian War broke out in October 1940. Athens Radio programmes were transmitted from a small transmitter in the centre of Athens to the front and the Balkans. A special shortwave programme was created after the German-Italian occupation in 1947. Transmissions began from a 7.5 kW transmitter to Cyprus, Egypt, Turkey, the Balkans and the Soviet Union, while four transmissions were made to Greek navigators.

The daily news bulletins were broadcast in 12 foreign languages (Arabic, German, Russian, Spanish, Romanian, Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Albanian, French, Polish, and English) and once a week in Arabic. A music programme was also broadcast.

The shortwave transmission centre was established in 1972 with two 110 kW transmitters in Avlis, northeast of Athens, with transmitting antennas directed to the inhabited continents.

After the collapse of the military junta in 1974, the shortwave programme was named &quot;The Voice of Greece&quot; and came under the then Radio News Management. Almost 15 years later, with the institutionalisation and implementation of the Unified ERT body, it became autonomous and was named &quot;The Fifth Programme - The Voice of Greece&quot;, coming under the ERA General Management.

==Profile==
ERA 5 transmits on shortwave (9420 kHz, 9935 kHz and 11645 kHz) continually for 23 hours and at mediumwave for about 10 hours.

ERA 5 transmits 19 bulletins in Greek daily. The programme also includes informative programs of political, cultural and folklore interest, as well as musical programs that promote Greek songs. ERA 5 is mainly characterised by programs that bring it to direct contact with its listenership through telephone calls and letters.

ERA 5 is not only intended for Greeks living abroad, but also for foreigners living in Greece and abroad. It accomplishes this through a daily programme in many languages on shortwave and mediumwave.

This programme is transmitted in 12 languages: English, German, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Albanian, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian, Turkish and Arabic.

<text>Sequential is an American synthesizer company founded in 1974 as Sequential Circuits by Dave Smith. In 1978, Sequential released the Prophet-5, the first programmable polyphonic synthesizer, which was widely used in the music industry. In the 1980s, Sequential was important in the development of MIDI, a technical standard for synchronizing electronic instruments.

In 1987, Sequential went out of business and was purchased by Yamaha. Smith continued to develop instruments through a new company, Dave Smith Instruments. In 2015, Yamaha returned the Sequential Circuits trademark to Dave Smith Instruments, which rebranded as Sequential in 2018. In 2021, Sequential was acquired by the British audio technology company Focusrite. Smith died in 2022.

== History ==
=== 1974–1980: Founding, first products and Prophet-5 ===
The engineer Dave Smith founded Sequential Circuits in San Francisco in 1974. The first Sequential Circuits product was an analog sequencer for use with Moog and ARP synthesizers, followed by a digital sequencer and the Model 700 Programmer, which allowed users to program Minimoog and ARP 2600 synthesizers. The Model 800, launched in 1975, was controlled and programmed with a microprocessor.

At the time, Smith had a full-time job working with microprocessors, then a new technology. He conceived the idea of combining them with synthesizer chips to create a programmable synthesizer, but did not pursue the idea, assuming Moog or ARP would design the instrument first. When no instrument emerged, in early 1977, Smith quit his job to work full-time on a design for the Prophet-5, the first fully programmable polyphonic synthesizer. He demonstrated it at the NAMM International Music &amp; Sound Expo in January 1978 and shipped the first models later that year.

Whereas previous synthesizers required users to adjust cables and knobs to change sounds, with no guarantee of exactly recreating a sound, the Prophet-5 used microprocessors to store sounds in patch memory. This facilitated a move from synthesizers creating unpredictable sounds to producing &quot;a standard package of familiar sounds&quot;. The Prophet-5 became a market leader and industry standard, used by musicians such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Dr Dre, and by film composers such as John Carpenter. It was followed by the larger Prophet-10, which featured two keybeds and was less successful as it was notorious for unreliability. The smaller Pro-One, essentially a monophonic Prophet-5, saw more success.

=== 1981–1982: MIDI ===

In 1981, Ikutaro Kakehashi, the founder of the Japanese synthesizer company Roland, contacted Smith about creating a standardized means of synchronizing electronic instruments manufactured by different companies. Smith and the Sequential engineer Chet Wood designed an interface using Roland&#x27;s Digital Control Bus (DCB) as a basis. This standard was discussed and modified by representatives of Roland, Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai. The protocol was named Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith, who received Technical Grammy Awards in 2013 for their work. In 1982, Sequential released the Prophet 600, one of the first MIDI-equipped synthesizers. In 1984, they released the Drumtraks, one of the first drum machines with MIDI control.
=== 1987: Closure ===
In 1987 Sequential Circuits released their final product, the Prophet 3000 digital sampler. Only several dozen units were produced before the company went out of business. Smith blamed the closure on the decision to move to computer audio in prior years: &quot;We were too small and under-capitalized, and we were a few years too early in the market ... It drained our resources, so by the time we pulled back to professional instruments, it was too late.&quot;

Sequential Circuits was purchased by the Japanese corporation Yamaha. They released no products under the Sequential name and shut it down in 1989, following the failure of the TX16W digital sampler. Smith and much of the development team moved to Korg, where they worked mainly on the Wavestation synthesizer.

=== 2002–2014: Dave Smith Instruments ===
In 2002, after several years of working on software synthesis, Smith opened a new company, Dave Smith Instruments, to build new hardware. Its first product was the Evolver synthesizer in 2002. In 2008, Dave Smith Instruments launched the Prophet &#x27;08, conceived as an affordable eight-voice analog synthesizer.

=== 2015–present: Return to Sequential and Focusrite acquisition ===
In January 2015, Yamaha returned the Sequential Circuits brands to Smith in a goodwill gesture. This was at the encouragement of Kakehashi, who had worked with Smith to create MIDI. Kakehashi said: &quot;I feel that it&#x27;s important to get rid of unnecessary conflict among electronic musical instrument companies. That is exactly the spirit of MIDI. For this reason, I personally recommended that the President of Yamaha, Mr. Nakata, return the rights to the Sequential name to Dave Smith.&quot;
In 2015, Sequential released the Prophet-6, followed in 2018 by the Prophet-X, which featured sample playback and digitally controlled oscillators. On August 31, 2018, the 40th anniversary of the Prophet-5, Dave Smith Instruments rebranded as Sequential. In September 2020, Sequential announced an updated reissue of the original Prophet-5. Sequential reported revenues of $18.3 million in 2020. In April 2021, Sequential was acquired by the British audio technology company Focusrite. Smith died on May 31, 2022.

<text>ERC is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client integrated into GNU Emacs. It is written in Emacs Lisp.

==Features==
ERC includes message timestamping, automatic channel joining, flood control, and auto-completion of nicks and commands.
ERC can highlight nicks and text for conversation tracking, 
highlight and optionally remove control characters, and allows URLs, nicknames and text to be converted to buttons. 
It provides input history, and separate buffers per server and channel. 
Notifications include channel activity on the Emacs mode-line, user online status, and channel tracking of hidden conversations. ERC is multi-lingual, and provides auto-script loading at startup.

ERC has a modular design, with many features implemented in &quot;more than two dozen loadable modules&quot; included in the default setup, such as &quot;autoaway&quot;, &quot;fill&quot; (splits long lines), &quot;log&quot; (saves chat buffers), &quot;spelling&quot;, &quot;bbdb&quot;, which connects ERC to Emacs&#x27; BBDB for contact management, and &quot;replace&quot;, which auto-replaces given text in messages. ERC supports SSL/TLS for encrypted IRC communication.

==History==
According to the GNU project, ERC was first developed by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin. 
Berezin wrote that ERC was &quot;originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff, then I improved it in many ways and promoted to version 2.0&quot;. The pair stopped development in 1999. Mario Lang wrote that as of 2001 ERC had been &quot;apparently abandoned&quot;, so he and Alexander Schroeder adopted it and created the ERC SourceForge project. Berezin responded positively to news of the renewed effort and bestowed stewardship to the new developers; in the ensuing years, versions 2.1, 3, 4, 5, and 5.1 were released. ERC development moved from SourceForge to GNU in May 2006, 
and ERC was officially incorporated into Emacs release 22.1 on June 3, 2007. ERC development now takes place inside the Emacs source-code tree.

==Related work==
ERC is one of two IRC clients included in the Emacs distribution; rcirc is the other. Circe and the &quot;ascetic&quot; ZenIRC are also Emacs-based IRC clients. According to its author, Circe incorporates ideas from ERC such as its &quot;activity tracker&quot; and others; it was developed as ERC became &quot;difficult to debug and improve.&quot;

<doc id="1213518" wikidata="Q2701637" url="?curid=1213518" title="Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States">
<text>Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States is a 1940 oil-on-canvas painting by Howard Chandler Christy, depicting the Constitutional Convention signing the U.S. Constitution at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787. Along with &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot; by Emanuel Leutze, the painting is one of the most famous depictions of the early days of the United States. Christy created the painting in April 1940; it is so large () that he painted it in a sail loft. It currently is displayed along the east stairway in the House of Representatives wing in the Capitol building.

==Description==
Only 39 of the 55 delegates are pictured in the painting; not included are the three delegates who did not sign the Constitution or the 13 delegates who left the convention. On the right side of the painting, on the dais, George Washington, president of the convention, stands upright and looks out over the delegates. The Constitution and the Syng inkstand are on a desk before him, and Richard Spaight of North Carolina is signing the document. The windows are open and an aura of light surrounds Washington&#x27;s upper body. Behind him are displayed American flags and a drum. Also behind him James Wilson of Pennsylvania and Richard Bassett of Delaware are talking. Behind them on the far right is Delaware delegate George Read; below them is Pennsylvania delegate Robert Morris, and standing slightly to the right of Washington is Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer from Maryland.

William Jackson, the convention&#x27;s secretary, is prominently placed directly in the center. Standing, in red, and holding up four fingers, he apparently is counting the votes. At his left elbow, James Madison observes the proceedings. Between Jackson&#x27;s right hand and head is William Paterson. Benjamin Franklin is seated in the center, and Alexander Hamilton leans toward him. Standing directly behind Hamilton is Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania. The South Carolina delegation is depicted in the painting&#x27;s left corner. Also seated on the left, distinguished by their multi-colored silk coats, are Jonathan Dayton, Rufus King (on Dayton&#x27;s left) and Nathaniel Gorham.

==Commissioning==
Representative Sol Bloom, the Director General of the United States Constitution Sesquicentennial Commission, first proposed that the painting be commissioned in 1937 as part of the 150th anniversary of the Constitution. Howard Chandler Christy, one of the most popular illustrators and portrait painters of the time, had created an historically accurate scene of the signing for the commission to reproduce. His first small painting included a maiden representing &quot;We the People&quot; and numerous other symbolic figures, but these were eliminated in the final version. In the three years during which Representative Bloom worked with Christy to locate early portraits of the signers and to fill in historical details, he became aware that there was no scene of the signing of the Constitution in the U.S. Capitol, and few other paintings in existence included all the signers.

A Joint Resolution was first introduced in the House in 1937 to pay Christy $35,000 to paint &quot;Signing of the Constitution&quot;. Heated debate arose, however: some members of Congress were in favor of memorializing one of the greatest events in American history, but others held deep reservations about spending the funds for art during a period of severe economic depression, and the bill did not pass. The Joint Resolution failed again in 1938.

Finally, in 1939, a modified resolution, P.R. 11, 76th Congress, was accepted to set up a commission consisting of the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the Architect of the Capitol to employ an artist to paint a scene of the signing at a price of $30,000. The contract with Christy was signed on July 24, 1939. On October 29, 1940, the Congress approved $1500 for the purchase of a frame, which was accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library on December 26, 1940.

==Research and work==

To achieve the greatest possible accuracy, Christy searched for portraits by the best artists of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, such as Charles Willson Peale and Gilbert Stuart. He located portraits of thirty-seven out of the thirty-nine delegates and the Secretary, William Jackson. Christy took some liberties in composing his scene: John Dickinson, whose signature was added by proxy, is included, and three men who were present but did not sign are not shown. He obscured the faces of the two signers (Thomas FitzSimons and Jacob Broom) of whom no portraits were found. He also researched authentic costumes, including a pair of George Washington&#x27;s breeches borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution, and he depicted the furniture and artifacts used by the delegates. The books beside Franklin&#x27;s chair were part of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s library; Christy borrowed them from the Rare Book Room of the Library of Congress and included them in the scene to acknowledge Jefferson&#x27;s importance to the Constitution. He made the sketch for the painting in Independence Hall in September, at the same time of day as the signing, to show accurately the angle of sunlight in the room with its glass chandelier. The artist said that the flags he depicted are the Stars and Stripes, one from a Maryland dragoon regiment, and regimental colors from Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

The huge canvas was painted in the sail loft of the Washington Navy Yard, where Christy at times used enlisted men as models for the figures. After five years of research and seven months of painting, the canvas was dedicated in May 1940 in the Rotunda of the Capitol, where it was on view for 16 months. The frame, made in nine sections including the central eagle and crest, was hand carved and given a gold-leaf finish by Azeglio Pancani of New York. After much debate about where it could be hung, another painting was moved and the Christy in its frame was installed in the east grand stairway of the House, where it remains today.

==Vandalism and restoration==
In 1967 the painting was vandalized by being slashed along the bottom; the canvas had to be removed from the stretcher to be transported for repair in 1968. The fills made then were apparent, however, and over time dust, grime, and yellowed varnish obscured the original brilliant colors. In 2006 the painting was cleaned and conserved in place by conservators working from a large four-level scaffold from mid-October through December. The cleaning of areas that had looked dull brown revealed lively expressions, detailed costumes and impressionist colors, such as lavender and pink, applied with scintillating brushwork. The vandalized area was given special attention and is now barely visible. Finally, a new coating of clear protective varnish was applied.

The frame, which had been covered with bronze powder paint in 1968, was taken apart in sections and conserved off site. It was cleaned and repaired, regilded with 22-karat gold leaf similar to the color of the original metal leaf, and toned to complement the painting.

<text>Grey Lynn is an inner suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, located to the west of the city centre. Originally a separate borough, Grey Lynn amalgamated with Auckland City in 1914.

Grey Lynn is centred on Grey Lynn Park, which was not part of the original subdivision of 1883, since the land was too steep and too wet for house construction. In 1915, the land was drained and levelled for playing fields. The park is home to the annual Grey Lynn Park Festival, which attracts around 100,000 visitors on the third Saturday in November.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in Auckland, Grey Lynn was a frequent transit point with abundant food sources and access to freshwater. Food sources included several kūmara plantations in Grey Lynn, on the hill slopes above Opoutukeha, Coxs Creek. In the late 17th or early 18th century, there were a series of raids in the area led by Kāwharu (Tainui), known as Raupatu Tīhore. Kāwharu reportedly rested his head on the ridge that is now the location of Surrey Crescent, leading to it being called Te Rae o Kāwharu (Kāwharu&#x27;s brow), which was later adopted as the Māori name of Grey Lynn School.

=== Early European settlements and farming ===
Grey Lynn was part of the first 3000-acre block of land gifted by Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei in October 1840. The Grey Lynn area was originally known as Newton until being renamed in August 1899.

In 1844 and 1845, blocks of land in the western part of Grey Lynn were auctioned off. In the early 1840s, John Monteforte bought Surrey Hills, which encompassed much of the land from Ponsonby to Richmond Roads, totalling 198 acres (80 hectares). In 1847, Thomas Crummer and James Williamson bought Surrey Hills and eventually owned all the land bounded by Ponsonby, Great North and Richmond Roads, except for &quot;three blocks at the northern end where Tutanekai, Hakanoa and Sackville streets run,&quot; the majority of modern Grey Lynn.

The Surrey Hills was leased from the early 1840s to the mid-1880s, and housed a farm and a sheep run. Notably, in 1871, Frank Lawry leased part of the Surrey Hills and created a dairy farm. Following Crummer&#x27;s death, Williamson bought the Crummer&#x27;s children&#x27;s share in Surrey Hills. When Williamson was facing financial hardship in the early 1880s, Surrey Hills was bought by the Auckland Agricultural Company.

=== Early industry and infrastructure ===
Grey Lynn had a number of brickyards, particularly along the Great North Road. In 1871, Thomas Faulder was appointed night soil contractor for Auckland, and used his land between Surrey Crescent and Tuarangi Road for its disposal. During the early 1870s, there were numerous complaints over the use of this land for this purpose, including to the Central Board of Health in 1874. The depot was relocated to Avondale in 1875. In 1906, James Tattersfield set up a mattress factory on the corner of Sackville and Richmond Road. The factory was later expanded to produce carpets.

=== Initial subdivisions ===
In 1883, the that was the Surrey Hills Estate was subdivided for residential purposes, the largest subdivision in the area at the time. In 1885, there was a depression in the economy which slowed building on the estate. In the late 1890s-early 1900s, building resumed and, by 1903, there were 1040 dwellings. With the extensions of the tramlines to West Lynn in 1910, there was another wave of subdivisions. There was also the development of shops - notably on Great North Road, Williamson Avenue and Tuarangi Road.

=== Post World War One ===
In 1902, Grey Lynn electorate voted to be dry, and this continued until 1937. This resulted in a number of non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers to establish operations in the Grey Lynn area. In addition to these businesses, in 1925, Dominion Compressed Yeast Company set up a factory in Grey Lynn to supply their North Island market, and, in 1929, Auckland Laundry Company moved its operations to Surrey Crescent. In 1938, the existing store fronts on the corners of Williamson Avenue, were replaced with the Grey Lynn Post Office and the ASB Bank.

In the 1920s, Auckland City Council began building workers housing with 60 houses built on Old Mill and West View Roads. In the 1930s, with the Great Depression, the demand for workers decreased. In the 1940s, state-owned units for pensioners were built on the Great North Road and on the corner of Surrey Crescent and Gilbert Avenue. After World War Two, Auckland&#x27;s manufacturing businesses started booming, existing factories in Grey Lynn expanded, new factories were established in the area, and there was significant demand on housing. Grey Lynn remained a largely working-class suburb until the 1970s.

=== Modern history ===
The 1970s saw a renewed interest in older Victorian properties, and from that period onwards many young professionals began buying dilapidated kauri villas in areas like Grey Lynn and renovating them. From the early 1980s, this gentrification began to visibly change the area, resulting in an increase in house prices and in higher rents. This also led to an increase in the number of people renting in Grey Lynn. In 1961, 31% of people in Grey Lynn were renting, by 1981 this had already increased to 45%.

In the 1980s and 1990s, businesses in the creative fields started developing in Grey Lynn, including the Gow Langsford Gallery on the corner of Richmond Road and Warnock Street in 1987 and Mai FM on Crummer Road in 1992. The offices of Recorded Music New Zealand are still located on Hakanoa Street. Other businesses, such as Burrell Demolition and Wilton Motor Body factory, moved out of the area, and were replaced with housing or businesses and shops that reflected the gentrification of the area.

In 1972, the Grey Lynn community requested a community centre which opened in 1975. It was redeveloped in 2000, and remains open to this day.

== Local governance ==

In 1869, the Newton Highway District and a corresponding governing board was formed, encompassing the land bordered by Great North Road, Tuarangi Road and Motions Creek. The Newton Highway Board originally administered an area of . In November 1885, the Newton Borough Council was formed and took over administration from the Highway Board. Grey Lynn was an independent borough from 1885 to 1914, led by a mayor, listed below. The Grey Lynn Borough Council merged into Auckland City Council in July 1914. In 1914 Grey Lynn was amalgamated with the City of Auckland.

==Grey Lynn Park==
Grey Lynn Park was established in the 1883, at the site of a former dairy farm. The Grey Lynn Park Festival has been held in early summer since 1984, and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2009. The event, which attracts on average 100,000 visitors each year, is organised by four people who raise money from stall fees and charitable grants. It started as a local community get-together with working-class and Pasifika roots, though the appeal has broadened through the decades. Local band Unity Pacific first performed at the festival in 1987, and have appeared many times since. They headlined in 2009.

Standing at the Ponsonby Road end of Williamson Avenue, this brick building dates from 1889, was designed by John Mitchell.
* Former Auckland Savings Bank: Located on Ponsonby Road near the intersection with Karangahape Road. This italianate building was designed in 1885 by Edward Bartley – originally a single story building it received a second story designed by the same architect in 1900. The former banking chamber is distinguished by the use of New Zealand marble. In the 1920s the lower part of the room was lined with panelling made of Cloudy Bay Marble from Nelson. Currently occupied by an Art Gallery.
* Allendale House: At the corner of Crummer Road and Ponsonby Road stands the large 1890s Italianate house of George Allen, a saddle and harness maker. Allendale is a local landmark, having been successively a doctor&#x27;s surgery, Māori girls hostel, boarding house, refuge for alcoholic men, and a restaurant.

<doc id="1213541" wikidata="Q6978780" url="?curid=1213541" title="You're the One (Paul Simon album)">
<text>You&#x27;re the One is the tenth solo studio album by the American singer-songwriter Paul Simon, released in 2000 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2001, with Simon becoming the first artist to be nominated in that category in five consecutive decades (1960s–2000s). (In 2006, Paul McCartney became the only other artist to match this feat with &quot;Chaos and Creation in the Backyard&quot;).

&quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; was also considered a comeback after the failure of Simon&#x27;s Broadway musical, &quot;The Capeman&quot;, and concept album for the musical, &quot;Songs from The Capeman&quot;, which peaked at No. 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<doc id="1213543" wikidata="Q2977124" url="?curid=1213543" title="Iowa State Capitol">
<text>The Iowa State Capitol, commonly called the Iowa Statehouse, is in Iowa&#x27;s capital city, Des Moines. As the seat of the Iowa General Assembly, the building houses the Iowa Senate, Iowa House of Representatives, the Office of the Governor, and the Offices of the Attorney General, Auditor, Treasurer, and Secretary of State. The building also includes a chamber for the Iowa Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Iowa Supreme Court building. The building was constructed between 1871 and 1886, and is the only five-domed capitol in the country.

Located at East 9th Street and Grand Avenue, the Capitol is set atop a hill and offers a panoramic view of the city&#x27;s downtown and the West Capitol Terrace. Various monuments and memorials are to its sides and front, including the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil War Monument and the &quot;Lincoln and Tad&quot; statue.

==History==
===Construction===
Not long after achieving statehood, Iowa recognized that the Capitol should be moved farther west than Iowa City, and the 1st General Assembly, in 1846, authorized a commission to select a location. In 1847, the town of Monroe City, in Jasper County, was selected as the new location of the capitol and platted out, but the 1848 Legislature decided not to move the capitol from Iowa City. In 1854, the General Assembly decreed a location “within two miles of the Raccoon fork of the Des Moines River.” The exact spot was chosen when Wilson Alexander Scott gave the state nine and one-half acres where the Capitol now stands. Final legislative approval for the construction of a permanent statehouse was given on April 8, 1870.
A three-story brick building served as a temporary Capitol and was in use for 30 years, until destroyed by fires: in the meantime, the permanent Capitol was being planned and built.

In 1870, the General Assembly established a Capitol commission including local businessman and politician Peter A. Dey to employ an architect, choose a plan for a building (not to cost more than $1.5 million), and proceed with the work, but only by using funds available without increasing the tax rate.

John C. Cochrane and Alfred H. Piquenard were designated as architects, and a cornerstone was laid on November 23, 1871. However, much of the original stone deteriorated through waterlogging and severe weather, and had to be replaced. The cornerstone was relaid on September 29, 1873.

Although the building could not be constructed for $1.5 million as planned, the Cochrane and Piquenard design was retained, and modifications were undertaken. Cochrane resigned in 1872, but Piquenard continued until his death in 1876. He was succeeded by two of his assistants, Mifflin E. Bell and W.F. Hackney. Bell redesigned the dome so that it better fit the proportions of the building. Hackney was the only architect who stayed on the project until the end.

The capitol building was dedicated on January 17, 1884, and it was completed sometime in 1886. The building commission made its final report on June 29, 1886, with a total cost of $2,873,294.59. The audit showed that only $3.77 was unaccounted for in the 15 years of construction.

===Fire and restoration===

On January 4, 1904, a fire was started when the gas lights were being converted into electricity. The fire swept through the areas that housed the Supreme Court and Iowa House of Representatives. A major restoration was performed and documented, with the addition of electrical lighting, elevators, and a telephone system. Little information is available about who performed the actual restoration during these early years. However, Elmer Garnsey created the ceiling artwork in the House Chamber.

These earlier efforts to preserve the Capitol mostly dealt with maintaining and upgrading its interior. It was not until 1965, when the dome was regilded, that legislators made significant investments in preserving the building&#x27;s exterior.

By the early 1980s, the exterior of the Capitol had noticeably deteriorated. Sandstone pieces had begun falling from the building, prompting the installation of steel canopies at all entrances of the building to protect pedestrians. Decorative stone, whose deterioration had first been documented as early as the start of the 20th century, had also eroded.

Work on the exterior restoration began in the spring of 1983 and was completed in nine phases. Phase 9 work began in the spring of 1998, and the entire project was completed in the fall of 2001, at a cost of $41 million.

===International stature===

While its primary use is as the house of the legislative branch of Iowa government, the Capitol also functions as a living museum and state and international cultural facility.

Since 1987, the World Food Prize laureate award ceremony is held annually in October in the House of Representatives chamber of the statehouse. The ceremony rivals that of the Nobel Prize, drawing over 800 people from more than 75 countries. Each year, world-class performers take the stage to honor the World Food Prize Laureate. Past performers have included Ray Charles, John Denver, and Noa to name a few. Following the ceremony, the celebration continues at a laureate award dinner held in the Capitol rotunda.

==Architecture==
The architectural design of the Capitol, rectangular in form, with great windows and high ceilings, follows the traditional pattern of 19th-century planning for public buildings. A modified and refined Renaissance style gives the impression of strength and dignity combined with utility. The building measures from north to south and from east to west.

==Exterior==
The exterior of the building is entirely of stone with elaborate columns and handsomely designed cornices and capitals. Iowa stone is the foundation for the many porticoes of the building. The building is brick with limestone from Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio, and Illinois. The substructure is of dark Iowa stone topped by a heavy course of wari-colored granite cut from glacial boulders gathered from the Iowa prairie. The superstructure, or main part of the building, is of bluff colored sandstone from quarries along the Mississippi River in Missouri.

Both front and back porticoes have pediments supported by six Corinthian columns each. The pediment over the front entrance discloses a fine piece of allegorical sculpture.

The commanding feature is the central towering dome constructed of iron and brick and covered with tissue-paper thin sheets of pure 23-carat gold. There is a protective layer sealing the gold from the weather. The gold leafing was replaced in 1964–1965 at a cost of $79,938. The most recent regilding of the dome was carried out from 1998 to 1999, at a cost of about $482,000. The dome is surmounted by a lookout lantern that may be reached by long and winding stairs, and it terminates in a finial that is above the ground floor. From its opening during 1884 until 1924, it was the tallest building in Des Moines, and likely the entire state. The rotunda beneath the dome is in diameter. Four smaller domes of simple design rise from the four corners of the Capitol.

==Interior==
The beauty, dignity, and arrangement of the interior become apparent as a visitor stands under the dome of the first floor. Broad, lofty corridors extend west, north, and south. Walls are highly decorated and the rooms and chambers of the capitol have a wide variety of Iowa wood as well as imported marble. Twenty-nine types of imported and domestic marble were used in the interior; and the wood used—walnut, cherry, catalpa, butternut, and oak—was nearly all from Iowa forests.

The marble grand staircase between the second and third floors is to the east and is the focal point of the building. Suites opening from the south corridor are those of the Governor, Auditor of State, and Treasurer of State. The historical Supreme Court Chamber is to the north; the Secretary of State&#x27;s suite is to the west. The grand staircase ascends to a landing and divides north and south to bring visitors to the floor above, where the House of Representatives is on the north, the Senate is on the south side, and the Law Library on the west. The Victorian-styled Law Library features four stories of balcony shelves surrounding a central atrium and is open to the public on weekdays.

The ground floor houses a cafeteria and administrative offices.

===Art===

Around the rotunda on the frieze above the columns is the famous quotation from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address: &quot;This nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot;

Extending the full width of the east wall over the staircase is the great mural painting &quot;Westward&quot;, an idealized representation of the coming of the people who made Iowa. The painting was completed shortly after the start of the 20th century. Edwin H. Blashfield, the artist, wrote of it: &quot;The main idea of the picture is a symbolical presentation of the Pioneers led by the spirits of Civilization and Enlightenment to the conquest by cultivation of the Great West.&quot;

In the central rotunda, suspended beneath the ceiling on wires is a very large banner of the insignia of the Grand Army of the Republic, which between 1894 and 1953 had a room in the state capitol dedicated for their use. They are the only non-state agency to have ever occupied space in the capitol.

===Displays===
The battle flags carried by the Iowa regiments in various wars are preserved in niches on the main floor: Civil War, 1; Spanish–American War, 13; World War I, 26. In the west hall is a plaque done by Nellie V. Walker in commemoration of the work of Iowa women in the fight for political equality and a memorial to those Iowans killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

Also in the west hall is a model of the battleship on loan from the U.S. Department of the Navy. The model is long and weighs about . It is a perfect 1:48 scale model, with  inch equaling 1 foot. The &quot;Iowa&quot; was the lead ship of her class of battleship and the fourth in the United States Navy to be named in honor of the 29th state. It is also the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships, and was the only ship of her class to have served in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. On July 7, 2012, the retired &quot;Iowa&quot; opened to the public as a floating educational and naval museum at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, California.

In the south hall across from the Governor&#x27;s office is a collection of porcelain dolls representing the 41 Iowa First Ladies in miniature replicas of their inaugural gowns. Where actual descriptions of the gowns could not be found, they are typical of the period. As future First Ladies take their place, they, too, will be represented.

A two-week display of Baphomet and the seven tenets of the Satanic Temple was set up, with official approval, in the Iowa Capitol in December 2023. This drew criticism from Republican politicians. After the display was ruined, a failed Republican candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives was charged with criminal mischief for allegedly vandalizing the display.

<doc id="1213546" wikidata="Q4024135" url="?curid=1213546" title="Zen Guerrilla">
<text>Zen Guerrilla was a rock band originally from Newark, Delaware and later based in San Francisco, California. Musically, the band evolved over their career. Their early sound was characterized by psychedelic elements, such as delayed guitars and noise washes. Their unique sound gained a growing local following (winning several Philly music awards), however, did not increase marketability. Later, Zen Guerrilla fused blues, rock and gospel to create a sound which could be likened to bands such as the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

==History==
Zen Guerrilla formed in Newark, Delaware, in the late 1980s. Band members Andy Duvall (drums), Marcus Durant (vocals/harmonica), Carl Horne (bass), Daniel McMullen (keyboard), and Rich Millman (guitar) came together from local bands Marcus Hook, the Gollywogs, Stone Groove, and No Comment.

Their early sound was characterized by psychedelic elements, such as delayed guitars and noise washes played by The Sloth (before leaving the band in 1991). This unique sound gained a growing local following (their first two color vinyl 45s winning several Philly music awards), while avoiding increased marketability.

Later, the band released their self-titled CD on Philadelphia-based Compulsiv Records in 1992 and recorded at the world-famous Third Story Recording Studio in Walnut Hill with producer/engineer, Scott Herzog. Soon after, Zen Guerrilla moved to Philadelphia and were regular performers around the city at clubs such as the Khyber Pass Pub. Around this time the band began a heavy touring schedule, which would have them cross the country multiple times through the end of the decade.

Zen Guerrilla relocated to San Francisco in 1994. Their constant touring increased their exposure, and, combined with their explosive live show, helped to release albums first with Alternative Tentacles and later Sub Pop, which is known for being the original record company of Nirvana.

The band&#x27;s version of the song &quot;Empty Heart&quot; was featured in the 2000 PlayStation game &quot;Grind Session&quot;.

The band dissolved sometime around 2003.

<doc id="1213554" wikidata="Q5328102" url="?curid=1213554" title="East Coast Bays">
<text>East Coast Bays is a string of small suburbs that form the northernmost part of the North Shore, part of the contiguous Auckland metropolitan area in New Zealand. The suburbs line the north-east coast of the city along the shore of the Hauraki Gulf and Rangitoto Channel. They include, from north to south, Long Bay, Torbay, Waiake Bay, Browns Bay, Rothesay Bay, Murrays Bay, Mairangi Bay, Campbells Bay and Castor Bay. Most of the East Coast Bays are covered under the East Coast Bays subdivision of the Hibiscus and Bays local board area.

==Definition and etymology==

The East Coast Bays is a stretch of coastline in the North Shore of Auckland along the Hauraki Gulf, from Long Bay in the north to Castor Bay in the south. Milford and Takapuna to the south are occasionally included in the definition. The first uses of East Coast Bays from the 1870s referred to the eastern coast of the North Island. The first references to East Coast Bays as an area of the North Shore come from the latter 1920s.

==Geography==
The East Coast Bays area begins at the Ōkura River and Karepiro Bay in the north, starting from Long Bay Regional Park. In the south, the mouth of the Wairau Creek forms the border between Castor Bay and Milford.

The East Coast Bays are primarily formed from Waitemata Group sandstone, which accumulated on the sea floor during the early Miocene era, between 22 and 16 million years ago, and uplifted due to tectonic forces. The sedimentary layers of the Waitemata sandstone can be clearly seen in the cliff faces along the bays. Basement rocks in the area are greywacke and argillite, and a number of the headlands of the East Coast Bays are formed from harder Parnell grit rocks, produced by lahars during the Miocene.

Prior to human settlement, the inland East Coast Bays area was primarily a northern broadleaf podocarp forest, dominated by kauri, tōtara, mataī, miro, kauri and kahikatea trees. Pōhutukawa trees were a major feature of the coastline. By the 19th century, the area was primarily scrubland, vegetated by plants such as mānuka, tutu and harakeke flax. An area of Torbay, the Awaruku Bush Reserve, is a remnant kahikatea forest, with the oldest trees in the reserve estimated to be over 650 years old.

==History==
===Māori history===
Māori settlement of the Auckland Region began around the 13th or 14th centuries. The North Shore was settled by Tāmaki Māori, including people descended from the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe and ancestors of figures such as Taikehu and Peretū. During his arrival in New Zealand, Hoturoa, captain of the &quot;Tainui&quot;, guided the waka to the Waiake Lagoon (Deep Creek), which was a safe anchorage for the canoe.

Many of the early Tāmaki Māori people of the North Shore identified as Ngā Oho. While the poor soils of the East Coast Bays area was a barrier to agriculture and settlement, Long Bay was one of the three most densely settled areas of the North Shore, and the area features extensive archaeological sites. Long Bay was a focal point for transport in the wider area, with many (overland paths) connecting Long Bay to Ōkura over the cliffs, and to Oteha and the Lukas Creek in Albany to the south-west.

Many of the headlands of East Coast Bays were sites for defensive pā, including at Torbay, Ōmangaia between Waiake and Browns Bay, and Rahopara at Castor Bay. Outside of Long Bay, most areas of the East Coast Bays were utilised for seasonal resources.

The warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region, likely sometime in the 17th century. Maki conquered and unified many the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore.

After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū. His sons Manuhiri and Maraeariki settled the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast. Maraeariki&#x27;s daughter Kahu succeeded him, and she is both the namesake of the North Shore, (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;), and the beach and bay of Long Bay, (&quot;The Long Beach of Kahu&quot;). Many of the iwi of the North Shore, including Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Poataniwha, Ngāi Tai Ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Whātua, can trace their lineage to Kahu. 

By the 18th century, the Marutūāhu iwi Ngāti Paoa had expanded their influence to include the islands of the Hauraki Gulf and the North Shore. After periods of conflict, peace had been reached by the 1790s. The earliest contact with Europeans began in the late 18th century, which caused many Tāmaki Māori to die of , respiratory diseases. During the early 1820s, most Māori of the North Shore fled for the Waikato or Northland due to the threat of war parties during the Musket Wars. Most people had returned by the 1830s, and remained at Te Oneroa until the 1850s.

===Early European settlement===
The first Europeans to visit the area were timber merchants and kauri gum diggers in the 1830s, and large gum digger camps were established at Murrays Bay and Campbells Bay. In 1841, the Crown purchased the Mahurangi and Omaha blocks; an area that spanned from Takapuna to Te Ārai. The purchase involved some iwi with customary interests in the area, such as Ngāti Paoa, other Marutūāhu iwi and Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, but not others, such as Te Kawerau ā Maki or Ngāti Rango. The Crown spent until 1873 rectifying this sale, by making further deals with stakeholders.

The first permanent settlers arrived in East Coast Bays in the 1850s. John Logan Campbell purchased the majority of the East Coast Bays in 1864 (Allotment 189, area spanning from Ōkura to Browns Bay), believing that there was coal in the area. The East Coast Bays were seen as an unproductive area for agriculture, and Campbell sold the land, with much of the area becoming dairy farms. Major figures in the latter 19th century include the Vaughan family, who ran a sheep and cattle farm for over 100 years at Long Bay, Captain Charles Cholmondeley-Smith, whose established a sawmill, flaxmill and vineyard at Torbay, Peter Brown at Browns Bay, and English settler Thomas Murray, who farmed Murrays and Mairangi bays.

The East Coast Bays became popular vacation destinations in the 1910s and 1920s. Visitors primarily arrived by steam ships, and the southern East Coast Bays area began to develop after the Milford to Bayswater tram improved access. Until the 1930s, the majority of houses constructed in the bays were holiday baches.

During World War II, the coast from Torbay south was fortified with defenses, including pillboxes along the coastline and hills, and barbed wire ditches. The largest fortification in East Coast Bays was the Castor Bay Battery and Camp, which was disguised as a state housing project.

===Independent borough and city===
After the end of World War II, local residents lobbied for the creation of an East Coast Bays borough, separate from Waitemata County. The borough was established in April 1954 with approximately 7,000 residents, and included the area between Torbay to Campbells Bay, excluding Long Bay and Castor Bay. The borough council immediately began working on roading projects to better connect the bays to Auckland, and worked to improve water mains, sewerage, drainage, refuse collection and created a library service. Browns Bay became the administrative and commercial centre of the East Coast Bays Borough, and smaller shopping centres grew in Mairangi Bay and Torbay. In 1959, the Auckland Harbour Bridge was constructed, which led to massive growth in the area, with the area transitioning away from isolated holiday communities and becoming commuter suburbs for Auckland. By 1966, the population had doubled to 12,000 people, increasing to 16,000 by 1971. Between 1971 and 1975, East Coast Bays was the fastest growing area of Auckland, seeing a population increase of 47.3%. This led to the opening of additional facilities such as Long Bay College, and in 1975, the East Coast Bays had grown in size enough that the borough became a city. Over 3,000 dwellings were constructed between 1976 and 1986.

Long Bay Regional Park was opened by the Auckland Regional Council in the early 1970s, becoming one of the first regional parks in Auckland. In 1973, community groups including the Taiorahi Wilderness Committee and Deep Creek Valley Bush Society were established, to oppose the development of suburban housing in native bush areas.

By 1986 the population had reached 31,000. The city was merged into the wider North Shore City in 1989.

===Further development===

Long Bay began to develop housing in the 1990s, due to zoning law changes. In the early 1990s, Browns Bay Mall was opened.

==Education==

The first school in the East Coast Bays was Browns Bay School, established in 1888. This was followed by Campbells Bay Primary School, which opened in August 1925. Population growth in the East Coast Bays area led to the construction of new schools, including Torbay Primary School, Murrays Bay Primary and Intermediate schools, and Rangitoto College. Rangitoto College grew to become the largest secondary school in New Zealand.

St John&#x27;s School was the first Catholic school established in the East Coast Bays area, and was established in Mairangi Bay in 1961. The secular Mairangi Bay School followed soon after in 1967. Long Bay College is a secondary school that opened in 1975. Three further primary schools were established in the 1970s: Glamorgan School in Torbay in 1972, Sherwood School in Browns Bay (1976) and Long Bay Primary School (1979).

In 1973, Kristin School was established at the former Methodist Health Camp in Campbells Bay. As the school grew rapidly, a new campus was opened in Albany in 1978. The Corelli International Academic School of the Arts was a private composite (years 1–13) school which ran specialist programs in visual arts, music, drama and dance as well as the general curriculum. It opened in 2001, and went into receivership in 2016.

== Politics ==

From 1876 until 1954, the area was administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1954, most of the area split from the county, forming the East Coast Bays Borough, and Castor Bay became a part of the Borough of Takapuna (Takapuna City from 1961). For the next twenty years, Long Bay remained a part of the Waitemata County. In 1974 the county was dissolved, and Long Bay became a rural area incorporated into Takapuna City. 

In 1975, the population of the East Coast Bays had increased enough that it became the East Coast Bays City. In 1989, East Coast Bays City, Takapuna City and the surrounding areas were amalgamated to form North Shore City. North Shore City was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, the majority of East Coast Bays is a part of the Hibiscus and Bays local government area governed by the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board. It is a part of the Albany ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council. This area is defined as the East Coast Bays subdivision of the Hibiscus and Bays local board area by Auckland Council. The southernmost of the bays, Castor Bay, is a part of the Devonport-Takapuna local government area governed by the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board. It is a part of the North Shore ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

East Coast Bays is also the name of an electorate from which an MP is elected to serve in the New Zealand Parliament, which first formed in 1972. Its current MP is Erica Stanford.

<text>James Burkett Hartle (August 17, 1939 – May 17, 2023) was an American theoretical physicist. He joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1966, and was a member of the external faculty of the Santa Fe Institute. Hartle is known for his work in general relativity, astrophysics, and interpretation of quantum mechanics.

== Early life ==
Hartle was born on August 17, 1939, in Baltimore to Anna Elizabeth Burkett and Charles James Hartle. He began as an engineering major upon entering Princeton, but switched to physics due to the influence of John Wheeler.

Hartle completed his AB at Princeton University in 1960 and his Ph.D. in particle physics under Murray Gell-Mann in 1964.

==Work==
In collaboration with Gell-Mann and others, Hartle developed an alternative to the standard Copenhagen interpretation, more general and appropriate to quantum cosmology, based on consistent histories.

With Dieter Brill in 1964, he discovered the Brill–Hartle geon, an approximate solution realizing Wheeler&#x27;s suggestion of a hypothetical phenomenon in which a gravitational wave packet is confined to a compact region of spacetime by the gravitational attraction of its own field energy.

With Kip Thorne, Hartle derived from general relativity the laws of motion and precession of black holes and other relativistic bodies, including the influence of the coupling of their multipole moments to the spacetime curvature of nearby objects, as well as writing down the Hartle–Thorne metric, an approximate solution which describes the exterior of a slowly and rigidly rotating, stationary and axially symmetric body.

Working at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago in 1983, he developed the Hartle–Hawking wavefunction of the Universe in collaboration with Stephen Hawking. This specific solution to the Wheeler–deWitt equation is meant to explain the initial conditions of the Big Bang cosmology.

Hartle&#x27;s textbook on general relativity, &quot;Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein&#x27;s General Relativity&quot;, was published in 2003. It has been praised for its lucid explanations and focus on physical insight rather than mathematical details.

Hartle was a founder of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics and served as its director from 1995 to 1997.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2016. He also was an American Physical Society Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He received the 2009 APS Einstein Prize for his &quot;broad range of fundamental contributions to relativistic stars, quantum fields in curved spacetime, and especially quantum cosmology.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Hartle married Mary Jo Wheeler in 1984, the niece of John Wheeler.

Hartle was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2022. He died in Zurich, Switzerland on May 17, 2023, at the age of 83.

<text>Quantum cosmology is the attempt in theoretical physics to develop a quantum theory of the universe. This approach attempts to answer open questions of classical physical cosmology, particularly those related to the first phases of the universe.

Classical cosmology is based on Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity (GTR or simply GR) which describes the evolution of the universe very well, as long as you do not approach the Big Bang. It is the gravitational singularity and the Planck time where relativity theory fails to provide what must be demanded of a final theory of space and time. Therefore, a theory is needed that integrates relativity theory and quantum theory. Such an approach is attempted for instance with loop quantum cosmology, loop quantum gravity, string theory and causal set theory.

In quantum cosmology, the universe is treated as a wave function instead of classical spacetime.

<text>Interdom (Ivanovo International Boarding School) is a special school for foreigners located in the city of Ivanovo in Russia. The name is an abbreviation of the Russian &quot;internatzionalny dom&quot; or &quot;International House&quot;.

==History==
The idea for the school of this type was put forth by a Swiss activist, Mentona Moser, and she donated part of her inheritance towards the school. Initially it was set near Podolsk in the village of Vaskino, and it was finished in 1929 but in 1933 a new building was constructed, financed by the textile women of Ivanovo under the patronage of the Soviet section of International Red Aid (also known as МОPR, its Russian acronym). The new building was designed in the constructivist style, floorplanned as the hammer and sickle. The boarding school was later named after founder Elena Dmitrievna Stasova. It was conceived as a school for children of repressed democratic leaders and activists from all over the world.

About 5,000 children from 85 countries attended the school. Interdom also became home for many children victims of the World War II Siege of Leningrad and of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

At the beginning of the 21st century plans to transform the international school into a military academy for cadets (see Suvorov Military School) were successfully blocked after the children staged a hunger strike and wrote a letter to President Vladimir Putin. It lost its &quot;international&quot; status, but the association of the graduates successfully appealed to restore it and now the official name of the school is «Международная школа «Интердом» имени Е.Д. Стасовой» under the aegis of the federal state enterprise &quot;Центр международного сотрудничества Министерства просвещения Российской Федерации&quot;

<text>Roland Omnès (18 February 1931 – 2 August 2022) was a French physicist and author of several books that aimed to give non-scientists the information required to understand quantum mechanics.

== Biography ==
Omnès was Professor Emeritus of Theoretical Physics in the Faculté des Sciences at Orsay, at the Université Paris-Sud XI. He was instrumental in developing consistent histories and quantum decoherence approaches in quantum mechanics. He received the Paul-Langevin Prize in 1959.

Omnès died in Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse on 2 August 2022, at the age of 91.

== Philosophical work ==
In his philosophical work (especially in &quot;Quantum Philosophy&quot;), Omnès argues that:

# &quot;Until modern times, intuitive, rational thought was sufficient to describe the world; mathematics remained an adjunct, simply helping to make our intuitive descriptions more precise.&quot;
# &quot;In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, we arrived at a Fracture between common sense and our best descriptions of reality. Our formal description became the truest picture (most consistent with how things are, experimentally) and common sense was left behind. Our best descriptions of reality are now incomprehensible to common sense alone, and our intuitions about how things are often negated by experiment and theory.&quot;
# &quot;However it is, finally, possible to recover common sense from our formal, mathematical description of reality. We can now demonstrate that the laws of classical logic, classical probability, and classical dynamics (of common sense, in fact) apply at the macroscopic level, even in a world described by a single, unitary wavefunction. This follows from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, with no need for extra logical constructs such as wave function collapse.&quot;

&quot;We will never&quot;, Omnès believed, &quot;find a common sense interpretation of quantum law itself. Nevertheless, it is now possible to see that common sense and quantum reality are compatible with each other: we can enter the world at either starting point, and we will find that each leads to the other: experiment leads to theory, and the theory can now recover the common sense framework in which the experiment was conducted (and in which our lives are lived).&quot;

== The new &#x27;Copenhagen Interpretation&#x27;? ==
Omnès&#x27;s work is sometimes described as an update to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. This is somewhat misleading. The relationship between the two accounts is as follows:

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (argued for most centrally by Niels Bohr) advises that physicists &quot;shut up and calculate&quot;. It holds that some questions are unanswerable, and that there are inexplicable rules that reconcile the quantum description of reality (which is experimentally correct to at least 10 decimal places of accuracy) with human-observed reality (which seems self-evidently correct, and yet is apparently in contradiction with quantum law).

Omnès claimed that there is a self-consistent framework that enables recovering the principles of classical common sense—and knowing, precisely, their limits—starting from fundamental quantum law.

== Bibliography ==
The work Omnès presents in his books was developed by Omnès himself, Robert B. Griffiths, Murray Gell-Mann, James Hartle, and others.

<doc id="1213595" wikidata="Q179102" url="?curid=1213595" title="Bagi, the Monster of Mighty Nature">
<text>is a Japanese anime film that premiered on the Nippon Television network on August 19, 1984. It was written by Osamu Tezuka as a critique of the Japanese government&#x27;s approval of recombinant DNA research that year. The film was streamed by Anime Sols as part of a crowdfunding campaign in 2013, and by RetroCrush in 2020.

==Synopsis==
Deep in the South American jungle, a 20-year-old Japanese hunter named Ryosuke (&quot;Ryo&quot; for short), and a local boy named Chico, stalk a monster that has been terrorizing the local countryside. Ryosuke, however, is quite familiar with this beast, and the story flashes back to his childhood.

5 years ago, 15-year-old Ryosuke Ishigami, the delinquent son of a crime reporter and a geneticist, is out with a motorcycle gang when they encounter a mysterious woman. Some of the rougher members of the gang accost her, and she turns out to be anything but normal, landing the gang with serious injuries. The gang leader returns to the woman&#x27;s hideout for revenge, but the gang members are torn apart, except for Ryosuke.

The woman, named Bagi, turns out to be a &quot;cat-woman&quot; – a cross between a human and a mountain lion. She recognizes Ryosuke as the boy who had rescued her and raised her as a kitten when he was 6 years old. As Bagi grew and people became suspicious of the precocious &quot;cat&quot;, who was able to walk on her hind legs and even learned to write her own name and speak, she escaped and grew to adulthood on her own for the next 9 years.

Upon their reunion, Ryosuke and Bagi join forces to find out the truth of her origins. Ryosuke&#x27;s own mother is found responsible for Bagi&#x27;s creation — Bagi is a product of recombinant DNA research between human and mountain lion cells. They then follow Ryosuke&#x27;s mother to South America to confront her about the reason for Bagi&#x27;s existence, but find a far greater peril. The officials in charge of the laboratories there are creating a strain of rice that has the potential to destroy humanity. Ryosuke&#x27;s mother sacrifices her life to have Bagi destroy the &quot;Rice Ball&quot; and Ryosuke mistakenly pins the blame on Bagi, vowing revenge.

Meanwhile, Bagi is quickly losing her human traits and becomes extremely feral, attacking any humans that come near. Ryosuke catches up to her and stabs her when she attacks, but then finds a hand-written note held in a locket around her neck. He reads his mother&#x27;s last words, expressing remorse for being both a bad scientist and a bad mother, and Ryosuke realizes his mistake and is filled with regret. He returns to the site the next morning to find Bagi&#x27;s body gone, a set of footprints leading off to the distant mountains, meaning that Bagi has survived the stabbing and run off. He prays for Bagi to live on in solitude, far away from mankind. In the final shot, the silhouette of Bagi is seen running for parts unknown.

==Characters==
;Ryo / Ryosuke Ishigami
:A young Japanese man. His father is a crime reporter, and his mother, Prof. Ishigami, works in a laboratory without mentioning much about it not coming home often. Believing he doesn&#x27;t have much to live for, he joins a biker gang. He reunites with Bagi on his 15th birthday and becomes a hunter five years later. Bagi was his &quot;pet&quot; when she was not yet fully grown.
;Chiko / Chico
:A Mexican boy who suspects that Bagi killed his father and seeks revenge. He meets Ryo and helps him track down Bagi in the nearby wilderness. He wears a sombrero and is skilled in the use of bolas.
;Bagi
:A creature genetically modified to contain both human and feline DNA (her specific origins are not disclosed in the story). Bagi and her mother were the only survivors of an animal outbreak at the SuperLife Center, though her mother was eventually hunted down. Bagi wandered as a kitten until she met Ryo and became his &quot;pet cat&quot;. As she grew and developed human characteristics and intelligence, she was forced to leave and disguised herself as a human girl, searching for more of her own kind until she meets Ryo again.
;Prof. Yoko Ishigami
:Ryo&#x27;s mother and a leading research professor at the SuperLife Center. She believes that anything can be improved with science. She is responsible for the creation of Bagi and others like her. After the President coerces her to mass-produce poisonous &quot;rice balls&quot;, she is overwhelmed with guilt and arranges to have Bagi destroy the rice balls. She is killed in the process, and Ryo mistakenly blames Bagi. Her last letter to Ryo expresses remorse for being a bad scientist and a bad mother.
;The Chief
:The man in charge of the SuperLife Center, who is cunning and ambitious. He has a short, almost comical stature (possibly from dwarfism) with long hair that sticks up in a fashion similar to that of Albert Einstein and a small moustache similar to that of Adolf Hitler. He explains Bagi&#x27;s origins after she and Ryo infiltrate the Center, then is hypnotized into arranging transport for them to South America to meet with Professor Ishigami.
;Colonel Sado
:The head of the Imperial Guards of Monica. He mistakes Ryo and a driver for rebels after Ryo and Bagi hijack a circus truck. After making Bagi perform a jump through a thirty-meter flaming coil (under threat of execution), he knocks Bagi and Ryo out and takes them to the Cucaracha Research Lab without their knowledge. He&#x27;s seen again with the President as he and Professor Ishigami discuss the change in the genetically-engineered rice before they found out it had a strong poison in it. When Ryo tried to escape, Sado attempted to start a sword fight with him. This leads to doing so on a pair of bikes. Sado meets his possible end when he falls off the tower of the Research Lab. It is also possible that he may have survived.
;The President of Monica
:The malevolent president of the South American country where the Cucaracha Research Lab is located, he is rather heavyset and dresses in gaudy attire, including a robe that appears to be made from dyed animal tails. He comes to inspect the work being done at the Research Lab, and then gets the idea to use a poisonous genetically-engineered rice created there to eliminate guerrilla rebels that have been opposing his government for years, as well as anyone else who opposes him. When Prof. Ishigami refuses to cooperate with his plan, he has her killed by his attack dogs. His plans are ultimately defeated thanks to Bagi and Ryo, Bagi escaping the lab with the only samples of the rice while Ryo destroyed the lab.
;Cemen Bond
:The man responsible for keeping Ryo in custody at the Cucaracha Research Lab, known for his remarkable marksmanship. His decisions solely depend on coin flipping. Following Ryo&#x27;s escape from the Research Lab, he is fired and then agrees to teach the boy everything he knows about shooting. He appears to be a loose parody of James Bond, evidenced by his last name and music that plays during most of his appearances.

<doc id="1213600" wikidata="Q4810540" url="?curid=1213600" title="Marios Matsakis">
<text>Marios Matsakis (born 2 August 1954) is a Greek-Cypriot doctor, coroner, forensic pathologist, and politician who served as Member of the European Parliament and Member of the House of Representatives for the Democratic Party from 2004 to 2009. He has been noted for his controversial statements and beliefs.

==Early life==

Matsakis was born on 2 August 1954 in Limassol, which was then under the control of British Cyprus. He graduated from the University of London in 1976 with a BSc in microbiology and was awarded a PhD in biochemistry in 1981. He gained his medical degree from the University of Cambridge in 1984, and specialised in forensic medicine at the University of Glasgow, where he was awarded an MPhil in 1992. He then moved to Greece, where he continued his studies in forensic pathology. He returned to Cyprus in 1994. He initially assumed a position in the medical field, but soon became interested in politics and was elected as an MP in 1996.

==Career==
In the European Parliament, Matsakis sat with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. He became involved in politics in the mid-1990s, and served as Member of the European Parliament and Member of the House of Representatives for the Democratic Party from 2004 to 2009. He ran for president in the 2008 Cypriot presidential elections, coming in fourth place with 0.77% of the national vote. He voted against what would later become Cyprus&#x27; universal healthcare service. During the 2019 Ayia Napa rape case, he testified that the victim had indeed been raped and that the rape kit exam presented in court as evidence was &quot;incomplete&quot;. He disagreed with state pathologist Sophocles Sophocleous&#x27; conclusion that the victim bore no physical signs consistent with a serious sexual assault, telling the court that both the report&#x27;s findings as well as special DNA tests and photographs were &quot;consistent with the rape taking place&quot; and that &quot;violence was exercised&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Reputation===
Matsakis has been noted for his controversial beliefs and false claims. In a 2020 interview, he claimed to have been arrested seven times by British authorities and three times by Turkish authorities. In the same interview, he said that &quot;the vast majority&quot; of his fellow Cypriots are &quot;stupid cowards&quot; who only care about &quot;what they&#x27;re going to eat [and] how many cars they&#x27;re going to have&quot;.

===Smuggling claims===
On 30 October 2005, it was reported that Matsakis&#x27; home in Pyrga had been raided twice during the week by police and CID officials, accusing him of smuggling antiquities. He reportedly had &quot;enough chests, amphoras and other artefacts for three antique stores&quot;. The first raid took place on 23 October 2005. Matsakis could be prosecuted under Cypriot law, as the European Parliament lifted his immunity earlier in the month. He was also charged with attempts to blackmail a drug squad officer in an unrelated case. Police officials found more than 110 chests and hundreds of Grecian urns on his property. Matsakis protested his innocence, stating, &quot;It looks like some people do not want my voice to be heard in Cyprus or Europe.&quot;

It was reported on 22 August 2007 that all cases against Matsakis had collapsed and that he had been cleared. He called for an independent inquiry to examine possible police corruption, and to identify suspected political motives for the initiation of the whole affair, which started only three days after he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament. After two years, authorities returned 250 items that were confiscated from his home. The Attorney General of Cyprus, after studying the case, decided that no charge could be brought against Matsakis and all items seized from his home were to be returned to him.

===Racism and homophobia===
In 2008, Matsakis asked not to be sent &quot;offensive&quot; emails by fellow MEPs. The emails were invitations to the European Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Different Families, Same Love&quot; exhibition, which showcased LGBT and mixed race families. He also complained to the president of the European Parliament about posters for the exhibition being stuck up near his office. LGBT activists in Cyprus pointed out Matsakis&#x27; hypocrisy regarding his stance against &quot;non-normal&quot; families, as his family situation included a child out of wedlock despite his Greek Orthodox beliefs. While participating on the talk show &quot;Tolmo&quot; in 2012, Matsakis claimed that &quot;homosexuality is not normal&quot; yet asserted that there is no homophobia in Cyprus, despite several studies by multiple organisations concluding that Cyprus is one of the most homophobic nations in Europe.

===COVID-19 misinformation===
Matsakis has been criticised for spreading misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, downplaying the severity of the virus, sharing false claims about COVID-19 vaccines, and attributing COVID-19 deaths to other causes. His views on the pandemic were shared primarily through his Facebook page and the &quot;Cyprus Mail&quot; newspaper. He claimed to take these avenues because mainstream media outlets refused to give him a platform, and stated that he does not trust the WHO. In 2020, he called for the Cypriot government to immediately lift its &quot;fascist restrictions&quot; and end its lockdown, which he described as &quot;extreme&quot; and a &quot;hysterical response&quot;. He also falsely claimed that the virus has killed fewer people than the flu and that &quot;it is now obvious that the coronavirus pandemic is ending&quot;.

<text>Attila Gábor Csihar (; born 29 March 1971), also sometimes known as Void, is a Hungarian extreme metal vocalist, best known for his vocal work in Norwegian black metal band Mayhem and American drone metal band Sunn O))). Author Ian Christe describes his vocals as &quot;operatic&quot;.
== Biography ==

His music career began in 1985 with the Hungarian metal band Tormentor, which reached cult status in black metal circles with their first album, &quot;Anno Domini&quot; (1988). Tormentor performed 50-100 live shows between 1986 and 1990 and became one of the most infamous bands in Hungary. After Tormentor he started his dark electro industrial band Plasma Pool (1990–1994). On the strength of his work in Tormentor, he was invited to perform vocals on the &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; album by Norwegian black metal band Mayhem after lead singer Dead committed suicide. His groundbreaking new way of singing added a special character to Mayhem&#x27;s sound. Ultimately Csihar did not perform any live concerts with the band until his second tenure in 2004.

After Mayhem, Csihar continued to work in various bands, such as Plasma Pool, Aborym, and Korog; he also performed as Caiaphas in the rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in Hungary. He stated during an interview for Hungarian Metal Hammer that he felt honoured to sing &quot;This Jesus Must Die&quot;. He performed in Keep of Kalessin as well on their returning EP &quot;Reclaim&quot; together with drummer Frost from Satyricon.

He is a &quot;shadow&quot; member of the American doom/drone metal band Sunn O))). His first live performance with the band happened on 24 March 2003 at Stadtwerkstatt in Linz, Austria. His first recorded collaboration with the band was in 2004 when he sang in the Sanskrit language on the tracks &quot;&quot;Decay2 [Nihil&#x27;s Maw]&quot; and &quot;Decay (The Symptoms of Kali Yuga)&quot;&quot; on their album &quot;White2&quot;. Csihar has performed on five full-length albums with the group, including the acclaimed successful &quot;Monoliths &amp; Dimensions&quot;, and performed live with the band hundreds of times around the world.

In 2004, Csihar rejoined Mayhem after the departure of Maniac, the band&#x27;s previous vocalist. Their 2007 album, &quot;Ordo ad Chao&quot;, won the Spellemannprisen (also known as the Norwegian Grammy). Since then the band has embarked upon intense international touring.

In 2008 he also joined another project, Gravetemple with Stephen O&#x27;Malley of Sunn O))) and Oren Ambarchi.

Csihar started his solo act in November 2008, called Void ov Voices. His live performances have been in support of artists like Ulver on their first European tour, Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore, Lustmord, Ruin and Diamanda Galas. He performed at &quot;The Grand Reincarnation&quot; Of Paul Booth&#x27;s Last Rites Gallery &amp; Tattoo Theatre. He also toured in Japan and performed in Australia for the Dark Mofo festival in Hobart, Tasmania.

He has collaborated with artists such as Current 93, Jarboe, Dissection, Emperor, Taake, Ulver, and Banks Violette.

Between 2016 and 2018, Csihar joined blackened death metal supergroup Sinsaenum. He would perform lead vocals alongside Sean Zatorsky of Dååth, with ex-DragonForce bassist and group founder Frédéric Leclercq and Loudblast guitarist Stéphane Buriez on guitars, Seth guitarist Heimoth on bass, and former Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison on drums. The band released its debut album &quot;Echoes of the Tortured&quot; on 29 July 2016 via earMUSIC.

In 2019 he formed an esoteric noise project called Hiedelem with drummer/percussionist Balázs Pándi (Merzbow, Keiji Haino).

In 2019 he participated in the live presentation of the album Canticles of the Holy Scythe by (Lüüp, among with a chamber orchestra of a total 14 musicians ensemble.

Outside of music, Csihar graduated as an electrical engineer from a technical college, and used to be a private teacher of math and physics.

He worked in film production, most notably on Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Spy Game&quot;, where he was the first assistant of production designer Norris Spencer. In 2018 he was portrayed in the film &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, which depicted the early 90s Norwegian black metal scene (in particular Mayhem). He was portrayed by his son Arion.

Although Mayhem have often displayed dead animals and blood at their live events, Csihar is a vegetarian in his personal life.

<doc id="1213609" wikidata="Q7156897" url="?curid=1213609" title="Paysite">
<text>A paysite or pay site, in the adult entertainment industry, is a website that charges money to become a member and view its content, and often produces original adult content. They can be contrasted with &quot;free-sites&quot;, which do not charge a membership fee. Most paysites offer &quot;free tours&quot; which allow non-members to view a limited number of short trailers. The vast majority of paysite memberships are bought by men. Some of the earliest paysites began by scanning images from pornographic magazines. The number of sites then grew until the market was saturated, and now many thousands of sites cater to every legal pornographic niche.

Because there is free porn available on the Internet (e.g. in the form of thumbnail gallery post (TGP) and streaming video sites, as well as piracy), and some individuals cannot afford to or do not wish to purchase paysite memberships or to give their personal and credit card information to such sites, some consumers of pornography view only free pornography. However, paysites are often one of the main originators of new content; they are one way an administrator can pay for the bandwidth costs and they are one of the most conspicuous ways in the industry to try to turn a profit. Theoretically, the more revenue a site takes in, the higher quality content it can produce.

Payment methods include credit card or checking account billing. Bills routinely appear on statements as transactions under the name of a billing entity with a neutral-sounding company name (ostensibly for discretionary reasons) and may not be readily recognized as paysite billing transactions upon casual perusal of bank statements.

Most paysites prevent unauthorized access to their members area by means of a username and password.

A problem that paysites have is copyright protection, even with well-secured sites: there are cases of so-called &quot;site rips&quot;, i.e. sites are either hacked, or subscribers redistributed content from a members&#x27; area without authorization; there have thus been sightings of original content on other TGP sites or entire site rip archives on file sharing networks. Some sites sell site rips of paysites. Administrators may try to counter these problems by employing digital rights management technologies.

Because members must confirm some details of their identity when they make their payment, a touted advantage of paysites is the potential to keep minors from viewing their content, which, in several jurisdictions, including the United States, is illegal. The issue of how to protect these Internet audiences from pornographic material deemed harmful to them has been widely debated in the U.S. in light of the 1998 federal Child Online Protection Act, although websites hosted in the United States are required by law to publish contact information for the custodian of records.

Many paysites attract potential paying customers by providing a portion of their content for free via free hosted galleries (FHGs), and use an affiliate program to drive new traffic to those FHGs. The percentage of unique visitors to FHGs who become paying members is known as the &quot;conversion ratio&quot;.

With so many paysites and so much free porn being readily available the pricing of many paysites has dropped in recent years to increase subscriptions. This has seen the rise of discount sites that offer reduced price memberships to a variety of paysites. Paysites have also increased the quality of their content to attract memberships, with many now offering 4K videos to their members.

<text>Joseph de Marliave (16 November 1873 – 24 August 1914) was a French musicologist. He is best known for his book on Beethoven&#x27;s string quartets, which was the most widely read and quoted book on the subject prior to Joseph Kerman&#x27;s 1966 book &quot;The Beethoven Quartets&quot;.

In addition to his work on Beethoven, he published numerous essays on other composers. Some of his book on Beethoven was a translation and paraphrase of the 1885 book in German by Theodor Helm.

Marliave was a close friend of Gabriel Fauré, who wrote the preface to the original French edition of the book on the Beethoven quartets.

Marliave was also a captain in the French army, and he was killed in action in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the World War I. Maurice Ravel memorialized him in his &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot;, dedicating the closing Toccata to him (the sixth part of the piano version, but absent in the orchestral arrangement).

Marliave was the husband of the famous French pianist Marguerite Long (1874–1966).

<text>Central or Middle Bavarian form a subgroup of Bavarian dialects in large parts of Austria and the German state of Bavaria along the Danube river, on the northern side of the Eastern Alps. They are spoken in the &#x27;Old Bavarian&#x27; regions of Upper Bavaria (with Munich (see Munich German)), Lower Bavaria and in the adjacent parts of the Upper Palatinate region around Regensburg, in Upper and Lower Austria, in Vienna (see Viennese German), in the state of Salzburg, as well as in the northern and eastern parts of Styria and Burgenland. Before 1945 and the expulsions of the Germans, it was also spoken in Hungary and southern Bohemia and Moravia.
It also influenced Austrian German.

==Differences==
There are noticeable differences in the language within the group, but changes occur along a west-east dialect continuum on both sides of the historic border of the Bavarian stem duchy with the later Duchy of Austria. That means that the distinct languages of Vienna and Munich are very different from each other, but the dialects of any two neighbouring towns in between will be quite similar. However, due to influences of the corresponding political centres, discontinuous change is nowadays noticeable along the national border between Austria and Germany.
Generally, Viennese has some characteristics differentiating it from other Bavarian dialects due to the influence of languages spoken by people moving to Vienna from many areas of Austria-Hungary during the 19th century.

==Characteristics==
A characteristic of Central Bavarian is the vocalization of &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; after &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;. E.g. the standard German &quot;viel&quot; becomes either &quot;vui&quot; (in Western Central Bavarian) or &quot;vüü&quot; (in Eastern Central Bavarian).
The border between the western and eastern subgroups roughly coincides with the border between Bavaria and Austria.

In all subgroups, hard consonants such as &quot;p, t, k&quot; are softened to become &quot;b, d, g&quot;.

<doc id="1213617" wikidata="Q115500" url="?curid=1213617" title="Joan Gamper">
<text>Hans Max Gamper-Haessig (; 22 November 1877 – 30 July 1930), commonly known as Joan Gamper (), was a Swiss-born football executive and versatile athlete. He founded football clubs in Switzerland and Spain, most notably Barcelona and Zürich.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the amateur beginnings of Barcelona, being the fundamental head behind the foundation of the club in 1899, and then serving as the club&#x27;s first captain between 1899 and 1903, netting over 100 goals in just 48 matches for Barça and in 1902, he captained his side to a victory in the Copa Macaya, the club&#x27;s first title. He then served as its president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925. One of his main achievements was getting the funds for the construction of their own stadium in 1909, the Camp de la Indústria, which is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s. Under Gamper&#x27;s leadership, Barcelona won eleven Championat de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cup.

== Early years ==
Hans-Max Gamper (his mother&#x27;s maiden name – Haessig – is generally appended in Spanish sources) was born in Winterthur, Switzerland. He was the eldest son and third of five children born to August Gamper and Rosine Emma Haessig. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was eight and the family moved to Zurich. He became a citizen of the city and in his later youth started to learn his craft as a tradesman in an apprenticeship at the silk trade house Grieder at the centrally located Paradeplatz. As a youngster, Gamper was a keen cyclist and runner. In 1893, 15 years old, he was one of the pacers of Swiss champion Edouard Wicky in a match race competition over 100 km (against Gaston Béguin). Throughout his life he was a lover of all sports and, apart from football, he also played rugby union, tennis and golf. In Switzerland, he was highly regarded as a footballer. His first football club was Excelsior Zürich which was playing in the same colours (red and blue) as later Barcelona. After some members of Excelsior split off to form Turicum Zürich, they reunited with Excelsior in 1896 to form FC Zürich. Gamper was a co-founder and the first captain of the club&#x27;s history. In the early years of football in Switzerland, it was allowed to play for an indefinite number of teams from other cities as a guest player in friendly games – Gamper is known to have played among others two games for Winterthur and Basel. Hans Gamper representing Zürich was in 1898 holder of the Swiss records over the 800m and 1600m track distances. He also organized the first international athletics competition in Zürich during autumn of the same year. Today, this event is one of the most renowned international athletics events worldwide, the Weltklasse Zürich (organized by FC Zürich spin-off LC Zürich). In 1897, work took him temporarily to Lyon in France, where he played rugby for Athletique Union. The other names they called him, all came from the difficulty the Catalan people had, pronouncing the German &quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot;: Hans became Kans, Gamper became Kamper. But he is most known as Johannes, becoming Joan Gamper.

== Barcelona ==
=== Foundation of the club ===

In 1899, Gamper went to Barcelona to visit his uncle who was living there. He was on his way to Africa to help set up some sugar trading companies but fell in love with the Catalan city and decided to stay put. He would later become a fluent Catalan speaker and adopt the Catalan version of his name: &quot;Joan Gamper&quot;. As an accountant, he found work with Crédit Lyonnais, the Sarrià Railway Company and as a sports columnist, he worked for two Swiss newspapers. Gamper joined the local Swiss Evangelical Church and began playing football within the local Christian Protestant community in the district of Sarrià-Sant Gervasi. During his free time, he also played football with a group of friends at the Velódromo de la Bonanova.

When Gamper, who had already founded clubs in his home country, decided to do the same in his new city, he contacted Jaime Vila, the director of the Tolosa gym, which at the time was the home of a group of football enthusiasts that was also practising the sport in Bonanova. He proposed to him the idea of creating a well-organized football club, but Vila rejected him as he did not want foreigners in its ranks and ended up founding Català in October 1899. This did not discourage him, however, with Gamper now aiming to create an organization that was open to everyone, regardless of their origin. He envisaged a club that served as a means of social integration, in which everyone could speak their mind, and create a democratic society that was freely governed by its members.

Immediately afterwards, he and his friend Walter Wild arrived at the Gimnasio Solé. There they were well received by Narciso Masferrer, who had the headquarters of his numerous associations and of the &quot;Los Deportes&quot; newsroom in the said gym, and they did not take long to publish Gamper&#x27;s infamous advert declaring his wish to form a football club, published on 22 October 1899. A positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November and &quot;Futbol Club Barcelona&quot; was born. The founders included a collection of Swiss, British, and Spanish enthusiasts. It is not known if Gamper chose the legendary club colours, , after Basel or Excelsior Zürich, although the official version states that brothers Arthur and Ernest Witty (both very involved with the club in its first years) proposed the &quot;blaugrana&quot; colors, the same used by the rugby team of Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in Great Crosby (which they had attended).

=== Playing career ===

Although Gamper was the driving force behind the club, initially he chose to only be a board member and club captain. He was still only 22 and wanted to concentrate on playing, featuring in the club&#x27;s first-ever game held at Bonanova on 8 December 1899 against a team known as &quot;Team Anglès&quot;, which consisted of members of the British colony living in Barcelona, where he captained his side in a 0–1 loss. In the club&#x27;s second game, he was the author of Barça&#x27;s first ever goal, netting twice in a 3–1 win over Català. Gamper played 55 games for Barcelona between 1899 and 1903, scoring 126 goals, thus achieving a game ratio of 2.35 goals per game. Gamper scored most of his goals in official competitions, with 31 of them coming in the 1900–01 Copa Macaya alone, netting two nine-goal hauls against Franco-Española and Club Tarragona, and a further eight-goal haul in the return game with Franco, but despite his goalscoring prowess, Barça ended as runner-ups to Hispania. In the following season, however, he helped Barcelona win the club&#x27;s first trophy, the Copa Macaya in 1901–02, netting a hat-trick on the final matchday on 23 March 1902 in a 15–0 victory over Català. He was the tournament&#x27;s top goal scorer again with 19 goals, just two more than teammate Udo Steinberg. The Copa Macaya is now recognized as the first Catalan championship.

In 1902, Gamper was a member of the Barcelona team that participated in the Copa de la Coronación (predecessor of Copa del Rey), and in the semi-finals on 13 May, Barça faced Real Madrid (then Madrid FC) for the first time, and Gamper netted a goal to help his side to a 3–1 win in the first-ever El Clásico. In the final, however, Barça lost 2–1 to Club Vizcaya. In 1903, he added a new title to his career, the Copa Barcelona, which was later recognized as the fourth edition of the Catalan Championship. On 1 February 1903, Gamper scored nine goals to help Barça to a 13–0 win over X Sporting Club in the Copa Barcelona, thus becoming the first and only player to score three nine-goal hauls in his career at Barça. In fact, he is the only one to have done it in a competitive match, since Josep Escolà, who also scored nine goals for Barça in an 11–1 trashing of Real Unión in 1935, but that was a friendly match.

=== Club presidency ===
In 1908, Gamper became president of Barcelona for the first time. Gamper took over the presidency as the club was on the verge of folding. Several of the club&#x27;s better players had retired and had not been replaced. This soon began to affect the club&#x27;s performances both on and off the field. The club had not won anything since the &quot;Campionat de Catalunya&quot; of 1905 and its finances suffered as a result. He was subsequently club president on five separate occasions (&quot;1908–09, 1910–13, 1917–19, 1921–23&quot; and &quot;1924–25&quot;) and spent 25 years at the helm. One of his main achievements was to help Barça acquire their own stadium. Until 1909 the team played at various grounds, none of them owned by the club. Gamper raised funds from local businesses and on 14 March 1909, they moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with an initial capacity of 1,500 spectators, but in 1916 it increased to 6,000, and it was considered the best in the city. He also launched a campaign to recruit more club members and by 1922 the club had over 10,000. This led to the club moving again, this time to &quot;Les Corts&quot;. This stadium had an initial capacity of 20,000, later expanded to an impressive 48,000 in 1946.

Gamper also recruited the legendary player Paulino Alcántara, the club&#x27;s seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917 appointed Jack Greenwell as manager. This saw the club&#x27;s fortunes begin to improve on the field. During the Gamper era, Barcelona won eleven &quot;Championat de Catalunya&quot;, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cup and enjoyed its first &quot;golden age&quot;. As well as Alcántara the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga and Franz Platko.

Gamper&#x27;s final presidency ended in controversial circumstances and personal tragedy. On 14 June 1925, Barcelona fans jeered the Spanish national anthem and then applauded &quot;God Save the King,&quot; performed by a visiting British Royal Marine band. The dictatorship of Primo de Rivera accused Gamper of promoting Catalan nationalism. And in fact, as a sign of his gratitude to Catalonia, the country that had welcomed him, Gamper imbued Barcelona with the essence that has come to define it ever since: its commitment to Catalan identity. Gamper was forced into exile after the events of Les Corts of 1925.

The club which he saved various times from disappearing, paid a tribute to him, along with all of Catalan football on 25 February 1923, and another posthumous tribute was made on 24 June 1934, both at the Les Corts ground.

== Death ==

On 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression, probably as a result of his business problems.

His funeral was attended by many people in the city. Players of Barcelona took the coffin to the Cemetery of Montjuïc, where Gamper was buried.

== Legacy ==
In 1966, the Barcelona president Enric Llaudet created the Joan Gamper Trophy in his honour. This is a pre-season tournament featuring international teams as guests and is traditionally used by the club to unveil the team for the forthcoming season. The club also permanently retired his club membership number and the city named a street, &quot;Carrer de Joan Gamper&quot; in Les Corts district, after him. In 2016, also in Zurich, a small street in a central location of the city already named &quot;Gamperstrasse&quot; has been dedicated to him.

In 2002, Barcelona marked the 100th anniversary of his birth. In 2004, the Winterthur Group, a Swiss insurance company with offices in Barcelona since 1910, became sponsors of the Barcelona basketball team, which led to the team featuring the birthplace of Gamper on their shirts and in their name Winterthur FCB until 2007, after Winterthur Group was purchased by AXA. Perhaps this and the fact that the club developed into a polideportivo, the very personification of Gamper, is the most fitting tribute to this all-round sportsman. Today, Barcelona is &quot;more than just a football club&quot;. It promotes amateur track and field sports and has rugby union and cycling teams. All of these were sports played by Gamper. Barça also has professional basketball, handball and roller hockey teams as well as amateur indoor football, women&#x27;s football, volleyball, baseball and field hockey teams. Over the years, they have even had an ice hockey team.

<doc id="1213622" wikidata="Q3195674" url="?curid=1213622" title="Southern Bavarian">
<text>Southern Bavarian or South Bavarian, is a cluster of Upper German dialects of the Bavarian group. They are primarily spoken in Tyrol (i.e. the Austrian federal state of Tyrol and the Italian province of South Tyrol), in Carinthia and in the western parts of Upper Styria. Before 1945 and the expulsions of the Germans, it was also spoken in speech islands in Italy and Yugoslavia.
Due to these Alpine regions, many features of the Old Bavarian language from the Middle High German period have been preserved. On the other hand, the Southern Bavarian dialect area is influenced by the Rhaeto-Romance languages, locally also Slovene and to a lesser extent Italian.

The speech area historically included the former linguistic enclaves in Carniola (present-day Slovenia) around Kočevje in the &quot;Gottschee&quot; region (Gottscheerish), Sorica &quot;(Zarz)&quot; and Nemški Rovt &quot;(Deutsch Ruth)&quot;. The Cimbrian language still spoken in several language-islands in north-eastern Italy (Friuli, Veneto and Trentino) mostly counts as a separate Bavarian language variant. Southern Bavarian is also spoken in the Werdenfelser Land region around Mittenwald and Garmisch-Partenkirchen in German Upper Bavaria.

The Tyrolean Unterland, the Alpine regions of Salzburg (Pinzgau, Pongau and Lungau), as well as the adjacent parts of Styria and southern Burgenland form the dialect continuum with the Central Bavarian language area in the north.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Southern Bavarian has 8 vowels:

<doc id="1213640" wikidata="Q7589690" url="?curid=1213640" title="St. Louis School, Hong Kong">
<text>St. Louis School (), located in Sai Ying Pun (historically West Point, Hong Kong) is a privately run, Catholic primary and (government-subsidized) secondary English grammar school. There are currently about 800 secondary students and 350 primary school students.
==History==
===Early history===
During the 1840s, the present location of St. Louis School was the site of a small battery, called the West Point Battery or Elliot&#x27;s Battery.

St. Louis School was founded in 1864 by the Fathers of the Catholic Mission; St Aloysius was chosen as the patron of the school. The school was initially known as the West Point Reformatory. The Brothers of the Christian Schools (commonly known as the La Salle Brothers) succeeded the Fathers in the management of the school in 1875 and managed the school until 1893.

In 1921, Bishop Pozzoni, the ordinary of Hong Kong, requested the Maryknoll Fathers to take over. Some of the boys were orphans while the rest were remanded by the Hong Kong government, the government giving a small monthly grant for each student. The Maryknoll Fathers renamed the school &#x27;St Louis Industrial School&#x27; and equipped it with a printing press. The students became expert in this line, and seven years later when the Paris Foreign Missions Society started their celebrated polyglot press at Nazareth in Pokfulam, they took into their employ many of these boys. 

When Brother Albert Staubli arrived, he added manual training to its curriculum in the way of carpentry. The American Maryknoller Fr James Edward Walsh, who was one of the first four American missioners to arrive in China and the last Western missioner to be released by the Communist China in 1970, spent some time at the school too.

Early in 1926, Maryknoll&#x27;s father superior and one of the co-founders, Fr James Anthony Walsh, made a visitation of his fledgling mission fields in South China and spent some weeks in Hong Kong before visiting Kongmoon (now called Jiangmen) and Kaying (in Meixian). In the course of his stay, the position of the industrial school was reviewed and it was eventually handed back to the diocese.

===Salesian Fathers===
In 1927, the school was given to the Salesian Fathers and has been run by them since then. The year 1927 is now regarded as the founding year of today&#x27;s school. The school was transformed from a vocational school to an English grammar school in 1948.

The primary section of St Louis School was particularly famous in the 1970s and the 1980s, for it won almost all the inter-school quiz competitions organized by Radio Television Hong Kong.

==Facilities==
The school consists of four wings: East, North, Central and West. The oldest one is the East Wing (Block A), which was built in 1936. The North Wing was damaged by a typhoon in 1942, and a new building was subsequently erected. The Central and West Wings were constructed and opened in 1941 and 1967, respectively.

The school&#x27;s sports facilities include a football playground (with a stand for about 1,100 people), a basketball court and a covered playground. The football playground is the largest among those of all the schools in West Point.

==School badge, motto, song==
The badge of St Louis School embodies a profound philosophy through the simplicity of its design.

*The white background symbolizes the innocence of the students.
*The central red cross reminds the students to adopt Christ as their mentor, and to possess love and passion, a sense of self-sacrifice and full service.
*The letters &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;L&#x27; are the initials of Saint Louis.
*The two Greek letters Α (Alpha) and Ω (Omega) in the book on the cross exhort the students to pursue virginity.
*The Latin phrase &#x27; SCIENTIA ET PIETAS&#x27; at the bottom of the badge is the school motto, it means &#x27;knowledge and piety&#x27;. It instructs the students to place equal emphases on both knowledge and piety.

The school song &#x27;All Hail, All Hail&#x27; was written by Rev Fr Janssen in 1957.

<text>William Rogers Taylor (7 November 1811 – 14 April 1889) was a rear admiral of the United States Navy who served during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Taylor was born in Newport, Rhode Island. He was appointed as a U.S. Navy midshipman in 1828, served in the sloops of war and during the next decade, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1840. He next had United States Coast Survey duty, then was an officer of the sloop of war during the Mexican War, when he also served in the Naval Battery during the siege of Vera Cruz. In 1848–49 he was assigned to the Naval Asylum in Philadelphia, then to the sloop of war . For eight years, beginning in 1853, he primarily served in the field of naval ordnance. In 1855, he received promotion to commander.

Promoted to the rank of captain in July 1862, he commanded the steam sloop during the next several months. In 1863, he was Fleet Captain of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In that role, he participated in attacks on Confederate fortifications protecting Charleston, South Carolina. Captain Taylor commanded the steam sloop during 1864–65 and took part in the operations that led to the capture of Fort Fisher, North Carolina.

In 1866, a year after the end of the Civil War, Taylor was advanced to the rank of commodore. For the next five years, he had further ordnance duty and commanded the Northern Pacific Squadron Division of the Pacific Squadron. He reached the rank of rear admiral in early 1871 and spent his final active duty period as President of the Board of Examiners. Rear Admiral William Rogers Taylor was placed on the Retired List in November 1873.

Taylor died at Washington, D.C., on 14 April 1889.

==Namesake==
The destroyer (1942–1969) was named for him.

<text>The TRS-80 Model 100 is a notebook-sized portable computer introduced in April 1983. It was the first commercially successful notebook computer, as well as one of the first notebook computers ever released. It features a keyboard and liquid-crystal display, in a battery-powered package roughly the size and shape of a notepad or large book. The 224-page, spiral-bound User Manual is nearly the same size as the computer itself.

It was made by Kyocera, and originally sold in Japan as the Kyotronic 85. Although a slow seller for Kyocera, the rights to the machine were purchased by Tandy Corporation. The computer was sold through Radio Shack stores in the United States and Canada and affiliated dealers in other countries. It became one of the company&#x27;s most popular models, with over 6 million units sold worldwide. The Olivetti M-10 and the NEC PC-8201 and PC-8300 were also built on the same Kyocera platform, with some design and hardware differences. It was originally marketed as a &quot;Micro Executive Work Station&quot; (MEWS), although the term did not catch on and was eventually dropped.

== Specifications ==

* Processor: 8-bit Oki 80C85, CMOS, 
* Memory: 32 KB ROM; 8, 16, 24, or 32 KB static RAM. Machines with less than 32 KB can be expanded in 8 KB increments of plug-in static RAM modules. An additional 32 KB Option ROM can be installed, for a total of 64 KB of ROM (bank-switched in a 32 KB aperture), and the Standard ROM is socket-mounted (not soldered-in) so is readily replaceable.
* Display: 8 lines, 40 characters LCD, twisted nematic (gray) monochrome, with 240 by 64 pixel addressable graphics. The screen is reflective, not backlit. The screen was made by Sharp Electronics. The LCD controllers are by Hitachi: (10) HD44102CH column controller ICs and (2) HD44103CH row driver ICs; the HD44102CH&#x27;s provide the programmable hardware interface to software. The refresh rate is about (coarsely regulated by an RC oscillator, not a crystal).
* Keyboard: 56 keys, QWERTY layout with full standard spacing, 8 programmable function keys, 4 dedicated command keys, and 4 cursor control keys. These last 16 are tactile &quot;button&quot;-style keys. Almost all keys other than the 16 &quot;button&quot; keys are capable of key rollover (without phantom keys appearing depressed), so multi-key combinations can be used.
* Peripherals: The basic unit includes: Built-in 300 baud telephone (POTS) modem (North American versions), Centronics-compatible parallel printer port, RS-232 serial communication port (sharing serial I/O chip with internal modem), barcode reader input, cassette audio tape I/O, real-time clock.
* Expansion: System bus interface DIP socket (under a cover on the bottom of the machine).
* Dimensions: , weight about with batteries
* Power supply: Four penlight (AA) cells, or external power adapter 6V (&gt;180 mA, tip negative configuration)

The 8K and 24K versions sold for and respectively.

The Model 100 was promoted as being able to run up to 20 hours and maintain memory up to 30 days on a set of four alkaline AA batteries. It could not run from the rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries available at the time, but a hardware modification was available that made this possible.

== Data storage ==
The computer&#x27;s available form of mass storage is the port for a cassette audiotape recorder, which is reportedly finicky and unreliable. Several attempts to read a tape may be required, along with adjustment of the volume setting.

A popular alternative is the &quot;Tandy Portable Disk Drive&quot; (TPDD), introduced in late 1985, an RS-232 serial device capable of storing 100 KB of data FM-encoded on a 3.5-inch single-sided double-density diskette; this drive is identical to the Brother FB100 drive for knitting machines. A second version, the &quot;TPDD2&quot;, can store up to 200 KB.

A Disk/Video Interface expansion box was released in 1984, with one single-sided double-density 180 KB 5-1/4 inch disk drive and a CRT video adapter. This allows the Model 100 to display 40 or 80 column video on an external television set or video monitor. One empty drive bay permits the installation of a second disk drive.

Another popular form of data backup was that of file transfer to a desktop computer, via either the modem connected to a telephone line, or the RS-232 serial port connected to a null modem cable. The built-in TELCOM firmware makes this a convenient option. The TRS-80 Model 4&#x27;s TRSDOS 6 operating system includes a utility called TAPE100 that uses the Model 4&#x27;s cassette port to read and write tapes created by a Model 100, the data of which are stored in TRSDOS disk files. Also because TRSDOS 6 included a communications application (COMM/CMD), the Model 100 proved a popular &quot;peripheral&quot; for the Model 4 customer.

A bar code reader wand was also offered.

== ROM firmware ==
When first switched on, the Model 100 displays a menu of applications and files and the date and time. The ROM firmware-based system boots instantly, and the program that was running when the unit was powered off is ready to use immediately on power-up. Cursor keys are used to navigate the menu and select one of the internal or added application programs, or any data file to be worked upon.

The 32 kilobyte read-only memory of the Model 100 contains the N82 version of the Microsoft BASIC 80 programming language. This is similar to other Microsoft BASICs of the time and includes good support for the hardware features of the machine: pixel addressing of the display, support for the internal modem and serial port, monophonic sound, access to tape and RAM files, support for the real-time clock and the bar code reader, and I/O redirection between the machine&#x27;s various logical devices. Like previous Microsoft BASIC interpreters, variable names were restricted to two characters and all program lines and subroutines were numbered and not named. However, the default for floating point numbers is double-precision.

The ROM also contains a terminal program, TELCOM; an address/phone book organizer, ADDRSS; a to-do list organizer, SCHEDL; and a simple text editor, TEXT. The TELCOM program allows automation of a login sequence to a remote system under control of the BASIC interpreter. As with other home computers of the era, a vast collection of PEEK and POKE locations were collected by avid hobbyists.

The Model 100 TEXT editor was noticeably slow in execution, especially for fast touch typists. This was due partly to the slow 8085 CPU and due partly to the slow response time of the LCD screen. Often after speed-typing a sentence or two, the user would have to wait several seconds for the computer to &quot;catch up&quot;. 

A perhaps not well-known but documented feature of TEXT was that it partially supported the WordStar command interface. The supported commands were the cursor movement and character deletion &lt;Control&gt;&lt;alpha&gt; key combinations on the left hand side of the keyboard; the commands for activating Wordstar menus, like the &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;K&gt; Block menu, were not functional.

Invisible files in the system RAM named &quot;Hayashi&quot; and &quot;Suzuki&quot; commemorate the names of designers Junji Hayashi and Jay Suzuki. Another invisible deleted file named &quot;RickY&quot; refers to Rick Yamashita. The Model 100 firmware was the last Microsoft product that Bill Gates developed personally, along with Suzuki. According to Gates, &quot;part of my nostalgia about this machine is this was the last machine where I wrote a very high percentage of the code in the product&quot;.

Added applications and data files are stored in the internal battery-backed RAM; these can be loaded from and stored to an audio cassette tape recorder or external floppy disk drive. Optional ROMs can be installed in the Model 100, providing a range of customized application software. Only one optional ROM can be installed at a time. Some commercial software applications for the Model 100 were also distributed on cassette.

The Model 100 ROM has a Y2K bug; the century displayed on the main menu was hard-coded as &quot;19XX&quot;. Workarounds exist for this problem. Since the century of the date is not important for any of the software functions, and the real-time clock hardware in the Model 100 does not have a calendar and requires the day of the week to be set independently of the date, the flaw does not at all impair the usability of the computer; it is cosmetic.

== Applications ==

When introduced, the portability and simplicity of the Model 100 made it attractive to journalists, who could type about 11 pages of text (if upgraded to the maximum of 32 KB RAM) and then transmit it for electronic editing and production using the built-in modem and TELCOM program.

The keyboard is full-size and uses a standard (QWERTY) layout; reviewers praised it but reported that it was noisy. To quiet the computer, owners put orthodontic rubber bands under the keys. The computer is otherwise silent when it operates, except for the speaker, and runs for 20 hours on 4 readily available and easily replaceable AA batteries. Data is protected by a built-in rechargeable (Ni-Cd) battery when the AA batteries discharge or are removed for replacement. There are several simple programs available on the Internet for transferring files between a Model 100 and a modern personal computer (or a vintage one).

The Model 100 was also used for industrial applications and in science laboratories as a programming terminal for configuration of control systems and instruments. Its compactness (ease of handling and small space requirements), low maintenance needs, lack of air vents (a plus for dusty or dirty environments), full complement of ports, and easy portability made it very well suited for these applications.

Third-party peripherals for the Model 100 extended its battery life and file storage capacity. Software was designed, and is still available, to extend the display capabilities (to 60 columns and 10 rows of text using smaller characters) and to provide more advanced word-processing or calculation software than the supplied programs. To this day, hobbyists continue to design games, applications, and hardware for this device. Simple drawing programs and games using the pixel-addressable display were favorites among users. As with virtually all other contemporary home computers, users are able to create their own applications using the included BASIC programming language. There are no built-in facilities for 8085 assembler programming, but the thoroughly-documented BASIC interpreter by Microsoft offered the clever coder tricks for accessing machine code subroutines. These tricks usually involved packing the raw object code into strings or integer arrays, and would be familiar to veteran programmers for the older TRS-80 Models I and III.

== Peers and successors ==


The Tandy 200 was introduced in 1984 as a more capable sister product of the Model 100. The Tandy 200 has a flip-up 16 line by 40 column display and came with 24 KB RAM which can be expanded to 72 KB (3 banks of 24 KB). Rather than the &quot;button&quot; style keys of the Model 100, its four arrow keys are a cluster of keys of the same size and shape as those comprising the keyboard, though the function and command &quot;keys&quot; are still of the button type. The Tandy 200 includes Multiplan, a spreadsheet application. It also added DTMF tone dialing for the internal modem, whereas the Model 100 only supports pulse dialing. On a phone line that doesn&#x27;t support pulse dialing, users may dial manually using a touch-tone phone and then put the Model 100 online.
The last new model that could be considered part of this line was the Tandy 600, introduced in October 1985. Similar to the Tandy 200, it features a flip-up screen, but with 80 columns rather than 40. Built-in features include a 3.5&quot; diskette drive, rechargeable batteries, and 32K of RAM expandable to 224K. The underlying software platform was Microsoft&#x27;s 16-bit Hand Held Operating System (Handheld DOS or HHDOS), along with word processing, calendar, database, communication and spreadsheet software. Unlike earlier models, BASIC was an extra-cost option rather than built in.
The last refresh to the product line was the Tandy 102, introduced in 1986 as a direct replacement for the Model 100, having the same software, keyboard, and screen, and a nearly identical, but thinner, form factor that weighed about one pound less than the Model 100. This reduction in size and weight was made possible by the substitution of surface-mount chip packaging. Standard memory for the Model 102, 24K RAM, was upgradable to 32K with an ordinary 8K SRAM chip.
Later portables from Tandy no longer featured a ROM-based software environment, starting with the Tandy 1400LT, which ran a diskette-based MS-DOS operating system in 768 KB of RAM, utilising two built-in 3.5&quot; floppy drives. This model resembled the IBM PC Convertible with a &quot;clamshell&quot; design and had a screen supporting a textual display of characters and a graphical resolution of pixels, with eight intensity levels achieved using a form of pulse-width modulation.
Tandy also released similar word processing portables for the education market based on a Z80-compatible CPU: the Tandy WP-2 in 1989 equipped with 32 KB of RAM and 256 KB of ROM containing the application software, and the Tandy WP-3 in 1993 equipped with 64 KB of RAM. The WP-2 provided serial and parallel interfaces, a cassette recorder port, an expansion card slot for 32 KB of non-volatile RAM, and an internal 32 KB RAM expansion slot. A disk drive was also available, connected via the serial port. In 1993, Tandy also announced the Tandy PPC-10 pocket PC, based on an 80C86-compatible CPU and having 1 MB of RAM, bundled with MS-DOS 5.0, Microsoft Works 2.0, PC link and personal information management software, also featuring two PCMCIA slots.

=== Similar computers from other companies ===


The Olivetti M10, NEC PC-8201 and NEC PC-8300 were built on the same platform as the original Kyocera design, although the Olivetti M10 had a display that could be tilted towards the user. The earlier and smaller Epson HX-20 of 1982 used a much smaller LCD display, four lines of twenty characters, and had an internal cassette tape drive for program and file storage. There were several other &quot;calculator-style&quot; computers available at the time, including the Casio FP-200, the Compact Computer 40, and the Canon X-07.
Systems of about the same size and form-factor as the Model 100, aimed at journalists, were sold by companies such as Teleram, as the Teleram T-3000 and GRiD Systems, as the GRiD Compass, which was used by NASA. GRiD was later acquired by Tandy. The Bondwell 2 of 1985 was a CP/M laptop in a similar form factor to the Model 200. Both Convergent Technologies and MicroOffice released the WorkSlate and the RoadRunner respectively in late 1983, which similarly targeted mobile computing.
Computers from two other British companies were similar in form and functionality to the Model 100 and its successors. The Cambridge Z88 of 1987, developed by British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, had greater expansion capacity due to its built-in cartridge slots. It had a far more sophisticated operating system called OZ that could run multiple applications in a task-switched environment. The firmware contained a powerful application called Pipedream that was a spreadsheet that could also serve capably as a word processor and database. In comparison, the Tandy WP-2 was regarded in one review as &quot;easier to use and sturdier than the Z88&quot; with a &quot;proper keyboard&quot; as opposed to the Z88&#x27;s &quot;rubber membrane keyboard&quot;. Moreover, the WP-2 also included a 100,000-word spellchecking dictionary and 200,000-word thesaurus, making the Tandy product more compelling as a dedicated word processor. The other British computers were the Amstrad NC100 and NC200, produced from 1992.

The electronic word processing keyboards AlphaSmart Dana and the Quickpad Pro bear some resemblance to the physical format of the TRS-80 Model 100. In Japan, Pomera still makes and sells dedicated word processors under model names Pomera DM100, Pomera DM200 etc.

The Laser 50 educational computer is in the same size and form factor as the Model 100, and was sold by Video Technology.

== Reception ==
Tandy stated that the Model 100&#x27;s sales &quot;have only been moderate&quot;, and an &quot;InfoWorld&quot; columnist later claimed that &quot;it was only journalists&quot; who had been buying it. The system&#x27;s popularity with journalists, however, probably helped Radio Shack improve the company&#x27;s poor reputation with the press and in the industry. The magazine&#x27;s reviewer called the computer &quot;remarkable&quot;, praising its power relative to size and price and noting that he wrote the review &quot;at the lofty height of 37,500 feet aboard a United DC-10&quot;. He concluded, &quot;I&#x27;m not used to giving Radio Shack kudos, but the Model 100 is a brave, imaginative, useful addition to the realm of microcomputerdom&quot; and &quot;a leading contender for &quot;InfoWorld&quot;″s Hardware Product of the Year for 1983&quot;, an award which it indeed won.

&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1983 described the Model 100 as &quot;an amazing machine&quot;. While noting the lack of mass storage, the reviewer praised &quot;one of the nicest keyboards I&#x27;ve used on any machine, large or small&quot; and the &quot;equally impressive&quot; built-in software, and concluded &quot;the designers of this machine ... should be congratulated&quot;. Dave Winer in 1984 described the 100 in the magazine as &quot;the first useful portable computer&quot;, listing its screen, keyboard, and software as why it was &quot;a breakthrough&quot;. The magazine later stated that &quot;Tandy practically invented the laptop computer&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; criticized the Model 100 display&#x27;s viewing angle, but noted that the text editor automatically reflowed paragraphs unlike WordStar. It concluded that the computer &quot;is an ingenious, capable device ... an exciting example of the new wave of portable computers&quot;.

&quot;Your Computer&quot; magazine selected the Kyocera portable computer (including the Tandy, NEC and Olivetti models) as the best personal computer in its 1983 &quot;Personal Computer of the Year&quot; awards. &quot;Creative Computing&quot; said that the Model 100 was &quot;the clear winner&quot; in the category of notebook portables under $1000 for 1984, although cautioning that &quot;the 8K version is practically useless&quot;.

<doc id="1213664" wikidata="Q641677" url="?curid=1213664" title="La Bamba (song)">
<text>&quot;La Bamba&quot; () is a Mexican folk song, originally from the state of Veracruz, also known as &quot;La Bomba&quot;. The song is best known from a 1958 adaptation by Ritchie Valens, a Top 40 hit on the U.S. charts. Valens&#x27;s version is ranked number 345 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine′s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and is the only song on the list not written or sung in English.

&quot;La Bamba&quot; has been covered by numerous artists, notably by Los Lobos whose version was the title track of the 1987 film &quot;La Bamba&quot;, a bio-pic about Valens; their version reached No. 1 on many charts in the same year.

==Traditional versions==
&quot;La Bamba&quot; is a classic example of the &quot;son jarocho&quot; musical style, which originated in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and combines Spanish, indigenous, Afro-Mexican and Afro-Caribbean musical elements. &quot;La Bamba&quot; likely originated in the last years of the 17th century in 1683 during a slave uprising known as the Bambarria. The song would be played at weddings with lyrics being encouraged to be made up, over 500-1000 known verses exist. The bride and the groom would tie a ribbon together on their toes and dance to La Bamba as a symbol of love, fistfights or knife fights would break out amongst guests as well. The word bamba is of African origin meaning wood referring to dancing on a wooden floor. Initially, the song satirized the late and futile efforts made by the viceroy of Mexico to defend the citizens of the port of Veracruz from pirates. Likewise, its name also alludes to a dance of Spanish origin called bamba, which was popular at that time. The oldest known historical references come from the town of Alvarado, Mexico, where it apparently was performed with an atypically lively rhythm.

&quot;La Bamba&quot; is typically played on one or two arpa jarochas (harps) along with guitar relatives the jarana jarocha and the requinto jarocho. Lyrics to the song vary greatly, as performers often improvise verses while performing. However, versions such as those by musical groups Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan and Los Pregoneros del Puerto have survived because of the artists&#x27; popularity. The traditional aspect of &quot;La Bamba&quot; lies in the tune, which remains almost the same through most versions. The name of the dance referenced within the song, which has no direct English translation, is presumably connected with the Spanish verb &quot;bambolear&quot;, meaning &quot;to sway&quot;, &quot;to shake&quot; or &quot;to wobble&quot;. In one traditional version of this dance performed at weddings and &quot;ballet folklórico&quot; shows, couples use intricate footwork to create a bow signifying their union.

==Early recordings==
&quot;La Bamba&quot; has its origin in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The oldest recorded version known is that of Alvaro Hernández Ortiz, who recorded the song with the name of &quot;El Jarocho&quot;. His recording was released by Victor Records in Mexico in 1938 or 1939, and was reissued on a 1997 compilation by Yazoo Records, &quot;The Secret Museum of Mankind Vol. 4&quot;.

According to a 1945 article in &quot;Life&quot;, the song and associated dance were brought &quot;out of the jungle&quot; at Veracruz by American bandleader Everett Hoagland, who introduced it at Ciro&#x27;s nightclub in Mexico City. It became popular, and the song was adopted by Mexican presidential candidate Miguel Alemán Valdés who used it in his successful campaign. Later in 1945, the music and dance were introduced at the Stork Club in New York City by Arthur Murray. A popular version by Andrés Huesca (1917–1957) and his brother Victor, billed as Hermanos Huesca, was issued on Peerless Records in Mexico around 1945–46. Huesca re-recorded the song for RCA Victor in 1947, and the same year the song featured as a production number in the MGM musical film &quot;Fiesta&quot;, performed by a group called Los Bocheros. The song was featured in the 1946 Mexican movie &quot;Rayando el Sol&quot; starring Pedro Armendáriz.

The Swedish-American folk singer William Clauson recorded the song in several languages in the early and mid-1950s. He claimed to have heard the song in Veracruz, and in performance slowed down the tempo to encourage audience participation. Another version, &quot;somewhat bowdlerized&quot;, was recorded by Cynthia Gooding on her 1953 Elektra album, &quot;Mexican Folk Songs&quot;.

==Ritchie Valens version==

Ritchie Valens learned the song in his youth, from his cousin Dickie Cota. In 1958 he recorded a rock and roll flavored version of &quot;La Bamba&quot;, together with session musicians Buddy Clark (string bass); Ernie Freeman (piano); Carol Kaye (acoustic rhythm guitar); René Hall (Danelectro six-string baritone guitar); and Earl Palmer (drums and claves). It was originally released as the B-side of &quot;Donna&quot;, on the Del-Fi label.

The song features a simple verse-chorus form. Valens, who was proud of his Mexican heritage, was hesitant at first to merge &quot;La Bamba&quot; with rock and roll, but subsequently agreed to do so. The song ranked No. 98 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of Rock and Roll&quot; in 1999, and No. 59 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot; in 2000. Furthermore, Valens&#x27; recording of the song was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The song was listed at number 354 in the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, being the only non-English language song included in the list. It was also included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). Valens was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2018, Valens&#x27; version was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of 500 songs that were influential in shaping rock and roll.

==Los Lobos version==

The music video directed by Sherman Halsey won the 1988 MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film; it also featured Lou Diamond Phillips, the actor who played Valens in the 1987 film &quot;La Bamba&quot;. The song was also the fourth wholly non-English language song to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

<text>Bracketology is the process of predicting the field of college basketball participants in the NCAA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments, named as such because it is commonly used to fill in tournament brackets for the postseason. It incorporates some method of predicting the metrics the NCAA Selection Committee will use (such as rating percentage index through the 2018 tournament, and the NCAA Evaluation Tool [NET] since 2019) in order to determine at-large (non-conference winning) teams to complete the field of 68 teams, and, to seed the field by ranking all teams from first through sixty-eighth. Bracketology also encompasses the process of predicting the winners of each of the brackets. In recent years the concept of bracketology has been applied to areas other than basketball.

==Background==
Joe Lunardi is credited with inventing the term &quot;bracketology&quot;. Lunardi had been editor and owner of the &quot;Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook&quot;, a preseason guide roughly 400 pages long. In 1995, &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; added an 80-page postseason supplement which was released the night the brackets were announced. So that the release could be timely, Lunardi began predicting the selection committee&#x27;s bracket. On February 25, 1996, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; referred to Lunardi as a &quot;bracketologist&quot;, which is the first known instance the term was applied to a college basketball expert. While Lunardi did not recall using the term before its use in the article, &quot;Inquirer&quot; writer Mike Jensen credits its origins to Lunardi. Lunardi soon started the website Bracketology.net, and ESPN began running his predictions in exchange for a link to his website. 

By 2002, Lunardi had his own Bracketology page with ESPN. He also teaches an online course at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University titled &quot;Fundamentals of Bracketology&quot;.

==Predicting participants==
Using the NCAA basketball tournament selection process, the NET, and the seeding and balancing process, a &quot;bracketologist&quot; places teams in the tournament in the various regions (most commonly East, West, Midwest, and South however sometimes the region names are changed to reflect the host cities). Some bracketologists go as far as placing teams in which &quot;pods&quot; they will play in the first and second rounds. Generally, the lists also show the last four teams in and the first four teams out. However, these brackets change daily as conference tournaments continue and teams automatically qualify for the tournament.

A bracketologist&#x27;s credibility is judged on how many teams they predict correctly being in the tournament and the average difference between the bracketologist&#x27;s projected seed and the actual seed assigned by the NCAA Selection Committee. The difference between projected matchups and the differences between the &quot;pods&quot; selected in the first and second rounds are less important. Typically, bracketologists measure their success by comparing their projected seed lists to other bracketologists, as can be seen on the bracket matrix.

==Predicting winners==

Various methods are used to predict the winners in a bracket. While some use math and statistics, others make selections based on team mascots or colors. President Barack Obama famously made bracket predictions. After entering office, he presented his projected winners annually on ESPN in a segment called Barack-etology. However, in 2015 he was bested by his former political rival and 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, who ranked in the top 0.1 percent of entrants in ESPN&#x27;s 2015 Tournament Challenge. Romney correctly predicted six of the &quot;Elite Eight&quot; teams, all of the &quot;Final Four&quot; teams, both teams in the championship game matchup, and that Duke would win the title.

==Non-basketball applications==
Bracketology as a discipline has spread beyond a focus on basketball, into other sports, as well as pop culture, history, nature, and other topics where a loose application of binary opposition may be profitable for study or enjoyment, albeit without the label of &quot;bracketology&quot; itself.

This spread has been helped along by literary agent and writer Mark Reiter and sports journalist Richard Sandomir, who have edited two books on bracketology as applied to the world around them, most recently &quot;The Final Four of Everything&quot;, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in May 2009.

<doc id="1213667" wikidata="Q2470344" url="?curid=1213667" title="Break the Cycle">
<text>Break the Cycle is the third studio album by American rock band Staind, released through Flip Records and Elektra Entertainment on May 8, 2001. It is Staind&#x27;s most successful album to date and was the album that broke them into the mainstream. It was a huge international success for the band, as it spent three weeks at number-one position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top-10 album charts of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the UK and New Zealand. It sold at least 4 million copies in 2001. The album was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA for sales of over five million units in the U.S on September 8, 2003.

==Background==
A total of five singles were released from this album—&quot;It&#x27;s Been Awhile&quot;, &quot;Fade&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot;, &quot;For You&quot; and &quot;Epiphany&quot;—all of which did incredibly well. There were videos made for each of these songs (some of which can be found on Staind&#x27;s 2002 DVD &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;). The first four singles had varying degrees of success in the UK, &quot;It&#x27;s Been Awhile&quot; charting the highest of the four released in both countries. The album also includes a track called &quot;Waste&quot;, dedicated to a teenage fan who committed suicide. Like Staind&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Dysfunction&quot; (1999), &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; has alternative metal/nu metal sounds. However, the album also shows the band&#x27;s softer post-grunge sound, an element that the band wished to progress further with more acoustic and soft ballad tracks. This included an acoustic rendition of the entire album as a second disc, but this was not finalized.

There is also a bonus track on the album. In the United States, the bonus track is an acoustic version of &quot;It&#x27;s Been Awhile&quot;. However, on the Australian and European editions, the bonus track is a live acoustic version of &quot;Outside&quot;, performed with Fred Durst in Biloxi, Mississippi, on the Family Values Tour 1999.

==Sales==

Because of the record&#x27;s high recording budget of $800,000, there were many worries about whether the album would be successful, and the album almost had to top charts internationally just to break even with studio costs. &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of at least 717,600 copies. It remained at the top the following week, with 329,299 copies. In the third week it was number one again, with 244,698 copies. In the fourth week it dropped to number two, with 221,179 copies. It sold over 1 million copies in the first three weeks. The album sold 4,900,000 copies in the US and was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; also topped charts in the UK, where it was certified platinum; in New Zealand; and in Canada, where it had multiplatinum status. In 2001 the album was the tenth best-selling globally, selling 5.6 million copies.

==Reception==

Initial critical response ranged from mixed to average. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 55, based on nine reviews. Michael Gallucci of AllMusic gave &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; three out of five stars, saying, &quot;Cycle is ultimately no more than 50 minutes of standard-issue desolation&quot; and &quot;Staind wraps up all this pain in deceivingly melodic packages, sort of like Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;All Apologies&quot; without the depth.&quot;

<doc id="1213669" wikidata="Q5140747" url="?curid=1213669" title="Redskin">
<text>Redskin is a slang term for Native Americans in the United States and First Nations in Canada. The term &quot;redskin&quot; underwent pejoration through the 19th to early 20th centuries and in contemporary dictionaries of American English, it is labeled as offensive, disparaging, or insulting. Although the term has almost disappeared from contemporary use, it remains in use as a sports team name. The most prominent was the NFL&#x27;s Washington Redskins, who resisted decades of opposition before retiring the name in 2020 following renewed attention to racial justice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests. While the usage by other teams has been declining steadily, 37 high schools in the United States continue to use the &quot;Redskins&quot; name. School administrators and alumni assert that their use of the name is honoring their local tradition and not insulting to Native Americans.

The origin of the choice of red to describe Native Americans in English is debated. While related terms were used in anthropological literature as early as the 17th century, labels based on skin color entered everyday speech around the middle of the 18th century. &quot;At the start of the eighteenth century, Indians and Europeans rarely mentioned the color of each other&#x27;s skins. By midcentury, remarks about skin color and the categorization of peoples by simple color-coded labels (red, white, black) had become commonplace.&quot;

==Red as a racial identifier==
Documents from the colonial period indicate that the use of &quot;red&quot; as an identifier by Native Americans for themselves emerged in the context of Indian-European diplomacy in the southeastern region of North America, becoming common usage in the 1720s. Subsequently, variations of &quot;red men&quot; were adopted by Europeans, becoming a generic label for all Native Americans.

Linguistic evidence indicates that, while some tribes may have used &quot;red&quot; to refer to themselves during the pre-Columbian era based upon their origin stories, the general use of the term was in response to meeting people who called themselves &quot;white&quot; and their slaves &quot;black&quot;. The choice of red rather than other colors may have been due to cultural associations, rather than skin color. Red and white were a dichotomy that had pervasive symbolic meanings in southeastern Native cultures which was less prevalent among northern tribes. While there was occasional use of &quot;red&quot; in Indian-European diplomacy in the northeast, it was still rare there even after it had become common in the southeast. Instead, &quot;Indian&quot; was translated into the native languages there as &quot;men&quot;, &quot;real people&quot;, or &quot;original people&quot;. Usage in the northeast region by Europeans may have been largely limited to descriptions of tribes such as the Beothuk of Newfoundland, whose practice of painting their bodies and possessions with red ochre led Europeans to refer to them as &quot;Red Indians&quot;. The personification of the Americas was staged at Whitehall Palace in December 1613 by a dancer in &quot;The Somerset Masque&quot; wearing &quot;a skin coat the colour of the juice of mulberries, on her head large round brims of many coloured feathers, and in the midst of it a small crown&quot;.

Early ethnographic writers used a variety of terms; &quot;olivastre&quot; (olive) by François Bernier (1684), &quot;rufus&quot; (reddish, ruddy) by Linnaeus (1758), &quot;kupferroth&quot; (&quot;copper-red&quot;) by Blumenbach (1779), and eventually simply &quot;red&quot; by René Lesson (1847). Early explorers and later Anglo-Americans termed Native Americans &quot;light-skinned&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;tawny&quot;, or &quot;russet&quot;, but not &quot;red&quot; prior to the 19th century. Many did not view Natives as distinctly different in color from themselves, and thus could be assimilated into colonial society, beginning with conversion to Christianity.

In the modern debate over sports teams with the name, &quot;Oklahoma News 4&quot; asserted that Oklahoma should change its name. The name translates from Choctaw as &#x27;red people&#x27; ( &#x27;people&#x27; + &#x27;red&#x27;). However, has a number of possible meanings in Choctaw, one of which is &quot;humma, an addition to a man&#x27;s name which gives him some distinction, calling on him for courage and honor.&quot; The name &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was created in 1866 by Principal Chief Allen Wright (Choctaw, 1826–1885). The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma states that in the Choctaw language &quot;Okla&quot; means &quot;people&quot; and &quot;humma&quot; means &quot;red.&quot;

==Origins of redskin in English==
The first combination of &quot;red&quot; with &quot;skin&quot;, to form the term &quot;redskin&quot;, is dated to 1769 by Ives Goddard, linguist and curator emeritus in the Department of Anthropology of the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution. Goddard begins by pointing out that what had previously been considered the earliest English use of the term, a letter purported to have been written to an Englishman living in Hadley, Massachusetts in 1699, was spurious.

Goddard&#x27;s alternative etymology is that the term emerged from the speech of Native Americans themselves, and that the origin and use of the term in the late 18th and early 19th century was benign. When it first appeared &quot;it came in the most respectful context and at the highest level. ... These are white people and Indians talking together, with the white people trying to ingratiate themselves&quot;. The word later underwent a process of pejoration, by which it gained a negative connotation. Goddard suggests that &quot;redskin&quot; emerged from French translations of Native American speech in Illinois and Missouri territories in the 18th century. He cites as the earliest example a 1769 set of &quot;talks&quot;, or letters, from chiefs of the Piankeshaw to Col. John Wilkins an English officer at Fort de Chartres. One letter included &quot;, which was translated as &#x27;if any redskins&#x27;, and the second included &quot;, which was translated as &#x27;all the redskins&#x27;. The term here refers to warriors specifically. The term &quot;redskin&quot; enters wider English usage only in the first half of the 19th century. However, in an interview, Goddard admitted that it is impossible to verify whether the French translations of the Miami-Illinois language were accurate.

The term was used in an August 22, 1812, meeting between President James Madison and a delegation of chiefs from western tribes. There, the response of Osage chief &quot;No Ears&quot; (Osage: ) to Madison&#x27;s speech included the statement, &quot;I know the manners of the whites and the red skins,&quot; while French Crow, principal chief of the Wahpekute band of Santee Sioux, was recorded as having said, &quot;I am a red-skin, but what I say is the truth, and notwithstanding I came a long way I am content, but wish to return from here.&quot; However, while these usages may have been earliest, they may not have been disseminated widely. While the 1812 meeting with President Madison was contemporaneously recorded, the records were not published until 2004.

The earliest known appearance of the term in print occurred in multiple periodicals in October 1813 quoting a letter dated August 27, 1813. It concerned an expedition during the War of 1812 led by General Benjamin Howard against Indians in the Illinois and Mississippi territories: &quot;The expedition will be 40 days out, and there is no doubt but we shall have to contend with powerful hordes of red skins ...&quot;

Goddard suggests that a key usage was in a 20 July 1815 speech by Meskwaki Chief Black Thunder at the treaty council at Portage des Sioux, in which he is recorded as stating, &quot;My Father – Restrain your feelings, and hear ca[l]mly what I shall say. I shall tell it to you plainly, I shall not speak with fear and trembling. I feel no fear. I have no cause to fear. I have never injured you, and innocence can feel no fear. I turn to all, red skins and white skins, and challenge an accusation against me.&quot; This speech was published widely, and Goddard speculates that it reached James Fenimore Cooper. In Cooper&#x27;s novels &quot;The Pioneers&quot; (published in 1823) and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1826), both Native American and white characters use the term. These novels were widely distributed, and can be credited with bringing the term to &quot;universal notice&quot;. The first time the term appears in Bartlett&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Americanisms&quot; (in 1858), Goddard notes, the illustrative reference is to &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;.

Johnathan Buffalo, historic preservation director of the Meskwaki, said that in the 1800s &quot;redskins&quot; was used by the tribe for self-identification. Similarly, they identified others as &quot;whiteskins&quot; or &quot;blackskins&quot;. Goddard&#x27;s evidence for indigenous usage includes a 1914 phonetic transcription of the Meskwaki language in which both &#x27;one with brown skin&#x27; and &#x27;one with red skin&#x27; were used to refer to Indians, while &#x27;one with white skin, white person&#x27; was used to refer to Europeans. However, the pre-contact Meskwaki use of &quot;red&quot; in identifying themselves did not refer to skin color, but to their origin stories as the &quot;red-earth&quot; people.

Historian Darren Reid of Coventry University states it is difficult for historians to document anything with certainty since Native Americans, as a non-literate society, did not produce the written sources upon which historians rely. Instead, what is cited as Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Any use of &quot;red&quot; in its various forms, including redskin, by Native Americans to refer to themselves reflected their need to use the language of the times in order to be understood by Europeans.

Sociologist James V. Fenelon makes a more explicit statement that Goddard&#x27;s article is poor scholarship, given that the conclusion of the origin and usage by Natives as &quot;entirely benign&quot; is divorced from the socio-historical realities of hostility and racism from which it emerged.

===Pejoration===

The pejoration of the term &quot;redskin&quot; arguably begins as soon as its introduction in the early 19th century. A linguistic analysis of 42 books published between 1875 and 1930 found that negative contexts for the use of &quot;redskin&quot; were significantly more frequent than positive ones. However, the use of the word &quot;Indian&quot; in a similarly selected set of books was nearly the same, with more frequent negative than positive contexts, indicating that it was not the term &quot;redskin&quot; that was loaded pejoratively, but that its usage represents a generally negative attitude towards its referent. The word was first listed in Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary in 1898 as &quot;often contemptuous.&quot;

Sociologist Irving Lewis Allen suggests that slang identifiers for ethnic groups based upon physical characteristics, including &quot;redskin&quot;, are by nature derogatory, emphasizing the difference between the speaker and the target. However, Luvell Anderson of the University of Memphis, in his paper &quot;Slurring Words&quot;, argues that for a word to be a slur, the word must communicate ideas beyond identifying a target group, and that slurs are offensive because the additional data contained in those words differentiates those individuals from otherwise accepted groups.

Some Native American activists in the 21st century, in contradiction of the etymological evidence discussed above, assert that &quot;redskin&quot; refers directly to the bloody, red scalp or other body part collected for bounty. While this claim is associated in the media with litigants in the Washington Redskins trademark dispute; Amanda Blackhorse and Suzan Shown Harjo, the National Congress of American Indians&#x27; support indicates that the belief is widespread. Goddard denies any direct connection to scalping, and says there is a lack of evidence for the claim. C. Richard King argues that the lack of direct evidence for the assertion does not mean that those making the claim are &quot;wrong to draw an association between a term that empathizes an identity based upon skin color and a history that commodified Native American body parts&quot;.

The term &quot;red-skin&quot; was, in fact used in conjunction with scalp hunting in the 19th century. In 1863 a Winona, Minnesota, newspaper, the &quot;Daily Republican&quot;, printed an announcement: &quot;The state reward for dead Indians has been increased to $200 for every red-skin sent to Purgatory. This sum is more than the dead bodies of all the Indians east of the Red River are worth.&quot; A news story published by the &quot;Atchison Daily Champion&quot; in Atchison, Kansas, on October 9, 1885, tells of the settlers&#x27; &quot;hunt for redskins, with a view of obtaining their scalps&quot;, worth $250. In his early career as the owner of a newspaper in South Dakota, L. Frank Baum wrote an editorial upon the death of Chief Sitting Bull in which he advocates the annihilation of all remaining &quot;redskins&quot; in order to secure the safety of white settlers, and because &quot;better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are.&quot;

When Hollywood westerns were most popular, roughly 1920–1970, the term &quot;redskins&quot; was often used to refer to Native Americans when war was imminent or in progress. In the Washington Redskins trademark dispute, the main issue was the meaning of the term in the period when the trademark registrations were issued, 1967–1990. The linguistic expert for the petitioner, Geoffrey Nunberg, successfully argued that whatever its origins, &quot;redskins&quot; was a slur at that time based upon passages from books and newspapers and movie clips, in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt, derision, condescension, or sentimental paeans to the noble savage. John McWhorter, an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University, had compared the evolution of the name into a slur to that of other racial terms such as &quot;Oriental&quot; which also acquired implied meanings associated with contempt.

==Current use==

In the United States, &quot;redskin&quot; is regarded as a racial epithet by some, but as neutral by others, including some Native Americans. The &quot;American Heritage&quot; style guide advises that &quot;the term redskin evokes an even more objectionable stereotype&quot; than the use of red as a racial adjective by outsiders, while others urge writers to use the term only in a historical context. In modern dictionaries of American English it is labeled &quot;usually offensive&quot;, &quot;disparaging&quot;, &quot;insulting&quot;, or &quot;taboo&quot;.

===Use among Native Americans===
Three predominantly Native American schools use the name for their athletic teams, two of which serve reservations: Red Mesa High School in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona where the student body is 99% Navajo, and Wellpinit High School in Wellpinit, Washington, on the Spokane Indian Reservation. The principal of Red Mesa said in 2014 that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate &quot;the legacy of negativity that the term has created.&quot; In 2014, Wellpinit High School voted to keep the Redskins name. Native American writer and attorney Gyasi Ross compares Native American use of variations of the word &quot;Redskin&quot; with African-American use of variations of the word &quot;nigger&quot;. Use of these terms by some members of minority communities does not mean that these words may be used by outsiders. Ross also notes that while activism on the issue may be from a minority of Native Americans, this is due to most being concerned with more immediate issues, but also says &quot;The presentation of the name &#x27;Redskins&#x27; is problematic for many Native Americans because it identifies Natives in a way that the vast majority of Natives simply don&#x27;t identity ourselves.&quot;

===Sports teams===

Numerous civil rights, educational, athletic, and academic organizations consider any use of native names/symbols by non-native sports teams to be a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping which should be eliminated.

====Washington Redskins====

The controversy regarding Native mascots in general, and use of the name Redskins, was most prominent in the name used by the Washington National Football League team from 1933 to 2020. Public protest of the name began in 1968, with a resolution by the National Congress of American Indians. Native American groups and their supporters argue that since they view the word &quot;redskin&quot; as offensive, it is inappropriate for an NFL team to continue to use it, regardless of whether any offense is intended.

After decades of opposition to the name of the team by Native Americans, major sponsors responded to opponents of systemic racism in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. FedEx, Nike, and PepsiCo advocated changing the name. On July 3, 2020, Washington owner Daniel Snyder and team management announced a process of review of the name. On July 13, 2020, the team made an official statement that their review would result in the retirement of the Redskins name and logo. The new name, Washington Commanders was announced on February 2, 2022.

===== Public opinion =====
The meaning of the term &quot;redskin&quot; was directly relevant to the controversy, with supporters pointing to public opinion polls. Both a 2004 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, and a May 2016 poll by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; produced the same results, that 90% of the self-identified Native American respondents were &quot;not bothered&quot; by the team&#x27;s name. However, in a commentary published soon after the 2004 poll, fifteen Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Similar objections were made after the 2016 poll, mainly with regard to the use of self-identification to select Native American respondents.

A 2020 study at UC Berkeley which found that 49% of self-identified Native Americans responded that the Washington Redskins name was offensive or very offensive, while only 38% were not bothered by it. In addition, for study participants who were heavily engaged in their native or tribal cultures, 67% said they were offended, for young people 60%, and those with tribal affiliations 52%. These results are similar to that found in a study by the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino. A survey of 400 individuals, with 98 individuals positively identified as Native Americans, found that 67% agreed with the statement that &quot;redskins&quot; is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.

=====Trademark case=====

On June 18, 2014, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) cancelled the six trademarks held by the team in a two-to-one decision that held that the term &quot;redskins&quot; is disparaging to a &quot;substantial composite of Native Americans&quot;, and this is demonstrated &quot;by the near complete drop-off in usage of &#x27;redskins&#x27; as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s&quot;. Evidence of disparagement submitted by the petitioners in the TTAB case include the frequent references to &quot;scalping&quot; made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game, and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using &quot;redskin&quot; to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy. A linguistics expert for the team unsuccessfully argued that the name is merely a descriptive term no different than other uses of color to differentiate people by race. The linguistic expert for the petitioners, Geoffrey Nunberg, argued that whatever its origins, &quot;redskins&quot; was a slur at the time of the trademark registrations, based upon the passages from books and newspapers and movie clips, in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt, derision, condescension, or sentimental paeans to the noble savage. Although the USPTO decision was upheld upon appeal, on June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in another case, Matal v. Tam, that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violated the First Amendment&#x27;s Free Speech Clause. Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department withdrew from any further litigation, the legal issue being moot.

====College and secondary school teams====

College teams that formerly used the name changed voluntarily; the University of Utah became the Utah Utes in 1972, Miami University (of Ohio) became the RedHawks in 1997 and Southern Nazarene University became the Crimson Storm in 1998.

The number of high schools using the Redskins name has been in steady decline (some of which closed or merged), with 36 remaining. In a survey conducted in 2013, 40% had local efforts to change the name, while 28 high schools in 18 states had done so. By December 2017, the number of high school &quot;Redskins&quot; had continued to decline from 62 to 49, including four affected by a 2015 California law. In 2019, Teton High School in Idaho and in March 2020 Paw Paw High School in Michigan retired the name. The rate of change increased following the decision by the Washington Football Team, Anderson High School in Ohio and Clinton Community Schools in Michigan changing immediately, followed by La Veta High School in Colorado., Union High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma), Wichita North High School, Cuyahoga Heights High School in Ohio and Saranac High School in Saranac, Michigan. In April, 2022 the Sandusky Community Schools Board of Education voted to retire its mascot at the end of the school year. In June 2024, the Oriskany, New York high school mascot became the Skyhawks.

Some communities have been sharply divided, with long-term residents seeking to keep the mascot while newcomers being open to change. In Driggs, Idaho, the deciding factor was the participation of local tribes advocating change. Other school districts made changes with little opposition. The school board for Cuyahoga Heights Ohio voted unanimously to retire their mascot following the decision by the Cleveland Indians to become the Guardians. The Wichita school board followed the recommendations of a committee appointed to examine the issue.

<doc id="1213674" wikidata="Q1602587" url="?curid=1213674" title="Heliotropism">
<text>Heliotropism, a form of tropism, is the diurnal or seasonal motion of plant parts (flowers or leaves) in response to the direction of the Sun.

The habit of some plants to move in the direction of the Sun, a form of tropism, was already known by the Ancient Greeks. They named one of those plants after that property &quot;Heliotropium&quot;, meaning &quot;sun turn&quot;. The Greeks assumed it to be a passive effect, presumably the loss of fluid on the illuminated side, that did not need further study. Aristotle&#x27;s logic that plants are passive and immobile organisms prevailed. In the 19th century, however, botanists discovered that growth processes in the plant were involved, and conducted increasingly in-depth experiments. A. P. de Candolle called this phenomenon in &quot;any&quot; plant &quot;heliotropism&quot; (1832). It was renamed phototropism in 1892, because it is a response to light rather than to the sun, and because the phototropism of algae in lab studies at that time strongly depended on the brightness (positive phototropic for weak light, and negative phototropic for bright light, like sunlight). A botanist studying this subject in the lab, at the cellular and subcellular level, or using artificial light, is more likely to employ the more abstract word phototropism, a term which includes artificial light as well as natural sunlight. The French scientist Jean-Jacques d&#x27;Ortous de Mairan was one of the first to study heliotropism when he experimented with the &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot; plant. The phenomenon was studied by Charles Darwin and published in his penultimate 1880 book &quot;The Power of Movement in Plants&quot;, a work which included other stimuli to plant movement such as gravity, moisture and touch.

Heliotropic flowers track the Sun&#x27;s motion across the sky from east to west. Daisies or  Bellis perennis close their petals at night but open in the morning light and then follow the sun as the day progresses. During the night, the flowers may assume a random orientation, while at dawn they turn again toward the east where the Sun rises. The motion is performed by motor cells in a flexible segment just below the flower, called a pulvinus. The motor cells are specialized in pumping potassium ions into nearby tissues, changing their turgor pressure. The segment flexes because the motor cells at the shadow side elongate due to a &quot;turgor rise&quot;. This is considered to be turgor-mediated heliotropism. For plant organs that lack pulvini, heliotropism can occur through irreversible cell expansion producing particular growth patterns. This form of heliotropism is considered to be growth-mediated. Heliotropism is a response to light from the Sun.

===Explanations===
Several hypotheses have been proposed for the occurrence of heliotropism in flowers:
* The pollinator attraction hypothesis holds that the warmth associated with full insolation of the flower is a direct reward for pollinators.
* The growth promotion hypothesis assumes that effective absorption of solar energy and the consequent rise in temperature has a favourable effect on pollen germination, growth of the pollen tube and seed production.
* The cooling hypothesis, appropriate to flowers in hot climates, assumes that the position of flowers is adjusted to avoid overheating.

In general, flower heliotropism could increase reproductive success by increasing pollination, fertilization success, and/or seed development, especially in the spring flowers.

Some solar tracking plants are not purely heliotropic: in those plants the change of orientation is an innate circadian motion triggered by light, which continues for one or more periods if the light cycle is interrupted.

Tropical convolvulaceous flowers show a preferred orientation, pointing in the general direction of the sun but not exactly tracking the sun. They demonstrated no diurnal heliotropism but strong seasonal heliotropism. If solar tracking is exact, the sun’s rays would always enter the corolla tube and warm the gynoecium, a process which could be dangerous in a tropical climate. However, by adopting a certain angle away from the solar angle, this is prevented. The trumpet shape of these flowers thus acts as a parasol shading the gynoecium at times of maximum solar radiation, and not allowing the rays to impinge on the gynoecium.
In the case of sunflowers, a common misconception is that sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky throughout the whole life cycle. The uniform alignment of the flowers does result from heliotropism in an earlier development stage, the bud stage, before the appearance of flower heads. The apical bud of the plant will track the Sun during the day from east to west, and then will quickly move west to east overnight as a result of the plant&#x27;s circadian clock. The buds are heliotropic until the end of the bud stage, and finally face east. Phototropic bending can be catalyzed in the hypocotyls of juvenile sunflower seedlings while heliotropic bending in the shoot apex does not start occurring until the later developmental stages of the plant, showing a difference between these two processes. The flower of the sunflower preserves the final orientation of the bud, thus keeping the mature flower facing east.

==Leaf heliotropism==
Leaf heliotropism is the solar tracking behavior of plant leaves. Some plant species have leaves that orient themselves perpendicularly to the sun&#x27;s rays in the morning (&quot;diaheliotropism&quot;), and others have those that orient themselves parallel to these rays at midday (&quot;paraheliotropism&quot;). Floral heliotropism is not necessarily exhibited by the same plants that exhibit leaf heliotropism.

<text>John Arthur “Art” Ingels (sometimes misspelled as Ingles; May 14, 1918 - December 16, 1981) is known as &#x27;the father of karting&#x27;.

In 1956, while he was a race car builder at Kurtis Kraft, a famous builder of Indy race cars during the 1950s, he assembled the first Go-Kart in history out of scrap metal and a surplus West Bend Company two-stroke engine. It was built in his two-car garage in Echo Park, California, (now FIX Coffee Co), and was tested in the Rose Bowl parking lot, where it gained hundreds of enthusiasts.

<doc id="1213678" wikidata="Q5610329" url="?curid=1213678" title="Jack Coe">
<text>Jack Coe (March 11, 1918 – December 16, 1956) was an American Pentecostal evangelist, nicknamed &quot;the man of reckless faith&quot;. He was one of the first faith healers in the United States with a touring tent ministry after World War II. Coe was ordained in the Assemblies of God in 1944, and began to preach while still serving in World War II. In the following twelve years, he traveled the U.S. organizing tent revivals to spread his message. Coe was frequently the center of controversy, preached extensively through the South, and employed some 80 persons.

==Early life==
Jack Coe was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the seventh child of George Henry and Blanche Zoe (Mays) Coe of Pleasantville, Venango County, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma City. His parents later placed him in an orphanage. He left there in 1935 at the age of 17. A heavy drinker, he joined the Army after World War II began. He later claimed to have experienced a miracle during his time in the military that caused him to become a Christian minister. Coe had close ties with the Assemblies of God, and preached several meetings while he was in the Army. He was ordained in 1944, and began his career as an itinerant preacher.

Through an entirely paternal line, Coe was a direct descendant of English colonist Robert Coe who moved to America from England in 1634.

==Tent evangelist and ministries==
Coe was dynamic and enthusiastic in his beliefs. He knew Oral Roberts and was impressed by the size of Roberts&#x27; revival tent. One day Coe went to a Roberts&#x27; tent meeting and measured the tent; he then ordered a larger one. Coe was not bashful about announcing that his tent was the largest in the world; bigger, he claimed, than the one Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus used.

Coe was co-editor of fellow evangelist Gordon Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Healing&quot; magazine until 1950, when he began his own magazine, the &quot;Herald of Healing&quot;. By 1956 its circulation was approximately 250,000. Coe also opened a children&#x27;s orphanage and built a large church building known as the Dallas Revival Center.

==Conflict with denomination and controversy==
Coe&#x27;s revival messages centered upon healing, and he was adamant about not taking medicines and not visiting doctors. In 1953, the Assemblies of God expelled him on the grounds that he was &quot;misleading the public&quot; and &quot;antagonizing Dallas Civil Authorities&quot;. He was also accused of having an extravagant lifestyle and home. Upon hearing that, Coe printed pictures of four large homes owned by some top officials in the Assemblies of God and the smaller homes of himself and three other revivalists. Coe also charged that the Assemblies of God were &quot;fighting divine healing&quot;. Other revivalists soon came into conflict with Pentecostal denominations as well.

==Coe&#x27;s arrest and case dismissed==
Coe taught and preached fervently on divine healing, claiming to have healed visitors to his revivals. In a 1955 revival service in Miami, Florida, Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he had healed their son of polio. Coe then told the parents to remove the boy&#x27;s leg braces. However, the boy was not cured, and removing the braces left him in constant pain. As a result, Coe was arrested on February 6, 1956, and was charged with practicing medicine without a license, a felony in the state of Florida. A judge dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law.

== Death==
In November, a few months after the charges were dismissed, Coe became sick while in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He returned to Texas and underwent a tracheotomy to help his breathing after his muscles became paralyzed. He was diagnosed with bulbar polio, and died a few weeks later at Dallas&#x27; Parkland Hospital on December 16, 1956. He was 38.

After his death, A. A. Allen bought his tent and continued to hold large tent meetings. The Dallas Revival Center was later led by W. V. Grant.

Coe&#x27;s wife, Rev. Juanita Geneva Scott of Lancaster, Texas, died on September 27, 1996, and was buried in Laurel Land Memorial Park in Dallas. Jack Coe&#x27;s son, Jack Coe, Jr., also became a preacher with a healing ministry.

<text>Valentin Danilov (, born 1948) is a Russian physicist, whose research deals with the effect of solar activity on space satellites. In November 2004, he was found guilty and sentenced to 14 years for treason. Many scientists and human rights organizations, both in Russia and worldwide protested the sentence because the information he passed to China was, in fact, declassified in 1992.

Danilov was head of the Thermo-Physics Centre at Krasnoyarsk State Technical University (KTSU). In 1999, he has signed a contract between the KSTU and China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. KSTU was supposed to make a test bench used to emulate effect of space on man-made satellites

In February 2001, Danilov was arrested by FSB, accused of treason, but released on bail October 2, 2002. He was acquitted by a jury of all charges on December 29, 2003.

June 9, 2004 - the Supreme Court of Russia overturned Danilov&#x27;s acquittal of treason. In November 2004, another jury convicted Danilov of espionage. He was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in jail for treason. According to human rights organizations, his sentence was unjustified, because Danilov provided documents to the court showing that all the &quot;secret information&quot; has been in fact declassified.

According to a statement by Amnesty International, &quot;as in the case of Igor Sutyagin, his first trial ended in acquittal; the court concluded that the prosecution had not established violations of the law by Valentin Danilov. In June 2004, the Supreme Court of Russia quashed the verdict of acquittal; following a second, closed trial, Valentin Danilov was convicted of treason (Article 275 of the Russian Criminal Code) and sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment in November 2004.&quot; Danilov was released on parole in Krasnoyarsk in November 2012. He said he would like to continue his scientific career in Novosibirsk.

In 2020, the European Court of Human Rights held that there had been a violation of the right to a fair trial with respect to Danilov.

<text>Zak Ibsen (born June 2, 1972) is an American retired soccer player.

==Career==
Ibsen played college soccer at UCLA. He was a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team and the U.S. National Team. He played in Germany and in the National Professional Soccer League for the Baltimore Spirit as a midfielder before he was traded to the Tampa Bay Terror on January 17, 1996, in exchange for John Garvey. He then joined Major League Soccer in 1996. Selected by New England in the 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft, he also later played for Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Jose. He won MLS titles with the Chicago Fire in 1998 and the San Jose Earthquakes in 2001. During his MLS career Ibsen played in 140 games, scored 6 goals, and had 10 assists. His most notable assist came during MLS Cup 2001, in which he assisted Dwayne De Rosario&#x27;s game-winning goal for the Earthquakes.

Long active in beach soccer, Ibsen played for the United States national beach soccer team at the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup in 2006 and 2007.

== Personal life ==
His professional soccer career ended due to a crystal meth addiction which left him homeless.

<doc id="1213693" wikidata="Q2711175" url="?curid=1213693" title="Chimes of Freedom (song)">
<text>&quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; is a song written and performed by Bob Dylan and featured on his Tom Wilson produced 1964 album &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;. The song depicts the thoughts and feelings of the singer and his companion as they shelter from a lightning storm under a doorway after sunset. The singer expresses his solidarity with the downtrodden and oppressed, believing that the thunder is tolling in sympathy for them.

Initially, critics described the song as showing the influence of the symbolist poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, but more recent biographers of Dylan have linked the origins of the song to verses the songwriter had written as a response to the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. Some commentators and Dylan biographers have assessed the song as one of Dylan&#x27;s most significant compositions, and critic Paul Williams has described it as Dylan&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount.

The song has been covered many times by different artists, including the Byrds, Jefferson Starship, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Bruce Springsteen, and U2.

==Bob Dylan&#x27;s version==
&quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; was written shortly after the release of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot; album in early 1964 during a road trip that he took across America with musician Paul Clayton, journalist Pete Karman, and road manager Victor Maymudes. It was written at about the same time as &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, which author Clinton Heylin has judged to be similarly influenced by the symbolism of Arthur Rimbaud. There are conflicting accounts about when during the trip this song was written. Some Dylan biographers state that he wrote the song on a portable typewriter in the back of a car the day after visiting civil rights activists Bernice Johnson and Cordell Reagon in Atlanta, Georgia. However, a handwritten lyric sheet from the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Toronto, Canada that was reproduced in &quot;The Bob Dylan Scrapbook 1956-1966&quot; indicates that this story cannot be entirely true, since Dylan was in Toronto in late January and early February, before the road trip on which the song was supposedly written occurred. So, although parts of the song may have been written on the road trip, Dylan had started working on the song earlier.

In his memoir, &quot;The Mayor of MacDougal Street&quot;, Dave Van Ronk gave his account of the song&#x27;s origins:

The first public performance of the song took place in early 1964, either at the Civic Auditorium in Denver on February 15, or at the Berkeley Community Theater in Berkeley, California, on February 22. &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; was an important part of Dylan&#x27;s live concert repertoire throughout most of 1964, although by the latter part of that year he had ceased performing it and would not perform the song again until 1987, when he revisited it for concerts with the Grateful Dead and with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

== Recording ==
With Dylan&#x27;s commercial profile on the rise, Columbia was now urging Dylan to release a steady stream of recordings. Upon Dylan&#x27;s return to New York, studio time was quickly scheduled, with Tom Wilson back as producer. The entire album &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; was recorded in one long session on June 9, 1964, with Tom Wilson as producer. During the recording session, Dylan needed seven takes to get &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; right, though it was one of just three songs that Dylan recorded that day which he had previously performed in concert.

The entirety of the first (and only) recording session was held June 9 at Columbia&#x27;s Studio A, located at 799 Seventh Avenue in New York City. According to Heylin, &quot;while polishing off a couple of bottles of Beaujolais,&quot; Dylan recorded 14 original compositions, in a single three-hour session between 7pm and 10pm that night, 11 of which were chosen for the final album. The three that were ultimately rejected were &quot;Denise Denise,&quot; &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; and &quot;Mama, You Been on My Mind.&quot; Nat Hentoff&#x27;s article on Dylan for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, published in late October 1964, includes remarkable descriptions of the June 9 session. Hentoff describes in considerable detail the atmosphere in the CBS recording studio and Dylan&#x27;s own asides and banter with his friends in the studio, with the session&#x27;s producers, and Hentoff himself.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of the song are written in six stanzas of seven verses each. Each of the stanzas shares the same one verse refrain &quot;An&#x27; we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing&quot;. The symbolism of the lyrics makes repeat use of a dual metaphor of freedom represented by the chimes or tolling of a bell on the one hand, and the enlightenment associated with freedom represented by thunder and lightning. The lyrics are located symbolically in the darkness after sunset (after &quot;sundown&quot;) up until &quot;midnight&#x27;s&quot; tolling of the chimes on the same evening. The initial verses of the song describe a fierce and unforgiving storm giving way at the end of the song to a partial lifting of the mist. The narrative of the song&#x27;s lyrics has been described as depicting the point of view of the underprivileged and indigent seeking freedom.

==Release==
Despite the song&#x27;s appeal to cover artists, it has appeared sparingly on Dylan&#x27;s compilation and live albums. It was, however, included on the 1967 European compilation album &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits 2&quot;. A very early live performance of the song, at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, in May 1964, was released in 2018 on &quot;Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections&quot;. In 1993 Dylan played the song in front of the Lincoln Memorial as part of Bill Clinton&#x27;s first inauguration as U.S. president.

A version sung by Dylan and Joan Osborne in 1999 appears on the original television soundtrack album of the film titled &quot;The 60&#x27;s&quot;. A recording of Dylan performing the song at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival was included on the 2005 album &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack&quot;. The same performance can also be seen on the 2007 DVD &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror: Live at Newport Folk Festival 1963-1965.&quot; In 2009, Dylan continued to perform &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; in concert, although he did not play the song live during the 23 years between late 1964 and 1987.

&quot;Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International&quot; is a 4-CD charity compilation album featuring new recordings of 73 compositions by Bob Dylan by multiple artists, released on January 24, 2012. The set includes Dylan&#x27;s original 1964 recording of the title song. Proceeds from the album were donated to the human rights organization Amnesty International. It debuted in the U.S at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 22,000 copies sold.

==Reception and critical comments==
&quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; has been widely discussed by Dylan&#x27;s many interpreters, including biographers, journalists, academics and music historians.

Critic Paul Williams has described the song as Dylan&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount. The song is a lyrical expression of feelings evoked while watching a lightning storm. The singer and a companion are caught in a thunderstorm in mid-evening and the pair of them duck into a doorway, where they are both transfixed by one lightning flash after another. The natural phenomena of thunder and lightning appear to take on auditory and ultimately emotional aspects to the singer, with the thunder experienced as the tolling of bells and the lightning bolts appearing as chimes. Eventually, the sights and sounds in the sky become intermixed in the mind of the singer, as evidenced by the lines:

Over the course of the song, the sky and mist begin to partially clear and the lyrics can be interpreted as a proclamation of the hope that as the sky clears in the progress of the difficult night, that all the world&#x27;s people will endure their setbacks and eventually proclaim their successful survival to the sound of the chimes of freedom.

In his 2003 book, &quot;Chimes of Freedom: The Politics of Bob Dylan&#x27;s Art&quot;, Mike Marqusee notes that the song marks a transition between Dylan&#x27;s earlier protest song style (a litany of the down-trodden and oppressed, in the second half of each verse) and his later more free-flowing poetic style (the fusion of images of lightning, storm and bells in the first half). In this later style, which is influenced by 19th century French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud, the poetry is more allusive, filled with &quot;chains of flashing images.&quot; In this song, rather than support a specific cause as in his earlier protest songs, he finds solidarity with all people who are downtrodden or otherwise treated unjustly, including unwed mothers, the disabled, refugees, outcasts, those unfairly jailed, &quot;the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,&quot; and, in the final verse, &quot;the countless confused, accused, misused, strung out ones and worse&quot; and &quot;every hung-up person in the whole wide universe.&quot; By having the chimes of freedom toll for both rebels and rakes, the song is more inclusive in its sympathies than previous protest songs, such as &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27;&quot;, written just the prior year. After &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, Dylan&#x27;s protest songs no longer depicted social reality in the black and white terms which he renounced in &quot;My Back Pages&quot;, but rather use satirical surrealism to make their points.

In addition to Rimbaud&#x27;s symbolism, Oliver Hopkins has suggested that the song also shows the influence of the alliterative poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the poetic vision of William Blake, and the violent drama, mixed with compassionate and romantic language, of William Shakespeare. Dylan had used rain in a symbolic manner in earlier songs, notably &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s A-Gonna Fall&quot;.

Clinton Heylin has suggested the assassination of U.S. President, John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 as a possible inspiration for Dylan&#x27;s song, although Dylan has denied that this is the case. Dylan drafted a number of poems after Kennedy&#x27;s death on November 22, 1963. Heylin suggests one of those poems, a six-line piece, seems to contain the genesis of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;:
Kennedy was killed on a Friday, and the cathedral bells in the poem have been interpreted as the church bells announcing his death. Heylin suggests that using a storm as a metaphor for the death of a president is comparable to Shakespeare&#x27;s use of a storm in &quot;King Lear&quot;. By the time Dylan wrote the first draft of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; the following February, it contained many of the elements of his poem from the end of Autumn after the death of the president, except that the crippled ones and the blind were changed to &quot;guardians and protectors of the mind.&quot; In addition, the cathedral bells had become the &quot;chimes of freedom flashing&quot;, as seen by two lovers who are sheltering in a cathedral doorway.

In his biography of Dylan, &quot;Bob Dylan in America&quot;, Sean Wilentz comments that shortly before Dylan met poet Allen Ginsberg, &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; started to come to form; later in 1964 and 1965, they would continue to influence each other. Wilentz states:

Dylan had already been experimenting with writing free verse, without intending that it would serve him as lyrics. Not long before he met Ginsberg, he poured out a poem about the day of Kennedy&#x27;s murder... Pulled together, the lines would form part of what Dylan called the &#x27;chain of flashing images&#x27; that soon went into &#x27;Chimes of Freedom&#x27;—marking both Dylan&#x27;s reconnection of those aesthetics and the transformation of those aesthetics into song. And in 1964 and 1965, Ginsberg and Dylan influenced each other as both of them recast their public images and their art.

Wilentz points out that Dylan&#x27;s 1964 album &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;, which included &quot;Chimes&quot;, did not crack the Top 40 list; whereas &quot;The Times They Are A Changin&quot;, released earlier in 1964, reached number 20 on the album chart.

In &quot;Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet&quot;, Seth Rogovy called the song Dylan&#x27;s &quot;supreme poetic achievement.&quot; Rogovy described the song&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot; scene: […] a couple takes refuge in a doorway of a church during a thurderstorm. Period. But never has a storm been so dynamically, so &quot;electrically&quot;, described. In six eight-line stanzas, Dylan paints a hallucinatory vision, a sensual display of lightning piercing darkness, revealing an unjust world and a world of redemption. Wrapped up in the song is all that has come before: the civil right symbolism of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, the apolcalyptic surrealism of &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s a- Gonna Fall&quot;, the tolling of a new day in &quot;The Times They Are a- Changin&#x27;.&quot;

Rogovy suggests an answer to one of the main questions asked in Dylan&#x27;s lyrics by stating: &quot;...The answer was blowin&#x27; in the wind out in the night in question; the answer is in poetry; the answer, my friend, is in a transcendent vision of universal freedom and justice for all&quot;.

In his 2012 book &quot;The Lives of Bob Dylan&quot;, Ian Bell follows Heylin in speculating that the genesis of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; might lie in the verses Dylan wrote at the time of the Kennedy assassination, which contain the line &quot;as cathedral bells were gently burnin&quot;. Bell also notes that the song echoes the imagery of &quot;The Drunken Boat /Le Bateau ivre&quot; by Arthur Rimbaud: &quot;I know skies split by lightning, waterspouts/ And undertows, and tides: I know the night/ And dawn exulting like a crowd of doves&quot;.

Bell asserts that &quot;Chimes&quot; was &quot;certainly something new, but also something flawed&quot;. He describes the song as both thrilling and &quot;loosely and horribly overwritten&quot;. Bell suggests the theme of the song is that liberty took many forms, personal and political, civic and artistic, spiritual and physical. The significance of &quot;Chimes&quot; for Bell is that, although the song is too over-wrought and self-conscious to be a total success, it showed Dylan demolishing the barrier between poetry and song:

Anyone reading &quot;Chimes&quot; on the tyrannical page might pause before calling it a poem. Anyone listening would hesitate to call it just a song in the manner of &quot;She Loves You&quot; or anything written for the mass market in the 20th century . If it wasn&#x27;t poetry, what was Dylan doing?

In &quot;In Search of the Real Bob Dylan&quot;, David Dalton, one of the founding editors of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, commented that the song was written at the same time as &quot;Mr Tambourine Man&quot;. Dalton gives a literary reading to the lyrics of &quot;Chimes&quot; as worthy of significant literary merit stating: &quot;Dylan begins to type, &#x27;Electric light still struck like arrows&#x27;... Lightning is an agent of change in classic American literature: it is the storm after which everything changes—the lightning storm in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, the storm in &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, and the one in &quot;On the Road&quot;, just outside New Orleans. &#x27;Lightning that liquifies the bones of the world,&#x27; William Burroughs called it.&quot; Dalton continues with a comparison of Dylan&#x27;s writing of the lyrics in &quot;Chimes&quot; to Jack Kerouac and states: &quot;The scenes in &#x27;Chimes of Freedom&#x27; are lit up as if by strobe light—the way the Bible was written, they say, in brilliantly illuminated pictures. Dylan uses a cinematic method of writing, like Kerouac&#x27;s—with slow motion jump cuts, and freeze frames.&quot;

==Cover versions==
===The Byrds&#x27; version===

The Byrds released a version of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; on their 1965 debut album, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. The song was the last track to be recorded for the album, but the recording session was marred by conflict. After the band had completed the song&#x27;s instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he was not going to sing on the recording and was quitting the studio for the day. The reason for Crosby&#x27;s refusal to sing the song has never been fully explained, but the fight between the guitarist and the band&#x27;s manager, record producer Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby&#x27;s chest, telling him, &quot;The only way you&#x27;re going to get through that door is over my dead body...You&#x27;re going to stay in this room until you do the vocal.&quot; According to a number of people in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears, but finally completed the song&#x27;s harmony part with sterling results. Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer &quot;got it all out and sang like an angel.&quot;

The song went on to become a staple of the Byrds&#x27; live concert repertoire, until their breakup in 1973. The band also performed the song on the television programs &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; and &quot;Shindig!&quot;, and included it in their performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. The Byrds&#x27; performance of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; at Monterey can be seen in the 2002 &quot;The Complete Monterey Pop Festival&quot; DVD box set.

The song was also performed by a reformed line-up of the Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989. In addition to its appearance on &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; has appeared on several Byrds&#x27; compilation albums, including &quot;The Byrds&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;The Byrds Play Dylan&quot;, &quot;The Very Best of The Byrds&quot;, and &quot;The Essential Byrds&quot;.

===Other covers===
&quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; has also been covered by artists as diverse as Phil Carmen, Jefferson Starship, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Martyn Joseph, Joan Osborne, Starry Eyed and Laughing, Bruce Springsteen, Warren Zevon, and The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. Although U2 have never released a recording of the song, they played it live in concert during the late 1980s. Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s cover version reached #16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1988, though it was never released as a single. It was recorded in Stockholm on July 3, 1988, when Springsteen performed it during his Tunnel of Love Express tour. Springsteen used the performance to announce before a worldwide radio audience his role in the upcoming Human Rights Now! tour to benefit Amnesty International and mark the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The song was subsequently released as the title track of the live &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; EP. Springsteen&#x27;s performance has been described as rousing and fervent, transforming the song into a ringing anthem for the full E Street Band, without losing the power of the words evident in Dylan&#x27;s solo performance. On the Human Rights Now! tour itself, Springsteen led a group performance of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; featuring the other artists on the tour: Tracy Chapman, Sting, Peter Gabriel, and Youssou N&#x27;Dour, with each taking turns on the song&#x27;s verses.

On 19 July 1988, Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band played the song live when performing a concert in East Berlin. Among the audience, many interpreted the song lyrics as wishing for the fall of the GDR.

The Senegalese musician Youssou N&#x27;Dour recorded a cover version of the song, in which he treats the song as an anthem for the many people in Africa struggling to survive. Jefferson Starship covered the song on their 2008 release, &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Tree of Liberty&quot;, with Paul Kantner, David Freiberg, and Cathy Richardson on vocals. The melody of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; was deliberately borrowed by Billy Bragg for the song &quot;Ideology&quot;, from his third album, &quot;Talking with the Taxman about Poetry&quot;, with Bragg&#x27;s chorus &quot;above the sound of ideologies clashing&quot; echoing Dylan&#x27;s &quot;we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing&quot;. In addition, the Bon Jovi song &quot;Bells of Freedom&quot;, from their &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; album, is somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; in structure. Neil Young&#x27;s song &quot;Flags of Freedom&quot; from his &quot;Living with War&quot; album mentions Dylan by name and melodically recalls the tune and verse structure of &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, though Young is listed as the song&#x27;s only writer. The British band Starry Eyed and Laughing took their name from the opening line of the song&#x27;s final verse.

&quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; is one of seven Dylan songs whose lyrics were reset as a modern classical music arrangement for soprano and piano (or orchestra) by John Corigliano for his song cycle &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Poems of Bob Dylan&quot;.

<text>George Booth (June 28, 1926 – November 1, 2022) was an American cartoonist who worked for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. His cartoons usually featured an older everyman, everywoman, or everycouple beset by modern complexity, perplexing each other, or interacting with cats and dogs.

==Life and career==
Born in Cainsville, Missouri, on June 28, 1926, Booth was the son of schoolteachers; his mother, Irma (née Swindle) Booth (1903–1989), was also a musician and fine artist and cartoonist, and his father, William Earl &quot;Billy&quot; Booth (1898–1982), became a school administrator in Fairfax, Missouri, where Booth grew up on a farm.

Drafted into the United States Marine Corps in 1944, Booth was invited to re-enlist and join the Corps&#x27; &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine as a staff cartoonist; when re-drafted for the Korean War, he was ordered back to &quot;Leatherneck&quot;.

As a civilian, Booth moved to New York City where he struggled as an artist, married, then worked as an art director in the magazine world. He also worked on the comic strip &quot;Spot&quot; in 1956–1957.

Fed up, Booth quit and pursued cartooning full-time, beginning successfully in 1969, with the sale of his first &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoon. One signature element of Booth&#x27;s generally messy or run-down interiors is a ceiling light bulb on a cord pulled by another cord attached to an electrical appliance such as a toaster. Most of the household features in his cartoons were drawn from his own home. He described one of his cats, adopted later in his career, as being &quot;more like my drawing than the drawings ... when he lies down, his back feet go out in backstraight out.&quot;

Booth also created the comic strip &quot;Local Item&quot; in 1986–1987.

==Personal life==
Booth lived for many years in Stony Brook, New York, with his wife Dione (d. 2022), whom he married in 1958. They later lived in Brooklyn, where he continued to draw cartoons and collect artwork from local artists.

Booth died from complications of dementia at home in Brooklyn, on November 1, 2022, at age 96, six days after Dione died of pancreatic cancer on October 26 at age 85. His daughter, Sarah, said, &quot;All his life, he&#x27;d sit in his studio and come up with captions and laugh at his own work.&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; honored Booth one month after his death, reprinting a sketch entitled &quot;Believe&quot; as the cover of the December 19th edition of the magazine.

==Awards==
The National Cartoonists Society recognized his work with the Gag Cartoon Award in 1993 and the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010.

==Publications==
Booth&#x27;s cartoons have been collected in the following books:

*&quot;Think Good Thoughts About a Pussycat&quot; (1975)
*&quot;Rehearsal&#x27;s Off!&quot; (1976)
*&quot;Pussycats Need Love, Too&quot; (1981)
*&quot;A Friend Is Friendly&quot; (1981)
*&quot;Omnibooth: The Best of George Booth&quot; (1984)

<doc id="1213698" wikidata="Q1402799" url="?curid=1213698" title="Flag of Chicago">
<text>The flag of Chicago consists of two light blue horizontal bars, or stripes, on a field of white, each bar one-sixth the height of the full flag, and placed slightly less than one-sixth of the way from the top and bottom. Four bright red stars, with six sharp points each, are set side by side, close together, in the middle third of the flag&#x27;s surface.
== Symbolism ==
=== Bars ===
The three white background areas of the flag represent, from top to bottom, the North, West, and South sides of the city. The top blue bar represents Lake Michigan and the North Branch of the Chicago River. The bottom blue bar represents the South Branch of the river and the &quot;Great Canal&quot;, over the Chicago Portage. The light blue of the flag&#x27;s two bars is variously called sky blue or pale blue; in a 1917 article of a speech by designer Wallace Rice, it was called &quot;the color of water&quot;. 

=== Stars ===

There are four red six-pointed stars on the center white bar. Six-pointed stars are used because five-pointed stars represent sovereign states and because the star as designed was found on no other known flags as of 1917. From the hoist outwards, the stars represent: 

* Original to the 1917 flag: This star stands for the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Its six points symbolize transportation, labor, commerce, finance, populousness, and salubrity (health). 
* Original to the 1917 flag: This star symbolizes the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893. Its six points represent the virtues of religion, education, aesthetics, justice, beneficence, and civic pride. 
* Added in 1933: This star represents the Century of Progress Exposition (1933–34). Its points refer to: Chicago&#x27;s status as the United States&#x27; second largest city at the time of the star&#x27;s addition (Chicago became third largest in a 1990 census when passed by Los Angeles); Chicago&#x27;s Latin motto, &quot;&quot; (&quot;City in a garden&quot;); Chicago&#x27;s &quot;I Will&quot; motto; the Great Central Marketplace; Wonder City; and Convention City.
* Added in 1939: Commemorates Fort Dearborn, and its six points stand for political entities the Chicago region has belonged to and the flags that have flown over the area: France, 1693; Great Britain, 1763; Virginia, 1778; the Northwest Territory, 1789; Indiana Territory, 1802; and Illinois (territory, 1809, and state, since 1818).

Additional stars have been proposed, with varying degrees of seriousness. The following reasons have been suggested for possible additions of a fifth star:

====Fifth Star====

* A fifth star could represent Chicago&#x27;s contribution to the nuclear age (see Metallurgical Laboratory), an idea first suggested in a 1940s letter published by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and later championed by Mayor Richard J. Daley in the 1960s.
* In the 1980s, a star was proposed in honor of Harold Washington, the first African-American mayor of Chicago.
* The 1992 Chicago flood was suggested as an additional natural disaster deserving of a star, in line with the existing star for the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. Another fifth star was in the works from a group of Chicago real estate professionals to represent Chicago&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit in the early 1990s.
* When Chicago was bidding to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Bid Committee proposed that a fifth star be added to the flag in commemoration, but the bid was won instead by Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
* Anne Burke, Tim Shriver, and others have proposed adding a fifth star to commemorate the Special Olympics, which were founded in Chicago.
* Other sports-related suggestions include recognizing the Chicago Bulls&#x27; dominance of the National Basketball Association in the 1990s and a proposal for a fifth star if the Chicago Cubs should ever win the World Series, which did not happen between their long drought of series wins in 1908, up to 2016.
* The Chicago History Museum has an ongoing exhibition where the public is encouraged to vote for a potential fifth star.
* Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot suggested that Chicago&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic could warrant adding a fifth star to Chicago&#x27;s flag.

== Unlawful private use ==
Per the Municipal Code of Chicago, it is unlawful to use the flag, or any imitation or design thereof, except for the usual and customary purposes of decoration or display. Causing to be displayed on the flag, any letter, word, legend, or device not provided for in the Code is also prohibited. Violators are subject to fines between $5.00 and $25.00 for each offense. However, the United States Constitution, via its first and fourteenth amendments, prohibits this section from being enforced (&quot;Street v. New York&quot;).

== History ==
===&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; contest===
The issue of the city flag came into focus during the preparations for the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. In 1892, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; offered a one-hundred-dollar prize for the best suggestion of a municipal color or combination of colors that would symbolize the city. 829 projects were submitted to the competition and the winner was a Danish architect who’d recently moved to Chicago, to design buildings for the World’s Fair, Alfred Råvad (who also used an Americanized spelling of his name, Roewad). Råvada&#x27;s design proposed red and white as the city&#x27;s colors and a symbol in the shape of a horizontal letter &quot;Y&quot;, representing the Chicago River, whose branches create this branching pattern. The Råvada design became only an unofficial flag and was never confirmed by any relevant resolution, but ultimately became used in the municipal device.

===Wallace Rice&#x27;s design ===

In 1915, Mayor William Hale Thompson appointed a municipal flag commission chaired by Alderman James A. Kearns. Among the commission members were wealthy industrialist Charles Deering and impressionist painter Lawton S. Parker. Parker asked lecturer and poet Wallace Rice to develop the rules for an open public competition for the best flag design. Over a thousand entries were received. 

The flag was adopted in 1917 after the design by Wallace Rice won a City Council sponsored competition. It initially had two stars until 1933, when a third was added. The four-star version has existed since 1939. The three sections of the white field and the two bars represent geographical features of the city, the stars symbolize historical events, and the points of the stars represent important virtues or concepts. The historic events represented by the stars are the establishment of Fort Dearborn, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, and Century of Progress Exposition of 1933–34.

In 1928, Mayor William Hale Thompson proposed that the stars on Chicago&#x27;s flag should be changed from six-pointed to five-pointed, as he felt five-pointed stars were more &quot;American&quot;. Although the change was unanimously approved by City Council on February 15, 1928, the description of the new design never made it into the city&#x27;s ordinance books. When the Council voted to add the third star to Chicago&#x27;s flag in 1933, the vote ended any uncertainty on the shape of the stars by reconfirming them as six-pointed. 

The 318th Cavalry Regiment incorporated the flag into their insignia.

In a 2004 review by the North American Vexillological Association of 150 American city flags, the Chicago city flag was ranked second-best with a rating of 9.03 out of 10, behind only the flag of Washington, D.C.

<text>Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner (May 27, 1885 – February 12, 1961), commonly known as Kelly Turner, was an admiral of the United States Navy during the Second World War, where he commanded the Amphibious Force in the Pacific theater. Turner was also responsible for the creation of the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) in 1942 that were an early precursor to the United States Navy SEALs.

==Early life and career==
Richmond Turner was born in Portland, Oregon on May 27, 1885, to Enoch and Laura Frances (née Kelly) Turner. His father alternated between being a rancher and farmer, and working as a printer in both Portland (for &quot;The Oregonian&quot; with his older brother Thomas) and Stockton, California (where he owned a small print shop). The young Richmond spent most of his childhood in and around Stockton, with a brief stop in Santa Ana, and he graduated from Stockton High School in 1904.

He was appointed to the Naval Academy from California&#x27;s sixth district, his name put forward by Congressman James C. Needham, in 1904. He graduated on June 5, 1908 and served in several ships over the next four years. Among his classmates were several future admirals including: Harry A. Badt, Paul H. Bastedo, John R. Beardall, Abel T. Bidwell, Joseph J. Broshek, Arthur S. Carpender, Jules James, Walter K. Kilpatrick, James L. Kauffman, Thomas C. Kinkaid, Willis A. Lee Jr., William R. Munroe, William R. Purnell, Francis W. Rockwell, and John F. Shafroth Jr..

On August 3, 1910, he married Harriet &quot;Hattie&quot; Sterling in Stockton.

In 1913, Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Turner briefly held command of the destroyer . After receiving instruction in ordnance engineering and serving on board the gunboat , he was assigned to the battleships , and during 1916–19. From 1919 to 1922, Lieutenant Commander Turner was an ordnance officer at the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C. He then was gunnery officer of the battleship , fleet gunnery officer on the Staff of Commander Scouting Fleet and commanding officer of the destroyer .

After his promotion to the rank of commander in 1925, Turner served with the Bureau of Ordnance at the Navy Department. In 1927, he received flight training at Pensacola, Florida, was designated as a naval aviator, and a year later became commanding officer of the seaplane tender and commander, Aircraft Squadrons, Asiatic Fleet. He had further aviation-related assignments into the 1930s and was executive officer of the aircraft carrier in 1933–34. Captain Turner attended the Naval War College and served on that institution&#x27;s staff in 1935–38 as head of the Strategy faculty.

Turner&#x27;s last single ship command was the heavy cruiser , on a diplomatic mission to Japan in 1939. During his service with that vessel, &quot;Astoria&quot;, the body of deceased Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Hiroshi Saito was returned to Japan. Saito died of tuberculosis in February 1939. Following World War II, Turner received Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd Class by the Emperor of Japan.

Turner was Director of War Plans in Washington, D.C., in 1940–41 and was promoted to rear admiral January 1941.

==Responsibility for Pearl Harbor==
As Director of War Plans in the office of Chief of Naval Operations, Captain Turner became the Naval Member of the Joint Planning Committee of the Joint Board. Turner and Colonel Joseph T. McNarney, Air Corps, U.S. Army wrote &quot;Study of the Immediate Problems concerning Involvement in War&quot; in late December 1940. This led to Plan D, a strong offensive war in the Atlantic and a defensive war in the Pacific. This evolved into U.S. war plan &quot;Rainbow Five&quot;.

On November 25, 1941, Turner drafted a dispatch to the Commander in Chief of the Asiatic Fleet for release by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), which contained the words: &quot;I consider it probable that this next Japanese aggression may cause an outbreak of hostilities between the U.S. and Japan.&quot; CNO Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark took this message to President Roosevelt, who in relaying it to his High Commissioner to the Philippines softened the judgment words &quot;probable&quot; to &quot;possible&quot; and &quot;may&quot; to &quot;might.&quot; Roosevelt also added the bad guess: &quot;Advance against Thailand seems the most probable.&quot;

The Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, was highly aware of the threat of surprise Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. The final and most important warning was sent from Washington to Pearl Harbor and other Pacific outposts on November 27, 1941. It was specifically designated as a &quot;war warning.&quot;

Turner made the decision not to send Kimmel details of the intercepted Japanese diplomatic communications although they pointed strongly to an imminent air or sea attack on the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s base at Pearl Harbor. Kimmel testified after the war that had he known of these communications, he would have maintained a much higher level of alert, and the fleet would not have been taken by surprise by the Japanese attack. As historian of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Professor Gordon Prange, wrote in &quot;Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History&quot; that was correct, even allowing for Kimmel&#x27;s desire to exculpate himself: &quot;If Turner thought a Japanese raid on Hawaii ... to be a 50-percent chance, it was his clear duty to say so plainly in his directive to Kimmel ... He won the battle for dominance of War Plans over Intelligence, and had to abide by the consequences. If his estimates had enabled the U.S. to fend off ... the Japanese threat at Pearl Harbor, Turner would deserve the appreciation of a grateful nation. By the same token, he could not justly avoid his share of the blame for failure.&quot;

Vice Admiral Homer N. Wallin wrote a much more comprehensive analysis of the reasons for the U.S. defeat at Pearl Harbor. See also Rear Admiral Edwin T. Layton, Kimmel&#x27;s chief intelligence officer, and his book, &quot;And I Was There&quot;. &quot;To anyone who is familiar with the mutinous conditions provoked by Turner&#x27;s interference in the intelligence process . . .throughout 1941, (Turner&#x27;s) barefaced denial of any responsibility for its consequences was as outrageous as it was untrue.&quot; Page 142.

Admiral Turner testified to the Roberts Commission on January 19, 1942, the Admiral Thomas C. Hart Inquiry on the April 3rd and 4th, 1944, the Navy Court of Inquiry headed by Admiral Orin G. Murfin on September 15, 1944 and the Joint Congressional Committee Investigating Pearl Harbor in 1946.

==World War II==
In December 1941, Turner was appointed assistant chief of staff to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (a new position created after Pearl Harbor for Admiral Ernest King) and served until June 1942. He was then sent to the Pacific to take command of the Amphibious Force, South Pacific Force. Over the next three years, he held a variety of senior Amphibious Force commands as a rear admiral and vice admiral. He helped plan and execute amphibious operations against enemy positions in the south, central and western Pacific. He would have commanded the amphibious component of the invasion of Japan.

For the Guadalcanal Campaign, Rear Admiral Turner was Commander, Amphibious Force South Pacific (ComPhibForSoPac), also known as Task Force 62 which included 9 Groups, including Landing Force, Major General Alexander Vandegrift and Screening Group, Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, Royal Navy. He successfully fought the five-month campaign to victory which included the galling defeat at Savo Island.

For the assault on the Russell Islands, Rear Admiral Turner, , was named as the Commander of the Joint Force designated Task Force 61, with the Commanding General 43rd Infantry Division, Major General John H. Hester, U.S. Army, being the Commander Landing Force. For the assault on the New Georgia Groups of Islands, Rear Admiral Turner, , was named as the Commander Task Force 31 which included New Georgia Occupation Force, Major General Hester.

For the assault on Tarawa and Makin, Rear Admiral Turner was named as the Commander, Assault Force Task Force 51, which included 10 Groups, including Northern Attack Force for Makin and Southern Attack Force for Tarawa, Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill.

At Tarawa: &quot;Rear Admiral Turner, the Task Force Commander and Immediate Senior in Command, was well over the horizon and busy with the problems of Makin. Vice Admiral Spruance, the Commander Central Pacific Force, was present at Tarawa in the , but with that quality which endeared him to all his subordinates, did not undertake to kibitz on the minute-by-minute performance of the local Task Force or Task Group Commanders. To Rear Admiral Harry Hill belongs full credit for a great and hard-fought victory at Tarawa.&quot;

For the assault on the Marshall Islands, Roi-Namur and Kwajalein, Rear Admiral Turner was the Commander, Joint Expeditionary Force, Task Force 51, which included 3 Task Forces and 9 Task Groups.

As a result of his leadership in those many amphibious assaults, Turner was promoted to vice admiral on March 7, 1944.

For the assaults on Tinian, Guam and Saipan, Vice Admiral Turner was the Commander, Joint Expeditionary Force, Task Force 51, which included the Northern and Southern Task Forces, Expeditionary Task Force, Lt. General Holland Smith and 6 Task Groups.

For the assault on Iwo Jima, Vice Admiral Turner was the Commander, Joint Expeditionary Force, Task Force 50, which included the Attack Force, Rear Admiral Hill, and Expeditionary Task Force, Lt. General Smith.

At the Battle of Okinawa Turner commanded Task Force 51 which included the Northern Attack Force, Rear Admiral Lawrence Fairfax Reifsnider, the Southern Attack Force, Rear Admiral Hill, Expeditionary Troops, Lt. General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., Western Island Attack Group, Rear Admiral Ingolf N. Kiland, Amphibious Support Force Rear Admiral William H. P. Blandy and Gunfire and Covering Force, Rear Admiral Morton Deyo. At the end of the Battle of Okinawa the Amphibious Forces under Admiral Turner&#x27;s command were manned by 657,000 officers and men.

On May 24, 1945, Richmond Kelly Turner was promoted to full admiral. Had the Pacific war continued, he would have commanded the amphibious component of the invasion of Japan. Under Admiral Turner&#x27;s command, there were to be 2,700 ships and craft in the Kyushu operation. There had been 1,213 ships and craft under his command for the Okinawa operation, 435 for the Marianas operation and 51 at Guadalcanal.

Turner was present during the Japanese surrender on board the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; (BB-63) on September 2, 1945.

==Later life==

After World War II, Admiral Turner served on the Navy Department&#x27;s General Board and was U.S. Naval Representative on the United Nations Military Staff Committee. He retired from active duty in July 1947.

Admiral Turner died in Monterey, California, on February 12, 1961. He is buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California, alongside his wife and Admirals Chester Nimitz, Raymond A. Spruance, and Charles A. Lockwood, an arrangement made by all of them while living.

==Personal life==
He was the brother of the socialist and pacifist writer John Kenneth Turner.

===Personality===
Admiral Turner was known in his surrounding by his complicated personality and furious temper. Nicknamed &quot;Terrible Turner,&quot; many of his subordinates and colleagues recognized his command abilities, but on the other hand criticized his manners, heavy drinking and pedantry. When Admiral Chester Nimitz accepted Turner as commander of his assault force, Nimitz dryly said of the assignment that Turner was &quot;brilliant, caustic, arrogant, and tactless – just the man for the job&quot;.

Future Marine general Robert E. Hogaboom, who served as his assistant chief of staff for operations, describes him as:

General Nathan Twining, who served as chief of staff of the Allied air forces in South Pacific during World War II, described Turner as:

===Honors and depictions===
The destroyer leader (later classified guided missile cruiser) (DLG-20/CG-20) in service from 1964 to 1995 was named in honor of Admiral Turner.

Turner appears in &quot;To the Shores of Iwo Jima&quot;, a documentary short film depicting the American assault on the Japanese-held island of Iwo Jima and the massive battle that raged on that key island in the Allied advance on Japan.

Turner was portrayed by actor Stuart Randall in the film &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot;.

<text>Buyeo Pung (扶餘豊, 623–668) was a prince of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was son of the last king, Uija of Baekje. When Baekje fell to the Silla–Tang alliance in 660, he was a hostage who mortgaged the alliance of Baekje with Japan. He was shortly unofficially proclaimed king.

He came back with a Japanese army and Yamato general Abe no Hirafu to revive the country. General Boksin of the Baekje revival forces gave him the title King Pungjang (). He joined forces with the Baekje resistance led by general Boksin. In 663, however, the Baekje resistance and Japan lost the Battle of Baekgang to the army of Tang and Silla, and Baekje collapsed. The prince fled to neighboring Goguryeo. When Goguryeo collapsed, he was captured by the Tang army and sent to southern China in exile. His later life is unknown.

One of his brothers, Zenkō (善光 or 禅広), settled in Japan and was given the family name Kudara no Konikishi (百濟王; king of Baekje) by the emperor of Japan.

<text>The Next Big Thing was a radio series produced at WNYC in New York City, and syndicated nationally in the U.S. by Public Radio International. It was offered nationally after the success of PRI&#x27;s Chicago-based &quot;This American Life&quot;, which it somewhat resembles; one distinction is that &quot;TNBT&quot; is more likely to be given over to one documentary or radio drama segment per episode. This show is no longer airing on WNYC, where it began in 1999 and transmitted its last episode in January, 2006. Archives are still available on the WNYC website.

The West Bend Company manufactured aluminum cookware and electrical appliances, but also made two-stroke cycle engines, including outboard boat motors. Art Ingels used a surplus West Bend engine to power the first kart. Clayton Jacobson II used a West Bend 2-stroke motor to power the first stand-up Jet Ski. The engine division of West Bend was sold to Chrysler, then to Brunswick, and finally to US Motor Power.

In 2001, Regal Ware, Inc. of Kewaskum, Wisconsin, acquired certain assets of the West Bend Company. In 2003, Regal Ware sold the Small Kitchen Appliance Division of the West Bend Company to Focus Products Group LLC. The Small Kitchen Appliance Division is now known as West Bend Housewares.

Regal Ware retained the West Bend Cookware Division and product lines of the West Bend Company; and continues to manufacture the cookware products in West Bend and Kewaskum, Wisconsin, under the brand names Lifetime and Royal Queen. This represents more than 100 years of continuous manufacture of West Bend Cookware product lines in West Bend, Wisconsin.

<doc id="1213726" wikidata="Q3270434" url="?curid=1213726" title="Liquid rocket booster">
<text>A liquid rocket [[booster (rocketry)|booster]] (LRB) uses liquid fuel and oxidizer to give a liquid-propellant or hybrid rocket an extra boost at take-off, and/or increase the total payload that can be carried. It is attached to the side of a rocket. Unlike solid rocket boosters, LRBs can be throttled down if the engines are designed to allow it, and can be shut down safely in an emergency for additional escape options in human spaceflight.

==History==
By 1926, US scientist Robert Goddard had constructed and successfully tested the first rocket using liquid fuel at Auburn, Massachusetts.

For the Cold War era R-7 Semyorka missile, which later evolved into the Soyuz rocket, this concept was chosen because it allowed all of its many rocket engines to be ignited and checked for function while on the launch pad.

The Soviet Energia rocket of the 1980s used four Zenit liquid fueled boosters to loft both the &quot;Buran&quot; and the experimental &quot;Polyus&quot; space battlestation in two separate launches.

Two versions of the Japanese H-IIA space rocket would have used one or two LRBs to be able to carry extra cargo to higher geostationary orbits, but it was replaced by the H-IIB.

The Ariane 4 space launch vehicle could use two or four LRBs, the 42L, 44L, and 44LP configurations. As an example of the payload increase that boosters provide, the basic Ariane 40 model without boosters could launch around 2,175 kilograms into Geostationary transfer orbit, while the 44L configuration could launch 4,790 kg to the same orbit with four liquid boosters added.

Various LRBs were considered early in the Space Shuttle development program and after the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, but the Shuttle continued flying its Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster until retirement.

After the Space Shuttle retired, Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne and Dynetics entered the &quot;advanced booster competition&quot; for NASA&#x27;s next human rated vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS), with a booster design known as &quot;Pyrios&quot;, which would use two more advanced F-1B booster engines derived from the Rocketdyne F-1 LOX/RP-1 engine that powered the first stage of the Saturn V vehicle in the Apollo program. In 2012, it was determined that if the dual-engined Pyrios booster was selected for the SLS Block 2, the payload could be 150 metric tons (t) to Low Earth Orbit, 20 t more than the congressional minimum requirement of 130 t to LEO for SLS Block 2. In 2013, it was reported that in comparison to the F-1 engine, the F-1B engine was to have improved efficiency, be more cost effective and have fewer engine parts. Each F-1B was to produce of thrust at sea level, an increase over the of thrust of the initial F-1 engine.

Many Chinese launch vehicles have been using liquid boosters. These include China&#x27;s man-rated Long March 2F which uses four liquid rocket boosters each powered by a single YF-20B hypergolic rocket engine. The retired Long March 2E variant also used similar four liquid boosters. as did Long March 3B and Long March 3C variants. China developed semi-cryogenic boosters for the Long March 7 and Long March 5, its newest series of launch vehicles as of 2017 .

==Current usage==
The Delta IV Heavy consists of a central Common Booster Core (CBC), with two additional CBCs as LRBs instead of the GEM-60 solid rocket motors used by the Delta IV Medium+ versions. At lift off, all three cores operate at full thrust, and 44 seconds later the center core throttles down to 55% to conserve fuel until booster separation. The Angara A5V and Falcon Heavy are conceptually similar to Delta IV Heavy. The Indian GSLV also uses Four L40 boosters that are attached to the S139 stage.

The Falcon Heavy was originally designed with a unique &quot;propellant crossfeed&quot; capability, whereby the center core engines would be supplied with fuel and oxidizer from the two side cores until their separation. Operating all engines at full thrust from launch, with fuel supplied mainly from the side boosters, would deplete the side boosters sooner, allowing their earlier separation to reduce the mass being accelerated. This would leave most of the center core propellant available after booster separation. Musk stated in 2016 that crossfeed would not be implemented. Instead, the center booster throttles down shortly after liftoff to conserve fuel, and resumes full thrust after the side boosters have separated.

<doc id="1213730" wikidata="Q5183105" url="?curid=1213730" title="Crazy (Willie Nelson song)">
<text>&quot;Crazy&quot; is a song written by Willie Nelson and popularized by Patsy Cline in 1961. Nelson wrote the song while living in Houston, working for Pappy Daily&#x27;s label D Records. He was also a radio DJ and performed in clubs. Nelson then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, working as a writer for Pamper Music. Through Hank Cochran, the song reached Patsy Cline. After her original recording and release, Cline&#x27;s version reached number two on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Singles, also crossing to the pop chart as a top 10 single.

Cline&#x27;s version is considered a country music standard and, in 1996, became the all-time most played song in jukeboxes in the United States. &quot;Crazy&quot; was covered by many artists; different versions reached the charts in a variety of genres. The song was featured in television shows, while many publications have included it in their all-time best songs lists. The Library of Congress inducted Cline&#x27;s version into the National Recording Registry in 2003.

==Background and writing==
In 1958, while performing around Fort Worth, Texas, and working as a DJ hosting &quot;The Western Express&quot;, Willie Nelson attracted the attention of Pappy Daily. Daily, a record producer from Houston, offered Nelson a recording contract with D Records as well as a job as a writer for Glad Music. Nelson moved to Houston, where he also searched for musical gigs in ballrooms and clubs. At the Esquire Ballroom, band leader Larry Butler told Nelson that he could not offer a musician job. In response, Nelson suggested he sell original songs that he played for Butler on a reel-to-reel tape recorder. Butler liked the songs, but refused to buy, instead offering Nelson a job working six nights a week with his band. Nelson and his family settled in Pasadena, Texas, where he became a DJ on radio station KRCT. Later, he also taught guitar.
Nelson used his commute from Pasadena to the Esquire Ballroom as writing time, because the ride usually took an hour that he used to develop new lyrics. Over one week, he wrote &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Night Life&quot;, and &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;. At the time, Nelson&#x27;s mood was negatively affected by his lack of stable employment while supporting his wife and three children, since his three jobs did not provide enough income. On his long night commutes to clubs, he compared his situation with those of his contemporaries and felt that &quot;the world was asleep&quot;. According to his autobiography &quot;It&#x27;s A Long Story: My Life&quot;, Nelson wondered if he was &quot;Crazy&quot; and completed the song as if he were a man whose relationship recently ended. Musician Sleepy LaBeef, who accompanied Nelson on upright bass on the song&#x27;s demo recording, asserted that the songwriter had arrived in Houston with &quot;Crazy&quot; already written. Additionally, biographer Joe Nick Patoski noted that Nelson played &quot;Crazy&quot; for Butler along with the songs he planned to sell just as he arrived in the city. Nelson wrote &quot;Crazy&quot; in less than an hour, and originally titled it &quot;Stupid&quot;. The intonation of the opening was inspired by Floyd Tillman&#x27;s &quot;I Gotta Have My Baby Back&quot;.

Nelson sold an original song, &quot;Family Bible&quot;, which was then recorded by Claude Gray, whose version enjoyed success. But Nelson&#x27;s employment situation remained unstable. He accumulated debt, while he often attended parties and drank to excess. In July 1960, Nelson was arrested for speeding and driving without a license. After several tardy incidents, he was fired by KRCT, then let go from a Pasadena club where he performed. Nelson then decided to move his wife and children to Waco, Texas, and, after the success of &quot;Family Bible&quot;, moved to Nashville, Tennessee .

At first Nelson lived with Billy Walker, who found him an encyclopedia sales job. Walker also took him to different music publishers in town, and introduced Nelson as the writer of &quot;Family Bible&quot; to the artists and songwriters that frequented Tootsie&#x27;s Orchid Lounge. Through steel guitarist Buddy Emmons, Nelson became acquainted with many &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; performers. The publishing house Pamper Music hired him after Faron Young&#x27;s recording of &quot;Hello Walls&quot; and Billy Walker&#x27;s of &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot; succeeded.

==Patsy Cline&#x27;s recording==

In his book &quot;Willie: An Autobiography&quot;, Nelson recalled that it was hard to find artists interested in recording &quot;Crazy&quot; due to its use of several chords, instead of the standard three used for country music compositions at the time. Walker intended to record the song, and made a demo at Starday Records. Ultimately, the label decided to reject Walker&#x27;s proposition since they felt that &quot;Crazy&quot; would not have commercial success.

Nelson&#x27;s fellow Pamper Music song plugger and writer Hank Cochran played &quot;Crazy&quot; for Patsy Cline&#x27;s producer Owen Bradley, who felt that the composition would be good for Cline. Cochran then told Walker about Bradley&#x27;s interest in the song for Cline and asked him not to record it. In exchange, Cochran gave Walker &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Shoes&quot;.

Cline&#x27;s husband Charlie Dick had previously taken her a demo of Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Night Life&quot;. Cline disliked the song, and she asked her husband not to bring her any more of Nelson&#x27;s songs, saying that she did not want to record compositions that embraced vulnerability or loss of love. The persistent Cochran drove Nelson to Cline&#x27;s house with the demo of &quot;Crazy&quot;. While Nelson waited in the car, Cochran played the song for Cline. Cline told Cochran to bring Nelson into the house, where he taught her to sing the song. Cline had difficulty following Nelson&#x27;s phrasing because he sang behind the beat. An alternative account published by Nelson in his 2015 book &quot;It&#x27;s A Long Story: My Life&quot; revealed that, while drinking with Dick at Tootsie&#x27;s Orchid Lounge, Nelson played his demo of &quot;Crazy&quot; on the bar&#x27;s jukebox. Dick thought the song was good, that his wife should record it, and offered to take Nelson to his home to play the demo for Cline. Because it was after midnight, Nelson decided to wait in the car as Dick played the song for Cline, and she later invited him in.
Bradley planned to record &quot;Crazy&quot; with the minor and major sevenths jazz chords favored by Nelson. For most of the song, the composition uses a B-flat key but ends in B major. Bradley decided to add the Jordanaires on background vocals, pianist Floyd Cramer, and bass guitarist Bob Moore. Cramer opened with a four-bar introduction, followed by brushing from drummer Buddy Harman. Moore was complemented by Harold Bradley&#x27;s electric guitar, creating a tic-tac effect. The first four-hour recording session took place on August 21, 1961, at Bradley&#x27;s Quonset hut Studio B. Cline had recently been in a car accident that bruised her ribs and Owen Bradley had to end her participation because, in her pain, she could not reach the notes needed to match Nelson&#x27;s phrasing. Bradley worked the arrangements with the musicians and recorded the music track for the song.

Bradley asked Cline to use her own rather than Nelson&#x27;s singing style. After her ribs recovered three weeks later, Cline returned to record her vocal track; she accomplished it on the first take. During the session on September 15, 1961, Cline&#x27;s vocal featured ascending and descending intervals and the use of broken chords. Cline learned to sing in the style needed for &quot;Crazy&quot; early in her life; she listened to and imitated big band and jazz performers that she heard on the radio. Following Nelson, Cline sang slightly behind the beat, but modified to fit her own unique style.

===Release and reception===

&quot;Crazy&quot; was released in October 1961 by Decca Records under catalog number 31317 with &quot;Who Can I Count On&quot; on the flip side. In November, &quot;Crazy&quot; was included on Cline&#x27;s album &quot;Showcase&quot;. After 11 weeks, the single peaked at number two on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Singles and it crossed over to the pop charts reaching number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, also attaining number two on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Easy Listening chart. It was Cline&#x27;s only top 10 hit on the Hot 100. With the success of &quot;Crazy&quot; and her previous single &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot;, Cline was named &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Favorite Female Country Artist of 1961. In November 1961, Cline sang &quot;Crazy&quot; during a performance with the Grand Ole Opry cast at Carnegie Hall.

&quot;Crazy&quot; became Cline&#x27;s most successful pop single, her signature song, and one of the country songs that generated the most royalties. Nelson dubbed Cline&#x27;s his favorite version of his composition. He opined that her interpretation was done with &quot;delicacy, soul, and perfect diction&quot;. Media outlets, including National Public Radio, &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, and &quot;American Songwriter&quot; defined &quot;Crazy&quot; as a country music standard.

The recording was featured in the 1985 Cline biopic &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. In 1989, the Amusement and Music Operators Association ranked &quot;Crazy&quot; number two on the all-time Top 40 Jukebox Singles on the United States list. By 1996, the updated list cited the song as the most played in jukeboxes. &quot;Crazy&quot; appeared on the UK Singles Chart in 1987 at number 79, and moved to number 14 in 1990. The next year, it peaked at number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart. In 2003, Cline&#x27;s recording was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress. The next year, it was ranked number 85 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In the 2021 version of the list, the magazine placed it at number 195. In 2018, it was included by &quot;New Musical Express&quot; on their &quot;25 best country songs of all time&quot; list, in 2019; &quot;The Tennessean&quot; listed it as one of the 100 best country songs of all time.

In 1992, Patsy&#x27;s version of &quot;Crazy&quot; was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2024, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song at number three on its 200 Greatest Country Songs of All Time ranking.

&quot;Crazy&quot; was twice featured in the TV series &quot;Nashville&quot;: sung by Juliette Barnes in the 2014 episode &quot;That&#x27;s Me Without You&quot;, and by Barnes and Steven Tyler in a duet on the 2015 episode &quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot;. Nelson recorded duets of the song with Mary Sarah (2014) and then with Carla Bruni (2017). In 2022, Heather Small performed a version of &quot;Crazy&quot; in series 3 of the British version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

&quot;Crazy&quot; was recorded by Lester Bowie &amp; Brass Fantasy on his album &quot;Avant Pop&quot; in 1986 as a jazz interpretation.

In 2014, Neil Young released a &quot;retro-tech&quot; version on his album &quot;A Letter Home&quot;, co-produced by Jack White and recorded in a refurbished 1947 Voice-o-Graph vinyl recording booth.

<text>Rear Admiral Robert Witcher Copeland (September 9, 1910 – August 25, 1973) was a United States Navy officer who served during World War II.

Copeland was born in Tacoma, Washington. Enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1929, he was commissioned as a Naval Reserve officer in 1935. Copeland practiced law from 1935 until 1940, when he was ordered to active duty during the Navy&#x27;s pre-World War II expansion. During the war, he commanded , , , and .

During the Battle off Samar, October 25, 1944, while commanding &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, Lieutenant Commander Copeland led his ship and crew in an attack on a superior Japanese battleship and cruiser force. Though his ship was lost, this action helped defeat the Japanese counter-offensive against the Leyte invasion. For this, he was awarded the Navy Cross, and shared the Presidential Unit Citation with the rest of Task Unit 77.4.3.

According to the action report of the USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts,&quot; &quot;The crew were informed over the loud speaker system at the beginning of the action, of the Commanding Officer&#x27;s estimate of the situation, that is, a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival could not be expected, during which time we would do what damage we could. In the face of this knowledge the men zealously manned their stations wherever they might be, and fought and worked with such calmness, courage and efficiency that no higher honor could be conceived than to command such a group of men.&quot;

Following World War II, Copeland resumed his law career while remaining a member of the Naval Reserve, in which he rose to the rank of Rear Admiral. Robert W. Copeland died at Tacoma, Washington, on August 25, 1973.

In 1980, the frigate was named for him.

===Navy Cross citation===

:Lieutenant Commander Robert Witcher Copeland
:U.S. Navy
:Date Of Action: October 25, 1944
:The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Lieutenant Commander Robert Witcher Copeland, United States Naval Reserve, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of the Destroyer Escort U.S.S. SAMUEL B. ROBERTS (DE-413), in a surface action with a large task force of the Japanese Fleet off the Island of Samar, in Philippine waters, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 25 October 1944. Against an enemy force vastly superior in numbers, armament and armor, with cool deliberation Lieutenant Commander Copeland closed to within 4,000 yards of a heavy cruiser to deliver a torpedo attack on the rapidly advancing enemy who had taken him under fire from their large caliber guns. By his heroic action, he thus diverted enemy fire to himself from the almost defenseless vessels which he was protecting. Although his ship was lost in this engagement, his heroic actions were instrumental in turning back, sorely crippled, a vastly superior enemy force. His extraordinary courage and magnificent fighting spirit in the face of terrific odds will live forever in the memory of the officers and men who served with him that day. His conduct was in keeping with the highest traditions of the Navy of the United States.

<text>&quot;Do the Reggay&quot; is a reggae song by the Maytals, written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverley&#x27;s in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. It was the first popular song to use the word &quot;reggae&quot; and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, &quot;reggay&quot; had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song&#x27;s connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.

Hibbert claimed in a BBC Radio 6 Music interview that he took the word from a slang term for a person who is a bit scruffy or not well-kempt.

<text>François Vatel (; 1631 – 24 April 1671) was the majordomo (in French, ) of Nicolas Fouquet and prince Louis, Grand Condé.

==Biography==
Vatel was born either in Switzerland or in Paris in 1625, 1631, or 1635. He is widely, but incorrectly, credited with creating &quot;crème Chantilly&quot; (Chantilly cream), a sweet, vanilla-flavored whipped cream.

Vatel served Louis XIV&#x27;s superintendent Nicolas Fouquet in the inauguration at the Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte that took place on 17 August 1661.

Vatel was responsible for an extravagant banquet for 2,000 people hosted in honour of Louis XIV by the Grand Condé in April 1671 at the Château de Chantilly, where he died. According to a letter by Madame de Sévigné, Vatel was so distraught about the lateness of the seafood delivery and about other mishaps that he died by suicide by running himself through with his sword, and his body was discovered when someone came to tell him of the arrival of the fish. 

This incident is thought to be the origin of the idiom &quot;died for want of lobster sauce&quot;, a phrase meaning to die or be devastated due to a minor disappointment or mishap.

==In popular culture==
Vatel was depicted in an eponymous 2000 film directed by Roland Joffé, in which he was portrayed by Gérard Depardieu. The film depicts Vatel committing suicide after realizing he was nothing more than property in the eyes of the nobility and Louis XIV&#x27;s court creates the account of his dissatisfaction with the banquet causing his suicide to conceal the true nature of his death from the king.

<doc id="1213749" wikidata="Q3758550" url="?curid=1213749" title="Shoal bass">
<text>The shoal bass (Micropterus cataractae) is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of order Centrarchiformes. One of the black basses, it is native to waters in Florida and Georgia. It is also occasionally found in rivers and streams of East Alabama where it has been declared an endangered species and cannot legally be kept if caught by fishermen. Of typical size for a black bass, &quot;M. cataractae&quot; reaches a maximum recorded length of and a maximum published weight of 8 pounds, 12 ounces.

Only described for the first time in 1999, ichthyologists are still expanding what is known about the species. The shoal bass is often confused with the redeye bass, due to its red-tinted eyes. It is also often confused with the smallmouth bass, due to its faint vertical stripes along the side of its body.

==Description==
This species was formerly considered either a redeye bass or subspecies of the redeye bass. In 1999 it was described as a new species.

The red color of eyes associates this species with the redeye and Suwannee bass at first glance. However, it is more closely related morphologically to the spotted bass. Shoal bass are generally olive green to nearly black along the back. A dusky dark blotch about 50 to 67 percent of the size of the eye occurs on the back edge of the gill cover. Three diagonal black lines radiate along the side of the head looking like war paint. Ten to fifteen vertical blotches appear along the sides with tiger-stripes often appearing in between.

The belly is creamy or white and wavy lines may appear slightly above the white belly on the sides. The dorsal, caudal and anal fins are dark olive green to grayish black. Pelvic fins may have a cream colored leading edge with dark spots.

The shoal bass has scales on the base portion of the soft-rayed dorsal fins, clearly connected first and second dorsal fins, and an upper jaw bone that does not extend beyond the eyes.

There are no known subspecies of the shoal bass.

==Range and habitat==
The shoal bass is becoming increasingly uncommon in the Apalachicola and Chipola rivers because so few shoals exist and competition with non-native spotted bass has increased. It is also known in the Chattahoochee river drainage; and is most plentiful in the relatively undammed Flint River of Georgia, as well as lakes such as Blackshear and West Point. Shoal bass are closely associated with rock shoals and are uncommon in other habitat due to their unique spawning requirements.

The conservation status of shoal bass is vulnerable throughout its range. Good fishing still exists in Georgia&#x27;s Flint River, but anglers are encouraged to catch and release. Conversely, anglers are urged to keep all spotted bass caught on the Flint River because of its competition with and potential for hybridizing with the shoal bass.

==Behavior==
Shoal bass spawn in coarse gravel at the heads of creek pools in April and May, to early June. They prefer a spawning temperature of . Like the largemouth, the male prepares the nest and guards the eggs and fry.

Shoal bass feed mainly on aquatic insects on the surface. They also feed on larval insects, crayfish and fish. Shoal bass grow much faster than redeye bass.

==Sporting quality==

Shoal bass offer similar sporting quality to that of other species of black bass. They can be caught using worms, minnows, or crayfish as well as small spinners and a wide variety of small surface lures. Some have been known to reach more than eight pounds. As a sport fish, specific bag and size limit regulations apply, and you can register a qualifying catch as part of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission&#x27;s &quot;Big Catch&quot; program.

The shoal bass has white, flaky meat, which tends to be drier than that of a largemouth or spotted bass.

The world record shoal bass was 8 pounds, 12 ounces according to the International Game Fish Association. The fish was caught October 23, 1977, in the Apalachicola River, Florida. This bass was a shoal bass, but originally reported as the Apalachicola form of redeye bass.

Shoal bass are also popular targets for fly fishers, who find them easy to access in their preferred river environments. The practice of fly fishing for shoal bass is becoming more widespread.

The shoal bass fights harder than its cousin, the largemouth bass, and has more stamina. They prefer moderate to heavy current and will take crawdad patterns aggressively. Five pound shoal bass are considered trophies, but fish above seven pounds are caught each year.

<text>Tripod are an Australian musical comedy trio founded by Scod (Scott Edgar), Yon (Simon Hall) and Gatesy (Steven Gates) in 1996. They provide original songs and harmonies, strung together by comic banter.

== History ==

===Live shows===
Tripod began as buskers in Melbourne malls, performing a far-fetched prop act of which no record exists. They emerged as a musical act from the thriving Melbourne live music pub scene of the mid nineties, supporting popular local cover bands in such places as the Station Hotel, The Esplanade, the Central Club, the New Orleans Tavern and the Ritz, St Kilda. They were very much a cover band at first, performing three part harmony versions on hits by the likes of Elvis Costello, Bowie, the Beach Boys and Queen. They garnered a local following via regular residencies at the Commercial Hotel, Yarraville, just after it stopped being a biker bar.

They soon became regulars at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, a Melbourne comedy venue, where they honed their skills in residencies and appearances from 1998 through to its demise in 2003.

Tripod are stalwarts of their home festival, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, where they often performed since 1997, when they took their pub act and jammed it into a one-hour festival format at St Martins Youth Arts Centre, in a show entitled &quot;Welcome to My Wonderwall&quot;. They have appeared on music festival stages including the Falls Festival, the Port Fairy Folk Festival, the Queenscliff Music Festival and the Woodford Folk Festival.

Tripod have appeared internationally, including the Montreal Just For Laughs festival and the Upright Citizens Brigade theatre in New York and Los Angeles. They have played the Edinburgh Fringe numerous times.

They have also toured the Australian rural countryside including long stints with the MICF Roadshow.

Tripod alternate the form of their shows between the song-and-sketch cabaret gig format (such as &quot;Self Saucing&quot; and &quot;Men of Substance&quot;) and narrative musicals. Their first &quot;story&quot; show was &quot;Tripod Tells the Tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (not very well)&quot;, which premiered at the MICF before touring nationally.

Their narrative show, &quot;Lady Robots&quot;, was first previewed at the 2002 Adelaide Fringe Festival before it was performed at the MICF later that year. The show was a musical comedy telling the story of three men who are hurled into space where they come across a planet populated only by Lady Robots. Tripod performed a re-jigged version of the show, &quot;Lady Robots v1.1&quot; at the Athenaeum Theatre at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2005, before a national tour culminating in a hit season at the Sydney Opera House. No recordings are known to exist.

On 30 January 2010, Tripod held the world premiere of their comedic musical &quot;Tripod versus the Dragon&quot; at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Massachusetts, United States. Elana Stone co-starred in the production in the role of &quot;The Dungeon Master&quot;/&quot;Dragon&quot; after Megan Washington, who had been co-writing songs for the production, declined the role due to scheduling conflicts. The production is based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. Tripod went on to perform this show at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the Sydney Opera House, and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2010, as well as subsequent seasons in Perth, Brisbane, regional Victoria and the Przeglad Piosenki Aktorskiej festival in Wroclaw, Poland.

In January 2013, Tripod joined forces with Australian performer Eddie Perfect to create &quot;Perfect Tripod&quot;, a show of classic Australian songs arranged in four-part harmony, inspired by their cover of &quot;Meet Me in the Middle of the Air&quot; performed on &quot;The Sideshow&quot; on 13 October 2007. Perfect Tripod toured concert halls throughout the nation and have collaborated with such Australian pop music greats as Gotye and Missy Higgins.

In October 2014, Tripod performed live at the international gaming convention, PAX (Penny Arcade Expo), in Melbourne at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. There they performed a short preview of &quot;This Gaming Life&quot;, an original collaboration between Tripod, Grammy nominated composer Austin Wintory and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.

In 2015 &quot;This Gaming Life&quot; played to rapturous houses at Hamer Hall, Victorian Arts Centre, with a 55 piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Wintory. The show was a full scale two-act orchestral love letter to the culture and relationships of passionate video gamers, and has been described as the &quot;Stand By Me of the gamer generation.&quot;

===TV===
The band got their first break appearing on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Red Faces&quot; contest, where they performed a parodic medley of Oasis hits that demonstrated similarities between the songs.

Their first regular TV appearances were on &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; (IMT) with Frankie J Holden. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s they also showed up regularly on such live TV stalwarts as &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; with Bert Newton, &quot;Denise with Denise Drysdale&quot; and popular Saturday morning live rock show &quot;Recovery&quot;.

Tripod were a feature act in Network Ten&#x27;s 2003/2004 sketch comedy television show &quot;skitHOUSE&quot;, writing and performing sketches and songs as part of the core cast.

They performed on &quot;Rove/Rove Live&quot; in 1999, 2003, and 2004, and were guest programmers of &quot;Rage&quot; in 2004.

Tripod were also core cast performers on the 2007 ABC weekly variety program &quot;The Sideshow.&quot;

The group made frequent musical appearances on Network Ten&#x27;s &quot;Good News Week&quot; from 2009 to 2011, and have appeared on various ABC1 programs, including &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; (May 2011), and &quot;Adam Hills Tonight&quot; (May 2013).

They have appeared yearly for almost two decades on the Oxfam Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala.

===Radio===
Tripod have appeared as guests throughout their career on popular Australian radio stations.

Their &quot;Song-in-an-Hour Challenge (2001–2004)&quot; was a popular segment on Triple J&#x27;s drive-time show with Merrick and Rosso, and later on the Triple J &quot;Breakfast&quot; show with Wil Anderson and Adam Spencer. In it they had one hour to write and arrange a coherent song based on incoherent listener suggestions and then perform said song to an eager national audience. Tripod often refer to this experience as their songwriting boot camp.

Two CDs containing some of the finest examples of these sessions have been released, each also including recordings taken from live &quot;Song-In-An-Hour&quot; challenges featured in Tripod&#x27;s &quot;Pod August Nights&quot; concerts. In late 2005, they moved to Fox FM where they could be heard on Peter Helliar&#x27;s weekly Friday morning show, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Show&quot;.

=== Podcast ===
On 24 December 2015 Tripod along with host Andrew Pogson started a regular podcast titled Perfectly Good Podcast. Initially started to promote their upcoming 101 Tripod Hits tour, the ongoing series shifted its focus covering any number of topic including current themes or stories from Tripod&#x27;s 20+ years together. Each podcast centres around a theme in which host Andrew Pogson attempts to keep the members of Tripod to. Tripod also play live or play recordings of their songs which loosely relate to the episode&#x27;s theme.
Suggested in Episode 27, and making its first appearance in Episode 28 with Andrew Pogson&#x27;s submission Tripod asked listeners to submit alternate lyrics for the song Aquaman, and Tripod then played each submission on varies episodes.
=== Game Music ===
In 2023, Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical was released, featuring songs co-written by Tripod. The album is nominated for a Grammy Award for the 2024 ceremony.

== Recordings ==
Tripod&#x27;s very first record &quot;Box Set&quot; was released in 1997. It was funded by their winnings from live TV segment &quot;Red Faces&quot; on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;

Their album &quot;Middleborough Rd&quot;, made up of studio recordings of songs they wrote for the sketch TV series &quot;SkitHouse,&quot; won the ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005.

Tripod toured with the show &quot;Tripod are Self Saucing&quot; in 2004, and again at the 2006 MICF. They recorded a live album of the show in April 2006 entitled &quot;Songs from Self Saucing&quot;, recorded and mixed by regular collaborator Nao Anzai, which was nominated for Best Comedy Release at the 2007 ARIA awards.

Tripod&#x27;s first DVD was also released in 2006: a live recording of their 2005 show &quot;POD August Nights&quot;. The DVD includes numerous special features including a music video for their song &quot;Gonna Make You Happy Tonight&quot; from their 2004 album, &quot;Middleborough Rd&quot;.

Tripod&#x27;s 2001 show, &quot;Tripod tells the tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (Not Very Well)&quot; was also released on DVD in 2006, following the original 2001 VHS release.

In 2009, Tripod released a DVD of a live performance at the Woodford Folk Festival. This DVD featured never-before-seen bonus footage consisting of a bootleg recording of their 2007 show &quot;How to Train an Attack Dog from Scratch&quot;, a show whose narrative was loosely based around an examination of the fictional history of musical comedy.

Tripod released a Christmas album in 2009, from their Christmas shows, entitled &quot;For the Love of God&quot;. A toured nationally with the songs, performing in the Sydney Opera House that year.

They released a CD of songs from &quot;Tripod versus the Dragon&quot;, including extended versions of the songs from an early version of the show, as well as a DVD with numerous easter eggs and special features on 2 March 2011.

&quot;Men of Substance&quot;, their first full scale studio project since &quot;For the Love of God&quot;, was produced by longtime friend and collaborator John Castle (Megan Washington, Vance Joy, the Bamboos)

<text>Teatro Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (commonly referred as &quot;Teatro Tapia&quot;), is the oldest free-standing drama stage building located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is named after Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (1826–1882), a Puerto Rican poet and dramatist.

==Location==
The theater faces east, across from Plaza de Colón, on Fortaleza Street, and was constructed in 1824. It was designed in the Italian style as a horseshoe shaped opera house with three tiers of boxes. A block south lies a brick-shaped former &quot;Casa de camineros&quot;, house of road-maintainers. To the north-east lies a string of cultural institutions: the restored &quot;Casino de Puerto Rico&quot;, the YMCA, the Carnegie library, the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, and Moorish-inspired Casa de España. In the northern seaward cliff sprawls the historic and labyrinthine fort of San Cristóbal. The original landward gate of old San Juan lays just east of this site on Calle Fortaleza.

==Significance==
For over one hundred years since it was built it was the center of cultural life in the city. Famous soprano Adelina Patti sang there in one of her earlier tours of the Americas during the mid-nineteenth century. Other notable performers to have graced its stage include the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova.

Emilio Pasarell and Antonia Saez have said that &quot;the most significant moments of Puerto Rico&#x27;s musical history are associated with...Teatro Tapia.&quot;
==History==
Initially named the San Juan Municipal Theater, it was renamed the &quot;Antonio Paoli Theater&quot; in 1935. It was subsequently officially renamed the &quot;Teatro Alejandro Tapia y Rivera&quot; in 1937. 

After years of neglect during the 1940s, the theater was saved from demolition by the former long-time Mayor of San Juan Felisa Rincón de Gautier. It was restored in the late 1940s and has subsequently been used to provide a venue for musical theater, drama and other cultural events. With a maximum capacity of 647 people, this 19th-century theater serves as an arena for cultural events and enchanting ballet performances. The interior audience hall is remarkable for the period. Subsequent restorations (in 1976 and 1997) returned it to its old charm.

<text>The Codex Mendoza is an Aztec codex, believed to have been created around the year 1541. It contains a history of both the Aztec rulers and their conquests as well as a description of the daily life of pre-conquest Aztec society. The codex is written using traditional Aztec pictograms with a translation and explanation of the text provided in Spanish. It is named after Don Antonio de Mendoza (1495-1552), the viceroy of New Spain, who supervised its creation and who was a leading patron of native artists. 

Mendoza knew that the ravages of the conquest had destroyed multiple native artifacts, and that the craft traditions that generated them had been effaced. When the Spanish crown ordered Mendoza to provide evidence of the Aztec political and tribute system, he invited skilled artists and scribes who were being schooled at the Franciscan college in Tlatelolco to gather in a workshop under the supervision of Spanish priests where they could recreate the document for him and the King of Spain. The pictorial document that they produced became known as the Codex Mendoza: it consists of seventy-one folios made of Spanish paper measuring 20.6 × 30.6 centimeters (8.25 × 12.25 inches). The document is crafted in the native style, but it now is bound at a spine in the manner of European books.

The codex is also known as the Codex Mendocino and La colección Mendoza, and has been held at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University since 1659. It was on display as part of the Bodleian&#x27;s &quot;Gifts and Books&quot; exhibition from 16 June to 29 October 2023. The Bodleian Library holds four other Mesoamerican codices: Codex Bodley, Codex Laud, Codex Selden, and the Selden Roll.

== History ==

The manuscript must date from after 6 July 1529, since Hernán Cortéz is referred to on folio 15r as &#x27;marques del Valle&#x27;. It must have been produced before 1553, when it was in the possession of the French cosmographer André Thevet, who wrote his name on folios 1r, 2r, 70v, 71v.

The final page of the manuscript explains some of the circumstances in which it was produced. 

The manuscript was therefore finished in haste and designed to be sent to Spain. More precise information regarding the exact date of the manuscript and the reasons it was produced is controversial. The testimony of the conquistador Jerónimo López, probably dating from 1547, may be relevant.

Silvio Zavala argued that the book referred to was the Codex Mendoza, and his arguments were restated by Federico Gómez de Orozco. If this is the case, then the Codex was written (&#x27;six years ago more or less&#x27; from López&#x27;s recollection) and was commissioned by Mendoza. As H. B. Nicolson has pointed out, however, the description is not an exact fit for the Codex, and the identification is not certain.

According to a later account by Samuel Purchas, a later owner of the Codex, writing in 1625, the Spanish fleet was attacked by French privateers and all of the booty, including the codex, was taken to France.

It was certainly in the possession of André Thévet, cosmographer to King Henry II of France. Thévet wrote his name in five places on the codex, twice with the date 1553. It was later owned by the Englishman Richard Hakluyt. According again to Samuel Purchas, Hakluyt bought the Codex for 20 French francs. Some time after 1616 it was passed to Samuel Purchas, then to his son, and then to John Selden. The codex was deposited into the Bodleian Library at Oxford University in 1659, five years after Selden&#x27;s death, where it remained in obscurity until 1831, when it was rediscovered by Viscount Kingsborough and brought to the attention of scholars.

== Content ==

Written on European paper, it contains 71 pages, divided into three sections:
*Section I, folios 1r to 17r or 18r, is a history of the Aztec people from 1325 through 1521 — from the founding of Tenochtitlan through the Spanish conquest. It lists the reign of each ruler and the towns conquered by them. It is uncertain whether folios 17v and 18r belong to Section I or Section II.
*Section II, folios 17v or 18v to 54v, provides a list of the towns conquered by the Triple Alliance and the tributes paid by each. This section is closely related to, and probably copied from, the Matrícula de Tributos, but the Codex Mendoza contains five provinces not included in the Matrícula. This probably represents material now missing from the Matrícula, but present when the Codex Mendoza was copied.
*Section III, folios 56v to 71v, is a pictorial depiction of the daily life of the Aztecs.

Folios 73 to 85 of MS. Arch. Selden. A. 1, as currently foliated, do not form part of the Codex Mendoza. These folios comprise an originally separate manuscript, apparently written in England in the first half of the seventeenth century. This manuscript contains tables of the comparative value of Roman, Greek, English, and French money. The two manuscripts were bound together in England in the early seventeenth century.

<text>Chondrosarcoma is a bone sarcoma, a primary cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage. A chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas. About 30% of bone sarcomas are chondrosarcomas. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone sarcomas that mainly affect children and adolescents, a chondrosarcoma can present at any age. It more often affects the axial skeleton than the appendicular skeleton.

==Types==
==Symptoms and signs==
* Back or thigh pain
* Sciatica
* Bladder Symptoms
* Unilateral edema

==Causes==
The cause is unknown. There may be a history of enchondroma or osteochondroma. A small minority of secondary chondrosarcomas occur in people with Maffucci syndrome and Ollier disease.

It has been associated with faulty isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 enzymes, which are also associated with gliomas and leukemias.

==Diagnosis==

Imaging studies – including radiographs (&quot;x-rays&quot;), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – are often used to make a presumptive diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. However, a definitive diagnosis depends on the identification of malignant cancer cells producing cartilage in a biopsy specimen that has been examined by a pathologist. In a few cases, usually of highly anaplastic tumors, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required.

There are no blood tests currently available to enable an oncologist to render a diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. The most characteristic imaging findings are usually obtained with CT.

Nearly all chondrosarcoma patients appear to be in good health. Often, patients are not aware of the growing tumor until there is a noticeable lump or pain. Earlier diagnosis is generally accidental when a patient undergoes testing for another problem and physicians discover cancer. Occasionally the first symptom will be a broken bone at the cancerous site. Any broken bone that occurs from mild trauma warrants further investigation, although there are many conditions that can lead to weak bones, and this form of cancer is not a common cause of such breaks.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the location of the disease and the aggressiveness of the tumors. 

Surgery is the main form of treatment for chondrosarcoma. Musculoskeletal tumor specialists or orthopedic oncologists are usually chosen to treat chondrosarcoma, unless it is located in the skull, spine, or chest cavity, in which case, a neurosurgeon or thoracic surgeon experienced with sarcomas is chosen. Often, a limb-sparing operation can be performed, but in some cases amputation is unavoidable. Amputation of the arm, leg, jaw, or half of the pelvis (called a hemipelvectomy) may be necessary in some cases.

There are two kinds of hemipelvectomy – internal and external.
* External hemipelvectomy – is removal of that half of the pelvis with the amputation of the leg. It is also called hindquarter amputation.
* Internal hemipelvectomy – is removal of that half of the pelvis, but the leg is left intact.

Amputation at the hip is called hip disarticulation and amputees who have had this amputation are also called hip disartics.

Chemotherapy or traditional radiotherapy are not very effective for most chondrosarcomas, although proton therapy is showing promise with local tumor control at over 80%.

Complete surgical ablation is the most effective treatment, but sometimes this is difficult. Proton therapy radiation can be useful in awkward locations to make surgery more effective.

Recent studies have shown that induction of apoptosis in high-grade chondrosarcoma, both directly and by enhancement of response to chemotherapy and radiation, is a valid therapeutic strategy.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends on how early the cancer is discovered and treated. For the least aggressive grade, about 90% of patients survive more than five years after diagnosis. People usually have a good survival rate at the low-grade volume of cancer. For the most aggressive grade, only 10% of patients will survive one year. Tumors may recur in the future. Follow up scans are extremely important for chondrosarcoma to make sure there has been no recurrence or metastasis, which usually occurs in the lungs.

<text>David Samuel Goyer (born December 22, 1965) is an American filmmaker, novelist, and comic book writer. He is best known for writing the screenplays and stories for several superhero films, including &quot;Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (1998), the &quot;Blade&quot; trilogy (1998–2004), Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy (2005–2012), &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), and &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016). He has also directed four films: &quot;Zig Zag&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;The Invisible&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Unborn&quot; (2009). He is the creator of the science fiction television series &quot;Foundation&quot; which is loosely based upon the &quot;Foundation&quot; series written by Isaac Asimov.

Goyer was co-writer of the video games &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;, and &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&quot;. He won a Saturn Award for Best Writing for &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) and received another nomination for &quot;Dark City&quot;, and has been nominated for four Hugo Awards.

==Early life==
Goyer and his brother Jeff were born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and were raised by their mother. He is Jewish on his mother&#x27;s side, and attended Hebrew school. Goyer is an alumnus of Huron High School and the University of Southern California, graduating from the School of Cinema-Television in 1988.

Goyer was a student of screenwriter Nelson Gidding at USC and frequently returned to Gidding&#x27;s class as a guest speaker. He graduated in 1988 and sold his first screenplay for &quot;Death Warrant&quot; in 1989, which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme. With his first paycheck, he bought an Isuzu Trooper, which was stolen the first night he drove it home.

==Career==
A professed comic book fanatic who often wrote to letter columns, Goyer has written or co-written several screenplays based on comic book characters and series, including &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, and &quot;Blade&quot;. and had written a script treatment for a film adaptation of &quot;Venom&quot;, which was rejected. Goyer wrote a title based around the Justice Society of America for DC Comics titled &quot;JSA&quot;, which debuted in August 1999. For the first five issues, he collaborated with James Robinson and, until his departure following issue 51, with Geoff Johns, who would take over as solo writer. Alongside Brannon Braga, Goyer co-created &quot;FlashForward&quot;, a science-fiction TV series that premiered on ABC in 2009. The series was based on the novel by Robert J. Sawyer. He stepped in as show runner in October 2009 after the series struggled out of the gate. On February 5, 2010, Goyer announced he would be stepping down as &quot;FlashForward&quot; showrunner to focus on feature films and directing.

Goyer&#x27;s comicbook films explore the consequences of becoming a symbolic figure, a topic he has long been interested in. In 2011, Goyer wrote a short story titled &quot;The Incident&quot; in which Superman renounces his United States citizenship. Goyer worked with Legendary Pictures on three of their projects. He co-wrote the scripts for &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012) and &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013). In addition, he did a one-step 4-week rewrite for Legendary Pictures&#x27; &quot;Godzilla&quot; reboot. During the same year, Goyer published his first novel, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, the first in a trilogy co-written by Michael Cassutt for Ace/Penguin. The novel received generally positive reviews. Goyer subsequently sold the film rights to Warner Bros. and is adapting the first novel for the big screen.

In late October 2011, cable channel Starz and BBC Worldwide greenlit his TV project, &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Demons&quot;, which followed the life of a 25-year-old Leonardo da Vinci. &quot;This will be a show about secret histories, genius, madness and all things profane,&quot; according to Goyer. The show ran for three seasons and received generally favorable reviews, including an 81% rating from Rotten Tomatoes. In March 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that Goyer would be directing a film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by Alexandre Dumas.

In June 2013, he was announced to work on both &quot;Justice League&quot; and a sequel to &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. In September 2013, Goyer delivered a screenwriting lecture as part of the BAFTA and BFI Screenwriters&#x27; Lecture Series. Goyer produced the horror film &quot;The Forest&quot;, directed by Jason Zada. Focus Features has the North American distribution rights to the film, which was Zada&#x27;s feature film directorial debut.

By 2014, having already earned a reputation as a veteran of the superhero genre, Goyer shifted his focus to the independent production genre, hiring producer Kevin Turen to run his company. Explaining his thinking, Goyer said: &quot;Everybody talks about how it seems like studios increasingly are relying on these big tentpoles and some micro-budget horror films, and that&#x27;s the majority of the slate,&quot; Goyer said. &quot;I&#x27;ve been a benefactor of that movement, but there are a ton of films out there I&#x27;ve really admired over the last few years that studios aren&#x27;t making, and I wanted to see if I could help get more of them made.&quot; In 2015, soon after embracing independent producing, Goyer won a competitive situation to produce the feature version of &quot;Miles&quot;. Furthermore, he executive-produced Nate Parker&#x27;s feature &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, which sold for a record $17.5 million at the Sundance Film Festival, before sweeping the festival&#x27;s awards.

In addition to producing, Goyer continues to write. In 2014, he was tapped to write and produce the feature &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, based on the 1966 original, for James Cameron. Breaking the news, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced: &quot;The project has been quiet since 2011, but Goyer&#x27;s involvement kick-starts and will re-engineer what the studio and producers hope to be an event-sized tentpole. It is also now placing the project on the fast track&quot; In January 2016, acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro signed on to direct the feature. Goyer co-wrote Warner Bros.&#x27; blockbuster &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016), with Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio. In July 2016, it was announced that Goyer will write and direct an upcoming interactive virtual reality film about Darth Vader. Goyer stated that he found creating VR content very different from other media, but said &quot;it&#x27;s surprising how much you feel and how emotional [the VR experience] is [...] there is stuff that makes you tear up and cry, and it&#x27;s really phenomenal.&quot;

In January 2017, Goyer signed on to co-produce and co-write &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot;, an installment in the DC Extended Universe, with Justin Rhodes, based on a story treatment by Goyer and Geoff Johns. By April of the same year, it was announced that he had signed on to write the script for the reboot of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, intended to be released in 2019. Goyer was later announced as director along with Lindsey Beer writing a new draft of the screenplay in January 2018. Filming was set to begin April 2018. By February of that year, Goyer dropped out as the film&#x27;s director and writer. According to Carlos Huante, a creature designer hired for the film and who worked on the original cartoon, Sony felt that Goyer&#x27;s script would be too expensive to bring to life as Goyer intended for the movie to be on the epic scale of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.

In September 2017, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Goyer and his &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; partner Justin Rhodes, as well as Chris Eglee and Josh Friedman were hired to take part in a writers room in order to write the next &quot;Terminator&quot; trilogy, under the direction of collaborating team Tim Miller and James Cameron.

In the early 2020s, Goyer produced &quot;The Night House&quot;, starring Rebecca Hall, as well as the Scott Cooper film &quot;Antlers&quot;. &quot;The Night House&quot; premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival; Searchlight purchased the rights to the film, and released it to critical acclaim in August 2021. Goyer produced the 2021 film &quot;The Tomorrow War&quot;, starring Chris Pratt for Skydance and Amazon. He has been signed on as a producer for the sequel.

Goyer executive produces and serves as showrunner for &quot;Foundation&quot;, which premiered on Apple TV+ on September 24, 2021, and is based on Isaac Asimov&#x27;s novels of the same name. He wrote the first and last episodes as well as directing the season finale. Goyer co-wrote the pilot and serves as executive producer for &quot;The Sandman&quot;, which was released on Netflix on August 5, 2022. Goyer had been involved with an adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book &quot;The Sandman&quot; since he had pitched a story idea in December 2013. By February 2014, he was set to produce a feature film, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but the film&#x27;s development stalled and transitioned into a television show.

For the 2022 film &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, a reimagining of the franchise of the same name, Goyer wrote the story and produced the film under the Phantom Four banner for Spyglass and Hulu. His Phantom Four company had signed a deal with Village Roadshow Pictures.

<doc id="1213783" wikidata="Q11435863" url="?curid=1213783" title="Guadalupe bass">
<text>The Guadalupe bass (Micropterus treculii) is a rare species of fish endemic to the U.S. state of Texas, where it also is the official state fish. It is restricted to creeks and rivers (including the Guadalupe River, hence the name Guadalupe bass), and is listed as near threatened. Today, most fly fishermen and anglers practice catch-and-release techniques to improve fish populations. The Guadalupe bass is often difficult to distinguish from the smallmouth bass or spotted bass, and the fish is known to hybridize.

== Description and range ==
Guadalupe bass, like most black bass, are lime to olive green in color, this particular species being lighter in shade usually in river specimens. They have a lateral line covered in mostly separate diamond-shaped or circular spots, which with age fade from black to olive. Also, many smaller diamond marks are scattered on the back, which are less distinguished than the ones on the lateral line. They have a rectangular tooth patch on the tongue.
Its physical traits are very similar to the spotted bass (i.e. small mouth that does not extend past the eye, sleek figure, etc.) with one exception; the green coloring tends to extend lower on the body past the lateral line than their relatives. So far, the record catch is , caught by Dr. Bryan Townsend of Austin in 2014.

The fish is only found in the Edwards Plateau in central Texas. Its main habitats are the San Marcos, Colorado, Llano, and Guadalupe Rivers, but can also be found in smaller streams such as Barton Creek, Onion Creek, San Gabriel River and the Comal River. The species has also been farm-raised and stocked in the Llano River.

== Threats and predators ==
The Guadalupe bass has almost no predators. Its main threat is not predation, but hybridization with the introduced smallmouth bass. The two species are very closely related and in some rivers almost half the Guadalupe bass are hybrids. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept stated it will likely stock many bass in the future to beat out the hybrid population. This will be a pilot for several other areas where rare spotted bass subspecies are having the same problems.

== Habitat ==
Typically, Guadalupe bass are found in streams and reservoirs; they are absent from extreme headwaters. They prefer flowing waters of streams within native variety, and use covers such as large rocks, cypress trees, or stumps for refuge. Juvenile fish are often found in fast-moving water but begin transitioning to deeper, moderate current towards the end of their first year. 

== Diet ==
The fish (especially juveniles and very old fish), unlike other bass, have an inclination towards insects. Guadalupe bass at their predatory peak prefer larger bait fish such as shad and small bass or bluegills.

== Fishing ==
While almost unheard of elsewhere, the Guadalupe bass is very popular among fishermen in Central Texas. It is prized for its long, tough fights, in which it manipulates the current and its unusually strong muscles, and beautiful colors which tend to be more natural and bright than those of spotted bass. Its preference for strong current and its large diet of insects earned it the name &quot;Texas brook trout&quot; and make it popular for fly fishermen. It fights similarly to both smallmouth bass and rainbow trout—making long runs and manipulating current, but also making sharp turns and attempting to entangle the line on structures, and even making large jumps like both species. 

The IGFA all-tackle world record for the species stands at caught in Lake Travis in Texas in 1983.

== Reproduction ==
Both male and female Guadalupe Bass reach adulthood and sexually maturity at one year of age. Their spawning begins as early as March and continues into June depending on the locale and water conditions. However, unlike many other bass, a secondary spawn is possible in late summer or early fall. The male Guadalupe Bass builds and picks out a gravel nest for spawning in shallow water where there is a high flow rate but out of the way of fast moving water. It is important the male finds a good-looking nest, for these gravel nests attract the females. The female lays between 400 and 9000 eggs, but is chased away by the male immediately after she lays the eggs. From this point on, the male guards the nest from predators and will not eat, but may strike a lure in order to defend its territory. The male Guadalupe stays guard over the fry as they hatch. After hatching, the fry feed on invertebrates.

<doc id="1213789" wikidata="Q7493403" url="?curid=1213789" title="Shelby Lancer">
<text>The Shelby Lancer is a limited-production hatchback sports sedan based on the Dodge Lancer. Modified by Shelby Automobiles in Whittier, California for 1987 and offered in Graphic Red only, the Shelby Lancer was intended to be an American counterpart to European sedans such as the BMW 3 Series and Peugeot 405. It featured many amenities not offered on the normal Lancer, including a special 10-speaker Pioneer CD audio system, one of the first Compact Disc systems offered in an American car. A total of 800 units were produced; 400 came with a 3-speed automatic transmission (A413) and leather interior, and 400 with a 5-speed manual transmission (A520) and cloth interior. Other Shelby-branded items included a numbered plaque attached to the dashboard along with Shelby 15 inch wheels, a Shelby steering wheel, and a Shelby valve cover. The various VIN plates and build labels on the car all indicated &quot;Shelby Automobiles&quot; instead of the typical Chrysler or Dodge labels found on normal production vehicles.

Power came from a Chrysler supplied, Shelby tuned Turbo II 2.2 Liter Intercooled SOHC I4, with and of torque. Weight was just over 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) with the average driver, so performance was not as good as the lighter and lesser-equipped Shelby GLHS. Period 0-60 mph (97 km/h) tests achieved times between 7.2 and 8.0 seconds, and quarter mile times were in the mid to high 15-second range with factory boost levels peaking at about 12 PSI.
Road handling was quite good for a sedan at the time, pulling an advertised 0.85 g on the skidpad. Ride comfort was stiff but not unbearable, providing a good balance between a sport suspension coupe and a touring sedan. Goodyear Gatorback tires, Monroe Formula GP struts and larger sway bars were used to provide a firmer suspension with better grip. Shelby also used an experimental (at the time) 4-wheel disc brake system to improve braking.

Dodge carried on the car for the 1988 and 1989 model years as the Dodge Lancer Shelby, which was assembled at the same Sterling Heights plant as regular Lancers. The Dodge version is actually rarer despite being factory produced, but wasn&#x27;t numbered and lacked some of the Shelby-specific parts such as the shocks, wheels, and rear disk brakes. 279 Lancer Shelbys were produced in 1988 and 208 in 1989 for a total of 487 units. Additionally, a version of the Dodge Lancer Shelby was offered in Europe as the Chrysler GTS Shelby.

<doc id="1213796" wikidata="Q6261837" url="?curid=1213796" title="John Vasconcellos">
<text>John Bernard Vasconcellos Jr. (May 11, 1932 – May 24, 2014) was an American politician from California and member of the Democratic Party. He represented Silicon Valley as a member of the California State Assembly for 30 years and a California State Senator for 8 years. His lifelong interest in psychology led to his advocacy of the self-esteem movement in California politics.

==Early life==
Vasconcellos came from Portuguese (paternal) and German (maternal) roots. He graduated from Bellarmine College Preparatory and Santa Clara University. After graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and valedictorian of his class from Santa Clara, Vasconcellos spent two years as a lieutenant in the United States Army, serving in West Germany. Upon his return, he reenrolled in SCU, obtaining a law degree in 1959. He joined the law firm of Ruffo &amp; Chadwick; after a year, he joined the staff of Governor Pat Brown for one year before returning to the firm.

==Career==
In 1966, Vasconcellos ran for and won a seat in the California State Assembly, taking office January 2, 1967. (Legislative sessions since 1972 have begun on the first Monday in December of even-numbered years.) By 1980 he was one of the longest serving members of the Assembly, second only to Speaker Willie Brown. Due to the Assembly&#x27;s policy of awarding leadership positions based on seniority, he became the chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful assignments in the California Legislature. Vasconcellos proposed the &quot;State Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem&quot; in October 1986. In 1989, Brown appointed Vasconcellos to chair the Select Assembly Committee on Ethics. Vasconcellos held the positions until he was forced out of the Assembly in 1996 by term limits.

He then ran for, and won, a seat in the California State Senate, again representing Silicon Valley. In the State Senate, he chaired the Public Safety, Education, and Economic Development committees. Vasconcellos served two terms in the State Senate, again forced to retire by term limits.

Throughout his long public career Vasconcellos worked to illuminate the link between personal psychology and politics.

In March 2004, Vasconcellos introduced Senate Bill 1606, known as Training Wheels for Citizenship, which would allow people 14 or older to vote. The votes of 14- and 15-year-olds would count as a quarter of a vote, and of 16- and 17-year-olds a half. The National Youth Rights Association supported the bill, but Republican legislators criticized it. Bob Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies, compared this bill&#x27;s fractional vote to the policy of the Three-Fifths Compromise, which gave slaves three-fifths representation in the early history of the U.S. Vasconcellos abandoned the bill after it fell one vote short in the final committee.

Vasconcellos was also a leading champion of medical marijuana. In 1995, he sponsored AB 1529, a bill to legalize personal possession and cultivation of marijuana for medical use. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Wilson, but provided the blueprint for California&#x27;s pioneering medical marijuana initiative, Proposition 215. He went on to sponsor the California Research Act of 1999 (SB 847), which established the California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at U.C. San Diego, and the Medical Marijuana Program Act of 2004 (SB 420), which created a state ID card system for medical marijuana patients and authorized the distribution and cultivation of medical marijuana by patient collectives or cooperatives, laying the groundwork for the legal establishment of California&#x27;s many medical marijuana clubs and dispensaries.

===Later career===
After representing the Silicon Valley for 38 years in the California Legislature, Vasconcellos retired on November 30, 2004. In order to carry forward the vision and leadership of Vasconcellos&#x27; politics, friends and colleagues created The Vasconcellos Project. As its first initiative, The Vasconcellos Project launched the Politics of Trust Network (PTN), a civic engagement enterprise that seeks to become a prime mover in advancing this new vision and practice of politics.

Vasconcellos had the second-longest career of an elected state legislator in California history (after Ralph C. Dills of southern California) and the longest in terms of continuous service. He was known for his work on public education and the state budget during his career in the legislature.

==Death==
Vasconcellos died at his home in Santa Clara, California, from multiple organ failure, thirteen days after his 82nd birthday.

==Honors==
* Commander of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (9 June 1997)

<text>A red diaper baby is a child of parents who were members of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) or the Communist Party of Canada, or were close to the party or sympathetic to its aims.

==History==
In the 1976 film &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, the lead character, Thomas Levy, played by Dustin Hoffman, is a red diaper baby. 

Notable red diaper babies include journalist Carl Bernstein and rock singer Country Joe McDonald. 

The term &quot;Red Diaper Baby&quot; was used by Josh Kornbluth as the title of his 1996 autobiography and related one man show, and a 2004 performance documentary film of his show by Doug Pray. 

In their 1998 book &quot;Red Diapers: Growing Up in the Communist Left&quot;, Judy Kaplan and Linn Shapiro define red diaper babies as &quot;children of CPUSA members, children of former CPUSA members, and children whose parents never became members of the CPUSA but were involved in political, cultural, or educational activities led or supported by the Party&quot;. More generally, the phrase is sometimes used to refer to a child of any radical parent, regardless of that parent&#x27;s past partisan affiliation or the affiliation of the child.

Canadian political scientist James Laxer titled his 2005 memoir &quot;Red Diaper Baby: A Boyhood in the Age of McCarthyism&quot;.

<text>Red Diapers: Growing Up in the Communist Left is the first anthology of autobiographical writings by &quot;Red Diaper Babies&quot; — children of communist or other radical-left parents. Edited by Judy Kaplan and Linn Shapiro, it consists of memoirs, short stories, and poems. Among the 40 authors are such well known figures as journalist Carl Bernstein, feminist writer Kim Chernin, scientist Richard Levins, and author/activist Robert Meeropol (son of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg).

The book has been widely praised by some of the major figures of 20th century radical politics, reviewed in radical and academic periodicals, and used as a textbook in radical history courses at Pennsylvania State University and East Stroudsberg University, as well as being reviewed by the mainstream media.

==Reviews==
*Bettina Aptheker Humbooks, U.C. Santa Cruz: &quot;extraordinary multi-author account of how it felt and what it meant to grow up Communist in twentieth-century America&quot;
*Angela Davis: &quot;A remarkable collective memoir... It bears witness to a powerful tradition of radical &#x27;family values&#x27; from which emerged a generation of leftist organizers who have made an indelible mark on U.S. social movements. Perhaps most importantly, this wonderful volume demystifies the process of radicalization by foregrounding the humanity of those of us whose family legacies have been defined by radicalism.&quot;
*Pat Devine, University of Manchester in Communist History Network Newsletter: &quot;This is a wonderful book. Through it we enter a world populated by ordinary people who did extraordinary things in exceptional circumstances as they worked to make the world a better place.&quot;
*Howard Zinn: &quot;These are fascinating glimpses of the lives of a special group of people, poignant and thought-provoking — an important contribution to the social history of our time.&quot;
*Meredith Tax, Women&#x27;s Review of Books,&quot; April, 1999: &quot;Not only does it address historical issues central to the Left, but also questions of concern to anyone who wants to know how a political subculture can be maintained...&quot;

<text>Dubyago is a lunar impact crater that lies in the eastern limb of the Moon. It was named after Russian astronomers Dmitry Dubyago and Alexander Dubyago. It appears significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. It lies along the southern shore of the Mare Undarum, to the southeast of the crater Firmicus.

This crater has a somewhat worn outer rim which dips down to a low point along the northern rim, and has its maximum altitude along the eastern side. The most notable aspect of this crater, however, is the dark hue of the interior floor which matches the albedo of the lunar mare to the northwest. This darker shading makes the crater stand out somewhat from its surroundings.

Dubyago has an unusual number of satellite craters, several of which have since been given names by the IAU. The most notable of these is Dubyago B, which is nearly attached to the southeastern rim of the main crater.

The name of this crater has also been spelled &quot;Dubiago&quot; in some publications.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dubyago.


The following craters have been renamed by the IAU:
* Dubyago C — &quot;See&quot; Respighi
* Dubyago P — &quot;See&quot; Pomortsev
* Dubyago Q — &quot;See&quot; Stewart
* Dubyago S — &quot;See&quot; Liouville
* Dubyago U — &quot;See&quot; Boethius

<doc id="1213805" wikidata="Q373550" url="?curid=1213805" title="Hemipelvectomy">
<text>Hemipelvectomy, also known as a pelvic resection, is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of part of the pelvic girdle. This procedure is most commonly performed to treat oncologic conditions of the pelvis. Hemipelvectomy can be further classified as &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; hemipelvectomy. An &quot;internal&quot; hemipelvectomy is a limb-sparing procedure where the innominate bone is resected while preserving the ipsilateral limb. An &quot;external&quot; hemipelvectomy involves the resection of the innominate bone plus amputation of the ipsilateral limb.

== Medical uses ==
Hemipelvectomy is generally reserved for the treatment of pelvic neoplasms. Examples of malignancies that are treated with hemipelvectomy include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma. Rarely, hemipelvectomy is performed in settings of traumatic injury and osteomyelitis. Indications for &quot;external&quot; hemipelvectomy include neoplastic extension into the sciatic nerve, where loss of function of the lower extremity is anticipated. &quot;Internal&quot; hemipelvectomy is preferred when complete resection of the tumor is possible without sacrificing the lower extremity. If &quot;external&quot; hemipelvectomy cannot provide a greater degree of tumor resection compared to &quot;internal&quot; hemipelvectomy, &quot;internal&quot; hemipelvectomy is recommended. &quot;Internal&quot; hemipelvectomy must only be considered when the surgical approach can ensure the preservation of critical neurovascular structures in the region.

== Complications ==
As with any surgical procedure, risks include infection, blood loss, damage to surrounding structures, cardiac/pulmonary complications, and adverse reactions to anesthesia.

Complications of &quot;external&quot; hemipelvectomy include:
* Disfigurement
* Loss of ambulation
* Phantom limb pain
* Bladder dysfunction
* Sexual dysfunction
* Bowel dysfunction
Complications of &quot;internal&quot; hemipelvectomy include:
* Leg-length discrepancy
* &#x27;Flail hip&#x27; or &#x27;floating hip&#x27; (referring to hypermobility of the hip joint)
* Hip instability

== Technique ==
Prior to performing a hemipelvectomy, surgeons must possess detailed knowledge of the pelvic anatomy and its relation to the pelvic tumor. Imaging studies such as conventional radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging help the surgeon visualize the anatomy and its relationship to the local pathology. Surgical oncology techniques are utilized when resecting tumors of the pelvis. Such techniques ensure that adequate resection margins are obtained at the time of surgery to minimize tumor recurrence.

The Enneking and Dunham classification system was developed in 1978 to aid surgeons in characterizing pelvic resections. This classification scheme breaks down pelvic resections into 3 subtypes: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Type I resections involve removal of the ilium. Type II resections involve removal of the peri-acetabular region. Type III resections involve removal of the ischial and/or pubic region.

Resection of pelvic bone typically requires subsequent reconstruction to ensure stability of the hip joint, particularly in &quot;internal&quot; hemipelvectomy. Examples of pelvic reconstruction include the use of an allograft, autograft, or prosthesis to bridge the remaining ends of pelvic bone following resection. Arthrodesis is a technique that can be used in &quot;internal&quot; hemipelvectomy to fix the proximal femur to a segment of pelvic bone for the purposes of stabilizing the lower extremity.

<text>NRN is a television station originating in Coffs Harbour, Australia. The station is owned by WIN Corporation as part of the WIN Network. As a Network 10 program affiliate, it relays 10 content into the northern New South Wales broadcast market. The station was formally a partnership between NRN-11 Coffs Harbour (launched 23 January 1965) and RTN-8 Lismore (launched 12 May 1962).

==History==

===Origins===
NRN11 Coffs Harbour had merged with ECN8 Taree to form &quot;Northern Rivers Television&quot;, but later demerged in 1969. Around 1971, RTN8 Lismore and NRN11 merged, also forming &quot;Northern Rivers Television&quot; (NRTV), but was known on-air originally as &quot;11–8 Television&quot;. The merged stations served the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers areas of Northern New South Wales. During the mid-1970s, the station was concurrently known as &quot;Great Eastland Television&quot;, when the partnership shared programming and advertising with NEN-9 Tamworth and DDQ-10 Toowoomba/SDQ-4 Warwick, but they soon reverted to the &quot;NRTV&quot; brand.

In 1983, NRTV was relayed into the Gold Coast after a lobbying campaign from residents, although they could also watch the commercial television stations from Brisbane. NRTV&#x27;s Gold Coast studios and offices were constructed in Ashmore on Southport Nerang Road. The Gold Coast facilities didn&#x27;t contain a newsroom, although relayed local news from the Coffs Harbour studios. News crews from Lismore travelled to the Gold Coast for stories of importance.

NRTV produced a considerable amount of local activity (approximately five each week). Local content included local news, three hours of live women&#x27;s variety &quot;Round About&quot;, 5 half-hours of live children&#x27;s variety &quot;Get Set&quot;, &quot;Birthdays&quot;, and &quot;Razzamataz, with on-air presenter Rhonda Logan&quot; weekly, holiday specials &quot;Summerthon&quot;, and a half-hour daily exercise program &quot;Jazzacize&quot;. Live sports specials included the annual Grafton Cup Racing Carnival and the Grafton to Inverell Cycling Classic.

Live programs mainly originated from the Coffs Harbour Studios with programs being recorded at both the networks other studios located at Lismore and Gold Coast.

Some of the memorable names from that era were:
* Ron Lawrence – Ron died in 2008. He was the driving force behind the network&#x27;s local production. He began his career as booth announcer at the Lismore Radio and TV Studios of Northern Star Holdings (RTN 8) and (Radio 2LM) after graduating from Jim Illife&#x27;s AIR-TV College in Brisbane. He moved to Coffs Harbour TV studios in the early 70s after the merge between NRN11 and RTN 8 and became the station announcer–news reader. Later in his career he became Program Manager then later Station Manager and finally General Manager before retiring in the 90s
* Wayne Magee, also a diploma graduate from the Brisbane College AIR-TV (formally with Radio 4GY Gympie (1971), BCV TV Victoria 1971–1975) and National Nine News Adelaide 1975–1976) started with the NRN–RTN Network in 1976 (1976–88). During his time with the network he hosted the children&#x27;s program &quot;Get Set&quot;, network specials and telethon, was booth announcer and read local Monday to Friday TV news. He was appointed as the network&#x27;s Executive Producer of Programs overseeing local production conducted in the three studios located at Coffs Harbour, Goonellabah, and in the 4GG Radio complex on the Gold Coast. Wayne eventually moved into management before leaving the network to become a minister or religion. He was later elected to the position of National President of the Pentecostal Christian Denomination - The Church of the Foursquare Gospel (Australia), served on the Foursquare Eastern Council of Foursquare Churches, Chaired the South Pacific FMI Regional Council and was a member of the Foursquare Missions International Global Council board based in Los Angeles.
* Chris Wordsworth who hailed from Townsville QLD and who had worked previously in radio. Chris hosted the children&#x27;s show for a period and read main bulletin news Monday to Friday. He later joined Channel Seven Sydney as late edition news reader – journalist, was briefly a Chief of Staff for a QLD Politician and later assumed roles of Queensland news director with ABC and WIN Network.
* Greg Hughes who succeeded Wordsworth as News Reader and station announcer. He formally had worked for the Mike Walsh owned Penrith radio station. In the early 1990s Greg moved to Canberra to join the 2CC Breakfast Club, a team that later moved to sister station Mix 106.3. Greg also presented the weather on Ten Capital in Canberra for several years from the mid-1990s to 2001. He left broadcasting to work for the Army PR Dept.
* Rhonda Logan was the on-air presenter of &#x27;Birthdays&#x27; and children&#x27;s television show &#x27;Razzamataz&#x27; and presented &#x27;Weather&#x27; during the nightly news for three years. Rhonda simultaneously worked in commercial and community radio: (2CS) (2CHY-FM) and was a weekly columnist for newspapers,&#x27;Harbour Views&#x27;, &#x27;Coffs Harbour Advocate&#x27;.

In December 1987, NRN and sister station RTN were sold by Northern Star for $75 million to Darling Downs TV, a vehicle controlled by David Haynes, which at the time owned the Ten station in Brisbane.

===1990s===
1990 saw plans for NRTV to be merged with southern Queensland&#x27;s Vision TV to form a larger regional network to respond to the growing aggregation of television into regional areas of the nation, but they were called off. On 31 December 1991, Northern New South Wales became the third area to be aggregated, and NRTV, via links to Network 10 (it was part of Northern Star Holdings), owned by Westfield Group chairman Frank Lowy), became its affiliate in the region. At one stage, NRTV was the subject of a bid from WIN Television. Nothing came of it, but had WIN gone through with the bid, it would have made &quot;NRTV&quot; the Nine Network affiliate (using the logos of its parent station in southern NSW and the campaigns of the Nine Network, attempting a replication of the affiliation steal during the 1990 aggregation of Regional Queensland television) and would have left &quot;NBN&quot; as Network 10&#x27;s affiliate instead in the area.
NRTV was sold to Telecasters Australia in 1993, who also owned the Queensland affiliate of Network 10. In 1994, the station was renamed &quot;Ten Northern NSW&quot;, and its station identification was changed to that of Network 10. The station stopped producing regional news for Coffs Harbour, Lismore and Gold Coast. They had previously produced a licence-wide bulletin, but that was axed due to poor ratings.

===2000s===
Ten Northern NSW (NRN) and Telecasters itself were purchased by Southern Cross Broadcasting in 2001. The following year, NRN was rebranded to Southern Cross Ten. On 14 August 2005, the station and the whole Southern Cross Ten network, received a new star logo.

Southern Cross commenced broadcasting Ten secondary channel One HD via NRN on 2 July 2009 on LCN 50.

===2010s===
Southern Cross commenced running new Network Ten secondary channel Eleven via NRN on 11 January 2011 on LCN 55, replacing a simulcast of the main channel.

On 1 July 2016, Southern Cross Ten&#x27;s unique branding began to phase out on NRN in favour of Ten&#x27;s mainstream branding as &quot;Ten&quot;. This comes after Southern Cross switched all of its SC10 stations (except NRN) as Southern Cross Nine as part of its new program supply agreement with the Nine Network. Southern Cross announced on 13 September 2016 that 10 HD would be launched on LCN 52 on 21 September 2016. In addition, 10 Bold was reduced to a standard definition broadcast to accommodate 10 HD.

Southern Cross announced on 25 July 2016, that it would commence broadcasting a New Zealand-based datacast shopping channel, Yesshop via NRN on 1 August 2016 on LCN 54. However, Yesshop&#x27;s owner (Yes Retail) made the decision to cease trading on 29 September 2016 citing lack of funds to pay wages and the company&#x27;s current losses of approximately 20 million dollars. Employees were terminated the same day, and the channels were removed on Freeview later that day.

In late January 2017, it was announced that Southern Cross had entered into negotiations with WIN Corporation, owners of regional Ten-affiliate WIN Television, over the sale of NRN in exchange for WIN&#x27;s Wollongong radio station i98FM. This deal would have expanded WIN&#x27;s television coverage across all regional markets in the eastern states and granted Southern Cross radio coverage in Wollongong. Southern Cross later withdrew from negotiations on 20 February 2017 with no explanation given. However, WIN and Southern Cross later finalised an agreement where they would sell NRN to WIN for a total of $55 million, with the sale taking effect on 31 May 2017. NRN was maintained as &quot;Ten Northern NSW&quot; until playout and transmission were transferred to WIN&#x27;s MediaHub facility in Ingleburn on 1 September 2017, when the station adopted the WIN branding. The LCNs were also reshuffled for NRN to align with WIN&#x27;s other stations, but as Nine-owned NBN Television holds the 8-numbered digital channels in northern NSW, NRN&#x27;s digital channels remain on the 5-numbered digital channels.

===2020s===
On 23 June 2021, WIN announced that it renewed its programme and supply agreement with Paramount Global, the owner of Network Ten since 2020, for NRN. However, as WIN&#x27;s main station&#x27;s channels in other markets were rebranded from 1 July under a new PSA with the Nine Network, the Northern NSW station also dropped WIN&#x27;s own branding outside its local news content, and carried the Network 10 branding seen in metropolitan markets.

Unlike other Ten affiliates, as of 2023, NRN does not broadcast Paramount-owned channel 10 Shake, and its successor Nickelodeon Australia.

On 13 February 2025, Network 10 announced they would be acquiring NRN from WIN Television. This followed Network 10&#x27;s announcement that they would also be acquiring Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s 10-affiliated stations. The sale is currently pending.

==News==
From 2004 until 2017, Southern Cross produced short local news updates which are broadcast throughout the day. These bulletins were branded as Southern Cross Ten News, Southern Cross News, Ten Local News Updates from 1 July 2016. The updates were produced from Southern Cross&#x27; Canberra studios and made use of news content from local radio stations owned by Southern Cross Austereo in each market. Local sport and weather reports also aired on an sporadic basis. Short updates also aired throughout the day and evening alongside updates from Ten Eyewitness News. The bulletins were researched, produced and presented by a single journalist.

Though the purchase of NRN by WIN was finalised on 31 May 2017, playout and transmission remained under Southern Cross&#x27; control until 1 September, when WIN formally assumed control over the station. During this interim period, Southern Cross continued to produce local news updates for NRN until 31 August. From 1 September 2017, WIN News took over the production of short local updates for NRN, which may run from 30 seconds to two minutes each. The updates are presented from WIN&#x27;s Wollongong headquarters, with rotating presenters.

Upon acquiring NRN, WIN has not launched nor produced a local news bulletin for the region, citing changes to media landscape, decline in traditional television viewership, and due to their affiliation with Network 10.

NRN also aired WIN&#x27;s All Australian News, a compilation news bulletin featuring news reports from WIN&#x27;s newsrooms across regional Australia, despite the fact that no local stories from Northern NSW and Gold Coast were aired on this bulletin. The programme ended its airing on 30 June 2021, after WIN made adjustments to its news output following the return of Nine Network&#x27;s programmes to WIN-owned stations outside Northern NSW the following day.

As a Network 10 affiliate, NRN also transmits &quot;Studio 10&quot;, &quot;The Project&quot; and &quot;10 News First&quot;.

==Main transmitters==

<doc id="1213814" wikidata="Q919502" url="?curid=1213814" title="Firmicus (crater)">
<text>Firmicus is a lunar impact crater that lies in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side, so that from Earth it appears oval in shape due to foreshortening. It is, however, very nearly circular. The crater is located to the west of the Mare Undarum, and northeast of the similar-sized crater Apollonius. To the north of Firmicus are the craters van Albada and Auzout. Attached to its northwest rim is the Lacus Perseverantiae, a miniature lunar mare.

The crater is named after 4th century Roman astrologer Julius Firmicus Maternus. The name was formally adopted by the IAU in 1935.

The most notable aspect of Firmicus is the dark, flat floor. It has a similar albedo to the surface of Mare Crisium to the north, making it stand out somewhat from its surroundings. The floor has suffered no significant impacts since it was created, although there are undoubtedly many minor impacts across its surface. The outer rim of Firmicus has undergone some erosion, particularly along the northern rim where it is overlain by a pair of small craterlets.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Firmicus.

<doc id="1213825" wikidata="Q2927659" url="?curid=1213825" title="Buffon (crater)">
<text>Buffon is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies a crater diameter south of the large walled plain Chebyshev. To the northeast is the crater Langmuir and to the southwest is Leavitt. Buffon lies nearly at the midpoint between these formations.

This is a worn and eroded crater formation, with a circular rim that can″ still be traced through the rugged terrain but which is irregular and rounded due to a history of lesser impacts. The most notable of these is a tiny crater which lies across the northern rim and the satellite crater Buffon D which lies along the inner eastern wall. The interior floor, although generally level, is equally rugged and irregular, particularly in the eastern half.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Buffon.

<doc id="1213828" wikidata="Q309177" url="?curid=1213828" title="Sukhoi Su-34">
<text>The Sukhoi Su-34 (; NATO reporting name: Fullback) is a Soviet-origin Russian twin-engine, twin-seat, all-weather supersonic medium-range fighter-bomber/strike aircraft. It first flew in 1990, intended for the Soviet Air Forces, and it entered service in 2014 with the Russian Air Force.

Based on the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker air superiority fighter, the Su-34 has a wider, armoured cockpit with side-by-side seating for its two pilots. The Su-34 was designed primarily for tactical deployment against ground and naval targets (tactical bombing/attack/interdiction roles, including against small and mobile targets) on solo and group missions in daytime and at night, under favourable and adverse weather conditions and in a hostile environment with counter-fire and electronic warfare (EW) counter-measures deployed, as well as for aerial reconnaissance. The Su-34 is planned to eventually replace the Su-24 tactical bomber and the Tu-22M long-range bomber.

==Development==
===Beginnings (1980s)===
The Su-34 had a murky and protracted beginning. In the mid-1980s, Sukhoi began developing a new tactical multirole combat aircraft to replace the swing-wing Su-24, which would incorporate a host of conflicting requirements. The bureau thus selected the Su-27, which excelled in maneuverability and range, and could carry a large payload, as the basis for the new fighter-bomber. More specifically, the aircraft was developed from , the naval trainer derivative of the Sukhoi Su-27K. The development, known internally as T-10V, was shelved at the end of the 1980s sharing the fate of the aircraft carrier &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot;; this was the result of the political upheaval in the Soviet Union and its subsequent disintegration.

===First prototype (1990)===
In August 1990, a photograph taken by a TASS officer showed an aircraft making a dummy approach towards the aircraft carrier &quot;Tbilisi&quot;. The aircraft, subsequently and erroneously labelled Su-27KU by Western intelligence, made its maiden flight on 13 April 1990 with Anatoliy Ivanov at the controls. Converted from an Su-27UB with the new distinctive nose, while retaining the main undercarriage of previous Su-27s, it was a prototype for the Su-27IB (IB stands for &quot;istrebitel-bombardirovshchik&quot;, or &quot;fighter bomber&quot;). It was developed in parallel with the two-seat naval trainer, the Su-27KUB. However, contrary to earlier reports, the two aircraft are not directly related. Flight tests continued throughout 1990 and into 1991.

In 1992, the Su-27IB was displayed to the public at the MosAeroshow (later renamed &quot;MAKS Airshow&quot;), where it demonstrated aerial refuelling with an Il-78, and performed an aerobatic display. The aircraft was officially unveiled on 13 February 1992 at Machulishi, where Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) leaders were holding a summit. The following year, the Su-27IB was again displayed at the MAKS Airshow.

===Second prototype (1993)===
The next prototype, and first pre-production aircraft, T10V-2, first flew on 18 December 1993, with Igor Votintsev and Yevgeniy Revoonov at the controls. Built at Novosibirsk, where Su-24s were constructed, this aircraft was visibly different from the original prototype; it had modified vertical stabilizers, twin tandem main undercarriage and a longer &quot;stinger&quot;, which houses an N012 rearward-facing warning radar, plus the drogue chute, as well as a fuel jettison outlet.

===Standard Su-34 (1994)===

The first aircraft built to production standard made its maiden flight on 28 December 1994. It was fitted with a fire-control system, at the heart of which was the Leninets OKB-designed V004 passive electronically scanned array radar. It was different enough from the earlier versions that it was re-designated the &quot;Su-34&quot;. However, at the 1995 Paris Air Show, the aircraft was allocated the &quot;Su-32FN&quot; designation, signalling the aircraft&#x27;s potential role as a shore-based naval aircraft for the Russian Naval Aviation. Sukhoi also promoted the Su-34 as the &quot;Su-32MF&quot; (&quot;MnogoFunksionalniy&quot;, &quot;multi-function&quot;).

Budget restrictions caused the programme to stall repeatedly. Nevertheless, flight testing continued, albeit at a slow pace. The third pre-production aircraft first flew in late 1996.

===Further development (2016–present)===

Russia&#x27;s Ministry of Defence plans to modernize the Su-34; according to the deputy head of the military department, Yuriy Borisov, &quot;We are planning to modernize the aircraft: prolong its service life, increase the number of airborne weapons. Plane is in great demand in our armed forces, and it has a great future.&quot;

Russia is developing two new versions of the aircraft: one for electronic warfare (L700 Tarantul ECM pod can provide electronic cover for a group of aircraft) and one for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

&quot;Su-34M&quot; modernised version is to feature a new electro-optical infrared targeting pod, a Kopyo-DL rearward facing radar that can warn the pilots if missiles are approaching, combined with automatic deployment of countermeasures and jamming.

==Orders and deliveries==
===Su-34 (2004–2021)===
An initial batch of eight aircraft was completed by the Novosibirsk factory in 2004. In March 2006, Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Ivanov announced the purchase of the first five pre-production Su-34s for the Russian Air Force. In late 2008, a second contract was signed for delivery of 32 aircraft by 2015. A total of 70 aircraft were to be purchased by 2015 to replace some 300 Su-24s in service at the time, which were then undergoing a modernization program. Ivanov claimed that as it is &quot;many times more effective on all critical parameters&quot;, fewer of these newer bombers are required than the old Su-24 it replaces. In December 2006, Ivanov stated that approximately 200 Su-34s were expected to be in service by 2020. This was confirmed by Russian Air Force chief Vladimir Mikhaylov on 6 March 2007. Two Su-34s were delivered in 2006–2007, and three more were delivered by the end of 2009.
On 9 January 2008, Sukhoi reported that the Su-34 had begun full-rate production. The final stage of the state tests were completed on 19 September 2011.

The Russian Air Force received another four Su-34s on 28 December 2010, as combat units in airbases first received six Su-34s in 2011. Delivery came in the form of two contracts, the first in 2008 for 32 aircraft and the second in 2012 for a further 92 aircraft, totaling 124 to be delivered by 2020.

In December 2012, Sukhoi reportedly delivered five aircraft under the 2012 State Defence Order.

On 6 May 2013, the first Su-34s under the 2013 defence procurement plan were delivered. On 9 July 2013, three more Su-34s were delivered in an official acceptance ceremony held at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. By the end of 2013, Sukhoi completed the 2008 contract and started deliveries of aircraft under the 2012 contract.

In August 2013, Sukhoi ordered 184 identification friend or foe transponders for the Russian Su-34s from the Kazan-based Radiopribor holding company, to be delivered by 2020.

On 10 June 2014, a further delivery of Su-34s was made to the 559th Bomber Aviation Regiment at Morozovsk Air Base. Another three aircraft were delivered on 18 July 2014. In total, 18 aircraft were delivered in 2014, with 20 planned to be delivered in 2015.

Sukhoi delivered the first batch of Su-34s under the 2015 defence procurement plan on 21 May 2015. On 16 July 2015, the Sukhoi Company handed over another batch of Su-34 frontline bombers to the Russian Defence Ministry. The transfer took place in the framework of the Unified Military Hardware Acceptance Day in the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association Plant.

Algerian deal: after eight years of negotiations, Rosoboronexport received official request to supply the Su-34 to the Algerian Air Force.

The last two Su-34s of the 2012 contract were delivered to the 968th Fighter Aviation Regiment at the Lipetsk Air Base in December 2020. This brought the total number of operational aircraft delivered to the Russian Aerospace Forces to 131 (not counting crashes and aircraft written off). Apart from this, also seven pre-production units were built under previous contracts.

On 25 August 2020, the Russian Defence Ministry signed a third contract for a further 24 Su-34 aircraft for the Russian Aerospace Forces. The deliveries will stretch over three years. By December 2021, the Russian Aerospace Forces received six new aircraft of the third order.

===Su-34M (2022–present)===
In June 2022, the Russian Aerospace Forces received another four aircraft of the third order. These were the first aircraft built under the new &quot;Su-34M&quot; standard. They became part of the 277th Bomber Aviation Regiment.

In August 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defence signed a new contract for supply of Su-34 bombers.

In November 2022, Russia received a new batch of Sukhoi Su-34s of the modernized Su-34M variant; the number is yet unknown but it is safe to assume it was at least four units. Another batch of modernized Su-34Ms was handed over to the Russian Aerospace Forces in late December 2022. At this point, the total number of Su-34s produced under all contracts, including seven prototypes and pre-production units, reached at least 153 units. New batches were delivered in June, October and November 2023 and in April, June, September, October, November and December 2024 with at least 10 aircraft delivered in total throughout the year.

==Design==
The Su-34 shares most of its wing structure, tail, and engine nacelles with the Su-27/Su-30, with canards like the Su-30MKI, Su-33 and Su-27M/35 to increase static instability (higher manoeuvrability) and to reduce trim drag.

The Su-34 is powered by a pair of Saturn AL-31FM1 turbofan engines, the same engines used on the Su-27SM, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of Mach 1.8+ when fully loaded. Although slower than the standard Su-27, the Su-34 can still handle high G-loads and perform aerobatic maneuvers. When equipped with a full weapons load, the Su-34 has a maximum range of , or further with aerial refueling. The airframe is cleared to perform maneuvers of up to +9 g. The noise level of the Su-34 is two times lower than the level of its predecessors.

The Su-34 is a three lifting surface design having both a conventional horizontal tailplane at the rear and a canard foreplane in front of the main wings. The foreplane provides both additional lift (force) and greater maneuverability. It has twin tail fins like those of Su-27 from which it is derived. The Su-34 has 12 hardpoints for of ordnance, intended to include the latest Russian precision-guided weapons. It retains the 30 mm GSh-30-1 cannon of the Su-27 and Su-30, and the ability to carry six R-77 or R-73 air-to-air missiles, with these being primarily for defense against pursuers if detected by the rearward facing radar. The maximum weight of any single munition carried is . Its stand-off weapons have a range of up to . A Khibiny electronic countermeasures (ECM) system is fitted as standard.
Compared to other members of the Flanker family, the Su-34 has an entirely new &quot;Duckbill&quot; nose and forward fuselage designed to increase cabin room and maximize crew comfort and safety, giving the Su-34 the nickname &quot;Duckling&quot;, &quot;Hellduck&quot; or &quot;Platypus&quot;. The two pilots sit side-by-side in NPP Zvezda K-36DM ejection seats: the pilot-commander on the left with the navigator and weapon operator on the right. An advantage of the side by side cockpit is that duplicate instruments are not required for each pilot. Since long missions require comfort, the pressurization system allows operation up to without oxygen masks, which are available for emergencies and combat situations.

The crew members have room to stand and move about the cabin during long missions. The space between the seats allows them to lie down, if necessary. A hand-held urinal &quot;toilet&quot; and vacuum flask &quot;kitchen&quot; are provided. A ladder attached to the nose landing gear and a hatch in the cockpit floor is used to enter the cockpit. The cockpit is a continuous capsule of armour (17 mm).

The multifunctional Leninets V004 main radar has terrain-following and terrain avoidance modes. Maximum detection range for the passive electronically scanned array forward radar is against large surface targets, to cover the rear a second aft-facing radar is mounted. The main radar can simultaneously track ten air targets and attack four targets (in the air, on land or on the water). The radius of detection for fighter-sized targets is up to 120 km, the range of the survey is +/- 60 degrees. The rear warning radar system can warn of attack from behind and allow it to fire its R-73 missiles against pursuers without needing to turn the aircraft. The rear radar is from Phazotron/Rassvet, and is unofficially called the N-012. The Su-34 reportedly has a frontal radar cross-section that is an order of magnitude smaller than prior generation fighters.

A new 4th generation radar Pika-M of the complex BKR-3, having a range up to 300 km, passed state tests in 2016. As of 2021, several aircraft of the RuAF have passed modernization with special equipment that increases capabilities in detecting air and ground targets and expand the types of weapons used.
==Operational history==
===Russia===
====Trials, early service====
The Su-34 is rumoured to have made its combat debut during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

In July 2010, several Su-34s and Su-24Ms conducted a non-stop flight from air bases in European Russia to the Russian Far East. The exercise included aircraft carrying weapons at full load and simulated delivering them on targets, demonstrating the Su-34&#x27;s long-range capability. The Su-24Ms were refuelled three times, while the Su-34s were refuelled twice.

The final stage of the Su-34&#x27;s state trials was completed on 19 September 2011 and the aircraft entered service in early 2014. Russia plans to have 124 aircraft in use by 2020. It is planned to increase to 200 aircraft later.

====Crashes, other accidents====
* On 4 June 2015, an Su-34 slid off the runway and flipped over when its parachute failed to open after landing. Nobody was injured. The aircraft was returning from a routine training mission in Russia&#x27;s Voronezh region. In June 2016, the damaged aircraft was transferred on board an Antonov An-124 to the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association plant for repairs, and was likely returned to service the same year.
* On 18 January 2019, two Su-34s collided mid-air in Russia&#x27;s Far East region, while performing a scheduled training flight. Two pilots were killed, one was rescued and one remained missing. All Su-34 flights were suspended throughout Russia following the accident.
* On 6 September 2019, two Su-34s again collided mid-air, this time in the western Russian city of Lipetsk. According to a Russian source the collision happened due to pilot error. Both pilots managed to land after the accident.
* On 21 October 2020, an Su-34 crashed performing a training flight in Khabarovsk region.
* On 17 October 2022, a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber crashed into the courtyard of a residential apartment complex in the Russian city of Yeysk during a training flight, setting two blocks on fire. 15 people were killed and 19 were treated in hospital. A school was evacuated. Russian defense ministry sources stated the cause of the crash was an engine fire on takeoff and that both pilots ejected safely. Locals were seen rescuing one of the pilots. Russian naval aviation uses Yeysk as a main training area.
* On 20 April 2023, an Su-34 of the Russian Aerospace Forces was performing a flight over the Russian city of Belgorod when a release of an air ordnance occurred, shattering windows, damaging cars and leaving a crater of about 20 meters in diameter. Three people were injured.
* On 20 September 2023, an Su-34 &quot;Red 05&quot;, RF-95806 crashed in Russia&#x27;s Voronezh region, without any damage to personnel or ground structures. Both pilots ejected safely.
* On 10 June 2024, an Su-34 crashed during a training flight in the mountains of North Ossetia, killing both pilots.

====Syrian Civil War====
=====Russian intervention in Syria (2015–2020)=====


In September 2015, six Su-34s arrived at Latakia airport in Syria, for attacks against rebel and ISIL forces. Russian air attacks in Syria started on 30 September, in the Homs region. On 1 October, the Su-34 was used to bomb Islamic State targets in Syria. The Russian Aerospace Forces Su-34 fighter-bombers destroyed an Islamic State command center and training camp south-west of the city of Raqqa. These included precision strikes from an altitude of over 5,000 m (16,400 ft).

Russian Su-34 and Su-25 attack aircraft carried out air strikes the next day against Islamic State targets in Syria&#x27;s Hama province using precision bombs. According to Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, Su-34s hit an ISIL fortified bunker in the Hama province with guided bombs. Fortifications, ammunition depots, seven units of the military equipment near Syria&#x27;s Maarrat al-Numan were also destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces. An ISIL command center and underground depot were also destroyed with explosives near Raqqa.

Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said in a statement on 3 October: &quot;Accurate delivery of a concrete-piercing bomb BETAB-500 launched from an Su-34 aircraft near Raqqa destroyed a hardened command centre of one of the illegal armed groups as well as an underground bunker with explosives and an ammunition depot.&quot; A Russian Aerospace Forces representative stated Su-34s acquire targets using the GLONASS satellite system for bombing. During this time six Su-34s were in Syria.

Following the downing of an Su-24 by Turkey, Russia announced on 30 November 2015 that Su-34s in Syria had begun flying combat missions while armed with air-to-air missiles. On 16 August 2016, Tu-22M3 long-range bombers and Su-34 bombers, having taken off from their base in Hamadan, Islamic Republic of Iran, carried out group airstrikes against targets belonging to ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist groups in the provinces of Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor and Idlib.

On 3 October 2017, Russian Su-34s and Su-35s were deployed to strike &quot;the place of the Al-Nusra leadership meeting&quot; whose location was discovered by Russian military intelligence in Syria subsequently eliminating 12 Al-Nusra field commanders and some 50 militants of the group including Ahmad al-Ghizai, Al-Nusra&#x27;s security chief according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

On 28 May 2018, it was reported that Russian Su-34s intercepted two Israeli Air Force F-16s over Tripoli, Lebanon, forcing them to retreat.

On 27 February 2020, two Russian Su-34s allegedly carried out an airstrike on a Turkish military convoy killing up to 36 soldiers and injuring at least 60 more in Balyun, Syria.

On 6 October 2020, two Russian Su-34s conducted air strikes against underground structures in the Eastern bank of Euphrates, Deir Ez-Zor province allegedly inside Rojava territory resulting in the death of ISIL field commander Abu Qatada, who was involved in preparing an attack against Russian forces which resulted in the death of Major General Vyacheslav Gladkikh. Additionally, the strike also destroyed two underground shelters and killed some 30 militants.

====Russo-Ukrainian War====
=====Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)=====


On 28 February 2022, footage emerged reportedly showing Su-34s overflying the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. In various regions of Ukraine, downed Su-34 aircraft were mostly shot down by Ukrainian forces but some crashed for other reasons. One Su-34 was in a flat spin before it crashed. A modernized variant Su-34M was reportedly shot down by Russian forces. There were reports of pilots ejecting with some dying and some captured. Most of the downed planes were identified by their red tail numbers and registration numbers, for example, Red 31 with RF-81251. Until the deployment of the Russian GPS-guided UMPK (Unified Gliding and Correction Module) bomb kits in 2023, a lack of guided bombs required the Su-34s to fly low for accurate bombing, where they were subjected to heavy Ukrainian air-defenses.

As of 16 February 2025, there have been 36 Su-34s and 1 Su-34M visually confirmed as being lost, damaged or abandoned by Russian forces since the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine (29 destroyed in combat, 4 destroyed in a non-combat related incident and 4 damaged). Ukraine launched several surprise attacks on Russian Su-34 fighter bombers in the occupied south of Kherson and Mariupol using American-supplied long-range MIM-104 Patriot missiles, causing significant losses of Russian Su-34. As Ukraine fought on, Russia lost almost 36 Su-34 fighter bombers until June 2024.
======Dated list of Su-34s shot down in the Russo-Ukrainian War======

;2024
* On 4 January 2024, it was reported a saboteur attempted to set fire to a Su-34 parked at the Chelyabinsk Shagol Airport. A video of the act was published by Ukrainian GUR. The saboteur attempted to ignite a fire inside the right air intake of the aircraft but was unsuccessful due to distance between the air intake itself and the engine. The following day on 5 January 2024, it was reported that the Russian Federal Security Service detained a Russian national who was allegedly involved in the sabotage.

======Unconfirmed losses claimed by Ukraine======
* On 30 January 2024, Ukrainian forces claimed a Russian Su-34 was shot down over Luhansk Oblast, Eastern Ukraine. Mykola Oleshchuk, a Ukrainian General said, &quot;Units of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed three enemy aircraft at once—two Su-34 fighter-bombers and one Su-35 fighter,&quot; on Telegram on February 17. He said Ukraine shot down another Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber on the morning of February 18. Oleshchuk said that Ukrainian forces took down additional Su-34 fighter bombers, the seventh Su-34 plane reportedly destroyed by Ukraine within the week. On 27 February 2024 Oleshchuk reported that Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian Su-34 on the eastern front. Later that day another Russian Su-34 was reportedly shot down by Ukrainian forces. On 29 February Ukraine claimed it shot down three Su-34s. In total in February 2024 the Ukrainian Air Force claimed it had shot down ten Su-34 aircraft. As of 27 February 2024, none of the claims have been independently verified.

* On the night of 13–14 June 2024, officials from the Ukrainian GUR claimed that two Su-34s were damaged during a Ukrainian drone strike on the Morozovsk air base. There are reports of casualties however these were not officially confirmed.

* On 14 August 2024, the Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down a Su-34 over Kursk Oblast.

====Non-military usage====
Sukhoi Su-34s were used on bombing runs against ice jams on the rivers in Vologda Oblast to prevent floods during the spring of 2016.

===Algerian purchase===
In January 2016, Algeria was negotiating a purchase of 12 aircraft for its Air Force. The deal should have been signed in late 2016, but in 2017 the talks were still ongoing and no sale was made. On 27 December 2019, Algeria reportedly signed a contract for 14 aircraft as part of large military deal that also includes purchase of Su-35 and Su-57 fighters. However, neither the Russian nor Algerian governments ever confirmed that such a deal had been made.

According to Mil.press, after eight years of fruitless negotiations with Algeria on selling Su-32 (export version), in 2019 Russia agreed to sell the modernized, non-downgraded Su-34ME version; Algeria became interested in the model after the campaign in Syria, where the aircraft demonstrated excellent combat qualities. Production of the first batch was underway as of March 2021 and, according to CAWAT, should be ready in 2021. Training of Algerian pilots would commence in 2022, with all planes to be delivered by 2023. According to a 17 March 2021 news article from Middle East Monitor (MEMO), a representative of the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation (FSVTS) in Russia denied the claim that Russia was manufacturing aircraft for Algeria.

==Variants==
* Su-34 – basic aircraft model.
* Su-32 – export model, offered to Algeria in 2012.
* Su-34M / Su-34 NVO (Навигация и Внешнее Оборудование, &quot;Navigation and External Equipment Upgrade&quot;) – modernized version, also known as &quot;Su-34 Sych&quot; (Russian for Athene). The Russian contract was signed in 2020 and replaced basic Su-34 in production. According to reports, this upgrade seriously affects almost all of the aircraft&#x27;s avionics. The radar, sight, and communication systems improved. The range of guided munitions that the bomber can use significantly expanded. EW capabilities also expanded with introduction of new hardpoints. The version was reportedly armed with long range cruise missiles in September 2023.

<doc id="1213833" wikidata="Q2470820" url="?curid=1213833" title="Five Live Yardbirds">
<text>Five Live Yardbirds is the live debut album by the English rock band the Yardbirds. It features the group&#x27;s interpretations of ten American blues and rhythm and blues songs, including their most popular live number, Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;. The album contains some of the earliest recordings with guitarist Eric Clapton.

Recorded at the Marquee Club in London on 20 March 1964, it was released in the United Kingdom by Columbia Records nine months later. Despite several favourable retrospective reviews, the album did not reach the UK album charts. It was not issued in the United States; however, four songs were included on the Yardbirds&#x27; second American album, &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot;.

==Background and recording==
In October 1963, the Yardbirds took over the Rolling Stones&#x27; position at the Crawdaddy Club and had signed a management contract with club owner Giorgio Gomelsky. After touring with Sonny Boy Williamson II, the band signed a contract with Columbia Records. In 1964, they recorded two singles, &quot;I Wish You Would&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot;. These had limited success and Gomelsky was able to persuade Columbia to release a live album as the Yardbirds&#x27; debut album.

The Yardbirds were a popular live attraction at music clubs. Much of their reputation was built on their use of a &quot;rave up&quot; musical arrangement, an instrumental interlude that builds to a climax. Clapton credits the rave up to bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and explains: &quot;While most other bands were playing three-minute songs, we were taking three-minute numbers and stretching them out to five or six minutes, during which time the audience would go crazy&quot;. It was at such performances that Clapton often broke a guitar string. While he was putting on a new one, the audience would slowly clap their hands (slow handclapping). This led manager Gomelsky to nickname him &quot;Eric &#x27;Slowhand&#x27; Clapton&quot;.

&quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot; was recorded at the Marquee Club in London. Yardbirds&#x27; biographer Gregg Russo describes the conditions and equipment for recording at the club as less than ideal, but they were able to capitalise on their greater popularity compared to the Crawdaddy. He adds:
==Composition and musical style==
All of the songs that appear on &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot; were written by American blues and rhythm and blues artists and several of the original recordings appeared on the American record charts. The band&#x27;s early material reflects the repertoires of the early British rhythm and blues groups, such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals. Clapton biographer David Bowling described the album as &quot;a lot of straight electric blues, but at times they come close to a rock sound.&quot; Their version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot;, which is the album opener, is the most rock-oriented song on the album.

Several songs feature extended instrumental improvisation. Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Here &#x27;Tis&quot; and the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Respectable&quot; are high-energy tunes, which represent the use of the double-time feature of the rave up for the entire songs. AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes &quot;Here &#x27;Tis&quot; as &quot;driven by a furious &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; beat and rhythm ... Clapton&#x27;s interplay with bassist Paul Samwell-Smith is one of the great moments in the band&#x27;s recorded history&quot;. The instrumental spotlight was also shared with singer and blues harmonica player Keith Relf. Clapton and Relf trading riffs is one of the highlights of &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;. The Howlin&#x27; Wolf song was the Yardbirds&#x27; most popular live number and a regular in their sets. Performances of the song could last up to 30 minutes. Howlin&#x27; Wolf reportedly referred to the group&#x27;s 5:35 album version as &quot;the definitive version of his song&quot;.

The slow blues standard, &quot;Five Long Years&quot;, features extended guitar soloing by Clapton in a style he further developed with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. Clapton and Samwell-Smith share the lead vocals on &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot;, which is based on the version by the American R&amp;B duo Don and Bob. Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; (which became a hit when the Yardbirds later recorded it with Jeff Beck) and songs by Slim Harpo and John Lee Hooker round out the album.

==Release and critical reception==
Columbia Graphophone Company issued &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot; in the UK on 4 December1964. Clapton biographer Christopher Sandford writes that when the album was released &quot;to generally favourable reviews (&#x27;Raucous interplay ... great guitar ... feral energy of the ensemble&#x27;) it, too, failed to materially benefit the group.&quot; The album did not appear in British record charts. Subsequently, it was not issued in the US, but in November 1965 Epic Records (their American label) included four of the tracks on &quot;Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds&quot;. In 1966, Epic planned to release the album in the US with the same tracks as the UK album (although with different cover art), but did not follow through. 

Later critics have given favourable reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s Eder awarded it four and a half out of five stars and described it as &quot;the first importantindeed, essentiallive album to come out of the 1960s British rock &amp; roll boom. In terms of the performance captured and the recording quality, it was also the best such live record of the entire middle of the decade&quot;. In a separate review for AllMusic, Rick Clark noted &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; [and other songs] were open-ended improvisations that helped lay the groundwork for groups like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience.&quot; Bowling calls the material &quot;raw and powerful&quot; and Russo adds that it is &quot;a completely faithful reproduction&quot; of the group&#x27;s early shows. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included the album in its list of &quot;Top 100 Live Albums&quot;, calling it an &quot;explosive document of a British blues band fueling a decidedly American music with power, fireworks and amped-up resourcefulness&quot;.

Aerosmith&#x27;s Joe Perry described himself as &quot;a huge fan of Clapton&#x27;s work on &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot;. Their version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &#x27;Too Much Monkey Business&#x27; was such a blueprint for a lot of what Aerosmith tried to do. The &#x27;Rave Ups&#x27; [instrumental interludes] which were backing up Eric, the solosit was like the band was a slingshot and, as soon as it hit that pocket, he went sailing. Those parts of the songs still give me goosebumps.&quot;

<text>Toy Story 3 is a 2010 American animated comedy-drama film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The third installment in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; series, it was directed by Lee Unkrich, the editor of the first two films and the co-director of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, produced by Darla K. Anderson, and written by Michael Arndt. The film&#x27;s ensemble voice cast includes Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris, Jeff Pidgeon, Jodi Benson, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and R. Lee Ermey. In &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, Andy Davis, now a teenager, is going to college. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the other toys are accidentally donated to the Sunnyside Daycare center by Andy&#x27;s mother, and the toys must decide where their loyalties lie.

In 2004, following disagreements between the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs, Disney planned to make &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; at the new Circle Seven Animation studio unit, with the tentative theatrical release date in early 2008. The script was developed in multiple versions; however, after Disney bought Pixar in early 2006, the Circle Seven version of the film was canceled as the result of Circle Seven&#x27;s closure. The production was then transferred to Pixar, where a new script was developed. Randy Newman returned to compose the film&#x27;s musical score. With a budget of $200 million, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; is one of the most expensive films of all time.

&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; premiered at the Taormina Film Fest in Italy on June 12, 2010, and was released in the United States on June 18. It was the first film to be released theatrically with Dolby Surround 7.1 sound. Like its predecessors, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the vocal performances, screenplay, emotional depth, animation, and Newman&#x27;s musical score. The film earned $1.067 billion worldwide, finishing its theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2010 and the fourth-highest grossing film of all time at the time of its release. It is also the first animated film to reach $1 billion at the box-office, and was the highest-grossing animated film in history until the release of &quot;Frozen&quot; in 2013 and was Pixar&#x27;s highest-grossing film until the release of &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; in 2018. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; one of the top-ten films of 2010. Amongst its numerous accolades, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was nominated for five awards at the 83rd Academy Awards, winning Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song. One of those nominations was for Best Picture, thus making it the third and currently most recent animated film to be nominated for this award (after 1991&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and 2009&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot;), although it lost to &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, was released in 2019.
== Plot ==

Andy Davis, who has not played with his toys in years, is leaving for college, and intends to take Woody with him. Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the others are put in a bag to be stored in the attic, but Andy&#x27;s mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy intended to throw them away, join Barbie in a donation box bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody pursues the others and fails to convince them of the truth.

Andy&#x27;s toys are welcomed by the other toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour of the seemingly perfect play-setting by Lots-O&#x27;-Huggin&#x27; Bear (&quot;Lotso&quot;), Big Baby, and Ken, with whom Barbie falls in love. All the toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return home. A Sunnyside child named Bonnie finds Woody and takes him to her house, playing with him and her other toys.

After Andy&#x27;s toys endure a rough playtime with the toddlers, Buzz asks Lotso to have himself and his friends moved to the older children&#x27;s room, but is instead captured. Lotso is revealed to be running a police state among the daycare&#x27;s toys; he tells Buzz he sends all newly-arrived toys to the toddler room for his gang&#x27;s safety, regardless of whether the new toys are age-appropriate or get broken. Seeing promise in Buzz, Lotso has him switched to demo mode, brainwashing him into believing Lotso is his commander. Meanwhile, Mrs. Potato Head, who lost an eye in Andy&#x27;s room, sees an upset Andy searching for his toys. Andy&#x27;s toys realize their mistake and attempt to leave, but are imprisoned by Buzz on Lotso&#x27;s order.

At Bonnie&#x27;s house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, and learns that Chuckles, Lotso, and Big Baby were once owned by a girl named Daisy. When the three toys were accidentally lost during a road trip, they traveled back to Daisy&#x27;s house on foot, only to find that Daisy&#x27;s parents had replaced Lotso. After convincing Big Baby that Daisy had replaced them, Lotso led the toys to Sunnyside, taking it over as a dictator.

Woody returns to Sunnyside and reunites with his friends. That night, Andy&#x27;s toys initiate an escape plan, inadvertently accidentally resetting Buzz to Spanish mode in the process. &quot;Spanish Buzz&quot; immediately befriends Woody and begins a relationship with Jessie. The toys escape the building, getting as far as Sunnyside&#x27;s dumpster, but Lotso and his gang thwart them. As a trash truck approaches, Woody reveals Lotso&#x27;s deception to Big Baby, who promptly throws Lotso into the dumpster. Andy&#x27;s toys attempt to escape, but Lotso pulls Woody in with him. Andy&#x27;s other toys jump in to help, and fall into the truck, where a junked television hits Buzz and restores him to his normal persona.

The toys are brought to a local trash center, and most of them are dumped on a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso avoid a shredder, and later to reach an emergency stop button, but once he is safe, Lotso abandons them. As Woody and his friends accept their impending fate, Andy&#x27;s Aliens rescue them with an industrial claw. A trash truck driver later finds Lotso and straps him to his truck&#x27;s radiator grille. Woody and his friends ride another garbage truck, driven by an adult Sid Phillips, back to Andy&#x27;s house. Andy discovers a note from Woody and, assuming it is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie, who lives nearby. Andy introduces the toys individually to Bonnie, and is surprised to find Woody at the bottom of the donation box. After Bonnie recognizes Woody, an initially hesitant Andy passes him on to her. Andy plays with Bonnie before leaving; Woody bids him a quiet farewell, and the toys begin their new life with Bonnie.

Later, Woody and the other toys learn that Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have improved the lives of the toys at Sunnyside.

== Production ==
According to the terms of Pixar Animation Studios&#x27; initial seven-film deal with the Walt Disney Company, all characters created by Pixar for their films were owned and controlled by Disney. Furthermore, Disney owned the rights to make sequels to all Pixar films up to and including &quot;Cars&quot;, though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. In 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, Disney chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; at a new Disney studio, Circle Seven Animation. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar was not on board. It was slated for a theatrical release sometime in spring 2008.

Bradley Raymond, who previously directed Disney&#x27;s direct-to-video sequels such as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot; and &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;, was hired to direct the film. Among the scripts Circle Seven had under consideration was one from &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; screenwriters Bill and Cheri Steinkellner. Their idea for the film involves Andy and his toys (Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Jessie, and Bullseye) paying a visit to his grandmother&#x27;s house for the night because his room is getting remodeled. A set of Andy&#x27;s toys and new characters Hee-Hee and Gladiola try to figure out who is stealing the toys one by one in a whodunit-style murder mystery story. Though it was rejected, Disney was so impressed with the script that this version would have been considered for a possible fourth installment.

The final version of the Circle Seven script was written by &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; screenwriter Jim Herzfeld. It focused on Andy&#x27;s toys shipping a malfunctioning Buzz to the factory in Taiwan where he was built called Wocka-Wocka, with the other toys hoping he will be fixed there. While searching on the Internet, they then discovered that many more Buzz Lightyear toys are malfunctioning around the world and the company had issued a massive recall. Fearing Buzz&#x27;s destruction, a group of Andy&#x27;s toys (Woody, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Jessie, and Bullseye) all ship themselves to Taiwan and venture out to rescue Buzz. At the same time, Buzz meets other toys from around the world that were once loved, but have been recalled such as Rosey, a warm cozy toy, and Jade, a leggy doll with an evening gown. Along with meeting the recalled toys, Buzz also meets a new Star Command action figure that was going to be the replacement of Buzz, Daxx Blastar, along with his accessory pet cat named Comet.

In January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a deal that put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter in charge of all Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle Seven Animation was shut down and its alternate version of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was canceled. The following month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney was in the process of transferring the production to Pixar. The studio&#x27;s brain trust, which included John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich, had their own idea for a sequel that they had carried around for years. They retreated to the cabin where they first pitched &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and almost immediately dropped the idea after they felt that it was not good enough. Unable to come up with anything the first day, they watched the first two movies again, and the next day a new story was starting to take shape. Stanton then wrote a treatment.

This story had no traces of the Circle Seven version of the film since the filmmakers did not read its script: &quot;Not out of spite, but we wanted to start fresh, and not be influenced by what they&#x27;d done,&quot; said Unkrich. &quot;We didn&#x27;t look at any of the work they&#x27;d done. We really didn&#x27;t want to know anything about it.&quot; In February 2007, Lasseter announced &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;″s co-director, Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of himself (Lasseter had directed the first two films and was busy directing &quot;Cars 2&quot;), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter. 2010 was also announced as the tentative release date.

Unkrich, who had been working with Arndt and story development artists on the film since the middle of 2006, said that he felt pressure to avoid creating &quot;the first dud&quot; for Pixar, since all of Pixar&#x27;s prior films had been critical and commercial successes. In February 2008, the film&#x27;s plotline was reported: &quot;Woody the cowboy and his toy-box friends are dumped in a daycare center after their owner, Andy, leaves for college.&quot;
During the initial development stages of the film, Pixar revisited their work from the original &quot;Toy Story&quot; and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files, which necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film&#x27;s end, more than a year and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.

Instead of sending Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and John Ratzenberger scripts for their consideration in reprising their roles, a complete story reel of the film was shown to the actors in a theater. The reel was made up of moving storyboards with pre-recorded voices, sound effects, and music. When the preview concluded, the actors signed on to the film. Hanks was paid $15 million for his involvement, the highest salary received for a voice actor.

The film&#x27;s art director, Daisuke Tsutsumi, is married to Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s niece, who originally inspired the character Mei in Miyazaki&#x27;s anime film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (1988). Totoro makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;.

Dolby Laboratories announced that &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; would be the first film to feature theatrical 7.1 surround sound. Thus, even the Blu-ray version would feature original 7.1 audio, unlike other films which were remixed into 7.1 for Blu-ray.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===

&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; had its worldwide premiere on June 12, 2010, opening at Taormina Film Fest in Italy. In the United States, it premiered on June 13, 2010, at El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California. El Capitan also hosted on June 17, 2010, a &quot;Toy Story&quot; marathon, showing for the first time all three &quot;Toy Story&quot; films together. The film went into its wide release on June 18, 2010, along with a release to IMAX 3D theaters.

The film was theatrically accompanied with the Pixar short film &quot;Day &amp; Night&quot;, which focuses on what happens when an animated personification of Day meets his opposite, Night, and the resulting growth for both.

=== Marketing ===
The film&#x27;s first teaser trailer was released with &quot;Up&quot; in Disney Digital 3-D on May 29, 2009. On October 2, 2009, &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; were re-released as a double feature in Disney Digital 3-D. The first full-length trailer was attached as an exclusive sneak peek and a first footage to the &quot;Toy Story&quot; double feature on October 12, 2009. A second teaser was released on February 10, 2010, followed by a second full-length trailer on February 11, and appeared in 3D showings of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;. On March 23, 2010, &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; were released separately on Blu-ray/DVD combo packs; &quot;Toy Story&quot; included a small feature of &quot;The Story of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; included one on the &quot;Characters of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;.&quot;
Mattel, Thinkway Toys, and Lego are among companies that produced toys to promote the film. Fisher Price, a Mattel Company, released &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; with 21 3D images for viewing with the View-Master viewer. Disney Interactive Studios also produced a video game based on the film &quot;Toy Story 3: The Video Game&quot;, which was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS, and PSP on June 15, 2010. A PlayStation 2 version was released on October 30, 2010, as part of a PS2 bundle and separately on November 2, 2010 (the same day &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was released on DVD and Blu-ray). It was also the last Disney/Pixar game to be released for PlayStation 2.

&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was featured in Apple&#x27;s iPhone OS 4 Event on April 8, 2010, with Steve Jobs demonstrating a &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;-themed iAd written in HTML5. Pixar designed a commercial for the toy Lots-O&#x27;-Huggin&#x27; Bear and formatted it to appear as if it came from an old VCR recording. The recording was altered with distorted sound, noise along the bottom of the screen, and flickering video, all designed to make it look like a converted recording from around 1983. A Japanese version of the commercial was also released online, with the name &quot;Lots-O&#x27;-Huggin Bear&quot; replaced with &quot;Little Hug-Hug Bear&quot; (Japanese:ハグハグベアちゃん/&quot;Hagu Hagu Beya-Chan&quot;).

On &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;″ May 11, 2010, episode, the Gipsy Kings performed a Spanish-language version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot;, which featured a paso doble dance choreographed by Cheryl Burke and Tony Dovolani. Both the song and dance are featured in the film. &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was promoted with airings of the first and second film on several channels in the weeks preceding the film&#x27;s release, including Disney Channel, Disney XD, and ABC Family. Sneak peeks of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; were also revealed, primarily on Disney Channel.

==== Oscar campaign ====
&quot;Toy Story 3&quot;″s &quot;Not since...&quot; Oscar campaign drew a lot of attention, emphasizing the film&#x27;s uniqueness and critical acclaim. The campaign consisted of posters featuring characters from the film, comparing &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; to previous winners such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, and more.
Walt Disney Studios Chairman Rich Ross explained they were going for the Best Picture win, not just Best Animated film. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; gave the campaign a bronze award in Key Art Awards Winners 2011.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in North America on November 2, 2010, in a standard DVD edition, a two-disc Blu-ray Disc, and in a four-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack. Features included behind-the-scenes, including a sneak peek teaser for the then-upcoming &quot;Cars 2&quot; (the sequel to the 2006 film &quot;Cars&quot;). A 10-disc &quot;Toy Story&quot; trilogy Blu-ray box set arrived on store shelves that same day. A 3D version of the Blu-ray was released in North America on November 1, 2011.

On its first week of release (November 2–7, 2010), it sold 3,859,736 units (equal to $73,096,452), ranking No.1 for the week and immediately becoming the bestselling animated film of 2010 in units sold (surpassing &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;). As of July 18, 2012, it had sold 10,911,701 units ($185,924,247). It became the bestselling DVD of 2010 in units sold, but it lacked in sales revenue and therefore ranked second behind &quot;Avatar&quot; on that list. It also sold about 4 million Blu-ray units, ranking as the fourth-bestselling film of 2010.

In the United Kingdom, it broke the record for the largest first day ever for an animated feature in sales revenue, on both DVD and Blu-ray. Additionally, on the first day of its iTunes release, it immediately became the most downloaded Disney film ever. &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on June 4, 2019.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; earned $415 million in the United States and Canada and $652 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $1.067 billion, becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time (until it was surpassed by &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) in 2014) and the highest-grossing film of 2010. On its first weekend, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; topped the worldwide box office with $145.3 million ($153.7 million with weekday previews), the ninth-largest opening weekend worldwide for an animated feature. On August 27, 2010 – its seventy-first day of release, it surpassed the $1 billion mark, becoming the third Disney film, the second Disney-distributed film in 2010 (after &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;), the first animated film, and the seventh film in cinematic history to do so.

==== United States and Canada ====
In North America, Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 52 million tickets in the U.S. &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; earned $41.1 million on its opening day (June 18, 2010) from 4,028 theaters, including $4 million at midnight shows from about 1,500 theaters, setting an opening-day record for an animated film (surpassed by &quot;Minions&quot; and later &quot;Finding Dory&quot;).

During its opening weekend, the film topped the box office with $110.3 million, setting an opening-weekend record among Pixar films (surpassed by &quot;Finding Dory&quot;), films released in June (surpassed by &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and later &quot;Jurassic World&quot;), and G-rated films (surpassed by its sequel). The film also achieved the second-largest opening weekend among animated films and the fourth-largest opening weekend among 2010 films. Its average of $27,385 per venue is the second-highest for a G-rated film and the third-highest for an animated feature. Its opening-week gross (Friday through Thursday) of $167.6 million is the second-largest among animated films, the second-largest among 2010 films, and the 23rd-largest of all time. It also achieved the largest 10-day gross among 2010 films. It topped the box office for two consecutive weekends.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Deftly blending comedy, adventure, and honest emotion, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; is a rare second sequel that really works.&quot; Metacritic, another review aggregator which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, gave the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;TIME&quot; named &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; the &quot;best film of 2010&quot; as did Quentin Tarantino until 2020 where the latter ranked fellow 2010 film &quot;The Social Network&quot; as the best film of the 2010s. In 2011, &quot;TIME&quot; ranked the film at #11 on their list of &quot;The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, but down from the &quot;A+&quot; earned by the second film.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated &quot;This film—this whole three-part, 15-year epic—about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love.&quot; Owen Gleiberman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A&quot; saying &quot;Even with the bar raised high, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; enchanted and moved me so deeply I was flabbergasted that a digitally animated comedy about plastic playthings could have this effect.&quot; Gleiberman also wrote in the next issue that he, along with many other grown men, cried at the end of the film. Michael Rechtshaffen of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; also gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;Woody, Buzz and playmates make a thoroughly engaging, emotionally satisfying return.&quot;

Mark Kermode of the BBC gave the film, and the series, a glowing review, calling it &quot;the best movie trilogy of all time.&quot; In &quot;USA Today&quot;, Claudia Puig gave the film a complete 4-star rating, writing &quot;This installment, the best of the three, is everything a movie should be: hilarious, touching, exciting, and clever.&quot; Michael Phillips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that &quot;Compared with the riches of all kinds in recent Pixar masterworks such as &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, &quot;WALL-E&quot;, and &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; looks and plays like an exceptionally slick and confident product, as opposed to a magical blend of commerce and popular art.&quot; Roger Moore of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, wrote &quot;Dazzling, scary, and sentimental, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; is a dark and emotional conclusion to the film series that made Pixar famous.&quot;

Cahiers du Cinéma put it at the fourth place of its top ten best 2010 films.

In 2018, &quot;IndieWire&quot; writers ranked the script the tenth best American screenplay of the 21st century.

=== Accolades ===

At the 83rd Academy Awards, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; received nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Sound Editing; and won Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song. Its other nominations include three Annie Awards, three British Academy Film Awards (winning one), five Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards (winning one), and a Golden Globe Award (which it won). The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; one of the ten-best films of 2010; it also won the National Board of Review&#x27;s Best Animated Film award. In December 2021, the film&#x27;s screenplay was listed number forty-four on the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s &quot;101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)&quot;.

=== Fan project ===
Iowa brothers Morgan and Mason McGrew spent eight years recreating the film in stop motion. Titled &quot;Toy Story 3 in Real Life&quot;, the film was shot using iPhones and was uploaded to YouTube on January 25, 2020. Excluding the scenes with human characters, the shot-for-shot remake uses the film&#x27;s original audio. According to Screen Crush, Pixar&#x27;s parent company Walt Disney Studios gave the McGrews permission to release the film online.

== Music ==

The film score for &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was composed and conducted by Randy Newman, his sixth for Pixar after &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;Cars&quot;. Initially, Disney released the soundtrack only as digital download. This was the second instance where Disney did not release the award-winning soundtrack of a Pixar film on CD, the first being &quot;Up&quot;. In January 2012, Intrada released the &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; soundtrack on CD.
In addition to the tracks included in the soundtrack album, the film also uses several other tracks such as &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; by Gary Wright, &quot;Le Freak&quot; by Chic, and Randy Newman&#x27;s original version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot;. Furthermore, tracks &quot;Cowboy!&quot; and &quot;Come to Papa&quot; included material from Newman&#x27;s rejected score to &quot;Air Force One&quot;. The song &quot;Losing You&quot; from Newman&#x27;s own album &quot;Harps and Angels&quot; was also used in the first trailer for the film. The Judas Priest song &quot;Electric Eye&quot; was also used in the film in the temp score for the opening scene of the film.

== Sequel ==
&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was followed by &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019). It marginally surpassed the box-office take of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, and received a similarly positive critical and audience response. A fifth film, titled &quot;Toy Story 5&quot;, is in development for release on June 19, 2026.

<doc id="1213839" wikidata="Q733473" url="?curid=1213839" title="Gauss (crater)">
<text>Gauss is a large lunar impact crater, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, that is located near the northeastern limb of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It belongs to a category of lunar formations called a walled plain, meaning that it has a diameter of at least 110 kilometers, with a somewhat sunken floor and little or no central massif. Due to its location, this crater appears considerably foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, and its visibility is affected by libration.

To the northeast of Gauss is Riemann, another walled plain that lies even closer to the limb. Southwest of Gauss is the crater pair of Hahn and Berosus. Almost directly southward is Seneca.

The rim of Gauss is better formed in the northern half, and the inner walls have some terracing along the northwest and appear slumped in the northeast. The southern half of the rim is somewhat more eroded.

The interior floor is fairly flat in places, with several craters marking the surface in the southern half. There is also a small crater, Gauss B, lying along the interior of the eastern rim, with the smaller Gauss A lying across the rim just to the northeast of Gauss B. The floor of Gauss is also marked by several clefts, particularly along the eastern and northwestern edges. The uneven crater rims in the south and a series of rises in the north gives the appearance of a ridge line that traverses the crater floor from north to south.

Gauss is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

<doc id="1213840" wikidata="Q7493354" url="?curid=1213840" title="Shelby CSX">
<text>The Shelby CSX (Carroll Shelby eXperimental) is a limited-production high performance automobile based on the turbocharged intercooled Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance. These cars were offered by Shelby Automobiles Inc. from 1987 through 1989.
The CSX serial number was established by AC Cars, in Surrey, England. The purpose of that serial number was to identify which chassis were to be exported to Shelby in the U.S. CSX stood for &quot;Carroll Shelby Export&quot;.

==CSX==

The first Shelby CSX appeared in 1987. Power came from Shelby&#x27;s intercooled Turbo II 2.2 L inline-four, producing 175 hp (130 kW) at 5300 rpm and 175 ft·lbf (237 Nm) of torque from 2200-4800 rpm.

Shock absorbers and springs were replaced, and Daytona Shelby Z rear discs were added. Once again, Shelby used his own wheels. Outside badging was more restrained than other Shelby offerings. Black was the only color available.

750 of the 1987 CSX&#x27;s were sold, priced at $13,495. There was no optional equipment.

==CSX-T==

In 1966, Shelby created a special line of Shelby Mustangs for the Hertz car rental company. Shelby repeated this method in 1988 with the creation of the CSX-T for the Thrifty rental company. The CSX-T was only sold to Thrifty. All 1,001 units produced were white with grey and blue trim.

The CSX-T was mechanically similar to the 1987 CSX, except the non-intercooled Turbo I engine was used. Two variations were made, an intercooled version given to the president of Thrifty and a version with a factory sunroof given to the president&#x27;s daughter.

==CSX-VNT==
The final CSX was 1989&#x27;s CSX-VNT. This would also be the final Shelby Dodge, and marked two notable technological advances: the introduction of a Garrett variable-nozzle turbo (VNT), which was the first application of variable turbine technology in a production car, and the application of composite wheels designed by Shelby and produced by Motor Wheel Corporation, known as &quot;Fiberrides&quot;, which were lighter than contemporary aluminum wheels.
The engine was Chrysler&#x27;s new intercooled Turbo IV equipped with a Getrag A555 5-speed transmission. The variable geometry turbo vanes were computer controlled and needed no wastegate. Instead, they adjusted the flow of exhaust gases to spool up instantly and provide strong power. Chrysler kept the horsepower rating at 175 hp (130 kW), but upped the torque rating to 205 ft·lbs (278 Nm) at 2100 rpm. Full torque was available from this low rpm to well past redline. Turbo lag was eliminated, with full boost (15 psi spike) available at 2100 rpm. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine called it &quot;a high-tech hot rod&quot; and &quot;a technological showcase&quot; and were impressed with the engine&#x27;s flexibility and top-gear acceleration. (They tested it to .) Synthetic oil and premium fuel were specified for use with this car to prevent turbo overheating and prolong engine life. Rather than a proper tune-up (the VNT&#x27;s control systems were advanced for the time), replacing the VNT with the simple but lag-prone turbo II was common. Examples with the VNT system intact are today considered more valuable to collectors. Shelby installed emblems in the engine compartment specifying Mobil 1 synthetic oil only, as he did on other Shelby Dodges. The suspension was also modified, as the alignment specs are radically different from the other Shelby Dodges. On the exterior, Shelby chose Exotic Red, a mix of bright red and maroon, with gold wheels and trim and a ground effects package produced by Kaminari Aerodynamics to set the VNT apart from the standard CSX. The MSRP was $15,995.

Production was limited to 500 vehicles (including two prototypes) and with the completion of cars, Carroll Shelby&#x27;s direct involvement with Dodge was complete (although he continued to work on projects with Chrysler, often taking advisory roles, which included the development of the Dodge Viper and Viper GTS). The 89 Shelby CSX production figures can be broken down into the following: 15 were equipped as &#x27;two option&#x27;, coming factory with 225 wide tire option as well as RECARO bucket seats; 2 were used as prototypes; 2 were equipped with non-RECARO and wide optioned tires. The remaining were either RECARO or non-RECARO equipped cars with regular size tires. The front air dams and rear wing can still be purchased from Kaminari Aerodynamics. The wing is now equipped with an LED brake light built into it. The front air dams are slightly different than the original factory piece.

<text>The ALCO RS-3 is a , B-B diesel-electric locomotive manufactured from May 1950 to August 1956 by American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and its subsidiary Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW). A total of 1,418 were produced: 1,265 for American railroads, 98 for Canadian railroads, 48 for Brazilian railroads, and seven for Mexican railroads.

The RS-3 greatly resembled the RS-1 and RS-2, but it had 100 more horsepower thanks to its 12-cylinder, 1,600 hp ALCO Model 244 engine. It also had some changes to the fuel system and body shape.

Much like the RS-1, many RS-3s served for decades; some are still in use as of 2022.

== Variants ==
RSC-3: an RS-3 that used 3-axle trucks instead of 2-axle trucks. The middle axle on each truck was unpowered. This variant was designed for service on light track, as the extra axles better spread the weight of the locomotive.

RS-3m: an RS-3s whose engines was replaced with the more reliable EMD 567B engine.

==Competition==
ALCO built the RS-3 to compete with EMD, Fairbanks-Morse, and Baldwin Locomotive Works—and in particular with EMD&#x27;s GP7, introduced in 1949.

The arrival of the 1,500-hp GP7 led ALCO, Fairbanks-Morse, and Baldwin to increased the power of an existing locomotive line from and add more improvements to create new locomotive lines. In 1950, Fairbanks-Morse introduced the H-16-44, while Baldwin introduced the Baldwin AS-16. ALCO&#x27;s line was the RS-2, although 31 were built in 1950 with . Fairbanks-Morse&#x27;s line was the H-15-44. Baldwin&#x27;s line was the Baldwin DRS-4-4-1500. EMD kept its GP7 at until 1954, when it introduced the GP9, rated at .

In the end, EMD won the road switcher production race. EMD produced 2,729 GP7s. ALCO produced 377 RS-2s, and 1,418 RS-3s. Fairbanks-Morse produced 30 H-15-44s, and 296 H-16-44s. Baldwin produced 32 DRS-4-4-15s, and 127 AS-16s.

== Exports ==

===Brazil===
In 1952, the Brazilian railway the Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil purchased forty six new RS-3s from the Montreal Locomotive Works. Some are still active as work train engines for CPTM, Supervia, and CBTU – BH respectively São Paulo&#x27;s, Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s and Belo Horizonte&#x27;s commuter railways. In Brazil these units were nicknamed Canadians or Hot Tails.

===Spain===
In 1964, the Spanish railway the Ferrocarril de Langreo purchased four RS-3s from the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis. A fifth unit, number 1604, was purchased in 1971 from the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), a piece of surplus Great Northern Railway stock from the 1970 merger that formed BN. The locomotives served until 1984, when the line was converted to .

<text>J. Herschel is a large lunar impact crater of the variety termed a walled plain crater. The crater is named after British astronomer John Herschel. It is located in the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s surface, and so appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. The southeastern rim of J. Herschel forms part of the edge of the Mare Frigoris lunar mare. To the northwest is the crater Anaximander. Bordering the northern rim is a large, unnamed lunar plain. Just to the south is the small crater Horrebow.

The rim of this crater has been heavily eroded, to the point where it is frequently described as &quot;considerably disintegrated&quot;. The remaining rim survives as a ring of ridges that have been resculpted by subsequent impacts. The interior floor is relatively level, but irregular and marked by a multitude of tiny impacts. The most notable of these are the satellite craters C, D, K, and L, listed in the table below. Horrebow A is attached to the southern rim of the crater, and is overlapped along its southwest rim by Horrebow.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to J. Herschel.

<doc id="1213844" wikidata="Q7772733" url="?curid=1213844" title="The Vinyl Cafe">
<text>The Vinyl Cafe was an hour-long radio variety show hosted by Stuart McLean that was broadcast on CBC Radio and was syndicated to approximately 80 U.S. public radio stations through Public Radio International. It aired on Sunday at noon EST and Tuesday at 11:00 pm EST on CBC Radio One and Saturday at 9 am EST on CBC Radio 2. The program was also available as a CBC podcast, although the podcasts usually contained just McLean&#x27;s stories and essays for studio episodes because of copyright restrictions on recorded music. CBC Radio also aired a separate weekday afternoon program, under the title Vinyl Cafe Stories, which consisted of two previously recorded Dave and Morley stories per episode.

The show was produced independently by McLean and sold to the CBC. Each season had approximately 26 new episodes. Half of those were recorded in the studio and the other half were done with live audiences in theatres across Canada and the United States. One episode was recorded onboard VIA Rail&#x27;s transcontinental passenger train &quot;The Canadian&quot; from the dome observation car, complete with an audience of passengers and featured a rail travel theme. The musical guest was singer songwriter Reid Jamieson.

&quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; stopped touring and producing new episodes following McLean&#x27;s diagnosis with melanoma in November 2015. McLean announced on December 13, 2016, that he required a second round of treatment, meaning further delay in producing new episodes, and that repeats of past shows would stop airing on CBC Radio One effective January 2017 to &quot;make room for others to share their work on the radio.&quot; McLean died on February 15, 2017.

==Content==

&quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; radio show featured essays, short stories, and music; while frequently humorous, the weekly programs often featured wistfully nostalgic Canadiana. Often performed as a live show from local venues across Canada, the show often began with a complimentary sketch of the venue&#x27;s community that, &quot;capture the beauty, history and poetry of Canada’s landscape and people.&quot; These &quot;Postcards from Canada&quot; have been likened the &quot;collection to a family photo album that captures everyday life in Canada.&quot;

A major feature of many of McLean&#x27;s shows were the &quot;Dave and Morley Stories&quot;, which featured a fictional Toronto family. The name &quot;Vinyl Cafe&quot; referred both to the show&#x27;s musical content and the fictional record shop owned by McLean&#x27;s character Dave. This aspect of the show had spawned a number of books of short stories, as well as audio recordings. Another feature was &quot;The Vinyl Cafe Story Exchange&quot;, where listeners were invited to send in personal true stories to the producers who read selections on air. The series also presented an annual set of awards that were called the &quot;Arthur Awards&quot;, which were intended to commend various people who had performed extraordinary good deeds of a small personal nature in the preceding year.

Every episode ended with McLean&#x27;s signature sign-off, &quot;I&#x27;m Stuart McLean, so long for now&quot; and followed by the show&#x27;s folksy guitar theme song, &quot;Happy Meeting In Glory&quot; (as performed by Ry Cooder). The show was produced by Jess Milton. Meg Masters was the &quot;long-suffering&quot; story editor and the show&#x27;s founding producer was Dave Amer. Julie Penner was the musical director.

Since 2012 the show has also aired a &quot;best of&quot; spin-off series under the new title of Vinyl Cafe Stories. It features previously recorded stories about Dave and Morley and organized around a common theme, and with one or two studio-recorded musical tracks, but without the live music or local introductions typical of the original run of the show. In January 2023, long-time Vinyl Cafe producer Jess Milton released a new podcast named &quot;Backstage at the Vinyl Cafe&quot;, which includes McLean’s previously-recorded fictional stories and highlights from &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; radio show and live concerts. 

=== Dave and Morley Stories ===

Although they are not featured in every episode of &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;, the &quot;Dave and Morley Stories&quot; were by far the show&#x27;s most famous segment. The stories, written and read by McLean, himself, described the many misadventures of Dave, his wife Morley, their children and pets, as well as friends and neighbours.

For his live performances, McLean often altered his more well-known stories to keep his audience engaged. Today, selected performances are replayed on the CBC Radio One current affairs show, &quot;The Current&quot;, as holiday programming.

<doc id="1213846" wikidata="Q407895" url="?curid=1213846" title="Sodium borohydride">
<text>Sodium borohydride, also known as sodium tetrahydridoborate and sodium tetrahydroborate, is an inorganic compound with the formula (sometimes written as ). It is a white crystalline solid, usually encountered as an aqueous basic solution. Sodium borohydride is a reducing agent that finds application in papermaking and dye industries. It is also used as a reagent in organic synthesis.
The compound was discovered in the 1940s by H. I. Schlesinger, who led a team seeking volatile uranium compounds. Results of this wartime research were declassified and published in 1953.

==Properties==
The compound is soluble in alcohols, certain ethers, and water, although it slowly hydrolyzes.

Sodium borohydride is an odorless white to gray-white microcrystalline powder that often forms lumps. It can be purified by recrystallization from warm (50 °C) diglyme. Sodium borohydride is soluble in protic solvents such as water and lower alcohols. It also reacts with these protic solvents to produce ; however, these reactions are fairly slow. Complete decomposition of a methanol solution requires nearly 90 min at 20 °C. It decomposes in neutral or acidic aqueous solutions, but is stable at pH 14.

===Structure===
 is a salt, consisting of the tetrahedral  anion. The solid is known to exist as three polymorphs: &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; and &quot;γ&quot;. The stable phase at room temperature and pressure is &quot;α&quot;-, which is cubic and adopts an NaCl-type structure, in the &quot;Fmm&quot; space group. At a pressure of 6.3 GPa, the structure changes to the tetragonal &quot;β&quot;- (space group &quot;P421c&quot;) and at 8.9 GPa, the orthorhombic &quot;γ&quot;- (space group &quot;Pnma&quot;) becomes the most stable.

==Synthesis and handling==
For commercial production, the Brown-Schlesinger process and the Bayer process are the most popular methods. In the Brown-Schlesinger process, sodium borohydride is industrially prepared from sodium hydride (produced by reacting Na and ) and trimethyl borate at 250–270 °C:

Millions of kilograms are produced annually, far exceeding the production levels of any other hydride reducing agent. In the Bayer process, it is produced from inorganic borates, including borosilicate glass and borax ():

Magnesium is a less expensive reductant, and could in principle be used instead:

==Reactivity==
===Organic synthesis===
 reduces many organic carbonyls, depending on the conditions. Most typically, it is used in the laboratory for converting ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. These reductions proceed in two stages, formation of the alkoxide followed by hydrolysis:
:

It also efficiently reduces acyl chlorides, anhydrides, α-hydroxylactones, thioesters, and imines at room temperature or below. It reduces esters slowly and inefficiently with excess reagent and/or elevated temperatures, while carboxylic acids and amides are not reduced at all. 

Nevertheless, an alcohol, often methanol or ethanol, is generally the solvent of choice for sodium borohydride reductions of ketones and aldehydes. The mechanism of ketone and aldehyde reduction has been scrutinized by kinetic studies, and contrary to popular depictions in textbooks, the mechanism does not involve a 4-membered transition state like alkene hydroboration, or a six-membered transition state involving a molecule of the alcohol solvent. Hydrogen-bonding activation is required, as no reduction occurs in an aprotic solvent like diglyme. However, the rate order in alcohol is 1.5, while carbonyl compound and borohydride are both first order, suggesting a mechanism more complex than one involving a six-membered transition state that includes only a single alcohol molecule. It was suggested that the simultaneous activation of the carbonyl compound and borohydride occurs, via interaction with the alcohol and alkoxide ion, respectively, and that the reaction proceeds through an open transition state.

α,β-Unsaturated ketones tend to be reduced by in a 1,4-sense, although mixtures are often formed. Addition of cerium chloride improves the selectivity for 1,2-reduction of unsaturated ketones (Luche reduction). α,β-Unsaturated esters also undergo 1,4-reduction in the presence of .

The -MeOH system, formed by the addition of methanol to sodium borohydride in refluxing THF, reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols. Mixing water or an alcohol with the borohydride converts some of it into unstable hydride ester, which is more efficient at reduction, but the reductant eventually decomposes spontaneously to produce hydrogen gas and borates. The same reaction can also occur intramolecularly: an α-ketoester converts into a diol, since the alcohol produced attacks the borohydride to produce an ester of the borohydride, which then reduces the neighboring ester. 

The reactivity of can be enhanced or augmented by a variety of compounds.

Many additives for modifying the reactivity of sodium borohydride have been developed as indicated by the following incomplete listing.
===Oxidation===
Oxidation with iodine in tetrahydrofuran gives borane–tetrahydrofuran, which can reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols. 

Partial oxidation of borohydride with iodine gives octahydrotriborate:

===Coordination chemistry===
 is a ligand for metal ions. Such borohydride complexes are often prepared by the action of (or the ) on the corresponding metal halide. One example is the titanocene derivative:

===Protonolysis and hydrolysis===
 reacts with water and alcohols, with evolution of hydrogen gas and formation of the corresponding borate, the reaction being especially fast at low pH. Exploiting this reactivity, sodium borohydride has been studied as a prototypes of the direct borohydride fuel cell.

==Applications==
===Paper manufacture===
The dominant application of sodium borohydride is the production of sodium dithionite from sulfur dioxide: Sodium dithionite is used as a bleaching agent for wood pulp and in the dyeing industry.

It has been tested as pretreatment for pulping of wood, but is too costly to be commercialized. 
===Chemical synthesis===
Sodium borohydride reduces aldehydes and ketones to give the related alcohols. This reaction is used in the production of various antibiotics including chloramphenicol, dihydrostreptomycin, and thiophenicol. Various steroids and vitamin A are prepared using sodium borohydride in at least one step.

===Niche or abandoned applications===
Sodium borohydride has been considered as a way to store hydrogen for hydrogen-fueled vehicles, as it is safer (being stable in dry air) and more efficient on a weight basis than most other alternatives. The hydrogen can be released by simple hydrolysis of the borohydride. However, such a usage would need a cheap, relatively simple, and energy-efficient process to recycle the hydrolysis product, sodium metaborate, back to the borohydride. No such process was available as of 2007.

Although practical temperatures and pressures for hydrogen storage have not been achieved, in 2012 a core–shell nanostructure of sodium borohydride was used to store, release and reabsorb hydrogen under moderate conditions.

Skilled professional conservator/restorers have used sodium borohydride to minimize or reverse foxing in old books and documents.

===Education===
A common laboratory demonstration &quot;uncooks&quot; eggs with sodium borohydride, as hydride reagents reduce disulfides to thiols. To uncook an egg, breaking the hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds is not enough. As sodium borohydride is toxic, the egg white uncooked after three hours is not edible, but Vitamin C can be used instead.
